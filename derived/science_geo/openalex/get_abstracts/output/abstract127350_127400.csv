https://openalex.org/W2005613270,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) binds to cis-acting hypoxia-response elements within the erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and other genes to activate transcription in hypoxic cells. HIF-1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits. Here, we demonstrate that HIF-1α contains two transactivation domains located between amino acids 531 and 826. When expressed as GAL4 fusion proteins, the transcriptional activity of these domains increased in response to hypoxia. Fusion protein levels were unaffected by changes in cellular O<sub>2</sub> tension. Two minimal transactivation domains were localized to amino acid residues 531–575 and 786–826. The transcriptional activation domains were separated by amino acid sequences that inhibited transactivation. Deletion analysis demonstrated that the gradual removal of inhibitory domain sequences (amino acids 576–785) was associated with progressively increased transcriptional activity of the fusion proteins, especially in cells cultured at 20% O<sub>2</sub>. Transcriptional activity of GAL4/HIF-1α fusion proteins was increased in cells exposed to 1% O<sub>2</sub>, cobalt chloride, or desferrioxamine, each of which also increased levels of endogenous HIF-1α protein but did not affect fusion protein levels. These results indicate that increased transcriptional activity mediated by HIF-1 in hypoxic cells results from both increased HIF-1α protein levels and increased activity of HIF-1α transactivation domains."
https://openalex.org/W2070955854,"Two NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase-encoding cDNAs were isolated from an Arabidopsis cDNA library by metabolic interference in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant disrupted for its endogenous cpr1gene. ATR1 encodes a protein of 692 amino acids, whileATR2 encodes either a 712-residue protein (ATR2-1), or a 702-residue protein (ATR2-2) depending on the choice of the initiation codon. Comparative analysis of ATR1 and ATR2-1 indicates 64% amino acid sequence identity and the absence of conservation in the third base of conserved amino acid codons. The two Arabidopsisreductases are encoded by distinct genes whose divergence is expected an early event in angiosperms evolution. A poly(Ser/Thr) stretch reminiscent of a plant chloroplastic targeting signal is present at the ATR2-1 N-terminal end but absent in ATR1. The cDNA open reading frames were expressed in yeast. The recombinant polypeptides were found present in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum membrane and exhibited a high specific NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity. To gain more insight into the respective functions of the two reductases, the Arabidopsis cDNA encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (CYP73A5) was cloned and co-expressed with ATR1 or ATR2 in yeast. Biochemical characterization of the ArabidopsisATR1/CYP73A5 and ATR2-1/CYP73A5 systems demonstrates that the two distantly related Arabidopsis reductases similarly support the first oxidative step of the phenylpropanoid general pathway.

P450 monooxygenases are involved in various biosynthesis pathways and in degradation of a large range of exogenous compounds (1Porter T.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol.

In plants, besides their roles in herbicide and pesticide detoxication (3Sanderman Jr., J.H. Pharmacogenet. 1994; 4: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar,4Hallahan D.L. Cheriton A.K.

Genet. 1994; 27: 93-113Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), P450s are widely involved in several secondary metabolisms such as the phenylpropanoid pathway (6Durst F. Benveniste I. Shenckman J.B. Greim H. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 105. Spinger-Verlag, Berlin1993: 293-310Google Scholar, 7Bolwell G.P. Bozak K. Zimmerlin A. Phytochem. 1994; 37: 1491-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This pathway, which leads to important molecules such as lignins, pigments, coumarins, flavonoids, and phytoalexins (6Durst F. Benveniste I. Shenckman J.B. Greim H. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 105. Spinger-Verlag, Berlin1993: 293-310Google Scholar), involves a common oxidative step: the para-hydroxylation of cinnamate catalyzed by a P450 of the CYP73 family. In animals, the microsomal P450 system associates in the same organism multiple P450 isoenzymes but a single ubiquitous NADPH-P450 reductase (CPR). 1The abbreviations used are: CPR, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase; kb, kilobase pair; bp, base pair;CPR1, yeast gene encoding microsomal CPR; HTR1, H. tuberosus CPR1; SCR1, S. cerevisiae CPR; HSR1,Homo sapiens CPR; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; P450, hemethiolate protein P450; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ETBI, experimental third base identity; RTBI, reference third base identity. Conclusive evidence for the presence of a single CPR-encoding gene was provided with Chinese hamster cells, mouse spleen cells (8Simmons D.L. Lalley P.A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 515-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rat hepatocytes (9Porter T.D. Beck T.W. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Unlike animals, higher plants express multiple forms of CPRs as inferred from Western blot analysis of purified material (10Fujita M. Asahi T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1985; 26: 397-405Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Benveniste I. Lesot A. Hasenfratz M.P. Kochs G. Durst F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Durst et al. (12Lesot A. Hasenfratz M.P. Batard Y. Durst F. Benveniste I. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 751-757Google Scholar) have recently isolated two distinct partial length cDNAs (HTR1 and HTR3) from Helianthus tuberosus, corresponding to distinct (2.4- and 2.6-kb) mRNA species. This observation questioned the physiological significance of the multiplicity of plant CPRs. Among hypotheses, one could consider the requirement of different CPRs to support the activities of specific plant P450s or the differential CPR expressions in plant tissues or at various development stages. The possibility of multiple subcellular locations for CPRs in plant-specific organelles in addition to the regular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) location is also of particular interest. To address these questions, full-lengthArabidopsis CPR-encoding cDNAs were cloned by a function-based approach involving complementation in yeast of an endogenous CPR defect. The selection relies on the reduced growth rate and the strong ketoconazole hypersensitivity of a yeast strain, which has been disrupted for the CPR1 gene, which encodes yeast microsomal CPR. The addition of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of yeast P450 lanosterol demethylase, is required for selection due to the presence of alternate electron donors in yeast, making CPR1deletion non-lethal. In the cpr1 strain, the CPR defect and ketoconazole inhibition contribute together to cause a full depletion of ergosterol biosynthesis, leading to cell growth arrest (13Yoshida Y. Aoyama Y. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Screening of an Arabidopsis cDNA library in a multicopy plasmid pFL61 under the transcriptional control of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter (16Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out in the W(R) strain. This strain is engineered to overexpress the yeast CPR in galactose- but not in glucose-containing medium (17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThePGK promoter is active on both carbon sources, allowing complementation by heterologous CPRs of the conditional mutant phenotype induced by culture of transformed W(R) cells on glucose. The isolated Arabidopsis CPRs were further characterized for a physiologic coupling with Arabidopsis cinnamate 4-hydroxylase P450 (CYP73A5) by coexpression in yeast. For that purpose, the Arabidopsis cDNA encoding CYP73A5 was cloned from the same library using a hybridization probe derived from the corresponding H. tuberosus CYP73A1 gene (18Teutsch H.G. Hasenfratz M.P. Lesot A. Stoltz C. Garnier J.M. Jeltsch J.M. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Thermostable Taq andPfu DNA polymerases were from Boehringer Mannheim and Stratagene, respectively. The SequenaseTM (version 2.0) DNA sequencing kit was purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp. The pCRScriptTM cloning kit was from Stratagene. NADPH, horse heart cytochrome c, and cinnamic and coumaric acids were from Sigma, and 2-naphthoic acid was from Aldrich. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303–1B (MAT a;ade2-1; his3-11,-15; leu2-3,-112;ura3-1; trp1-1) is designated as W(N). Yeast strain W(R) was constructed by substitution of the natural promoter of the CPR1 gene (encoding microsomal CPR) by the galactose-inducible and glucose-repressed promoterGAL10-CYC1. WRΔ derives from W(N) by disruption of theCPR1 gene with a TRP1 selection marker (17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pFL61 vector has been previously described (16Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast expression vector pYeDP60 (V60) contains both URA3 andADE2 as selection markers, and an expression cassette constituted by GAL10-CYC1 promoter and PGKterminator sequences surrounding a cDNA insertion polylinker (19Urban P. Cullin C. Pompon D. Biochimie. 1990; 72: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The pGP1 vector contains a 5500-bp-long fragment that encompasses the full CPR1 gene at the HindIII site of pUC19. The pYeDP51 yeast expression vector is identical to pYeDP1/8-2 (20Cullin C. Pompon D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 65: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), except that the PvuII site close to the yeast origin of replication is replaced by a BglII site. Using ORS31 and ORS32 as primers (Table I) and pGP1 as a template, the 428-bp-long CPR1 gene terminator sequence was PCR-amplified and cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19. The 420-bp-long EcoRI-PvuII fragment of the resulting vector was ligated to the EcoRI-PvuII fragment of pYeDP51 encompassing URA3. The 6900-bp-long resulting vector, named pYeDP100, places the inserted cDNA under the transcriptional control of GAL10-CYC1-inducible promoter andCPR1 terminator. By PCR amplification using ORS33 and ORS34 primers and pGP1 as a template, a 631-bp-longHindIII-BglII fragment of the upstream part of the CPR1 promoter has been obtained and cloned in pUC19. TheHindIII-BglII fragment of the CPR1promoter was ligated with the largerHindIII-BglII fragment of pYeDP100, which encompasses URA3, yielding the 5210-bp-long pYeDP110 integrative vector. The pYeDP110 vector bears GAL10-CYC1promoter and CPR1 terminator sandwiching a cDNA insertion polylinker, and the CPR1 5′-noncoding region placed upstream of the URA3 selection marker. The entire integrative fragment can be removed by a NotI digestion. The respective orientation of the two CPR1 noncoding regions allows targeted integration of the expression cassette at theCPR1 locus by homologous recombination.Table ISequence of primers used in the PCR amplificationsPrimer nameSequenceATC4H-5ggatccATGACCTCCTCTTGCATC4H-3ggagatcTTAACAGTTCCTTGGORS21gcggatccTTACCATACATCTCTAAGATATCTORS22ccggatccATGTCCTCTTCTTCTTCTTCGTCAACCORS23ccggatccATGATCGATCTCATGGCAGCORS24gcgagatctATGACTTCTGCTTTGTATGCTTCCORS25gggaattcTCACCAGACATCTCTGAGGTATCORS31cgggaattccagctggcggccgcGTATGTTGTCTTTGAAGATGCACCCGTGGGORS32gcggaattcTAATCAGCCCACTGATCAACGTTCGGORS33ccagatctgcggccgcCAGTAAATTCACTTGGAATCACACCGORS34gcgaagcttGCGACAGTAGATCACTTGAAAACCGLowercase and uppercase letters indicate sequences without and with homology to the template DNA, respectively.

Transformation of yeast strains was performed by a modified lithium acetate procedure as described (21Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar), except for the transformation of W(R) cells with the pFL61 library (see below). Transformed cells were selected onto glucose-containing SGI plates. Culture media, cell cultures, and galactose induction procedures of individual clones in both SLI and YPGE were as described previously (17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Urban P. Werck-Reichhart D. Teutsch H.G. Durst F. Regnier S. Kazmaier M. Pompon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A sized (inserts >2 kb) cDNA library fromArabidopsis thaliana seedlings including roots (two-leaf stage) in pFL61 yeast expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. M. Minet. In pFL61, cDNAs were inserted as NotI cassettes between the yeast PGK promoter and terminator (16Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast W(R) cells were grown on galactose, thus overexpressing yeast CPR, up to a cell density of 2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells are harvested and resuspended at a cell density of 106 cells/ml in a glucose-containing YPGA medium, thus turning off CPR1gene expression. W(R) cells were further grown on glucose for 5 h until the microsomal CPR activity decreases to the value found in wild-type W(N) cells. About 108 cells were lithium-treated and used for transformation by 10 μg of the ArabidopsiscDNA library, 0.2 mg of heat-denatured herring sperm DNA in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmEDTA and 0.1 m LiCl. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, 5 ml of the same buffer containing 50% of poly(ethylene)glycol-4000 was added and gently mixed to the previous 2 ml, and the incubation was continued for 20 min at 37 °C and then 5 min at 42 °C. The cells were sprayed in 0.1-ml aliquots onto 20 plates of SGAI synthetic medium for uracil prototrophy selection. Two pools of Ura+ transformants were constituted, and cells from each pool were sprayed at 104 cells/plate onto a series of SGAI plates containing increasing concentrations of ketoconazole (0, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μg/ml ketoconazole) and incubated for 36 h at 28 °C. The 52 clones found to be resistant to 10 and 20 μg/ml ketoconazole were striped on SGAI medium containing 10 μg/ml ketoconazole. The plasmidic DNA of 24 of the resistant clones was rescued in Escherichia coli. The BamHI andHindIII digestion patterns revealed five different restriction profiles (profiles A–E). TheArabidopsis cDNA library in pFL61 was transformed inE. coli by electroporation. About 105independent clones were recovered and transferred on nitrocellulose. The blots were screened by hybridization in SSC × 6 buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.05% milk overnight at 55 °C with the32P-labeled 1800-bp-long cDNA encodingHelianthus CYP73A1 (18Teutsch H.G. Hasenfratz M.P. Lesot A. Stoltz C. Garnier J.M. Jeltsch J.M. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Of 12 independent clones selected, two strongly hybridize with the same probe after subcloning. The plasmidic DNA of one of the two clones, named pCYP73A5, was isolated and the NotI fragment encompassing the full-length cDNA sequenced. The NotI cDNA inserts encoding ATR1 and ATR2 were extracted from pFL61 and subcloned into the unique NotI site of a derivative of pUC9. ForATR1 and ATR2 cDNAs, sequencing was carried out with M13 universal oligonucleotides and a series of specific oligonucleotides belonging to the sequences. For CYP73A5cDNA, the sequencing using M13 universal oligonucleotides was performed by using nested deletions with exonuclease III of pCYP73A5 digested by KpnI and HindIII. Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure. The Arabidopsis genomic DNA (kindly provided by Dr. Clint S. Chapple) was digested withBamHI, EcoRI, or HindIII. The digested aliquots (10 μg) were separated by 0.8% agarose electrophoresis and then transferred to a Nylon membrane (Schleicher and Schüll). The blotted membrane was probed in stringent conditions with32P-labeled ATR1 or ATR2 open reading frame. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as described previously (19Urban P. Cullin C. Pompon D. Biochimie. 1990; 72: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The 2079-bp-longATR1 coding sequence was PCR-amplified using ORS24 and ORS25 primers with 10 ng of pFL61/ATR1 as template. These primers introduce aBglII site immediately upstream of the ATG codon and aEcoRI site downstream of the stop codon of the PCR-amplified fragment. The 2139-bp-long ATR2-1 coding sequence was PCR-amplified using the combination of ORS21 and ORS22 primers, and the 2109-bp-long ATR2-2 coding sequence was PCR-amplified using ORS21 and ORS23 primers and 10 ng of pFL61/ATR2 as template in both cases. The three ATR2 primers introduce a BamHI site immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon and downstream of the stop codon of the PCR-amplified fragments. The expected PCR-amplified products were cloned at the SmaI site of pUC19, giving, respectively, pUC19/ATR1, pUC19/ATR2-1, and pUC19/ATR2-2. The ATR1 coding sequence was then excised by BglII-EcoRI digestion and inserted into pYeDP60 linearized at BamHI andEcoRI unique sites, resulting in plasmid pATR1/V60. The ATR2-1 and ATR2-2 coding sequences were excised by BamHI digestion and inserted into pYeDP60 linearized at BamHI site, a clone with the proper orientation was chosen for each insert giving, respectively, pATR2-1/V60 and pATR2-2/V60. Amplification of the 1518-bp-long CYP73A5 coding sequence was performed by PCR using ATC4H-5 and ATC4H-3 primers, and the product was cloned at the SfrI site of pCRScript vector, giving pCRScript/ATC4H. The primers introduce a BamHI site immediately upstream of the ATG codon and aBglII site downstream of the stop codon. The coding sequence was excised by BamHI-BglII digestion and inserted at the BamHI site of pYeDP60, and a clone with the correct orientation was selected and named pATC4H/V60. The ATR1 and ATR2-1 open reading frames were isolated from pUC19/ATR1 and pUC19/ATR2-1 as BamHI-EcoRI andBamHI-BamHI fragment, respectively. TheATR1 fragment was inserted at theBamHI-EcoRI sites of pYeDP110, yielding pATR1/DP110. Similarly, the ATR2-1 fragment was inserted at the uniqueBamHI site of pYeDP110, and a clone with the proper orientation was selected and named pATR2-1/DP110. The NotI fragment of each plasmid encompassing URA3 and the ATR coding sequence was isolated and used to transform WRΔ cells. Since in WRΔ the CPR1 locus is disrupted with theTRP1 gene, integration events result in a phenotype shift from Ura− Trp+ to Ura+Trp−. This procedure yielded two new yeast strains, WAT11 (for ATR1) and WAT21 (for ATR2-1). They express theArabidopsis CPR instead of the yeast enzyme when grown on galactose. On glucose, WAT cells express no CPR activity. TheURA3 selection marker in both WAT strains was mutated toura3 by selecting 5-fluoroorotate-resistant clones (23Boeke J. Lacroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), giving WAT11U and WAT21U strains. W(R) and WAT cells were harvested after a 12-h galactose induction and microsomal fractions prepared as described in Ref. 17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. P450 content in yeast microsomes was calculated from the reduced carbon monoxide difference using a differential absorption coefficient (450versus 490 nm) of 91 mm−1·cm−1 (24Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Pierce BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein microassay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase activity was assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography-monitoring 4-hydroxy-cinnamate production as described previously (22Urban P. Werck-Reichhart D. Teutsch H.G. Durst F. Regnier S. Kazmaier M. Pompon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For naphthoate hydroxylation reactions, activity was determined using a 1-ml assay mixture containing 120 μm NADPH, various concentrations of 2-naphthoate, and the microsomal aliquot in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The time dependence of the fluorescence emission was monitored at 440 nm, the excitation wavelength being set at 290 nm. The rate of the 2-naphthoate 6-hydroxylation reaction was calculated from the slope of the linear graph obtained. Transformed yeast was grown and assayed for cinnamate bioconversion essentially as described in Refs. 17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 22Urban P. Werck-Reichhart D. Teutsch H.G. Durst F. Regnier S. Kazmaier M. Pompon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar. CPR activity was measured on microsomal fractions as described previously (22Urban P. Werck-Reichhart D. Teutsch H.G. Durst F. Regnier S. Kazmaier M. Pompon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The rate of cytochrome c reduction was calculated using a differential absorption coefficient of 21 mm−1·cm−1 at 550 nm. The rates of dichlorophenolindophenol and ferricyanide reductions were monitored, respectively, at 600 nm (22 mm−1·cm−1) and 420 nm (1 mm−1·cm−1). Yeast cells W(R) that carry the CPR1 gene under the transcriptional control of the galactose-inducible GAL10-CYC1 promoter were transformed with the Arabidopsis cDNA expression library in pFL61 (16Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar). Extinction of the modified CPR1 gene, when glucose is used as a carbon source for culture, is not lethal (14Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, yeast CPR deficiency caused a dramatic lowering in transformation efficiency due to changes in the cell wall structure. This led us to the design of an “on the fly” transformation strategy (see “Experimental Procedures”). The ketoconazole resistance criterion was used for the selection of clones expressing constitutively an alternate CPR in the pFL61-based cDNA expression library. Approximately 105 Ura+ colonies were selected, pooled, and sprayed on a series of SGAI plates containing increasing ketoconazole concentrations. Fifty-two colonies were sorted out as resistant to 10 and 20 μg/ml ketoconazole. Twenty-four of them, selected at random, were further analyzed by restriction digestion. Five types of restriction profile were evidenced: A (7 clones), B (6 clones), C (5 clones), D (1 clone), and E (5 clones). The plasmidic inheritance of the ketoconazole resistance associated with each type of sequence was tested by transforming WRΔ, a yeast strain carrying a permanent CPR1 disruption. Four (A, B, C, and E) of the five plasmid classes were shown to confer ketoconazole resistance at 40 μg/ml to WRΔ. Partial cDNA sequencing was used for further identification and showed that classes A, C, and E (∼2300-bp-long cDNA NotI fragment) contain related inserts differing only by their orientation and their 5′- and 3′-noncoding extremities when class B (2199-bp-long NotI insert) appeared containing a different open reading frame. The relative amounts of bothATR mRNAs in the plant were estimated by transformingE. coli with the Arabidopsis cDNA library in pFL61. Out of 104 independent clones, two hybridizeATR1 probe and seven hybridize ATR2 probe (not shown). This result demonstrates that in the cDNA library used,ATR1 cDNA is 3 times less represented thanATR2 cDNA. The cDNA inserts of class B and C plasmids were sequenced on both strands. TheATR1 cDNA is 2199 bp long and encompasses 69 bp of the 5′-noncoding region followed by a 2079-bp-long open reading frame and 51 bp of the 3′-noncoding region (Fig. 1). A termination TGA codon (from −13 to −15) immediately precedes in frame the first putative initiation codon. The first methionine codon ofATR1 cDNA closely matches the dicot plant initiator codon consensus sequence (25Cavener D.R. Ray S.C. Nucleic Acid Res. 1991; 19: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The ATR1 open reading frame encodes a protein of 692 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 76,720 Da, similar to that of rat liver CPR (77 kDa) (26Porter T.D. Kasper C.B. Proc.

The 2290-bp-long ATR2 cDNA, also obtained as a full-length clone, consists of a 2139-bp-long open reading frame sandwiched by a 5′-noncoding region of 50 bp and a 3′-flanking region of 101 bp (Fig. 2). The ATR2 open reading frame encodes a protein of 712 amino acid residues, which is 64% identical to ATR1, with an estimated molecular mass of 79,077 Da, more similar to the M r observed for higher plant CPRs (11Benveniste I.

The assignment of the starting codon was not straightforward, since the flanking sequence preceding the first ATG ofATR2 cDNA does not contain any stop codon in frame and since two other ATG codons were found in the 15 first codons. Comparison with the consensus sequences around the initiation codon in dicot plant mRNAs (25Cavener D.R. Ray S.C. Nucleic Acid Res. 1991; 19: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) indicates that both the first and the second ATG of ATR2 cDNA could be a suitable translation initiation site; it is therefore difficult to predict which of these is the true starting site. The ATR2 protein encoded by the first ATG was designated ATR2-1 and is 712 residues long; the shorter protein, starting at the second ATG, was named ATR2-2 and is 702 residues long (Fig. 3).Figure 3Comparison of Arabidopsis CPR sequences.

Biomembr. 1994; 26: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), that each ATR presents the conserved segments typical of all known CPRs for the binding of FMN, FAD, and NADPH. In this respect, ATR1 and ATR2 are typical NADPH-P450 reductases. In contrast, no clear sequence similarity is found between the 85 first residues of ATR1 and the 106 first residues of ATR2. However, despite the absence of similarity in their N-terminal part, both ATR1 and ATR2 present in this part an hydrophobic segment that could act as a membrane anchor, as observed in other microsomal CPRs. Another distinct difference between the two ATRs is the net charge of the protein; ATR1 is predicted to be more acidic than ATR2 at neutral pH, exhibiting a calculated chargeversus pH profile very different from those of ATR2 and human and yeast CPRs (Fig. 5). The differences in charge density appear to be mainly localized in the C-terminal moieties of the ATRs. More unusual is the presence at the N terminus of ATR2 of a poly(Ser/Thr) stretch that is not found in any other fungal, plant, or animal CPR. This particular segment could account for the specific glycosylations found in certain higher plant CPRs. The protein ATR2-2, encoded from the second ATG, corresponds to ATR2-1 depleted of this stretch of hydroxylated amino acid residues. Moreover, a second hydrophobic stretch that could serve as a membrane anchor is found at the N-terminal side of the canonic ER membrane-"

Waterfield M.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 358-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The purification and subsequent molecular cloning of PI 3-kinase revealed that it is a heterodimer consisting of p85 and p110 subunits (2Otsu M. Hiles I.D. Gout I. Fry M.J. Ruiz-Larrea F.

Cell. 1991; 65: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit acts to localize PI 3-kinase activity to the plasma membrane by virtue of the interaction of its SH2 domain with phosphorylated tyrosine residues (present in an appropriate local sequence context) in target proteins (6Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of p85 have been identified: p85α, which is ubiquitously expressed, and p85β, which is primarily found in brain and lymphoid tissues (7Volinia S. Patracchini P. Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I. Calzari E. Bernardi F. Rooke L. Waterfield M.D. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 789-793PubMed Google Scholar). The p110 subunit contains the catalytic domain of PI 3-kinase, and three isoforms of p110 have thus far been reported (α, β, and γ) (3Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R.

The identification of p110γ revealed additional complexity within this family of enzymes. p110γ is most closely related to p110α and β (45–48% identity in the catalytic domain) but does not make use of p85 as a targeting subunit. p110γ contains an additional domain termed a pleckstrin homology domain near the amino terminus. The pleckstrin homology domain allows interaction with the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins that appears to regulate its activity and subcellular localization (9Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanov S. Vanhaeseroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.W. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Additional members of this growing gene family include more distantly related lipid and protein kinases such as Vps34, TOR1, and TOR2 ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (and their mammalian homologues such as FRAP and mTOR), the human ataxia telangiectasia gene product, and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (10Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, the primary product of PI 3-kinase activation, are elevated upon treatment of cells with a wide variety of agonists (11Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). This observation has implicated PI 3-kinase activation in a diverse range of cellular responses including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Panayatou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 358-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 577-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The downstream targets of the phosphorylated lipids generated following PI 3-kinase activation have not been well characterized. However some isoforms of protein kinase C are directly activated by phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate in vitro. The protein kinase C-related protein kinase AKT has also been shown to be activated by PI 3-kinase, although the mechanism of this has yet to be determined (14Downward J. Nature. 1995; 376: 553-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase also appears to be involved in a number of aspects of leukocyte activation. PI 3-kinase physically associates with the cytoplasmic domain of CD28, which is an important co-stimulatory molecule for the activation of T cells in response to antigen (15Pages F. Rageneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 16Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1996; 4: 527-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Activation of T cells through CD28 lowers the threshold for activation by antigen and increases the magnitude and duration of the proliferative response. These effects are linked to increases in the transcription of a number of genes including the T cell growth factor interleukin 2 (17Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Creabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Mutation of CD28 such that it can no longer interact with PI 3-kinase leads to a failure to initiate interleukin-2 production, suggesting a critical role for PI 3-kinase in T cell activation (15Pages F. Rageneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Based on studies using the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, there is evidence that PI 3-kinase(s) is also required for some aspects of leukocyte signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (18Thelen M. Wymann M.P. Langen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4960-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We report here the cloning of novel human and murine p110 isoforms (p110δ) with a highly restricted pattern of expression. p110δ is expressed predominantly in leukocytes and may therefore play a role in PI 3-kinase-mediated signaling in the immune system. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed for use in the PCR reaction based on sequences conserved in the catalytic domain of known PI 3-kinases. The sense primer was 5′-GCAGACGGATCCGGIGAYGAYHKIAGRCARGA-3′ encoding the sequence GDDLRQD, and the antisense primer was 5′-GCAGACGAATTCRWRICCRAARTCIRYRTG-3′ (where I is inosine, R is A or G, Y is C or T, H is A, C, or T, W is A or T, and K is G or T) encoding the amino acid sequence HIDFGH. BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites are underlined. PCR reactions consisted of 100 ng of cDNA template (from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) activated for 18 h with 10 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate and 250 ng/ml calcium ionophore (Sigma)), 10 μg/ml oligonucleotide primers, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were performed using denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing at 60 °C for 2 min, and 3 cycles of extension for 1 min at 72 °C. The procedure was then repeated using a 56 °C annealing temperature for 3 cycles, 52 °C annealing temperature for 3 cycles, and 50 °C annealing temperature for 30 cycles. Amplified products were gel-purified, digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and subcloned into the vector pBluescript SKII+ (Stratagene) for sequencing. All DNA for sequencing was prepared using the Wizard Miniprep DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). Sequencing was performed on the Applied Biosystems model 373 automated sequencer. Data bank searches were performed using the BLAST program, and protein and DNA alignments were made using the Geneworks program (Intelligenetics Inc., Mountain View, CA). One clone contained a 399-base pair insert that encoded a 133-amino acid open reading frame showing ∼80% identity with p110β. To identify a full-length cDNA (which we subsequently termed p110δ), specific oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the sequence of the PCR product. The forward primer was 5′-CATGCTGACCCTGCAGATGAT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AACAGCTGCCCACTCTCTCGG-3′. These were used to screen the aforementioned human PBMC cDNA library. Successive rounds of PCR were first performed on pools of 100,000 clones and subsequently on smaller pools until a single clone (termed PBMC 249) was isolated by colony hybridization using the PCR product (labeled by random priming) as a probe. This cDNA was not full-length. Therefore, to identify longer cDNA clones, the same approach was used to screen a cDNA library from human macrophages (19Tjoekler L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). This led to the isolation of an additional cDNA (M928) that extended the cDNA sequence by 1302 base pairs at the 5′ end. The remaining 5′ end of the cDNA was obtained by 5′ RACE PCR (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA.) Two antisense cDNA-specific oligonucleotide primers were designed at the 5′ end of cDNA M928 for RACE PCR reactions. The primary RACE primer was 5′-GGGCCACATGTAGAGGCAGCGTTCCC-3′. The nested RACE primer was 5′-GGCCCAGGCAATGGGGCAGTCCGCC-3′. Marathon RACE reactions were set up using a human leukocyte Marathon-ready cDNA template and the Advantage core PCR reaction kit (CLONTECH) following manufacturer protocol. Touchdown PCR cycling conditions were modified to improve the specificity of the Marathon RACE PCR primary reaction as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing and extension at 72 °C for 3 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing and extension at 70 °C for 3 min, and 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing and extension at 68 °C for 3 min. The 5′ RACE PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into the TA vector PCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer instructions. Three independent clones were sequenced. A full-length cDNA for p110δ was assembled from clones 249, 928, and the 5′ RACE PCR products. The 5′ RACE product ODH18 was used as a template in the PCR using the primers ODH5′ FLAG, 5′-AGTTACGGATCCGGCACCATG(GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG)CCCCCTGGGGTGGACTGCCC-3′ and ODH3′ Paste 5′-CCACATGTAGAGGCAGCGTTCC-3′. The 5′ primer includes a BamHI site (underlined) and encodes the peptide sequence DYKDDDDK (shown in parentheses), which is recognized by the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems). The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI andAflII and was ligated along with anAflII/PvuI fragment derived from the clone M928 and a PvuII/XbaI fragment derived from PBMC clone 249 into the BamHI/XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid, (pcDNA3:FLAG/p110δ), uses the cytomegalovirus promoter to drive the expression of full-length p110δ preceded by an initiating methionine residue and the FLAG epitope. cDNA encoding a fragment (amino acids 141–291) of mouse p110δ termed Rip36 (Ras-interacting protein) was identified by screening a mouse embryo library using Ha-RasV12 as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast two-hybrid system and the plasmids have been described (20Vojtek A. Cooper J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ end of the cDNA was obtained by RACE PCR using the reaction conditions described in Vojtek et al. (21Vojtek A. Hollenberg S. Cooper J. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) and the following specific oligonucleotides: 1) for the reverse transcription reaction, 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCTGACACGCAATAAGCCG-3′; 2) cDNA-specific primer 1, 5′-TAGGCACCTGCAGATGTACTG-3′; and 3) cDNA-specific primer 2, 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCTGACACGCAATAAGCCG-3′. The template for the reverse transcription reaction was spleen RNA from adult mouse, prepared as described (21Vojtek A. Hollenberg S. Cooper J. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of cDNAs present after the RT-PCR reaction identified 558 nucleotides of p110δ coding sequence, corresponding to amino acids 1–186 and 36 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated region. An in-frame stop is present 12 nucleotides upstream of the predicted initiating ATG. The 3′ end of murine p110δ was obtained by RACE PCR using the Expand PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer instructions. The cDNA-specific oligonucleotides used for amplification are 5′-GCCAGTTTTGTGAAGAGGCTG-3′ and 5′-AGCGGATCCCAGTACATCTGCAGGTGCCTAC-3′. A product of 3.6 kilobases was subcloned, restriction mapped, and sequenced. This cDNA contains 2,415 nucleotides of p110δ coding sequence followed by 3′-untranslated region. A full-length cDNA for the mouse p110δ was obtained by reverse transcription of spleen RNA from adult mice followed by 35 cycles of PCR using the Expand system (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer instructions and the following two cDNA-specific oligonucleotides: 5′-GGAAGATCTTGGCGATGCCCCCTGGGGTGGACTGC-3′ and 5′-GGAAGATCTGCGGCCGCCTACTGTCGGTTATCCTTG-3′. The latter oligonucleotide was also used in the reverse transcription reaction. The reverse transcription reaction contained the following components/10 μl reaction: 2 μg of total spleen RNA from adult mice, 4 pmol of the gene-specific primer, 1 μl of 10 mmdNTPs (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 1 unit of RNasin (Promega), 200 units of Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 μl of 5 × RT buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Life Technologies), 5 mm dithiothreitol. The RT reaction was incubated at 44 °C for 2 h. Five μl of the RT reaction was amplified by PCR in a reaction volume of 50 μl using the Expand system (Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction conditions were denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 3.5 min. The cDNA was subcloned directly to the pT7 blue T vector (Novagen) and subsequently transferred to the mammalian expression vector pEBG, which drives the expression of a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein, including the complete coding sequence of mouse p110δ (22Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled [32P]cDNA probes were prepared by PCR using 10 ng of plasmid DNA template encoding p110δ. The forward primer was 5′-CTGCCATGTTGCTCTTGTTGA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GAGTTCGACATCAACATC-3′. PCR reactions contained 50 mmKCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and 1 μm dCTP, 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN), 10 μg/ml cDNA-specific primers, and 2 units ofTaq DNA polymerase. Reactions were heated for 4 min at 94 °C followed by 15 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55 °C, and extension for 2 min at 72 °C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passing the reaction over a Sephadex G-50 column (Boehringer Mannheim). A multiple tissue northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed and washed under stringent conditions according to manufacturer recommendations. The autoradiograph was exposed for 1–4 days at −80 °C with intensifying screens. The epitope-tagged p110δ was transfected into COS cells using DEAE dextran (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor1989: 1642-1644Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, the cells were serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% fetal bovine serum. The plates were rinsed once with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 3 ml of buffer R per confluent 150-mm plate (buffer R is 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin). p110δ was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak Scientific Imaging) according to manufacturer recommendations. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer R and twice with PAN buffer (100 mmNaCl, 10 mm PIPES, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) and resuspended in PAN buffer. One-tenth of the immunoprecipitates were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 10 μl containing 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (Sigma), 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MnCl2, 0.45 mm EGTA, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm ATP. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl. The phospholipids were extracted once with 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) and once with 80 μl of HCl/methanol (1:1), lyophilized to dryness, resuspended in 10 μl of chloroform/methanol, and spotted onto a 1% potassium oxalate-impregnated silica 60 thin layer chromatography plate (V. W. R. Scientific). The phospholipids were resolved by ascending chromatography in chloroform, methanol, 4m NH4OH (9:7:2) and visualized by autoradiography. Crude phospholipid standards (Sigma) were run in parallel with the radiolabeled samples and visualized by exposing the plate to iodine vapor. Using a strategy based on amplification of conserved PI 3-kinase sequences, we have identified a novel human member of this family that we have termed p110δ. A combination of cDNA library screening and 5′ RACE PCR has led to the identification of cDNAs encompassing the complete coding region of p110δ. The deduced amino acid sequence of p110δ is shown in Fig. 1. In an independent search for mouse Ha-RasV12-interacting proteins (Rips) using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified two clones related in sequence to p110β: Rip31 and Rip36. Using a PCR-based strategy and gene-specific oligonucleotide primers derived from the Rip36 sequence, a full-length cDNA was isolated (see “Materials and Methods”). Sequence analysis suggests that this clone is the murine p110δ, since it shares 94% amino acid sequence identity with human p110δ (compared with 56% identity between human p110δ and β; an alignment of human and mouse p110δ is shown in Fig. 1) and has a similar pattern of expression in vivo (see below). The sequences of human and murine p110δ include open reading frames predicted to encode for proteins of 1044 and 1043 amino acids, respectively, with an expected molecular mass of 119,505 Da for the human clone (∼120 kDa). The sequences around the predicted initiating methionines are in good agreement with that required for optimal translational initiation (24Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The presence of stop codons in the 5′-untranslated sequence is consistent with isolation of the complete coding region of p110δ (data not shown). Consistent with the predicted size of the encoded translation product, Western blotting of immunoprecipitates from COS cells transiently transfected with an epitope-tagged form of human p110δ detected a protein of ∼110 kDa (see below). Comparison of the sequence of the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of p110δ with those of other PI 3-kinases reveals that it is most closely related to p110β. p110δ is 72% identical to p110β in this region and is less closely related to p110α (49%) or p110γ (45%), whereas cpk/p170 and the yeast Vps34 protein show the lowest homology (31 and 32%, respectively). This is confirmed by dendrogram analysis; p110β and p110δ form a distinct sub-branch of the PI 3-kinase family (Fig. 2). The distantly related ataxia telangiectasia gene product and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase have been included for comparison (Fig. 2). These proteins are structurally related to PI 3-kinases and have protein kinase activity (25Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.H. Plug A.W. Christienson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M.

When either epitope-tagged human (Fig. 3, panel B) or mouse (Fig. 4, lane 4) p110δ was expressed in COS or 293T cells and recovered by immunoprecipiation, a 85-kDa protein was detected with p85-specific antiserum in the immunoprecipitates. Thus, both human and murine p110δ associate with endogenous p85 after transfection into COS or 293T cells, respectively. Association of human p110δ with p85 could also be detected following expression of epitope-tagged p110δ in the lymphoid cell line Jurkat (data not shown). The association of p110α, p110β, and p110δ with p85 is consistent with the presence of a conserved p85 interaction domain at the amino terminus of these isoforms. This region is lacking in p110γ, which is targeted to the plasma membrane via its interaction with the β/γ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. This interaction is dependent on a p110γ-specific adaptor protein, p101 (28Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P.

Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 30Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). A specific region at the amino terminus of the p110α subunit, residues 133–314, termed the Ras regulatory domain (underlined in Fig. 1), is responsible for this interaction (30Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequence of both human and murine p110δ with other p110 subunits indicates that this region is also conserved in p110δ, including a lysine residue (residues 227 of p110α and 223 of p110δ), which has been shown to be essential for physical association with Ras (30Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Moreover, a relatively short amino acid domain of p110δ (amino acids 141–291, the amino acids of p110δ encoded by the Rip36 clone) is sufficient to interact with Ha-RasV12 in vivo in the yeast two-hybrid system and further delineates the Ras regulatory domain to a 151-amino acid region. The interaction of Ha-RasV12 with this domain of p110δ requires active Ras and an intact Ras effector domain (data not shown). Thus, p110δ is likely to mediate some of the effects of Ras, although the p110δ Ras-interacting region is less conserved than the putative p85 binding site or catalytic domain. Whereas the activation of PI 3-kinase in a wide range of biological systems has been extensively studied, less is known concerning the cell type-specific expression of particular p110 isoforms. Northern blot analysis of the expression of p110δ in human and murine tissues reveals a single transcript of ∼5.4 kilobases (consistent with the size of the composite cDNAs). In humans, the highest levels of expression are seen in PBMC, spleen, and thymus (Fig.5). After prolonged exposure of the autoradiograph, low levels of p110δ expression could be detected in testes, uterus, colon, and small intestine but not in other tissues examined including prostate, heart, brain, and liver (data not shown.) p110δ is also abundantly expressed in adult mouse spleen as well as in testis (Fig.5 B). The elevated expression of p110δ mRNA in mouse but not human testes is noteworthy and may reflect a true difference in expression between species. Alternatively, a number of genes is expressed specifically at elevated levels in postmeiotic haploid cells in the testis. Abnormally sized transcripts that may be more stable than the transcripts found in diploid cells are commonly found. However, it is not clear whether these transcripts are translated (Ref.31Sorrentino V. McKinney M.D. Giorgi M. Geremia R. Fleissner E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2191-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and references cited therein). In the case of p110δ, the RNA expressed in the testis may or may not be translated. If p110δ protein is expressed, then it is possible that the protein has a specific role in development of the male germ line. The restricted expression of p110δ is in contrast to p110α and p110β, which appear to be widely expressed (3Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayatou G. Ruiz-Larrea F.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7677-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To test whether p110δ has PI 3-kinase activity, immunoprecipitates from COS cells transfected with epitope-tagged p110δ were incubated with [32P]ATP and phosphatidylinositol, and the radiolabeled phospholipids were resolved by chromatography. A product was detected that migrates slightly slower than the PI 4-phosphate (PIP) standard, consistent with the generation of PI 3-phosphate (32Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). This enzyme activity was sensitive to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when purified phosphatidylinositol was used as a substrate (data not shown). Whereas these results demonstrate that the cDNA clone that we isolated encodes a functional PI 3-kinase, it cannot be assumed that thein vitro substrate specificity of a particular isoform reflects its activity on membrane lipids in intact cells (11Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The interaction of multiple p110 catalytic subunit isoforms, p110α, p110β, and p110δ, with a common adaptor protein, p85, suggests that the nature of the phosphorylated lipids generated in response to a particular agonist may be regulated at least in part by the cell/tissue-specific expression of the different isoforms of the catalytic subunit. In cells such as leukocytes, where it is likely that multiple p110 isoforms are expressed, it will be of interest to determine the relative contribution made by these multiple isoforms to processes such as cell activation and migration.

This gene encodes a protein highly homologous to S. cerevisiae yAP-1, a bZip transcription factor known to mediate cellular resistance to toxicants such as cycloheximide (CYH), 4-nitroquinolineN-oxide (4-NQO), cadmium, and hydrogen peroxide. The gene was named CAP1, for C. albicansAP-1. Cap1 and yAP-1 are functional homologues, since CAP1 expression in a yap1mutant strain partially restores the ability of the cells to grow on toxic concentrations of cadmium or hydrogen peroxide. We have found that the expression of YBR008c, an open reading frame identified in the yeast genome sequencing project and predicted to code for a multidrug transporter of the major facilitator superfamily, is dramatically induced in S. cerevisiae cells overexpressingCAP1. Overexpression of either CAP1 orYAP1 in a wild-type strain results in resistance to FCZ, CYH, and 4-NQO, whereas such resistance is completely abrogated (FCZ and CYH) or strongly reduced (4-NQO) in a ybr008c deletion mutant, demonstrating that YBR008c is involved inYAP1- and CAP1-mediated multidrug resistance.YBR008c has been renamed FLR1, forfluconazole resistance 1. The expression of an FLR1-lacZ reporter construct is strongly induced by the overexpression of either CAP1 orYAP1, indicating that the FLR1 gene is transcriptionally regulated by the Cap1 and yAP-1 proteins. Taken collectively, our results demonstrate that FLR1 represents a new YAP1-controlled multidrug resistance molecular determinant in S. cerevisiae.

A number of studies investigating the mechanisms of FCZ resistance in C. albicans and other Candidaspecies have shown that resistant strains fail to accumulate FCZ due to an increased drug efflux, suggesting the participation of transporter-mediated drug resistance mechanisms in these strains (45Hitchcock C.A.

Two C. albicans genes coding for transporters of the ABC superfamily, CDR1 and CDR2, have been recently isolated by complementation of an S. cerevisiae pdr5 null mutant (50Prasad R. Dewergifosse P. Goffeau A. Balzi E. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 51Sanglard D. Ischer F. Monod M. Bille J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In addition, the C. albicans BEN r gene, coding for a multidrug transporter of the MF superfamily, has been cloned through its ability to confer benomyl resistance when overexpressed in S. cerevisiae (52Fling M.E. Kopf J. Tamarkin A. Gorman J.A. Smith H.A. Koltin Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 318-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 53Ben-Yaacov R. Knoller S. Caldwell G.A. Becker J.M. Koltin Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).CDR1, CDR2, and BEN r have been shown to be overexpressed in C. albicans clinical and experimental FCZ-resistant isolates (47Sanglard D.

Microbiology. 1997; 143: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the transcriptional induction of these transporters in response to drug exposure have not yet been elucidated. In this report, we describe the identification of a new molecular determinant of C. albicans FCZ resistance by functional overexpression in S. cerevisiae. This gene, namedCAP1, codes for a bZip transcription factor structurally and functionally related to S. cerevisiae yAP-1 (25Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A search for the transcriptional target(s) of Cap1 mediating FCZ resistance inS. cerevisiae has identified FLR1, predicted to code for a transporter of the MF superfamily highly homologous toC. albicans BEN r, as being an MDR effector of both Cap1 and yAP-1 (5André B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1575-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Goffeau A. Park J. Paulsen I.T. Jonniaux J.-L. Dinh T. Mordant P. Saier M.H.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This is the first demonstration that yeast AP-1 proteins can confer MDR by transcriptionally regulating the expression of a transporter of the MF superfamily. S. cerevisiae diploid strain W303 (a/α ade2/ade2 his3/his3 leu2/leu2 trp1/trp1 ura3/ura3 can1/can1) was a gift from M. Whiteway (National Research Council of Canada, Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal, Canada). Strains S150-2B (a leu2 ura3 trp1 his3) and DJY125 (a leu2 ura3 trp1 his3 yap1::TRP1) were kindly provided by D. Jamieson (University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom) (35Stephen D.W. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in YPD medium or in synthetic dextrose (SD) medium lacking uracil (SD −ura), leucine (SD −leu), or histidine (SD −his) (54Sherman F. Method Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Cell transformations were performed by the lithium acetate procedure (55Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were routinely grown at 30 °C. Stock solutions of FCZ (provided by Pfizer Canada Inc., Arnprior, Ontario) and CYH (Sigma, Mississauga, Ontario) were prepared in water at 10 mg/ml. Stock solutions of 4-NQO (Sigma) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 5 mm. Cadmium sulfate (MAT Laboratory, Beauport, Québec) was dissolved in water at 50 mm. Stocks were aliquoted and kept at −80 °C. A YEp352-based C. albicans genomic DNA library (a gift from C. Boone, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia) was introduced in W303 cells (56Boone C. Sdicu A. Laroche M. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6859-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YEp352 is a URA3-based, multicopy vector (57Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Ura+ transformants were selected on SD −ura plates, harvested, and plated on YPD plates containing FCZ at 500 μg/ml. Plasmids from resistant colonies were recovered, analyzed by restriction mapping, and found to carry identical genomic DNA inserts. Plasmid pF1 was chosen for further characterization. Secondary pF1 transformants were found to be resistant to FCZ, thus confirming the plasmid dependence of the resistance phenotype. A 3-kbSmaI-PstI fragment from pF1 was subcloned in plasmid YEp352 cleaved with SmaI and PstI, to give plasmid pF1a. DNA sequence analysis of pF1a revealed that it contained a truncated ORF. To obtain a full-length clone, a C. albicans fosmid library was screened with a pF1a subfragment as probe, yielding five positive fosmids (B. Magee, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN). A 3.2-kb BglII fosmid fragment hybridizing with the probe was further subcloned into plasmid YEp352 at the BamHI site, yielding plasmid FosBgl. Sequencing of theCAP1 gene was performed on both DNA strands of the entire 3.2-kb BglII genomic DNA fragment with custom synthesized oligonucleotides, using the automated sequencing facilities of the Sheldon Biotechnology Center (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Sequence analyses were performed using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group programs (58Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The FosBgl and pF1a plasmids were used throughout this study for expression of the full-length and truncated versions of the CAP1 gene and were renamed YEp352/CAP1 and YEp352/CAP1-TR, respectively. A 2.5-kb DNA fragment overlapping the entire YAP1 gene (positions −349 to +2129 with respect to the initiation codon) (25Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using S. cerevisiae genomic DNA as template, the high-fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and oligonucleotides 5′-CGGATTCTAGCTGTTTGGTTGAT and 5′-CGGAATTCATACATAGTCTA. The resulting PCR fragment was gel-purified and cloned blunt into YEp352 cut with SmaI, to generate plasmid YEp352/YAP1. For microtiter plate assays, cells grown for 48 h on selective SD −ura were resuspended in a saline solution (0.85%) to an A 600 of 0.1. These cells were then diluted 100-fold in SD −ura. The diluted cell suspensions were added to round-bottom 96-well microtiter plates (50 μl/well; in duplicate) in wells containing equal volumes (50 μl) of medium with different concentrations of the drug tested or in drug-free medium. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. Cell growth was evaluated by reading the optical density at 650 nm in a microplate reader (Vmax™, Molecular Devices). The relative growth was calculated as the percentage of growth in drug-containing medium relative to the control growth in drug-free medium. The chosen concentrations were 50 μg/ml for FCZ, 0.1 μg/ml for CYH, and 1 μm for 4-NQO, which correspond to the minimal inhibitory concentration of these drugs for wild-type strain MRY13–1A transformed with control plasmid YEp352. For the cadmium resistance spot assay, transformants were grown overnight in SD −ura medium and approximately 104 cells were spotted onto a YPD plate containing 0 or 10 μmcadmium. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. Resistance to hydrogen peroxide was tested essentially as described (35Stephen D.W. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, transformants were grown to saturation in SD −ura medium and approximately 106 cells were spread on YPD plates. A filter paper disc was placed in the center of each plate, 10 μl of hydrogen peroxide (30% w/v; Aldrich) was added to the disc and the plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C before measuring the diameter of the zones of growth inhibition. W303 cells transformed with plasmids YEp352, YEp352/CAP1, or YEp352/CAP1-TR were grown in SD −ura medium to an A 600 of 2.0. Total RNA was extracted using the glass bead extraction method (59Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). RNA samples (20 μg) were electrophoresed on a 7.5% formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel and transferred by capillarity to a Zeta-Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario). Detection of specific RNAs was performed by hybridization at 65 °C in 0.5 mNaPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA with32P-labeled DNA probes (60Srikantha T. Soll D.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 131: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The CAP1 probe was a 614-bp XbaI-HincII DNA fragment (positions +47 to +661) isolated from clone pF1a. The PDR5 probe was generated by PCR with primers 5′-CATACAGAAGCTCGAATC and 5′-CCACAGTTGACTGATAGG and overlaps region +111 to +447 of thePDR5 gene (positions are relative to the translation initiation codon) (10Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2206-2214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The YBR008c probe, which overlaps a region from −2 to +579 of the YBR008c ORF (GenBank Z35877), was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-TGGTATACACTTCAACGT and 5′-TGTTATGCACAGTAGCAC. A LEU2 probe, consisting of a 0.6-kbClaI-EcoRV fragment isolated from plasmid pJJ282, was also used as an internal control to monitor RNA loading and transfer (61Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed twice at 65 °C with a solution containing 40 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and twice with a solution containing 40 mm NaPO4 pH 7.2, 5% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA) and were exposed for 24 h at −80 °C. A 3.0-kb fragment overlapping the YBR008c ORF and its promoter (positions −1146 to +1853; GenBank Z35877) was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-AGAAAACGGTAACAACAA (forward) and 5′-CGAGCTCTGTGTAGACCTTAGATCT (reverse). The PCR fragment was digested with SacI (a SacI site was introduced at the 3′ end of the reverse primer) and cloned into pGEM-7Zf (Promega, Madison, WI) cut with SmaI and SacI, to yield plasmid pGEM7/YBR008. The ybr008c deletion plasmid (pGEM/ybr008cΔ::HIS3) was constructed by replacing a 1.6-kb SpeI-HindIII fragment ofYBR008c (corresponding to positions −316 to +1339 relative to the translation initiation codon) by a 0.9-kbSmaI-PvuII HIS3 fragment isolated from plasmid pJJ215 (61Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A linear 2.3-kbybr008cΔ::HIS3 deletion fragment was excised with EcoRI and SacI and used to transform W303 a/α. His+ transformants were selected and sporulated. Haploid strains MRY13–1A (YBR008c) and MRY13–1B (ybr008cΔ::HIS3) were obtained as meiotic segregants of the heterozygous strain MRY13 (YBR008c/ybr008cΔ::HIS3). These strains were analyzed by Southern blotting to confirm their genotype at the YBR008c locus. An FLR1(YBR008c)-lacZfusion plasmid was constructed using a PCR fragment overlapping the promoter region, the translation initiation codon, as well as a short portion of the coding region of the FLR1 gene (positions −828 to +25). This PCR fragment was generated using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCGGTAGAAGAGTTACGGAA and 5′-CCAAGCTTTGTCTGTACGTTGAAGTGTA, which introduce, respectively, a 5′ BamHI and a 3′HindIII site for directional cloning into YEp368 cleaved with BamHI and HindIII (62Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), generating plasmid YEp368/FLR1. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm that theFLR1 coding region was in frame with the lacZgene. MRY13–1A cells carrying plasmid YEp352, YEp352/YAP1, YEp352/CAP1, or YEp352/CAP1-TR were transformed with YEp368/FLR1. Cotransformants were grown in SD −ura −leu medium to anA 600 of 1.0. Cells were collected by centrifugation, rinsed with water, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) (63Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-356Google Scholar). Cell disruption was achieved by vortexing the resuspended pellets for 2 min in the presence of glass beads. After addition of 0.5 ml of Z buffer, the cellular extracts were centrifuged for 15 min. β-Galactosidase activities were assayed by measuringo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside hydrolysis in the supernatants (63Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-356Google Scholar) and are expressed as nanomoles ofo-nitrophenol formed/min/mg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (64Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Molecular genetic techniques involving the isolation ofC. albicans genes by functional overexpression in S. cerevisiae provide a powerful approach for the study of drug resistance mechanisms. We have used this approach to search forC. albicans genes that mediate resistance to the azole derivative FCZ when overexpressed in S. cerevisiae. Strain W303 was transformed with a YEp352-based C. albicans genomic DNA library (56Boone C. Sdicu A. Laroche M. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6859-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ura+ transformants were pooled and plated on agar plates containing FCZ (500 μg/ml), a concentration that corresponds to 10 × the minimal inhibitory concentration for W303"
https://openalex.org/W1996025078,"The properties of cardiac L-type channels have been well characterized electrophysiologically, and many such studies have demonstrated that the channels are regulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway. However, the subunit composition of native cardiac L-type calcium channels has not been completely defined. Furthermore, a very important question exists regarding the status of the C-terminal domain of the pore-forming α1subunit, as this domain has the potential to be the target of protein kinases but may be truncated as a result of post-translational processing. In the present studies, the α1C and β2 subunits were identified by subunit-specific antibodies after partial purification from heart membranes, or immunoprecipitation from cardiac myocytes. Both the β2and the full-length α1C subunits were found to be expressed and co-localized in intact cardiac myocytes along T-tubule membranes. Using a quantitative antibody binding analysis, we demonstrated that the majority of the α1C subunits in intact cardiac myocytes appear to be full-length. In addition, we observed that adenylyl cyclase is localized in a pattern similar to the channel subunits in cardiac myocytes.

Taken together, our results provide new insights into the structural basis for understanding the regulation of L-type calcium channels by a cAMP-mediated signaling pathway. The regulation of ion channels by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is a common theme in neurobiology. One of the most extensively studied examples involves the cAMP-mediated regulation of the voltage-activated L-type calcium channel in heart. The activation of β-adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine facilitates the opening of cardiac L-type channels and regulates cardiac contractility through a protein kinase A (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; HEK, human embryonic kidney; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AC, adenylyl cyclase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. -mediated phosphorylation of the channels or related proteins (1McDonald T.F.

Med. 1996; 6: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although many electrophysiological studies have centered on this important regulatory pathway, very little is known about the biochemical properties of the rare membrane proteins that comprise the channels and the molecular events that underlie their regulation. Important issues need to be resolved to fully understand the regulatory processes that occur in this prototypical system. An essential first step is to understand the subunit composition of cardiac calcium channels. Most voltage-activated calcium channels are multisubunit complexes composed minimally of pore-forming α1 subunits along with accessory β and α2δ subunits. Earlier studies have demonstrated that purified L-type calcium channels contain an α1 subunit and the universal α2δ subunit (3Chang F.C. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18929-18937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cooper C.L. Vandaele S. Barhanin J. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 509-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, cDNA cloning predicted the α1C isoform to be part of the cardiac calcium channels (5Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). While the α1C cDNA predicts a protein with a molecular mass of 242 kDa (5Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), L-type channel proteins purified from avian and mammalian heart contained α1 subunits of 190–200 kDa (3Chang F.C. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18929-18937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Haase H. Striessnig J. Holtzhauer M. Vetter R. Glossmann H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 207: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recent studies have confirmed the suspicion that the purified proteins were α1C subunits that were truncated at the C terminus (7De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10392-10402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Similar C-terminal truncations have been identified in α1 subunits from skeletal and neuronal L-type channels (8De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10778-10782Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Brawley R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18218-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hell J.W.

Appleyard S.M. Yokoyama C.T. Warner C. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7390-7396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to ascertain if these truncations arise as a result of post-translational modifications or as artifacts of isolation and purification of the channel, since the truncations could have serious consequences for channel function and regulation. For example, the truncated cardiac α1C subunit is not a substrate of PKAin vitro (3Chang F.C. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18929-18937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yoshida A. Takahashi M. Nishimura S. Takeshima H. Kokubun S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), while the full-length protein is a substrate (7De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10392-10402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Yoshida A. Takahashi M. Nishimura S. Takeshima H. Kokubun S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, a truncated α1C subunit has been shown to conduct much larger currents than the full-length protein (13Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an important question is: are the α1Csubunits full-length or truncated proteins in the cardiac myocyte? Another important unanswered question is which β-subunit(s) complex with the α1C to form cardiac L-type channels? This question also directly relates to the mechanism of regulation of the channels by PKA, as several β-isoforms are predicted to be potential substrates of PKA, while others are not. Northern analysis and polymerase chain reaction cloning have indicated that mRNAs for β1b, β2, β3, and β4 subunits are present in cardiac muscle (14Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, no studies have been performed to demonstrate the expression and the distribution of the β subunits at the protein level in myocytes. In addition, the regulation of the L-type channel by PKA appears to be self-limiting as the cAMP-generating adenylyl cyclase that is present in cardiac myocytes appears to be negatively regulated by Ca2+ influx through L-type channels (15Yu H.J. Ma H. Green R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 689-693PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known if the channel subunits and adenylyl cyclase are spatially localized in cardiac myocytes in such a way that the increased Ca2+ resulting from calcium channel activation and/or Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release could cause direct inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase. To address these issues, we used multiple channel-specific antibodies to determine whether the α1C subunit is a full-length or truncated protein in the intact myocyte and to identify its partner β subunit. In addition, we demonstrated the expression and the localization of the calcium channel subunits and adenylyl cyclase in cardiac myocytes. Adult male rabbits were purchased from commercial suppliers.

(1997) Biochemistry, in press. Crude Sf9 cell membranes containing the α1C proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The region on the blots containing the α1C proteins were cut out and incubated with Card I overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the bound antibody was eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5, and rapidly neutralized with 1 m K2HPO4. The specificity of purified Card I was tested using expressed proteins on immunoblots (data not shown). Partial cDNA clones for the type V and VI adenylyl cyclase (AC) were obtained and sequenced after screening a chicken heart library (Stratagene). A generic AC antibody, ACcom, was generated against a chick type VI AC sequence in the C-terminal loop corresponding to amino acids 993–1112 in the dog type VI AC (18Katsushika S. Chen L. Kawabe J. Nilakantan R. Halnon N.J. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8774-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which was identified by sequence alignment using LaserGene to be highly conserved in all ACs. An antibody targeted to type V and VI isozymes, ACV/VI, was generated against a sequence from the 6–7 loop region of the chick type V AC corresponding to amino acids 547–661 in the dog type V AC (19Ishikawa Y. Katsushika S. Chen L. Halnon N.J. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13553-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence is highly conserved between type V and VI isozymes but has low homology with other AC isozymes (identified by LaserGene alignment). To produce fusion proteins for antibody production, the cDNAs encoding the chick type V and type VI sequences noted above were generated by polymerase chain reaction of the partial chick heart clones and subcloned into pGEX-4T3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), resulting in an in-frame fusion of the AC residues to glutathione S-transferase. While both fusion proteins were insoluble, they were purified by SDS-PAGE and electroelution. Briefly, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacteria were resuspended and sonicated in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. The insoluble protein pellet was washed three times in the same buffer to remove soluble proteins, and the final protein pellet was solubilized in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE directly. The insoluble fusion protein was the major protein band on the gel revealed by Coomassie staining (data not shown). The fusion proteins were purified by excision from the gel followed by electroelution into SDS electrophoresis buffer (20Kobayashi M. Hiura N. Matsuda K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 351-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the purified fusion proteins were prepared in goats and rabbits at Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Four antibodies were obtained: rabbit ACcom, goat ACcom, rabbit ACV/VI, and goat ACV/VI (see “Results”). To avoid the background problem caused by secondary antibodies in studies of low abundance proteins when the same antibody is used for immunoblotting after immunoprecipitation, Card I, βgen, and β2antibodies were biotinylated using an ImmunoPure NHS-LC-Biotinylation kit (Pierce) following the standard procedures suggested by the manufacturers. Adult rabbit cardiac myocytes were isolated using previously described procedures (21Haddad J. Decker M.L. Hsieh L.C. Lesch M. Samarel A.M. Decker R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C19-C27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, myocytes were transferred to M199 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) and kept at 37 °C until used. Crude membranes from rabbit heart were prepared as described previously (22Hosey M.M. McMahon K.K. Danckers A.M. O'Callahan C.M. Wong J. Green R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 232: 795-801PubMed Google Scholar) except for the inclusion of protease inhibitors used in Ref. 16Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

For immunoprecipitation, membranes were solubilized in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1%SDS, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (16Chien A.J. Zhao X.

Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and channel subunits were identified by immunoblotting. For channel purification, membranes were prelabeled with (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 (Amersham) after which channel proteins were solubilized and partially purified with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose chromatography (Sigma) as described previously (3Chang F.C. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18929-18937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing the peak of dihydropyridine binding were concentrated, and the protein components of the channel were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Freshly isolated rabbit myocytes were homogenized in buffer A (250 mmsucrose, 0.25 m KCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (16Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E.

The homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were rapidly washed three times with buffer A containing 0.6 mKCl to extract myosin. The pellets were then washed once with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors), and resuspended in buffer B containing 1% SDS. Solubilized proteins were diluted 5-fold in buffer C (buffer B containing 0.8% digitonin, 0.25% cholate, 0.2m NaCl) and immunoprecipitated using Card I and/or the βgen antibodies coupled to immobilized protein G (Pierce). Pellets were washed 5 times in 20 volumes of buffer C containing 0.5 m NaCl. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Channel subunits were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and horseradish peroxidase as described (16Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). When biotinylated antibodies were used for immunoblotting, proteins were visualized using neutroavidin and biotin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). To test the specificity of the AC antibodies, HEK/ACV cells were sonicated in homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors (16Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)) and crude membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, membranes were solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxylcholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) and solubilized proteins were incubated with the indicated AC antibodies immobilized to protein G (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were washed with immunoprecipitation buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Freshly isolated rabbit myocytes were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h in M199 media (Life Technologies, Inc.). Prior to staining, myocytes were washed twice with relaxation buffer (0.1 m KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 6.8), followed by fixing in pre-cooled (−20 °C) methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5–10 min at 4 °C. Fixed myocytes were incubated overnight in labeling buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum in PBS) to block nonspecific binding. Different primary antibodies were diluted in labeling buffer and incubated with myocytes overnight at 4 °C. In the cases of double labeling, two primary antibodies were used simultaneously. Different mixtures of secondary antibodies were used subsequently, including: FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG, FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Coverslips were mounted onto slides and viewed on a scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). For all the channel and AC antibodies, negative control experiments were performed using preimmune antibody, secondary antibody alone, and/or antigen-preabsorbed antibody; in each case we observed no specific staining (data not shown). Transient expression of different calcium channel subunits in HEK293 cells has been described previously (16Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 17Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As will be described below, it was of interest to determine the relative binding efficiencies of different antibodies to recognize the same proteins. Specifically, we designed experiments to allow comparison of recognition of the α1C subunit by Card Iversus Card C. To do this we used heterologously expressed channel subunits as the standards. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the α1C, β2a, and the α2δ subunits (16Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Cells were split into poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates and were fixed ∼48 h post-transfection using the method described above for immunofluorescence studies. Cells were then incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1–2 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with the indicated primary antibodies at 4 °C. After washing out unbound primary antibodies, 125I-labeled protein G (NEN Life Sciences Products) was incubated with the cells for 2–4 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBS, bound radioactivity was eluted from the plates using 2% SDS and quantified using a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding from primary antibodies was determined after preabsorbing antibodies with their immunizing antigens. To identify which components comprise the cardiac calcium channels, we partially purified the L-type calcium channels from rabbit heart using WGA-Sepharose chromatography. Cardiac membranes were prelabeled with the dihydropyridine ligand (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 (3Chang F.C. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18929-18937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purification was followed by the specific binding (Fig.1 A). Fractions enriched in binding were analyzed with the α1C subunit specific antibody Card I (Fig. 1 B). The major component recognized by Card I, which is directed against an internal domain of the α1C subunit (16Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was a diffuse protein migrating at ∼200 kDa (Fig. 1 B). This is likely to be the truncated form of the α1C subunit of the L-type calcium channel (3Chang F.C. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18929-18937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10392-10402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The fractions enriched in PN 200-110 binding were pooled and analyzed for reactivity with Card C, which is directed against the C-terminal region of the α1C subunit (16Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Card C will only detect full-length α1C and not react with a C-terminal truncated protein. The Card C antibody recognized a protein migrating at 240 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane 2), that migrated similarly to Sf9 cell expressed α1C subunit (Fig.1 C, lane 1) which was included as a positive control, since previous studies showed that this heterologously expressed α1C subunit is a full-length protein with intact N and C termini (16Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).2 Card I, which will recognize the full-length and C-terminal truncated protein, recognized essentially only the smaller 190–200-kDa protein (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). The lack of significant staining at the 240-kDa position with this antibody suggested that most of the α1C subunit in the partially purified preparation is truncated at its C terminus. The stronger staining of the full-length α1C subunit by Card Cversus Card I reflected the greater sensitivity of the Card C antibody to detect denatured α1C proteins on Western blots (this was also observed using the Sf9 full-length α1C as a standard). To detect which β subunit co-purified with the α1Csubunit, we stained the pooled WGA-Sepharose eluates with β subunit-specific antibodies. In the same fractions that contained α1C, a diffuse protein of 68–70 kDa was specifically immunostained by the β2-specific antibody (Fig. 1 C, lane 6), and exhibited mobility similar to the heterologously expressed β2a subunit from Sf9 cells that was run as a control (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). Taken together, the results from the WGA-Sepharose purification suggest that α1C and β2 subunits are likely components of cardiac L-type calcium channels. To begin to address whether the truncated α1C subunit is an artifact of isolation or a physiological component of the channels, we sought to minimize possible proteolysis during the isolation procedure by using cardiac myocytes. In addition, since heart is a heterogeneous tissue, studies with the cardiac myocytes were performed to ensure that the α1C and β2 subunits were indeed expressed in cardiac myocytes versus other cell types (e.g. smooth muscle) that are present in whole heart preparations. Crude membranes were quickly prepared from freshly isolated myocytes, solubilized in 1% SDS, and directly subjected to immunoprecipitation with a mixture of the Card I and βgen(a generic β subunit antibody (17Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)) antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed for α1C content by immunoblotting with either Card C or biotinylated-Card I (Bio-I). A 240-kDa protein was detected by Card C in the immunoprecipitates, which corresponded to the full-length α1C subunit with an intact C terminus (Fig.2 A, lane 1). On the other hand, a major component of ∼200 kDa and a trace of the 240-kDa component corresponding to the truncated and the full-length forms of the α1C subunit, respectively, were identified by Bio-I in the immunoprecipitates. Despite the fact that multiple protease inhibitors were used, the majority of the α1C subunit was truncated at the C terminus. The immunostained proteins migrated over a broad range, suggesting the presence of multiple proteolytic products that might arise as a result of proteolytic breakdown that occurs during isolation of the protein. The immunoprecipitates from myocytes were also analyzed for the β2 subunit. The same 68–70-kDa proteins discussed earlier were immunoprecipitated by the βgen antibody from myocytes and were identified by subsequent immunoblotting with the β2 antibody (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). In addition, blotting of the immunoprecipitates with biotinylated-βgen(Bio-βgen) resulted in staining of the same proteins (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Thus the β2 subunit is present in cardiac myocytes. We asked whether any other β subunits could be identified from heart by the βgen antibody (17Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we ran heterologously expressed β1b, β2a, β3, and β4 subunits, which were readily detected by Bio-βgen (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–6). However, the only immunoreactive protein detected in the immunoprecipitates from rabbit heart membranes by Bio-βgen was the same as that detected by the β2 antibody (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and2). These results suggested that β2 is the major cardiac isoform of the β subunit as detected by our antibodies. L-type calcium channels have been localized to the T-tubular system in skeletal muscle (23Fosset M. Jaimovich E. Delpont E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6086-6092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Franzini-Armstrong C. Jorgensen A.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), but only very limited information is available concerning their distribution in mammalian cardiac muscle. We investigated the subcellular localization of the β2 and α1C subunits in cardiac myocytes using immunofluorescence staining. Previous studies have demonstrated that the T-tubule network is closely apposed to the Z-lines in ventricular myocytes (25Forbes M.S. Sperelakis N. Tissue & Cell. 1980; 12: 467-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Carl S.L. Felix K. Caswell A.H. Brandt Jr., N.R. Vaghy P.L. Meissner G. Ferguson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). An anti-α-actinin antibody was used to label the Z-lines in intact myocytes (27Simpson D.G. Decker M.L. Clark W.A. Decker R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), to obtain an indication of T-tubule localization. To reveal the distribution of the β2 subunit, freshly isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes were co-stained with the β2 and the anti-α-actinin antibodies, and visualized using FITC- and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively (Fig. 3, A-C). The staining pattern for both the β2 subunits and α-actinin were observed as regularly-spaced and evenly-distributed transverse bands (Fig. 3, A and B). To further determine whether the β2 subunit is expressed on T-tubules, two confocal images obtained from the same section of the myocyte (Fig. 3,A and B) were overlaid using Adobe software (Fig.3 C). The predominant yellow color in the merged image indicated that the β2 subunit and α-actinin are closely associated. The most reasonable interpretation of these data is that the β2 subunit is localized along T-tubule membranes in cardiac myocytes. To corroborate these findings, we used the βgen and the anti-α-actinin antibodies to co-label the myocytes; similar striated staining associated with the T-tubules was also observed (data not shown). These results provided the first dem"

We isolated a cDNA coding for the central, α-helical region of human p150Glued, a prominent component of the dynactin complex. The interaction between HsEg5 and p150Glued was enhanced upon activation of p34CDC28, the budding yeast homolog of p34cdc2, provided that HsEg5 had a phosphorylatable residue at position 927. Phosphorylation also enhanced the specific binding of p150Glued to the tail domain of HsEg5 in vitro, indicating that the two proteins are able to interact directly. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed co-localization of HsEg5 and p150Glued during mitosis but not during interphase, consistent with a cell cycle-dependent association between the two proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that HsEg5 and p150Glued may interact in mammalian cells in vivo and that p34cdc2 may regulate this interaction.

Kinesin function also requires accessory proteins, both in vivo andin vitro. One prominent protein interacting with kinesin, termed kinectin (32Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J.

Prominent among the KRPs implicated in different aspects of mitotic spindle assembly and function are the BimC family members (reviewed in Refs. 3Barton N.R. Goldstein L.S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that HsEg5 associates with centrosomes in early prophase (43Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), and data obtained for both XlEg5 and HsEg5 indicate that this event depends on phosphorylation of tail residue threonine 927 (Thr-927) by p34cdc2/cyclin B (43Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 44Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Prompted by these findings, we have now used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that would interact with the HsEg5 tail domain. We report that the HsEg5 tail interacts specifically with the human homolog of the dynactin component p150Glued. Moreover, we present evidence that this interaction is enhanced by phosphorylation of residue Thr-927 of HsEg5, both in yeast cells in vivo and in vitro. These provocative results have implications not only for the function of HsEg5, but they also provide a new perspective on the role of the dynactin complex. A cDNA encoding the stalk and tail domains of HsEg5 (Eg5ST) was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) by inserting a NdeI-SalI fragment of the original HsEg5 cDNA (43Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) into plasmid pAS2 digested withNdeI-SalI (45Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar). Similarly, for fusion of Eg5ST to the GAL4 activation domain (AD), a (NdeI)-EcoRI fragment excised from the HsEg5 cDNA was inserted into plasmid pACT2 digested with SmaI and EcoRI (45Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar). (Some restriction enzymes are marked in parentheses to indicate that, before ligation, Klenow polymerase was used to blunt end 5′-protruding DNA fragments). The HsEg5 tail domain (Eg5T) was fused to GAL4 AD by inserting a HincII-BamHI fragment of the cDNA into plasmid pACT2 digested with (NcoI) andBamHI. The resulting constructs, Eg5ST and Eg5T, thus comprise the C-terminal moieties of HsEg5 starting at residues 245 and 764, respectively. For control, the Nek2 protein kinase (46Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sütterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar) was fused to GAL4 DBD by inserting a (NaeI)-(XbaI) fragment excised from the full-length cDNA into pAS2 digested withSmaI. Nek2 was also fused to GAL4 AD by inserting aNcoI-BamHI fragment into pACT2 digested withNcoI-BamHI. The HsGlu-1 cDNA isolated in the course of the two-hybrid screen was fused to an Myc epitope tag by inserting an EcoRI-BglII fragment into plasmid pBSmyc digested with EcoRI and BglII (47Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The whole HsEg5 sequence was fused to the GST protein by inserting theEcoRI fragment of the cDNA into plasmid pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed essentially as described (45Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar, 48Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast strain Y190 expressing the fusion protein DBD-Eg5ST was transformed with a human cDNA library constructed in plasmid pACT (48Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) and plated on selective medium (lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine) supplemented with 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. From 4 × 106 transformants, 141 His+ colonies were obtained and assayed for LacZ expression. After being cured from the bait plasmid, the resulting 50 positive colonies were mated with Y187 yeast strains expressing DBD-Eg5ST, -cdc2, -cdk2 or -lamin fusion proteins. Seventeen colonies showed a strong specific interaction with DBD-Eg5ST only. Of 11 colonies without rearrangements in the initial pACT1 vector, two contained the same insert, termed HsGlu-1. Specific interactions between HsGlu-1 plasmids and the DBD-Eg5ST bait were also observed when both plasmids were retransformed into Y190 yeast cells. For β-galactosidase activity assays on filters, yeast colonies were replica-plated onto nitrocellulose filters, and these were frozen for 20 s in liquid nitrogen. Then they were placed onto a Whatman No. 3MM paper soaked with Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7) containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mg/ml) and incubated at 30 °C. For β-galactosidase liquid assays, 10 ml of mid-log phase yeast cultures (A 600 ∼ 0.5) were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of Z buffer. Cells were lysed by the addition of 100 μl of CHCl3 and 100 μl of 0.1% SDS, followed by a 20-s vortex. After equilibration at 30 °C in a water bath, 0.2 ml of a 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside substrate solution was added. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1 mNa2CO3. The β-galactosidase activity was then estimated by measuring the absorbance at 420 nm, and units of activity were calculated using the expression, 1000 ×A 420)/(t × v ×A 600), where t is the reaction time in minutes and v is the volume of the culture in ml. For nocodazole arrest, yeasts were grown to mid-log phase. Then cultures were supplemented with 1% Me2SO and 15 μg/ml nocodazole, and incubation was extended for another 90 min. β-Galactosidase activity was then measured as described above. The cell cycle stages of the cultures were determined by microscopic observation of budding. Myc-tagged proteins were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates according to manufacturer instructions (Promega). For in vitrointeraction assays, 100 ng of GST or MalE fusion proteins, purified according to manufacturer instructions (Pharmacia and New England Biolabs, Inc.), were mixed with 10 μl of in vitrotranslation reactions, and volumes were adjusted to 100 μl with immunoprecipitation buffer (0.25% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Samples were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C before 5 μl of monoclonal 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (49Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) adsorbed to protein G-Sepharose beads were added. After a 60-min incubation at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, beads were rinsed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, boiled in loading buffer, and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting was then performed as described, using anti-MalEg5T serum (43Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). For in vitrophosphorylation of MalEg5T, 10 μg of purified protein (43Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 μl of p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase (New England Biolabs) in a total volume of 100 μl according to manufacturer instructions. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, one-hundredth of the sample (i.e. 100 ng of phosphorylated MalEg5T protein) was incubated with in vitro translation products. HeLa cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and grown for 24 h as described previously (50Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in PBS and permeabilized by a 30-s treatment with acetone at −20 C°. For co-staining of HsEg5 and p150Glued, coverslips were first incubated for 1 h with a mixture of rabbit anti-HsEg5 antibody (Eg5+, 2 μg/ml) (43Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) and a mouse anti-p150Glued antibody (2 μg/ml; Transduction Laboratories) in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. After several washes in PBS, coverslips were incubated for 45 min with a biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:50 in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin; Amersham Corp.), washed again, and finally incubated for 45 min with a mixture of Texas red-conjugated streptavidin (1:200, Amersham Corp.), a 5-([4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl]amino)fluorescein (DTAF)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500, Pierce), and Hoechst 33258 (0.5 μg/ml, Calbiochem-Novabiochem) in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were mounted in 80% glycerol, 3%n-propyl gallate in PBS, and cells were viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope using a 63 × oil immersion objective. To identify cellular proteins that might interact with HsEg5, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed (51Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar, 52Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 331-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since KRP function may often require oligomerization (53Cole D.G. Chinn S.W. Wedaman K.P. Hall K. Vuong T. Scholey J.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 54Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A.

Nature. 1996; 379: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), we considered it important to use a bait protein that would be able to oligomerize in yeast. Overexpression of the full-length HsEg5 protein in S. cerevisiae was toxic; thus, the motor domain was deleted from HsEg5, and the remaining stalk-tail moiety (termed Eg5ST) was fused to either the DBD or the AD of GAL4. Coexpression of DBD-Eg5ST and AD-Eg5ST in yeast activated thelacZ reporter gene (48Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), indicating that these two fusion proteins were able to interact (Fig. 1 A). Deletion of the stalk domain from one of the two proteins (shown for the pair DBD-Eg5ST and AD-Eg5T) or coexpression of Eg5ST constructs with control fusion proteins (AD-Nek2 and DBD-Nek2) did not result in any interaction (Fig. 1 A). These data show that HsEg5 fusion proteins can oligomerize in yeast provided that they contain stalk domains. Using the DBD-Eg5ST construct as bait, a human cDNA library was screened (48Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), and library clones able to activate both the selection marker His3 and the lacZ reporter gene specifically in the presence of DBD-Eg5ST were selected. Among the clones showing a specific interaction with Eg5ST, two were identical and contained a 1179-base pair cDNA insert. Data base searches revealed that the corresponding translation product was closely related to a fragment of the rat p150Glued protein (10Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1639-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Holzbaur E.L.F. Hammarback J.A. Paschal B.M. Kravit N.G. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1991; 351: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); hence, this cDNA was termed HsGlu-1. As shown in Fig. 1 B, AD-Glu-1 activated the lacZ reporter gene specifically in the presence of DBD-Eg5ST but not in the presence of unrelated bait constructs (DBD-cdc2, DBD-cdk2, or DBD-lamin). An alignment between HsGlu-1 and the central α-helical domain (encompassing residues 420–811) of rat p150Glued is shown in Fig. 1 C. Over this region, the two proteins display 97% identity, indicating that HsGlu-1 almost certainly represents part of the human homolog of rat p150Glued. Fig. 1 D shows a schematic view of p150Glued and indicates the regions identified as potential interaction domains for HsEg5 (this study) and the intermediate chain of dynein (17Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1634-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 57Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). There is potentially a partial overlap between these two putative binding sites, but it is noteworthy that the HsEg5 interaction site falls outside of the predicted coiled coil domain of p150Glued. As shown previously, phosphorylation of tail residue Thr-927 by the p34cdc2 protein kinase promotes the association of HsEg5 with early prophase centrosomes (43Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction between Eg5ST and HsGlu-1 observed in yeast might be favored by phosphorylation of Thr-927, DBD-Eg5ST mutants containing an alanine, serine, or aspartic acid in place of Thr-927 were constructed. These mutants were then coexpressed in yeast together with AD-Glu-1, and protein extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase activities. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the average β-galactosidase activity was higher in yeasts expressing either the wild-type (T) or the serine mutant (S) of Eg5ST than in yeasts expressing the corresponding alanine (A) or aspartic acid (D) mutants. These data indicate that the interaction between Eg5ST and HsGlu-1 is reduced by the mutation of Thr-927 to a nonphosphorylatable residue (alanine or aspartic acid) but not by a mutation to another phosphorylatable residue (serine). It is noteworthy that the replacement of threonine 927 by aspartic acid did not enhance binding of Eg5ST to HsGlu-1, suggesting that the additional negative charge introduced by this substitution cannot mimic phosphorylation of HsEg5. This result is entirely consistent with our previous finding that a T927D mutation did not confer constitutive centrosomal association to HsEg5 in vivo (43Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing yeast populations contain only a small proportion of cells in G2 and M phase (approximately 20%). Therefore, the extent of phosphorylation of the Eg5ST bait proteins by p34CDC28 protein kinase is expected to be low, and it is not surprising that analyses of exponentially growing cells revealed only a modest influence of the identity of residue 927 on the interaction with HsGlu-1 (Fig. 2 A). However, considering that p34CDC28 protein kinase is maximally active during mitosis, we predicted that binding of wild-type Eg5ST to HsGlu-1 should be substantially increased in mitotically arrested cells, whereas binding of the alanine mutant should not be enhanced. Indeed, compared with exponentially growing cells (20% in G2 or M), β-galactosidase activity was doubled when yeast cells expressing wild-type Eg5ST were blocked in mitosis with nocodazole (80% in G2 or M) but was almost unchanged in the case of the alanine mutant (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that phosphorylation of Thr-927 by p34CDC28 enhances the interaction between Eg5ST and HsGlu-1, and this in turn implies that HsGlu-1 most probably binds to the tail region of the motor. To determine whether HsEg5 and p150Glued interact directly, in vitro binding studies were performed. For this purpose, the entire HsEg5 protein was fused to GST (GST-Eg5), and the tail domain was fused to the MalE protein (MalEg5). Both fusion proteins were overexpressed inEscherichia coli and purified. The HsGlu-1 cDNA was Myc-tagged (myc-Gl1), and the corresponding RNA was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. For control, a second protein isolated during the two-hybrid screen, and thus potentially interacting with HsEg5, was also tagged (myc-Q2) and translated. In a first experiment (Fig. 3 A), myc-Gl1 (lane 1) and myc-Q2 (lane 2) translation products, as well as control reticulocyte lysate (lane 3), were incubated with GST-Eg5 protein; then immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-Myc antibodies, and the isolated complexes were probed by immunoblotting with anti-Eg5 antibodies. Efficient immunoprecipitation of the GST-Eg5 fusion protein by anti-Myc antibodies was observed only in the sample in which myc-Gl1 protein was present (Fig. 3 A, comparelane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). These results show that an interaction between HsGlu-1 and HsEg5 occurs not only in yeast cells in vivo, but also in vitro, implying that HsGlu-1 is able to bind directly to HsEg5. In contrast, when tested under identical conditions, the protein encoded byQ2 did not bind to HsEg5 in vitro, suggesting that its isolation in the yeast two-hybrid screen may have been the result of an indirect interaction. To rule out a role of the GST moiety in binding to HsGlu-1 and to determine more precisely which part of HsEg5 interacted with HsGlu-1, a similar type of experiment was performed with MalEg5T using MalE protein for control. Moreover, prompted by the finding that phosphorylation of Thr-927 promotes the interaction of HsEg5 with the spindle apparatus in vivo (43Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) and the interaction with HsGlu-1 in yeast cells (Fig. 2), we examined the influence of prior phosphorylation of the MalEg5T fusion protein by recombinant p34cdc2/cyclin B on its ability to interact with myc-Gl1in vitro. In the presence of the myc-Gl1 translation product, anti-Myc antibodies efficiently precipitated the MalEg5T fusion protein"

The STAT factors are assembled to form the specific transcription complexes ISGF3 (for interferon-stimulatedgene factor 3) for IFN-α/β and GAF (for IFN-γactivation factor) for IFN-γ. These transcription factors act at differentcis-acting DNA elements termed the IFN-stimulated responsive element for ISGF3 and the IFN-γ activation site for GAF and are located in the promoter region of IFN-induced genes (12Levy D.E.

The diverse biological actions of IFNs are thought to be mediated by the products of specific but usually overlapping sets of cellular genes induced in the target cells. More recently, some interferon-induced proteins have been located within discrete nuclear structures termed nuclear bodies (19Korioth F. Gieffers C. Maul G.G. Frey J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Grotzinger T. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. Eur. J.

Previously defined by electron microscopy as dense 0.3–0.5-nm diameter spherical particles, the nuclear bodies, so-called PML (for promyelocyticleukemia protein) nuclear bodies (PML NBs), appear characteristic of large multiprotein complexes associated with the nuclear matrix (23Ascoli C.A.

These structures are distinct from other well described subnuclear domains such as the nucleolus, the interchromatin granules, the perichromatin fibrils, and the coiled bodies (for review, see Ref. 29Spector D.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 265-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Among the PML NB-associated proteins, PML is the best documented. PML was originally discovered as a fusion protein with retinoic acid receptor-α in malignant hematopoietic cells with a t(15:17) translocation characteristic for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (reviewed in Refs. 30Warrell Jr., R.P. de The H.

A tumor cell growth suppressor function and a role in human oncogenesis were reported for PML (33Mu Z.M. Chin K.V. Liu J.H. Lozano G. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell.

Degos L. Calvo F. de The H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1315-1324PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to PML, the nuclear bodies include at least two other IFN-induced proteins, NDP52 (for nucleardot protein 52) (19Korioth F. Gieffers C. Maul G.G. Frey J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and the SP100 protein, originally identified as an autoantigen in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (20Grotzinger T. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Szostecki C. Guldner H.H. Netter H.J. Will H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4338-4347PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the number and morphology of PML NBs are variable, particularly throughout the cell cycle and in some pathological contexts. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, PML NBs are disrupted into a microparticulate pattern as a consequence of the expression of the PML-retinoic acid receptor-α oncoprotein. Retinoic acid treatment triggers a reorganization of the nucleus to generate normal appearing PML NBs, which in turn is linked to differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (26Weis K. Rambaud S. Lavau C. Jansen J. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A. Dejean A. Cell. 1994; 76: 345-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 27Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller Jr., W.H.

Although the function of PML NBs is still unknown, some observations suggest that they may represent preferential targets for viral infection and thus could play a role in the mechanism of antiviral action of IFNs. In particular, after adenovirus infection, the viral E4-ORF3 protein is targeted to PML NBs and causes their reorganization from spherical to fibrous structures (37Carvalho T. Seeler J.S. Ohman K. Jordan P. Pettersson U. Akusjarvi G. Carmo-Fonseca M. Dejean A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 38Doucas V. Ishov A.M. Romo A. Juguilon H. Weitzman M.D. Evans R.M. Maul G.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax oncoprotein induces a diffuse cytoplasmic redistribution of the Int-6 protein, which normally colocalizes with PML in the absence of Tax expression (39Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This delocalization appears to be specific for Int-6 because Tax does not alter the global speckled staining pattern of PML. The herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early protein Vmw110 (ICPO), which is implicated in the control of reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus type 1, transiently colocalizes after viral infection to PML NBs and subsequently disrupts these structures (40Maul G.G. Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 41Everett R.D. Maul G.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5062-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In the same way, PML NBs are reorganized after human cytomegalovirus infection (42Kelly C. van Driel R. Wilkinson G.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2887-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 43Korioth F. Maul G. Platcher B. Ttamminger T. Frey J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA-5 (44Szekely L. Pokrovskaja K. Jiang W.Q. de The H. Ringertz N. Klein G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2562-2568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the adenovirus E1A protein, and the SV40 large T antigen (37Carvalho T. Seeler J.S. Ohman K. Jordan P. Pettersson U. Akusjarvi G. Carmo-Fonseca M. Dejean A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), other viral members of the oncoprotein family, are also found in close association with PML NBs. These observations, coupled with the fact that the PML, SP100, and NDP52 proteins are all induced by IFN (19Korioth F. Gieffers C. Maul G.G. Frey J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Grotzinger T. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. Eur. J.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2565-2573PubMed Google Scholar), have suggested that PML NBs may play a role in the viral infection process. The elucidation of the actual role of PML NBs in the cell and their implication in the mechanism of action of IFN will be through the identification of new PML NB-associated proteins and the characterization of their behavior under physiological stimuli. We have therefore established a cDNA library from IFN-treated Daudi cells and made use of differential screening to search for as yet unidentified IFN-regulated genes (45Tissot C. Mechti N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14891-14898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the course of this study, we have isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel protein that shares strong similarity with the nuclear Xenopus protein XPMC2 (46Su J.Y. Maller J.L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This new gene will be referred to as ISG20 for interferon-stimulated gene product of 20 kDa. Using laser confocal immunofluorescence analysis, we demonstrate that ISG20 protein is closely associated with PML and SP100 in the newly described nuclear structures termed PML NBs. Human lymphoblastoid Daudi cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Hamster fibroblast (CCL39), SV40-transformed monkey kidney epithelial (COS-7m6), human hepatocarcinoma (CCL13), and human HeLa cells were grown in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. For IFN induction, exponentially growing cells were exposed for 16 h to 500 IU/ml human lymphoblastoid IFN (HuIFN-α/β; obtained from Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories Inc.) or 500 units/ml IFN-γ (a gift of Roussel-UCLAF, Paris, France). For the generation of anti-PML and anti-SP100 antibodies, a PML cDNA NcoI-SmaI fragment (positions 80–1421 in the cDNA sequence) and the full-length coding region of SP100 cDNA were inserted into a glutathione S-transferase gene fusion vector to generate GST-PML and GST-SP100 hybrid proteins. Recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns and were used for rabbit immunizations. For RNA purification, the cells were pelleted and washed in phosphate-buffer saline, and total mRNAs were isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate method as described previously (47Mechti N. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Jeanteur P. Lebleu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2832-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RNAs were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 10% (v/v) formaldehyde-containing 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.). The multiple-tissue Northern blot membrane (CLONTECH) was a gift of Dr. P. Fort. Prehybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 12 h in a mixture containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, and 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. An additional 12-h hybridization was performed in the presence of 106 cpm/ml32P-labeled random-primed cDNA probe. Stringent washings were then conducted at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC (0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) before autoradiography. For run-on experiments, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer in 10 volumes of 0.25 msucrose containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were purified through a sucrose cushion as described previously (48Mechti N. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Marty L. Bonnieu A. Jeanteur P. Lebleu B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9653-9666Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNAs were isolated from total mRNAs using the Dynabeads biomagnetic separation system (Biosys S. A.), and the cDNA library was constructed in the λZAP cDNA synthesis system (Stratagene). The library was plated at low density to obtain individual plaques and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N). A single round of screening was performed by successive hybridization of a single filter using 32P-labeled cDNA probes (2 × 106 cpm/ml) obtained from poly(A+) RNAs of untreated or IFN-treated Daudi cells. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing of the filter were performed as described for Northern blot analysis. Clones exhibiting a variation in signal intensity were isolated, and the pBluescript phagemid vectors containing inserts were excised using the ExAssit-SORL system (Stratagene). Phagemid DNAs were then extracted and used to probe Northern blot membranes. Plasmid DNAs of individual clones were prepared, and their sequences were determined by the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method (T7 sequencing kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The complete sequence ofISG20 cDNA was obtained on both strands by overlapping sequenced fragments of the original clone after subcloning in the pBluescript II KS vector. Searches for sequence homologies in the EMBL and GenBank™ Data Banks as well as sequence analyses were performed by using the BISANCE facilities (49Densen P. Fondrat C. Valencien C. Mugnier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1980; 6: 355-356Google Scholar). CCL13, CCL39, and COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method for CCL13 and by the LipofectAMINE procedure (as outlined by Life Technologies, Inc.) for CCL39 and COS cells. Cells were grown as monolayers on glass coverslips in 35-mm Petri dishes containing 2 ml of culture medium and transfected with 2.5 μg of expression vector DNA and 2.5 μg of carrier pSG5 plasmid. 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced by fresh culture medium, and the cells were further incubated for 24 h. Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (26Weis K. Rambaud S. Lavau C. Jansen J. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A. Dejean A. Cell. 1994; 76: 345-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) with anti-PML or anti-SP100 polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1:200) and with the 12CA5 anti-HA monoclonal antibody (15 ng/μl). Slides were viewed using a Leica confocal microscope. Image files were processed with the Adobe Photoshop program. Total RNAs were extracted from human lymphoblastoid Daudi cells treated for 16 h with 500 IU of HuIFN-α/β. An oriented cDNA library was constructed using the Stratagene λZAP cDNA synthesis kit. 5000 primary recombinant clones were screened successively with single-stranded32P-labeled cDNA derived from exponentially growing untreated cells and with cDNA from IFN-treated cells. Spots exhibiting a variation in signal intensity were selected, and pBluescript phagemid vectors containing inserts were excised using the Stratagene ExAssit-SORL system. DNAs were prepared and used to probe a Northern blot containing total RNA extracted from Daudi cells treated for various times with HuIFN-α/β. Clones exhibiting differential expression upon Northern blot analysis by comparison with an invariant glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (50Fort P. Rech J. Vie A. Piechaczyk M. Bonnieu A. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5657-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) probe were selected. Complete sequence examination of positive clones revealed that one that contains a 694-nucleotide insert encoded a new IFN-induced mRNA, which will be referred to asISG20. The kinetics of expression of the RNA hybridizing to theISG20 cDNA probe was analyzed by probing a Northern blot of total RNAs isolated from Daudi cells treated for various times with HuIFN-α/β. As shown in Fig. 1 A, theISG20 mRNA accumulated rapidly after the onset of IFN treatment. An 8-fold increase in its steady-state level was reached after 16 h of exposure to IFN. Hybridization to a GAPDHprobe used as an invariant control confirmed that each lane of the blot contained an equal amount of total RNA (Fig. 1 A).ISG20 participates in the primary response of IFN action since this induction was not dependent on continuous protein (data not shown). The specificity of induction of the ISG20 mRNA in response to treatment with the various types of IFN was then analyzed. As Daudi cells failed to respond to HuIFN-γ due to the lack of functional receptors, HeLa cells were treated with 500 units/ml HuIFN-α/β or HuIFN-γ, and total RNAs were extracted and analyzed as described above. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the kinetics of induction of ISG20 mRNA was found to be similar with the two types of IFN, although HuIFN-α/β was found to be a stronger inducer. To determine whether the modulation of ISG20 occurs at the transcriptional level, nuclear run-on assays were conducted with nuclei purified from Daudi cells treated or not with HuIFN-α/β as described previously (48Mechti N. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Marty L. Bonnieu A. Jeanteur P. Lebleu B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9653-9666Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The labeled RNAs were hybridized with filters containing ISG20, GAPDH, and pBluescript II KS vector probes. GAPDH and the pBluescript II KS vector were used as invariant and negative controls, respectively. The data presented Fig.1 C clearly demonstrate that the increase in ISG20expression by IFN occurs at the transcriptional level, in keeping with the mechanism of induction of the majority of IFN-induced genes. To determine the tissue specificity of ISG20 expression, the 694-nucleotide insert was used to probe a set of RNAs isolated from several tissues (multiple-tissue Northern blot membrane fromCLONTECH). As shown in Fig. 2,ISG20 is strongly expressed, in the absence of exogenous IFN treatment, in peripheral blood leukocytes, in lymphoid tissues (such as spleen or thymus), and in colon and lung. Various basal levels were detected in other tissues. The same blots were stripped and rehybridized with the control β-actin provided by the manufacturer as an invariant control. To investigate the function of ISG20, the nucleotide sequence of the 694-nucleotide ISG20 cDNA fragment was determined. A single open reading frame (ORF) of 537 nucleotides was identified (Fig.3). The ISG20 ORF predicts a gene product (gpISG20) of 179 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 20.4 kDa. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed a very basic protein with 7 lysine and 19 arginine residues (Lys + Arg = 14.5% of total residues) and a pI of 9.2. Using algorithms to predict the presence of α-helices (51Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) and coiled-coil structures (52Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar), region 78–107 of gpISG20 is strongly predicted to form a coiled-coil domain (Fig. 3). This structural domain is known to mediate protein-protein interactions (for review, see Ref. 53Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), suggesting that ISG20 can act as a component of a multiprotein complex; this important point will be discussed later on the basis of the subcellular localization of ISG20 protein. The coiled-coil region is bordered on both sides by potential phosphorylation sites. A tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site is located from amino acids 44 to 52, and a phosphorylation domain is located from amino acids 106 to 134, which contains several potential protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3). A nucleotide comparison by computer search did not reveal any significant homology between ISG20 and the sequences referenced in data bases. However, a search for amino acid sequence homologies revealed that the complete ISG20 protein shares amino acid cluster homologies with the Xenopus laevis XPMC2 gene product (46Su J.Y. Maller J.L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and with a theoretical ORF present in the genome ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (GenBank™ accession numberZ74822). Expression of XPMC2 cDNA has been shown to rescue in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombeseveral mitotic catastrophe mutants defective in both Wee1 and Mik1 kinases. These redundant kinases negatively regulate Cdc2 kinase by phosphorylating a conserved tyrosine residue. The XPMC2 gene product acts as a negative cell cycle regulator by competing with mitotic substrates for phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase (46Su J.Y. Maller J.L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The role and the regulation of the S. cerevisiae ORF remain unknown. On the basis of the amino acid homology between ISG20 and XPMC2, whose amino acid sequence alignment is presented in Fig. 4, it is tempting to speculate that ISG20 may be one of the elements that participate in the negative regulation of cell division, which would be consistent with the anti-growth properties of IFNs as found in particular in Daudi cells. We evaluated this hypothesis by analysis of the cell cycle distribution of cells overexpressing ISG20. To this aim, COS-7m6 cells were transiently transfected with a vector expressing ISG20. Transfection was performed by the LipofectAMINE procedure. The cells were collected 72 h later and analyzed with a flow cytometer after propidium iodide staining. Under these experimental conditions, no significant alteration in the cell cycle distribution was observed (data not shown). The recent release in the data bases of a human 5′-EST sequence (GenBank™ accession number R02224) with a high nucleotide identity to the XPMC2 cDNA clearly demonstrates that ISG20 is not the human homolog of XPMC2, but is a member of a new family of proteins. Surprisingly, human EST-like ISG20 corresponds to a short RNA and encodes a protein homologous only to the carboxylic half of the XPMC2 protein. The ISG20 amino acid sequence does not enclose a canonic bipartite nuclear localization signal, but the presence of lysine- and arginine-rich domains and the small size of the protein suggest that gpISG20 might be targeted to the nucleus. To determine the subcellular localization of ISG20, CCL13, CCL39, and COS cells were transfected with a tagged ISG20 protein. A fusion cDNA between the open reading frame of ISG20 and the HA epitope peptide sequence of the influenza virus was cloned under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pJ7Ω vector (pJ7TagHA-ISG20). Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation or LipofectAMINE method and then analyzed by immunofluorescence using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. The ectopically expressed ISG20 was predominantly nuclear and gave a speckled distribution pattern in all cell types (Fig.5 A). This localization was not dependent on the level of tagged ISG20 expression since the same pattern was observed in COS cells, which express a high level of transfected cDNA as compared with CCL39 and CCL13 cells. However, in CCL13 cells, ISG20 was diffusely distributed throughout the nucleoplasm in ∼30% of the positive cells. This percentage strongly suggests that the change in the intranuclear distribution of ISG20 might be dependent on the progression of the cell cycle. The nuclear dots containing ISG20 were dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm and were variable in size and number per nucleus (Fig. 5 A). The speckled nuclear staining pattern of ISG20 is reminiscent of the labeling observed for other cellular proteins such as PML and SP100, which colocalize within large multiprotein complexes called PML NBs (23Ascoli C.A.

Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) 1The abbreviations used are: GSL(s), glycosphingolipid(s); PDMP,Dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol);NB-DNJ, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin;NB-DGJ, N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; mAb, monoclonal antibody.1The abbreviations used are: GSL(s), glycosphingolipid(s); PDMP,Dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol);NB-DNJ, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin;NB-DGJ, N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; mAb, monoclonal antibody. are ubiquitous components of the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells where they are believed to mediate a number of biological functions (1Hakomori S J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their biosynthesis and catabolism have been extensively studied (2Sandhoff K. van Echten G. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 119-142PubMed Google Scholar, 3van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5341-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), as have the disease states that result from their incomplete catabolism within lysosomes (5Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). They are exploited as receptors by a number of micro-organisms (6Karlsson K.-A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 309-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar); however, their normal physiological functions remain largely obscure. GSL biosynthesis involves the co-ordinated action of multiple gene products (2Sandhoff K. van Echten G. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 119-142PubMed Google Scholar). A key enzyme in this pathway is the ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step in the GSL biosynthetic pathway, the transfer of glucose to ceramide to form glucosylceramide (GlcCer). The sequential action of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus converts glucosylceramide into other neutral GSLs and gangliosides (2Sandhoff K. van Echten G. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 119-142PubMed Google Scholar). The ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase has been cloned recently and is a unique gene product without substantial homology with other known glycosyltransferase genes (7Ishikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Kazuya I.-P. Hidari J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mutant B16 melanoma cells lacking this enzyme are not compromised in their growth or morphology, indicating that GSLs are not needed for membrane integrity and do not serve a basic housekeeping function, at least at the level of the single cell (7Ishikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Kazuya I.-P. Hidari J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Ichikawa S. Nakajo N. Sakiyama H. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). One approach to investigate the role of GSLs in intact organisms is to inactivate the glucosyltransferase either by gene disruption techniques or by using a specific inhibitor. It is not currently known the degree to which GSLs can be depleted in vivo in mammalian species without resulting in pathology (9Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1995; 7: 495-511Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The gene knockout approach would determine whether or not total inhibition of GSL synthesis is compatible with embryonic development. There is circumstantial evidence, such as the lack of human disease states that result from defects in GSL biosynthesis, which suggests that GSL expression may play a critical role in early mammalian development (4Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The complete lack of GSL biosynthesis during embryogenesis could therefore be potentially lethal. However, in studies of teleost development using Medaka fish in in vitro culture, extensive GSL inhibition resulting from treatment with the ceramide analogue PDMP did not disrupt development (10Fenderson B.A. Ostrander G.K. Hausken Z. Radin N.S. Hakamori S.-I. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The roles of GSLs during vertebrate development and their functions in the biology of the mature organism therefore remain to be elucidated. The alternative experimental approach which can be taken to explore GSL functions is to use specific inhibitors of enzymes required for the biosynthesis of GSLs. One advantage of this approach is that the consequences of partial GSL depletion can be investigated. An attractive target for enzyme inhibition is the ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step in the GSL biosynthetic pathway. We have recently identified two inhibitors of GSL biosynthesis that block the action of the ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase (11Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Karlsson G.B. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27108-27114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These inhibitors are the imino sugarsNbutyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) andN-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ), a glucose and galactose analogue, respectively. In vitro these analogues result in GSL depletion in a wide range of human and murine cell lines (11Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Karlsson G.B. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27108-27114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the extent to which they can reduce GSL levels in vivo is currently unknown, as is the extent to which GSL depletion can be tolerated in an intact adult mammal. The degree to which GSLs depletion is tolerated in vivo is also an important factor when considering GSL biosynthetic inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of the GSL lysosomal storage diseases, where in vivo GSL depletion is the primary clinical objective (9Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1995; 7: 495-511Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27108-27114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have administered NB-DNJ to young mice using a range of dosing regimes and monitored GSL biosynthesis.NB-DNJ was used, rather than the galactose analogueNB-DGJ, due to the fact that this compound is available in the multigram quantities required for this study. We have found significant GSL depletion in multiple tissues of mice treated withNB-DNJ without any overt toxicity, indicating that partial inhibition of GSL biosynthesis is well tolerated in vivo. The implications these data have for GSL function and the therapeutic administration of GSL inhibitors for treating GSL lysosomal storage disorders are discussed. NB-DNJ was a gift from Searle/Monsanto. Age- and sex-matched (6-week-old female) C57BL/6 mice were fed on a diet of powdered mouse chow (expanded Rat and Mouse Chow 1, ground, SDS Ltd., Witham, Essex, UK) containing NB-DNJ. The diet and compound (both as dry solids) were mixed thoroughly before use, stored at room temperature, and used within 7 days of mixing. Water was available to the micead libitum. The mice were housed under standard nonsterile conditions. The mice were maintained on 600 mg/kg/day per mouse for 50 days, and two animals were sacrificed from the control group (untreated, n = 10) and two from the experimental group (diet + NB-DNJ, n = 10). The remaining animals in the experimental group were then maintained on a 1200 mg/kg/day diet for a further 50 days when another two animals from each group were sacrificed. The remaining animals in the treated group were fed on a 1800 mg/kg/day diet for 20 days at which point all remaining animals from each group were sacrificed. In an independent study, animals were maintained on a 2400 mg/kg/day diet for 14 days. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture, the serum expressed, and stored at −20 °C prior to assay. Steady state serum levels ofNB-DNJ were determined by isolating compound from 50 μl of blood using AG-50W-X12 (H+ form) resin (200 μl of packed beads). Compound and an internal standard (N-hexyl-DNJ orN-propyl-DNJ) were eluted with a 4 m ammonia solution. Using radiolabeled compounds, greater than 99% of the compound was recovered from the resin. Detection of compound was achieved either by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF) or by cation-exchange chromatography. For mass spectrometry (Finnigan MAT), an internal standard was included with normal serum samples to construct a standard curve with NB-DNJ concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 μg/ml of serum. Cation-exchange chromatography (Dionex BioLC) was performed by an isocratic elution of a CS-10 column with sodium sulfate containing 5% (v/v) acetonitrile. Quantitation of NB-DNJ was obtained by peak area estimation in comparison with the internal standard and applying experimentally derived response factors. Tissue samples were homogenized in water, lyophilized, 5 mg of dry weight extracted in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) overnight at 4 °C, dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 20 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), and separated by TLC (chloroform:methanol:H20, 65:25:4). The TLC plate was air-dried, sprayed with α-naphthol (1% (w/v), in methanol) followed by 50% (v/v) sulfuric acid and heat-treated (80 °C for 10 min). The assay has been described previously (11Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, splenocytes from treated and untreated mice were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated cholera toxin B chain, for 30 min on ice in the dark. Quantitative flow cytometric analysis has been described elsewhere (11Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was performed using a FACScan Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale CA). Data on viable cells (propidium iodide dye exclusion) were collected on a 4-decade log10 scale of increasing fluorescence intensity. Splenocytes (3 × 107 mononuclear cells) from twoNB-DNJ-treated (2400 mg/kg/day) and two untreated mice were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1 mm sodium metaperiodate, and left on ice for 5 min. The oxidation was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml of PBS containing 0.1m glycerol. The cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and tritiated sodium borohydride added (0.8 mCi; specific activity, 12 Ci/mmol) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS and radiolabeled GSLs extracted from the cell pellet (2 × 1 ml of chloroform:methanol 2:1 (v/v) overnight at 4 °C and 2 h at room temperature). An equal volume of each extract (equivalent to 0.75 × 107 cells) was taken for analysis by high performance thin layer chromatography using a solvent of chloroform:methanol:0.5% CaCl2 (55:49:9, v/v/v). Radiolabeled GSLs were detected by fluorography and their migration compared with authentic GSL standards. The cell pellets remaining after the lipid extraction were resuspended in 200 μl of distilled water to which SDS was added (1% (w/v) final concentration) and dithiothreitol (0.5 mm, final concentration). The samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, spun at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and aliquots taken for radioactivity determination by scintillation counting. Protein content was determined using the BCA method (Pierce, Chester, UK) and 20-μg equivalents of protein analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography before and after treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK) Ltd., 50,000 units/ml final concentration for 4 h at 37 °C). The following rat mAbs were used for this study and have been described previously (13Platt F.M. Cebra-Thomas J.A. Baum C.M. Davie J.M. McKearn J.P. Cell. Immunol. 1992; 143: 449-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar): 187.1, anti-mouse κ light chain; GK1.5, anti-CD4; anti-Ly-2, CD8 (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA); and 7.3, anti-Lyt-1. A goat anti-rat fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Ortho) was used to detect anti-CD4, anti-κ and anti-Lyt-1 binding. The staining procedure and flow cytometry analysis have been described elsewhere (13Platt F.M. Cebra-Thomas J.A. Baum C.M. Davie J.M. McKearn J.P. Cell. Immunol. 1992; 143: 449-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Data on viable cells (propidium iodide dye exclusion) were collected on a 4-decade log10 scale of increasing fluorescence intensity. The percentage of cells staining with the mAbs was defined by the positioning of cursors on the basis of the unstained control (autofluorescent background) for directly conjugated mAbs or on the basis of the secondary only control with the nonconjugated mAbs. To monitor the overall well being of the mice treated with NB-DNJ, the mice were monitored daily, body weights recorded, and the effects ofNB-DNJ on growth rates determined (Fig.1). The doses of NB-DNJ given over the course of the study are indicated with arrows. Over the treatment period, and with the dosing regime given, the mice on theNB-DNJ containing diet grew slower than the untreated sex- and age-matched controls. The final body weights attained at the end of the study (118 days, 2400 mg/kg/day) were 15% lower in theNB-DNJ-treated group. When the mice were switched to a diet rich in glucose (65%, w/w), but lacking complex carbohydrates (AIN 76, SDS), the body weights remained 15% lower than the untreated controls. The mice had no diarrhea at any stage in the study, in contrast to mice given comparable or lower concentrations of NB-DNJ by oral gavage every 8 h. 2D. Semler, personal communication. The general appearance, activity levels, and condition of theNB-DNJ-treated mice were comparable with the untreated controls (data not shown), indicating that the animals toleratedNB-DNJ in their diet and were not overtly compromised by its administration. Serum levels of NB-DNJ were determined at all the dosing levels and were found to range in a dose-dependent fashion from 18 μm at 600 mg/kg/day to 57 μm at 2400 mg/kg/day (TableI).Table ISteady state serum levels of NB-DNJDoseSerum levelmg/kg/dayμm60018.2120030.6180043240056.8Serum levels of NB-DNJ were determined at each dose of compound on serum samples from at least three animals, and each serum sample was analyzed twice by high performance liquid chromatography or four times by mass spectrometry. The values are means and the variance was within ±10% for all samples evaluated. Open table in a new tab Serum levels of NB-DNJ were determined at each dose of compound on serum samples from at least three animals, and each serum sample was analyzed twice by high performance liquid chromatography or four times by mass spectrometry. The values are means and the variance was within ±10% for all samples evaluated. As a measure of cellular GSL levels, cell surface ganglioside levels were determined on splenocytes from treated and untreated mice, using fluoresceinated cholera toxin B chain as a probe for GM1 ganglioside (11Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were assayed by flow cytometry and binding sites per cell quantitated using fluorescent microbead standards. The percent reduction in cholera toxin binding sites per cell was measured at each drug dose (Fig.2). At 600 mg/kg/day the splenocytes had 10% fewer cholera toxin binding sites per cell than the untreated aged matched controls. This increased to an approximate 35% reduction at doses in the range of 1200–1800 mg/kg/day and to 50% at the highest dose tested, 2400 mg/kg/day. These data indicate that GSL depletion occurs in vivo in response to NB-DNJ and is dose-dependent. Cell surface glycoconjugates were examined in more detail by incorporating a radiolabel into cell surface sialic acid residues. Mild periodate treatment of glycoconjugates results in the selective oxidation of sialic acid residues. The aldehydes formed are reduced with NaB3H4 to stable, tritium-labeled 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-l-arabino-2-heptulosonic acid. Using the conditions described, this method specifically introduces a label into cell surface sialic acids, including those carried by gangliosides (14Gahmberg C.G. Andersson L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5888-5894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The autoradiograph of the high performance TLC separation of solvent extracted GSLs from splenocytes from two untreated mice and two treated with NB-DNJ (Fig.3 A) showed a quantitative decrease (60–70% reduction by densitometry) in labeled species compared with those from untreated animals. There did not appear to be a qualitative difference in the gangliosides extracted from labeled cells from the two groups of mice, nor were there any changes in the relative abundance of individual gangliosides in individual animals. These data strongly suggest that the expression of cell surface gangliosides is decreased in a nonselective manner as a result of treatment with NB-DNJ. When the protein fraction from these samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography, no discernible differences could be detected in the profile, either before or after peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment, of sialic acid containing glycoproteins derived from untreated andNB-DNJ-treated animals (Fig. 3 B). Using the same enzyme incubation conditions, mouse IgM was completely de-N-glycosylated (results not shown). This indicated that α-glucosidase inhibition was not occurring at the serum levels achieved; hence, there was no apparent reduction in glycoproteins carrying sialylated N-glycans. To determine the degree of GSL depletion in a non-lymphoid tissue, liver was chloroform:methanol-extracted and total lipids analyzed by thin layer chromatography. A reduction in GSL levels in the mice treated withNB-DNJ was observed, including GM2 and the trihexoside species (Fig. 4). Sphingomyelin levels increased in NB-DNJ-treated mice, presumably due to the increased levels of ceramide available to go down this biosynthetic pathway, due to inhibition of GSL biosynthesis. Removal of the drug from the diet for 2 weeks resulted in relatively normal liver GSL levels with sphingomyelin being present in quantities comparable with the untreated controls and the trihexoside species being detectable. GM2 levels were slower to recover, and this ganglioside was barely detectable after the 2-week period, following removal of NB-DNJ from the diet. GSL depletion was therefore occurring in livers of NB-DNJ-treated mice and was reversible following drug withdrawal. The fact that GM2recovery is slow may indicate possible long term effect of the drug. Spleens and thymuses removed from NB-DNJ mice were observed to be consistently smaller (on a wet weight basis) than those from untreated age matched controls. For example, spleens from 600–1800 mg/kg/day were 30% lighter than the untreated controls (±6%), and at 2400 mg/kg/day they were on average 55% lighter (±6%) than spleens taken from age-matched control mice. This was in contrast to organs such as liver and brain, which were comparable by wet weight, irrespective ofNB-DNJ treatment (data not shown). To investigate the nature of the reduction in lymphoid tissue size in response to NB-DNJ treatment, the 2400 mg/kg/day animals were investigated further. A cohort of animals were fed on aNB-DNJ-containing diet and changes in spleen and thymus size monitored over time (Fig. 5, Aand B). Both tissues reduced in size in response toNB-DNJ treatment, and maximal reduction in organ size occurred between 7 and 11 days following drug administration. The lymphoid tissues remained smaller as long as the animals were treated with NB-DNJ, but returned to normal size after 2 weeks following withdrawal of the drug from the diet (for example, spleen; Fig. 6).Figure 6Spleen weights following withdrawal ofNB-DNJ from the diet. Mice were treated withNB-DNJ (2400 mg/kg/day) and their spleen weights determined after 2 weeks. The drug was withdrawn from an age-matchedNB-DNJ-treated group of animals for a further 2 weeks and their spleen weights measured. The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. for an untreated age-matched control group of mice (−),NB-DNJ-treated mice (+), and the drug withdrawal group (+/−).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cellular compositions of spleen and thymus after 2 weeks on 2400 mg/kg/day NB-DNJ were examined by flow cytometry (TableII). The spleen contained a higher percentage of T cells relative to the frequencies observed in untreated animals (44% compared with 30%), and the B cell frequencies were reduced from 51% in untreated controls to 45% inNB-DNJ-treated mice. When drug was removed from the diet, within 2 weeks the relative proportions of T and B cells within the spleen returned to normal levels (Table II). The increased proportion of T cells within the spleen was due to an increased frequency of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, with the greatest increase being in the CD8+ cells (9% positive in the untreated spleen to 16% positive in the NB-DNJ-treated spleen), while CD4+ cells accounted for 20% of cells in the untreated spleen and 31% in NB-DNJ-treated spleen. Histological examination of spleens from untreated and NB-DNJ-treated mice showed no gross morphological differences with normal follicular architecture maintained in spleens from NB-DNJ-treated mice (data not shown).Table IIEffect of NB-DNJ on the cellular compositions of mouse spleenNB-DNJPercent cells positiveLyt-1CD4CD8Kappa−30.75 ± 2.720.5 ± 2.79 ± 1.250.75 ± 4.3+44 ± 3.031 ± 2.816 ± 1.044.5 ± 0.5±33.5 ± 2.521.5 ± 3.59.5 ± 0.549 ± 8.0Immunophenotyping of splenocytes by flow cytometry from untreated andNB-DNJ-treated mice.

Two-color flow cytometry after 7 days of NB-DNJ treatment revealed that, in contrast to the untreated thymus, which has a typical composition of approximately 5% CD4−/CD8−, 80% CD4+/CD8+, 10% CD4+/CD8−, and 5% CD4−/CD8+ cells, the NB-DNJ-treated mice had an increased frequency of single positive cells. For example the thymuses from NB-DNJ-treated mice contained approximately 7% CD4−/CD8−, 65% CD4+/CD8+, 18% CD4+/CD8−, and 10% CD4−/CD8+ cells (Fig.7). There was therefore an increase in the proportion of single CD4+ or CD8+ cells at the expense of CD4+/CD8+ double positive cells.

A. 1994; 91: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), their functions must reside in more complex aspects of mammalian biology. If these functions are to be elucidated, methods and reagents are required that will permit GSL manipulationin vivo as well as in vitro. Although we can inhibit GSL biosynthesis in vitro using a number of pharmacological agents, compounds are required that are well tolerated long term in vivo. There are currently two main classes of GSL biosynthesis inhibitor that have been characterized to date which specifically target the ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase. The first class of inhibitors described were the ceramide analogues of which the prototypic compound is PDMP (15Vunnam R.R. Radin N.S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1980; 26: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By virtue of ceramide mimicry these compounds prevent the glucosylation of ceramide by acting as reversible mixed-type inhibitors (16Inokuchi J.-I. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 278-565Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, the highly hydrophobic nature of these compounds makes their long term administration to animals problematic (9Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1995; 7: 495-511Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The second group of GSL biosynthesis inhibitors are the N-alkylated imino sugars, such as the glucose analogue NB-DNJ. The nonalkylated parental compound (DNJ) does not inhibit the ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase, and a minimal alkyl chain length is required to render these compounds inhibitory, with butyl and hexyl chains being optimal (11Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alkyl chain may render these compounds short chain ceramide mimics or serve to target these compounds to the membrane environment where the glucosyltransferase resides (9Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1995; 7: 495-511Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The alkylated imino sugars have a major advantage over PDMP and related compounds in that they exhibit minimal cytotoxicity in vitro, even at doses in excess of 2 mm (17Fischer P.B. Colin M. Karlsson G.B. James W. Butters T.D. Davis S.J. Gordon S. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5791-5797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They therefore have the potential to be well tolerated in vivo. In this study we have investigated whether or not we can achieve GSL depletion in vivo in healthy mice treated orally withNB-DNJ and whether GSL depletion is in any way deleterious to the animal. When mice were treated with various doses of NB-DNJ, serum levels in the range of 18–57 μm were achieved. Similar serum levels (steady state trough level of approximately 20 μm) were achieved in humans during the evaluation of this compound as an antiviral agent when patients were treated with 43 mg/kg/day (18Fischl M.A. Resnick L.

The objective of this study was to understand the possible mechanism(s) underlying such variations in the rate of O·̄2 generation. The hypothesis that the relative amounts of the ubiquinones or coenzyme Q (CoQ) homologues, CoQ9 and CoQ10, are related with the rate of O·̄2 generation was tested. A comparison of nine different mammalian species, namely mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, pig, goat, sheep, cow, and horse, which vary from 3.5 to 46 years in their maximum longevity, indicated that the rate of O·̄2 generation in cardiac submitochondrial particles (SMPs) was directly related to the relative amount of CoQ9 and inversely related to the amount of CoQ10, extractable from their cardiac mitochondria. To directly test the relationship between CoQ homologues and the rate of O·̄2 generation, rat heart SMPs, naturally containing mainly CoQ9 and cow heart SMPs, with high natural CoQ10 content, were chosen for depletion/reconstitution experiments. Repeated extractions of rat heart SMPs with pentane exponentially depleted both CoQ homologues while the corresponding rates of O·̄2 generation and oxygen consumption were lowered linearly. Reconstitution of both rat and cow heart SMPs with different amounts of CoQ9 or CoQ10 caused an initial increase in the rates of O·̄2 generation, followed by a plateau at high concentrations. Within the physiological range of CoQ concentrations, there were no differences in the rates of O·̄2generation between SMPs reconstituted with CoQ9 or CoQ10. Only at concentrations that were considerably higher than the physiological level, the SMPs reconstituted with CoQ9 exhibited higher rates of O·̄2 generation than those obtained with CoQ10. These in vitrofindings do not support the hypothesis that differences in the distribution of CoQ homologues are responsible for the variations in the rates of mitochondrial O·̄2 generation in different mammalian species.

A current hypothesis of aging postulates that oxidative stress/damage is a major causal factor in the attrition of functional capacity occurring during the aging process (1Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6606) Google Scholar, 2Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar, 3Sohal R.S. Orr W.C. Esser K.

The basic tenet of this hypothesis is that there is an intrinsic imbalance between the reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviation used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CoQ9, coenzyme Q9; CoQ10, coenzyme Q10; MLSP, maximum life span potential; O·̄2, superoxide anion radical; SMPs, submitochondrial particles; TTFA, 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedione; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. that are incessantly generated in the aerobic cells and the antioxidative defense against them, thereby resulting in the accrual of steady-state levels of oxidative molecular damage. The direct evidence in support of this hypothesis is that the augmentation of antioxidative defenses by simultaneous overexpression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, which converts superoxide anion radicals (O·̄2) into H2O2, and catalase, which removes H2O2, retards the age-associated increase in the levels of molecular oxidative damage and extends the life span ofDrosophila melanogaster by one-third (7Orr W.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15671-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although there are several intracellular loci for the generation of O·̄2 (the first molecule in the ROS series), it is widely accepted that the mitochondrial electron transport chain is the main source of O·̄2 (9Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar, 10Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehinger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Previous studies in this laboratory have indicated that the rate of mitochondrial O·̄2 generation varies greatly, even in the same type of tissue, among different mammalian species and is inversely related to the maximum life span potential (MLSP) of the species (11Sohal R.S. Svensson l. Sohal B.H. Brunk U.T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1989; 49: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Ku H.H. Brunk U.T. Sohal R.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The inverse relationship between the rate of O·̄2 generation and MLSP was found to hold in a sample of mammalian species as well as a group of dipteran insect species (11Sohal R.S. Svensson l. Sohal B.H. Brunk U.T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1989; 49: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Ku H.H. Brunk U.T. Sohal R.S. Free Radical Biol.

The question that arose out of these studies and that is also the subject of this investigation is what is the underlying mechanism for the variations in the rates of mitochondrial O·̄2 generation in different species? Although opinions vary (14Beyer R.E. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 545-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), a number of experimental studies in the literature suggest that ubiquinones modulate the rate of mitochondrial O·̄2/H2O2 generation (10Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehinger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 15Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem.

Free Radicals, Lipoproteins, and Membrane Lipids. Plenum Press, New York1990: 203-212Crossref Google Scholar). Ubiquinones (2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-multiprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone), or coenzyme Q (CoQ), is a quinone derivative with a chain of 1–12 isoprene units in the different homologue forms (CoQ n) occurring in nature. Relatively short-lived mammalian species such as the mouse and the rat primarily contain CoQ9, whereas the larger long-lived mammals such as man predominantly exhibit CoQ10 (19Ramasarma T. Lenaz G. Coenzyme Q. John Wiley, London1985: 67-81Google Scholar). The present study tests the hypothesis that variations in the rate of O·̄2 by cardiac submitochondrial particles (SMPs) in different mammalian species are related to the relative CoQ9 and/or CoQ10 content. The hypothesis was prompted by the fact that longevity of non-primate mammalian species tends to be inversely correlated with the rate of mitochondrial O·̄2 generation and directly correlated with the body mass. All solvents used were of HPLC grade (Fisher). Ubiquinone-9, ubiquinone-10, (±)-tocopherol and ferricytochromec (Type Vl), superoxide dismutase, rotenone, antimycin A, and 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedione (TTFA) were purchased from Sigma. Hearts were obtained from mouse (Swiss), rat (Harlan Sprague Dawley), guinea pig (Hartley Albino), rabbit (New Zealand White), pig (Yorkshire), goat (Angora), sheep (Rambouillet), cow (Holstein), and horse (mixed) which range from 3.5 to 46 years in MLSP (21Altman P.L.

Acta. 1982; 689: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All the animals were young, healthy, sexually mature adult males. The approximate ages of the animals were: mouse, rat, and guinea pig, 4 months; rabbit, 7 months; pig, 6–7 months; goat and sheep, 1 year; cow and horse, 3 years. In smaller animals the entire heart was processed; however, in the pig, cow, and horse the hearts were cut into smaller pieces, and representative samples were selected. The values for the rates of O·̄2 generation in different species are partially based on the result of previous studies in this laboratory (12Ku H.H. Brunk U.T. Sohal R.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 22Ku H.H. Sohal R.S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 72: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). MLSP values for different species, obtained from the literature (20Comfort A. The Biology of Senescence. Elsevier Science Inc., New York1979: 60-63Google Scholar, 21Altman P.L. Dittmer D.S.

Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described by Arcos et al. (23Arcos J.C. Sohal R.S. Sun S.C. Argus M.F. Bruch G.E. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1968; 8: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, pieces of the heart were homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of isolation buffer containing 180 mm KCl, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MOPS, 10 mm EGTA Tris base, pH 7.2, at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 17,500 × g. The resulting mitochondrial pellet was washed and resuspended in 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. To prepare SMPs, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and sonicated three times, each consisting of a 30-s pulse burst, at 1-min intervals at 4 °C. The sonicated mitochondria were centrifuged at 8,250 ×g for 10 min to remove the unbroken organelles; the supernatant was recentrifuged at 80,000 × g for 45 min, and the resulting pellet was washed and resuspended in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, as described previously (12Ku H.H. Brunk U.T. Sohal R.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). CoQ was extracted from mitochondria using a hexane:ethanol mixture as described by Takadaet al. (24Takada M. Ikenoya S. Yuzuriha T. Katayama K. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of mitochondrial suspension, containing ∼100 μg of protein and 50 μl of double-distilled H2O were mixed with 750 μl of hexane:ethanol (5:2) for 1 min using a vortex mixture. The mixture was centrifuged for 3 min at 1,200 × g, and 450 μl of the hexane layer was collected, dried under helium, and dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol. Quantitation of ubiquinones was performed by HPLC by the method of Katayama et al. (25Katayama K. Takada M. Yuzuriha T. Abe K. Ikenoya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ethanol extract (10–20 μl) was chromatographed on a reverse phase C18 HPLC column (25.0 × 0.46 cm, 5 μm, Supelco), using a mobile phase consisting of 0.7% NaClO4 in ethanol:methanol:70% HClO4 (900:100:1) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml. The electrochemical and UV detectors consisted of an ESA Coulochem II and a Waters Associates Model 440 absorbance detector at a wavelength of 280 nm. The setting of the electrochemical detector was as follows: guard cell (upstream of the injector) at +200 mV, conditioning cell at −550 mV (downstream of the column), followed by the analytical cell at +150 mV. The concentrations of ubiquinones were estimated by comparison of the peak area with those of standard solutions of known concentration. Submitochondrial particles were depleted of native CoQ by pentane extraction, as described by Maguire et al. (26Maguire J.T. Kagan V. Ackress B.A.C. Serbinova E. Packer L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and selectively repleted with exogenous CoQ9 or CoQ10. Aliquots of SMPs (100 μl containing ∼250 μg of protein) were freeze-dried and extracted 6 times, each for 45 min at 4 °C, with 1 ml of pentane containing 15 μm α-tocopherol (for the last extraction pure pentane was used). The pentane layer was removed by centrifugation and discarded. In some cases the pentane layer was collected and brought to dryness under a stream of helium and resuspended in 100 μl of ethanol, and the CoQ content was measured by HPLC. Various amounts of CoQ9 or CoQ10 were added to pentane-extracted and/or freeze-dried SMPs, dried under helium, resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and sonicated for up to 3 s in a Branson 2200 sonicator. CoQ depletion and incorporation of exogenous CoQ9 or CoQ10 into SMPs membranes were confirmed by hexane:ethanol extraction and HPLC analysis, as described above. Rate of O·̄2 generation by SMPs was measured as superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of acetylated ferricytochrome c (27Ernster L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), as described previously (12Ku H.H. Brunk U.T. Sohal R.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 10 μm acetylated ferricytochrome c, 6 μm rotenone, 1.2 μm antimycin A, 100 units of superoxide dismutase/ml (in the reference cuvette), and 10–100 μg of SMP protein in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction was started by adding 7.5 mm succinate, and the reduction of acetylated ferricytochrome c was followed at 550 nm. The rate of respiration of submitochondrial particles was measured polarographically using a Clark-type electrode at 37 °C. The incubation mixture, to measure state 4 respiration, consisted of buffer (154 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KPO4, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) and 30–100 μg of SMP protein; 7 mm succinate and/or 7 mm NADH were used as substrates, and 1.2 μm antimycin A, 6 μmrotenone, or 0.5 mm TTFA were employed as specific respiratory inhibitors. Comparisons of the concentrations of CoQ9 and CoQ10 extracted from the heart mitochondria were made in nine different mammalian species, namely mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, pig, goat, sheep, cow, and horse. The data, presented in Table I and Fig.1, indicate that both the total as well as the relative concentrations of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in heart mitochondria vary greatly in different species. The total concentration of mitochondrial CoQ, i.e.CoQ9 + CoQ10, varied about 2-fold in different species with the rank order: horse > mouse > cow > sheep = goat > rat > pig > rabbit > guinea pig. Although all nine species examined in this study contained both CoQ9 and CoQ10 the ratio of CoQ10/CoQ9 varied > 600-fold. In species such as the mouse and the rat almost 90% of mitochondrial CoQ occurred as CoQ9 while in the guinea pig CoQ9 and CoQ10 were present in roughly equal amounts. In mitochondria from rabbit, pig, goat, sheep, cow, and horse, CoQ10 was the predominant form, with CoQ9constituting ∼1.3 to 4.0% of the total CoQ content.Table IComparison of CoQ 9 and CoQ 10 content of heart mitochondria between nine different mammalia speciesSpeciesCoenzyme QCoQ9CoQ10CoQ9 + CoQ10nmol/mg mitochondrial proteinMouse6.0 ± .040.72 ± .046.72Rat5.2 ± .110.63 ± .025.83Guinea pig1.9 ± .0061.7 ± .023.6Rabbit0.11 ± .014.8 ± .104.91Pig0.19 ± .0074.8 ± .044.99Goat0.25 ± .036.2 ± .056.45Sheep0.15 ± .016.3 ± .116.45Cow0.11 ± .0066.5 ± .186.51Horse0.17 ± .016.6 ± .086.77Values are average ± S.E. of three determinations. Open table in a new tab Values are average ± S.E. of three determinations. To determine the relationship between mitochondrial CoQ content and the rate of O·̄2 generation in different species, the amounts of CoQ9 and of CoQ10 were plotted against the average rates of O·̄2 generation by SMPs, partially determined in the context of previous studies (12Ku H.H. Brunk U.T. Sohal R.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the amount of CoQ9 was directly correlated and that of CoQ10was inversely correlated (Fig. 1 B) with the rate of O·̄2 generation in different species. There was no correlation between the total amount of CoQ content and the rate of O·̄2generation (data not presented). The results of the correlational study, presented in Fig. 1, led to the question of whether the relationship between mitochondrial CoQ homologues and the rate of O·̄2 generation was purely coincidental or causally related. To investigate the possible existence of a causal relationship, SMPs were experimentally depleted of native CoQ and reconstituted with either CoQ9 or CoQ10. These studies were conducted on cardiac SMPs of rat, a short-lived species containing relatively high amounts of CoQ9, and of cow, a representative of the long-lived species containing relatively high CoQ10 content. Repeated extractions with pentane were found to exponentially deplete the amount of native CoQ9 from the rat heart SMPs (Fig. 2,inset); the amount remaining after six serial extractions was about 4.5% of the total amount extractable by hexane. In contrast, apparently due to the much lower natural content of CoQ10, only three extractions with pentane were sufficient to deplete SMPs of CoQ10 to a level below the detection threshold of 0.2 μm (i.e. 0.015 nmol/mg of SMP protein). To determine the effect of pentane extractions on the functional state of the SMPs, rates of oxygen consumption and O·̄2 generation were determined after each extraction procedure. The rate of succinate-supplemented oxygen consumption was highest in the unextracted SMPs, decreasing linearly following each extraction procedure, reaching 25% of the initial value after seven successive extraction procedures (Fig. 2). Addition of antimycin A and TTFA greatly reduced (to <2%) the rate of oxygen consumption by the depleted SMPs, whereas rotenone had no effect, indicating that O2 consumption observed was specifically due to succinate oxidase activity. NADH did not, in most instances, stimulate the rate of oxygen consumption by the depleted SMPs. A similar study was conducted on the effect of various pentane extractions on the rate of O·̄2 generation by the SMPs. Again, the rate of O·̄2 generation was highest in the unextracted SMPs and progressively declined with each sequential pentane extraction, reaching 45% of the control value after six extraction procedures, where less than 5% of the original CoQ was present (Fig.3). Overall the results of the depletion experiments indicated that even after six or seven serial extractions with pentane the SMPs exhibited succinate oxidase activity and were able to generate O·̄2 albeit at rates lower than the unprocessed SMPs. Rat heart SMPs that had been extracted with pentane six times, as described above, were reconstituted with different amounts of CoQ9 and CoQ10. Reconstitution with increasing amounts of CoQ9 or CoQ10 caused an initial steep increase in the succinate-supplemented rate of oxygen consumption, which was followed by a plateau (Fig.4 B, inset). No significant differences in the rates of oxygen consumption were observed between the SMPs reconstituted with equal amounts of CoQ9 or CoQ10. Reconstitution of the depleted rat heart SMPs with increasing amounts of CoQ9 resulted in an initial sharp rise in the rate of O·̄2 generation, followed by a more gradual increase (Fig.4 A, inset). At the highest concentration of repleted CoQ9 used in this study, the rate of O·̄2generation increased about 2-fold as compared with the depleted SMPs. Addition of increasing amounts of CoQ10 to the depleted SMPs also caused an initial steep rise in the rate of O·̄2generation, but unlike CoQ9 further additions did not result in correspondingly increased rates of O·̄2generation (Fig. 4 A). For example, rat heart SMPs reconstituted with 50 nmol of CoQ9 exhibited a rate of O·̄2 generation that was 40% higher than when an equal amount of CoQ10 was used for reconstitution. The rate of succinate-supplemented oxygen consumption and O·̄2 generation by SMPs, reconstituted with different amounts of CoQ9 or CoQ10, were virtually undetectable following the addition of TTFA, demonstrating the involvement of electron transport chain and succinate oxidase activity in these two functions. It should however be noted that up to and within the physiological range of CoQ concentrations there were no differences in the rates of O·̄2generation between SMPs reconstituted with CoQ9 or CoQ10 (Fig. 4 A, inset). The differences between CoQ9- and CoQ10-reconstituted SMPs emerged only at concentrations considerably greater than the in vivo level (Table I). In contrast to the rat, bovine cardiac SMPs contain a relatively high amount of CoQ10 and a small amount of CoQ9 (see Table I). Depletion of bovine SMPs by six serial extractions with pentane achieved a 96% extraction of CoQ10 and virtually the entire amounts of the detectable CoQ9. Reconstitution of these depleted SMPs with varying concentrations of CoQ9 or CoQ10 indicated different patterns for the two homologues for the rate of oxygen consumption and of O·̄2 generation. Augmentation of SMPs with relatively low amounts of CoQ9 or CoQ10 caused a sharp increase in both the rate of oxygen consumption (Fig. 5 B,inset) and O·̄2 generation (Fig. 5 A,inset), but at higher concentrations these rates leveled off. Within the physiological range of CoQ content (Table I), there were no differences in the rates of O·̄2 generation between SMPs reconstituted with CoQ9 or CoQ10 (Fig.5 A, inset). However, the maximal rates of O·̄2 generation were greater for CoQ9 than for CoQ10. For example, in the bovine SMPs, reconstituted with 50 nmol of CoQ9, the rate of O·̄2 generation was 35% greater than in the SMPs reconstituted with an equal amount of CoQ10 (Fig. 5 A). To further determine whether CoQ9 and CoQ10content above the in vivo level had a different effect on the rate of O·̄2 generation, freeze-dried unextracted bovine SMPs were augmented with CoQ9 or CoQ10. As shown in Fig. 6, the rates of O·̄2 generation were stimulated to a greater extent by the addition of CoQ9 than CoQ10. The differences in the rate of O·̄2 generation tended to increase with the augmented amounts of CoQ9 or CoQ10 in the SMPs. Results of this study indicated that rates of O·̄2generation in different mammalian species are directly correlated with the amounts of mitochondrial CoQ9 and are inversely related to the CoQ10 content. The in vitrodepletion/reconstitution studies do not, however, support the hypothesis that variations in the relative concentrations of CoQ9 and CoQ10 are directly involved in the modulation of rates of O·̄2 generation in mitochondria. Although it is widely believed that the components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, located within the domains of NADH- and succinate-cytochrome c reductase, are the main sites of O·̄2 generation (9Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar, 10Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehinger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), there are at least two different schools of thought about whether or not autoxidation of ubisemiquinone is indeed the actual source of O·̄2 generation. The view, implicating ubisemiquinone (15Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar, 16Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem.

Plenum Press, New York1990: 203-212Crossref Google Scholar), is based on the following evidence: (i) rates of O·̄2/H2O2generation by SMPs and/or mitochondria are highest in the presence of rotenone and antimycin A with succinate as the substrate (9Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar); (ii) bovine heart SMPs, depleted of endogenous CoQ and reconstituted with variable amounts of exogenous CoQ, exhibit a linear relationship with the amount of quinone added (15Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar, 16Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar); (iii) rates of O·̄2generation by isolated NADH-ubiquinone reductase particles, supplemented with different CoQ homologues, were found to be linearly dependent on the amount of exogenous CoQ (17Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.L. Stoppani A.O.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar); and (iv) in reconstituted SMPs, activities of succinate dehydrogenase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase reached a plateau at relative low concentrations of reducible CoQ, whereas the rate of H2O2 generation was linearly related to a higher range of CoQ concentration (16Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In the opposing view (14Beyer R.E. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 545-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), such observations do not necessarily establish a direct association between autoxidation of ubisemiquinone and O·̄2 generation. It is argued that such findings are also compatible with the interpretation that the iron-sulfur centers in mitochondrial respiratory complex I (NADH- ubiquinone reductase), II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase), or III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase) may be the sources of O·̄2 generation. While the results of the present study are insufficient to resolve this controversy, they however support the view that CoQ is directly or indirectly associated with the modulation of the rates of O·̄2 generation, since experimental variations in its content have a clear effect on the rate of O·̄2generation. Results of this study should be interpreted in light of the fact that the preparatory procedures involving freeze-drying and pentane extractions, although widely employed (15Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar, 16Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 17Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.L. Stoppani A.O.M. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1992; 292: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Ernster L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), have an irreversible effect on the functional state of SMPs. For example, freeze-drying of SMPs followed by depletion and reconstitution with the original (natural) amount of CoQ decreased the rate of O·̄2generation by about 30% and of oxygen consumption by about 60%. However, the rates of O·̄2 generation and oxygen consumption of pentane-extracted SMPs, reconstituted with relatively high concentrations of CoQ9 or CoQ10, reached the level comparable to the unextracted freeze-dried preparations. In both the rat and the bovine heart SMPs there were no differences in the rates of O·̄2 generation between SMPs reconstituted with thein vivo amounts of CoQ9 or CoQ10. Only at concentrations higher than those present under physiological conditions relatively higher rates of O·̄2 generation were obtained with CoQ9 than with CoQ10. The same tendency was observed when unextracted bovine SMPs were augmented with CoQ9 or CoQ10. Altogether results of depletion/reconstitution and/or augmentation studies suggest that CoQ9 and CoQ10 differ in their in vitro effect on the rate of O·̄2 generation only at concentrations that exceed the in vivo amounts. A question arising from this study and also having some bearing on the interpretation of the present results concerns the nature of the structural differences between CoQ9 and CoQ10molecules that apparently exert an effect on the rate of O·̄2generation, albeit at high concentrations. Indeed, the molecular structural differences between CoQ9(C54H82O4;M r 794; melting point 44–45 °C) and CoQ1O (C59H90O4;M r 862; melting point 49 °C) (28Hatefi Y. Adv. Enzymol. 1963; 25: 275-328PubMed Google Scholar) are relatively minor. Nevertheless, the relative length of the polyisoprenoid chain and the resultant effects on the hydrophobicity of the molecule have been shown to have an effect on the location of the molecule within the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Although the relative position of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in the phospholipid bilayer has not been precisely determined, the CoQ homologues with relatively short polyisoprenoid chains are believed to lie closer to the surface of the bilayer, whereas the long chained ones are thought to be nearer to the center of the bilayer (29Katsikas H. Quinn P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 689: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Fato R. Battino M. Castelli G.P. Lenaz G.

For example, studies by Kagan et al. (33Kagan V. Serbinova E.A. Koynova G.M. Kitanova S.A. Tyurin V.A. Stoytchev T.S. Quinn P.J. Packer L. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have shown that short chain ubiquinols are relatively more efficient in inhibiting Fe2+-ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation, suggesting that the polyisoprenoid chain length has an effect on the interaction between the quinols and the ROS present in the aqueous phase. Studies by Matsura et al. (34Matsura T. Yamada K. Kawaski T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) on rat and guinea pig hepatocytes also implicate major differences in antioxidant efficiency between the reduced CoQ9 and the reduced CoQ10. In response to the hydrophilic radical initiator, 2–2-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, CoQ9 was found to be preferentially oxidized as compared with CoQ10homologue and thus may be more accessible to ROS present in the surrounding aqueous phase. This mechanism, albeit hypothetical, may underlie the relatively higher rates of O·̄2 generation in highly CoQ9-rich SMPs observed in this study. Functional differences between CoQ9 and CoQ10have also been reported by Edlund et al. (35Edlund C. Holmberg K. Dallner G. Norrby E. Kristensson K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), who found that treatment of mumps virus-infected cultured neurons with CoQ10 protected the cells from degeneration, whereas no effects were observed in response to CoQ9 treatment. Results of the present in vitro studies demonstrate that CoQ9 and CoQ10 homologues can differentially affect the rate of O·̄2 generation at high concentrations; however, the in vivo variations in rates of mitochondrial O·̄2 generation among different mammalian species cannot be explained on the basis of relative CoQ9 or CoQ10 content."

GPI-anchored proteins are fixed to the cell surface solely by a phospholipid moiety and are clustered in distinct membrane domains that are formed by an unique lipid composition requiring cholesterol. To elucidate the role of membrane lipids for signal transduction via GPI-anchored proteins, we studied the influence of reduced cellular cholesterol content on calcium signaling via GPI-anchored CD59 and CD48 in Jurkat T cells. Lowering cholesterol by different inhibitors of cellular cholesterol synthesis suppressed calcium response via GPI-anchored proteins by about 50%, whereas stimulation via CD3 was only minimally affected (<10%). The decrease in overall calcium response via GPI-anchored proteins was reflected by inhibition of calcium release from intracellular stores. Cell surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins was not changed quantitatively by lowering cellular cholesterol, and neither was the pattern of immunofluorescence in microscopic examination. In addition, the distribution of GPI-anchored proteins in detergent-insoluble complexes remained unaltered. These results suggest that cellular cholesterol is an important prerequisite for signal transduction via GPI-anchored proteins beyond formation of membrane domains.

GPI-anchored proteins are linked to the plasma membrane by a phospholipid moiety residing in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer (25Englund P.T. Annu. Rev.

Since GPI-anchored proteins have no direct connection to the cytoplasm, the mechanism by which signal transduction can occur is not yet elucidated. However, GPI-linked proteins are clustered in membrane domains (26Cinek T. Horejsı́ V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2262-2270PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol.

Accordingly, exogenously added CD59 was prevented from entering GPI complexes by filipin (5van den Berg C.W. Cinek T. Hallett M.B. Horejsi V. Morgan B.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and internalization of endogenous CD59 was partially inhibited by nystatin in lymphocytes (39Deckert M. Ticchioni M. Bernard A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which suggests that membrane cholesterol plays an important role for the distribution and function of GPI-anchored proteins. Here we studied the influence of membrane cholesterol on signal transduction via GPI-anchored CD59 and CD48 in T cells. To this end, cellular cholesterol content was reduced by culture in the presence of cholesterol synthesis inhibitors. Subsequently the rise in cytoplasmic calcium concentration was analyzed following cross-linking of GPI-anchored proteins or stimulation via the T cell receptor-CD3 complex, which served as a control. The calcium response was chosen for quantitative analysis of signal transduction since this parameter can be measured with high reliability. We show that cholesterol lowering particularly inhibits signal transduction via GPI-anchored proteins, whereas no changes were found in the distribution of these proteins in detergent-insoluble membrane domains.

Bernard, respectively); F(ab′)2-fragments of goat-anti-mouse (GAM) IgG (Sigma or Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab′)2-fragments of GAM Ig (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab′)2-fragments of GAM IgG (Accurate Chemical & Science Corp., Westbury, NY), GAM IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). The human T cell line Jurkat E6–1 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) was grown under standard conditions in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin/streptomycin (50 units/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively, Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO2. For modifications of cellular lipids, cells were incubated for 3 days in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 1 mg/liter transferrin, 8.1 mg/liter monothioglycerol, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics as above (40Stulnig T.M. Bühler E. Böck G. Kirchebner C. Schönitzer D. Wick G. J. Gerontol. 1995; 50A: B383-B390Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cellular cholesterol synthesis was blocked by addition of 2 μm lovastatin (Merck), an inhibitor of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, or squalestatin 1 (50 μg/ml) (Glaxo Wellcome), an inhibitor of squalene synthase, both generous gifts from the respective companies. The drugs were added to the culture medium from stock solutions in double distilled water (for squalestatin), or dimethyl sulfoxide (maximal solvent concentration 0.2%), respectively. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used as solvent control instead of lovastatin and had no effect on signal transduction (not shown). Sodium mevalonate was generated from mevalonolactone (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland) by hydrolysis in NaOH. Cell viability was >90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion, and since INDO-1 also served as a vital dye only living cells were assessed with respect to their calcium response. Jurkat cells were labeled with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator indo-1-AM (2 μm) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in serum-free culture medium. Cells were primed with about 10 μg of antibodies to GPI-anchored proteins or Hanks'-buffered salt solution including 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min followed by a 7 min preequilibration period at 37 °C. Subsequently, measurement of [Ca2+]i by flow cytometry was started at 37 °C constant temperature, and after 60 s 20 μg cross-linking F(ab′)2-fragments of GAM IgG were added and measurement continued for another 5 min unless stated otherwise. For CD3 stimulation 2 μg of OKT3 was added directly without cross-linking. Cross-linking did not result in a strong calcium response in any OKT3 concentration with absence of calcium response by adding the primary antibody solely. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACStarplus (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using excitation by argon laser with 50-milliwatt multiline UV, emission 530 nm (Fl1, calcium-free indo-1) and 395 nm (Fl2, calcium bound form). The fluorescence ratio Fl2/Fl1 (FR), which is a direct estimate of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration (41Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was computed in real time by a pulse processing unit and expressed as arbitrary units. The FR of the unstimulated control (FRus) was set to about 200 arbitrary units. For quantitation of stimulation, maximal FR was measured at 1–3 min after adding the stimulating antibody. Since CD3 stimulation of cells often induced a calcium response somewhat higher than stimulation via GPI-anchored proteins, results from modified cells were usually expressed as percentage of that achieved with the solvent control to allow comparability: relative stimulation in percent of control was calculated as (FRs - FRus)/(FRco - FRus) × 100%, with FRco representing FR of the solvent control, and FRs representing FR of the sample. Data are presented as means ± S.D. unless stated otherwise. Cells were prepared for stimulation of calcium response as described above. After preequilibration, SKF 96365 hydrochloride (Calbiochem) was added at optimal concentration (100 μm) to completely inhibit calcium entry from the medium (42Chung S.C. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Two min afterward, cells were stimulated by antibodies as described, and changes in cytoplasmic calcium concentration were determined by flow cytometry over a 3-min period. 106 cells were treated with 0.5 units of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Boehringer Mannheim) for 60 min at 37 °C in Hanks'-buffered salt solution including 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were simultaneously loaded with INDO-1 for subsequent analysis of calcium response. Cells were washed three times in Hanks'-buffered salt solution and lysed for 30 min on ice with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), 5 mmiodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 mm Pefabloc (both Boehringer Mannheim), 1 μm pepstatin, and 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone,N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, N-CBZ-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and quercetin. Lysates were then applied to Sepharose 4B minigel filtration columns as described earlier (26Cinek T. Horejsı́ V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2262-2270PubMed Google Scholar) with fractions 4 and 5 referring to the void volume. Aliquots of the fractions 3 to 11 were separated by 12% non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207497) Google Scholar) and blotted on nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham International, UK) using a semidry blotting system (C.B.S. Scientific Co., Inc., Del Mar, CA). Membranes were developed according to standard Western blotting procedures, and detection was performed by the chemiluminescence system from Boehringer Mannheim. Indirect immunofluorescence for cell surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins on unfixed cells was performed by standard procedures with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled second antibody for flow cytometric analysis. For microscopic examination, cells were first fixed for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde followed by 0.1m glycine before immunofluorescence staining. Photographs were taken from immunofluorescence with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled GAM Ig, since fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence faded before adequate exposure of the film (Kodak EPH1600) could be achieved. For determination of cholesterol content, 3 × 107 cells were twice extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1). Dried lipid extracts were dissolved in ethanol, and cholesterol was quantified by a commercial enzymatic colorimetric test according to the manufacturers instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). Cross-linking of GPI-anchored proteins CD59 or CD48 resulted in a marked rise in intracellular calcium as measured by flow cytometry (Fig.1). The signal via CD59 quantified by INDO-1 fluorescence ratio was consistently at least half of that elicited by CD3, which was used as a positive control. No calcium signal was obtained by cross-linking of antibodies directed to CD147 or CD99 molecules, which were well expressed on the Jurkat cell line used, or with isotype controls (not shown). Addition of CD59 or CD48 antibodies without cross-linking had no direct effect on the cytoplasmic calcium concentration (not shown). To test for the specificity of the calcium response for GPI-anchored proteins, cells were treated with PI-PLC to cleave the glycoproteins from their phospholipid anchor. Following treatment, CD59 or CD48 could no longer be detected on the cell surface and the calcium signal was essentially abolished, whereas surface expression and calcium response elicited via CD3 remained unchanged (Fig.2, A and B). Cellular cholesterol content was lowered by blocking endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis by lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase catalyzing the reaction to mevalonate (44Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4565) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with 2 μmlovastatin for a 3-day period decreased cellular cholesterol content by 28% compared with the solvent control (1.71 ± 0.09 nmolversus 1.24 ± 0.15 nmol/106 cells). Under the same conditions, lovastatin inhibited CD59-driven calcium response by 52 ± 9%, whereas the response via CD3 was only minimally affected (7 ± 8% inhibition; Fig.3, A and B). The inhibition by lovastatin could be reversed by added mevalonate (7.5 mm) showing that no unspecific toxicity was responsible for the drug effect. Accordingly, lovastatin did not alter calcium response of Jurkat cells when added to serum-supplemented medium (91 and 97% of solvent control for CD59 and CD3, respectively), presumably because of the presence of serum lipoproteins providing exogenous cholesterol (data not shown). Lovastatin inhibits production of mevalonate that can be further processed not only to cholesterol but also to other lipophilic products (44Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4565) Google Scholar) including farnesyl and geranylgeranyl moieties needed for prenylation of proteins, e.g. of the Ras family or G-protein γ subunits. To further prove lovastatin's inhibitory effect to be due to cholesterol lowering, squalestatin 1, an inhibitor of the squalene synthase, was also tested for its effect on signal transduction via GPI-anchored proteins. Squalestatin 1 blocks cholesterol biosynthesis at a step distal to mevalonate synthesis and, therefore, does not affect side products of the mevalonate pathway (45Thelin A. Peterson E. Hutson J.L. McCarthy A.D. Ericsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 145-149Google Scholar). Squalestatin 1 inhibited signal transduction via CD59 similarly to lovastatin (47 ± 14% inhibition; Fig.4) with minimal effect on CD3 signaling (2 ± 3% inhibition). The associated block in cholesterol synthesis downstream from mevalonate could not be reverted by mevalonate but only by cholesterol. The inhibitory effect of cholesterol depletion on calcium response is not restricted to CD59 but shared by CD48, another GPI-anchored protein (Fig. 5). Thus, inhibition by cholesterol depletion seems to be characteristic for signal transduction via GPI-anchored proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis of lovastatin-treated cells revealed no alterations in cell surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins CD59 and CD48, and CD3 (Fig. 6). The expression of at least two different epitopes on CD59 (epitope 1: MEM-43; epitope 2: MEM-43/5, MEM-125 (46Klickstein L.B. Springer T.A. Schlossman S.F. Boumsell L. Gilks W. Harlan J.M. Kishimoto T. Morimoto C. Ritz J. Shaw J. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T.F. Todd R.F. Leukocyte Typing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, Tokyo1995: 1476-1477Google Scholar)) was unaltered upon blockade of cellular cholesterol synthesis, suggesting absence of gross conformational changes of the protein part of CD59 (Fig. 6). The markedly diminished surface fluorescence detected by monoclonal antibodies MEM-125, MEM-129 (CD59), and MEM-92 (CD3) compared with other antibodies of the same antigen is due to their different isotype (IgM). Transient release of calcium from intracellular stores into the cytoplasm precedes capacitative calcium entry from the environment leading to further activation of T lymphocytes (47Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 48Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). To test whether inhibition of the release of intracellularly sequestered calcium underlies the total decrease in calcium response, cells were treated with SKF 96365 prior to stimulation. The maximal concentration of cytoplasmic calcium achieved following stimulation via GPI-anchored CD59 was decreased by about 40% after blockade of cholesterol synthesis (Fig.7 A). In contrast, stimulation via CD3 yielded no difference between lovastatin-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 7 B). Cholesterol lowering may interfere with clustering of GPI-anchored proteins and distribution in detergent-insoluble complexes. Cells fixed in formaldehyde prior to indirect immunofluorescence to avoid artificial clustering by antibodies, showed a punctate pattern of CD59 and CD48 expression (Fig.8, A and C) that was maintained after pretreatment of cells with lovastatin (Fig. 8,B and D). Investigating the impact of cholesterol depletion on the distribution of CD59 in large detergent-insoluble complexes, cells cultured with or without lovastatin were lysed in buffer containing non-ionic detergents Brij-58 or Nonidet P-40 and analyzed by size fractionation and Western blotting. Thereby most of GPI-anchored proteins CD59 and CD48 were found in large membrane complexes although after lysis with Nonidet P-40 a significant amount of CD59 was recovered in lower molecular weight fractions (Fig.9). However, the distribution of GPI-anchored proteins was identical irrespective of whether cells have been cholesterol depleted or not. Thus, the influence of cholesterol depletion on signal transduction via GPI-anchored proteins seems not to be due to destruction of GPI-anchored protein complexes.Figure 9Cholesterol lowering fails to influence distribution of GPI-anchored proteins in detergent-insoluble complexes. Jurkat T cells were incubated for 3 days in serum-free medium with (−) or without (+) 2 μm lovastatin as indicated. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% of the non-ionic detergent Brij-58 or Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), respectively. Subsequently, detergent-insoluble complexes were separated by minigel chromatography with fractions 4 and 5 corresponding to the void volume and with IgM and IgG eluting in fractions 7 and 9, respectively (26Cinek T. Horejsı́ V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2262-2270PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins of each fraction were separated by non-reducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by Western blotting with antibodies against CD59 (MEM-43/5) or CD48 (MEM-102) as indicated. Results from one of three independent analyses are depicted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The obtained data show that cholesterol lowering in living cells by metabolic intervention effectively inhibits signal transduction via GPI-anchored proteins without changing their clustering or distribution in large detergent-insoluble complexes. In contrast, signaling via the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex was hardly affected by cholesterol deprivation. Since GPI-anchored proteins lack a transmembrane domain, the clustering of these proteins to specific membrane regions seems to be prerequisite for signal transduction. Cholesterol is an essential component for the formation of these detergent-insoluble complexes (5van den Berg C.W. Cinek T. Hallett M.B. Horejsi V. Morgan B.P. J.

A. 1996; 93: 6053-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been shown that exogenously added fluorescent CD59 needs to aggregate into clusters before signal transduction is enabled (5van den Berg C.W. Cinek T. Hallett M.B. Horejsi V. Morgan B.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Lowering cholesterol by 60% in living epithelial cells by blocking its endogenous synthesis resulted in strong inhibition of folate uptake via the GPI-linked folate receptor along with variable differences in clustering of these receptors (50Chang W.J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In our study, reduction in lymphocyte cholesterol content by about 30% did not disclose any alterations in the distribution of GPI-anchored proteins when examined by immunofluorescence or gel filtration of membrane complexes. In addition, lowering cell cholesterol had no influence on overall cell surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins as quantitated by flow cytometry in contrast to previous publications (51Muller C.P. Stephany D.A. Shinitzky M. Wunderlich J.R. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 1356-1362PubMed Google Scholar, 52Esfahani M. Bigler R.D. Alfieri J.L. Lund-Katz S. Baum J.D. Scerbo L. Biochim. Biophys.

Though delipidation may cause some conformational changes in GPI-anchored proteins (54Barboni E. Rivero B.P. George A.J.T. Martin S.R. Renouf D.V. Hounsell E.F. Barber P.C. Morris R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 487-497PubMed Google Scholar) this seems to be unlikely in our experiments, since antibodies against at least two different epitopes on CD59 (46Klickstein L.B. Springer T.A. Schlossman S.F. Boumsell L. Gilks W. Harlan J.M. Kishimoto T. Morimoto C. Ritz J. Shaw J. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T.F. Todd R.F. Leukocyte Typing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, Tokyo1995: 1476-1477Google Scholar) bound to cholesterol-depleted and control cells to a similar extent (Fig. 5). Thus, in contrast to rather harsh treatments with sterol-sequestrating detergents, which are able to destroy detergent-insoluble complexesin situ (5van den Berg C.W. Cinek T. Hallett M.B. Horejsi V. Morgan B.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the signal-transducing function of these proteins seems to be particularly sensitive to a disturbed cholesterol availability. Although GPI-anchored proteins partly share signaling events with the TCR, there may be unique steps in the signaling pathways for either type of activation. Signal transduction via the TCR-CD3 complex but also distinct signaling events induced via GPI-anchored proteins including interleukin-2 secretion, CD69 expression, and activation of nuclear factor-κB, require expression of the TCR-ζ chain (14Ivanov V. Fleming T.J. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2394-2406PubMed Google Scholar,55Gunter K.C. Germain R.N. Kroczek R.A. Saito T. Yokoyama W.M. Chan C. Weiss A. Shevach E.M.

Weiss A. Shevach E.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), activation of p56lck, protein kinase C, and ERK-2, expression of CD25 (58Decker M. Ticchioni M. Mari B. Mary D. Bernard A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and inhibition of CD3-driven interleukin-2 production (57Fleming T.J. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1955-1962PubMed Google Scholar, 59Codias E.K. Fleing T.J. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1825-1832PubMed Google Scholar) were shown to be independent of the expression of TCR-ζ. Furthermore, activation of murine T cells via GPI-anchored Thy-1 but not via CD3 requires expression of p59fyn (60Lancki D.W. Qian D. Fields P. Gajewski T. Fitch F.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4363-4370PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, signaling via GPI-anchored proteins seems to differ from TCR/CD3 signaling with regard to the involvement of the TCR-ζ chain and particular Src protein kinases. Despite these differences, both signaling pathways were shown to interact with each other since adequate expression of GPI-anchored proteins is needed for signaling via the TCR-CD3 complex (61Malek T.R. Fleming T.J. Codias E.K. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 62Lee S.K. Su B. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2167-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It appears from this that T cell activation via GPI-anchored proteins differs from TCR/CD3-driven activation, and each pathway may require components of the other for optimal stimulation (2Robinson P.J. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 35-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 61Malek T.R. Fleming T.J. Codias E.K. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our findings, that activation of calcium response in T cells via GPI-anchored proteins and the TCR is differentially affected by cholesterol depletion, supports the concept of separate signaling pathways to be involved. Moreover, since activation via CD59 and CD48 were suppressed to a similar extent, cholesterol lowering seems to impair signaling pathways common to GPI-anchored proteins. Absence of structural homologies between both GPI-linked molecules beyond the phospholipid anchor suggests that the GPI-anchor itself could play an important role in signal transduction via these proteins, as proposed previously by others (30Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Kwong J. Fujita T. Olszowy M.W. Shaw A.S. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3535-3541PubMed Google Scholar, 61Malek T.R. Fleming T.J. Codias E.K. Semin.

Rescue by appropriate downstream products of cholesterol synthesis proves that the drugs applied are actually effective via inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. Such inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum may directly interfere with more subtle associations of lipids and proteins during aggregation to detergent-insoluble complexes. How a disturbed lipid composition can alter the signal transduction process remains to be elucidated. Conceivably, spatial relationships between GPI-anchored proteins and candidate signal-transducing molecules like the Src family protein tyrosine kinases could play a role in this process as well as changes in lateral mobility of components within the complexes. In conclusion, our data suggest that cholesterol lowering affects signal transduction via GPI-anchored proteins in a very early stage up to the release of calcium without apparent structural alterations. Thus, lipids may play an intriguing role in signal transduction via these surface molecules whose exact molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We are grateful to Samuel Godár and Dr. Winfried Pickl for helpful discussions, and to Dr. Otto Majdic for the provision of antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1966593481,"Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was inactivated byS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide donor (Asahi, M., Fujii, J., Suzuki, K., Seo, H. G., Kuzuya, T., Hori, M., Tada, M., Fujii, S., and Taniguchi, N. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 21035–21039). The structural basis of the inactivation was studied. We also show that 3-morpholinosydnonimine N-ethylcarbamide, a peroxynitrite precursor, as well as synthetic peroxynitrite also inactivated bovine GPx. The degree of incorporation of a sulfhydryl reagent,n-octyldithionitrobenzoic acid, into GPx decreased after pretreatment with SNAP as evidenced by mass spectrometry. To identify the modification site of this enzyme by SNAP, both SNAP-pretreated and untreated GPxs were reacted with n-octyldithionitrobenzoic acid and digested with lysylendopeptidase, and the resulting peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry. This technique identified a bridge between two peptides, one of which contains Sec45 at the catalytic center and Cys74, and the other contains Cys91. Although there are two possible combinations, selenocysteine 45 (Sec45) and Cys91 or Cys74 and Cys91, the tertiary structure of GPx indicates that a cross-link between Sec45 and Cys91 is more feasible. This is consistent with the experimental evidence that SNAP specifically inactivates GPx, in which Sec45 forms the catalytic center. Thus, we conclude that SNAP mainly oxidized Sec45 to form a selenenyl sulfide (Se-S) with a free thiol, leading to the inactivation of the enzyme. These data suggest that nitric oxide and its derivatives directly inactivate GPx in a specific manner via the production of a selenenyl sulfide, resulting in an increase in intracellular peroxides that are responsible for cellular damage. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was inactivated byS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide donor (Asahi, M., Fujii, J., Suzuki, K., Seo, H. G., Kuzuya, T., Hori, M., Tada, M., Fujii, S., and Taniguchi, N. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 21035–21039). The structural basis of the inactivation was studied. We also show that 3-morpholinosydnonimine N-ethylcarbamide, a peroxynitrite precursor, as well as synthetic peroxynitrite also inactivated bovine GPx. The degree of incorporation of a sulfhydryl reagent,n-octyldithionitrobenzoic acid, into GPx decreased after pretreatment with SNAP as evidenced by mass spectrometry. To identify the modification site of this enzyme by SNAP, both SNAP-pretreated and untreated GPxs were reacted with n-octyldithionitrobenzoic acid and digested with lysylendopeptidase, and the resulting peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry. This technique identified a bridge between two peptides, one of which contains Sec45 at the catalytic center and Cys74, and the other contains Cys91. Although there are two possible combinations, selenocysteine 45 (Sec45) and Cys91 or Cys74 and Cys91, the tertiary structure of GPx indicates that a cross-link between Sec45 and Cys91 is more feasible. This is consistent with the experimental evidence that SNAP specifically inactivates GPx, in which Sec45 forms the catalytic center. Thus, we conclude that SNAP mainly oxidized Sec45 to form a selenenyl sulfide (Se-S) with a free thiol, leading to the inactivation of the enzyme. These data suggest that nitric oxide and its derivatives directly inactivate GPx in a specific manner via the production of a selenenyl sulfide, resulting in an increase in intracellular peroxides that are responsible for cellular damage.

Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of NO is very short, however, in vivo because it easily reacts with molecular oxygen and other reactive oxygen species as well as free thiols in, for example, glutathione and proteins to form nitrosothiols. Nitrosothiols functionally mimic NO and are also thought to play an important role in vivo (2Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc.

Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of formation of peroxynitrite is approximately 30-fold faster than the reaction of NO with oxyhemoglobin and 3-fold faster than the reaction of superoxide with superoxide dismutase (11Huie R.E. Padjama S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). Stimulated macrophage (12Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem.

Recent data have provided evidence for the in vivo formation of peroxynitrite in human atherosclerotic coronary vessels (15Beckman J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M.A. Tarpey M.M.

The produced peroxynitrite induces protein modifications by a mechanism that is different from that for reactive oxygen species or NO in that it rapidly reacts with tryptophan and tyrosine as well as cysteine and induces the formation of protein carbonyl groups (18Ischiropoulos H. Al-Mehdi A.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The oxidative modification of proteins, including enzymes by peroxynitrite, causes protein fragmentation and thus alters enzyme activity and in addition induces many injury processes associated with oxidative biological damage (19Stadtman E.R. Paoletti R. Samuelsson B. Catapano A.L. Poli A. Rinetti M. Oxidative Processes and Antioxidants. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 117-134Google Scholar, 20Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a potent anti-oxidative enzyme, scavenges various peroxides. Overexpression of this enzyme was observed to suppress reactive oxygen-induced apoptosis in a variety of cells, suggesting that the inhibition of this enzyme is closely related to apoptotic cell death (21Hockenbery D.M.

Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GPx contains a rare amino acid, selenocysteine, which is essential for peroxidase activity (23Tappel A.L. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1984; 24: 87-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rocher C. Lalanne J.-L. Chaudiere J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This selenocysteine residue resembles a cysteine residue in terms of chemical properties but has a higher reactivity (25Huber R.E. Criddle R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 122: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 26Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In prior studies in this laboratory, we have examined the effects of oxidants, on the inactivation of GPx and recently have shown (27Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21035-21039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) that treatment of GPx withS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide precursor, results in its inactivation. SNAP appears to inactivate GPx in a complex manner involving two discrete steps. The first step appears to be reversible, and during this step dithiothreitol can recover its activity, whereas the second step is irreversible. Because peroxynitrite is a much more potent oxidant than NO (28Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar), it is possible that GPx is also inactivated by peroxynitrite. This paper reports a further characterization of the mechanism of inactivation of GPx by NO and a determination of the specific site of GPx, which is oxidized and results in inactivation. Experiments were also carried out using SIN-1, a precursor of peroxynitrite, to investigate the nature of this oxidant on the inactivation of the enzyme. Bovine intracellular GPx was purchased from Toyobo Co. Ltd. ODNB was obtained from Fluka. SNAP and DTT were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co. Ltd. SIN-1 was obtained from Dojin. Lysylendopeptidase and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (FLUOS) were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Peroxynitrite was prepared by the method of Beckman et al. (30Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 50 mm sodium nitrite was added to an equivalent amount of hydrogen peroxide in 1 n HCl, and the pH of the solution was then immediately adjusted to 10 by the addition of 1.2n sodium hydroxide. Concentrations of peroxynitrite were determined by its absorption at 302 nm (1,670 mol−1 cm−1). Free thiols and selenol were modified by ODNB as described by Faulstich et al. (31Faulstich H. Tews P. Heintz D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ODNB is a reagent that reacts with free thiols and selenols in protein more rapidly than Ellman's reagent. To convert all the purified GPx into its active form, the GPx in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was reduced with DTT. After incubation with 5 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C, DTT was separated from the GPx using a PD-10 column, a G-25 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The reduced, active GPx was first incubated with or without 1 mm SNAP, a donor of NO+ and NO− as well as ⋅NO (32Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) in the same buffer as the above at 37 °C for 1 h and then reacted with a 20-fold excess ODNB for 30 min at room temperature. To protect GPx from spontaneous oxidation by air, the sample solution was flushed with N2 during the reaction. GPx was treated with and without SNAP and then modified with ODNB, designated as NO-GPx-ODNB and GPx-ODNB, respectively, and was used for further experiments. GPx molecules and peptides derived from GPx by digestion with lysylendopeptidase were separated by RP-HPLC (Waters) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml using a 150 × 4.6-mm I.D. Develosil 300 C4-HG-5 column and a 150 × 4.6-mm I.D. Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (Nomura chemical, Aichi, Japan), respectively. A gradient system formed between solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) was used. Positive ion MALDI-TOF-MS was performed using a Voyager-RP or Voyager-Elite time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer equipped with a delayed-extraction system (PerSeptive Biosystems, Flamingham, MA) as described previously (33Takao T. Tambara Y. Nakamura A. Yoshino K. Fukuda H. Fukuda M. Shimonishi Y. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 637-640Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Solutions (1 μl) containing the GPx molecules fractionated by RP-HPLC or the lysylendopeptidase digests were placed on the flat surface of a stainless steel plate and mixed with the matrix solution, and the supernatant of 50 or 33% acetonitrile solution was saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid or sinapinic acid, respectively, and air dried. The ions were generated by irradiating the sample area with the output of a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Positive ion electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were obtained using a JMS-HX/HX110A four-sector tandem mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo) equipped with an ESI source (Analytica of Branford, Branford, CT). The mass spectra were acquired in the range ofm/z 300–2500 with a mass resolution of 1000. Solutions of analytes were infused into the ESI source with a Harvard syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, MA) at a flow rate of 1.0 μl/min. All other details involved methodology reported previously (34Murata H. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 8: 205-210Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Intact GPx, GPx-ODNB, and NO-GPx-ODNB in 20 μl of 0.5 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 4 m urea were treated with lysylendopeptidase for 16 h at 37 °C at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/100 (w/w). Aliquots of each protein digest were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE or MALDI-TOF-MS. The remaining portions of the digests were applied to a C-18 column in RP-HPLC. The molecular masses of fractionated peptide fragments were examined by ESI-MS, and the amino acid sequences were assigned using the data obtained. Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in the presence or the absence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. GPx activity was determined according to the method of Lawrence and Burk (36Lawrence R.A. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 0.5 μmol of NADPH (corresponding to 1 μmol of reduced glutathione) per min. Manganese-superoxide dismutase was purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and butyl-Toyopearl as described previously (37Matsuda Y. Suzuki K. Ookawara T. Nakata T. Seo H.G. Kawata S. Tarui S. Deutsch H.F. Taniguchi N. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To identify the peptides modified with SNAP, the lysylendopeptidase digests were first incubated with the fluorescent probe, FLUOS, to amplify the signal derived from peptide bands (38Vigers G.P.A. Coue M. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1011-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and then subjected to 20% SDS-PAGE. The bands were detected by a fluorescein image analyzer (FluorImager SI, Molecular Dynamics). The paired Student's ttest was used to compare the significance of the differences between data. We have previously shown that GPx is inactivated by SNAP treatment more specifically than glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in vitro (27Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21035-21039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the inactivation of GPx by peroxynitrite, which is a more potent oxidant than NO, and the reversibility of the inactivation. When we examined the effects of SIN-1, a precursor of peroxynitrite that generates both ⋅NO and superoxide (39Feelisch M. Ostrowski J. Noack E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 14: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), we found that GPx was inactivated by SIN-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 a). To determine the actual molecule that attacks GPx, we examined the effects of manganese-superoxide dismutase on the inactivation of GPx by SIN-1 or SNAP (Fig. 1 b). The inhibition by SIN-1 was reduced by manganese-superoxide dismutase, whereas that by SNAP was essentially unchanged. This suggests that peroxynitrite is involved in SIN-1-mediated inactivation, but not by SNAP. Because superoxide also inhibits GPx at high concentration (40Blum J. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), the effect of synthetic peroxynitrite was also examined. The results (Fig. 2) confirm that the inactivation is induced by active peroxynitrite and is irreversible by 5 mm DTT. A decomposition product derived from it did not induce the inactivation.Figure 2Irreversible inactivation of GPx by synthetic peroxynitrite. Purified GPx (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 100 μm synthetic peroxynitrite (ONOO−) at room temperature for 10 min. After further incubation with or without 5 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C, enzyme activity was determined after appropriate dilution with assay buffer. Peroxynitrite was allowed to decompose for 5 min in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) before the addition to GPx (ONOO− (decomposed)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The facts that the activity of SNAP-inhibited GPx can be partially recovered by brief incubation with DTT and that this reversibility is diminished after prolonged incubation with SNAP (27Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21035-21039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) suggest that the mechanism by which GPx is inactivated is a multistep process. Because nitroso-GPx cannot be detected by NMR (27Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21035-21039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the intermediate may not be as stable as that found for the case of serum albumin (2Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Because NO is known to be an oxidant, it may mediate oxidation, possibly of cysteine side chains or selenocysteine residues. We then incubated GPx with or without 1 mm SNAP and further reacted the samples with ODNB, a sulfhydryl reagent, to quantitate the free SH or SeH residues in GPx. GPx treated with the above reagents was eluted from the C-4 column in the order of intact GPx > NO-GPx-ODNB > GPx-ODNB (Fig.3), which suggests differences in the amount of ODNB attached to GPx, because this reagent gives molecular species of increasing hydrophobicity. These same molecular species also displayed slightly different electrophoretic mobilities on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4). In addition, NO-GPx-ODNB (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8) gave two bands, along with a broad smear in the high molecular weight region. Under reducing conditions, this complex mixture reverted to a single band, corresponding to 22 kDa (Fig. 4). The result implies that modification of GPx by SNAP occurs in part at some specific ODNB-reactive site, that is, at free thiol or selenol groups in the GPx.Figure 4SDS-PAGE analysis of intact GPx, NO-GPx-ODNB, and GPx-ODNB. 5 μg of intact GPx (lanes 1 and5), GPx-ODNB (lanes 2 and 6), NO-GPx-ODNB were seperated on a 15% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. NO-GPx-ODNB was prepared by incubation with SNAP for 30 min (lanes 3 and 7) or for 1 h (lanes 4 and 8). Samples were preincubated in the presence (lanes 1–4) or the absence (lanes 5–8) of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) before electrophoresis.Lanes M, markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the number of ODNB molecules incorporated into each GPx, the fractions obtained by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3) were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS. Intact GPx gave a relatively broad molecular ion peak, the center of which corresponds to m/z 21,575 as MH+, which is close to the value (21,586) calculated from the amino acid sequence (5–198) of GPx (see Fig. 6 b) (41Gunzler, W. A., Steffens, G. J., Grossmann, A.,. Kim, S. A, Otting, F., Wendel, A., and Flohe, L. (1984) Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. , 365, (Suppl.) 195–212.Google Scholar). The broadening of the molecular ion peak can be attributed to the heterogeneity of the N-terminal portion of GPx, which was verified by N-terminal sequence analysis of intact GPx (data not shown) and should have caused a slightly larger error in mass than expected. The NO-GPx-ODNB and GPx-ODNB samples showed molecular ion peaks atm/z 22,004 and 22246, respectively, which are larger than the observed mass (21Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar, 575) of the intact GPx by 429 and 671. The increased values are consistent with the incorporation of three and five n-octane-1-thiol, respectively, derived from ODNB into GPx treated with and without SNAP. These results strongly suggest that two thiol or selenol residues were modified by SNAP treatment, preventing them from reacting with ODNB. To identify the modification site in GPx treated with SNAP, GPx-ODNB and NO-GPx-ODNB were digested with lysylendopeptidase and then fractionated by RP-HPLC using a C-18 column. Eight peptides were produced from GPx-ODNB by lysylendopeptidase digestion (see Fig. 6 a). The observed molecular weights obtained by ESI-MS of these fractions allowed the complete identification of bovine GPx (see Fig. 6 b). It should be noted that peak 1, which contains the N-terminal peptide fragment gave several molecular ion signals in ESI-MS (data not shown), all of which were assigned to the N-terminally truncated peptides but predominantly to the peptides (Ala5–Lys34 and Ala6–Lys34) as depicted in Fig. 6 b. These data are consistent with the observation of the relatively broad ion peak for the intact GPx (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the recoveries of peptides 2 and 3 in the digest of NO-GPx-ODNB were decreased, relative to the remainder of the peptides that were obtained with similar intensities to those observed for GPx-ODNB (Fig. 6 a). This suggests that cross-linking through disulfide or selenenyl sulfide occurs between Sec45 or Cys74 in peptide 2 and Cys91 in peptide 3 by SNAP treatment, although a cross-linked peptide has not been eluted from the reverse-phase column under the present conditions. To examine the presence of high molecular weight cross-linked peptides in the digest, it was directly subjected to SDS-PAGE modified for the separation of relatively low molecular weight proteins, which allows separations ranging from 3 to 10 kDa (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 7). Although the lysylendopeptidase digest of GPx-ODNB showed two bands of approximately 5 kDa, which may correspond to the two large fragments (peptides 2 and 8, Fig.6 b) of GPx (Fig. 7, lane 2), the digest of NO-GPx-ODNB gave an additional electrophoretic band at a position between bovine insulin (5.7 kDa) and horse cytochrome c(12.2 kDa) (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4), which could correspond to a cross-linked fragment that was not eluted from the reverse-phase column. To further identify the cross-linked fragment in NO-GPx-ODNB, the digest was subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS. The molecular ion signals observed for the digests of GPx-ODNB and NO-GPx-ODNB could be correlated to the amino acid sequence. The N-terminal peptides gave a series of ions, which correspond to the amino acid sequence truncated at the N terminus. The result agreed with the observation of the relatively broad signals in MALDI-TOF-MS of intact GPx (Fig. 5). With respect to the elution of the high molecular weight peptide around 7 kDa for NO-GPx-ODNB in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and4), MALDI-TOF-MS indicated a molecular weight ofm/z 6839.9, which was not observed in the spectrum of GPx-ODNB (Fig. 8). This value is consistent with the sum of peptides 2 and 3. Collectively, these data indicate that Sec45 or Cys74 in peptide 2 and Cys91 in peptide 3 were cross-linked via Se-S or S-S bridges in NO-GPx-ODNB in a specific manner. We previously reported the inactivation of purified bovine GPx by SNAP and cellular GPx by endogenously produced NO via induction of NOS II (27Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21035-21039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that GPx was also inactivated by both SIN-1 and peroxynitrite, a more potent oxidant than NO (28Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy in this respect that recent reports also demonstrate that aconitase, an enzyme in Krebs cycle and well known as a target of NO, was inactivated by peroxynitrite more strongly than NO (42Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aconitase has an iron-sulfur cluster at the active center, and the inactivation by peroxynitrite is caused by binding to ferrous ion. However, the inactivation mechanism of GPx would be expected to be different from that of aconitase. Because GPx has an essential selenocysteine residue in its active center, which would form a transient selenenyl sulfide with substrate reduced glutathione during the catalytic cycle, nitrososelenocysteine or selenenyl sulfide formation of the residue would lead to inactivation. Although SNAP-mediated inactivation involves reversible and irreversible steps (27Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21035-21039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), peroxynitrite mediated only irreversible inactivation (Fig. 2), suggesting that the oxidation of the essential thiols or selenol is a cause of the inactivation. Whereas S-nitrosothiols and SNAP act as NO+, ⋅NO, and NO− donors under physiological conditions (29Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar), NO+ would be predicted to be the actual effector molecule that inhibits GPx because NO+binds strongly to thiol groups (44Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28158-28164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 45Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). That the essential selenocysteine residue in the active center of GPx binds NO+ and is then oxidized to form a selenenyl sulfide is a reasonable hypothesis. Peroxynitrite would mediate only selenenyl sulfide formation by its strong oxidant activity. Although there is a report showing that NO does not inactivate GPx (46Farias-Eisner R. Chaudhuri G. Aeberhard E. Fukuto J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6144-6151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the authentic NO and NO donor used in that study would provide ⋅NO but not NO+. This might lead to a different conclusion because NO+ has a much higher reactivity with respect to thiol and selenol. Mass spectrometry proved to be a useful technique for the identification of the residues involved in the inactivation of GPx by SNAP. The data indicate that selenocysteine residue (Sec45) or cysteine residue (Cys74) are the residues that are oxidized. Despite of the difference in chemical characteristics between Se-S and S-S bonds, any method to definitely distinguish them has not been reported. However, because a selenol is more easily oxidized than a thiol, Sec45 may well represent the specific oxidative site. The formation of a smear on electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 4also indicates an additional nonspecific oxidative site. Based on selenol reactivity, Sec45 could also be involved in these nonspecific bridges. Destruction of the catalytic center via the formation of a selenenyl sulfide may cause irreversible inactivation of this enzyme. The specific cross-link between Sec45 and Cys91 observed in the present study could be well explained by the evidence that the atomic distance between Se of Sec45 and S of Cys91 in the tertiary structure is 134.2 nm, which is in sufficiently close proximity to allow the formation of a selenenyl sulfide (47Epp O. Ladenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Only a few reports that demonstrate NO-mediated modification directly by identifying specific sites have appeared (7Caselli A. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pazzagli L. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24878-24882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation induced by ⋅NO under anaerobic conditions would be expected to proceed via a different pathway. Reaction of NO with the free thiol group of human serum albumin yields a sulfenic acid (R-S-OH) and nitrous oxide (N2O) under anaerobic conditions (48DeMaster E.G. Quast B.J. Redfern B. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11494-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that human serum albumin with a sulfenic acid (R-S-OH) reacts with reduced glutathione or Cys to form mixed disulfides in plasma. Sulfenic acid is rather stable in human serum albumin because it is derived from the only free thiol group in the molecule. However, GPx has one SeH and 4 SH residues, which would accelerate oxidative linkage between the residues, especially between Sec45 and Cys91. The following schemes may explain the oxidative linkage between the residues under physiological conditions (E; GPx).E*/SH\SeH+2·NO→E/SH\SeOH+N2OEquation 1 E/SeH*\SeOH→E*/*\S‖Se+H2OEquation 2 E/SH\SeH+2·NO→E/*\S‖Se+N2O+H2OEquation 3 Thus, for the case of GPx, the selenenic acid residue would easily react with a thiol in the molecule to form a selenenyl sulfide, at which point GPx undergoes irreversible inactivation. Although this work was carried out under aerobic conditions, similar cross-linking would occur in GPx in vivo where oxygen pressure is very low. Recent reports demonstrated that oxidative stress is one of the direct causes of apoptotic cell death and that GPx, as well as bcl2, a proto-oncogene that blocks apoptotic cell death in multiple contexts, can prevent apoptosis (21Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species also participate in many cellular events, including signal transduction by growth factors. Hence, the destruction of balance between oxidants and antioxidants by reactive nitrogen species such as NO and peroxynitrite through inhibition of GPx could easily affect cellular homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2054088267,"Abstract Integrins are a family of heterodimeric adhesion receptors that mediate cellular interactions with a range of matrix components and cell surface proteins. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is an endothelial cell ligand for two leukocyte integrins (α4β1 and α4β7). A related CAM, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) is recognized by α4β7 but is a poor ligand for α4β1. Previous studies have revealed that all α4 integrin-ligand interactions are dependent on a key acidic ligand motif centered on the CAM domain 1 C-D loop region. By generating VCAM-1/MAdCAM-1 chimeras and testing recombinant proteins in cell adhesion assays we have found that α4β1 binds to the MAdCAM-1 adhesion motif when present in VCAM-1, but not when the VCAM-1 motif was present in MAdCAM-1, suggesting that this region does not contain all of the information necessary to determine integrin binding specificity. To characterize integrin-CAM specificity further we measured α4β1 and α4β7 binding to a comprehensive set of mutant VCAM-1 constructs containing amino acid substitutions within the predicted integrin adhesion face. These data revealed the presence of key “regulatory residues” adjacent to integrin contact sites and an important difference in the “footprint” of α4β1 and α4β7 that was associated with an accessory binding site located in VCAM-1 Ig domain 2. The analogous region in MAdCAM-1 is markedly different in size and sequence and when mutated abolishes integrin binding activity."

The baculovirus expression system employed for this study produces antithrombin which is highly similar to plasma ATIII in its inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa and which resembles the naturally occurring β-ATIII isoform in its interactions with high affinity heparin and pentasaccharide (Ersdal-Badju, E., Lu, A., Peng, X., Picard, V., Zendehrouh, P., Turk, B., Björk, I., Olson, S. T., and Bock, S. C. (1995) Biochem. J. 310, 323–330). Relative heparin affinities of basic-to-Ala substitution mutants were determined by NaCl gradient elution from heparin columns. The data show that only a subset of the previously implicated basic residues are critical for binding to heparin. The key heparin binding residues, Lys-11, Arg-13, Arg-24, Arg-47, Lys-125, Arg-129, and Arg-145, line a 50-Å long channel on the surface of ATIII. Comparisons of binding residue positions in the structure of P14-inserted ATIII and models of native antithrombin, derived from the structures of native ovalbumin and native antichymotrypsin, suggest that heparin may activate antithrombin by breaking salt bridges that stabilize its native conformation. Specifically, heparin release of intramolecular helix D-sheet B salt bridges may facilitate s123AhDEF movement and generation of an activated species that is conformationally primed for reactive loop uptake by central β-sheet A and for inhibitory complex formation. In addition to providing a structural explanation for the conformational change observed upon heparin binding to antithrombin III, differences in the affinities of native, heparin-bound, complexed, and cleaved ATIII molecules for heparin can be explained based on the identified binding site and suggest why heparin functions catalytically and is released from antithrombin upon inhibitory complex formation.

Pharmaceutical heparin is ubiquitously employed in modern medicine. Preparations of this sulfated glycosaminoglycan are given to increase anticoagulant activity in patients who have, or who are at risk for, venous and arterial thrombosis. Heparin is also used in laboratory blood sampling and in the increasingly common procedures of angioplasty, extracorporeal circulation, and hemodialysis. The anticoagulant properties of heparin derive mainly from its ability to activate the serpin antithrombin III (ATIII), 1The abbreviations used are: ATIII, antithrombin III; CA, α-carbon; aCT, antichymotrypsin; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; s4A, strand 4A; HcII, heparin cofactor II. a key inhibitor of coagulation pathway enzymes including thrombin and factor Xa. Although it has been the subject of much attention and speculation, the mechanism for heparin activation of ATIII has remained an open question due to inadequate and imprecise information about the heparin binding site. This communication reports experiments that provide a high resolution definition of the ATIII heparin binding site and proposes a mechanism for ATIII heparin cofactor activity that is based on the new data and on information from several recently solved serpin crystal structures. ATIII is a member of the serpin gene family (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) and uses a serpin-type protease inhibitor mechanism (2Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M.

Covalent inhibitor-enzyme complexes form when the P1 residue of a substrate-like sequence in the protruding reactive loop of a serpin interacts with the active site of its target enzyme. Proteinase inhibitor function depends critically on mobility of the reactive loop, and in particular on its ability to stably insert into central β-sheet A during complex formation with target enzymes. Serpins in complex with their target proteinases are inferred to have their reactive loops partially inserted into their A-sheets as strand 4A (s4A) (3Skriver K. Wikoff W.R. Patson P.A. Tausk F.

Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the conformational change associated with reactive loop insertion and inhibition is due to movement of a well defined fragment of serpin structure, consisting of helix F and strands 1, 2, and 3 of sheet A on joints formed by helices D and E. This s123AhDEF fragment moves, as a unit, away from the remainder of the serpin to open a gap between strands 3A and 5A of the native structure. It is into this gap that the reactive loop/s4A polypeptide is inserted (to varying degrees) in P14-inserted antithrombin (12Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R.

In the absence of heparin, ATIII inhibits its target enzymes at rates which are 2–3 logs lower than those observed for most other serpins in the absence of cofactors. ATIII inhibitory activity can be potentiated, however, by heparin-like molecules (15Olson S.T. Bjork I. Berliner L.J. Thrombin: Structure and Function. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 159-217Crossref Google Scholar). The physiological source of cofactor activity is heparan sulfate proteoglycans on and under the endothelium, which serve to localize and concentrate antithrombin on the vessel wall where activated coagulation enzymes are generated (16Marcum J.A. Rosenberg R.D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17de Agostini A.I. Watkins S.C. Slayter H.S. Youssoufian H. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Additionally, pharmaceutical heparin may be administered to boost the anticoagulant activity of circulating antithrombin. A well characterized highly sulfated pentasaccharide sequence (18Casu B. Oreste P. Torri G. Zopetti G. Choay J. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Sinay P. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Thunberg L. Backsrom G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 100: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 20Choay J.M.

Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pentasaccharide promotes a conformational change in ATIII which is almost fully responsible for heparin potentiation of factor Xa inhibition (21Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas heparin potentiation of thrombin inhibition requires pentasaccharide-containing molecules of at least 18 units in length to approximate ATIII and the enzyme (22Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anticoagulant pentasaccharide has 10 negatively charged sulfate and carboxylate groups. Structure/function studies with synthetic pentasaccharides have shown that six of the negatively charged groups are essential for heparin activation of ATIII and that two others play significant roles in the process (reviewed in Ref. 23van Boeckel C.A.A. Petitou M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1671-1690Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This is in general agreement with an investigation of salt effects on the binding constant between high affinity heparin and ATIII which showed that five to six charged groups directly mediate the interaction between antithrombin and its cofactor (24Nordenman B. Bjork I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 672: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast to the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide sequence of heparin, the heparin binding site of antithrombin is not precisely defined. Based on genetic variant, chemical modification, glycosylation isoform, and structural data, a cluster of positively charged residues in the helix D region has been proposed to interact with essential, negatively charged sulfate and carboxylate groups on heparin and to form the heparin binding site of ATIII (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 12Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R.

Specific interactions of ATIII and the pentasaccharide have also been proposed based on docking studies using cleaved antithrombin structures (26Grootenhuis P.D.J. van Boeckel C.A.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 2743-2747Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27van Boeckel C.A.A. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Visser A. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Mourey L. Samama J.P. Delarue M. Petitou M. Choay J. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the validity of the latter models may be questioned because cleaved ATIII has greatly reduced heparin affinity (29Bjork I. Fish W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9487-9493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, the various models of ATIII's heparin binding site have proposed that 19 different basic residues on the surface of antithrombin are involved in interactions with heparin. This number is significantly in excess of the estimated five to eight critical ionic interactions derived from studies of salt effects on the binding constant for high affinity heparin and antithrombin (24Nordenman B. Bjork I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 672: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and pentasaccharide structure/activity data (23van Boeckel C.A.A. Petitou M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1671-1690Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). ATIII is a glycoprotein with four N-glycosylation sites, and its heparin binding properties are sensitive to (i) whether oligosaccharide addition occurs at asparagine 135 (Asn135) and (ii) characteristics of the N-linked oligosaccharides that are present on the molecule. The naturally occurring β-isoform of ATIII lacks carbohydrate on asparagine 135 (30Brennan S.O. George P.M. Jordan R.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) because its NXS type consensus sequence is inefficiently glycosylated (31Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8433-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The β-isoform binds heparin more tightly than does α-isoform due to effects of the Asn135 oligosaccharide on the heparin-induced conformational change which accompanies formation of the high affinity heparin-ATIII complex (59Turk, B., Brieditis, I., Bock, S. C., Olson, S. T., and Bjork, I. (1997) Biochemistry, in press.Google Scholar). Affinity of antithrombin for heparin is also affected by characteristics of attached carbohydrates. With the exception of small differences in sialylation, complex oligosaccharides attached to the fourN-glycosylation sites of plasma-derived ATIII are identical (33Franzen L.-E. Svensson S. Larm O. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5090-5093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mizuochi T. Fujii J. Kurachi K. Kobata A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 203: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the plasma α- and β-ATIII isoforms elute cleanly from immobilized heparin. This is not the case, however, for recombinant antithrombins produced in mammalian tissue culture cells. Antithrombins expressed in BHK and CHO cell lines are heterogeneously glycosylated due to nonuniformity in host cell post-translational modification processes. This kind of glycosylation heterogeneity, in addition to α-ATIII/β-ATIII glycosylation heterogeneity caused by the wild type Asn135 NXS consensus sequence (31Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8433-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), causes the expressed antithrombin molecules to display a broad range of affinities for heparin (32Fan B. Crews B.C.

Consequently, it is problematic to determine the heparin affinities of ATIII variants produced in these expression systems, and they are not optimal for in vitro mutagenesis studies of the ATIII heparin binding site (35Bjork I. Ylinenjarvi K. Olson S.T. Hermentin P. Conrad H.S. Zettlmeissl G. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have avoided the glycosylation and heparin binding heterogeneity problems associated with production of antithrombin in cultured mammalian cells by developing a baculovirus system that expresses physically and functionally homogeneous ATIII in insect cells. α/β glycoform heterogeneity was abolished by alanine substitution of Asn135 to generate a cDNA encoding a β-like ATIII. The remaining N-glycosylation consensus sequences are uniformly modified in the lepidopteran host cells, and purified bv.hat3.N135A migrates as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing gels. Bv.hat3.N135A is highly similar to plasma ATIII in its inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa in both the absence and the presence of heparin and resembles the β-ATIII isoform in its binding to high affinity heparin and pentasaccharide (37Ersdal-Badju E.

These properties support its use as a base molecule for in vitro mutagenesis studies on the structural basis of ATIII-heparin interactions. This communication presents our initial work on alanine scanning identification of basic residues in the heparin binding site. The base molecule for this study was bv.hat3.N135A (37Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Peng X. Picard V. Zendehrouh P. Turk B. Björk I. Olson S.T. Bock S.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The N135A substitution eliminates binding heterogeneity associated with partial glycosylation of asparagine 135 (31Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8433-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and directs production of a homogeneous β-ATIII-like parent molecule with high base-line affinity for heparin (37Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Peng X. Picard V. Zendehrouh P. Turk B. Björk I. Olson S.T. Bock S.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Basic-to-Ala substitutions were introduced using a one-tube polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis method (38Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Following sequence verification and subcloning, variants were expressed as described previously (37Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Peng X. Picard V. Zendehrouh P. Turk B. Björk I. Olson S.T. Bock S.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The relative heparin affinities of variants in the basic-to-Ala substitution series were determined by binding cleared supernatants to Bio-Rad Econopak heparin cartridges and eluting with a NaCl gradient. The standard gradient was 0.7–3.1 m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA. Low affinity variants a.R47A, a.K125A and a.R129A were eluted with 0.1–1.5m NaCl. The designation a indicates that these substitutions were expressed on a bv.hat3.N135A base. ATIII presence in fractions was determined using Western blots prepared from 10% polyacrylamide Laemmli gels of reduced samples. To accurately compare elution positions of the different variants, NaCl concentrations of individual column fractions were determined by diluting aliquots 1:100 with distilled water and measuring conductivity versus a standard curve. Elution patterns for different preparations of a given variant grown under standard culture conditions (37Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Peng X. Picard V. Zendehrouh P. Turk B. Björk I. Olson S.T. Bock S.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and harvested at 80–90% host cell viability were highly reproducible. Lysates from at least two different recombinant viruses (plaques) of each variant were prepared and yielded similar results for a given substitution. Proteinase inhibitor function was checked by incubating 10-μl aliquots of variant-containing lysates with 0, 14, 35, or 175 pmol of human thrombin. After 10 min at 37 °C, reactions were subjected to non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with sheep anti-human ATIII Ig (Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) as described previously (31Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8433-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The alignment of Huber and Carrell (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) was used to identify which residues of ovalbumin and antichymotrypsin correspond to heparin binding residues of ATIII and their neighbors. For the case of antichymotrypsin, the accuracy of the Huber and Carrell alignment was verified by confirming that equivalent residues superposed in overlaid cleaved antichymotrypsin (10Baumann U. Huber R. Bode W. Grosse D. Lesjak M. Laurell C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and cleaved (28Mourey L. Samama J.P. Delarue M. Petitou M. Choay J.

An almost complete composite structure for P14-inserted antithrombin was assembled from superpositioned non-latent molecules of the independently solved human antithrombin dimer structures (12Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 13Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M.

For N-terminal segments where density is inadequate in both human structures, coordinates were extracted from the structure of cleaved bovine ATIII (28Mourey L. Samama J.P. Delarue M. Petitou M. Choay J. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which was overlaid on the P14-inserted molecules with matching for this region. Thus, the composite P14-inserted molecule used in these studies and shown in Figs. 2 and 3 consists of coordinates for (i) bovine antithrombin (28Mourey L. Samama J.P. Delarue M. Petitou M. Choay J. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) molecule A residues 5–21 and 37–46 (equivalent to human ATIII 4–20 and 36–45), (ii) pdb1ant (12Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) molecule I residues 21–29 and 46–137, and (iii) pdb1ath (13Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.D.G. Hol W.G.J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) molecule A residues 138–431. The indicated regions of pdb1ant and pdb1ath were selected to generate a composite molecule containing the C terminus of helix D (for which density is missing in pdb1ath) and the P14 region of the reactive loop (for which density is missing in pdb1ant). However, with regard to the analysis of relationships between Lys125and Arg129 and negatively charged residues in sheet B, it is noted that although the composite molecule helix D and sheet B coordinates were copied from pdb1ant and pdb1ath, respectively, Lys125, Arg129, Glu414, and Asp278 of overlaid pdb1ant and pdb1ath molecules superimpose, and the Lys125-Glu414 and Arg129-Asp278 CA distances are highly similar in the independently solved structures (see TableI).Figure 3Heparin-sensitive intramolecular salt bridges. Intramolecular salt bridges involving heparin-binding residues Lys125 and Arg129 stabilize the s123AhDEF fragment of native antithrombin in a position that disfavors reactive loop insertion. Heparin binding activates antithrombin by disrupting these salt bridges and allowing s123AhDEF to shift to a position that favors reactive loop insertion. The concept of native intramolecular salt bridges was developed from comparisons of P14-inserted ATIII with ovalbumin (A), and cleaved antichymotrypsin with native antichymotrypsin (B).A shows P14-inserted ATIII (yellow backbone withred reactive loop) overlaid on native ovalbumin (purple backbone with blue reactive loop). Bshows cleaved antichymotrypsin (yellow/red) overlaid on native antichymotrypsin (purple/blue). The s123AhDEF fragment which moves to accommodate reactive loop/s4A insertion (14Stein P.E. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) is drawn in ribbon format. Overlaid pairs have been aligned on Glu414, Asp278 (red β-carbons in central foreground) and β-sheet B to illustrate how s123AhDEF moves to the left and toward the reader upon reactive loop/s4A insertion; i.e. during the transition from the 5-stranded, native conformation to the 6-stranded, reactive loop inserted conformation, s123AhDEF moves from the position shown in purple ribbon, to the position shown in yellow ribbon. β-Carbons of residues corresponding to Lys125 and Arg129 are blue in the native structures (andsolid circles in the maps under the structures) and white in the strand 4A-inserted molecules (andopen triangles in the maps). β-Carbons of negatively charged Glu414 and Asp278 (and their corresponding residues) are red in the structures (andsolid squares in the maps). Distances between Lys125-Glu414 and Arg129-Asp278 of P14-inserted ATIII and the corresponding residues of cleaved antichymotrypsin are 2–3 Å longer than distances between the same residues of native ovalbumin and native antichymotrypsin (see Table I). From this we infer that intramolecular salt bridges (hatched lines in diagrams) connect Lys125 with Glu414, and Arg129 with Asp278 in native antithrombin, but are disrupted when the reactive loop inserts as strand 4A. The dual roles of Lys125 and Arg129 in both the binding of heparin and the native salt bridge stabilization of s123AhDEF suggest the heparin cofactor activation mechanism presented in Fig. 4. Structures used for above analysis were ovalbumin (pdb1ova, Ref. 8Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. J. Mol.

In most cases, the mutant p53 proteins are selectively recognized and bound by members of the HSP70 family of molecular chaperones, but the binding site(s) in p53 for these chaperones have not been clearly defined. We have screened a library of overlapping biotinylated peptides, spanning the entire human p53 sequence, for binding to the HSP70 proteins, Hsc70 and DnaK. We show that most of the high affinity binding sites for these proteins map to secondary structure elements, particularly β-strands, in the hydrophobic core of the central DNA binding domain, where the majority of oncogenic p53 mutations are found. Although peptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of p53 also contain potential binding sites, p53 proteins with C-terminal deletions are capable of binding to Hsc70, indicating that this region is not required for complex formation. We propose that mutations in the p53 protein alter the tertiary structure of the central DNA binding domain, thus exposing high affinity HSP70 binding sites that are cryptic in the wild-type molecule.

The wild-type p53 protein is a tumor suppressor that arrests the cell cycle in response to DNA damage through sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation of specific genes, including those encoding proteins involved in the cell cycle, in cell growth arrest after DNA damage, and in apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Levine A.J.

A variety of mutations within conserved regions of the protein disrupt the sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53, either by altering residues critical for binding or by disrupting the overall tertiary structure of the molecule (10Cho Y.

Cancer Lett. 1993; 73: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In some cases, mutant p53 proteins have also been shown to associate with the heat shock-inducible family member Hsp70 (14Pinhasi-Kimhi O. Michalovitz D. Ben-Zeev A. Oren M. Nature. 1986; 320: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 15Sturzbecher H.W. Chumakov P. Welch W.J. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 201-211PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ehrhart J.C. Duthu A. Ullrich S. Appella E. May P. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 595-603PubMed Google Scholar). HSP70 molecular chaperones perform numerous functions in cells including stabilization of newly synthesized or unfolded polypeptides, facilitation of translocation of nascent chains across membranes, mediation of the assembly or disassembly of multimeric protein complexes, and targeting of proteins for lysosomal degradation (reviewed in Refs. 17Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar, 18McKay D.B. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1993; 44: 67-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Becker J. Craig E.A. Eur. J.

These chaperone functions of HSP70 proteins are regulated and possibly targeted to different cellular locations by specific co-chaperones that are members of the DnaJ-like protein family (reviewed in Ref. 21Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Hsp40, a mammalian homologue of DnaJ, is associated with the Hsp70-p53 complex in a carcinoma cell line (22Sugito K. Yamane M. Hattori H. Hayashi Y. Tohnai I. Ueda M. Tsuchida N. Ohtsuka K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hsc70 may also cooperate with another molecular chaperone, Hsp90. In a mammary tumor cell line, both Hsc70 and Hsp90 associate with mutant p53 in the cytoplasm, but the complex dissociates upon translocation of p53 into the nucleus (23Selkirk J.K. Merrick B.A. Stackhouse B.L. He C. Appl. Theor. Electrophoresis. 1994; 4: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrate a role for Hsp90 in the achievement and/or stabilization of the mutant conformation of a p53 molecule containing a point mutation (24Blagosklonny M.V. Toretsky J. Bohen S. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8379-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Hsc70 and Hsp90 have previously been shown to function together in regulating the conformation and activity of steroid hormone receptors (reviewed in Refs. 25Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 26Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In this case, the chaperone-receptor complex dissociates upon hormone binding, exposing nuclear localization and DNA binding sites on the receptor molecule. The biological significance of the formation of HSP70-p53 complexes is unknown, although Hainaut and Milner (27Hainaut P. Milner J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3513-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) suggested that Hsc70 may play a role in the regulation of p53 conformation. Although the sites of interaction have not been clearly defined, the interaction of mutant p53 with HSP70 proteins seems to involve conserved regions within both proteins, since a mutant murine p53 has been shown to associate with DnaK, the major HSP70 family member inEscherichia coli (28Clarke C.F. Cheng K. Frey A.B. Stein R. Hinds P.W. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1206-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and Xenopus laevis p53 can bind to mammalian HSP70 proteins (29Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. Sturzbecher H.W. Ullrich S. Jenkins J. May P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various approaches have been used to identify the HSP70 binding site(s) within the p53 molecule. Deletion analysis by Sturzbecher et al. (30Sturzbecher H.W. Addison C. Jenkins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3740-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed that loss of Hsc70 binding occurred upon removal from p53 of N-terminal residues 13–66. Consistent with these results, Lam and Calderwood (31Lam K.T. Calderwood S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) identified a potential binding site within a synthetic peptide (P17G) corresponding to p53 residues 13–30, which include a highly conserved domain of p53 (Fig. 6 A). However, further experiments by Sturzbecher et al. (30Sturzbecher H.W. Addison C. Jenkins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3740-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed that a double mutant lacking residues 13–66 as well as residues 200–219 bound to Hsc70, suggesting that although amino acids 13–30 represent a potential site for Hsc70 binding, there must be additional binding sites in other regions of the molecule. We have previously shown that the peptide P17G binds to both Hsc70 and DnaK and that the major determinants for this binding are in the central region of this peptide (32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hainaut and Milner (27Hainaut P. Milner J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3513-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) suggested that the C-terminal 28 amino acids of p53 are required for association with Hsc70, because Hsc70 fails to complex with p53 mutants with alterations in these residues. However, at least one of these mutants was reported to have a wild type conformation (23Selkirk J.K. Merrick B.A. Stackhouse B.L. He C. Appl. Theor. Electrophoresis. 1994; 4: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar), so that lack of binding to Hsc70 may reflect inaccessibility of binding sites elsewhere in the molecule rather than loss of a specific site at the C terminus. Deletion of this region of p53 or binding to the bacterial HSP70, DnaK, activates the molecule for sequence-specific DNA binding, suggesting that the activation by DnaK occurs through binding to the C terminus of p53 (12Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 34Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Direct peptide binding studies defined a likely binding epitope for DnaK near the C terminus and showed that Hsc70 also recognizes this region but with lower affinity than DnaK (32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hansen S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30922-30928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We showed in addition that a peptide corresponding to a sequence in the central region of the molecule bound to both Hsc70 and DnaK (32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirm the existence of potential binding sites for HSP70 proteins in the N- and C-terminal regions of p53 but show that the great majority of high affinity sites lie in the central, DNA binding domain of the molecule. Bovine brain Hsc70 and biotinylated Hsc70 were obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies Corporation, and DnaK was obtained from Epicentre Technologies. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from KHOS-240S human osteosarcoma cells that had been heat-shocked for 2 h at 42 °C. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the culture dish, and then lysed by 20 strokes of a homogenizer in 500 μl/100-mm dish of hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (36Imamoto N.

The synthesis, N-terminal biotinylation, and sources of the peptides listed in Table I were as described previously (32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2523-2529PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Chiron Mimotopes P/L (Victoria, Australia). The library consists of 77 peptides (numbered 3–79) corresponding to overlapping 15-amino acid segments of the human p53 sequence, linked to biotin at the N terminus via an additional peptide spacer of Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly. Each peptide shares a 5-amino acid overlap in the primary p53 sequence with the previous peptide.Table IBinding of p53 peptides to HSP70 proteinsPeptide namePeptide sequenceBinding of biotin peptide to HSP701-aData are from densitometric quantitation of the bands in Fig. 1 and were normalized relative to the binding of peptide S2V10, which was designated as moderate affinity (+).

Open table in a new tab Direct binding of N-terminally biotinylated peptides or competition of binding of biotinylated peptide by excess unmodified peptides was measured as follows. Bovine Hsc70 or E. coli DnaK (1 μg/assay) was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with biotinylated p53 peptides at a final concentration of 5 or 50 μm in the absence (direct binding) or presence (competition) of a 10-fold excess of unmodified peptide in a final volume of 10 μl containing 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 75 mm KCl, and 4.5 mmMg(OAc)2. In some cases, cytoplasmic extracts containing Hsc70 and Hsp70, prepared as described above from heat-shocked human osteosarcoma cells, were incubated with biotinylated peptides at final concentrations of 50 μm. The HSP70-peptide complexes were then separated from free peptides by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; 6% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Complexes of HSP70 proteins and biotinylated peptides were visualized by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). The amount of each biotinylated peptide bound was quantitated by densitometric scanning of the bands corresponding to Hsc70 or DnaK, respectively, and expressed relative to the amount of binding to Hsc70 of peptide 28, which was included as an internal control in each separate set of assays. Human KHOS-240S osteosarcoma cells (which express a mutant form of p53 (39Romano J.W. Ehrhart J.C. Duthu A. Kim C.M. Appella E. May P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1483-1488PubMed Google Scholar)) were heat-shocked by incubation at 42 °C for 2 h and then labeled at 37 °C for 2 h with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine/100-mm culture dish. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice for 20 min in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 units/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, and 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g to remove cell debris, aliquots (80 μl) of 35S-labeled lysate were precleared by incubation with an irrelevant antibody and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Precleared extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C, either in the absence of added peptide (control) or in the presence of peptide P17G (660 μm), V10 (590 μm), or S16D (660 μm). Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody PAb240 (Oncogene Science) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by washing three times with 0.4 ml of SNNTE (5% sucrose, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5m NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmEDTA) and once with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% deoxycholate). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide) and fluorography. Wild-type human p53 and N- and C-terminal deletion mutants were translated in vitro from cDNAs cloned into pBluescript SK− (40Sang B.-C. Chen J-Y. Minna J. Barbosa M.S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 853-859PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 μl in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham, 40 μCi/translation) using the Promega TNT kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots (5 μl) of the in vitro translated35S-labeled p53 species were diluted to a final volume of 20 μl in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and 30 min at 4 °C with 1 μg of biotinylated Hsc70 (StressGen) in the absence or presence of 3 mm o-phenanthroline. Streptavidin-agarose (Sigma; 55 μl of a 20% suspension in buffer A plus 0.05% bovine serum albumin) was then added, and the mixtures were incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 45 min to facilitate the binding of the biotinylated Hsc70 molecules and any associated p53 species. The streptavidin-agarose beads were sedimented and washed three times with buffer A, and associated 35S-labeled p53 species were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide) and fluorography. Initially seven biotinylated peptides with sequences (Table I) corresponding to various segments of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins were tested for their ability to bind specifically to purified DnaK and Hsc70 or to HSP70 family members present in an extract of heat-shocked osteosarcoma cells. The nonbiotinylated versions of these peptides were previously demonstrated by other assays to bind to DnaK, Hsc70, and the endoplasmic reticulum-located HSP70 family member, BiP (32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide P17G and subpeptides P6S, T6L, and K6G correspond to sequences near the N terminus of wild-type murine p53, while peptides S16D and S10S correspond to sequences in the C-terminal region of wild-type human p53. S2V10 corresponds to a point-mutated sequence from the highly conserved region II in the central core domain of human p53 (41Caron de Fromentel C. Soussi T. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992; 4: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The N-terminally biotinylated peptides were incubated with the HSP70 proteins, and HSP70-biotin peptide complexes were separated from free biotinylated peptides by nondenaturing PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized with streptavidin peroxidase and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Three of the peptides (P6S, K6G, and S10S) showed no interaction with any of the HSP70 proteins when tested at a concentration of 50 μm (Fig. 1). The remaining four peptides all displayed significant binding to Hsc70 (which migrates as a triplet representing different oligomeric forms (Fig. 1 A)), to DnaK (which migrates as a closely spaced doublet (Fig. 1 B)), and to Hsc70 and/or Hsp70 in a cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 1 C). The specificity of binding of these biotinylated peptides to HSP70 family members was highlighted by their differential binding to the Hsc70 and Hsp70 proteins present in a complex mixture of cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 1 C). Peptides P17G and T6L bound only to Hsc70 in the cytoplasmic extract, whereas S2V10 and S16D bound to both Hsc70 and Hsp70, indicating target specificity differences even between these closely related proteins. The peptide-associated species of higher mobility than Hsc70 may represent BiP, particularly since this band was undetectable by biotin S16D binding (we have previously reported that BiP does not bind peptide S16D (32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The results obtained in these experiments are summarized in Table I, where they are compared with previous data obtained using an assay based on competition by the nonbiotinylated versions of these peptides of the binding of HSP70 proteins to reduced and carboxymethylated lactalbumin, a model unfolded polypeptide (32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two sets of data are qualitatively in good accordance. Specificity of the binding of biotinylated peptides was also tested by competition with excess unlabeled peptides (Fig. 2). Hsc70 was incubated with 50 μm biotinylated T6L, P17G, S2V10, or S16D, respectively, in the absence (−) or presence of a 10-fold excess (500 μm) of the corresponding unlabeled peptide or of peptide V10, which binds to both Hsc70 and DnaK (see Table I and Ref. 32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence has previously been shown to be presented by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on the surfaces of tumor cells expressing the mutant p53 protein (42Yanuck M. Carbone D.P. Pendleton C.D. Tsukui T. Winter S.F. Minna J.D. Berzofsky J.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3257-3261PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of each of the biotinylated peptides was specific and saturable, since it could effectively be competed by an excess of the same unlabeled peptide, or by peptide V10. Similar results were obtained for DnaK (not shown). Peptides that did not bind to the HSP70 proteins in the direct binding assay (e.g. P6S and K6G) were also unable to compete with the binding of a biotinylated peptide (data not shown). Thus, competition of biotinylated peptide binding exhibits similar specificity to direct binding. Lam and Calderwood (31Lam K.T. Calderwood S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) previously showed that excess peptide P17G could effectively compete the co-immunoprecipitation of Hsc70 and mutant p53. The data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that peptides P17G, V10, and S16D can prevent co-immunoprecipitation of both Hsc70 and Hsp70 with full-length p53 from extracts of heat-shocked osteosarcoma cells. Consistent with their relative efficacies in competing the binding of biotinylated peptides (Fig. 2), peptide P6S did not affect the association of the HSP70 proteins with full-length p53, while peptide S2V10 did interfere with this association, but with lower affinity than peptide V10 (results not shown). To identify all potential binding sites in p53 for binding to Hsc70 and DnaK, we utilized a peptide library representing the complete wild-type human p53 protein sequence. This peptide library has been used previously to identify the Mdm2 binding site in the N-terminal region of p53 (38Picksley S.M. Vojtesek B. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2523-2529PubMed Google Scholar) and to define the epitopes recognized by monoclonal anti-p53 antibodies (43Vojtesek B. Dolezalova H. Lauerova L. Svitakova M. Havlis P. Kovarik J. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 389-393PubMed Google Scholar). The library consists of 77 different peptides containing 15-residue segments of the p53 amino acid sequence (see Fig.6 B). The peptides consecutively overlap by 5 amino acids and are attached to a biotin molecule via a 4-amino acid spacer (Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly-) at the N terminus. Assays measuring the binding of the biotinylated library peptides to Hsc70 and DnaK were performed as described above for the experiment shown in Fig. 1, at peptide concentrations of both 5 and 50 μm for binding to Hsc70, and at 5 μm for binding to DnaK. The SDS-PAGE analysis of the assays performed with 5 μm peptides are shown in Fig. 4, and the results of densitometric quantification of the data are presented in Fig. 5. The analysis using 5 μm peptides showed that no high affinity sites for Hsc70 binding are present within residues 1–110 of human p53 (which are included within peptides 3–24). As discussed earlier, HSP70 binding site(s) had previously been identified within peptide P17G, which corresponds to residues 13–31 of murine p53 (Refs. 31Lam K.T. Calderwood S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). The weak binding observed with biotinylated peptides that include the corresponding residues of human p53 (peptides 5–8; see Figs. 4 and 5) suggests that the amino acid differences in the human sequence (perhaps particularly the substitution of Asp for Gly at residue 21; see TableI) result in a lower affinity interaction with Hsc70. The majority of the high affinity sites for binding to Hsc70 are contained within peptides 25–58, which include residues 111–290 of p53 and correspond to the central, highly conserved, sequence specific DNA-binding domain of the molecule (Fig. 6 A). High affinity binding was also observed for peptides 77–79, corresponding to the C-terminal 23 amino acids of p53, which contain peptide S16D (see TableI). Binding of many of the peptides corresponding to the central and C-terminal regions of p53 apparently displayed saturation at 5 μm concentration, since no further increase in binding was observed at 10-fold higher concentrations, while increased binding to Hsc70 was observed at 50 μm for some lower affinity peptides such as those corresponding to the N-terminal region corresponding to peptide P17G (data not shown). The affinities of the central and C-terminal p53 peptides are thus in the highest range previously observed for peptide binding to Hsc70, i.e. less than 10 μm (32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Identification of Hsc70- and DnaK-binding sites in human p53.

The gene product of cps14G encodes a β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for the second step in the subunit synthesis, the transfer of galactose to lipid-linked glucose. The expression of a polysaccharide capsule is a common feature of many bacterial species, particularly those causing serious invasive infections of man (1Boulnois G.J. Roberts I.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 1-18PubMed Google Scholar). The capsule confers the bacterium resistance to complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis (2Moxon E.R. Kroll J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 65-85PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some bacteria express capsular polysaccharides (CPs) 1The abbreviations used are: CP, capsular polysaccharide; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; TLC, thin layer chromatography; ORF(s), open reading frame(s); bp, base pair(s); LB, Luria-Bertani; TB, terrific broth.1The abbreviations used are: CP, capsular polysaccharide; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; TLC, thin layer chromatography; ORF(s), open reading frame(s); bp, base pair(s); LB, Luria-Bertani; TB, terrific broth.that mimic host molecules, thereby avoiding the specific immune system of the host (3Cross A.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 87-95PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial CPs are generally composed of repeating oligosaccharides, consisting of two to ten monosaccharides, sometimes complemented with other components. Because of the variable number and different types of monosaccharides within a subunit and the different ways these monosaccharides can be linked together, an enormous variety of polysaccharide structures can be formed. The speciesStreptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus), a human pathogen causing invasive diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media, comprises 90 serotypes (4Henrichsen J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2759-2762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), each one having its own specific CP. The capsule of the pneumococcus is an important virulence factor. This became clear from the observation that unencapsulated mutants lose their virulence (5Watson D.A. Musher D.M. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3135-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, antibodies directed against CPs are protective (6Bruyn G.A.W. Furth R. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1991; 10: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and this protection is serotype-specific. CPs from 23 serotypes are included in a vaccine (7Jennings H.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 97-128PubMed Google Scholar). Although this vaccine protects healthy adults against infections caused by the serotypes included in the vaccine, its efficacy is poor in high-risk groups such as young children (8Siber G.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1385-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Douglas R.M. Paton J.C. Duncan S.J. Hansman D.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 148: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The chemical structures of most pneumococcal CP types have been determined (10van Dam J.E.G. Fleer A. Snippe H. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1990; 58: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but little is known about the genes involved in CP synthesis (cps), and the biosynthesis itself. Biosynthesis should require a complex enzymatic pathway, starting with the uptake or synthesis of the monosaccharides and their activation by conversion to nucleotide derivatives. A membrane-bound transferase complex would catalyze the successive linkage of the monosaccharides to a membrane-bound lipid carrier, followed by polymerization of the subunits and subsequent export and attachment of the complete CP to the cell surface. Classic genetic experiments performed by Avery et al. (11Avery O.T. MacLeod C.M. McCarthy M. J. Exp. Med. 1944; 79: 137-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar) indicated that the cps genes are clustered on the chromosome of the pneumococcus. Recent reports by others (12Dillard J.P. Vandersea M.W. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Guidolin G. Morona J.K. Morona R. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5384-5396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ourselves (14Kolkman M.A.B. Morrison D.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Nuijten P.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) confirm this observation. Also in other bacterial species (e.g. Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae),cps genes are clustered. Between these loci, there appears to be a considerable degree of sequence homology. Moreover, they have a common genetic organization involving three functional regions (15Boulnois G.J. Jann K. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,16Kroll J.S. Zamze S. Loynds B. Moxon E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3343-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The central region encodes serotype-specific biosynthetic functions and is flanked on both sides by two conserved regions presumed to encode proteins for common functions like CP transport. Little is known about the genetic organization of cps loci in Gram-positive bacteria, including S. pneumoniae. We study the capsule biosynthesis of S. pneumoniae serotype 14, whose CP has a linear backbone of →6)-β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→3)-β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-Glcp-(1→ repeating units, with monosaccharide side chains of a β-d-Galp-(1→ linked to C4 of eachN-acetylglucosamine residue. We recently identified a chromosomal region of serotype 14 involved in CP synthesis and cloned at least a large part of the cps locus into a low copy number cosmid vector (14Kolkman M.A.B. Morrison D.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Nuijten P.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two genes, cps14E andcps14F, involved in CP synthesis were identified.Cps14E encodes a glycosyltransferase. In this communication, we report on the structure of five other genes of the serotype 14cps locus. We also determined the functions of gene products by inactivating the genes and by functional expression of these genes in E. coli. S. pneumoniae serotype 14 was strain NCTC11902. A serotype 4 strain was obtained from A. J. W. van Alphen (Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The pneumococcal strain CP1200 has been described previously (17Morrison D.A. Lacks S.A. Guild W.R. Hageman J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 281-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pneumococci were grown at 37 °C in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY-medium) or on blood agar plates. Tetracycline was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for selection of the S. pneumoniae mutants. E. coli CG120 (18Gawron-Burke C. Clewell D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159 (2nd Ed.): 214-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing pAM120, was a gift from C. G. Rubens (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). E. coli DH5α (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used as a host for pBluescript II KS (Stratagene), and all clones were grown in or on LB or TB media (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing the appropriate antibiotic concentration. Cosmid cMK02 and the plasmids pGV100, pMK100, pMK102, and pMK103 have been described before (14Kolkman M.A.B. Morrison D.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Nuijten P.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pBluescript II KS was used for subcloning of fragments from cosmid clone cMK02. Monoclonal antibody Hasp14.1 (specific for serotype 14 polysaccharide) was obtained from U. B. Skov S⊘rensen (Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark). Cloning, transformation, Southern blot analysis, and most other DNA techniques were performed as described before (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was isolated as described by Ausubelet al. (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, NY1987Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Pharmacia-LKB. High-fidelity PCR was performed withPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was sequenced using an A.L.F. DNA sequencer (Pharmacia-LKB), and sequencing data were assembled using pc/gene (IntelliGenetics). The programs TFASTA and BLAST were used to compare sequences to data bases available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda. Hydrophobic stretches within proteins were predicted by the method of Kleinet al. (21Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of cps14Bto cps14H have been deposited with GenBankTM/EBI DataBank. Construction of cps14E and cps14Fmutants has been described (14Kolkman M.A.B. Morrison D.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Nuijten P.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An insertional mutation incps14D, cps14G, and cps14H was constructed in vitro by blunt ligation of a 4.9-kilobaseHincII fragment of pAM120 containing the tetracycline resistance gene of Tn916 (tetM) in theHpaI site of cps14D in pMK104, in theSacII site of cps14G in pGV100, and in theSpeI site of cps14H in pGV100, respectively. After transformation to E. coli DH5α, clones were selected in which the direction of transcription of the tetracycline resistance gene was similar to that of the adjacent cps genes. This yielded the plasmids pKOM13, pKOM01, and pKOM08, respectively. Thecps14D, cps14G, and cps14H insertion mutation was introduced into the chromosome of the wild-type by natural transformation as described by Yother et al. (22Yother J. McDaniel L.S. Briles D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1463-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the three constructs. Pneumoccoccal strain CP1200 was used as a donor strain for competence factor. Transformants were selected for tetracycline resistance, and mutations were confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis. An in-frame deletion incps14F (from nucleotide 3564 to 3893) was introduced in plasmid pMK100REV by performing a high fidelity PCR with the primers 14FBGLP1 (5′-ATAAAGATCTATGAGTTAAATGACCTCC-3′) and 14FBGLP2 (5′-CAGGAGATCTGTACAATGGGAAGAAATG-3′), which both contain an internalBglII site, and pMK100REV as target DNA. The PCR product was digested with BglII, religated, and transformed to E. coli DH5α. The resulting plasmid of one of the clones, designated pMK113, was sequenced to confirm the in-frame deletion incps14F and to check whether any mutations were introduced into cps14E and cps14G. Pneumococcal membranes were prepared as described (14Kolkman M.A.B. Morrison D.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Nuijten P.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli membranes were isolated by the same procedure with some modifications. Cultures were grown overnight in TB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C and then diluted 10-fold in the same medium. Cells were grown to mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.4–0.6), and then expression of thecps genes was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The incubation was extended for 2 h at 37 °C and then cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 0.7 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mg of lysozyme was added, and the suspension was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The rest of the procedure was as described for pneumococcal membranes (14Kolkman M.A.B. Morrison D.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Nuijten P.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pneumococcal and E. coli membranes were stored at −70 °C and proved to be stable for several months. Glycosyltransferase activity was essentially determined as described previously (14Kolkman M.A.B. Morrison D.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Nuijten P.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each reaction, 40 μl of membrane preparation (approximately 25 μg of protein) was incubated at 10 °C for 1 h with 0.025 μCi UDP-[14C]glucose (Amersham Life Science, Inc., 296 mCi/mmol), and/or 0.025 μCi UDP-[14C]galactose (Amersham, 305 mCi/mmol), or 0.025 μCi UDP-[14C]N-acetylglusosamine (Amersham, 251 mCi/mmol) as indicated in each experiment, and 10 mmMgCl2 in a final volume of 50 μl. When indicated, unlabeled UDP-glucose was added to a final concentration of 500 μm. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml chloroform:methanol (2:1). This solution was extracted three times with 0.2 ml of PSUP (1.5 ml of chloroform, 25 ml of methanol, 23.5 ml of water, and 0.183 g of KCl). The incorporation of 14C into the glycolipid fraction in the organic phase was measured in a scintillation counter (Beckman). Lipid-linked intermediates were hydrolyzed from the lipid carriers by mild acid hydrolysis: one-fifth of the glycolipid fraction was dried in a Speed-Vac and resuspended in 100 μl of 1-butanol. 100 μl of 0.05 m trifluoroacetic acid was added, and the solution was heated for 20 min at 90 °C. The solution was dried again in a Speed-Vac, and the pellet was resuspended in 40% 2-propanol containing 5 mg/ml unlabeled carrier glucose, galactose, and lactose, and subjected to thin layer chromatography (TLC). TLC was carried out on HPTLC silica gel (Merck), developed in 1-butanol/ethanol/water (5:3:2), sprayed with En3hance spray (DuPont) and autoradiographed for 1–2 days. To visualize unlabeled sugar standards, the TLC plate was sprayed with 5% H2SO4 in ethanol and heated to 100 °C for 10 min. [14C]-labeled lactose, released by mild acid hydrolysis of the lipid carrier of wild-type pneumococcal membranes incubated with UDP-[14C]glucose and UDP-[14C]galactose, was scraped off a TLC plate and eluted in water. Half of the sample was reduced with sodium borohydride as described previously (23Kennedy E.P. Rumley M.K. Schulman H. van Golde L.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4208-4213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and desalted using a column of mixed-bed resin (IWT TMD-8, Aldrich). Both samples (reduced and unreduced lactose) were subjected to strong acid hydrolysis. The dried saccharides were dissolved in 80 μl H2O, 20 μl of 100% trifluoroacetic acid was added, and the solution was heated for 4 h at 100 °C. The solution was dried again, and the pellet was resuspended in 40% 2-propanol containing 5 mg/ml unlabeled glucose, galactose, sorbitol, and lactose, serving as carriers and internal standards. The sample was analyzed by TLC as described above, but to achieve a better separation of glucose, galactose, and sorbitol, the TLC plate was developed twice in in ethyl acetate/methanol/water/acetic acid (7:2:1:0.1). In this study, we focussed on the first two steps in the type 14 CP biosynthesis. Lipid-linked oligosaccharide intermediates were prepared by glycosyltransferase assays, performed on membrane preparations. Membranes were incubated with 14C-labeled UDP-activated monosaccharides that are part of the serotype 14 polysaccharide subunit: glucose, galactose, orN-acetylglucosamine. Serotype 4, which contains none of these monosaccharides in its polysaccharide structure, was used as a negative control. The incorporation of 14C-label into the glycolipid fraction was measured (Fig. 1 A). Serotype 14 membranes efficiently incorporated [14C]glucose and [14C]galactose but hardly any [14C]N-acetylglucosamine. The incorporation of all labeled sugars into the glycolipid fractions of serotype 4 membranes was much lower than that of serotype 14. Our data agree well with those of Distler and Roseman (24Distler J. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), confirming that the14C-labeled monosaccharides are incorporated into a serotype-specific glycolipid fraction and that either glucose or galactose is the first sugar linked to a lipid carrier. To address this further, the glycolipid fractions were subjected to mild acid hydrolysis and then analyzed by TLC and autoradiography (Fig.1 A). Incubation with only UDP-[14C]glucose resulted in incorporation of mainly glucose (lane 1), whereas UDP-[14C]galactose gave mainly lactose (β-Gal(1→4)β-Glc) and some glucose (lane 2). UDP-glucose will be formed from UDP-galactose by a UDP-glucose-4-epimerase activity, which is apparently present in this system (24Distler J. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Incubation with UDP-[14C]N-acetylglucosamine gave no significant spot (lane 3), whereas unlabeled UDP-glucose, together with UDP-[14C]galactose, results in a prominent lactose spot (lane 4). Strong acid hydrolysis of14C-labeled lactose, released by mild acid hydrolysis of membranes incubated with both UDP-[14C]glucose and UDP-[14C]galactose, gives glucose and galactose, whereas reduction of the 14C-labeled lactose intermediate, followed by strong acid hydrolysis, results in [14C]sorbitol and [14C]galactose (Fig. 1 B). These data show that glucose is the reducing terminal sugar attached to a lipid carrier. In the second biosynthesis step, galactose is linked to this glucose residue, resulting in lipid-linked Galβ(1–4)Glc (lactose). We previously cloned the cps locus of serotype 14 into the low copy number vector pPR691, yielding cosmid clone cMK02 (14Kolkman M.A.B. Morrison D.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Nuijten P.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction fragments of this clone were subcloned in pBluescript, mapped (Fig. 2), and sequenced. Seven complete ORFs were found in this region. No transcription terminator signals were detected within the sequenced region, suggesting that the ORFs are part of one operon. Each ORF is preceded by a ribosome binding site sequence, and they were all closely coupled, being separated by a maximum of 18 nucleotides. The first four ORFs were almost identical tocps19fB-E of S. pneumoniae serotype 19F (13Guidolin G. Morona J.K. Morona R. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5384-5396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore designated cps14B-E. This homology abruptly ends from the start of cps14F. cps14F-H do not show any homology with cps genes of serotype 19F. Gene-specific knock-out mutants of cps14D-H no longer agglutinated with a monoclonal antibody against type 14 CP (see below), confirming that the genes are essential for type 14 CP synthesis. An overview of the properties of the ORFs and their translation products is given in TableI.Table IProperties of the ORFs in the cps locus of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 and homologies with gene products of other bacteriaORFNucleotide position in sequenceG + C%Number of amino acidsPredicted mol weightFunction gene productHomologous gene products (% identity)ReferencekDacps14B1 –72937.324328.6UnknownS. pneumoniae 19F Cps19fB (96.3%)13Guidolin G.

Open table in a new tab The cps14B gene product is homologous to proteins encoded by genes of several other Gram-positive bacteria involved in CP or exopolysaccharide synthesis (Table I), but their function is unknown. The proteins encoded by cps14C and cps14D are homologous to a family of ExoP-like proteins (Table I). They represent two domains that are mostly divided over two proteins, but they are also found combined in one protein (ExoP). The amino acid sequence AISPSSPNIKRNTLIGFLAG (residues 168–187) of Cps14C matches a consensus sequence motif identified for proteins involved in the chain length determination of polysaccharides (30Becker A. Niehaus K. Pühler A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Stingele F. Neeser J-R. Mollet B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hydrophobicity plot of Cps14C resembles those of these proteins, with two hydrophobic segments at its N and C termini, and a hydrophilic domain in the cental part. These data suggest that Cps14C is involved in the chain length determination of type 14 CP. Cps14D contains nucleotide-binding motives as reported for most of the proteins homologous to Cps14D. The sequences GEGKTT (amino acids 46–51) and YIIVD (amino acids 128–132) match the consensus proposed for the Walker nucleotide-binding motifs A and B (34Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence FARAGYKTLLIDGDTR downstream of the Walker A motif matches for 90% another conserved sequence motif found in ATPases (LAXXGXKXLLIDXDXR) reported by Huang and Schell (31Huang J. Schell M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Rhizobium melilotistrains carrying truncated ExoP proteins devoid of the C-terminal domain, including the nucleotide-binding motif, produced smaller amounts of exopolysaccharide with a lower molecular weight, indicating a less efficient transport and an altered chain length regulation (30Becker A. Niehaus K. Pühler A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These data indicate that Cps14D may have a role in chain length determination and export of type 14 CP. Cps14E, a glycosyltransferase, and its homology with other bacterial transferases has been described previously (14Kolkman M.A.B. Morrison D.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Nuijten P.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cps14E contains four potential membrane spanning stretches. Cps14F shows significant homology with the N-terminal part of SpsK of Sphingomonas S88 (35Yamazaki M. Thorne L. Mikolajczak M. Armentrout R.W. Pollock T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2676-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It contains one hydrophobic segment by which it may be anchored into the bacterial membrane. Cps14G is homologous to the C-terminal part of SpsK of SphingomonasS88. These homologies suggest that the gene products ofcps14F and cps14G act together. They may have been one gene originally, or spsK may have evolved from a gene fusion. Based on marginal similarities with putative UDP binding sites of other glycosyltransferases, it was suggested that"
https://openalex.org/W2028735905,"Genes for the Tfb2, Tfb3, and Tfb4 subunits of yeast RNA polymerase transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) are described. All three genes are essential for cell viability, and antibodies against Tfb3 specifically inhibit transcription <i>in vitro</i>. A C-terminal deletion of Tfb2 caused a defect in nucleotide excision repair, as shown by UV sensitivity of the mutant strain and loss of nucleotide excision repair activity in cell extracts (restored by the addition of purified TFIIH). An interaction between Tfb3 and the Kin28 subunit of TFIIH was detected by the two-hybrid approach, consistent with a role for Tfb3 in linking kinase and core domains of the factor. The deduced amino acid sequence of Tfb2 is similar to that of the 52-kDa subunit of human TFIIH, while Tfb3 is identified as a RING finger protein homologous to the 36-kDa subunit of murine CAK (cyclin-dependent kinase activatingkinase) and to the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIIH. Tfb4 is homologous to p34 of human TFIIH and is identified as the weakly associated 37-kDa subunit of the yeast factor. These and other findings reveal a one-to-one correspondence and high degree of sequence similarity between the entire set of yeast and human TFIIH polypeptides."

In the red cell, ankyrin-1 provides the primary linkage between the membrane skeleton and the plasma membrane. To gain additional insight into the structure and function of this protein and to provide the necessary tools for further genetic studies of hereditary spherocytosis patients, we cloned the human ANK-1 chromosomal gene. Characterization of theANK-1 gene genomic structure revealed that the erythroid transcript is composed of 42 exons distributed over ∼160 kilobase pairs of DNA. Comparison of the genomic structure with the protein domains reveals a near-absolute correlation between the tandem repeats encoding the membrane-binding domain of ankyrin with the location of the intron/exon boundaries in the corresponding part of the gene. Erythroid stage-specific, complex patterns of alternative splicing were identified in the region encoding the regulatory domain of ankyrin-1. Novel brain-specific transcripts were also identified in this region, as well as in the “hinge” region between the membrane-binding and spectrin-binding domains.

This important cellular localization of membrane proteins may be provided by the relative affinities of different isoforms of ankyrin for target proteins. This specialization appears to have evolved through the tissue-specific, developmentally regulated expression of multiple protein isoforms. The molecular mechanisms by which ankyrin has acquired distinct isoforms with specialized functions are beginning to be revealed. The isoform diversity of ankyrin arises from different gene products and from differential, alternate splicing of the same gene product (6Lambert S. Yu H. Prchal J.T. Lawler J. Ruff P. Speicher D.

Ankyrins share a common protein structure consisting of an NH2-terminal membrane-binding domain, a spectrin/fodrin-binding domain, and a COOH-terminal regulatory domain (2Bennett V. J. Biol.

Ankyrin binding has been described for a variety of proteins including membrane skeleton proteins, ion transport proteins, and cell adhesion molecules (reviewed in Refs. 1Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8703-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lambert S. Bennett V.

The membrane-binding domain of ankyrin-1 is composed of 24 tandem repeats of approximately 33 amino acids folded into a nearly spherical structure (6Lambert S. Yu H. Prchal J.T. Lawler J. Ruff P.

Homologous ankyrin repeats are found in many proteins with diverse functions and in virtually all cellular compartments (4Peters L.L. Lux S.E. Semin.

Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). They have been found in a variety of organisms including yeast, viruses, bacteria, worms, plants, insects, and vertebrates. Ankyrin repeats interact with an assorted array of proteins suggesting that ankyrin repeats function as a general protein-binding motif. In ankyrin-1, the 24 tandem repeats associate into four independently folded subdomains, each comprised of six ankyrin repeats (23Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22703-22709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different combinations of ankyrin repeat subdomains and varying determinants of the same combination of repeat subdomains lead to diversity in mediating ankyrin-membrane protein binding (24Michaely P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9533-9540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these alternate splices creates the “2.2” isoform of ankyrin-1 due to the deletion of 162 amino acids (6Lambert S. Yu H. Prchal J.T. Lawler J. Ruff P. Speicher D. Cheung M.C. Kan Y.W. Palek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). This 2.2 isoform exhibits greater affinity for spectrin and band 3 binding (26Hall T.G. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10537-10545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These 162 amino acids may act as a repressor by binding back on the rest of the ankyrin-1 molecule leading to allosteric changes (27Davis L.H. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18966-18972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternate splicing of the region encoding the very COOH terminus of ankyrin-1 produces several isoforms with varying carboxyl termini (6Lambert S. Yu H. Prchal J.T. Lawler J. Ruff P. Speicher D.

The functional significance of these different isoforms is unknown. The alternately spliced, extreme COOH-terminal regions are among the few regions of the regulatory domain highly conserved in ankyrin-1 between man and mouse (12White R.A. Birkenmeier C.S. Peters L.L. Barker J.E. Lux S.E. Mamm. Genome. 1992; 3: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the erythrocyte, ankyrin-1 provides the primary linkage between the spectrin-actin based membrane skeleton and the plasma membrane by attaching tetramers of spectrin to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3, the anion exchanger (20Davis L.H.

Ankyrin-1 has been implicated in many cases of hereditary spherocytosis (HS), 1The abbreviations used are: HS, hereditary spherocytosis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); ANK-1, ankyrin-1; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. a common inherited hemolytic anemia characterized by the presence of spherical red cells on peripheral blood smear with increased red cell osmotic fragility. The role of ankyrin in the pathogenesis of HS comes from a variety of sources including biochemical and genetic studies of HS patients (reviewed in Ref. 30Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R.I. Lux S.E.

The primary structure of human ankyrin-1, deduced from sequence of clones obtained from a reticulocyte cDNA library, encodes a mature protein of 1881 amino acids (6Lambert S. Yu H. Prchal J.T.

Northern blot analyses demonstrated ankyrin-1 transcripts of 9 and 7.2 kb in erythroid tissues, with the 9-kb transcript predominating early in erythroid differentiation and the 7.2-kb transcript predominating in reticulocytes (6Lambert S.

Multiple transcripts of varying size are present in muscle (9Chan W. Kordeli E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To gain additional insight into the structure and function of ankyrin-1 and to provide the necessary tools for further genetic studies of HS patients, we cloned the chromosomal gene encoding ankyrin-1 and characterized its genomic structure. We constructed composite human erythroid ANK-1 cDNAs, including previously unpublished 3′-untranslated sequences. In the region encoding the regulatory domain, we identified novel erythroid- and brain-specific transcripts of the human ANK-1 gene created by alternate splicing. The molecular basis of the previously identified erythroid 9- and 7.2-kbANK-1 mRNA transcripts was identified to be mediated by the developmental stage-specific use of alternate polyadenylation signals. Overlapping human ANK-1 cDNA fragments isolated and sequenced by Lux et al. (7Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) that correspond to the entire coding region were used as hybridization probes to screen a human genomic DNA library. The library is a Charon 4A bacteriophage library containing fragments of human genomic DNA partially digested with AluI and HaeIII withEcoRI linkers added (46Lawn R.M. Fritsch E.F. Parker R.C. Blake G. Maniatis T. Cell. 1978; 15: 1157-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). A second genomic DNA library, DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. human foreskin fibroblast P1 library (number 1), was screened with two oligonucleotide primers, A and B (Table I) as described (47Shepherd N.S.

These intronic primers flank exon 2 of the erythroid ANK-1 gene (see below) and amplify an ∼450-bp fragment from genomic DNA. Selected recombinants or DNA fragments that hybridized to the screening probes were purified and subcloned into pGEM-7Z plasmid vectors (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Subcloned fragments were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, Southern blotting, and nucleotide sequencing. Prior to sequencing, some plasmid vectors were manipulated using the ExoIII unilateral direction technique (48Henikoff S.

The sequencing primers were the Sp6 or T7 vectors of the pGEM-7Z plasmid vector or, for some reactions, synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to known cDNA sequences. Deoxyinosine triphosphate was substituted for deoxyguanosine triphosphate to resolve band compressions and ambiguities (50Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Total RNA was prepared from human fetal liver tissue and human bone marrow using the guanidinium-thiocyanate-chloroform method as described (51Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Human reticulocyte RNA was prepared as described using acid precipitation (52Tse W.T. Gallagher P.G. Pothier B. Costa F.F. Scarpa A. Delaunay J. Forget B.G. Blood. 1991; 78: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total human fetal liver RNA (1 mg) was reverse-transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase using an oligo(dT) adapter primer as described (53Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). One-tenth of the reversed-transcribed cDNA was amplified by PCR using an adapter primer and one of two gene-specific primers (E or F, Table I). Amplification products were subcloned and nucleotide sequences determined. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of total fetal liver, bone marrow, or reticulocyte RNA using reverse transcriptase of avian myeloblastosis virus. Primers C or D (Table I) were used for reverse transcription. These cDNAs were used as templates in PCR amplification using an automated DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) as described previously (52Tse W.T. Gallagher P.G. Pothier B. Costa F.F. Scarpa A. Delaunay J. Forget B.G. Blood. 1991; 78: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some reactions, human cDNA libraries were used as templates in the polymerase chain reaction. These included an oligo(dT)-primed human fetal liver cDNA library in λgt11 (54Lundwall A. Dackowski W. Cohen E. Shaffer M. Mahr A. Dahlback B. Stenflo J. Wydro R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oligonucleotide primers used in PCR reactions are listed in Table I. Multiple tissue Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly (A)+ mRNA per tissue were obtained from a commercial source (CLONTECH). Three probes were used in Northern blotting. Probe 1 is pAnk15, an ∼2.3-kb ankyrin cDNA fragment of Lux et al. (7Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Probe 2 is a 1.1-kb ApaI genomic DNA fragment that contains ∼0.75 kb of the very 3′ end of the ANK-1 cDNA. Probe 3 is a 2.0-kb human β-actin cDNA fragment used as a control for loading in Northern blot analyses (55Ng S.Y. Gunning P. Eddy R. Ponte P. Leavitt J. Shows T. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2720-2732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Computer-assisted analyses of derived nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were performed utilizing the sequence analysis software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UW GCG; Madison, WI) (56Genetics Computer Group (1994) Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI.Google Scholar) and the BLAST algorithm, National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) (57Altschul S.F.

Primary screening of the human genomic DNA library in bacteriophage λ with cDNA probes yielded a large number of hybridization-positive plaques. Selected recombinants were analyzed. Twelve overlapping clones were identified that spanned over 190 kb of genomic DNA containing the ANK-1 gene (Fig.1). An EcoRI restriction map of this 190-kb region is shown in Fig. 2. Two additional clones, λ217 and λ261, were isolated that contained ankyrin cDNA fragments but that did not overlap with the other ankyrin clones or each other (Fig. 1). The PCR-based screening of the human genomic DNA P1 library yielded four PCR-positive clones. Of these clones, clone 2032 (DMPC-HFF#1–795 A9) was further analyzed (Fig. 1). This clone contained genomic DNA spanning >80 kb of DNA and covered all the previously nonoverlapping areas. An Xbal restriction map of the 5′ end of this clone that contains intron 1 (42 kb) and intron 2 (24 kb) is shown in Fig. 3.Figure 2EcoRI restriction map.

After stimulation of platelet aggregation with collagen, cortactin undergoes a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation followed by a rapid degradation. The cleavage of platelet cortactin was detected in lysates prepared using either Triton-containing buffer or SDS-sample buffer. However, the degradation of cortactin was not observed in platelets derived from a Glanzmann's patient, who lacked functional integrin αIIbβ3 (GPIIb-IIIa). In addition, the proteolysis of cortactin was abolished by treating platelets before but not after collagen stimulation with EGTA or calpeptin. Furthermore, recombinant cortactin was digested by μ-calpain in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that cortactin is a substrate for calpain. We also observed that the calpain-mediated digestion in vitro is dependent on the presence of a sequence containing a proline-rich region and multiple tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by pp60c- src. Tyrosine phosphorylation by pp60c- src up-regulates the activity of calpain toward cortactin. Our data suggest that the calpain-mediated proteolysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin may provide a mechanism to remodel irreversibly the cytoskeleton in response to platelet agonists.

Overexpression or amplification of the human cortactin gene (also called EMS1) is often associated with human malignancies (7Schuuring E.D. Verhoeven E. Litvinov S. Michalides R.J.A.M. Mol.

In v-Src-transformed cells, cortactin has been found to co-localize with Src oncoproteins within podosomes, membrane-substratum contact structures (6Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Analysis of cortactin phosphorylation in cells lacking the c-src gene (9Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) or following overexpression of c-Csk (10Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578PubMed Google Scholar), a negative regulator for pp60c- src, has provided further compelling evidence that cortactin is an intrinsic substrate for pp60c- src. The protein sequence of cortactin is unique because it contains six and one-half 37-amino acid tandem repeats near the NH2terminus, and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain at the carboxyl-terminal end. Between the repeat and the SH3 domain is an α-helix, a proline-rich region, and multiple tyrosine residues. The amino acid sequence of human cortactin within the repeat domain shares nearly 100% identity with the chicken and murine homologues and 70% with HS1, a cortactin-related gene product (11Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the repeat domain plays a fundamental role for cortactin (12Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Indeed, the repeat domain has been demonstrated as the binding site for F-actin (12Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sequence between the α-helix and the SH3 domain exhibits less than 33% identity to HS1, but the function of this region has not yet been identified. We recently reported that there is abundant expression of cortactin in megakaryocytes and platelets (13Zhan X. Haudenschild C.C. Ni Y. Smith E. Huang C. Blood. 1997; 89: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin has been described as a major phenomenon in thrombin-stimulated platelets (14Wong S. Reynolds A.B. Papkoff J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2407-2415PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the significance of the tyrosine phosphorylation is unknown. In the present study, we examined the fate of cortactin in platelets stimulated by collagen. We found that cortactin is degraded following tyrosine phosphorylation and that the protease responsible for the cortactin degradation is a calpain-related enzyme, which requires integrin αIIbβ3. Furthermore, we provide in vitro evidence that the sequence containing the proline-rich region and multiple tyrosine residues targeted by pp60c- src is required for the calpain-mediated cleavage. Finally, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by pp60c- src dramatically alters its susceptibility to calpain. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may play a role in the calpain-mediated proteolysis of cortactin. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4F11 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (RC20) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal part of murine cortactin was derived from mice immunized with a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 323–546. Prostaglandin E1, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, EGTA, benzamidine, leupeptin, and aprotinin were from Sigma. SDS-PAGE markers were from Bio-Rad. Protein A-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Purified μ-calpain derived from pig erythrocytes was obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Calpeptin was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Sodium orthovanadate was from Fisher. Type I tendon collagen was from Chrono-Log Co. (Havertown, PA). Human blood (500 ml) from healthy volunteers was collected into 70 ml of CPD solution, containing 1.84 mg of sodium citrate, 1.78 mg of dextrose, 209 mg of citric acid, and 155 mg of monobasic sodium phosphate. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 200 × g for 16 min at ambient temperature. Blood from a Glanzmann's patient (female) was kindly provided by Robert Abel (Christina Hospital, Wilmington, DE). Citric acid and prostaglandin E1 were added to platelet-rich plasma to final concentrations of 4 mm and 1 μg/ml, respectively. The platelet-rich plasma was then centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. The platelet pellet was resuspended in washing buffer (4.26 mmNaH2PO4, 7.46 mmNa2HPO4, pH 6.5, containing 5.5 mmdextrose, 128 mm NaCl, 4.77 mm sodium citrate, 2.35 mm citric acid, and 3.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin) and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. The pellet was then resuspended in a modified Tyrode-Hepes buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.35, containing 136.7 mm NaCl, 5 mmglucose, 2.6 mm KCl, 13.8 mmNaHCO3, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.36 mm NaH2PO4, and 3.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 1 × 109 platelets/ml. Collagen at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml was added to the washed platelets (0.6 ml of 1 × 109cells/ml) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 in an aggregometer cuvette at 37 °C for the times indicated. Activated platelets were immediately lysed by adding 200 μl of 4 × Triton lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 4% Triton X-100, 20 mm EGTA, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 mm benzamidine, and 4 mmNa3VO4). The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet (insoluble fraction) was solubilized by adding an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). The soluble fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation by mAb 4F11 (2.5 μg/ml) as described previously (2Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were washed once with 1 × Triton-lysis buffer, resuspended in 2 × SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting analysis with either mAb 4F11 or RC20 as described previously (2Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stirred platelets (0.4 ml of 1 × 109 cells/ml) were stimulated with collagen at 37 °C and lysed by adding an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer including 10 mm EGTA and 20 μm calpeptin. The platelet proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and cortactin was detected by immunoblot analysis. To prepare GST-cortactin, a DNA fragment of 182 bp was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotide ACTCGTGGATCCTGGAAAGCCTCTGCA was used as the 5′ primer and contained a BamHI site; the oligonucleotide CTTGAGCGTCTGGTGTT was used as the 3′ primer and contained an Xmn1 site. The amplified fragment was ligated with a DNA fragment derived from the digestion of a cDNA clone encoding the murine cortactin (2Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with Xmn1 andEcoRI, and the ligated product was then cloned intoBamHI and EcoRI sites of PGEX-2T (Pharmacia). The cortactin variant CortΔ496–546 was prepared as follows. A DNA fragment of 370 base pairs was prepared by polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotide CGAGAGAGCTCAGCGGATGGCC was used as the 5′ primer and contained a SacI site; the oligonucleotide ACTGCAGAATTCTAGATGGCTGTGATGCC was used as the 3′ primer and contained an EcoRI site and a stop codon. The amplified fragment was cloned into a DNA fragment derived from the digestion of GST-cortactin with SacI and EcoRI. CortΔ375–546was prepared in the same way as CortΔ496–546 except that the oligonucleotide CGAGAGAGCTCAGTAACGGATCGCCAAAGAA was used as the 5′ primer and contained a stop codon and a SacI site. All polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cortactin and its variants were expressed inEscherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (17Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were further digested with thrombin, and the glutathioneS-transferase-free proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose (1Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant cortactin (3.6 μg) was incubated with μ-calpain for 90 min at different concentrations in 40 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.36, containing 134 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 75 μm EGTA, and 75 μm CaCl2). The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by a gradient SDS-PAGE gel (4–20%, w/v). The digested proteins were visualized by either Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting with mAb 4F11 or a polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide encoding the amino acid sequence from the α-helix to the SH3 domain. To evaluate the role of cortactin in platelet aggregation, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in collagen-stimulated platelets. Activated platelets were lysed using a Triton X-100-containing buffer. The soluble fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 4F11, a mAb recognizing the repeat domain of cortactin (6Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The pellets were solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Proteins in both fractions were immunoblotted using either a polyclonal antibody against cortactin or a mAb against phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig.1 A, stimulation of stirred platelets with collagen caused a dramatic increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin after 15 s and a maximum phosphorylation at 45 s, which was concomitant with platelet aggregation (data not shown). However, the level of phosphorylated cortactin declined slightly after 1 min of stimulation, and this coincided with a decrease in the level of cortactin in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1 B). We examined the possibility that a reduced amount of cortactin in the soluble fraction in response to collagen could be a consequence of the cytoskeletal translocation that has been described previously in thrombin-stimulated platelets (15Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ozawa K. Kashiwada K. Takahashi M. Sobue K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of cortactin in the insoluble fraction demonstrated that the stimulation of platelets with collagen enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including those that migrated at the positions for cortactin (Fig. 1 C). However, the amount of cortactin associated with the insoluble fraction was only transiently increased during the period from 30 to 45 s and diminished afterward (Fig.1 D), suggesting that platelet cortactin, in either the soluble or insoluble fractions, was degraded after collagen stimulation. The degradation of cortactin appears not caused by a nonspecific proteolysis because pp60c- src associated with the pellets was not degraded under the same conditions even after a prolonged stimulation (Fig. 1 D). To confirm that the apparent degradation of cortactin was not the result of a protease released during the Triton-mediated lysis, we analyzed cortactin in platelet lysates that were prepared by direct lysis in SDS-sample buffer. The results from these experiments were compared with the pattern of cortactin degradation prepared in Triton X-100 buffer. As shown in Fig. 2 A, significant amount of degraded cortactin was detected in the SDS-lysed whole platelets after collagen stimulation, although the extent of the degradation, especially at early phases of stimulation (30 and 45 s), appeared to be less than that of Triton-lysed platelets. However, the degradation patterns in both lysates are similar (Fig.2 B). Calpain is a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases that are abundantly present in platelets and are activated during platelet aggregation (19Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar,20Fox J.E. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, EGTA treatment of platelets significantly inhibited the degradation of cortactin as compared with untreated platelets. Furthermore, treatment with calpeptin, a specific membrane-permeable peptide-derivative inhibitor for calpain (21Tsujinaka T. Kajiwara Y. Kambayashi J. Sakon M. Higuchi N. Tanaka T. Mori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), resulted in the same reduction of cortactin degradation (Fig. 3 B, part a). However, when a lysis buffer containing either EGTA or calpeptin was used to lyse activated platelets, no significant inhibition of cortactin degradation was observed (Fig. 3 B, parts b and c). This result further confirms that the degradation of cortactin primarily occurs prior to platelet lysis. In platelets, the influx of calcium can be regulated by the activation of αIIbβ3 (22Fujimoto T. Fujimura K. Kuramoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16370-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rybak M.E. Renzulli L.A. Bruns M.J. Cahaly D.P. Blood. 1988; 72: 714-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a major integrin on the surface of platelets. To evaluate the role of αIIbβ3 in the proteolysis of cortactin, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in platelets from a Glanzmann's patient. As shown in Fig. 4, normal platelets exhibited a 60% reduction in the amount of intact cortactin after 3 min of collagen stimulation. In contrast, no significant reduction was found with the Glanzmann's platelets, suggesting that the degradation of cortactin requires αIIbβ3 under identical conditions. Interestingly, the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in response to collagen in the Glanzmann's platelets was not impaired (Fig. 4), implying that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is a process independent of αIIbβ3. Purified μ-calpain (calpain-I) digests recombinant murine cortactin in vitro in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A). At a concentration of 6.2 μg/ml of calpain, approximately 90% of the cortactin proteins were digested to multiple fragments. Interestingly, many of the digested fragments were reactive to mAb 4F11, which specifically recognizes the repeat domain of cortactin (12Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), but not to an antibody directed against the region between the repeat and the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 6 A). This implies that the sequence in this region may be more susceptible to calpain. To verify this, we analyzed two cortactin variants, CortΔ496–546, which lacks the SH3 domain, and CortΔ375–546, which lacks the sequence from the proline-rich region to the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 6 B,upper part). As with the wild-type cortactin, the mutant CortΔ496–546 was efficiently digested by calpain (Fig.6 B, lower part). In contrast, little digestion of the mutant CortΔ375–546 was detected under the same conditions, indicating that the sequence of amino acids 375–496, which contains the proline-rich region and multiple tyrosine residues, may be involved in the calpain-mediated proteolysis.Figure 6Calpain-mediated digestion requires the presence of a sequence containing the proline-rich region and multiple tyrosine residues. A, cortactin was incubated for 90 min in either the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of 1.5 μg/ml μ-calpain. The digested proteins were immunoblotted with mAb 4F11 (a) or a polyclonal antibody against amino acids 323–546 (b). B, upper part, schematic presentation of cortactin and cortactin mutants. The areas for the repeat (Repeat), the α-helix (Helix), the proline-rich region (P), and tyrosine residues targeted by pp60c- src (Y) are indicated;lower part, cortactin and its mutants were digested with μ-calpain, and the resultant fragments were analyzed by immunoblotting with mAb 4F11.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Amino acids 375–496 contain multiple tyrosine residues that can be targeted for phosphorylation by pp60c- src. 2J. Qiu and X. Zhan, manuscript in preparation. Thus, we performed a calpain digestion of cortactin phosphorylated by pp60c- src. Fig. 7 shows that most phosphorylated cortactin proteins were digested nearly completely within 2 min. In contrast, significant amounts of nonphosphorylated cortactin remained even after 20 min of digestion under the same conditions. However, when partially digested phosphorylated cortactin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and compared with nonphosphorylated cortactin, we did not observe any significant difference in the two patterns (Fig.7). Therefore, it is likely that tyrosine phosphorylation enhances the efficiency of calpain-mediated digestion without altering its cleavage sites. It is unclear whether platelet calpain-mediated proteolysis occurs during lysis of cells or within aggregated platelets (24Wencel-Drake J.D. Okita J.R. Annis D.S. Kunicki T.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 882-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Elce J.S. Sigmund L. Fox M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the proteolysis of cortactin occurs within activated platelets. We detected the degradation of cortactin in whole platelets prepared by direct lysis in a SDS-sample buffer (Figs. 2 and 4). In addition, the calpain inhibitors EGTA and calpeptin block the degradation when they are applied before but not after platelet activation. Finally, it appears that the calpain-mediated proteolysis of cortactin is not the result of a nonspecific proteolysis, because pp60c- src, another substrate for calpain (26Oda A. Druker B.J. Ariyoshi H. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12603-12608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not degraded under the same conditions that allow cortactin proteolysis (Fig. 1 D). However, it should be pointed out that the degree of the proteolysis of cortactin in activated platelets appears to vary depending on the method of lysing platelets. There is more extensive degradation found in Triton-lysed platelets than in SDS sample buffer (Fig. 2). This may be due to the fact that the soluble cortactin becomes more vulnerable to calpain released after lysis. In agreement with other reports (15Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ozawa K. Kashiwada K. Takahashi M. Sobue K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we observed that cortactin undergoes a transient translocation into the Triton-insoluble fraction between 30 and 45 s after collagen stimulation (Fig.1 D); however, the role of the translocation in this proteolysis of cortactin is not clear. While cortactin is a potent F-actin binding and cross-linking protein, the presence of F-actin does not apparently change the efficiency of the proteolysis of cortactinin vitro (data not shown). Furthermore, a cortactin mutant able to bind to F-actin but lacking the sequence from the proline-rich region to the carboxyl terminus is not efficiently digested by calpain (Fig. 6 B). Hence, it is unlikely that the F-actin binding is a rate-limiting step for the calpain digestion. Many cytoskeleton-associated proteins have been reported to be substrates for calpain.

Chem. 1986; 261: 4101-4105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with many of those substrates, proteolysis of cortactin appears to be dependent on αIIbβ3because it does not occur in Glanzmann's platelets lacking functional αIIbβ3 (Fig. 4). We have found, however, that the absence of αIIbβ3 does not affect collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. Our finding is in agreement with a previous report, which also showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation in thrombin-treated platelets derived from Glanzmann's patients (15Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin can be detected after 15 s of stimulation (Fig.1 A). This is prior to platelet aggregation, which occurs 30–45 s after stimulation. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is kinetically correlated with the activation of pp60c- src, which occurs in the early phase prior to the activation of αIIbβ3 during platelet stimulation (33Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin could be involved in the calpain-mediated digestion. The importance of Src in the digestion of cortactin is further highlighted by our findings that the digestion of recombinant cortactin by μ-calpain is dependent on the presence of a sequence containing multiple tyrosine residues targeted by pp60c- src (Fig. 6), and the efficiency of the digestion of cortactin in vitro is dramatically increased by pp60c- src (Fig. 7). Calpain-digested cortactin in vitro has significantly less F-actin cross-linking activity (data not shown). Interestingly, the F-actin cross-linking activity can be also down-regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation without degradation (1Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These dual mechanisms regulating cortactin may be required to ensure the irreversible shape change associated with activated platelets. It is also noteworthy that both mechanisms involve the same structural region between the proline-rich motif and the SH3 domain. This may suggest the importance of this region in the regulation of cortactin function. Since calpain and cortactin are widely expressed in many mammalian cells, future studies using a structure-function approach should reveal the significance of calpain-mediated cleavage of cortactin in cellular cytoskeletal reorganization.

Previous results indicated that the cAMP response element (CRE) residing at −45 to −38 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site is essential for both basal and cAMP-inducible promoter activity of the 2.4-kilobase or shorter upstream sequence of the TH gene (Kim, K. S., Lee, M. K., Carroll, J., and Joh, T. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 15689–15695; Lazaroff, M., Patankar, S., Yoon, S. O., and Chikaraishi, D. M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 21579–21589). Here, we further report that the CRE is critical for the promoter activity of the 5.6- or 9.0-kilobase upstream sequences of the rat TH gene, which had been shown to direct the cell-specific TH expression in vivo. To define the structure/function relationship of the CRE in transcriptional activation of the TH gene, we performed saturated mutational analyses of 12 nucleotides encompassing the CRE. Mutation of any nucleotide within the octamer motif results in a significant decrease of both basal and cAMP-inducible transcriptional activity of the TH reporter gene construct. Among the four nucleotides adjacent to the CRE (two 5′ and two 3′), only the G residue at the immediate 3′ position is important for full transcriptional activity. DNase I footprint analysis indicates a positive correlation between in vivo promoter activity and in vitro interaction between the CRE motif and its cognate protein factor(s). Reconstruction experiments using a TH promoter in which the native CRE was rendered inactive show that the CRE can transactivate transcription in either orientation through a window of approximately 200 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site, suggesting that CRE supports transcriptional activation of the TH gene in a distance-dependent manner. Finally, when the distance between the CRE and TATA box was changed by inserting an additional 5 or 10 bases, it was observed that both insertional mutations increased activity by approximately 3-fold. The cAMP inducibility was as intact as the wild type construct. Together, these results are consistent with a model in which transcriptional activation of the TH gene by the CRE requires that it be located within a certain proximity of the CAP site but does not depend on a stringent stereospecific alignment in relationship to the TATA element.

Neuronal plasticity, essential for the adaptive function of the nervous system, depends on the capacity of cells to alter expression of target genes in response to environmental stimuli. Many stimuli alter cellular activity via receptors coupled to adenylate cylase. The resultant increases of the intracellular cAMP levels stimulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of the target molecules such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), 1The abbreviations used are: CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; CRE, cAMP response element; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). which is an essential step in transcriptional activation by this protein factor (3Gonzalez G.A.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In numerous cAMP-inducible eukaryotic genes, an octamer DNA motif with the nucleotide sequence 5′-TGACGTCA-3′, termed cAMP response element (CRE), mediates transcriptional induction by the cAMP-regulated signaling pathway (5Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Goodman R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recent evidence strongly suggests that the cAMP-regulated signaling pathway plays essential roles in adaptive functions of the nervous system in that CREB-dependent gene transcription is critically involved in learning and memory (reviewed in Ref. 7Frank D.A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1995; 79: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (343) Google Scholar) as well as in behavioral manifestations of opiate dependence (8Maldonado R. Blendy J.A. Tzavara E. Gass P. Roques B.P. Hanoune J. Schütz G. Science. 1996; 273: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2; tyrosine 3-monooxygenase; TH) is an important brain enzyme because it catalyzes the conversion ofl-tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine, which is the first and rate-limiting step of catecholamine biosynthesis (9Nagatsu T. Levitt M. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2910-2917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TH is selectively expressed in catecholamine-synthesizing and secreting cells, including dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system and sympathetic ganglia and adrenal chromaffin cells in the periphery. The 5′-flanking sequence of the rat TH gene contains a consensus CRE motif located at −38 to −45 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site (10Lewis E.J. Harrington C.A. Chikaraishi D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Earlier studies of the TH promoter activity by Chikaraishi and colleagues (11Cambi F. Fung B. Chikaraishi D. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Fung B.P. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2044-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) using the PC8b cell line as the positive system showed that the AP1 motif and an overlapping E box/dyad, located at −205 and −182 bp, is the most important basal and cell-specific promoter element. In these studies, the CRE was suggested to be unimportant for TH transcription. However, more recent evidence from several laboratories using other TH-positive cell lines supports the idea that the cAMP-regulated signaling pathway, via the CRE, importantly regulates transcription of the TH gene. First, transient expression assays in TH-expressing cell lines such as the human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C and rat PC12 (1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or mouse CATH.a and PATH.a (2Lazaroff M. Patankar S. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21579-21589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) show that the CRE is critical for both basal and cAMP-inducible transcription of the rat TH gene. Secondly, TH gene expression is significantly attenuated at the transcriptional level in several cAMP-dependent protein kinase-deficient PC12 cell lines (14Kim K.S. Park D.H. Wessel T.C. Song B. Wagner J.A. Joh T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3471-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Finally, coexpression of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase dramatically increases the transcriptional activity of the rat TH gene in a dose-dependent manner, whereas coexpression of the specific cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor blocks cAMP-stimulated induction and reduces basal transcriptional activity (15Kim K.S. Tinti C. Song B. Cubells J.F. Joh T.H. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To understand TH gene regulation by the CRE in greater detail, we investigated the structure/function relationship of the CRE in transcriptional activation. To define individual nucleotides that are important for transcriptional activational function, we performed saturated mutagenesis of the 12-bp region of the rat TH gene that encompasses the CRE and examined the effect of individual mutation on basal and cAMP-inducible transcription by transient transfection assay using TH-expressing SK-N-BE(2)C cell line. In vivo promoter activity was correlated with in vitro interaction between the CRE and transcription factors by comparing the DNase I footprint patterns of the wild type and CRE-mutated upstream sequences using nuclear extracts of the SK-N-BE(2)C as well as purified CREB protein. We also determined whether the position of the CRE relative to the TATA box can affect its transcriptional activation function. Surprisingly, this study indicates that transcriptional activation by the CRE is distance-dependent but does not require a stringent stereospecific alignment in relation to the TATA element. Human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C cells (16Ciccarone V. Spengler B.A. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Lab.), 100 units/ml of penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). CATH.a cells (17Suri C. Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Hyclone Lab), 5% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. TH2400CAT fusion construct contained 2.4-kb upstream sequences of the rat TH gene fused to the bacterial CAT gene as described (1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Longer reporter gene constructs, TH9000CAT and TH5600CAT, containing 9.0- and 5.6-kb upstream sequences, respectively, were also generated. TH9000CAT was constructed by replacing the 1.6-kb HindIII-XhoI DNA fragment of TH2400CAT by an 8.3-kb HindIII-XhoI DNA fragment of pTH9.0 (18Min N. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. Peng C. Son J.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A 3.4-kb SphI DNA fragment was then deleted from TH9000CAT, resulting in TH5600CAT. To make CRE mutant forms of these longer constructs, TH2400(41C40G)CAT, which contains a double mutation within the CRE (15Kim K.S. Tinti C. Song B. Cubells J.F. Joh T.H. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was used in place of TH2400CAT in the above procedure. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed based on the procedure of Nakamaye and Ekstein (19Nakamaye K. Ekstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9679-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) as described previously (1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate saturated mutations in the TH CRE, the present procedure employed a degenerate 24-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-GGCCAGG*C*T*G*A*C*G*T*C*A*A*A*GCCCCT-3′, in which the asterisks denote degenerate bases with 5% substitution of each of the other three nucleotides (Bio-Synthesis, Inc., Denton, TX). Among 136 individual clones isolated and sequenced, 56 were found to be mutants. Of these mutant clones, 19 single substitution mutants and 11 double mutants were further analyzed in this study. Other mutants were constructed to examine the position dependence of the CRE in transcriptional activation function. Oligonucleotides with sequences 5′-GAGGGGCTTTGACGTCAGCCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCTGACGTCAAAGCCCCTC-3′, representing both strands of the CRE region at −54 to −32 bp of the rat TH gene, were annealed and inserted at BglII (−168 bp),BamHI (−503 bp), XhoI (−773 bp),PstI (−2400 bp), or SmaI (+1700 bp) sites of the 42A38G mutant construct that contain a double substitution mutation (see Fig. 2). The copy number and orientation of the inserted DNA were confirmed by sequence analysis. In addition, oligonucleotides of the sequences 5′-CGCCCTCTTTAAATGACGTCAAAGCC-3′, 5′-TCTTTAAAGGCCACGTGAGGCTGACGTCA-3′, and 5′-TCTTTAAAGGCCACGTGACTGCAGGCTGACGTCA-3′ were used to generate 2400TH(−8)CAT, 2400TH(+5)CAT, and 2400TH(+10)CAT, respectively. The modified sequences of the upstream region of these mutant reporter genes were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (20Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) as described (21Seo H. Yang C.Y. Kim H.-S. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4102-4112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For SK-N-BE(2)C cells, 50% confluent 60-mm dishes were transfected with 2 μg of the reporter construct, 1 μg of pRSV-βgal, and pUC19 plasmid to a total of 5 μg of DNA. For CATH.a cells, doubled amounts of plasmids were used. For the experiments described in Fig. 1, an equimolar amount of each reporter construct was used for transfection. Transfected cells were collected 36 h after transfection, and activities of CAT and β-galactosidase were determined as described elsewhere (20Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar, 22An G. Hidaka K. Siminovitch L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that all CAT assays were performed in the linear range, the final sample volume was adjusted following preliminary assays so that chloramphenicol conversion amounted to 5–50%. The CAT activity was normalized by the β-galactosidase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiency among different DNA precipitates. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from SK-N-BE(2)C cells based on described procedures (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar). To obtain a CRE area probe labeled on the noncoding strand, p2400THCAT and the 42A38G mutant construct were cut with Bsu36I and end-labeled with Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]TTP according to procedures suggested by vendors. The probe was then digested with NcoI and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (24Kim K.S. Park D.H. Wessel T. Febrario M. Joh T.H. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. A Practical Approach: Gene Probe II. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 151-182Google Scholar). Labeled probes (30,000 cpm) were incubated with nuclear extracts or purified CREB protein, treated with DNase I, and resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide/8 m urea-sequencing gel as described (21Seo H. Yang C.Y. Kim H.-S. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4102-4112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Location of the protected area was determined by Maxam-Gilbert sequencing of labeled probes. As shown in Fig. 1 A, double mutation within the CRE diminished the promoter activity of the 2.4-kb sequence of the rat TH gene as well as activities of longer 5.6- and 9.0-kb upstream sequences in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C cell line. These longer upstream sequences were shown to confer cell type-specific expression of reporter genes in transgenic mice (18Min N. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. Peng C. Son J.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Banerjee S.A. Hoppe P. Brilliant M. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4460-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CRE is likewise essential for the promoter activities of these upstream sequences in another TH-expressing cell line, CATH.a (17Suri C. Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had been derived from the central nervous system (Fig. 1 B). In addition, these CRE mutant constructs do not respond to forskolin treatment (data not shown), indicating that the CRE is required for both basal and cAMP-inducible transcriptional activities of the 5′ TH upstream sequences. Using site-directed mutagenesis procedure with a degenerate oligonucleotide we isolated 19 different point mutations that include at least one mutation in every position of twelve bases encompassing the CRE motif and its four proximal bases (two 5′ and two 3′ to the CRE octamer) (Fig. 2). The effects of these mutations on basal transcription and cAMP inducibility were examined in the context of the 2400 bp upstream sequence of the rat TH gene by the transient transfection assay using the TH-expressing SK-N-BE(2)C cells. First, mutation of any nucleotide within the CRE resulted in a significant loss of basal transcription activity, demonstrating that the octamer CRE motif of the TH gene is the functionally optimal sequence motif. Intriguingly, mutations to different nucleotides at a particular position appear to have differential effects; for instance, replacement of C residue by T at −39 bp (39T in Fig. 2 C) diminished more than 90% of the basal transcription but an A substitution (39A in Fig. 2 C) retained approximately half of the promoter activity. Substitution mutations of surrounding bases at −36, −46, and −47 bp show little or no effect on the promoter activity, indicating that these nucleotide sequences do not affect the CRE function. However, the G residue at −37 bp, immediately 3′ to the CRE, appears to be important because its change to an A or a T residue results in a decrease of basal transcription activity by 60–70%. The 11 double mutations all exhibited a significant decrease of promoter activity (Fig. 2). Residual activities of double mutants (at least 10% of that of the wild type promoter) may arise from promoter activities of other elements, e.g. AP1 (1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cambi F. Fung B. Chikaraishi D. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, mutations that exhibit a significant decrease in basal transcription also exhibited a significant defect in the cAMP inducibility. Conversely, mutant constructs with basal transcription activity >30% of the wild type without exception showed cAMP inducibility equivalent to that of the wild type construct. Mutations of the CRE likely affect binding affinities of the cognate transcription factors and thereby account for the decreased transcriptional activities. DNase I footprint analysis demonstrates that the nucleotides starting from −32 to −50 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, which encompasses the CRE, are protected by nuclear proteins when the wild type sequence is used as the probe (Fig. 3 A). It is to be noted that the TATA region was not detectably protected in this footprinting assay, indicating that the DNA-protein interaction at the TATA of the TH gene is weak. This weak binding affinity of the TATA, at least in part, may underlie the essential function of the CRE in TH transcription. The corresponding CRE area of the mutant 42A38G was not protected at all by the same nuclear proteins (Fig. 3 B). This mutant construct contains base substitutions at −42 and −38 nucleotides, C to A and A to G, respectively, and exhibited minimal promoter activity (Fig. 2). Furthermore, purified CREB footprinted the wild type CRE area at the identical region but not that of 42A38G mutant sequence (Fig.3 C), supporting the suggestion that CREB is a transcription factor acting at the TH CRE. To address whether the CRE activates TH transcription in a position- and distance-dependent manner, reconstruction experiments were performed using the 42A38G mutant construct (Fig.4 A; see also Figs. 2 and 3). In this experimental paradigm, we tested the effects of the location, copy number, and orientation of the CRE motif on its ability to support the basal transcription as well as the cAMP inducibility. As shown in Fig.4 B, when located at −168 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, the CRE supported both basal transcription and cAMP-mediated induction of the reporter gene as efficiently as the wild type construct. At the same locus, two copies of the CRE in opposite orientation drive basal CAT expression at approximately twice the level of the wild type construct. However, the level of cAMP inducibility was the same as that of the native promoter. Additional copies appear to exert no further increases in basal and cAMP-inducible transcription of the reporter gene. Strikingly, the CRE did not support basal transcription at further upstream regions, e.g. at −503, −773, and −2400 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. In addition, the CRE at these loci no longer mediated transcriptional induction following treatment with forskolin. To determine whether multiple copies of the CRE could overcome the incompetence of transcription activation at these loci, we inserted two and three copies of the CRE at −503 bp, two copies at −773 bp, and two and four copies at −2400 bp. These constructs did not significantly support basal transcription of the reporter gene. In contrast, cAMP inducibility was restored to the level of the native promoter when three and four copies of the CRE were inserted at −503 and −2400 bp, respectively. When located 3′ to the reporter gene at +1600 bp, a single copy of the CRE supported neither basal transcription nor cAMP inducibility of the reporter construct. The CRE of the TH gene resides 8 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box, showing the closest proximity to the TATA box among known cAMP-regulated genes. This unique spatial arrangement suggests that the stereospecific alignment between the CRE and the TATA may be important for transcription activation. To test this, we examined whether alterations of the distance between the CRE and TATA affect transcriptional activity (Fig. 5). Five nucleotides were inserted between the CRE and TATA, adding a half helical turn in the reporter construct TH2400(+5)CAT. Surprisingly, this mutant construct drove CAT expression 2.8-fold more strongly than did the wild type reporter construct. Insertion of 10 nucleotides between the CRE and the TATA, which would produce approximately a full helical turn between them, similarly increased basal CAT expression by 3-fold. The CAT expression by these two spatial mutant constructs was induced to a level comparable with that by the wild type construct following treatment with forskolin. Taken together, the CRE of the TH gene does not require stereospecific arrangement in relationship to the TATA box for its transcriptional activation activity. Furthermore, our results suggest that the native location of the CRE may contribute to determining the level of basal expression of the TH gene.

To understand TH gene regulation by the cAMP-regulated signaling pathway in greater detail, this study defined the relationship between the structure and function of the CRE in transcriptional activation of the TH-CAT reporter gene. Mutation of the CRE in the context of 9.0-, 5.6-, and 2.4-kb upstream sequences of the rat TH gene largely diminished their transcriptional activities in TH-expressing SK-N-BE(2)C and CATH.a cell lines (Fig. 1). Previous transgenic mice experiments demonstrated that longer upstream sequences of the rat TH gene, e.g. 4.8 or 9.0 kb, can direct expression of the reporter genes in a tissue-specific manner (18Min N. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. Peng C. Son J.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Banerjee S.A. Hoppe P. Brilliant M. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4460-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our data showing that the CRE is critical for the promoter activities of the 5.6- and 9.0-kb upstream sequences in both TH positive cell lines, we conclude that the CRE may be important forin vivo TH gene transcription. The present analysis (Fig. 2) showed that (i) base substitution of any nucleotide within the octamer motif results in a significant decrease of the promoter activity (55–90%), demonstrating that every base of the octamer motif is important for intact transcription activation function of the CRE; (ii) among the nucleotides adjacent to the TH CRE, only the G residue residing immediately 3′ to the CRE is important for full transcriptional activity; (iii) mutation of a specific nucleotide may have differential effects depending on the substituted nucleotide; and (iv) a mutation that shows a significant reduction in basal transcription no longer mediates an intact cAMP induction. Although the upstream area at −32 to −50 bp of the wild type sequence was footprinted by both nuclear proteins of SK-N-BE(2)C cells and bacterially expressed CREB, that of the mutant 42A38G construct with minimal promoter activity was not protected at all, indicating a positive correlation between in vivo promoter activity andin vitro DNA-protein interaction (Fig. 3). In addition, this observation is consistent with the idea that CREB is the transcription factor or one of the factors that bind to and transactivate the CRE. In support of this, coincubation of nuclear extracts with anti-CREB antibody results in formation of a supershifted band in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (35Tinti C. Conti B. Cubells J.F. Kim K.-S. Baker H. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25375-25381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 2C. Yang and K.-S. Kim, unpublished data. However, in view of the increasing number of identified CRE-binding proteins (reviewed in Refs. 36Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 37Meyer T. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that additional protein factors may be involved in binding to the CRE and regulating TH transcription. Antibody coincubation experiments indeed suggested that additional protein factors including ATF1 and CREM may bind to the TH CRE.2 Further, forskolin treatment of PC12 cells and reserpine treatment of rats induced expression of the inducible cAMP early repressor, an isoform of the CREM family (38Stehle J.H. Foulkes N.S. Molina C.A. Simonneaux V. Pevet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 365: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), which represses the transcriptional activity of the TH gene promoter (35Tinti C. Conti B. Cubells J.F. Kim K.-S. Baker H. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25375-25381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To address whether the CRE activates transcription in a distance-dependent manner, an oligonucleotide encompassing the TH CRE was inserted at different loci 5′ or 3′ to the reporter gene in the mutant 42A38G construct (Fig. 4). Strikingly, this reconstruction experiment demonstrates that the CRE can support basal and cAMP-inducible transcription in either orientation only through a window of approximately 200 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. When three or four copies of the CRE are inserted at −503 and −2400 bp, respectively, they restore the forskolin inducibility but still do not support basal transcription of the reporter gene. The CRE is generally known to have properties of an enhancer (39Comb M. Hyman S.E. Goodman H.M. Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 473-478Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This notion is based on earlier studies indicating that the CRE of the proenkephalin gene can activate transcription when located in positions relatively distant from the transcription initiation site or at 3′ to the gene (40Comb M. Birnberg N.C. Seasholtz A. Herbert E. Goodman H.M. Nature. 1986; 323: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Our results thus contrast to the general notion that the CRE can work in a distance- and position-independent manner. The structure and function of the CRE of the proenkephalin gene differ from those of the TH gene in that it is heptanucleotide with the sequence 5′-TGCGTCA-3′ and mediates both cAMP and phorbol ester inducibility. Thus, the mechanisms underlying the function of the octamer CRE and the heptamer CRE may be significantly different. It is to be noted that most known CREs are located within the proximal 170 bp of upstream region and have the octamer structure (Ref. 1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). One obvious exception is the tyrosine aminotransferase gene, which has a functional CRE at the −3650-bp position (41Boshart M. Weih F. Schmidt A. Keith Founier R.E. Schütz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 905-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Here, the CRE has the same haptamer motif as that of the proenkephalin gene and is one of the functionally interdependent components of a hepatocyte-specific enhancer (41Boshart M. Weih F. Schmidt A. Keith Founier R.E. Schütz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 905-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this context, one interesting possibility is that the CRE activates TH transcription synergistically with other cis-element(s), and this synergism works in a distance- and/or promoter context-dependent manner. In support of this, we recently found that mutation of a contiguous cis-regulatory element, Sp1, at −120 to −113 bp (11Cambi F. Fung B. Chikaraishi D. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) diminished the basal promoter activity by 85%, suggesting a synergistic activation of TH transcription by the CRE and Sp1.2 This potential mechanism underlying the distance-dependent activation of TH transcription is currently being investigated. Finally, we determined whether the location of the CRE relative to the TATA box is important for transcriptional activity (Fig. 5). For many genes that are inducible by hormone, the optimal inducibility and synergism often require stereospecific alignments (42Schule R. Muller M. Kaltsschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Science. 1988; 242: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 43Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 443-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stereospecific alignment of several promoter elements of eukaryotic genes relative to basic elements, e.g. TATA box, are known to be critical for full promoter activity (44Takahashi K. Vigneron M. Matthes H. Wildeman A. Zenke M. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 319: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 45Xie W. Rothblum L.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1266-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 46Li H. Capetanaki Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3580-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The CRE and the TATA elements are essential for TH gene transcription (1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lazaroff M. Patankar S. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and are separated from each other by 8 nucleotides. Insertion of either 5 or 10 nucleotides between these elements resulted in an increase of the basal promoter activity by approximately 3-fold, indicating that phasic interactions between the cognate binding proteins are not required for supporting basal transcription. This observation is thus consistent with a model that the CRE-binding protein(s) may activate TH transcription through a co-factor. CREB-binding protein, a recently identified transcriptional coactivator of CREB (47Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar), is one such candidate molecule. CREB-binding protein, recruited to cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylated CREB by protein-protein interaction (48Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar), may activate transcription of the TH gene, thus obviating the requirement for stereospecific alignment between the CRE and the TATA elements. In summary, we defined the structure/function relationship of the CRE in TH transcription by performing the saturated mutagenesis, reconstruction experiments, and insertional mutation analyses and by examining their effects on the promoter activity in the context of the 2.4-kb upstream sequence. Our results for the first time show that every nucleotide of the octamer of the CRE as well as the G base immediately 3′ are important for full basal and cAMP-inducible transcriptional activity of the TH promoter. In addition, the CRE needs to be located within a certain proximity in the upstream region for exhibiting full transcriptional activation function, indicating that the CRE supports transcriptional activation of the TH gene in a distance-dependent manner. Furthermore, insertional mutation analyses suggest that the native spatial arrangement of the CRE and TATA elements may contribute to determining the level of basal TH gene expression in vivo. In support of these notions, the nucleotide sequences and the location of the CRE in relation to the TATA box are well conserved in all the TH genes identified from different species (Fig. 6). Specifically, 12 nucleotides encompassing the CRE are strictly conserved in the TH upstream sequences of all six species thus far identified. We thank Dr. M. Montminy (The Salk Institute) for providing the bacterially expressed CREB. We also thank Dr. T. S. Nowak, Jr., in the Department of Neurology for critically reading this manuscript."

These single cell clones provided an opportunity to identify SREBP1-regulated genes that may influence the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins.

Previous studies showed a coordinate induction of the synthesis of all VLDL lipids and the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins in response to changes in metabolic state (e.g.during dietary carbohydrate overload (10Boogaerts J.R. Malone M.M. Archambault S.J. Davis R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E77-E83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fetal development (11Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. Sand T.M. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 33-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In contrast, fasting caused a coordinate repression of all of these processes (12Davis R.A. Boogaerts J.R. Borchardt R.A.

These findings led us to propose that in a coordinate manner, metabolic signals control multiple steps of the VLDL assembly/secretion pathway. Using a somatic cell genetic approach, we examined this possibility. Previous experiments showed that expression of the liver-specific gene 7α-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.17) in non-hepatic Chinese hamster ovary cells increased the transcription of the LDL receptor gene (14Dueland S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22695-22698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a process now known to be regulated by the SREBP family of transcription factors (15Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sterol-responsive transcriptional regulation is invoked by a proteolytic cleavage of the initial translational SREBP gene product that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as a trans-membrane loop (17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 18Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). When the sterol content of cells is insufficient to meet metabolic demands, proteolysis of the N-terminal domain releases the DNA binding domain of SREBP(s) (mature forms), allowing them to enter the nucleus and activate transcription of genes having cognitive promoter elements. Expression of 7α-hydroxylase in cells that do not normally express it increases the cellular content of mature SREBP1 (see “Results”). Moreover, since McArdle rat hepatoma cells express all of the genes required to assemble and secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins (19Tanabe S. Sherman H. Smith L. Yang L.A. Fleming R. Hay R.

These cells provide a unique opportunity to examine how SREBP1 may affect each of the steps of the VLDL assembly/secretion pathway. The results indicate that SREBP1 coordinately regulates many of the individual lipogenic and protein processing steps.

Poly+A RNA was isolated from cells using a modification of the guanidinium isothiocyanate method, as described (27Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two to 5 μg of the resulting mRNA was separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with nick-translated 32P-cDNA probes prepared from gel-purified inserts. Cells were harvested on ice in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin) using a rubber policeman. Nuclei and membrane fractions were obtained using the method described by Wang et al. (17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of cell homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors). The cells were disrupted by passage through a 22-gauge needle (15 times) and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The crude nuclear pellet was extracted with an equal volume of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was used as nuclear extract for immunoblotting analysis. The microsomal membrane fraction was obtained by further centrifugation of the supernatant obtained from the nuclear pellet by ultracentrufugation at 45,000 rpm for 2 h using a TLA45 rotor (Beckman). Western blotting was performed as described (28Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE (1–15% gradient), the gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nonspecific binding sites of the membranes were blocked using 10% defatted dried milk, followed by addition of the appropriate primary antibody. The relative amount of primary antibody bound to the proteins on the nitrocellulose membrane was detected with the species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Corp.). Wild-type McArdle RH-7777 and SLW-1 cells were grown to 85% confluency on 60-mm plates, after which the cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. On the 2nd day, the cells were labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) containing serum-free DMEM in the presence of either 1 mm oleate/BSA or BSA (0.8%) alone. After labeling, cells and media were harvested as described (28Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 1 ml of TETN buffer (25 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors). Proteins were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies, as described (28Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in serum-containing medium with [1-14C]acetate (5 μCi, specific activity 47 mCi/mol) for 2 h, extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), separated on silica gel TLC plates, and the radioactivity in phospholipids, free cholesterol, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters was quantitated (29Davis R.A. Hyde P.M. Kuan J.C.W. Malone-McNeal M. Archambault-Schexnayder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3661-3667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular content of free and esterified cholesterol was determined in cells cultured to ∼85% confluency by gas liquid chromatography, as described (14Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Nenseter M.S. MacPhee A.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22695-22698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results are given as means ± S.D. Linear regression analysis was determined by Sigma Plot computer program, and significance of correlation constants was determined by Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. The number of data points obtained from individual single cell clones used for linear correlations differed from experiment to experiment due to loss of a particular single cell clone. All data points were used and none were selectively deleted. McArdle cells were transfected with a plasmid that expresses neomycin resistance and a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression of the coding region of rat 7α-hydroxylase. Following antibiotic selection, single cell clones were picked and grown. One single cell clone of McArdle cells stably expressing 7α-hydroxylase (SLW-1 cells) was used for detailed metabolic studies, whereas single cell clones were used to establish metabolic relationships (see below). Single cell clones of transfected cells expressed 7α-hydroxylase mRNA and protein of the size expected from the plasmid used (Fig. 1,A and B). While wild-type McArdle rat hepatoma cells express all of the gene products required for VLDL assembly and secretion (19Tanabe S. Sherman H. Smith L. Yang L.A. Fleming R. Hay R. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 1129-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8358-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they show no detectable expression of 7α-hydroxylase mRNA or protein (Fig. 1, A andB). Single cell clones of McArdle cells transfected with pcDNA-7α were subjected to Western blot analysis using repetitive immunodetection with antibodies to SREBP1, 7α-hydroxylase, and albumin. Since the amount of albumin in either the cell or medium was unchanged (see below), albumin served as an internal standard for recovery and blotting. The cellular content of mature SREBP1 was increased, whereas the content of the precursor form was decreased in SLW-1 cells stably expressing 7α-hydroxylase (Fig.2 A). Incubating SLW-1 cells and wild-type McArdle cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol, an established inhibitor of SREBP1 proteolytic processing (17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), decreased the content of mature SREBP1 by about 90%, whereas the precursor form was slightly increased (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, analysis of all of the single cell clones showed that the cellular content of mature SREBP1 varied as a linear function of 7α-hydroxylase protein (Fig. 2 C). Additional studies show that the cellular content of SREBP2 was not significantly affected by the expression of 7α-hydroxylase (data not shown). The secretion of apoB100, apoB48, and albumin by McArdle and SLW-1 cells was compared by Western blotting of culture medium (Fig. 3 A). The blots were scanned by densitometry, and the amount of apoB100 secreted by SLW-1 cells was increased by 2-fold, compared with wild-type McArdle cells (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the secretion of either apoB48 or albumin by the two different cell types. Since the expression of apoB mRNA was unaffected (Fig. 3 B), the increased secretion of apoB100 was the result of a post-transcriptional event. Analysis of the single cell clones showed that the secretion of apoB100 varied as a linear function of 7α-hydroxylase protein (Fig. 3 C). The content of MTP mRNA was significantly increased in SLW-1 cells expressing 7α-hydroxylase as compared with wild-type McArdle cells. Using three individual plates of cells from each group, there was a 2.2-fold increase in the content of MTP mRNA relative to β-actin in SLW-1 cells compared with wild-type McArdle cells (Fig.4 A, p < 0.05). Moreover, the relative abundance of MTP mRNA varied in proportion to the relative abundance of 7α-hydroxylase mRNA (Fig.4 B). These data indicate that expression of 7α-hydroxylase in McArdle cells induces the expression of MTP mRNA. Compared with wild-type cells, in SLW-1 cells the synthesis of all VLDL lipids (cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids) was significantly increased as determined by the incorporation of [14C]acetate (Fig.5 A). Since the cellular content of mature SREBP is sensitive to the sterol content of cells (15Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wang X. Briggs M.R. Hua X. Yokoyama C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), we determined the cellular content of free and esterified cholesterol in McArdle and SLW-1 cells (Fig. 5 B). In SLW-1 cells, expressing 7α-hydroxylase, the cellular content of both free and esterified cholesterol was 80 and 50% of the levels in McArdle cells (Fig. 5 B). This experiment was repeated two times and similar results were obtained. Recent reports indicate that several genes, whose products control both sterol and fatty acid synthesis, are targets for SREBP-induced transcription (15Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Lopez J.M. Bennett M.K. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. Proc. Soc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The expression of the mRNA's encoding HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, was increased in SLW-1 cells compared with wild-type McArdle cells (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the relative abundance of SREBP1 mRNA was similar in both cell types. Moreover, the expression of HMG-CoA reductase (Fig.6 B) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA (Fig. 6 C) varied as a linear relationship with the expression of 7α-hydroxylase mRNA. These data suggest that the expression of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of cholesterol and the fatty acid components in VLDL is coordinately influenced by the expression of 7α-hydroxylase in McArdle cells. Oleic acid stimulates the synthesis of glycerolipids and increases the secretion of apoB100 when added to the culture medium of McArdle hepatoma cells (2Innerarity T.L. Boren J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To examine if 7α-hydroxylase-mediated induction of glycerolipid synthesis (Fig.5) “saturates” the lipid requirement for maximal secretion of apoB100, we examined the effect of oleic acid on the cellular content and secretion of apoB100 in wild-type and SLW-1 cells (Fig.7). In McArdle and SLW-1 cells, oleic acid increased the cellular content of apoB100 by 2.5-fold (p < 0.01) and 1.5-fold (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 7 A). Adding oleic acid to the serum-free BSA-containing medium increased the secretion of apoB100 by McArdle cells (Fig. 7 B). The oleic acid stimulation of apoB100 secretion by McArdle cells was specific since it did not significantly affect the secretion of apoB48 or total protein (data not shown). These data confirm those of others showing that in McArdle hepatoma cells, oleic acid stimulates apoB100 secretion but not apoB48 secretion (34White A.L. Graham D.L. LeGros J. Pease R.J. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, although oleic acid increased the secretion of apoB100 by wild-type McArdle cells, it had no affect on the secretion of apoB100 by SLW-1 cells expressing 7α-hydroxylase (Fig. 7 B). Since oleic acid did significantly increase the cellular content of apoB100 in SLW-1 cells, albeit less than the increase observed in wild-type McArdle cells (Fig. 7 A), the unaltered apoB100 secretion in SLW-1 cells cannot be due to impaired apoB100 synthesis. It appears that SLW-1 cells respond similarly to oleic acid as do primary cultured hepatocytes: increased content of cellular apoB but no change in secretion (35Davis R.A. Boogaerts J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Patsch W. Tamai T. Schonfeld G. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that 7α-hydroxylase increases apoB100 secretion through a SREBP1-mediated process, McArdle and SLW-1 cells were cultured with and without 25-hydroxycholesterol (2 μg/ml) plus cholesterol (10 μg/ml) for 24 h. The proteolytic processing of transmembrane SREBP precursors to the mature transcriptionally active forms is inhibited by 25-hydroxycholesterol (17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Similar to its ability to decrease the cellular content of mature SREBP1 in SLW-1 cells (Fig. 2 B), 25-hydroxycholesterol also decreased the secretion of apoB100 to levels that were similar to those of wild-type McArdle cells (Fig.8). In the absence of 25-hydroxycholesterol, SLW-1 cells secreted 3.1-fold more apoB100 (p < 0.05) than McArdle cells. In the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol, both cell types secreted similar amounts of apoB100. Although 25-hydroxycholesterol did not significantly affect the secretion of apoB100 in wild-type McArdle cells, it decreased the secretion of apoB100 in SLW-1 cells by 71% (p < 0.02). The secretion of apoB48 and albumin by both groups of cells was similar and unaffected by 25-hydroxycholesterol. This experiment was repeated twice and similar results were obtained. The combined data suggest that the augmented secretion of apoB100 displayed by McArdle cells expressing 7α-hydroxylase can be reversed to levels detected in wild-type McArdle cells by 25-hydroxycholesterol. The additional finding that 25-hydroxycholesterol also restores the level of mature SREBP1 in SLW-1 cells to those of McArdle cells suggests that SREBP1 mediates the augmented secretion of apoB100 caused by expression of 7α-hydroxylase. SREBP was first identified as the sterol-responsive transcription factor that mediates the regulation of human LDL receptor gene (15Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its rat homologue ADD1 was identified as a transcription factor involved in adipocyte differentiation (37Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may play a diverse role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of several classes of lipids. Subsequent studies show that many of the genes encoding isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes are SREBP-responsive: HMG-CoA synthase (17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), HMG-CoA reductase (31Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1641010241,"Single-channel and whole-mitoplast patch-clamp recordings were employed to characterize the 108-pS (Cl−) channel in brown fat mitochondrial mitoplasts. We demonstrated the ability of this channel to conduct di- and trivalent anions, such as sulfate, phosphate, and benzenetricarboxylates, and its blockage by propranolol, 1,4-dihydropyridine-type Ca2+ antagonists, and Cibacron blue. Moreover, we have revealed its pH dependence for the first time. As a basis for the characteristic potential dependence of the whole-mitoplast current, we identified an open probability, increasing with depolarizing (positive) potentials, E h, and being almost zero in the hyperpolarizing range. Events at negativeE h exhibit a short flickering behavior, whereas at positive E h, they become much longer. This voltage dependence is influenced by pH in such a way that, at acidic pH, the 108-pS channel possesses a low open probability throughout the observed potential range, whereas at alkaline pH, the channel switches to long openings, even at a negative potential. All these properties lead us to conclude that the inner membrane anion channel, which has been characterized only by light scattering studies, and the 108-pS inner membrane channel, which has been characterized electrophysiologically, are one and the same process."
https://openalex.org/W2090861511,"In Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) fibroblasts, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity regulates the metabolism of endogenous linoleic acid to (13S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13S)-HPODE). (13S)-HPODE stimulates EGF-dependent mitogenesis in a SHE cell phenotype, which expresses tumor suppressor genes (supB+), but was not effective in a variant that does not express these suppressor genes (supB−). In the present study, we have investigated the potential effects of this lipid metabolite on the EGFR signaling pathways in these two SHE cell lines. Treatment of quiescent SHE cells with EGF produced a rapid, transient increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Dependence on EGF concentration for EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was similar in both SHE cell lines, but a more prolonged phosphorylation was detected in the supB−variant. Incubation of supB+ cells with (13S)-HPODE and EGF increased EGFR autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation on several signaling proteins with Src homology-2 domains including GTPase-activating protein. The lipid metabolite did not significantly alter EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in the supB− variant. Tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was also measured. The addition of (13S)-HPODE increased the extent and duration of MAP kinase tyrosine phosphorylation in supB+ cells but not in the supB− variant. MAP kinase activity in supB+ cells, as measured in immunoprecipitates from cells after the addition of EGF, was increased by the presence of (13S)-HPODE. The addition of (13S)-HPODE did not directly alter EGFR kinase activity or the internalization of the EGFR. However, the addition of (13S)-HPODE to supB+ cells extended the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR in response to EGF. The dephosphorylation of the EGFR was measured directly, and a slower rate was observed in the supB− compared with the supB+ cells. Incubation of the supB+ cells with (13S)-HPODE attenuated the dephosphorylation of the EGFR. Thus, (13S)-HPODE stimulates EGF-dependent mitogenesis and up-regulation of EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of the EGFR. This study shows that a metabolite of an essential dietary fatty acid, linoleic acid, can modulate tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of key signal transduction proteins in a growth factor mitogenic pathway."

Yeast cells take up thiamin from the extracellular environment by an active transport system with a pH optimum of 4.5 and aK m value of 0.18 μm, and thiamin in the cells is concentrated ∼10,000-fold over extracellular levels (1Iwashima A. Nishino H. Nose Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The thiamin transport system is more specific for the chemical structure of the pyrimidine moiety than the thiazole moiety of thiamin (2Iwashima A. Kawasaki Y. Kimura Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Greenberg D.M. Metabolic Pathway: Metabolism of Sulfur Compounds. 3rd Ed.

Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2716-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the isolation and characterization of S. cerevisiae THI10 gene and provide evidence that theTHI10 gene encodes for a thiamin transport carrier protein. The predicted THI10 protein is highly hydrophobic and shows significant sequence similarities to yeast uracil and allantoin transport proteins. The thiamin transport activity and the thiamin binding activity in the yeast plasma membrane fraction in thi10 null strain cells were restored when the THI10 open reading frame (ORF) was expressed by yeast GAL1 promoter. The regulation of theTHI10 gene expression was also investigated. Table I shows theS. cerevisiae strains used in this study. The thiamin transport mutant was isolated as a strain resistant to pyrithiamin after the chemical mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate as described (10Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Kaneko Y. Nosaka K.

Open table in a new tab Mating, sporulation, and dissection of yeast cells were carried out according to the standard procedures for yeast genetics (11Rose M.D. Winston F. Maniatis T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The thiamin transport activity on agar plates was detected using the staining method based on the reduction of triphenyltetrazolium chloride that is known to be taken up by yeast cells via the thiamin transport system (12Iwashima A. Nishino H. Sempuku K. Nishimura H. Experientia ( Basel ). 1981; 37: 473-474Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A gene library ofS. cerevisiae constructed by partial digestion of the genomic DNA with Sau3AI and its ligation with YEp13 (13Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) at the unique BamHI site was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Shuttle vector pRS316 (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for expression in yeast as a single-copy vector. To construct thethi10 disrupted mutant, the 4.0-kilobase pair (kb)EcoRI-SphI fragment of pTTS1 (see Fig. 1) containing the THI10 gene was ligated into the 3.1-kb pUC118 vector (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.14Google Scholar) to yield pUC118-THI10, and a 1.4-kbXbaI-XhoI fragment containing yeastHIS3 gene of pJJ217 (16Jones J.F. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was inserted into pUC118-THI10 at the corresponding sites within the THI10 coding sequence. The linear 3.0-kb SpeI-SpeI fragment of the resultant plasmid pUC-thi10::HIS3 was used to transform the haploid yeast YPH500. His+ colonies were selected, and gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blotting. To expressTHI10, YOR071c, and YOR192cgenes from the GAL1 (17Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) promoter, a yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) carrying the GAL1 portion of the divergent GAL1/GAL10 promoter region fromS. cerevisiae and the yeast CYC1 (18Zaret K.S. Sherman F. Cell. 1982; 28: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) transcription termination signal sequence, a 2-μm origin of replication was used. For subcloning of THI10, the ORF was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR, Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments) from a plasmid pTTS6 (see Fig. 1): the 5′-end primer, CTCGAATTCATGAGTTTCGGTAGTAAAGT was immediately upstream of theTHI10 ATG with the Ec0RI linker, and the 3′-end primer, CTCGCATGCCTAAGCAGCTTTTTCACTGG, was downstream of theTHI10 TAG with the SphI linker. For isolation ofYOR071c and YOR192c genes by PCR, specific primers targeted to these untranslated regions were designed according to the sequences of the GenBankTM data base. GTGTTGCTACCGCTATTTGTTCTTCGG (forward, 225 bp upstream from the presumed initiating codon) and TCTCTTGCTATATGGATGGCATAATTAGC (reverse, 259 bp downstream from the stop codon) were used for YOR071c, and ACCATTCACATAAGATAGACTGTTCCGC (forward, 561 bp upstream from the presumed initiating codon) and AATCAATGAAAATATCATCCTCAACAGAAATA (reverse, 252 bp downstream from the stop codon) were used forYOR192c gene. These amplified products from the genome DNA of wild-type yeast strain YPH500 were used as the templates for a second PCR to obtain the following ORFs. Forward primers were immediately upstream of the ATG with the HindIII linker, CTCAAGCTTATGAGCTTCAGTAGTATAGT (YOR071c) and CTCAAGCTTATGAGTTTCGGTACGAGAAT (YOR-192c), and the reverse primers were immediately downstream of the stop codons with theEcoRI linker, CTCGAATTCTCAGACAACTTGTTGAGTGG (YOR071c) and CTCGAATTCTTAGGCAATTTGTTTTTCAC (YOR192c). All PCR products were purified using Wizard™ PCR Preps (Promega), and the obtained ORFs treated with the appropriate restriction enzymes were inserted at the corresponding sites of pYES2. General methods for DNA and RNA manipulation, blot analysis, and yeast or bacterial transformation were as described elsewhere (7Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.14Google Scholar). The DNA sequence was determined by primer walking using synthesized nucleotides on an automated laser fluorescent DNA sequencer (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.) as described (7Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequencing was performed twice for each primer on both orientations using the purified plasmid pTTS6 (see Fig. 1) as a template. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with programs from a GENETYX software package (Software Development, Tokyo). The uptake of the radioactive thiamin into the yeast cells was measured as described previously (1Iwashima A. Nishino H. Nose Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The thiamin binding activity was determined by an equilibrium dialysis against 10−7m [14C]thiamin overnight in the cold as described (19Iwashima A. Nose Y. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 855-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after subtracting nonspecific thiamin binding performed in the same manner except that 10−4m nonlabeled thiamin was added in the outer solution of dialysis containing the labeled thiamin. Yeast plasma membrane was prepared by a sucrose gradient centrifugation method from the crude membrane fraction as previously reported (20Nishimura H. Nosaka K. Sempuku K. Iwashima A. Experientia ( Basel ). 1986; 42: 607-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Protein concentration in membrane preparations was measured by the procedure of Markwellet al. (21Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) purchased from ICN Biomedicals, and thiazole-2-[14C]thiamin hydrochloride (24.3 Ci/mol) was from Amersham International. All other chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers. A yeast strain T50-1B resistant to pyrithiamin, a strong thiamin antagonist bearing high affinity for thiamin transport system in yeast, is a recessive mutant defective in thiamin transport activity. T50-1B was transformed with a yeast genomic library and plated on the agar medium without thiamin and leucine. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days, and a total of 15,000 Leu+ colonies were examined for the thiamin transport activity by staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Only one colony was found to have the thiamin transport activity (by turning the colony red), and by the plasmid-curing experiment, the colony was confirmed to have a plasmid complementing the mutation of T50-1B. A plasmid prepared from the transformant was used to transformEscherichia coli DH5 to Ampr. The plasmid obtained from the Ampr, pTTS1 (Fig. 1), had an insertion of a 5.2-kb fragment in YEp13. The insert DNA contained an ORF (see below), and thus the gene obtained here was namedTHI10. Transformant carrying pTTS1 exhibited restoration of the thiamin transport activity (Table II).Table IIThiamin transport activity and thiamin binding activity in yeast plasma membrane fractionStrainPlasmidActivityThiamin transportThiamin bindingpmol/10 6 cells/minpmol/mg proteinX2180-1ANone10550.6TM1-1Nonend2-cnd, not detected.nt2-dnt, not tested.T50-1BYEp132-a2-μm-based multicopy vector used to construct the gene library.ndntpTTS1123ntNKC6NonendntpYES22-bYeast expression vector bearing GAL1 promoter.ndndpYES2-THI1082.532.6pYES2-YOR071c11.3ntpYES2-YOR192c33.9ntAfter the yeast cells were harvested at the early exponential phase in minimal medium without thiamin, the thiamin transport activity and the thiamin binding activity in the plasma membrane fraction were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Disrupted NKC6 transformed with pYES2 or pYES2 derivatives was cultured under the same conditions except that 2% glucose in the medium was replaced by 1% galactose and 10−6m thiamin.2-a 2-μm-based multicopy vector used to construct the gene library.2-b Yeast expression vector bearing GAL1 promoter.2-c nd, not detected.2-d nt, not tested. Open table in a new tab After the yeast cells were harvested at the early exponential phase in minimal medium without thiamin, the thiamin transport activity and the thiamin binding activity in the plasma membrane fraction were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Disrupted NKC6 transformed with pYES2 or pYES2 derivatives was cultured under the same conditions except that 2% glucose in the medium was replaced by 1% galactose and 10−6m thiamin. To define the limits of theTHI10 gene, various subclones were constructed using the pRS316 vector from the cloned plasmid pTTS1. The yeast transformants carrying the subcloned plasmids were tested for their thiamin transport activities (Fig. 1). Plasmid pTTS6 containing the 2.6-kbSpeI-NdeI fragment complemented the mutation of T50-1B, whereas plasmid pTTS5, constructed by subcloning the 2.3-kbSpeI-XhoI fragment, did not significantly suppress the phenotype of the mutation. Therefore, we concluded that the 2.6-kb SpeI-NdeI region contains theTHI10 gene and that the nucleotide sequence of this region was determined using pTTS6 as a DNA template. As shown in Fig.2, an ORF of 1,794 bp starting at position 548 and ending at 2,341 was found. A putative TATA box was found at positions 404–408, and two CCAAT transcription elements (22Chodosh L.A. Olesen J. Hahn S. Baldwin A.S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) were located at positions 101–105 and 529–533 in the 5′-upstream region. The polyadenylation signal AATAAA was found at positions 2,350–2,355, 2,375–2,380, 2,507–2,512, and 2,572–2,577 in the 3′-noncoding region. The yeast intron splice signal, TACTAAC (23Langford C.J. Gallwitz D. Cell. 1983; 33: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), was not found. GenBankTM data base search revealed that the nucleotide sequence of THI10 is completely identical to that of a DNA coding an unknown protein (L8083.2 gene, accession numberU19027), which has been mapped to chromosome XII. We also foundYOR071c (1,794 bp of ORF, accession number Z74979) andYOR192c (1,797 bp, accession number Z75100) genes, which are both located at S. cerevisiae chromosome XV and code for proteins of unknown function. The nucleotide sequences of both genes match over the entire length of THI10 with no gaps and about 84% sequence identity (data not shown), suggesting thatTHI10, YOR071c, and YOR192c genes are from a common evolutionary origin. The predicted protein encoded by the THI10 ORF contains 598 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 66,903. By comparison with sequences in the SWISS-PROT data base, the predicted THI10 protein was found to have significant sequence similarity to allantoin (DAL4) (24Yoo H.S. Cunningham T. Cooper T.G. Yeast. 1992; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and uracil transporter (FUR4) (25Jund R. Weber E. Chevallier M.-R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) ofS. cerevisiae over almost the entire region with 30.2 and 27.9% identity, respectively (Fig. 3). However, neither allantoin nor uracil inhibited [14C]thiamin uptake into yeast cells when each base of 1,000 times the concentration of labeled thiamin was added to the assay mixture for thiamin transport activity (data not shown). Hydropathy analysis of the deduced THI10 protein indicated that it consists of many potential transmembrane stretches, with the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions being mostly hydrophilic (Fig. 4). According to the algorithm developed by Kyte and Doolittle (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar), 10 segments of 19 sequential residues with an average hydropathy above +1.2 would span the membrane. The average hydropathy values of the transmembrane candidates are as follows: II (amino acids 78–96), 1.61; III (amino acids 107–125), 1.37; IV (amino acids 127–145), 1.25; V (amino acids 175–193), 1.45; VI (amino acids 198–216), 2.02; VII (amino acids 278–296), 2.04; VIII (amino acids 330–348), 1.26; X (amino acids 402–420), 1.88; XI (amino acids 448–466), 1.21; XII (amino acids 488–506), 1.89. Although less extended, there are two hydrophobic segments: I (amino acids 53–71) with the value of 1.04 and IX (amino acids 361–379) with the value of 0.82. Like many other transporter proteins, the NH2terminus of the THI10 gene product apparently does not contain any structure that resembles a signal peptide. PotentialN-linked glycosylation sites, Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) (27Struck D.K. Lennarz W.J. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5786-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were found at amino acid positions 39, 323, and 390. They were all located in hydrophilic regions at the NH2 terminus or between two adjacent membrane-spanning regions.Figure 4Hydrophobicity profile of the predicted THI10 protein. The ordinate shows the average hydropathy values for a window of 19 amino acids according to Kyte and Doolittle (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar). The abscissa represents the residue number at the center of the stretch. The roman numerals indicate putative transmembrane regions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm the identity of the cloned gene, we disrupted the corresponding gene locus. TheHIS3 fragment was inserted within the THI10coding region, and the disrupted thi10 fragment was introduced into the his3 strain (Fig.5 A). DNA was extracted from a His+ transformant strain (NKC6) and simultaneously digested with NdeI and SpeI. The digest was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotted. Fig. 5 Bshows that the THI10 locus of NKC6 was correctly disrupted (lane 2). NKC6 could not uptake [14C]thiamin in the transport assay (Table II), indicating that the THI10 protein is indispensable for the thiamin transport system in S. cerevisiae. Hence, we examined whether or not THI10 was the wild-type allele of the original mutation. NKC6 was crossed with T50-1B. The resultant diploid (ND10) was resistant to pyrithiamin, indicating that complementation did not occur. ND10 was then sporulated, and its tetrads were analyzed. The transport activity of all 10 tetrads was <1.0% that of the wild-type level (data not shown). Thus, the original isolate was concluded to be thi10mutant. We have previously reported the occurrence of a thiamin binding activity in the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae (20Nishimura H. Nosaka K. Sempuku K. Iwashima A. Experientia ( Basel ). 1986; 42: 607-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Iwashima A. Nishimura H. Nose Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The thiamin binding activity is repressed by exogenous thiamin, and the dissociation constant (K d) value for thiaminis of 0.11 μm is close to the apparent K m (0.18 μm) of thiamin transport in S. cerevisiae, but the entity of the protein in the cell membranes remains unclear. We investigated, therefore, the effect of the disruption ofTHI10 gene on the thiamin binding activity in the yeast plasma membrane fraction. As shown in Table II, thi10 null strain completely lost the thiamin binding activity, indicating that the THI10 protein is indispensable for the binding activity as well as the thiamin incorporation. Then we tried to produce the entire THI10 protein in thi10 null strain from the GAL1promoter. A vector pYES2-THI10 was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and transformed into NKC6, and the transformed cells were cultivated in galactose medium with 10−6m thiamin. We found that the plasma membrane fractions prepared from the transformed cells contained high thiamin binding activity, and the cells producing the THI10 protein restored the thiamin transport activity (Table II). These findings suggested that the THI10 protein is located in the plasma membrane of yeast cells and has the recognition site for thiamin. From these results and the similarity of THI10 protein with DAL4 and FUR4 proteins, we concluded that the THI10 gene of S. cerevisiae is a structural gene for a thiamin transport carrier protein. AlthoughYOR071c and YOR192c genes are extremely similar to the THI10 gene, it is not clear whether both genes are actually expressed and concerned in thiamin transport in yeast cells. Then, we isolated YOR071c and YOR192c genes by PCR from yeast genome DNA and expressed both ORFs from theGAL1 promoter in thi10 null strain in the same way as with TH110 expression. As shown in Table II, NKC6 cells producing YOR071c or YOR192c protein showed the thiamin transport activities of 13.7% and 41.0%, respectively, compared with the cells expressing THI10 protein. These results suggested that both gene products function together in a thiamin transporter complex with THI10 product or that these genes code a thiamin analog transporter bearing a low affinty for thiamin. The thiamin transport activity of S. cerevisiae is coordinately repressed with the enzymes involved in thiamin metabolism by exogenous thiamin (29Kawasaki Y. Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6145-6147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We determined that the uptake and synthesis of thiamin are controlled positively by a regulatory gene, THI3 (10Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Kaneko Y. Nosaka K. Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4701-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and negatively by the intracellular TPP level (9Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2716-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a mutant defective in another positive regulatory gene, THI2, associated with the expression of activities of the enzymes involved in thiamin biosynthesis and thiamin-repressible acid phosphatase retains sufficient thiamin transport activity (31Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Kaneko Y. Nosaka K. Iwashima A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine howTHI10 expression is regulated, we investigated the effect of thiamin in the medium on the abundance of THI10 mRNA using the wild-type strain as well as the thi2,thi3, and thi80 mutants. Cells were cultured under either low or high concentrations of thiamin, and total RNA was extracted and Northern-blotted using THI10 andURA3 DNAs as probes. As shown in Fig. 6,THI10 mRNA was detected as a single 1.9-kb band, which was almost consistent with the coding region. THI10 mRNA of the wild-type strain grown in low thiamin medium was expressed abundantly, but a high concentration of thiamin almost completely repressed THI10 mRNA (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and2). The thi3 mutant did not exhibit theTHI10 transcript (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and8). On the other hand, the decrease in the THI10mRNA level by thiamin was slight in the thi2 mutant defective in thiamin biosynthesis and the thi80 mutant carrying a level of thiamin pyrophosphokinase activity that was about one-tenth of that in the wild-type strain (Fig. 6, lanes 3–6). This effect was thought to be caused by an insufficient increase in the intracellular concentration of the co-repressor, TPP. These results indicated that THI10 expression is controlled at the mRNA level in S. cerevisiae by the TPP signal transduction pathway including the THI3 protein. We cloned the THI10 gene by complementation of the phenotype of the thiamin transport defective mutant. The following findings strongly suggested that THI10 encodes a thiamin transport carrier protein. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gene possesses the structural characteristics of an integral membrane protein, and the thiamin transport activity as well as the thiamin binding activity in the plasma membrane fraction of thi10 null strain was restored when the THI10 ORF was expressed by the GAL1promoter. This is the first report of the gene-encoding thiamin transport carrier protein for any species. The predicted protein shows significant sequence similarity to allantoin (DAL4) and uracil transporter (FUR4) ofS. cerevisiae. Andre (32Andre B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1575-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) recently reported that the transporters of purines, pyrimidines, and derivatives can be classified into two superfamily (FUR and FCY) families. The FUR family containsDAL4, FUR4, YBL042c (uridine permease), and THI10, which is described as theL8083.2 gene in the review. The THI10 protein certainly seems to recognize the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin (2Iwashima A. Kawasaki Y. Kimura Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Iwashima A. Nosaka K. Nishimura H. Kimura Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 1541-1546PubMed Google Scholar). However, these four gene products appear not to share function. Cooper et al. (34Cooper T.G. Chilsholm V.T. Cho H.J. Yoo H.S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that allantoin accumulation was negligible in the dal4 mutant strain even though it possessed a wild-typeFUR4 allele. We demonstrated here that both allantoin and uracil even at high concentrations did not inhibit thiamin uptake into yeast cells. On the other hand, adenosine and cordycepin, an analog of adenosine, share a common transport system with thiamin in growingS. cerevisiae cells (35Iwashima A. Kawasaki Y. Nosaka K. Nishimura H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 60-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Among nucleosides other than adenosine, only cytidine was taken up by the thiamin transport system but to a level that was only 5.9% that of adenosine. It is probable that the THI10 product participates in the uptake of adenosine in S. cerevisiae. Although the expression of YOR071c or YOR192cgene from GAL1 promoter partially compensated for the deficiency of THI10 protein in yeast cells, the functions of these genes remain unknown. For elucidation of the relationship between these genes and thiamin transport in yeast, it is essential to ascertain whether the disrupted strains of these genes abolish the thiamin transport activity and whether the expression of these genes is controlled by the thiamin regulatory pathway. Recently, Ruml and Silhankova (36Ruml T. Silhankova L. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) reported a recessive mutation, thp1, leading to complete loss of thiamin uptake in S. cerevisiae that was mapped to chromosome VII. It has not been clear whether theTHP1 gene encodes a structural gene of the thiamin transporter or a positive regulatory factor specific for expression ofTHI10. The results of Northern blot hybridization indicated that theTHI10 gene expression of S. cerevisiae is regulated at the mRNA level by TPP, similar to other genes involved in thiamin metabolism (7Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Nosaka K. Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Tsujihara T. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the PHO3gene is known to be regulated at the transcriptional level, and we analyzed the region responsible for the transcriptional activation of the PHO3 gene in response to thiamin in the medium (38Nosaka K. Yamanishi K. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The presumed upstream activating sequence, AAA(A/C)TCAA, is found in the 5′-upstream noncoding regions of PHO3 (3Bajwa W. Meyhack B. Rudolph H. Schweingruber A.-M. Hinnen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7721-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) andTHI6 (37Nosaka K. Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Tsujihara T. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) genes by two copies for each gene. TheTHI6 gene product is a bifunctional enzyme with thiamin-phosphate pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.5.1.3) and 4-methyl-5-β-hydroxyethylthiazole kinase (EC 2.7.1.50) activities (30Kawasaki Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5153-5158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is a TTGATTT sequence at positions 238–244 of the THI10 5′-upstream noncoding region (Fig. 2). This sequence is an inverse complement of the AAATCAA. Although the physiological significance of these sequences is not clear, a finding that the THI10 does not require the positive factor THI2 for its expression suggests that the regulatory mechanism ofTHI10 expression is different from those of PHO3,THI6, and THI80. The expressions of these structural genes, except for THI10, are considered to be controlled by both THI2 and THI3 factors. We expect that the detailed analysis of THI10 gene expression will facilitate elucidation of the TPP signal transduction pathway in yeast thiamin metabolism. We thank Dr. Y. Kaneko, Osaka University, for constructing the yeast strain T50-1B and the gift of the plasmids pJJ217 and pJJ242 and Hiroshi Tatsumi for help in cloningTHI10 gene."

Previous studies aimed at fine mapping the amino acid residues required for cell adhesion have yielded discrepant results. Here we show in three different cell lines that the downstream basic residues are required for cell adhesion whereas the CSVTCG sequence is not. Using mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells selected for deficiencies in proteoglycan synthesis, we show that in wild type cells, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are the binding sites for this motif. This finding is supported by additional experiments with two other cell lines demonstrating that treatment with heparitinase but not chondroitinase abolishes cell adhesion to peptides representing this motif. Using Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants deficient in heparan sulfate proteoglycans but possessing chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, we show that cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans can also mediate binding to this motif although higher concentrations of peptides are required for adhesion. Chondroitinase, but not heparitinase, treatment of these cells destroys cell surface-binding sites. Taken together, these results indicate that cell adhesion to this motif involves an interaction between the downstream positively-charged residues and the negatively charged glycosaminoglycan chains of heparan sulfate, or in some cases chondroitin sulfate, proteoglycans on the cell surface.

Thrombospondin (TSP), a 420-kDa glycoprotein that functions in the attachment, migration, and proliferation of many different cell types, has several cell adhesive domains (reviewed in Refs. 6Lawler J.

In the life cycle of the malaria parasite, it is responsible for the rapid and specific homing of sporozoites to hepatocytes where the first stage of malaria infection is initiated (15Cerami C.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The shared adhesive motif includes two cysteines at the amino-terminal and a series of positively charged amino acids at the COOH-terminal (Fig. 1 A). Studies aimed at the identification of the amino acids required for cell adhesion have yielded discrepant results. Several groups of investigators, using thrombospondin-derived sequences, have reached the conclusion that the CSVTCG segment of the motif is responsible for cell adhesive activity (2Rich K.A. George F.W.I. Law J.L. Martin W.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Tuszynski G.P. Rothman V.L. Deutch A.H. Hamilton B.K. Eyal J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, our work in malaria with region II-plus peptides has demonstrated the importance of the downstream positively-charged amino acids (4Sinnis P. Clavijo P. Fenyo D. Chait B.T. Cerami C. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We have shown that these residues are required for CS binding to hepatocytes and that they interact with the negatively-charged glycosaminoglycan chains (GAGs) of proteoglycans on the cell membrane. One important discrepancy between the two series of studies lies in the methodology used to detect the interaction between target cells, and peptides representing various stretches of the adhesion motif. The standard assay used by most investigators measures the binding of live cells to immobilized peptides, while in our previous studies, peptides were in solution and we measured their binding to fixed and immobilized target cells. Although similar peptide ligands were used in all of these studies, cell adhesion is a multivalent process and may involve a different set of receptors than a protein-ligand interaction such as CS binding to hepatocytes. In addition, different cell lines were used in these studies. Our experiments were performed with a hepatoma cell line, HepG2, whereas others used a variety of cell lines none of which was derived from hepatocytes. In an attempt to resolve these discrepancies, we used a variety of cell lines in a standard cell adhesion assay to analyze the interaction between live cells and peptides representing this cell-adhesive motif from CS (PCSVTCGNGIQVRIK). We tested modifications of both the peptide ligand and the cell surface-binding sites to determine the role of the downstream basic residues and the CSVTCG segment of this motif in cell adhesion. Peptides were synthesized by Boc chemistry using the multiple peptide synthesis method described by Houghten (20Houghten R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Cleavage from the resin was performed with hydrofluoric acid in two steps. A low concentration of hydrofluoric acid, used to remove protecting groups from the amino acid side chains, was followed by a high concentration of hydrofluoric acid which removed the peptides from the resin. Purity was verified by high performance liquid chromatography and amino acid analysis. CSVTCG peptides were synthesized in two ways, with blocked cysteines using acetamide groups and also with free sulfhydryls. These peptides were further purified on an FPLC C18 column using an acetonitrile gradient of 1 to 20% with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. CSVTCG without blocked cysteines was reduced with 50 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h before purification on the FPLC C18 column. The presence or absence of free sulfhydryl groups in CSVTCG peptides was confirmed with the Ellman reaction (21Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar) before each experiment. The full-length region II-plus peptides used as soluble inhibitors in cell binding assays were partially oxidized and contained tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers by gel filtration chromatography and mass spectrometry (4Sinnis P. Clavijo P. Fenyo D. Chait B.T. Cerami C. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1 mm glutamine. The growth, isolation of subclones, and cryogenic storage of cells is described in Ref. 22Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar. The mutants used in this study had the following characteristics: mutant pgsA-745 lacks xylosyltransferase activity and produces less than 2% of wild-type levels of glycosaminoglycans (23Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). pgsD-677 does not produce any heparan sulfate chains and makes greater than normal amounts of chondroitin sulfate due to a deficiency in the chain polymerization activities involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis (24Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). pgsE-606 has diminished GlcNAcN-sulfotransferase activity, which results in the formation of heparan sulfate chains with less overall sulfation (25Bame K.J.

Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Human cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). MG63 cells (CRL 1427) are a human osteosarcoma line and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% FCS and 1 mm glutamine. K562 cells (CCL 243), a myeloid cell line, were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% FCS, and 1 mm glutamine. 96-Well plates (Falcon Pro-Bind, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) were coated with peptide at the indicated concentrations in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at room temperature or for 2 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed twice with PBS and blocked for 1–2 h at 37 °C with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (product A-7888, Sigma). Log-phase cells were washed twice in PBS and detached with 5 mm EDTA/PBS at 37 °C. FCS was then added to the cells to a final concentration of 5%. The CHO cells required longer incubations in EDTA for detachment and so a different buffer was used since incubation in PBS for 10 min was found to be toxic to these cells. Both CHO mutants and wild-type cells were washed once in 10 mm Hepes, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.3) and then incubated in this same buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. By trypan blue exclusion 95% of the detached cells were viable after this treatment. After the cells were detached FCS was added as above. Cells were then washed 3 times with their normal growth medium without FCS (incomplete medium) and resuspended at a density of 106/ml in incomplete medium. 105cells were plated in each well and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. The plates were then centrifuged upside down at 100 × g for 5 min, and the cells remaining in the wells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Eastman Kodak Co.) in PBS for 10 min followed by 20% methanol for 10 min. The cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma) in 50% methanol for 5 min, washed 3 times with tap water, the stain was eluted from the cells with 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 4.2) in 50% ethanol and absorbance of the eluant was measured at 540 nm in an Emax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA). Experiments performed to assess the efficiency of cell binding demonstrated that when wells were coated with 10 μg/ml full-length peptide, over 95% of the cells added, bound to the wells (data not shown). In addition, control experiments performed with fibronectin demonstrated that all of the wild-type cell lines bound with the same efficiency to 10 μg/ml fibronectin as they did to region II-plus peptides (data not shown). Cells were prepared as outlined above and after 3 washes in incomplete medium were resuspended in incomplete medium with the indicated concentration of peptide. Incubations with peptide were for 30 min at 37 °C on an orbital rotator in sterile Eppendorf tubes that had been blocked with PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C to avoid peptide and cell adhesion to the sides of the tubes. The cells were then plated without being washed, in wells that had been coated with 1.25 μg/ml region II-plus peptide and blocked as above. Cells were prepared as above and after 3 washes in incomplete medium they were incubated for 10 min on ice with the indicated amounts of heparin (Sigma) or chondroitin sulfate A, B, or C (Sigma) before being plated with the inhibitor in wells that had been coated with 1.25 μg/ml region II-plus peptide and blocked as above. In experiments with CHO mutant pgsD, the wells were coated with 4 μg/ml peptide because this was the lowest concentration of peptide that resulted in maximal binding of the cells. Cells were prepared as outlined above and after 3 washes in incomplete medium, were incubated with heparitinase (heparinase III; ICN, Costa Mesa CA) or chondroitinase ABC (ICN) in incomplete media supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4 for 3 h on an orbital rotator at 37 °C. They were then plated, in the presence of the enzyme, in wells coated with 1.25 μg/ml region II-plus peptide, and blocked with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. When binding of enzyme-treated CHO mutant pgsD was investigated, plates were coated with 4 μg/ml region II-plus peptide for reasons stated above. Subconfluent cells were trypsinized and resuspended in complete medium and 2 × 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well plates (Falcon 3064, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ). The cells were allowed to grow for 18–24 h, the medium was removed and 2 ml of sulfate labeling medium (2.5% dialyzed FCS and 50 μCi of 35SO4/ml in Ham's F-12) was added per well. 24 h later the cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with 100 μg ofl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) in 1 ml of PBS for 5 min at room temperature. 50 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) was then added to each well and the cells, which were now detached, were spun at 70 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were collected and stored at −70 °C for later GAG analysis. Each supernatant was treated with one-sixth volume of a Pronase solution (Pronase, 1 mg/ml (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.24m sodium acetate (pH 6.5), and 1.92 m sodium chloride). 1 mg of chondroitin sulfate was added to each solution as a carrier. After overnight incubation, the reaction mixture was diluted 5-fold with water to reduce the salt concentration to ∼0.1m. The solution was applied to a 0.5-ml DEAE-Sephacel column prepared in a disposable polypropylene pipette tip plugged with glass wool. The column was washed with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 250 mm sodium chloride. Bound GAGs were eluted with 1 m sodium chloride in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and precipitated with 4 volumes of ethanol at 4 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.5 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and reprecipitated with ethanol. GAG chains were treated with 1 m sodium borohydride in 0.5 m sodium hydroxide for 24 h at 4 °C to β-eliminate the chains. The samples were diluted with water and purified by another round of DEAE chromatography. The heparan sulfate chains were prepared by treating the samples with 20 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku, Japan) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) overnight at 37 °C to depolymerize [35S]chondroitin sulfate. Another round of DEAE-Sephacel chromatography separated the intact HS chains from the degraded chondroitin sulfate. The amount of [35S]heparan sulfate was measured by scintillation counting and the relative amount of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate was calculated. In initial experiments we measured the adhesion of live cells to region II-plus peptides (PCSVTCGNGIQVRIKPGSAN) immobilized onto wells of microtiter plates. For these studies we used two cell lines, one of which, K562 cells, had been previously shown to adhere to the CSVTCG portion of this motif (2Rich K.A. George F.W.I. Law J.L. Martin W.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The other cell line, MG63, is a standard cell line used in adhesion studies although the fine specificity of its interaction with this motif had not been previously studied. The full-length region II-plus peptide used in this study (Fig.1 B) contains a 5-amino acid extension, PGSAN, present for reasons extraneous to the current study. We have previously shown that these additional amino acids do not interfere with or enhance binding activity of the peptide (4Sinnis P. Clavijo P. Fenyo D. Chait B.T. Cerami C. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, both MG63 and K562 cells adhere to region II-plus peptides in a dose-dependent manner. To determine which portion of this motif is required for cell adhesion, we tested the truncated and substituted peptides shown in Fig. 1 B for cell adhesive activity. When the NH2-terminal portion was truncated but the downstream portion with the basic and hydrophobic residues was intact (CGNGIQVRIKPGSAN), the cells bound to the peptide-coated wells with identical efficiency (Fig. 2). However, neither cell line adhered to peptides in which the downstream basic residues had been replaced by either negatively charged or neutral amino acids (PCSVTCGNGIQVEIEPGSAN and PCSVTCGNGIQVNIN), even though the entire NH2-terminal CSVTCG sequence was present (Fig.2). The apparent lack of activity of CSVTCG is in contradiction with the results of Tuszynski et al. (19Tuszynski G.P. Rothman V.L. Deutch A.H. Hamilton B.K. Eyal J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In their studies, however, the short CSVTCG peptide was the immobilized target, rather than the longer constructs described above. We therefore synthesized CSVTCG peptides to use in adhesion assays with MG63 and K562 cells. We synthesized two CSVTCG peptides, one in which the cysteines were blocked with acetamide groups and another with free sulfhydryl groups (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 2, however, neither cell line adhered to the wells coated with these peptides. To investigate whether these short peptides had indeed bound to the plastic, we performed experiments with a slightly longer and more hydrophobic,125I-labeled YCSVTCG peptide. We found that, as is frequently the case for short peptides, YCSVTCG bound very poorly to plastic (data not shown) and therefore could not be reliably used as a substrate for cell adhesion. For this reason, we tested CSVTCG as a soluble inhibitor of cell adhesion to immobilized PCSVTCGNGIQVRIKPGSAN. As shown in Fig. 3, adhesion of both cell lines is inhibited by soluble full-length peptide, whereas CSVTCG peptide, at high concentrations has no inhibitory activity. Because the oxidation state of the cysteines in CSVTCG could influence the cell adhesive activity of this sequence, we used CSVTCG peptides whose cysteines were blocked and peptides whose cysteines contained free sulfhydryls. Neither peptide inhibited cell adhesion to the full-length sequence. The requirement of the downstream basic residues for cell adhesive activity suggested that an ionic interaction between this sequence and negatively-charged cell surface molecules was involved. Others have shown that this motif binds to sulfated glycoconjugates (17Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J.

Chem. 1986; 261: 3306-3309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our previous studies using fixed immobilized cells demonstrated that soluble region II-plus peptides bound to the heparan sulfate (HS) GAGs of cell surface HSPGs (4Sinnis P. Clavijo P. Fenyo D. Chait B.T. Cerami C. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34Frevert U. Sinnis P. Cerami C. Shreffler W. Takacs B. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To investigate which sulfated glycoconjugate on the cell surface bound to this motif in live-cell adhesion assays, we used mutant CHO cells selected for deficiencies in GAG synthesis. As shown in Fig. 4, wild-type CHO cells, similarly to MG63 and K562 cells, adhere to the full-length region II-plus peptide (PCSVTCGNGIQVRIKPGSAN). Mutant CHO cell line pgsA, lacking proteoglycan GAGs, does not bind to the peptide. When GAGs are partially undersulfated, as in mutant cell lines pgsE and pgsF, there is decreased cell binding when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the GAGs of cell surface proteoglycans mediate binding to region II-plus peptides and that this is due, at least in part, to an ionic interaction between the basic residues of this cell adhesive motif and the negatively charged sulfate moieties of cell surface GAGs. We then used GAG lyases to investigate the identity of the cell surface GAGs which mediate adhesion to this motif since these cell lines have chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans as well as HSPGs (TableI). As shown in Fig. 5, heparitinase treatment abolishes adhesion of MG63, K562, and wild-type CHO cells to this sequence whereas chondroitinase treatment does not significantly decrease cell binding, suggesting that HS and not chondroitin sulfate GAGs mediate binding to this motif. To confirm this finding, we performed studies with the CHO mutant pgsD, which has very low amounts of cell surface HS (<2% of wild-type cells) but increased amounts of chondroitin sulfate GAGs (24Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To our surprise, we found that these cells bound to region II-plus peptides although with lower efficiency when compared with wild-type CHO cells (Fig.6 A). The role of chondroitin sulfate GAGs in binding of the CHO pgsD cells to region II-plus peptides was confirmed with the demonstration that heparitinase treatment of these cells had little effect on cell adhesion whereas chondroitinase treatment completely abolished binding to region II-plus peptides (Fig.6 B). These results suggest that both HSPGs and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans can mediate binding to this motif. However, HSPG-deficient pgsD cells require higher concentrations of peptide for binding when compared with wild-type cells, suggesting that HSPGs bind with higher avidity to this motif than chondroitin sulfate.Table IRelative amounts of cell surface GAGs on cells used in this studyCell typeHeparan sulfateChondroitin sulfate1-aCalculated from [35S]GAG-[35S]HS.%CHO K1 6337CHO pgsF 5050CHO pgsE 4951CHO pgsD<21-bRef. 24.>981-bRef. 24.MG63 5050K562 25751-a Calculated from [35S]GAG-[35S]HS.1-b Ref. 24Lidholt K.

IntracellularListeria monocytogenes secretes p60, a murein hydrolase, into the host cell cytosol, where it is degraded by proteasomes. Roughly 3% of degraded p60 gives rise to p60 217–225, a nonamer peptide that is bound by H-2Kd MHC class I molecules. Herein, we introduce targeted deletions throughout the p60 gene to identify potential proteolytic signals within p60. Degradation of mutant forms of p60 was investigated in macrophages infected with recombinant L. monocytogenes. We found that deletions within the amino-terminal two-thirds of p60 enhanced cytosolic degradation. In contrast, truncation of the C terminus resulted in modest stabilization of p60 in the host cell cytosol. Because a protein's N-terminal amino acid can determine its rate of degradation, we mutagenized this residue in p60 into known stabilizing and destabilizing residues. Valine substitution dramatically stabilized cytosolic p60 molecules, while substitution with aspartic acid resulted in rapid degradation. The number of p60 217–225 epitopes isolated from infected cells directly correlated with the rates of p60 degradation. Our data, therefore, indicate that the N-terminal amino acid and multiple internal regions of p60 influence its stability in the cytosol of infected cells. Antigen degradation and epitope generation are linked, and different degradation signals can channel bacterial proteins into the MHC class I antigen processing pathway.

Proteasomes are multienzyme complexes consisting of a 20 S catalytic core that associates with regulatory subunits to make a 26 S particle. Membrane-permeable proteasome inhibitors prevent the generation of most antigenic peptides and, because of a shortage of peptide, impair MHC class I egress from the endoplasmic reticulum (4Rock K.L.

Peptides generated in the cytosol by proteasomes are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing (15Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and, if they conform to the appropriate motif, are bound by MHC class I molecules (16Falk K. Rötzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). The assembled complexes travel to the cell surface, where they are presented to CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). Cytosolic protein degradation is generally very specific and regulated. Thus, most endogenous proteins contain or acquire degradation signals prior to proteasome-mediated destruction. One of the best characterized mechanisms for marking proteins for cytosolic degradation involves the ubiquitination of target proteins (17Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). In this pathway, polyubiquitin chains are conjugated to one or more lysine residues of the target protein. Ubiquitin conjugation requires the action of multiple enzymes and is initiated by the recognition of specific protein sequences (17Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 18Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 19Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69 (725): 725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Several signals that promote ubiquitination have been identified and include the N-terminal amino acid (19Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69 (725): 725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), internal sequences called “destruction boxes” (20Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirscher M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar), or even sequences on proteins associated with the degradation substrate (21Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-independent pathways for targeting intracellular protein degradation, possibly involving PEST sequences, have also been described (22Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar, 23Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17382-17385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest a role for the ubiquitin targeting pathway in MHC class I antigen processing. For example, cells with a defect in the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme are incapable of processing microinjected chicken ovalbumin (25Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1993; 363: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Additionally, antigens can be targeted for MHC class I antigen processing by modification of the N-terminal amino acid into a destabilizing residue (26Grant E.P. Michalek M.T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3750-3758PubMed Google Scholar). While a correlation between antigen degradation and epitope generation has been demonstrated in multiple studies (6Sijts A.J.A.M. Villanueva M.S. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1497-1503PubMed Google Scholar, 26Grant E.P. Michalek M.T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J.

Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), there are conflicting reports demonstrating that protein degradation rates do not influence antigenicity (28Del Val M.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 1894-1904PubMed Google Scholar). We have used macrophage cell lines infected with the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes as a model to investigate cytosolic antigen degradation and production of MHC class I-presented CTL epitopes. L. monocytogenes enters the cytosol of phagocytic cells by secreting listeriolysin O (LLO), which destroys the phagolysosomal membrane (30Portnoy D.A. Jones S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 730: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Bacteria multiply intracellularly and secrete proteins that are processed into peptides that are presented by MHC class I molecules (31Pamer E.G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In BALB/c (H2d) mice, LLO is processed into LLO 91–99 and p60, a murein hydrolase, is processed into p60 217–225 and p60 449–457 (32Pamer E.G. Harty J.T. Bevan M.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 33Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 686-694PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sijts A.J.A.M. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 685-692Google Scholar). These three peptides are bound by H2-Kd MHC class I molecules and are recognized byL. monocytogenes-specific CTL. Following secretion into the host cell cytosol, p60 is degraded with a half-life of approximately 90 min (35Villanueva M.S. Fisher P. Feen K. Pamer E.G. Immunity. 1994; 1: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Approximately 3% of degraded p60 molecules are processed into p60 217–225 (35Villanueva M.S. Fisher P. Feen K. Pamer E.G. Immunity. 1994; 1: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and approximately 30% are processed into p60 449–457 (34Sijts A.J.A.M. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 685-692Google Scholar). LLO is also rapidly degraded in the host cytosol, and approximately 10–20% of degraded LLO molecules give rise to LLO 91–99 (36Villanueva M.S. Sijts A.J.A.M. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5227-5233PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic degradation of LLO and p60 is proteasome-mediated (6Sijts A.J.A.M. Villanueva M.S. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1497-1503PubMed Google Scholar), and there is a tight correlation between 1) the amount of antigen degraded and the number of CTL epitopes (35Villanueva M.S. Fisher P. Feen K. Pamer E.G. Immunity. 1994; 1: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and 2) the rate of antigen degradation and the rate of CTL epitope appearance (6Sijts A.J.A.M. Villanueva M.S. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1497-1503PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear how p60 is targeted for degradation by host cell proteasomes. To determine if p60 contains a protein degradation signal recognized by the host cell, we made deletion mutants that spanned the majority of the mature protein and expressed them in L. monocytogenes. While most regions within p60 contribute to its stability in the host cell cytosol, the carboxyl-terminal region enhances degradation. Substitution of the N-terminal amino acid of p60 with stabilizing and destabilizing residues demonstrates that p60 is an N-end rule substrate. In agreement with our previous findings that degradation of p60 is tightly linked with epitope generation (6Sijts A.J.A.M. Villanueva M.S. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1497-1503PubMed Google Scholar), we find a direct correlation between the rate of intracellular degradation of mutant forms of p60 and epitope generation. L. monocytogenes strain 43251 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD) and grown in brain heart infusion medium. Recombinant bacteria strains were grown in medium with spectinomycin (200 μg/ml). P815 mastocytoma cells (DBA/2, H-2d) and J774 macrophage-like cells (BALB/c, H-2d) were obtained from the ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm HEPES, penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamicin (RP10). CTL clone L9.6 is specific for p60 217–225 in the context of the H2-Kd molecule and was maintained by weekly restimulation with L. monocytogenes-infected J774 cells as described (33Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 686-694PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic p60 217–225 (KYGVSVQDI) and p60 217Ser–225 (SYGVSVQDI) were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Peptides were HPLC-purified, and stock solutions were quantified by amino acid analysis. Ac-LLnL-CHO was purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO. Cycloheximide and anisomycin were obtained from Sigma. All p60 constructs were generated from an L. monocytogenes-derived p60 gene with a mutation to encode a serine in position 217 as described (34Sijts A.J.A.M. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 685-692Google Scholar). Point mutations in the codon encoding amino acid 28 and deletions in the gene region encoding amino acids 45–365 were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis as instructed (Muta-Gene Phagemid in vitro Mutagenesis Kit, version 2; Bio-Rad). The p60 217Ser gene was cloned into phagemid pTZ-19-u and single-stranded DNA was made. The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used to make point mutations: Ser28 → Arg, 5′-GACTACTACAGTGCGTGCGCTAGCGATTGTTGG-3′; p60 Ser28 → Asp, 5′-GACTACTACAGTGTCTGCGCTAGCGATTGTTGG-3′; p60 Ser28 → Met, 5′-GACTACTACAGTCATTGCGCTAGCGATTGTTGG-3′; p60 Ser28 → Val, 5′-GACTACTACAGTGACTGCGCTAGCGATTGTTGG-3′. The following oligonucleotides with in frame deletions contain a restriction site for NheI, encoded by silent mutations in the codons for amino acid 25 and 26: p60 Δ45–90, 5′-GCGCCACTACGGACGTTACTTTGTGCGATACCCC-3′; p60 Δ91–141, 5′-GGAGTGCTTACTGCTTTGTCTAACCAAGTTGCGCT-3′; p60 Δ138–179, 5′-GGCGCAGGTGTAGTTGCACCGTTAACGAAACCAG-3′; p60 Δ170–216, 5′-CTTGAACAGAAACACCGTAGCTTTCTGCAGCAGGTGCAGC-3′; p60 Δ226–266, 5′-AACTACTGGAGCTGCTTGAATGTCTTGAACAGAAAC-3′; p60 Δ265–305, 5′-GTAGATGGTGCAGGAGCAGCTGCTGGAGCTTCCGT-3′; p60 Δ304–365, 5′-AGCACTTGCACTTGAATTTGCAGCTTCTGTTGGTGC-3′. Carboxyl-terminal deletions (Δ358–484) were introduced by the polymerase chain reaction using p60 217Ser and p60 Arg28, p60 Asp28, p60 Met28, and p60 Val28217Ser point mutants as templates. The 5′ oligonucleotide (5′-GGGTCGACTCGATCATCATAATTCTGTCTC-3′) encodes a SalI restriction site and includes 442 base pairs upstream of the p60 translation initiation site. The 3′ oligonucleotide (5′-GGAAGAACCTTAATTAGCATTCGT-3′) introduces a stop codon at p60 amino acid 358. Polymerase chain reaction products were inserted into the TA vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Mutant p60 genes were cloned between theSalI and EcoRI sites of the shuttle vector pAT29, transformed into Escherichia coli HB101 (pRK24) and conjugated into L. monocytogenes 43251 as described (35Villanueva M.S. Fisher P. Feen K. Pamer E.G. Immunity. 1994; 1: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). L. monocytogenes were grown overnight to stationary phase. Cultures were centrifuged to remove bacteria and separated by SDS-PAGE (35Villanueva M.S. Fisher P. Feen K. Pamer E.G. Immunity. 1994; 1: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, and membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with anti-p60 rabbit antiserum at a 1:4000 dilution (35Villanueva M.S. Fisher P. Feen K. Pamer E.G. Immunity. 1994; 1: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) in the secondary step and developed by enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). L. monocytogenes-infected J774 cells were metabolically labeled as described previously (35Villanueva M.S. Fisher P. Feen K. Pamer E.G. Immunity. 1994; 1: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In short, 4 × 106 J774 cells were seeded in flasks and incubated overnight in RP10 medium with 100 μg/ml spectinomycin as the only antibiotic (RP-spec). Cells were infected with log phase cultures of recombinant L. monocytogenes(A 600 = 0.1) for 30 min, washed, and incubated in RP-spec for 3 h. Gentamicin (50 μg/ml) was added after the first 30 min to inhibit extracellular bacterial growth. J774 cells then were washed and placed in methionine-free medium (methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 3% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5) with spectinomycin, gentamicin, the eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) and anisomycin (30 μg/ml), and 25 μm calpain inhibitor I (LLnL) as indicated in the figure legends. After 30 min, translabel [35S]methionine at a specific activity of 200–500 μCi was added, and the cells were pulsed for periods varying from 20 min to 1 h. Cells were washed and chased for the time intervals indicated in the figure legends in RP10− with 20 μg/ml tetracycline to inhibit further intracellular bacterial growth. Cells were harvested in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer with protease inhibitors, and the detergent lysates were cleared by centrifugation (8 min at 14,000 rpm) at 4 °C. p60 was immunoprecipitated with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry) and 5 μl of anti-p60 antiserum for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times and resuspended in sample buffer, and the samples were electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Gels were enhanced with 0.5 m salicylate, 3% glycerol, dried, and exposed for autoradiography. Radioactive signals were quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-250 Molecular Imager. RecombinantL. monocytogenes were grown to log phase in brain heart infusion medium with 200 μg/ml spectinomycin. Bacteria from a 1-ml culture were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in methionine-free medium. After 30 min at 37 °C, bacteria were pulse-labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine for 20 min, washed, and chased for 0, 30, and 60 min in RP10− with tetracycline. p60 was immunoprecipitated from the pulse medium and chase medium as described above. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were exposed for autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. CTL epitopes were extracted and HPLC-purified as described previously (33Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 686-694PubMed Google Scholar). In short, J774 cells were grown to confluence in 150-cm2 plates in RP10−with spectinomycin added the night before infection. Cells were infected with log phase cultures of recombinant L. monocytogenes for 30 min. The medium was then replaced with RP10− containing 5 μg/ml gentamicin, and the cells were cultured for 6 h and then harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. To elute peptides, the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, Dounce-homogenized, and sonicated. Lysates were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 35 min, and the resulting supernatants were lyophilized. Protein pellets were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, passed through Centricon-10 membranes, and separated by reverse phase HPLC. Fractions were collected, lyophilized, resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −20 °C. CTL assays were performed as described previously (33Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 686-694PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10451Cr sodium chromate-labeled P815 target cells were incubated with 50 μl of the HPLC-separated peptides and assayed for recognition by p60 217–225-specific CTL clone L9.6 (33Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 686-694PubMed Google Scholar). Using our standard protocol, p60 217–225 and p60 217Ser–225 elute in distinct fractions (34Sijts A.J.A.M. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 685-692Google Scholar). p60 peptide-containing fractions were titrated on P815 target cells and assayed in triplicate along with standard concentrations of synthetic p60 217–225 and p60 217Ser–225. Molar amounts of peptide were determined, and epitope numbers per cell were calculated as described previously (33Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 686-694PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate how L. monocytogenes p60 is targeted for cytosolic degradation and processing into MHC class I-associated peptides, p60 gene deletion mutants were constructed (Fig.1). Contiguous sections of p60 were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis from a gene encoding p60 217Ser. We used p60 217Ser because p60 217–225 generated from this protein contains serine instead of the wild type lysine in position 217, which alters the HPLC elution time of the epitope without affecting its recognition by the CTL clone L9.6 (34Sijts A.J.A.M. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 685-692Google Scholar). The p60 signal sequence (amino acids 1–27) was maintained in all p60 constructs to ensure bacterial secretion (Fig. 1 B). The deleted and truncated p60 genes were cloned into pAT29, a plasmid that replicates in Gram-negative and positive bacteria, and then introduced into L. monocytogenes. The resulting recombinant strains express both wild type p60, encoded by the chromosomal gene copy, and a plasmid-encoded, mutated form of p60. All recombinant strains multiplied at rates comparable with that of wild type L. monocytogenes and had a normal morphology (not shown), indicating that mutant forms of p60 did not interfere with bacterial growth and septation. To determine the rate of mutant p60 secretion, the supernatants of transformed L. monocytogenes cultures were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed in a Western blot with a polyclonal p60-specific antiserum (Fig.2). The rate of mutant p60 secretion varied depending on which region of p60 was deleted. The amount of secreted, mutant p60 was proportional to the amount remaining associated the bacterial pellets (results not shown). p60 mutants lacking the N-terminal region (Δ28–45) or the p60 217–225 epitope encoding region were not secreted at detectable levels and therefore were not included in our analyses. Altogether, approximately 94% of the p60 protein was deleted in this panel of p60 mutants.Figure 2Secretion of p60 deletion mutants by recombinant L. monocytogenes. Culture supernatants from stationary phase bacteria were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with a polyclonal p60-specific rabbit antiserum. The supernatant from wild type (w.t.) L. monocytogenes is shown in theleft lane, while the right lanes show supernatant from the various p60 recombinant strains. The intensely staining protein found in all lanes is wild type p60, encoded by the bacterial chromosome. The deleted forms of p60 are of lower molecular weight and, depending on the deletion, are present in varying amounts. Molecular weight markers are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Wild type p60 is degraded in the cytosol of infected cells with a half-life of approximately 90 min (35Villanueva M.S. Fisher P. Feen K. Pamer E.G. Immunity. 1994; 1: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To investigate the intracellular degradation of the deleted and truncated forms of p60, J774 macrophage-like cells were infected with recombinant L. monocytogenes. Infected cells were metabolically labeled and chased for increasing time intervals, and p60 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and PhosphorImager analysis. Confirming our previous results, we found that wild type p60 secreted by the recombinant L. monocytogenes strains was degraded in the cytosol with a half-life of 60–90 min (Fig.3). In contrast, deleted p60 Δ138–179, Δ265–305, and Δ304–365, was degraded much more rapidly (Fig. 3,A–C). Further experiments established half-lives of 15–20 min for these p60 products (Fig. 3 E, TableI). In marked contrast to deletions in the N terminus or midsection of p60, deletion of amino acids 358–484 of p60 (p60 Δ358–484) produced a modest increase in the stability of p60 in the host cell cytosol (Fig. 3 D).Table IIntracellular half-lives of p60 variantsp60 mutantsIntracellular half-life1-aInfected J774 cells were subjected to pulse-chase analysis (see legend to Fig. 3). p60 bands were quantified from the polyacrylamide gels using a PhosphorImager, and half-lives were determined by plotting percentages of remaining p60 against the chase time intervals.minWild type p6060–90p60 217Ser Full-lengthND1-bNot determinable, because this mutant cannot be distinguished from wild type p60.

Open table in a new tab LLnL, a membrane-permeable inhibitor of proteasomes, inhibits the proteolysis of p60 in infected J774 cells (6Sijts A.J.A.M. Villanueva M.S. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1497-1503PubMed Google Scholar). We found that degradation of each p60 mutant was abrogated by treatment with LLnL (Fig. 3 E and results not shown), suggesting that their degradation is also proteasome-mediated. Since LLnL enhances the metabolic labeling of intracellular L. monocytogenes (36Villanueva M.S. Sijts A.J.A.M. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5227-5233PubMed Google Scholar) and since LLnL-induced effects on cellular proteolysis are rapidly reversible (4Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar), we decided to use this inhibitor to facilitate the detection and analysis of poorly secreted p60 mutants. When J774 cells were pulse-labeled in the presence of LLnL and chased in its absence, wild type p60 was degraded normally (results not shown). Similar analysis of J774 cells infected with L. monocytogenesstrains p60 Δ45–90, p60 Δ91–141, p60Δ170–216, and p60 Δ226–266 revealed that they were rapidly degraded with half-lives of 15–50 min (Table I). In summary, we find that deletions throughout the N-terminal and middle regions of p60 increase the intracellular degradation rate of this antigen, while truncation of the C terminus is modestly stabilizing.

Protozoan parasites cause a variety of devastating and often fatal diseases in humans and their domestic animals. The treatment and control of parasitic diseases, however, is severely compromised by the dearth of effective and selective antiparasitic therapies. Many of the current antiparasitic drugs cause severe toxicity in the host, a predicament that can be attributed to lack of target specificity. Moreover, these drugs are potentially mutagenic and/or carcinogenic, they often require protracted courses with multiple drug administrations, and therapeutic unresponsiveness and drug resistance have exacerbated the necessity for new and improved antiparasitic agents. The institution of a rational therapeutic regimen for the treatment and prevention of parasitic diseases hinges upon exploitation of fundamental biochemical disparities between parasite and host. Perhaps the most striking metabolic discrepancy between parasites and humans is the purine pathway. Whereas mammalian cells can synthesize the purine heterocycle de novo, all protozoan parasites studied thus far are auxotrophic for purines (1Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry of Parasitic Organisms and Its Molecular Foundations. Academic Press Limited, London1995: 89-117Google Scholar). As a consequence, each genus of parasite has evolved a unique complement of purine salvage enzymes that enable the organism to scavenge host purines. Unique features of the purine salvage pathway of Leishmania andTrypanosoma constitute the basis for the susceptibility of these genera to several pyrazolopyrimidine analogs of naturally occurring purine bases and nucleosides (2Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Ullman B. Pharmaceut. Res. 1984; 1: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The intact parasites efficiently metabolize these analogs to the nucleotide level, whereas mammalian cells are essentially incapable of these metabolic transformations. One of these pyrazolopyrimidines, allopurinol (4-hydroxypyrazolo[3,4]pyrimidine, HPP), 1The abbreviations used are: HPP, allopurinol; AK, adenosine kinase; APP, 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine; APRT, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; HGPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; HGXPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; kb, kilobase pair(s); LOH, loss-of-heterozygosity; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PRT, phosphoribosyltransferase; XPRT, xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase.1The abbreviations used are: HPP, allopurinol; AK, adenosine kinase; APP, 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine; APRT, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; HGPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; HGXPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; kb, kilobase pair(s); LOH, loss-of-heterozygosity; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PRT, phosphoribosyltransferase; XPRT, xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase.a drug that is nontoxic to humans and is widely used in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout (4Palella T.D.

Hyg. 1990; 43: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, is a digenetic parasite that exists as an extracellular promastigote within the insect vector, members of the phlebotomine sandfly family, and as a nonmotile intracellular amastigote within the phagolysosome of macrophages and other cells of the reticuloendothelial system of the mammalian host. L. donovani expresses a number of enzymes capable of converting preformed purines directly to nucleotides. These enzymes include hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT; IMP:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase; EC 2.4.2.8), adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT; AMP:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase; EC 2.4.2.7), xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRT; XMP:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase; EC 2.4.2.22), and adenosine kinase (AK).Leishmania also contain a plethora of purine interconversion enzymes including nucleosidases, phosphorylases, deaminases, and IMP branchpoint enzymes (1Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry of Parasitic Organisms and Its Molecular Foundations. Academic Press Limited, London1995: 89-117Google Scholar). Overall, the purine pathway is divagating and intricate, and this metabolic complexity and the apparent overall diploid nature of the parasite (7Cruz A. Beverley S.M.

These strains were created either by replacing each allele sequentially with independent drug resistance markers or by disrupting the first allele with one drug resistance marker and selecting for loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) with drug pressure to obtain the homozygous null mutant. The new alleles in the heterozygotes and homozygotes were examined by Southern blotting, and the resultant phenotypes of the mutant strains have been evaluated for enzymatic activities, ability to take up purines, drug resistance profiles, and growth properties. [14C]Hypoxanthine, [14C]guanine, [14C]adenine, and [14C]xanthine, all at 56 mCi/mmol, and [3H]adenosine at 32.5 Ci/mmol were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-35S]dATP (1320 Ci/mmol) were bought from NEN Life Science Products. All restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were acquired from either New England Biolabs, Inc. or Life Technologies, Inc., and Thermus flavus DNA polymerase was purchased from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). The pX63-NEO and pX63-HYG drug resistance cassettes were furnished by Dr. Stephen Beverley (Harvard Medical School). The sources of all other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. Promastigotes of the Sudanese 1S strain ofL. donovani were grown in DME-L culture medium (18Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, DME-L contains 100 μm xanthine as a purine source. Clonal lines of L. donovani were isolated as colonies on semi-solid DME-L medium containing appropriate selective agent as indicated (18Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J.

TUBA2 and APPA2B3 cells and all of their progeny were continuously maintained in either 1 μm tubercidin, a cytotoxic AK substrate (17Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem.

For the genetic manipulations of the HGPRT and APRT loci described here, DI700, TUBA2, and APPB2A3 cell lines are designated DI700:H+/+A+/+, TUBA2:H+/+A+/+, and APPB2A3:H+/+, respectively, where H refers to HGPRT, A to APRT, and + is the wild type allele (see Table I). No allelic nomenclature is given for the APRT locus of APPB2A3 cells, as the genetic basis for the APRT deficiency in this strain has not been characterized. Sensitivities of wild type and strains created by targeted gene replacement to HPP, 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4]pyrimidine (APP), 4-thiopurinol, and HPP riboside were performed as described (8Iovannisci D.M.

Parasitol. 1995; 74: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were isolated from cosmids as 3.5-kb EcoRI and 5.4-kbBamHI-XbaI restriction fragments, respectively. Flanking regions of the two genes were identified by restriction mapping and Southern blotting. An additional 5.2-kbSalI-EcoRI (21Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) DNA located immediately 5′ to the 3.5-kb EcoRI DNA was also obtained from theHGPRT-containing cosmid to amplify the 5′-flanking region ofHGPRT for construction of gene targeting vectors. The flanking regions from the HGPRT and APRT loci and the oligonucleotides used for their amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been reported previously (21Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The construction and authentication of the pX63-NEO-Δhgprt and pX63-HYG-Δaprt plasmids employed in the allelic replacements of the HGPRT and APRT loci, respectively, have also been described (21Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). pX63-NEO-Δhgprt contains a 1.7-kb 5′ and a 1.8-kb 3′-flanking region from the L. donovani HGPRTencompassing the neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO) gene, while pX-HYG-Δaprt includes a 1.4-kb 5′ and a 1.5-kb 3′ flank of the L. donovani APRT circumscribing the hygromycin phosphotransferase (HYG) marker. To generate aHYG construct for replacing the HGPRT locus, the 1.7-kb 5′ and 1.8-kb 3′ flanks employed for making pX63-NEO-Δhgprt were reamplified using the PCR conditions described by Hwang et al. (21Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and ligated into the appropriate restriction sites within pX63-HYG. The pX63-HYG-Δhgprt construct was verified for identity and orientation by limited restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing. Parasites were transfected using electroporation conditions reported previously (11Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 21Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All targeting constructs were cleaved from their plasmids by digestion withHindIII and BglII just prior to electroporation, isolated on agarose gels, and purified using the GeneClean Kit (Intermountain Scientific Corp., Bountiful, UT). Designation of the targeting DNAs originated from the plasmid nomenclature without the initial letter, e.g. X63-HYG-Δhgprtfrom pX63-HYG-Δhgprt. All transfected cells were grown for 24 h under nonselective conditions prior to the initiation of drug pressure. To generate lines heterozygous at either the HGPRT (hgprt/HGPRT) or APRT(aprt/APRT) locus, L. donovani promastigotes were transfected with the appropriate targeting construct, and heterozygotes were selected by the addition of either 50 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) or hygromycin B to liquid medium or 16 μg/ml G418 or 50 μg/ml hygromycin B to semi-solid medium. Clonal populations were selected on agar plates as described (18Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The genotypes of the heterozygotes were determined by Southern blotting using appropriate protein coding and flanking probes. To generate homozygous null mutants (Δhgprt or Δaprt) from the heterozygotes, two strategies were employed. The first required a second round of transfection with an independent drug resistance cassette, i.e. double targeted gene replacement. Using this approach, both G418 and hygromycin were added to the plates to select for parasites in which the wild type allele in the heterozygous recipient had been specifically disrupted by homologous recombination of the second targeting construct. The second protocol for selecting homozygous null mutants at either theHGPRT or APRT loci was to select for LOH by plating in semi-solid agarose to which a toxic substrate of the encoded gene product had been added. Specific selective conditions were 1–3 mm HPP to obtain Δhgprt clones and 100 μm APP to obtain Δaprt clones. Selections for LOH at the HGPRT and APRT loci included G418 and/or hygromycin, as specified, in the medium to retain drug resistance cassettes that had been previously integrated at the appropriate locus/loci by targeted gene replacement. All L. donovani transformants that had integrated copies of either X63-NEO-Δhgprt, X63-HYG-Δhgprt, or X63-HYG-Δaprt into the relevant loci were maintained continuously under selective pressure in the drugs for which they contained resistance markers. In addition, knockout cell lines created by single targeted gene replacement as described above were also grown perpetually in the agent in which they were selected,i.e. 2 mm HPP or 100 μm APP as appropriate. Exponentially growing L. donovaniwere harvested in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and lysed either by sonication or by three rounds of freeze-thawing.

The rate of [14C]hypoxanthine incorporation into phosphorylated metabolites in the absence or presence of excess nonradiolabeled purines was ascertained at room temperature using a slight modification of the DE-81 filter disk method outlined by Iovannisci et al. (17Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 12: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 108 parasites were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1.0 ml of modified DME-L growth medium lacking the hemin and xanthine components prior to the addition of radiolabel and purine additives. [14C]Hypoxanthine and nonradiolabeled purines were present at 1.8 μm and 100 μm, respectively, in the uptake assays. The assay was terminated by removing 100-μl aliquots of (107) cells, diluting them in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline, and subjecting them to centrifugation. The pelleted cells were washed twice in 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and blotted onto a 1.5-cm2 piece of DE-81 impregnated paper. The disks were washed as described (17Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 12: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A flow chart describing the derivation and lineages of all of the mutant strains that were created as a result of targeted gene replacement and/or direct selection in cytotoxic substrate is depicted in Fig.1. Three parental recipient clonal cell lines were employed for the transfection experiments, DI700 wild type cells, TUBA2 ak− cells, and APPB2A3 aprt− cells. The three parental cell lines are designated DI700:H+/+A+/+, TUBA2:H+/+A+/+, and APPB2A3:H+/ n, respectively (Fig. 1), as theirHGPRT and APRT loci have not been targeted by gene replacement vectors. Heterozygotes (hgprt/HGPRT) in which a single wild type HGPRT allele was disrupted by targeted gene replacement approaches were obtained from DI700 (DI700:H+/ n A+/+) and TUBA2 (TUBA2:H+/ n A+/+) cells with X63-NEO-Δhgprt as the targeting vector and from APPA2A3 (APPB2A3:H+/ h) cells with X63-HYG-Δhgprt. Homozygous null mutants (Δhgprt) were then obtained from the threehgprt/HGPRT lines by two independent strategies, either by targeting with the appropriate construct containing the second drug resistance marker (DI700:H n/h A+/+, TUBA2:H n/h A+/+, and APPB2A3:H h/n) or by direct negative selection (DI700:H n/n A+/+ and TUBA2:H n/n A+/+) for LOH (see Fig. 1). Nomenclature for all the Δhgprt cell lines shown in Fig. 1 conforms to that employed for the heterozygotes. The ability to generate Δhgprt null mutants after only a single round of transfection permitted the creation of L. donovani cell lines in which both wild type alleles of theHGPRT and APRT loci had been displaced, each with a single targeting construct. Cell lines heterozygous at the APRT locus (aprt/APRT) were thus created from the DI700:H n/n A+/+ and TUBA2:H n/n A+/+ cell lines, as well as from the parental TUBA2:H+/+A+/+strain by targeted gene replacement using the X63-HYG-Δaprt construct. These derivatives were designated DI700:H n/n A+/ h, TUBA2:H n/n A+/ h, and TUBA2: H+/+A+/ h, respectively (Fig.1). Δaprt clonal progeny, DI700:H n/n A h/h, TUBA2:H n/n A h/h, and TUBA2:H+/+A h/h, were then selected for LOH from the three aprt/APRT heterozygotes in 100 μm APP (Fig. 1). Southern blot analysis verified the existence of the new alleles that had been created after either double or single targeted gene replacement. The maps of the genomic loci forHGPRT and APRT and the novel alleles created by homologous recombination of X63-NEO-Δhgprt into theHGPRT locus and X63-HYG-Δaprt into theAPRT locus have been reported previously (21Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The X63-HYG-Δhgprt construct and its rearranged allele after insertion into the chromosome are displayed in Fig. 2. The maps of the HGPRT and APRT loci are also included in Fig. 2 to show the location of the probes employed in the Southern blotting experiments. The expected size differences of the wild type and disrupted HGPRT alleles in strains that were generated or employed for these studies can be visualized in Fig.3. The interrupted HGPRT alleles could be distinguished from the wild type allele by an altered EcoRI restriction pattern (Fig. 3). After cleavage of genomic DNA withEcoRI and hybridization to probe B derived from the 3′-flanking region of HGPRT (see Fig. 2), only the anticipated 4.6-kb EcoRI fragment from the wild type allele was discerned in the three parental, i.e, DI700:H+/+A+/+, APPB2A3:H+/+, and TUBA2:H+/+A+/+, strains in which theHGPRT locus was intact (see Fig. 3, probe B). Although the HGPRT was originally isolated as a 3.5-kbEcoRI fragment (see “Experimental Procedures”), the 4.6-kb EcoRI band is the expected size of the wild typeHGPRT allele, as the 3′ EcoRI restriction site of the cloned 3.5-kb fragment originates from the cosmid. In contrast, bands of 6.4 and 6.2 kb were observed in those strains in which anHGPRT allele had been targeted by either X63-NEO-Δhgprt or X63-HYG-Δhgprt, respectively (Fig. 3). Cell lines heterozygous for HGPRT (H+/ h or H+/ h) retained the 4.6-kb EcoRI fragment derived from the wild type locus, while HGPRT null mutants (H n/h or H n/n) lacked the wild type 4.6-kbEcoRI restriction fragment and exhibited only the expected 6.4- and 6.2-kb displacements by X63-NEO-Δhgprt and X63-HYG-Δhgprt, respectively (Fig. 3, probe B). The interruption of the wild type HGPRT allele was verified by hybridization of genomic DNA to probe Acorresponding to the coding region of HGPRT (see Fig. 2). The 4.6-kb EcoRI fragment was detected only in cell lines that were wild type or heterozygous at the HGPRT locus,i.e. the H+/+, H+/ n, and H+/ h strains and not in Δhgprt null mutants that were derived by either double targeted (H n/h) or single targeted (H n/n) gene replacement (Fig. 3, probe A).Figure 3Southern blot analysis of the HGPRTlocus in wild type and mutant strains.

These enigmatic genetic alterations in the anomalous cell lines were not analyzed in detail, and the reasons for the large discrepancies in the frequency by which various genetic events were observed during each round of transfection is unknown. However, genetic events that do not involve simple allelic replacements after homologous recombination of an extrachromosomal fragment have been observed previously in Leishmania spp. (7Cruz A.

Disruption of the wild type APRT locus in lines that were targeted by X63-HYG-Δaprt was also validated by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 4). aprt/APRTheterozygotes and Δaprt homozygous knockouts were only derived from the DI700 and TUBA2 lines (see Fig. 1), as APPB2A3 cells already lacked APRT activity (8Iovannisci D.M. Goebel D. Kaur K. Allen K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of genomic DNA withSalI and BamHI and hybridization to probe D derived from the 5′-flanking region of APRT (Fig. 2) revealed the presence of the 3.5-kb SalI/BamHI restriction fragment from the wild type allele in all A+/+and A+/ h cells (Fig. 4, probe D). Theaprt/APRT heterozygotes contained an additional 1.4-kbSalI band (see Fig. 2) derived from the new allele created by integration of X63-HYG-Δaprt into the APRT locus. Hybridization of DNA from all of the presumptive Δaprtnull mutants to probe D revealed only the 1.4-kb band expected from the integration of the drug resistance cassette into both alleles of the APRT locus (Fig. 4, probe D). Genetic disruption of wild type APRT alleles was confirmed by hybridization of the same blot to probe C encompassing most of the APRT coding region (Fig. 4, probe C).APRT coding sequences existed only in cells containing one or two wild type APRT copies, whereas the knockout lines TUBA2:H+/+A h/h and TU"

Due to the lability of the intermediate, cob(I)alamin, the activity of methionine synthase is additionally dependent on a redox activation system. In bacteria, two flavoproteins, NADPH-flavodoxin reductase and flavodoxin, shuttle electrons from NADPH to methionine synthase. Their mammalian counterparts are unknown, and a putative intrinsic thiol oxidase activity of the mammalian methionine synthase has been proposed to be involved. We demonstrate that the mammalian methionine synthase can be activated in an NADPH-dependent reaction and requires a minimum of two redox proteins. This model is consistent with our results from biochemical complementation studies betweencblG and cblE cell lines and mutation detection analysis in cblG cell lines. These demonstrate that thecblG cell line has defects affecting methionine synthase directly, whereas the cblE cell line has defects in the redox proteins.

We have also identified a P1173L mutation in the activation domain of methionine synthase in the cblG cell line WG1505. Methionine synthase (E.C. 2.1.1.13) is a cobalamin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes two successive transmethylation reactions (1Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 2Banerjee R. Chem. Biol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 4: 175-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In one half-reaction, the methyl group from the substrate CH3-H4folate 1The abbreviations used are: CH3-H4folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; DTT, dithiothreitol; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; OHCbl, hydroxycobalamin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. is transferred to the cob(I)alamin form of the cofactor to generate the intermediate, methylcobalamin (Fig. 1). In the next step, the methyl group is displaced by homocysteine to give methionine and H4folate. Catalysis, however, comes with dangers to the enzyme, since the intermediate, cob(I)alamin, is supernucleophilic and highly reactive and its methylation competes with oxidation. The oxidized enzyme in which the cofactor is in the cob(II)alamin or hydroxycob(III)alamin state is inactive and requires a reductive methylation step for rescue back to the catalytic turnover cycle. Two flavoproteins serve as conduits for the reducing equivalents that are ultimately derived from NADPH in Escherichia coli (3Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6745-6753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An analogous system has so far not been described in mammals. Instead, a thiol oxidase activity associated with crude porcine liver methionine synthase and assumed to be an intrinsic property of the enzyme has been postulated to function in reductive activation (5Matthews R.G. Jencks D.A. Frasca V. Matthews K.D. Cooper B.A. Whitehead V.M. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1986: 697-707Google Scholar). In mammals, intracellular cobalamin is processed via a complex multistep pathway. It involves at least three (lysosomal, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial) and perhaps four (microsomal) cellular compartments and leads to the two cofactor forms, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin, that support enzymatic activity (6Mellman I.S. Youngdahl-Turner P. Huntington F.W. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Kolhouse J.F. Allen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The enzymatic steps involved in this processing pathway remain obscure and have been defined largely by genetic complementation analysis on cell lines from patients with inborn errors of metabolism (8Shevell M.I. Rosenblatt D.S. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 1992; 19: 472-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Of the various genetically distinct classes of patients with defects in cobalamin metabolism, cblG and cblE display isolated functional methionine synthase deficiency (8Shevell M.I. Rosenblatt D.S. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 1992; 19: 472-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.

McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 3111-3128Google Scholar). Both clinically and biochemically, cblG and cblE patients have similar phenotypes, displaying megaloblastic anemia, homocystinuria, and hypomethioninemia, which together are consistent with a block in the biosynthetic pathway unique to methylcobalamin formation. In cblE patients, methionine synthase activity measured in the presence of a high concentration of DTT has been reported to be similar to that in normal fibroblast cell lines (11Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Pottier A. Lue-Shing H. Matiaszuk N. Grauer K. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,12Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast, in cblG patients, methionine synthase activity has been reported to be either markedly reduced (12Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Hall C. Lindenbaum R.H. Arenson E. Begley J. Chu R. Clin. Inves. Med. 1989; 12: 262-269PubMed Google Scholar) or normal in the presence of high AdoMet concentrations (13Hall C. Lindenbaum R.H. Arenson E. Begley J. Chu R. Clin. Inves. Med. 1989; 12: 262-269PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it has been postulated that cblG patients may have mutations in methionine synthase (12Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or in AdoMet metabolism (13Hall C. Lindenbaum R.H. Arenson E. Begley J. Chu R. Clin. Inves. Med. 1989; 12: 262-269PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the cblE patients have defects in one of the two redox proteins that activates methionine synthase (11Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Pottier A. Lue-Shing H. Matiaszuk N. Grauer K. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Some of the variability in the reported results could be attributed to the differing degrees of anaerobicity achieved in the in vitroassays in different laboratories. This is a critical issue since the activity of methionine synthase is oxygen-sensitive. In this study, we report that NADPH can serve as an electron source in the reductive activation of mammalian methionine synthase. Furthermore, fractionation of crude homogenates indicates that at least two redox proteins are required for NADPH-dependent activation of porcine methionine synthase. We have exploited these observations to distinguish between the defective loci in cblG andcblE cell lines that exhibit functional methionine synthase deficiency. Our results demonstrate that cblG andcblE patients have defects in methionine synthase and in the auxiliary redox protein(s), respectively. The following materials were purchased from Sigma: AdoMet, OHCbl, DTT, NADPH. Titanium chloride was purchased from Aldrich, and titanium citrate was prepared as described previously (15Zehnder A.J.B. Wuhrman K. Science. 1976; 194: 1165-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). (6R,6S)-5-[14CH3]-H4folate (barium salt, 55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Life Science, Inc. (6R,6S)-CH3-H4folate (calcium salt) was obtained from Schircks' Laboratories (Switzerland). Cell lines were from patients who have been characterized as belonging to the cblE or to thecblG complementation group. Some of these have been described previously: cblE: WG1146, WG1384, WG788, WG1308 (12Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); cblG: WG1670, WG1655 (16Sillaots S.L. Hall C.A. Hurteloup V. Rosenblatt D.S. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 47: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cell lines were cultured and harvested as described previously in the absence of B12supplementation (11Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Pottier A. Lue-Shing H. Matiaszuk N. Grauer K. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Approximately 108 cells were harvested from each cell line for enzyme activity assays. Methionine synthase from porcine liver was purified to near homogeneity as described previously (17Chen Z. Crippen K. Gulati S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27193-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of this enzyme was 1.7 μmol of methionine formed/min/mg of protein at 37 °C. For fractionation of the redox components, two pig livers were processed through the DEAE batch chromatography step as described previously for the purification of porcine methionine synthase (17Chen Z. Crippen K. Gulati S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27193-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure yielded three fractions eluting at 50 mm, 180 mm, and 400 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Methionine synthase was present in the 400 mm fraction. Cells were disrupted, and the cell-free extracts were prepared as described previously (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Anaerobic assays were performed using either DTT/OHCbl, titanium citrate, or NADPH as the reductant. Assays were performed in 10-ml serum vials in which the atmosphere had been exchanged for a N2:H2 (19:1) mixture by overnight storage in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI). All stock reagent solutions were made anaerobic by bubbling N2through them for at least 30 min and were stored in stoppered serum vials. This procedure was repeated periodically with solutions that were stored for long periods of time. The enzyme (placed in a stoppered serum vial on ice) was made anaerobic by gently passing N2over the solution for 30 min. The NADPH-dependent assay exploits the presence of the endogenous redox proteins in the cell lysate. Briefly, the assay mixture contained the following components: 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 500 μm homocysteine, 152 μm AdoMet, 1 mm NADPH, 250 μm(6R,6S)-5-[14CH3]-H4folate, and enzyme in a final volume of 0.5 ml (for cell extracts) or 1 ml (for porcine liver enzyme). The reaction mixture lacking [14CH3]-H4folate was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated with [14CH3]-H4folate, incubated for 60 min (with cultured cell extracts) or 10 min (with porcine liver extracts) at 37 °C, and terminated by heating at 98 °C for 2 min followed by cooling on ice for 2 min. Radiolabeled methionine was separated from unreacted substrate by chromatography on a Dowex 1 × 8 column as described previously (19Banerjee R. Gulati S. Chen Z. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Chen Z. Chakraborty S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19246-19249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Control assays in which enzyme was omitted were run in parallel and served as blanks. Conditions for the DTT/OHCbl and titanium citrate assays have been described (19Banerjee R. Gulati S. Chen Z. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Chen Z. Chakraborty S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19246-19249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in duplicate. For the complementation studies, either 0.6 or 0.3 mg of individual cell extracts was employed depending on whether the cell lines were being assayed singly or combined. A unit of activity refers to 1 pmol of methionine formed/min at 37 °C unless specified otherwise. This patient has been described previously (13Hall C. Lindenbaum R.H. Arenson E. Begley J. Chu R. Clin. Inves. Med. 1989; 12: 262-269PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation and a polymorphism in the methionine synthase gene in this cell line were detected by single strand conformational polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA. For the single strand conformational polymorphism experiments, primers P1-S and P2-A, previously used to detect the P1173L mutation in the cblG cell line WG1892, were employed (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Anomalously migrating bands were excised from the sequencing gel, amplified by PCR, and subjected to direct nucleotide sequencing as described previously (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The 3′ end of the methionine synthase cDNA from this cell line was amplified by PCR and cloned in the PCR 2.1 TA vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The two alleles were distinguished by MspI digestion (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the allele lacking the P1173L mutation was subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis (DNA sequencing facility, University of Nebraska, Lincoln). Thiols have been implicated as physiological reductants of the mammalian methionine synthase based on the observation that a putative thiol oxidase activity is associated with the crude enzyme (5Matthews R.G. Jencks D.A. Frasca V. Matthews K.D. Cooper B.A. Whitehead V.M. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1986: 697-707Google Scholar). We were unable to observe methionine synthase activity when thiols such as glutathione or cysteamine were employed as the sole reductant under aerobic assay conditions (data not shown). 2The specific thiol oxidase activity present in crude porcine liver is inversely related to the specific activity of methionine synthase (Z. Chen and R. Banerjee, unpublished results). In contrast, NADPH supported the activity of crude, but not of pure, methionine synthase (TableI) under anaerobic conditions. In the crude homogenate, addition of NADPH stimulated activity approximately 3-fold. The activity observed in the absence of exogenous NADPH is presumably due to the presence of endogenous NADPH present in the homogenate. Addition of pure enzyme to the crude homogenate increased the amount of methionine formed as expected.Table INADPH-dependent activity of porcine methionine synthaseAssay FractionsMethionine formed1-aMethionine synthase activity was measured in the anaerobic NADPH assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”pmolCrude homogenate (− NADPH)1,443Homogenate + NADPH4,126Homogenate + NADPH + pure methionine synthase8,032Pure methionine synthase + NADPH701-a Methionine synthase activity was measured in the anaerobic NADPH assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab To determine if the addition of one or more components in the crude homogenate could restore NADPH-dependent activation of pure methionine synthase, DEAE batch chromatography was employed to yield three different fractions of the homogenate. The addition of the 50 and 400 mm potassium Pi fractions was sufficient to sustain NADPH-dependent activity of methionine synthase (Table II). Since reduced pyridine nucleotide oxidases are abundant in liver, the anaerobic assay conditions were critical. Under aerobic conditions, NADPH does not support methionine synthase activity even at concentrations as high as 50 mm.Table IIReconstitution of NADPH-dependent methionine synthase activity from fractions obtained from liver homogenateEluatesMethionine formedmm potassium P ipmol503791803124009850 + 180 + 4001,97050 + 180177180 + 40058050 + 4002,166 Open table in a new tab Methionine synthase activity was measured under rigorously anaerobic assay conditions using three different sources of reductant (see Table III). A subset of cblG cell lines (WG1670 and WG1671) shows reduced activity under all conditions. A second subset ofcblG cell lines (WG1505, WG1308, WG2292) and all thecblE cell lines have methionine synthase activity that is comparable to that of controls when artificial reductants, DTT/OHCbl or titanium citrate, are employed. However, in the presence of NADPH, the activity is approximately 2–30-fold lower in these patient cell lines compared with controls. In the subset of cblG cell lines represented by WG1670 and WG1671, methionine synthase activity was too low to be measured in the NADPH assay, where activity is always lower than in the other two assays. 3A third member of this subclass, cblG cell line WG1655, is described in Table IV. The NADPH assay was conducted on this cell line using the maximum possible volume of cell lysate in the assay. Methionine synthase activity was not detected above background levels. The holoenzyme content of methionine synthase ranges from 40 to 100% in these cell lines, and no correlation is observed between the proportion of holoenzyme and the type of defect. This variability in the proportion of holomethionine synthase in cultured cells contrasts with the enzyme being present in a predominantly holoenzyme form in both porcine liver and human placenta (20Chen Z.

Methionine synthase activity was measured using the NADPH assay in cblG andcblE cell lines individually and with the combined extracts (see Table IV). One of the cblG cell lines used in this study, WG1655, had very low methionine synthase activity under all conditions, and it was virtually undetectable in the NADPH assay. Mixing cell extracts from two cblE cell lines, WG1575 (9 units/mg) and WG1384 (7 units/mg), did not increase the low specific methionine synthase activity observed with individual cell lines. Similarly, methionine synthase activity was not enhanced by mixing extracts from cblG cell lines WG1655 (1 unit/mg) and WG1505 (3 units/mg). However, when cell extracts from a cblE (WG1575) and a cblG (WG1655) cell line were combined, the methionine synthase specific activity increased to 50 units/mg, which is 5.6-fold above that of the cblE cell line alone.Table IVBiochemical complementation between cblG and cblE cell linesCell lineSpecific activitycblE (WG 1575)9 ± 1cbl G (WG 1655)1 ± 1cbl E + cbl E (WG 1575 + WG1384)8.2 ± 1.3cbl G + cbl G (WG 1505 + WG1655)3.4 ± 0.3cbl E + cbl G (WG 1575 + WG1655)50 ± 8Methionine synthase activity was measured in the anaerobic NADPH assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specific activity is defined as pmol of methionine formed/min/mg of protein at 37 °C.

Single strand conformational polymorphism analysis revealed an anomalous banding pattern (data not shown) previously observed in the same region in thecblG cell line WG1892 (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing of the excised and PCR-amplified band from WG1505 and comparing the sequence with control cell line samples indicated the presence of a C3804T transition mutation, resulting in a coding sequence change, P1173L. In addition, a likely polymorphism, A3042G, resulting in a coding sequence change, D919G, was detected in the other allele. This polymorphism has been identified previously and was reported to be present in 8 out of 52 control alleles (21Leclerc D. Campeau E. Goyette P. Adjalla C.E. Christensen B. Ross M. Eydoux P. Rosenblatt D.S. Rozen R. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1867-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The P1173L mutation is not observed in 160 control cell lines, as described previously (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is present in only 1 of the 2 alleles in WG1505, consistent with the polymorphic banding pattern observed by single strand conformational polymorphism in which two of the four bands corresponding to the unaffected allele comigrate with control bands. Restriction digestion of the 359-base pair PCR fragment spanning the C3804T mutation revealed that 2 out of the 5 clones examined contained the mutation, as indicated by the loss of anMspI site (data not shown, but presented previously for WG1892 (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)). Methionine synthase is an oxidation-labile enzyme that can be reductively activated by either DTT/OHCbl or titanium citrate underin vitro assay conditions. In E. coli, two well characterized flavoproteins function to channel reducing equivalents from NADPH to methionine synthase (3Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6745-6753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The components of the mammalian physiological activation system are unknown. Our results with highly purified porcine liver methionine synthase indicate that NADPH can serve as a reductant for this enzyme (Table I). Fractionation of the porcine liver homogenate reveals that a minimum of two components are needed to reconstitute the NADPH-dependent activation system (Table II). Thus, the redox activators are separate from methionine synthase, contrary to the suggestion that the activation system may be integral to it (5Matthews R.G. Jencks D.A. Frasca V. Matthews K.D. Cooper B.A. Whitehead V.M. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1986: 697-707Google Scholar). These results provide the first evidence that a multicomponent NADPH-dependent system activates mammalian methionine synthase under physiological conditions (Fig.2). Homocysteine concentration is increased in 15–40% of patients with coronary, cerebral, or peripheral arterial diseases (22Kang S.S. Wong P.W. Malinow M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), and it is postulated that elevated homocysteine constitutes an independent risk factor for coronary arterial diseases (23Malinow M.R. Clin. Chem. 1994; 41: 173-176Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Green R. Jacobsen D.W. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 75-122Google Scholar). This has provoked an intense interest in identifying genetic loci and associated polymorphisms/mutations that could either directly or indirectly lead to elevated homocysteine levels. The availability of cell lines with catastrophic mutations affecting methionine synthase activity offers a powerful system that we have exploited to better understand the biochemical events leading to hyperhomocysteinemia. Our results can be interpreted in the framework of the model depicted in Fig. 2. This model predicts that the activity of methionine synthase may be compromised (with attendant hyperhomocysteinemia) by defects in the enzyme itself or in one of the two redox-active proteins. We have therefore employed a trilogy of in vitro assays in which the reductant source is varied in order to construct a biochemical system for distinguishing between impairments that specifically compromise reductive activation versus catalysis. As is evident in Table III, all the cblE cell lines and a subclass of cblG cell lines (WG1505, WG1308, and WG2292) are indistinguishable from the control cell lines when the artificial reductants, DTT/OHCbl or titanium citrate, are employed. The activity in these cell lines is higher than previously reported (11Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Pottier A. Lue-Shing H. Matiaszuk N. Grauer K. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,12Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) due to the high degree of anaerobicity achieved in our assays. Under the NADPH-driven assay conditions, marked differences between the patient and control cell lines are observed, ranging from approximately 2-30-fold diminution in activity in the patient group. These results point to the potential diagnostic utility of the NADPH assay for distinguishing cblG and cblE cell lines from controls. The variability of methionine synthase activity in the commonly used DTT/OHCbl assay and the similarity of the observed values to those of control cell lines illustrate the difficulty of distinguishing between control and patient cell lines based solely on this assay. The exception to this is the cblG subclass, in which methionine synthase activity is severely reduced under all assay conditions (WG1670 and WG1671). The enzyme activity in these cell lines is >20-fold lower than in the controls. The difference in the holoenzyme content between the two cell lines derived from siblings, WG1670 (44%) and WG1671 (94%), should be viewed with caution since the measured activity is at the lower end of the linear range for this assay. The biochemical phenotype of cblE and a subset ofcblG cell lines that exhibit normal activity with artificial reductants suggests that their impairments specifically affect reductive activation while sparing the catalytic turnover cycle. Underin vivo conditions, this would lead to an accumulation of methionine synthase in an inactive form. However, these assays do not indicate the location of the mutation, i.e. whether it is in methionine synthase or in one of its redox partners. As discussed above, the second subclass of cblG cell lines (represented by WG1670 and WG1671) denoted as “variants” in the literature (16Sillaots S.L. Hall C.A. Hurteloup V. Rosenblatt D.S. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 47: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), are noted for their low specific activity under all conditions (TableIII). Since cblG cell lines display defects in both the catalytic and activation cycles and belong to a genetic complementation group distinct from cblE, the mutations in this class are likely to be housed in methionine synthase itself (12Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This prediction has recently been confirmed by the identification of mutations in the methionine synthase gene in two cblG cell lines (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Leclerc D. Campeau E. Goyette P. Adjalla C.E. Christensen B. Ross M. Eydoux P. Rosenblatt D.S. Rozen R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3628-3634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In cblG WG1892, two mutations (P1173L and ΔI881) in a compound heterozygous state have been found in the peptide domains involved in activation (summarized in Fig. 2). In a second cell line, cblG WG2290, an H920D mutation in the B12 binding domain has been reported (21Leclerc D. Campeau E. Goyette P. Adjalla C.E. Christensen B. Ross M. Eydoux P. Rosenblatt D.S. Rozen R. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1867-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the presence of the P1173L mutation in an additionalcblG cell line, WG1505. Since the cblG group represents a relatively rare inborn error of metabolism (8Shevell M.I. Rosenblatt D.S. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 1992; 19: 472-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 3111-3128Google Scholar), it is surprising that the P1173L mutation has now been found in two patients who are apparently not related. 4Patients WG1505 and WG1892 are both white; the former is from the United Kingdom, the latter from Colorado. Ethnicity data on these patients are not available. The defect in a cblG cell line (79/96) with a biochemical phenotype similar to that of WG1670, WG1671, and WG1655 has also been reported (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The low specific activity of methionine synthase incblG 79/96 mirrors very low steady-state levels of methionine synthase mRNA (18Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Whereas the precise nature of the defects in these cell lines must await mutation detection analyses, low methionine synthase levels in WG1670 and WG1671 could also explain the low enzyme activity and the virtually undetectable levels of methionine synthase-bound cobalamin in these cell lines as described previously (16Sillaots S.L. Hall C.A. Hurteloup V. Rosenblatt D.S. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 47: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alternatively, mutations leading to a high K m for cobalamin could account for the observed phenotype. Whereas mutation analysis data clearly support methionine synthase as the locus of defects in cblG cell lines, the evidence forcblE cell lines being impaired in the redox proteins has been suggested by biochemical data (11Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Pottier A. Lue-Shing H. Matiaszuk N. Grauer K. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and genetic complementation studies (14Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The somatic cell complementation studies implicate a separate genetic locus. Since the human methionine synthase is a monomeric protein (17Chen Z. Crippen K. Gulati S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27193-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility of intragenic complementation can be ruled out. We have used a biochemical approach complementary to the genetic one to examine if the putative redox protein defect in acblE cell line can be corrected by provision in trans of normal redox proteins from a cblG cell line that harbors defective methionine synthase. As demonstrated in TableIV, the specific activity of methionine synthase in thecblE cell line WG1575 increases 5.6-fold when measured in the presence of cblG WG1655 in the NADPH-dependent assay. The specific activity of methionine synthase under these conditions (50 units/mg) now falls within the range observed for controls (25–100 units/mg, Table III). In contrast, mixing of two cblG or two cblE cell lines does not enhance the specific activity of methionine synthase. These results demonstrate that the defects in cblE cell lines do not directly involve methionine synthase but rather affect the redox protein(s) that support its activity in vivo (11Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Pottier A. Lue-Shing H. Matiaszuk N. Grauer K. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In principle, complementation between two cblE cell lines is possible since a minimum of two redox proteins support the activity of methionine synthase in mammals. We have not examined cblE cell lines other than those reported in Table IV for biochemical complementation (i.e. in the absence of cblG cell lines). However, genetic complementation experiments withcblE cell lines have not indicated intragenic complementation (14Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hence, based on the available biochemical and genetic evidence, it would appear likely that cblE cell lines have mutations in only one of the redox proteins. We suggest that this may be the proximal reducing partner of methionine synthase rather than the distal enzyme that initially accepts electrons from NADPH. Future characterization of the mammalian redox proteins and mutation detection studies in the respective genes will test the hypothesis that the cblE patients have defects in a single enzyme. Biochemical complementation between cblE and cblG cell lines can be exploited either independently or in concert with the somatic complementation approach as a useful diagnostic tool to characterize the nature of the defect in a patient with errors in cobalamin metabolism. In addition, this could be an extremely valuable approach for studying other cell types in which methionine synthase defects are suspected. For instance, some tumor cell lines exhibit methionine dependence in culture (27Ashe H. Clark B.R. Chu F. Hardy D.N. Halpern B.C. Halpern R.M. Smith R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Hoffman R.M. Erbe R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4899-4906PubMed Google Scholar), and in a subset of these, methionine synthase activity is lowered. Since reduced methionine synthase activity can result from a cblG- orcblE-like defect, complementation assays with one (cblG) or both cell types would be a useful first step before mutation detection studies are undertaken. In summary, this study provides the first description of the physiological activation system employed by mammalian methionine synthase. The identities of the individual components await the purification and characterization of these proteins, work that is currently in progress. In addition, we furnish the first unambiguous evidence that cblE cell lines have impairments that are not directly in methionine synthase but in an auxiliary protein that supports methionine synthase activity. This represents an additional locus for genetic defects that can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia.

https://openalex.org/W2122782169,"To evaluate the role of the histamine H2 receptor C terminus in signaling, desensitization, and agonist-induced internalization, canine H2 receptors with truncated C termini were generated. Wild-type (WT) and truncated receptors were tagged at their N termini with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and expressed in COS7 cells. Most of the C-terminal intracellular tail could be truncated (51 of 70 residues, termed T308mutant) without loss of functions: cAMP production, tiotidine binding, and plasma membrane targeting. In fact, the T308 mutant produced more cAMP than the WT when cell-surface expression per cell was equivalent. Pretreatment of cells with 10−5m histamine desensitized cAMP productions via WT and T308 receptors to similar extents. Incubation of cells expressing WT receptors with 10−5m histamine reduced cell-surface anti-HA antibody binding by approximately 30% (by 30 min, t 1/2 ∼ 15 min), but did not affect the B max of tiotidine in membrane fractions, which represents total receptor amounts, suggesting that WT receptors were internalized from the cell surface. In contrast, no internalization was observed with T308 receptors following histamine treatment. A mutant with a deletion of the 30 C-terminal amino acids, termed T329, was functional but was as potent as the WT in terms of cAMP production. Apart from being desensitized by histamine, the internalization of the receptor was indistinguishable from that of the WT. Internalization was observed in the T320 but not in T313 mutant, narrowing the region involved in internalization to that between Glu314 and Asn320 (ETSLRSN). Of these seven residues, either Thr315, Ser316, or both, were replaced with Ala. Thr315 and Ser316 are conserved among species. The mutation at Thr315 (but not that at Ser316) abolished internalization. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Thr315 is involved in agonist-induced internalization. Furthermore, the finding that T308 receptors were desensitized in the absence of internalization suggests that internalization and desensitization are meditated by independent mechanisms.

Recently, a number of studies focusing on GPCRs have examined the role of the C terminus in agonist-induced desensitization and internalization, with varying results.

The present study was designed to analyze the role of this important portion of the histamine H2 receptor in signaling, desensitization, and agonist-induced internalization. To this end, we constructed H2 receptor cDNAs, devoid of either the 71 or the 51 amino acids at the C terminus, and expressed these cDNAs in COS7 cells. Herein, we present evidence that the 51 C-terminal amino acids of the histamine H2 receptor are important for agonist-induced internalization, but not for either signaling or homologous desensitization of cAMP response, which occurs via this receptor. In addition, these amino acids exert inhibitory effects on cAMP production via the H2 receptor. [3H]Tiotidine was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Goat anti-mouse 125I-IgG was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Cimetidine was obtained from Sigma. Anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany). DEAE-dextran was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate. cDNAs for mutant canine H2 receptors with mutations involving C-terminal truncation of 70, 51, 46, 39, 30, and 15 amino acids, respectively, were constructed by polymerase chain reactions. They were termed T289, T308, T313, T320, T329, and T344, respectively. cDNAs for mutant receptors, in which Thr315, Ser316, or both, were replaced with Ala (A315, A316, and A315,316), were also constructed. The HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted into the extracellular N termini of the wild-type (WT) and mutant receptors. After confirming the sequences, the cDNAs encoding the WT histamine H2 receptor and its truncated mutants with or without the HA-tag were subcloned into pCAGGS. COS7 cells were transfected with varying amounts of plasmid DNAs by the DEAE-dextran method. For immunofluorescence microscopy, COS7 cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped off the dish with a rubber blade, and embedded in 10% gelatin/PBS. Semithin frozen sections (1 μm thick) were cut and incubated with anti-HA antibody or antibody against the C terminus of the canine H2 receptor (anti-H2RCT antibody) (2Fukushima Y. Oka Y. Katagiri H.

These sections were then incubated with rhodamine-labeled affinity-purified goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) (13Asano T. Takata K. Katagiri H. Tsukuda K.

At 24 h post-transfection, COS7 cells expressing the WT and truncated H2 receptors with the HA epitope or parental COS7 cells were plated onto 24-well plates at a density of 105 cells/well. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated in Hepes-tyrode's buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4, 5.6 mmglucose, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation in the presence or absence of 10−5m histamine at 37 °C for the indicated times, the cells were fixed with PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde, washed again with PBS, and incubated with 5% skim milk/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. They were incubated with 200 μl of 12CA5 (5 μg/ml) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, washed again with PBS, and incubated for another 1 h with 200 μl of 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution) at room temperature. The wells were then washed twice with 5% skim milk/PBS, twice with PBS, and three times with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS. Bound 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was solubilized in 1% SDS, and radioactivities were determined in a γ-counter. Specific bindings were determined by subtraction of the nonspecific bindings observed in parental COS7 cells. Tiotidine binding assays involving intact cells were performed as described previously (14Fukushima Y. Oka Y. Saitoh T. Katagiri H. Asano T. Matsuhashi N. Takata K. van Breda E. Yazaki Y. Sugano K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). COS7 cells, grown in 24-well plates, were assayed at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of Hepes-Tyrode's buffer containing 1 nm [3H]tiotidine and various concentrations of unlabeled tiotidine (15Gajtkowski G.A. Norris D.B. Rising T.J. Wood T.P. Nature. 1983; 304: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All samples were analyzed in triplicate. After incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, then removed from the wells in 0.1% SDS, and radioactivities were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Tiotidine bindings in membranes were assessed as described previously, with some modifications (2Fukushima Y. Oka Y. Katagiri H. Saitoh T. Asano T. Ishihara H. Matsuhashi N. Kodama T. Yazaki Y. Sugano K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions (200 μg) from COS7 cells were incubated with 1 nm [3H]tiotidine and varying concentrations of unlabeled tiotidine in 25 mm Hepes, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 200 μl at 37 °C for 2 h. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration over Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, followed by 10-ml washes with ice-cold incubation buffer. Radioactivity on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In both experiments, specific bindings were calculated by subtraction of the nonspecific bindings determined in the presence of 10−4m cimetidine. No specific binding was observed in either parental COS7 cells or COS7 cells transfected with the expression vector alone. COS7 cells, plated onto 24-well plates, were assayed at a density of 1 × 105cells/well, as described previously (14Fukushima Y. Oka Y. Saitoh T. Katagiri H. Asano T. Matsuhashi N. Takata K. van Breda E. Yazaki Y. Sugano K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 450 μl of Hepes-Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, after which 50 μl of histamine solution was added to initiate the reaction. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 500 μl of 12% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 × g at 4 °C. Following extraction of the supernatants three times with diethylether, cAMP contents in the samples were measured using a radioimmunoassay (16Homma M. Satoh T. Takezawa J. Ui M. Biochem. Med. 1977; 18: 257-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Histamine-dependent and forskolin-dependent cAMP productions were determined by subtracting basal cAMP productions. To investigate the role of the cytoplasmic tail of the histamine H2 receptor in signaling and desensitization, we generated C terminus-truncated receptor cDNAs. Fig. 1 presents a schematic representation of the 359-amino acid canine histamine H2 receptor. Consensus sites for post-translational modifications,N-glycosylation, and palmitoylation are also indicated (17Gantz I. Schäffer M. DelValle J. Logsdon C. Campbell V. Uhler M. Yamada T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We chose to delete 51 and 70 amino acids from the C-terminal tail, yielding two distinct mutant receptors, termed T308 and T289, lacking 11 and 13 serine/threonine residues, respectively. The T289 receptor was truncated at the beginning of the cytoplasmic C terminus and the T308receptor just distal to the putative palmitoylation site (Cys305). All receptor constructs were tagged at their N termini with a 9-amino acid HA epitope, as shown in Fig. 1. As the HA-epitope is located in the extracellular region, the cell-surface receptor amount can be estimated utilizing the antibody against the HA-epitope, 12CA5. The cDNA constructs were subcloned into an expression vector, pCAGGS and transfected into COS7 cells. COS7 cells do not have detectable endogenous histamine H2 receptors, as demonstrated by the absence of histamine-dependent cAMP production and the absence of specific [3H]tiotidine binding (data not shown), and are thus a suitable model system for these studies. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry using the anti-HA antibody or the anti-H2RCT antibody. Expression of the receptors is shown in Fig. 2. The WT, the HA-wild-type (HA-WT), and the HA-T308 receptors were distributed in the plasma membranes, while the HA-T289 receptor, the 70 C-terminal deleted amino acids of which include Cys305, a consensus site for palmitoylation, was distributed intracellularly as well as in the plasma membranes. Whether the different distribution of the HA-T289 receptor was due to the loss of palmitoylation or to lack of the proximal amino acid residues from 290 to 307 was not determined. In either case, it can be concluded that the 51 C-terminal amino acid residues of the histamine H2 receptor, a large part of the C terminus, are not involved in trafficking of the H2 receptor to the plasma membrane. Similar results were obtained when various amounts of plasmid DNAs were used for transfection of COS7 cells (data not shown), indicating that the different distribution of the receptors is not a function of receptor numbers.Figure 2Immunocytochemistry of the WT and truncated receptors expressed in COS7 cells. COS7 cells were transfected with each plasmid DNA. At 48 h post-transfection COS7 cells were fixed in PBS with 3% paraformaldehyde.

Norris D.B. Rising T.J. Wood T.P. Nature. 1983; 304: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), an H2 receptor antagonist, at 48 h post-transfection. The affinities of the WT and truncated receptors for tiotidine were determined by Scatchard plot analysis. K d values for tiotidine of the WT and T308 receptors were comparable (Table I). In addition, HA-tagging did not affect the affinity of these receptors for tiotidine (Table I). However, irrespective of the HA-tagging, the T289 receptor showed no tiotidine binding. The third and fifth transmembrane regions are reportedly important for ligand binding of the H2 receptor (18Gantz I. DelValle J. Wang L. Tashiro T. Munzert G. Guo Y.-J. Konda Y. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20840-20843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding might be accounted for by a conformational change in the T289 receptor induced by the deletion of amino acid residues from 290 to 307. Since tiotidine is membrane-permeable and is capable of binding to receptors distributed intracellularly, the inability of the T289 mutant to bind to tiotidine is not due to the difference in the intracellular distribution of the receptor shown in Fig. 2.Table IDissociation constants (K d) for tiotidine of wild-type and truncated H2 receptorsK dnmWT23.2 ± 1.1T30825.2 ± 2.7T289No bindingHA-WT25.6 ± 0.8HA-T30822.1 ± 1.5HA-T289No binding Open table in a new tab To examine the role of the C terminus in H2 receptor signaling, we measured histamine-dependent cAMP productions via the WT and truncated receptors in COS7 cells. cAMP productions mediated by these receptors can be compared only when the amounts of cell-surface receptors are equivalent. Iida-Klein et al. (19Iida-Klein A. Guo J. Xie L.Y. Juppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8458-8465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported that in a COS7 transfection system using the DEAE-dextran method the amount of plasmid DNA used for transfection determined the number of cell-surface parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptors expressed per cell but not the percentage of transfected cells. We have obtained similar results, in that the amounts of plasmid DNA affected the number of H2 receptors expressed per cell and the percentage of transfected cells were constant even when the amount of plasmid DNA used was not equivalent (Table II). We transfected various amounts of plasmid DNA for HA-WT, HA-T308, and HA-T289 receptors and measured the number of receptors expressed per cell. As shown in Fig.3 A, the amounts of cell-surface receptors were dependent on the amounts of plasmid DNA used for transfection and, in addition, differed markedly among the WT and mutant receptors even when equivalent amounts (molar) of plasmid DNAs were used for transfection. The number of cell-surface HA-WT receptors expressed was larger than that of HA-T308 receptors when the equivalent amounts of plasmid DNAs were used for transfection. It is essential to study the functions of these receptors at similar expression level. Therefore, we measured histamine-dependent cAMP productions via the WT and mutant receptors at each transfection levels. This allowed comparison of the functions of these receptors. As shown in Fig. 3 B, histamine-dependent cAMP productions were observed in HA-WT and HA-T308 cells but not in HA-T289 cells. Histamine-dependent productions of cAMP observed in HA-WT and HA-T308 were inhibited by cimetidine but not by diphenhydramine (data not shown). Interestingly, as compared with HA-WT receptors, HA-T308 receptors produced more cAMP than the WT receptor (Fig. 3 B) if the numbers of cell-surface receptors per cell were equivalent. Therefore, the 51 C-terminal amino acids are not only essential for, but rather may actually inhibit, cAMP production mediated by the H2 receptor. It is also possible that inhibitory effects on the H2 receptor are exerted via the C-terminal region. Although less marked than those in HA-WT and HA-T308 cells, specific cell-surface anti-HA antibody bindings were also observed in HA-T289 cells (Fig.3 A). Thus, the absence of histamine-dependent cAMP production via T289 receptors was not due to a lack of cell-surface T289 receptors, but rather to the inability of the receptor itself to couple to Gs. It is not clear whether this is due to the absence of the amino acid residues from 289 to 307, or to a conformational change induced by the deletion. Furthermore, the possible contributions of these amino acid residues to cAMP production could not be examined.Table IITransfection efficiency as assessed by immunostaining with the anti-HA antibody[cDNA]HA-WTHA-T308HA-T289μg%%%Exp. 1517.3 ± 2.316.1 ± 2.717.6 ± 2.30.116.1 ± 1.217.2 ± 3.219.2 ± 3.2Exp. 2519.4 ± 2.118.8 ± 4.716.1 ± 2.50.121.1 ± 3.517.7 ± 5.817.9 ± 4.1Exp. 3518.5 ± 3.319.1 ± 3.616.9 ± 3.30.119.3 ± 1.217.7 ± 2.418.1 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab The histamine H2 receptor reportedly shows homologous desensitization of the cAMP response following preincubation with histamine. We examined whether the C-terminal tail of the H2 receptor is involved in desensitization of the cAMP response, which occurs via this receptor. Since COS7 cells expressing the HA-T289mutant did not mediate cAMP production in response to histamine (Fig.3 B), this mutant was omitted from the experiment. COS7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs containing HA-WT (0.4 μg/10-cm plate) or HA-T308 (1.0 μg/10-cm plate) receptors. Transfection with these DNA amounts resulted in similar expression levels of the HA-WT and HA-T308 receptors (Fig.3 A). Preincubation of transfected COS7 cells with 10−5m histamine for 30 min led to reduced cAMP production in both the HA-WT and HA-T308 cells as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4 A), indicating desensitization, while forskolin-dependent cAMP production was slightly increased (Fig. 4 B). It is noteworthy that the transfection efficiency of the COS7 cell system is approximately 20% at best (Table II). Furthermore, the results shown in Fig. 4 B do not necessarily mean that forskolin-dependent cAMP production in COS7 cells expressing the receptors was not altered. Therefore, we performed similar experiments in CHO cells stably expressing HA-WT or HA-T308 receptors and found that histamine-dependent cAMP production via these receptors was reduced by preincubation with 10−5mhistamine, while forskolin-dependent cAMP production was not (data not shown). Similar results were obtained following a 15-min preincubation with 10−5m histamine (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the 51 amino acids of the C terminus of the histamine H2 receptor are not essential for desensitization of the receptor-mediated cAMP response. A number of GPCRs have been reported to be internalized into compartments inaccessible to agonists acting at the plasma membrane. Agonist-induced internalizations of several other GPCRs have been detected by measuring the acid-resistant forms of radiolabeled agonists (7Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol.

However, this experiment cannot be performed for the H2 receptor because of the high levels of nonspecific uptake of histamine by cells. To circumvent this difficulty, we utilized the HA-tag, which is located at the N-terminal extracellular region, to quantify the cell-surface H2 receptor amount. Specific cell-surface bindings of anti-HA antibody were observed in COS7 cells expressing HA-WT and HA-T308 receptors (Fig.3 A), but not in parental or mock transfected COS7 cells (data not shown). We examined the effect of incubation with 10−5m histamine on the cell-surface H2 receptor amount. As shown in Fig. 5 A, in COS7 cells expressing HA-WT receptors the amount of cell-surface anti-HA antibody binding decreased by approximately 30% with a 30-min incubation with 10−5m histamine and thet 1/2 was approximately 15 min. However, neither the binding maximum (B max) of tiotidine in membrane fractions (Fig. 5 B), which represents the total receptor amount, nor the K d for tiotidine (data not shown) was decreased. These findings indicate that HA-WT receptors were internalized from the cell surface. Immunocytochemical examination after a 30-min incubation with histamine revealed the HA-WT receptors to be on the plasma membrane, possibly indicating that the receptors were in coated pits or caveola. In contrast, incubation of COS7 cells expressing HA-T308 receptors with histamine affected neither cell-surface anti-HA antibody binding (Fig. 5 A) nor the B max of tiotidine (Fig. 5 B), indicating that the 51 C-terminal amino acids of the H2 receptor play a role in agonist-induced internalization of the receptor. To define more clearly the region involved in internalization, two mutant receptors, T329 and T344, with deletion of 30 and 15 C-terminal amino acids, respectively, were generated. These mutants were also tagged with the HA-epitope at their N termini and were expressed in COS7 cells. Both receptors were capable of binding tiotidine with affinities similar to that of the WT receptor (data not shown). In contrast to the finding in the HA-T308 mutant receptor, cAMP productions via both receptors were comparable to those mediated by the HA-WT receptor provided that the amounts of cell-surface receptors per cell were equivalent (Fig.6 A). These observations indicate that these 30 amino acids of the C terminus are not involved in inhibition of cAMP production. In addition, cAMP productions via these receptors were desensitized by 10−5m histamine preincubation (data not shown). Finally, upon histamine exposure, HA-T329and HA-T344 receptors showed internalization indistinguishable from that of the HA-WT receptor (Fig.6 B). The results obtained indicate that the region responsible for agonist-induced internalization and inhibition of cAMP production resides between amino acid residues 308 and 328. To identify the amino acid residues involved in agonist-induced internalization, we generated additional mutants, HA-T313 and HA-T320, with deletions of 39 and 46 C-terminal amino acids, respectively. Interestingly, agonist-induced internalization was observed in the HA-T320, but not in the HA-T313 receptor (data not shown). Thus, the amino acid residues involved in agonist-induced internalization of the histamine H2 receptor are likely to reside between Glu314 and Asn320 (ETSLRSN). Of these seven amino acid residues, assuming that the hypothesis that serine and/or threonine phosphorylation is involved in agonist-induced internalization of the H2 receptor is correct, the likely candidates are Thr315and Ser316. This is because these two residues are conserved among species (Table III). To determine whether these amino acid residues are involved in agonist-induced internalization, we generated three mutant receptors, HA-A315, HA-A316, and HA-A315,316, in which either Thr315, Ser316, or both were replaced with Ala. As shown in Fig. 7, the HA-A316 receptor internalization was indistinguishable from that of the WT, whereas those of the HA-A315,316 and HA-A315 were not. This finding clearly demonstrates that Thr315 is involved in agonist-induced internalization of the histamine H2 receptor and that the inabilities of the HA-T308 and HA-T313 mutants to internalize were not due to nonspecific effects induced by the truncations.Table IIIComparison of amino acid sequences of histamine H2 receptor C terminiTruncation at−46(T313) −39(T320) −30(T329)CanineCRPASHNAQETSLRSNSSQLARNQSREPMRQEEKPLKLQVWSGTEVTAPRGATDRRatCKFASHNSHKTSLRLNNSLLPRSQSREGRWQEEKPLKLQVWSGTELTHPQGNPIRHumanCRLANRNSHKTSLRSNASQLSRTQSREPRQQEEKPLKLQVWSGTEVTAPQGATDRGuinea pigCRLASHNSHETSLRLNNSQLNRSQCQEPRWQEDKPLNLQVWSGTEVTAPQGATNR Open table in a new tab The histamine H2 receptor plays a central role in acid production in gastric parietal cells via production of cAMP (24Soll A.H. Wollin A. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 6: E444-E450Google Scholar). Inappropriate gastric acid production can lead to the generation or exacerbation of peptic ulcer disorders. Tight control of signaling via the H2 receptor is thus vital for normal gastric function. It has been accepted that the histamine H2 receptor undergoes rapid desensitization of the cAMP response upon exposure to an agonist (1Prost A. Emani S. Gespach C.

Although homologous desensitization of agonist-induced signaling via GPCRs is an essentially ubiquitous phenomenon, the functional roles of the C termini vary among receptors. In a number of GPCRs, agonist-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of the C terminus has been implicated in receptor desensitization (8Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. De Blasi A. O'Dowd B.F.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7217-7220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while in others the C terminus has been suggested to be involved in agonist-induced internalization, but not in desensitization (20Benya R.V. Fathi Z. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20285-20290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Thomas W.G. Baker K.M. Motel T.J. Thekkumkara T.J. J. Biol.

To understand the as yet unidentified roles of the C terminus in the histamine H2 receptor, we generated two mutant receptors, T289 and T308, which were truncated at the beginning of the cytoplasmic C-terminal portion and just distal to putative palmitoylation site Cys305, respectively. The WT and mutant receptors were tagged at their N termini with the HA epitope and expressed in COS7 cells. One of the primary observations made in our present study was that the T308 receptor with a truncation of 51 amino acids located distal to the putative palmitoylation site was desensitized upon histamine exposure. It is hypothesized that serine/threonine phosphorylation is involved in agonist-induced desensitization of GPCRs. The T308 mutant, which is missing 11 serine/threonine residues present in the C terminus of the histamine H2 receptor, did not show altered agonist-induced uncoupling of the H2 receptor from adenylyl cyclase. Therefore, it is likely that the serine/threonine residues, which may be phosphorylated as part of the desensitization process, reside in other intracellular regions or the proximal C-terminal residues, namely Thr290 and Thr297. Possible contributions of this proximal carboxyl region could not be examined because T289 receptors, which are devoid of all C-terminal amino acid residues, were nonfunctional (Table I, Fig. 3 B). It is noteworthy that the lack of T289 receptor activity is not due to the absence of cell-surface expression but rather to the receptor itself being devoid of functional activity (Fig. 3). Second, the WT receptor was internalized upon histamine exposure while the T308 mutant was not. In addition, the T329mutant with a deletion of 30 amino acids was internalized. Thus, the region involved in internalization of the histamine H2 receptor is present within the area including amino acid residues from 308 to 328. The observation that the T320, but not the T313receptor, was internalized further confined the amino acid residues involved in agonist-induced internalization. Finally, the finding that internalization occurred in the HA-A316 receptor, but in neither the HA-A315 nor the HA-A315,316receptor, identified the amino acid residue involved in agonist-induced internalization of the H2 receptor as Thr315. Our preliminary observations indicated that both the HA-WT and the HA-T308 receptors were phosphorylated after histamine stimulation (data not shown). Thus, although we can speculate that phosphorylation does actually play a part in desensitization, we cannot determine whether it is involved in agonist-induced internalization of the H2 receptor. Recently, Barak et al. (27Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a tyrosine residue highly conserved in G-protein-coupled receptors and in the NPXXY motif is involved in sequestration of the β2-adrenergic receptor. This tyrosine residue is conserved in the histamine H2 receptor (Tyr288) (17Gantz I. Schäffer M. DelValle J. Logsdon C. Campbell V. Uhler M. Yamada T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28Gantz I. Munzert G. Tashiro T. Schäffer M. Wang L. DelValle J. Yamada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1991; 179: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The T308 receptor contains this tyrosine, such that the tyrosine residue Tyr288 appears to be necessary for, but is not by itself sufficient to produce, internalization of the histamine H2 receptor. Furthermore, desensitization of the cAMP response occurring via the T308 receptor, which was not internalized, indicates that internalization per se is not essential for agonist-induced desensitization of the cAMP response and that desensitization and internalization are mediated by independent mechanisms. Third, we have shown the T308 receptor to be more active than the WT receptor in terms of adenylyl cyclase stimulation. In contrast, the T329 and the T344 receptors showed essentially the same levels of activity as the WT receptor. Thus, the 51 C-terminal amino acids of the histamine H2 receptor contain sequences that suppress the interaction of this receptor with G-proteins, and these sequences apparently lie within the region from amino acids 308 to 329. When these sequences are removed a more productive interaction takes place, and hormonal responsiveness upon truncation is enhanced. As desensitization still took place in the T308 receptor, this inhibitory effect is unlikely to be related to desensitization. In conclusion, we have shown in COS7 cells that the C terminus of the histamine H2 receptor is involved in agonist-induced internalization, but not in desensitization. Furthermore, the C terminus is likely to exert an inhibitory effect on cAMP production via the receptor. Since these experiments were performed using fibroblast cell lines transfected with histamine H2 receptor cDNAs, the results presented show that the processes involved in histamine-induced uncoupling of the histamine H2 receptor are not specific to gastric parietal cells. However, the extent of internalization observed in this system is minimal compared with those of other receptors. We cannot rule out the possibility that some other cofactor, which is not present in COS7, might function in histamine H2 receptor internalization. Future studies must be designed to identify the specific amino acid residues involved in agonist-induced desensitization."

Palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine exists as a 9:1 equilibrium mixture of the sn-1 and sn-2 isomers, with the fatty acid predominately at the sn-1 position. We have monitored this reaction by 31P NMR to determine which palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine isomer is processed by cPLA2. When both lysophospholipid isomers are present in a 1:1 mixture under conditions in which acyl migration is minimized, cPLA2 rapidly consumes both isomers. However, 1-palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine is consumed seven times faster than the 2-palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine isomer. We have previously reported that this lysophospholipase reaction is accelerated in the presence of glycerol. We now find that this apparent increase in activity is accounted for, in part, by glycerol acting as an alternative acceptor for the cleaved fatty acid, as is the case for this enzyme's phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. In contrast, dioleoylglycerol, which accelerates the PLA2 activity, does not act as an acceptor in either the lysophospholipase or the PLA2 reaction, but can affect enzyme activities by altering substrate presentation. We also show that a known inhibitor of the PLA2 activity of cPLA2is able to inhibit its lysophospholipase activity with a similar IC50 to its PLA2 activity. However, the effect of inhibitors is dependent on the manner in which they are presented to the enzyme.

The Group IV calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) is an 85-kDa member of this family that displays a preference for phospholipids that contain arachidonic acid (2Clark J.D. Milona N.

Since arachidonic acid is a second messenger for a number of cellular functions and is also a precursor for a variety of proinflammatory eicosanoids (8Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar), cPLA2 has been the subject of a large number of studies directed toward understanding both its mechanism and regulation (see Ref. 9Clark J.D.

However, both the transacylase and esterase activities are a small fraction of the PLA2 activity, while the PLA1 activity is only observed when there is no hydrolyzable acyl chain present at the sn-2 position. In fact, only the lysophospholipase activity is quantitatively significant and comparable with the PLA2 activity. We (10Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and others (7Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13de Carvalho M.G.S.

Biochem. 1993; 218: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have previously shown that the lysophospholipase activity is actually greater than the PLA2 activity under certain conditions. Interestingly, the substrate often used for assaying the lysophospholipase activity is 1-palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine (1-PGPC). Thus, in contrast to the PLA2 activity, the lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2 presumably acts at thesn-1 position, suggesting that cPLA2 is a positionally sloppy enzyme. There are many conflicting views as to the relationship between the two main activities exhibited by cPLA2. It was initially suggested that the two activities may be catalyzed by distinct sites on the enzyme when antibodies were shown to inhibit the PLA2activity, but not the lysophospholipase activity (14Fujimori Y. Kudo I. Fujita K. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A model of separate enzymatic sites would be consistent with the apparently different positions of reactivity on the glycerol backbone of the two phospholipid substrates. However, more recent data by Sharp et al. (15Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23250-23254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the two activities share at least a common catalytic residue. They have shown that a single serine residue is essential for both the PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities. How then can a single catalytic site accommodate a PLA2 activity acting at the sn-2 position of a phospholipid substrate and a lysophospholipase activity acting at thesn-1 position of a lysophospholipid substrate? Actually, lysophospholipids (16Stafford R.E.D. Dennis E.A. Colloids Surf. 1988; 30: 47-64Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) can exist as two positional isomers in which the fatty acid is acylated to either the sn-1 or sn-2 position of a glycerophosphate backbone (Fig. 1). Therefore, the lysophospholipase activity that has been reported to date may merely be a result of the normal PLA2 activity acting exclusively on the 2-palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine isomer. If that were the case, then cPLA2 would not be the positionally sloppy enzyme it had been believed to be. In this report, we try to shed light on the link between the lysophospholipase and PLA2 activities of cPLA2. Most important, we first examine the regiospecificity of the lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2. We have monitored this reaction by 31P NMR to determine which palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine isomer is processed by cPLA2 (17Plückthun A. Dennis E.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1981; 85: 678-683Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We then compare the various modes of activation and inhibition of the two activities. l-α-1-[14C]Palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine andl-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoylglycero-3-phosphocholine were purchased from NEN Life Science Products.l-α-1-Palmitoyl-2-[14C]palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine was purchased from Amersham Corp.

Rhizopus arrhizus lipase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Deuterated solvents were from Cambridge Isotopes. Recombinant cPLA2 was generously provided by Dr. Ruth Kramer (Lilly Research Laboratories). 2-Palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine (2-PGPC) was prepared by treating 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine withRhizopus lipase following published procedures (20Plückthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Conversion of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to 2-PGPC did not proceed to completion. However, palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine could be separated from a mixture with the starting material by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20. 2-PGPC prepared in this manner gave a single spot by analytical TLC, but showed two peaks by 31P NMR corresponding to a 4:1 mixture of palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine isomers (the minor isomer being 1-PGPC). Similarly, commercial 1-PGPC contains ∼10% of the corresponding 2-PGPC isomer. These cross-contaminations have been documented and are attributed to migration of the fatty acyl chain during the preparation and purification of lysophospholipids (20Plückthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Samples were made up in a 35:35:30 (v/v/v) mixture of 200 mm Hepes (pH 7, with 10 mm CaCl2 and 150 mm NaCl), D2O, and glycerol. Appropriate amounts of 1-PGPC and 2-PGPC were combined to give a 1:1 mixture of isomers. Lysophospholipids were stored as chloroform solutions and were thus prepared by first removing the chloroform in vacuo at 25 °C. The resulting film was taken up in 500 μl of the reaction buffer and completely dissolved by vortexing and bath sonication to give a clear and colorless solution (10 mm). Similarly, cPLA2 solutions (4 mg/ml) were diluted in the reaction buffer (typically, 5 μl in 100 μl of buffer). The final concentrations of reagents were 8.3 mmsubstrate and 33 μg/ml enzyme in 600 μl of buffer. Substrate was preincubated at 40 °C in a 5-mm NMR tube, and at zero time, spectra were obtained. Enzyme was then added to this NMR tube to initiate the reaction. In addition, an insert containing 10 mm pyrophosphate in D2O was used as an external standard. 31P NMR spectra were obtained on a General Electric spectrometer operating at 121.5 MHz. A 66° pulse with a 2-s delay and a spectral width of 4000 Hz and 16,000 data points was used. Broad-band proton decoupling was utilized. Spectra were obtained at varying time intervals at 40 °C. Typically, 128 transients were obtained over 8 min. The resulting fid was apodized with a gaussian multiplication with line broadening of 5 Hz. The chemical shifts of the phosphorus-containing compounds are listed in Table I. Chemical shifts are reported relative to 85% phosphoric acid.

Assays were performed in a standard buffer composed of 80 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The mixed micelle assay also contained 1 mm1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoylglycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) (with 100,000 cpm [14C]PAPC), 2 mm Triton X-100, 30% glycerol, and 3.75 μg/ml cPLA2 in a volume of 200 μl. The substrate solution was prepared as described previously (19Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y. Hale M. Wasserman H.H. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Assays were run for 40 min at 40 °C. The reaction was quenched and worked up also as described previously (19Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y. Hale M. Wasserman H.H. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The lysophospholipase activity was measured in a mixed micelle assay that contained 1 mm commercial 1-palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PC) 2Palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine used in the radiochemical assays was a mixture of sn-1 andsn-2 regioisomers and is generally referred to as lyso-PC in the text. (with 100,000 cpm lyso-[14C]PC), 2 mm Triton X-100, 30% glycerol, and 0.5 μg/ml cPLA2 in 200 μl of the standard buffer described above. The substrate was vortexed to clarity instead of probe sonicating. Assays were also run for 40 min at 40 °C and quenched using the modified Dole procedure (21Zhang Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9965-9972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays containing both PAPC and lyso-PC in mixed micelles were composed of 1 mm PAPC, 1 mm lyso-PC (with 100,000 cpm either [14C]PAPC or lyso-[14C]PC), 4 mm Triton X-100, 30% glycerol, and 3.75 μg/ml cPLA2 in 200 μl of the standard buffer. Assays were prepared and run analogous to the PC mixed micelle assay described above. Those assays containing [14C]PAPC were worked up as described for the PLA2 mixed micelle assay, whereas those with lyso-[14C]PC were worked up as described for the lysophospholipase mixed micelle assay. The PC/DAG assay was similar to that described by Kramer et al. (4Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putnam J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but utilized a higher concentration of substrate. This assay contained 20 μm PAPC (with 100,000 cpm [14C]PAPC), 10 μm 1,2-dioleoylglycerol, and 15–25 ng/ml cPLA2 in 200 μl of the standard buffer. The substrate was prepared by adding 3 × assay buffer to the dried PAPC/DAG and probe sonicating. Assays were run for 15 min at 40 °C and extracted using the Dole procedure as described above for the PLA2 mixed micelle assay. Assays that required separation of fatty acid and monoglyceride or triglyceride products utilized the same substrate, buffer components, and assay conditions as described above. The reactions were quenched with 500 μl of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (2:4:1, v/v/v) instead of Dole reagent and then vortexed. To this, 1.0 ml of water and 500 μl of chloroform were added, and the mixture was vortexed again. This solution was then centrifuged (1000 ×g for 2 min) to separate the organic and aqueous layers. 500 μl of the organic layer was transferred to another test tube, and the solvent was evaporated in a vacuum oven overnight at 40 °C. The resulting lipid film was resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and loaded onto TLC prep plates. Unlabeled fatty acid, monoglyceride, and/or triglyceride standards were added to the prep plate. The TLC plate was then developed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v). The resulting TLC plate was visualized with iodine, and zones corresponding to fatty acid, starting phospholipid, monoglyceride, and/or triglyceride were scraped and counted. Blanks were conducted for every data point and substracted from the corresponding data point. Under the experimental conditions described, 1-PGPC, 2-PGPC, and GPC displayed distinct 31P NMR signals (Table I). This permitted simultaneousin situ monitoring of the three species by 31P NMR. Fig. 2 shows the effect of cPLA2 on an equimolar mixture of the two lysophospholipid isomers. In the presence of cPLA2, both palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine isomers were rapidly consumed (<20% of the total starting palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine remained after 2 h). In addition, the consumption of palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine coincided with the expected appearance of GPC (Fig.3 A). In the absence of cPLA2, no GPC formation was observed even after 24 h.Figure 3Time course for the concomitant formation of glycero-3-phosphocholine during cPLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of the two regioisomers of palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine.

Theline represents a best fit to the data using the equation described under “Results”: v =k 1[1-PGPC] +k 2[2-PGPC].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The time courses for the disappearance of both palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine isomers can be fit to first-order rates of decay. The hydrolysis of 1-PGPC displays an apparent first-order rate constant of 0.087 ± 0.008 min−1, whereas the hydrolysis of 2-PGPC has an apparent first-order rate constant of 0.013 ± 0.001 min−1. Thus, in the presence of cPLA2, 1-PGPC is consumed seven times faster than its 2-PGPC isomer. By comparison, the formation of GPC is not a simple first-order exponential process. Instead, it appears to be composed of a combination of two first-order processes (Fig. 3 B). There is an initial fast formation of GPC, followed by a slower rate of GPC production. This result is consistent with a picture of GPC being produced via two non-equivalent simultaneous first-order reactions (22Brown H.C. Fletcher R.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949; 71: 1845-1854Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In other words, cPLA2 is catalyzing the hydrolysis of both 1-PGPC and 2-PGPC directly to GPC. Thus, the rate of GPC production can be described by v =k 1[1-PGPC] +k 2[2-PGPC]. A best fit of the data for GPC formation to this equation yields a k 1 of 0.079 ± 0.009 min−1 and a k 2of 0.015 ± 0.001 min−1 (Fig. 3 B), both of which compare favorably with the experimentally determined apparent rate constants for 1-PGPC and 2-PGPC disappearance. The initial phase of GPC production is the result of both 1-PGPC and 2-PGPC being converted to product. A slower rate of GPC formation results when all the 1-PGPC is consumed, and the formation of GPC can occur only from hydrolysis of 2-PGPC. cPLA2 catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine to glycerol in addition to water. Fig. 4 A shows that when 30% glycerol by volume is present in an assay, both palmitoylglycerol and palmitic acid are generated from cPLA2 activity. Thus, in the presence of glycerol, the total observed lysophospholipase activity in an assay can be accounted for by the combined rates of formation of both palmitoylglycerol and palmitic acid when monoglyceride and fatty acid products are not separated by TLC. The partitioning of the palmitoyl group from palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine to glycerol increases with increasing concentration of glycerol in the presence of cPLA2. Fig.4 B shows that monoglyceride formation increases linearly when the amount of glycerol in the assay is increased from 0 to 30% (v/v). The amount of monoglyceride produced corresponds to an increase of ∼1 μmol/mg for every 1% of glycerol (v/v). DAG does not accept the acyl group from a diacyl or lysophospholipid in the presence of cPLA2. In the presence of cPLA2 under a variety of conditions, no transfer of a palmityl group from palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine to DAG, by separating possible labeled triglyceride from palmitic acid on TLC, was detected. Similarly, no transfer of an arachidonyl group from PAPC to DAG was detected in the presence of cPLA2. Hence, unlike lysophospholipid (10Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or glycerol (11Hanel A.M. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7807-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), DAG is not able accept the fatty acid from a diacyl or lysophospholipid substrate in the presence of cPLA2. This result is not surprising considering that in a mixed micelle assay, DAG does not even activate the activities of cPLA2as glycerol does. In fact, Fig. 5 shows that DAG actually inhibits the PLA2 activity of cPLA2 at high concentration. Interestingly, DAG has no effect on its lysophospholipase activity even at 10 mol % of total lipid. These experiments with DAG were carried out with mixed micelles of Triton X-100 containing both lyso-PC and PAPC substrates. In contrast, DAG does activate both the PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities when Triton X-100 is not present (data not shown). The ability of activated ketones to inhibit the lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2 was evaluated. Fig. 6 A shows the effect of AA-TFMK, PA-TC, and anandamide on the lysophospholipase activity. The activity of the cPLA2 control in this assay was 1.5 μmol/min/mg, higher than the activity observed in a corresponding PLA2 assay (0.2–0.7 μmol/min/mg) (19Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y. Hale M. Wasserman H.H. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This higher activity using a lyso-PC substrate has been noted previously (10Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this assay, AA-TFMK inhibited the lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2 with an IC50 of 70 μm(0.023 mol fraction). PA-TC and anandamide did not inhibit the enzyme. This is in contrast to an assay of the enzyme's PLA2activity with a PAPC substrate, where AA-TFMK (19Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y. Hale M. Wasserman H.H. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), PA-TC (19Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y. Hale M. Wasserman H.H. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and anandamide 3L. J. Reynolds and E. A. Dennis, unpublished data. all appeared to inhibit the enzyme. Instead, in this assay, both PA-TC and anandamide caused an increase in the lysophospholipase activity. To clarify the observed differences in inhibition by these compounds of the PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities of cPLA2, activity was also examined under a different PLA2 assay condition. In the PC/DAG assay, AA-TFMK inhibited enzyme activity with an IC50 of 0.65 μm (0.021 mol fraction) (Fig. 6 B), whereas the presence of PA-TC and anandamide had no effect in this assay. In a final experiment, we assayed both activities under identical assay conditions. We ensured that the PAPC and lyso-PC substrates were presented in a similar form by preparing Triton X-100 mixed micelles containing a 1:1 mixture of both PAPC and lyso-PC substrates. In parallel experiments, we then observed both enzyme activities (Fig.7). In this dual-substrate assay, AA-TFMK again inhibited cPLA2, whereas PA-TC showed slightly weaker inhibition. More significantly, under these conditions, inhibition of the PLA2 activity closely paralleled inhibition of the lysophospholipase activity. It is also interesting that, unlike the single-substrate experiments, under these conditions, the PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities have similar specific activities. Most important, the surface IC50 (in mole fractions) of AA-TFMK is similar under all of the different experimental conditions (Table II), as would be expected for a true active site-directed inhibitor (19Conde-Frieboes K.

Soc. 1996; 118: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Table IIComparison of the inhibition of cPLA2 by AA-TFMK under different assay conditionsAssayIC50μmχsPC mixed micelles640.021Lysophospholipid micelles700.023PC/DAG0.650.021PC/lysophospholipid mixed micelles PLA2 activity1500.024 Lysophospholipase activity1600.026IC50 is expressed in bulk concentration units (μm) and surface mole fractions (χs) Open table in a new tab IC50 is expressed in bulk concentration units (μm) and surface mole fractions (χs) There are a number of characteristic features of the PLA2 activity of cPLA2. Among them is an ability to use glycerol as an acceptor of the cleaved fatty acid to generate monoglyceride (11Hanel A.M. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7807-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The presence of glycerol also appears to yield an increase in the measured PLA2 activity. DAG has been reported to also cause an increase in the PLA2activity (4Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putnam J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activated ketones have been shown to inhibit that activity (19Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y. Hale M. Wasserman H.H. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is much less known about the lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2, and what little is known does not appear to be consistent with the mutagenesis data suggesting a common active site for the two activities. For instance, although the PLA2 activity is known to prefer arachidonic acid- over palmitic acid-containing substrates (23Diez E. Louis-Flamberg P. Hall R.H. Mayer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18342-18348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of lysophospholipase activity has been shown to proceed at similar or greater rates on a palmitic acid-containing substrate than the rate of PLA2activity on arachidonic acid-containing substrates (10Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The regiospecificity of the lysophospholipase reaction and the effect of PLA2 activators and inhibitors on the lysophospholipase activity are addressed below. cPLA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of fatty acid from the sn-2 position of diacylphospholipids to yield a 1-acylglycero-3-phospholipid. In facilitating this reaction, cPLA2 is highly specific for the sn-2 position of diacylphospholipid substrates. It has been reported that no fatty acid is released from the sn-1 position of diacylphospholipids (11Hanel A.M. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7807-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Only when the sn-2 ester was replaced with an unhydrolyzable ether linkage was cPLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of the remaining sn-1 ester bond detected. However, it was not known from which position cPLA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of fatty acids from lysophospholipids. Lysophospholipids can exist as two positional isomers in which the fatty acid is acylated to either the sn-1 or sn-2 position (Fig. 1). In addition, the fatty acyl chain is readily able to migrate between the two hydroxyl groups of the glycerol backbone. At equilibrium, palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine exists as a 9:1 mixture of the two isomers, with the palmitic acid predominately at thesn-1 position (20Plückthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of the lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2 typically utilize commercially available 9:1 equilibrium mixtures of palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine, and the reaction is generally only followed to a few percent conversion by measuring the formation of palmitic acid (7Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13de Carvalho M.G.S. Garritano J. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20439-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Hence, these experiments have not addressed the regiospecificity of the lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2. Indeed, the lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2 could have been due exclusively to the processing of the minor 2-palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine isomer by cPLA2, as might be expected for an analogue of its normal diacyl substrate. We have found that cPLA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1-palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine seven times faster than itssn-2 isomer. Thus, the specificity of cPLA2 for the sn-2 position of a diacylphospholipid substrate switches to a preference for the sn-1 position when the substrate is a lysophospholipid. The lysophospholipase sn-2 activity that is observed may in fact be a consequence of 2-PGPC acting as a poor analogue of a diacylphospholipid substrate for the phospholipase A2 activity of cPLA2. Acyl migration can occur between the two positions of a lysophospholipid and could complicate or obscure our results. However, at pH 7 in the absence of the enzyme, the half-life for migration of palmitic acid between the two hydroxyl groups of GPC is 20 h (20Plückthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This is too slow to account for the observed rate of disappearance of 1-PGPC in our experiments; nor is cPLA2 likely to be catalyzing the isomerization of 1-PGPC to 2-PGPC because the observed consumption of 1-PGPC would then have to proceed through a 2-PGPC intermediate, and then the observed rate of 1-PGPC disappearance could never exceed the rate of 2-PGPC disappearance. (At best, the observed rates of disappearance of 1-PGPC and 2-PGPC would be equivalent in the situation that the hydrolysis reaction is rate-determining.) We find the cPLA2-catalyzed rate of 1-PGPC disappearance to be 7-fold greater than the rate of 2-PGPC disappearance. The above scenario would assume that the isomerization and hydrolysis reactions occur sequentially on the enzyme. In the case that the isomerization and hydrolysis are independent events on the enzyme and intermediate 2-PGPC is released, then the faster rate of 1-PGPC disappearance we observed should result in an initial build-up in the amount of 2-PGPC and an apparent slower initial rate of 2-PGPC disappearance. (If the isomerization step is slower, then the rate of 1-PGPC disappearance would remain constant, but the rate of 2-PGPC disappearance would initially appear fast as the existing 2-PGPC is depleted and would eventually slow to that of 1-PGPC disappearance because it is rate-determining.) In fact, the experimentally measured rates of disappearance of both isomers proceed at constant, but different rates. Thus, acyl migration does not appear to be occurring under our experimental conditions and cannot account for the results we observed. The simplest explanation for the difference in positional specificity between the PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities of cPLA2 is that there are separate catalytic sites responsible for the two activities. However, there is considerable evidence that both activities share a common catalytic serine residue. The mechanism of cPLA2 action has been studied by a number of groups, and there are now several pieces of evidence that implicate the involvement of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Transfer of the fatty acid from both diacyl- and lysophospholipid substrates to acceptors other than water initially suggested the existence of such an acyl-enzyme intermediate (10Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Hanel A.M. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7807-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further corroboration came when NMR studies indicated the formation of a hemiketal between arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (a potent inhibitor of both activities) and an enzyme hydroxyl group (24Trimble L.A. Street I.P. Perrier H. Tremblay N.M. Weech P.K. Bernstein M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12560-12565Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Finally, a serine residue (Ser-228) was identified to be essential for the PLA2 activity and was also shown to be the site of enzyme acylation (15Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23250-23254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Huang Z. Payette P. Abdullah K. Cromlish W.A. Kennedy B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3712-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This serine residue is required not only for the PLA2 activity, but also for the lysophospholipase activity. The involvement of serine 228 in both activities of cPLA2 argues against the likelihood of separate catalytic sites for its two activities. An alternative explanation that accounts for the observed differences in positional specificity of the two activities of cPLA2and the common serine required for both activities is that there are different binding pockets on the enzyme for the two substrates that orient positionally different acyl chains toward the shared catalytic serine. This scenario might explain the anomalous report of an antibody to cPLA2 that inhibits the PLA2 activity and not the lysophospholipase activity (14Fujimori Y. Kudo I. Fujita K. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The antibody would have to be only blocking a region of the enzyme responsible for binding of diacylphospholipids and leaving free a lysophospholipid-binding site and the catalytic serine. Based on our earlier studies (26Ulevitch R.J. Watanabe Y. Sano M. Lister M.D. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3079-3085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a membrane-bound PLA2, in which glycerol was shown to increase its activity, glycerol was also added to cPLA2 assays at up to 70% by volume to improve the activity that was measured (2Clark J.D. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7708-7712Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that glycerol is also able to act as a nucleophile and to accept the fatty acid from a diacylphospholipid substrate (11Hanel A.M. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7807-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In typical radiochemical assays during the isolation of the radiolabeled fatty acid product, the monoglyceride product from the acylation of glycerol also elutes with the free fatty acid formed through the normal hydrolysis pathway, and the two species are counted together. This results in an apparent hydrolysis activity that is greater than what would be measured if the monoglyceride and fatty acid products are separated. Thus, the apparent activity is actually a combination of the formation of the two products as well as an activation of the hydrolysis reaction with water itself. In contrast, with DAG, we have found no evidence for a second product and no activation in a mixed micelle assay. We have previously shown that activated ketones can inhibit the PLA2 activity of cPLA2 (19Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y. Hale M. Wasserman H.H. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When we examined these same inhibitors in an assay of the lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2, we found that they were behaving quite differently. AA-TFMK inhibits the lysophospholipase activity, but PA-TC and anandamide do not. This suggests that these inhibitors are differentiating between the two cPLA2 activities. Furthermore, testing these same inhibitors against the PLA2activity in the DAG assay yielded the same unexpected results. The inhibitors only showed similar effects against both the PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities when examined under identical conditions in which both PAPC and lyso-PC substrates were diluted into Triton X-100 mixed micelles. More important, under these conditions, the PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities decreased in parallel in response to the inhibitors. Thus, some facet of the substrate presentation in the different assay conditions appears to affect the ability of the different compounds to inhibit cPLA2 rather than inherent differences between the two activities. More important, AA-TFMK inhibits both the PLA2and lysophospholipase activities with the same surface IC50(in mole fractions) in all of the assays examined."
https://openalex.org/W2020961473,"We have shown that the complexes between SecB, a chaperone from Escherichia coli, and two physiological ligands, galactose-binding protein and maltose-binding protein, are in rapid, dynamic equilibrium between the bound and free states. Binding to SecB is readily reversible, and each time the ligand is released it undergoes a kinetic partitioning between folding to its native state and re-binding to SecB. Binding requires that the polypeptide be devoid of tertiary structure; once the protein has folded, it is no longer a ligand. Conditions were established in which folding of the polypeptides was sufficiently slow so that at each cycle of dissociation rebinding was favored over folding and a kinetically stable complex between SecB and each polypeptide ligand was observed. Evidence that the ligand is continually released to the bulk solution and rebound was obtained by altering the conditions to increase the rate of folding of each ligand so that folding of the ligand was faster than reassociation with SecB thereby allowing the system to partition to free SecB and folded polypeptide ligand. We conclude that complexes between the chaperone SecB and ligands are in dynamic, rapid equilibrium with the free states. This mode of binding is simpler than that documented for chaperones that function to facilitate folding such as the Hsp70s and Hsp60s, where hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to the binding and release of ligands. This difference may reflect the fact that SecB does not mediate folding but is specialized to facilitate protein export. Without a requirement for exogenous energy it efficiently performs its sole duty: to keep proteins in a nonnative conformation and thus competent for export.

Without a requirement for exogenous energy it efficiently performs its sole duty: to keep proteins in a nonnative conformation and thus competent for export. SecB is a cytosolic chaperone from Escherichia colithat binds a subset of polypeptides destined to be exported to the periplasmic space or to the outer membrane. SecB keeps these proteins in a nonnative conformation, which is competent for export, while delivering them to SecA, the next component in the export pathway. There is no specific sequence of amino acids that distinguishes a polypeptide as a ligand for SecB. The only requirement for binding is that the ligand be devoid of tertiary structure. The binding frames for three physiological ligands, maltose-binding protein, galactose-binding protein, and the oligopeptide-binding protein, have been determined (1Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,2Khisty V.J. Munske G.R. Randall L.L. J. Biol.

In all three cases it was shown that the sequence in contact with SecB is large, minimally comprising 150 amino acids in a continuous stretch. There is no similarity in sequence among the binding frames nor is it obvious that a structural element provides recognition. The large area of contact between SecB and its ligands allows for interaction at multiple subsites with each site having low affinity yet together giving tight binding; the dissociation constant for ligands of SecB is in the range of 10−8m (3Hardy S.J.S.

Sci. 1995; 20: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Even though the affinity is high there are several studies that indicate that the complex of SecB and its ligand is in rapid equilibrium with the unbound forms (3Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L.

These previous studies depended on the presence of a competing species and limiting SecB or on the addition of excess SecB to show that binding is readily reversible. Thus one could not rule out the possibility that binding of competitors at subsites might in a stepwise fashion displace the ligand or that transfer between SecB tetramers might occur directly without release of the ligand to the free state. Here we show directly by changing only the folding rate of the ligand that the complex of SecB and two physiological ligands, galactose-binding protein and maltose-binding protein, is readily reversible even in the absence of competing ligands. Under conditions in which nonnative ligands fold slowly, a kinetically stable complex is observed. Free ligand, present in low abundance, is not readily detectable. By changing conditions such that only the folding rate of the ligands is increased, we obtained evidence for the existence of unbound ligand through the observation of an accumulation of folded, free ligand.

Precursor galactose-binding protein was purified from a strain of E. coli, MM52, which carries a temperature-sensitive allele ofsecA (11Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and harbors plasmid pSF5 (12Luck L.A. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4248-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which contains the gene for galactose-binding protein under its natural promoter. A pre-culture was grown at 30 °C in tryptone broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% glucose to repress expression of galactose-binding protein. These cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was suspended in 3 times the original volume of tryptone broth held at 42 °C, containing 1 mm fucose to induce expression of galactose-binding protein. The culture was grown for 2 h at 42 °C to express the defect in SecA and thereby cause the accumulation of precursor galactose-binding protein. The cells were harvested, washed once with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.3m NaCl, and the cell pellet was frozen at −70 °C. The frozen pellet was thawed and suspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme at a density of 3 × 1010 cells/ml. The cell suspension was sonicated to lyse the cells and break the DNA and then centrifuged for 20 min at 27,000 × g. The pellet that contained membrane and precursor galactose-binding protein in inclusion bodies was suspended at an equivalent cell density of 3 × 1010 cells/ml in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 3% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA to solubilize the membrane proteins. After centrifugation for 20 min at 27,000 × g, the pelletted inclusion bodies were solubilized in a minimal volume (approximately 3 × 1011 cell equivalents/ml) of 6 murea, 25 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.1, for chromatofocusing. Chromatofocusing was performed using a Pharmacia MonoP HR5/20 column, and the gradient was formed with Polybuffer 74 diluted 1/10 in 6m urea and adjusted to pH 6.6 with HCl. Multiple runs were necessary to avoid exceeding the capacity of the column. Fractions containing the precursor galactose-binding protein as detected by SDS-gel electrophoresis were pooled and dialyzed against 1m GdmHCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. Concentration was achieved by multiple rounds of reducing the volume to 1/6 in a SpeedVac (Savant) and dialyzing against 1 mGdmHCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. The final dialysis was against 1 m GdmHCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm potassium acetate, and the concentrated, denatured protein was stored at −70 °C in this solution.

Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10606-10613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In neither case are there tryptophan residues in the leader sequence. The fluorescence intensity was measured using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm (slit width 5 nm) and an emission wavelength of 344 nm (slit width 2 nm) on a Shimadzu RF-540 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 5 °C. Refolding was initiated by manually adding 0.8 nmol of galactose-binding protein unfolded in 1.0 m GdmHCl or 0.14 nmol of maltose-binding protein unfolded in 1.5 m GdmHCl to a chilled, stirred solution containing a chosen concentration of guanidinium chloride, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm potassium acetate, and either 0.5 mm EGTA or 1.5 mmCaCl2. The fluorescence intensity was monitored with time, and the relaxation time to reach equilibrium was calculated. That galactose-binding protein was refolded to the native state was confirmed by comparison of the emission spectra before and after the addition of either galactose or glucose. Binding of galactose causes a blue shift (343–340 nm) and an increase in the fluorescence intensity; glucose binding causes only an increase in the fluorescence intensity. For refolding of all of the proteins studied greater than 80% of the expected fluorescence intensity change was accounted for. For each refolding reaction the GdmHCl concentration was accurately determined by measuring the index of refraction. The relaxation times reported for the refolding of precursor galactose-binding protein and mature galactose-binding protein in the presence of calcium are a weighted average of a slow folding rate (representing 60% of the total change in fluorescence for precursor galactose-binding protein and 50% for mature galactose-binding protein) and a fast folding rate. Relaxation times for refolding of both species of galactose-binding protein were measured at several GdmHCl concentrations and showed a direct dependence on the concentration of the denaturant. A complex between SecB and galactose-binding protein was formed by diluting unfolded galactose-binding protein to a solution held on ice containing SecB to give final concentrations of 0.09m GdmHCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5.5 μm SecB tetramer, and 3.7 μmgalactose-binding protein. The sample was divided into two portions, and one part was analyzed by HPLC size exclusion chromatography using a TSKgel 3000.SW column (TosoHaas) equilibrated in 10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm potassium acetate, and 0.5 mm EGTA at 5 °C. To the second portion, CaCl2 was added to give 6 mm and the mixture analyzed on the TSKgel 3000.SW size exclusion column equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm potassium acetate, and 1.5 mm CaCl2. Complexes between SecB and maltose-binding protein were formed exactly as for galactose-binding protein above. In all cases, the A 280 was monitored, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Carrier protein (∼1 μg) was added to each fraction to facilitate precipitation of the proteins of interest. The fractions were treated with 8% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed with acetone, and suspended in sample buffer for 14% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One quarter of the protein in each fraction and the equivalent of 1/20 of the sample applied to the column were loaded on the gel unless indicated otherwise. Our working model describing the role of SecB in facilitating protein export involves a kinetic partitioning of nonnative precursor proteins between folding to the native conformation in the wrong compartment, the cytosol, and binding to SecB which in turn leads to entry into the export pathway. In this model the ligand is in dynamic, rapid equilibrium between the free and bound states, and thus the proportion of the polypeptides that are properly localized is a function of the rate constant of association relative to the rate constant of folding. To demonstrate that the ligand is constantly sampling the free state thereby allowing a kinetic partitioning to occur, we have made use of two ligands for which we can easily manipulate the rate of folding within the range that is crucial to poise the partitioning to favor either complex formation or folding. Both ligands are sugar binding-proteins, which are exported in E. coli to the aqueous periplasmic space between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes. The periplasmic binding proteins are monomeric comprising two α/β domains with the ligand binding site between the domains. The native structure of the galactose-binding protein contains one Ca2+ ion which stabilizes the structure (17Vytas N.K. Vytas M.N. Quiocho F.A. Nature. 1987; 327: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Maltose-binding protein has a similar tertiary fold but contains no metal ions (18Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reversible folding of both maltose-binding protein and of galactose-binding protein was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. The refolding of both proteins, unfolded by incubation with guanidinium chloride, results in a progressive increase in amplitude of the fluorescence signal that is attributed to the sequestering of tryptophanyl side chains in the interior of the native proteins. The relaxation time to reach equilibrium in a refolding reaction carried out at 5 °C in which mature galactose-binding protein was rapidly subjected to dilution of the denaturant from 1.0 to 0.09 nwas 115 s in the presence of Ca2+, whereas the relaxation time increased to 6300 s in the presence of EGTA (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The refolding of precursor galactose-binding protein was also very sensitive to the presence of calcium. In the presence of calcium precursor galactose-binding protein folded with a relaxation time of 200 s (5 °C, final concentration of guanidinium chloride, 0.09 m). However, in the absence of calcium refolding of precursor galactose-binding protein was so slow it was not measurable. Attempts to measure the folding rate at 25 °C were also fruitless. The presence of the leader peptide and the absence of Ca2+ apparently have a synergistic effect on the refolding reaction. Even though the precursor galactose-binding protein did not refold, it was not irreversibly aggregated since addition of 6 mm CaCl2 to the cuvette containing the precursor galactose-binding protein and EGTA caused a rapid increase in fluorescence to the expected amplitude. Furthermore, the unfolded precursor galactose-binding protein in solutions containing EGTA eluted as a single, symmetrical peak with the expected amplitude when analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig.2 A, dotted line). Maltose-binding protein does not contain bound calcium in its native structure, and as expected calcium had no effect on the rate of folding when the refolding of maltose-binding protein was investigated in a similar series of experiments (data not shown). A complex between SecB and either mature galactose-binding protein or precursor galactose-binding protein can be formed in the absence of calcium since both species fold very slowly under these conditions. These complexes were demonstrated by co-elution of SecB and mature or precursor galactose-binding protein on a size exclusion column (Figs.1 A and2 A, dashed lines, Figs.1 B and 2 B). The complex eluted before free SecB or either refolded or unfolded galactose-binding protein (Figs.1 A and 2 A, dotted lines). Since galactose-binding protein folds so slowly in the absence of calcium, each time it dissociated from SecB it remained a ligand and rebound, thus we observed a complex. If calcium was added to the pre-formed complexes comprising SecB and either mature or precursor galactose-binding protein and then the samples were analyzed on the size exclusion column, a complex was not observed: SecB and galactose-binding protein eluted independently (Figs. 1 A and 2 A, solid lines, Figs.1 C and 2 C). Since the calcium increases the rate of folding of galactose-binding protein, it also increases the probability that when galactose-binding protein is released from SecB it will fold before it rebinds. Furthermore, the complex remained readily reversible even 25 h after formation; a complex was held on ice 25 h in EGTA and following addition of calcium analysis by size exclusion HPLC showed no complex present, whereas without the addition of calcium the galactose-binding protein was observed in complex with SecB (data not shown). This shows that even after 25 h the same principles continue to govern the equilibrium. We eliminated the possibility that calcium interacts directly with SecB to decrease its affinity for its ligands by demonstrating that calcium had no effect on a complex formed between SecB and wild-type mature maltose-binding protein, a ligand that folds at a rate unaffected by the presence or absence of Ca2+. Thus, maltose-binding protein was recovered in complex with SecB whether the size exclusion column was run in calcium or EGTA and whether the complex was initially formed in calcium or EGTA (Fig. 3,A–C). The rate of folding of maltose-binding protein can be increased by raising the temperature, and we have previously shown that a complex can be formed between SecB and maltose-binding protein at 5 °C where the folding is sufficiently slow but not at 25 °C (9Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As further proof that SecB is continuously binding and releasing its ligand, a complex between SecB and maltose-binding protein was formed at 5 °C (Fig. 3 A), and a portion of the sample was warmed to 25 °C. The difference in temperature affects only the folding rate of maltose-binding protein and not the ability of the SecB to bind ligand as has been demonstrated previously by the formation of complexes between SecB and mutationally altered species of maltose-binding protein that fold slowly (9Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Diamond D.L. Strobel S. Chun S.-Y. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As was the case for galactose-binding protein, when the folding rate of the maltose-binding protein ligand increased the complex was disrupted (Fig.4). SecB is classified as a protein chaperone based on its ability to selectively bind polypeptides that are in a nonnative state, but it is distinguished from other members of the family by at least one distinctive property. Whereas the chaperones such as GroEL and the Hsp70s, which facilitate folding, reversibly interact with their ligands in a cycle that is coupled to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP (20Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), SecB does not utilize exogenous energy to carry out its function. As we have shown here the complex between SecB and its ligand is in rapid, dynamic equilibrium with the uncomplexed proteins. Thus the ligand is continuously sampling the free state. It seems likely that this fundamental difference in the modes of binding is related to the fact that SecB is dedicated to protein export, whereas the chaperones that hydrolyze ATP are facilitators of folding of polypeptides. It has been proposed that GroE assists folding by imparting energy to the ligands via the hydrolysis of ATP to let them escape from kinetic traps that exist along the pathway to the low energy, native state (21Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In this model the ligand is completely released from GroE. An alternative hypothesis is that GroE sequesters the folding polypeptide in a chamber within the GroEL·S chaperone complex, and the cycle of binding and hydrolysis of ATP is associated with release into the chamber. In this model the residence time of the ligand associated with the chaperone is regulated to allow folding (22Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As chaperones, both GroEL and SecB bind unfolded proteins, but the function of GroEL is to facilitate folding of its ligand, whereas the function of SecB is just the opposite, to keep its ligands from folding. To play its role in export it simply must capture the polypeptide before it acquires structure so that the ligand will remain in a conformational state compatible with transfer through the membrane. Perhaps the binding mechanism used by SecB provides the least costly way to accomplish this. There is no need to impart energy to the ligand or to increase the residence time of association. In fact, since SecB appears to have no specificity other than for nonnative structure, it is likely that, particularly while nascent, many proteins that are not destined for export might associate with SecB. The fact that binding is readily reversible, rapid, and without need for exogenous energy would minimize the occupancy of SecB by the wrong ligands and maximize efficiency. Proteins that fold rapidly will partition to the native state, and those destined for export, which fold more slowly because of the presence of leader peptide or of other intrinsic folding properties, will rebind with high probability. Yet when SecB binds SecA, the next component of the export pathway, the ligand can be passively passed on provided that SecA has a higher affinity for ligand than does SecB. We thank Vijaya J.

https://openalex.org/W2065815391,"The kinetics of the binding of Ca2+ to the single regulatory site of cardiac muscle troponin was investigated by using troponin reconstituted from the three subunits, using a monocysteine mutant of troponin C (cTnC) labeled with the fluorescent probe 2-[(4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (IAANS) at Cys-35. The kinetic tracings of binding experiments for troponin determined at free [Ca2+] > 1 μm were resolved into two phases. The rate of the fast phase increased with increasing [Ca2+], reaching a maximum of about 35 s−1 at 4 °C, and the rate of the slow phase was approximately 5 s−1 and did not depend on [Ca2+]. Dissociation of bound Ca2+ occurred in two phases, with rates of about 23 and 4 s−1. The binding and dissociation results obtained with the binary complex formed between cardiac troponin I and the IAANS-labeled cTnC mutant were very similar to those obtained from reconstituted troponin. The kinetic data are consistent with a three-step sequential model similar to the previously reported mechanism for the binding of Ca2+ to a cTnC mutant labeled with the same probe at Cys-84 (Dong et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 688–694). In this model, the initial binding in the bimolecular step to form the Ca2+-troponin complex is assumed to be a rapid equilibrium, followed by two sequential first-order transitions. The apparent bimolecular rate constant is 5.1 × 107m−1 s−1, a factor of 3 smaller than that for cTnC. The rates of the first-order transitions are an order of magnitude smaller for troponin than for cTnC. These kinetic differences form a basis for the enhanced Ca2+ affinity of troponin relative to the Ca2+ affinity of isolated cTnC. Phosphorylation of the monocysteine mutant of troponin I by protein kinase A resulted in a 3-fold decrease in the bimolecular rate constant but a 2-fold increase in the two observed Ca2+ dissociation rates. These changes in the kinetic parameters are responsible for a 5-fold reduction in Ca2+ affinity of phosphorylated troponin for the specific site. The kinetics of the binding of Ca2+ to the single regulatory site of cardiac muscle troponin was investigated by using troponin reconstituted from the three subunits, using a monocysteine mutant of troponin C (cTnC) labeled with the fluorescent probe 2-[(4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (IAANS) at Cys-35.

These changes in the kinetic parameters are responsible for a 5-fold reduction in Ca2+ affinity of phosphorylated troponin for the specific site. Muscle contraction consists of a cascade of events involving several protein structural changes and protein-protein interactions within the thick and thin filaments (1Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). For contraction to occur, the N-terminal domain of the myosin heavy chain in the thick filament must first bind to actin in the thin filament. The formation of this active actomyosin complex is, however, inhibited by troponin I. This inhibitory action is regulated in vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscle through the binding of calcium to another troponin subunit, troponin C. This Ca2+ binding releases the inhibition of formation of the actomyosin complex. The crystal structures of sTnC 1The abbreviations used are: s, skeletal muscle; TnC, troponin C; Tn, troponin; TnI, troponin I; TnT, troponin T; c, cardiac muscle; PKA, protein kinase A; DTT, dithiothreitol; IAANS, 2-[(4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. from turkey (2Herzberg O.

Each domain contains two metal ion binding sites, designated as sites I and II in the N-domain and sites III and IV in the C-domain. Sites III and IV have a relatively high affinity for Ca2+(K a ≈ 107m−1) and also bind Mg2+competitively (K a ≈ 103m−1), and sites I and II have a lower Ca2+ affinity and are specific for Ca2+(K a ≈ 105m−1). Current evidence indicates that the two Ca/Mg sites in the C-domain most likely play a structural role, and the Ca2+-specific sites in the N-domain carry out a regulatory function. Cardiac muscle troponin C differs from the skeletal muscle isoform in that site I cannot bind Ca2+ due to several amino acid substitutions in critical positions within the 12-residue Ca2+-binding loop. Although the three-dimensional structure of cTnC has not been determined, it is reasonable to assume, on the basis of sequence homology and similarities in physiologic functions, that its structure is similar to that of sTnC. Reversible Ca2+ binding to the single Ca2+-specific site is believed to induce conformational changes in the N-domain, and these changes appear to modulate the troponin C-troponin I interaction. The precise nature of these conformational changes are still obscure. A useful biophysical approach to delineate Ca2+-induced global structural changes is the use of extrinsic fluorescent probes that are attached to TnC. cTnC contains two cysteine residues, Cys-35 located in the nonfunctional Ca2+-binding loop I and Cys-84 located in the C-terminal end of helix D where the cTnC-cTnI interaction occurs. In a previous study of two monocysteine mutants of cTnC (6Dong W.-J. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 850-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we showed that the probe IAANS covalently linked to Cys-84 is partially buried and sensitive to Ca2+ binding to the single Ca2+-specific site. The same probe attached to Cys-35, however, is highly exposed to solvent and not sensitive to Ca2+ binding. Once incorporated into troponin, the probe attached to the two cysteine residues have very different properties. The fluorescence of IAANS attached to Cys-84 of cTnC within the troponin complex is insensitive to Ca2+ binding, but the fluorescence of the probe attached to Cys-35 within the complex decreases by a factor of 3 in response to Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+-specific site. Similar fluorescence properties of IAANS attached to Cys-35 are observed with the cTnC-cTnI complex. These results provide evidence of involvement of the non-functional binding loop I of cTnC in the Ca2+-induced interaction between cTnC and cTnI. Several previous studies (7Iio T. Kondo H. J. Biochem. 1982; 92: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 8Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 242-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rosenfeld S.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8919-8923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the dissociation and association kinetics of calcium binding to both classes of sites in isolated sTnC and in regulatory complexes containing sTnC. The binding of Ca2+ to the two regulatory sites was suggested to be diffusion controlled (10Jonhson J.D. Nakkula R.J. Vasulka C. Smillie L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8919-8923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the basis of binding data obtained over a narrow range of [Ca2+]. Our recent study of a monocysteine cTnC mutant labeled at Cys-84 with IAANS showed that the Ca2+ binding mechanism is not diffusion controlled but must be described by a three-step sequential model (11Dong W. Rosenfeld S.S. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 688-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have extended this kinetic study of Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+-specific site of cTnC in reconstituted cardiac troponin. For this work, we used the monocysteine cTnC mutant cTnC(C84S) labeled at Cys-35 with IAANS. The overall kinetic mechanism is similar to that for Ca2+ binding to isolated cTnC, but there are significant differences in the rates of individual steps. Phosphorylation of cTnI is found to affect the rates of both Ca2+ binding to and dissociation from the Ca2+-specific site in troponin. cTn was extracted from an ether powder that was prepared from the left ventricles of fresh bovine hearts (12Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Troponin subunits were initially separated on a CM-Sephadex C-50–120 column in the presence of 6 m urea, 50 mm citrate, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Crude cTnC, cTnI, and cTnT were pooled and subsequently purified, separately, on a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column in the presence of 6 m urea. cTnC was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 0.5 m KCl at pH 7.0, while cTnI and cTnT were eluted at pH 8.0 with a gradient from 0 to 0.5 m KCl. The purity of the proteins was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified proteins were lyophilized in the presence of 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmDTT, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, and stored at −20 °C. Cardiac TnC mutant, cTnC(C84S), was genetically generated and characterized as previously reported (11Dong W. Rosenfeld S.S. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 688-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mutant was labeled at Cys-35, as described previously (6Dong W.-J. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 850-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with the fluorescent probe IAANS under denatured conditions, and the degree of labeling was found to be >95%. The binary complex cTnC-cTnI and fully reconstituted cTn were prepared by incubating the IAANS-labeled cTnC mutant with a large excess of the other troponin subunits in buffer A (30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm Ca2+) containing 6 m urea. After 30 min at room temperature, the solutions were dialyzed against buffer A, which also contained 3 m urea and 1 m KCl. The urea and KCl concentrations were then reduced by changing the dialysate to solutions of buffer A containing no urea and a decreasing concentration of KCl in five steps: 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1m KCl. Uncomplexed cTnI and cTnT precipitated during the dialysis in decreasing [KCl] and the precipitate were removed by centrifugation. The samples were then dialyzed against a solution containing 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.3 m KCl (standard buffer). cTnI was phosphorylated by protein kinase A in a medium containing 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT using 125 units of the catalytic subunit/mg of cTnI. The reaction was started by adding ATP to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 20 min. The solution was then dialysed exhaustively at 4 °C against the standard buffer. Previous studies have shown that this protocol produces about 90% phosphorylation of PKA sites in cTnI (13Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out at 20 ± 0.1 °C on an SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer. The bandpass of both the excitation and emission monochromators was set at 3 nm, and the measurements were made in the ratio mode. Emission spectra were corrected for variations of the detector system with wavelengths. Fluorescence quantum yields of IAANS were measured by the comparative method as in previous work (6Dong W.-J. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 850-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A standard calcium solution (Orion) was used in Ca2+titration experiments as described previously (11Dong W. Rosenfeld S.S. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 688-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). EGTA was used to control the level of free calcium, and the free calcium concentrations were calculated by using known stability constants of the chelator for cations and proton as given in Fabiator's algorithm (14Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used to calculate free calcium concentration for the kinetic measurements described below. Transient kinetic measurements were performed at 4 °C on a Hi-Tech Scientific PQ/SF-53 stopped-flow spectrometer equipped with a 150 watt xenon lamp. The dead time of the instrument was determined to be 1.8 ms. For measurements of IAANS fluorescence, the excitation monochromator was set at 325 nm, and the emitted light was isolated at a right angle by a cut-off filter (OG 380) and detected by an EMI9798QB photomultiplier. To measure Quin-2 fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was 339 nm, and the emission was measured with a 445-nm cut-off filter. In a typical binding experiment, one syringe contained a labeled protein complex in the standard buffer containing 5 μmEGTA and 3 mm MgCl2. The other syringe contained the same solution, but without protein, plus different levels of free Ca2+ (0 to -500 μm). The concentration of the protein was about 1 μm after mixing. These conditions ensured that the two C-terminal high affinity Ca/Mg sites were presaturated by Mg2+ and that the single low affinity Ca2+-specific site remained free prior to mixing. The free [Ca2+] was controlled by EGTA. This control was adequate when the total Ca2+ concentration was low, and this allowed calculation of the second-order binding rate constant from rate data obtained at low free [Ca2+] (Fig. 4). There was some uncertainty in the calculated free [Ca2+] at higher total [Ca2+], but this uncertainty was not important because one of the binding rates approached a limiting value with increasing free [Ca2+], and the other rate was insensitive to [Ca2+] (Fig. 4). Dissociation of bound Ca2+was measured by mixing a buffer containing EGTA with an equal volume of labeled protein saturated with Ca2+ as described previously (11Dong W. Rosenfeld S.S. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 688-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The second-order rate constant of Ca2+ binding to EGTA is about 106m−1s−1 (8Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 242-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This rate is considerably slower than the second-order rate constant of Ca2+ binding to cTnC. The rate constant of Ca2+ dissociation from EGTA is 0.3–0.4 s−1 (8Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 242-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), much slower than the binding rate of Ca2+ binding to cTnC. The rates involving EGTA would not contribute to the observed cTnC rates. A number of control experiments were carried out using Quin-2 to directly measure Ca2+dissociation (8Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 242-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Smith S.J. England P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 100: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In these measurements, Ca2+dissociation was monitored by the increase of Quin-2 fluorescence. The final concentrations were 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.3m KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 6 μm protein, 50 μm Ca2+, and 150 μm Quin-2. For each experimental condition, multiple tracings (8Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J.

Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the fluorescence emission spectra of cTn reconstituted with the IAANS-labeled cTnC mutant. In the presence of Mg2+, the intensity at the emission maximum decreased by about 5% with a negligible spectral shift. Ca2+ red-shifted the spectrum by 9 nm and decreased the quantum yield by a factor of 3. Similar Mg2+ and Ca2+-induced spectral changes were observed for the binary complex cTnC-cTnI prepared with the IAANS-labeled cTnC mutant. Table I summarizes the spectral properties of these samples and the corresponding samples prepared with cTnI phosphorylated by PKA.Table IFluorescence properties of mutant cTnC(C84S) labelled with IAANS at Cys-35SampleEGTAMg2+Mg2++ Ca2+λmaxQλmaxQλmaxQnmnmnmcTnC mutant4600.0034600.0274620.029cTnC-cTnI4500.0984510.0934590.033cTn4510.0964520.0894600.032p-(cTnC-cTnI)4510.0924520.0874580.050p-(cTn)4500.0894510.0864580.053The measurements were made at 5 °C with the samples in the standard buffer (EGTA) or in the buffer containing either Mg2+ (3 mm) or Mg2+ (3 mm) + Ca2+. cTnC-cTnI is the binary complex formed between the labeled cTnC mutant and cTnI, and cTn is troponin fully reconstituted with the labeled cTnC mutant and the other native troponin subunits. p-(cTnC-cTnI) and p-(cTn) are the binary complex and reconstituted troponin prepared with cTnI phosphorylated by PKA. λmax is the wavelength of maximum emission, and Q is the quantum yield.

The other parameters are derived from observed rate data for Scheme I. The kinetics of Ca2+ binding to the single regulatory site was studied with IAANS-labeled cTnC reconstituted into cTn. Fluorescence transients showing negative amplitude produced by mixing the cTn with Ca2+ in the presence of Mg2+ are depicted in Fig. 2. Below 1 μm Ca2+, the tracings could be fitted to a single exponential, but above 1 μm, two exponential terms were required. Fig. 3 shows a tracing obtained at 1 μm Ca2+. A one-exponential fit clearly was not acceptable, but an improved and acceptable fit was obtained with two exponential terms. The faster rate constant (λf) increased with [Ca2+], whereas the slower rate constant (λs) did not depend on [Ca2+]. The Ca2+ dependence of these two rate constants is shown in Fig. 4 A. The value of λs was about 3–5 s−1 over the entire range of [Ca2+]. The rate of the fast phase reached a maximum value of about 34–37 s−1 at large [Ca2+], and the initial slope of this plot (Fig. 4 B) was 5.1 × 107m−1 s−1. The amplitude of λf varied from 85 to 60% of the total signal above 1 μm Ca2+. The ratio of the amplitude of λs to λf increased from less than 0.2 to a limiting value of about 0.55 with increasing Ca2+ concentration, and the shape of a plot of this amplitude ratio versus [Ca2+] resembled the λf versus [Ca2+] plot shown in Fig. 4 A (data not shown). When cTn was reconstituted with phosphorylated cTnI, the kinetics was qualitatively unchanged. The fluorescence transients were also biphasic above 1 μmCa2+, with the slower rate constant of 5–8 s−1 that was insensitive to [Ca2+]. The faster rate increased with increasing [Ca2+], reaching a maximum value (about 80 s−1) that is about a factor of 2 faster than that of the nonphosphorylated cTn. The initial slope of this increase of λf was reduced to 1.7 × 107m−1 s−1. These experiments were also carried out with the binary cTnC-cTnI complex, using both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated cTnI. The results were very similar to those obtained with the fully reconstituted cTn, indicating that cTnT in cTn had negligible effects on the rate of Ca2+ binding to the regulatory site.Figure 3A typical kinetic tracing fitted to a one-exponential and a two-exponential function. The tracing was obtained as described in Fig. 2, and the free [Ca2+] after mixing was 1 μm. Panel A shows the two-exponential fit with rate constants λf = 25.3 s−1 (amplitude = 6.6) and λs = 3.1 s−1 (amplitude = 1.9), χR2 = 1.01. Panel B is the residual plot of the two-exponential fit. Panel C shows the residual plot for the best one-exponential fit with a rate constant of 15.2 s−1 (the best fitted curve is not shown), χR2 = 1.99.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetics of Ca2+ dissociation from the Ca2+-specific site was measured with the cTnC-cTnI complex and reconstituted cTn, using IAANS-labeled cTnC. Upon mixing the Ca2+-saturated proteins in the presence of Mg2+with an EGTA buffer, the kinetic tracings showed a large positive amplitude change. The fluorescence increase was completed in about 60 ms when the troponin was reconstituted with nonphosphorylated cTnI, and 30 ms when reconstituted with phosphorylated cTnI (Figs.5 A and 6 A). The fluorescence transients from the cTn reconstituted with nonphosphorylated cTnI could be fitted with a two-exponential function with two rate constants: λd1 = 20.6 s−1 with a 70% of the total fluorescence change, and λd2 = 4.7 s−1 with a 30% of the fluorescence change. When the cTn was reconstituted with phosphorylated cTnI, the rates of both phases increased by a factor of 2: λd1 = 46.9 s−1(66% fluorescence change), and λd2 = 8.9 s−1 (34% fluorescence change). The one-exponential fits of these transients were not satisfactory as shown in Figs.5 B and 6 B. Very similar results were obtained with the cTnC-cTnI complexes. These observed dissociation rates are listed in Table II. The present Ca2+ dissociation results are consistent with those of a previous study (13Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that cTnI phosphorylation by PKA enhanced the rate of Ca2+ release from cTn reconstituted with native cTnC that was doubly labeled with IAANS at Cys-35 and Cys-84. However, the previous study reported a single dissociation rate, in contrast to the biphasic dissociation reported here. The difference is unlikely due to the probe located at two positions in the previous study because IAANS attached to Cys-84 is Ca2+-insensitive in the troponin complex (6Dong W.-J. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 850-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Figure 6The kinetics of dissociation of bound Ca2+ from the regulatory site of cTn reconstituted with labeled mutant cTnC and phosphorylated cTnI. Conditions were the same as given for Fig. 5, the tracing was fitted with a biexponential function: λd1 = 55.1 s−1 (amplitude 6.0), λd2 = 9.9 s−1 (amplitude 3.8), and χR2 = 1.01.

Rosenfeld S.S. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 688-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). No fluorescence change was detected, indicating that IAANS attached to Cys-35 was not sensitive to Ca2+ binding to the Ca/Mg sites. These results are in agreement with the equilibrium fluorescence results. Experiments were performed using native proteins and Quin-2 as the fluorescent Ca2+ chelator to establish whether the IAANS fluorescence transients accurately reflected removal of bound Ca2+ from the Ca2+-specific site rather than conformational changes. The fluorescence of Quin-2 is expected to increase upon chelation of Ca2+ (8Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 242-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Quin-2 was mixed with cTnC previously incubated with an excess of Ca2+sufficient to saturate all three sites, biphasic dissociation kinetic tracings with a positive amplitude were observed (data not shown). The two rate constants were 133 s−1 (35% amplitude) and 7 s−1 (65% amplitude). These amplitudes suggested that the fast phase reflected removal of bound Ca2+ from the single Ca2+-specific site, and the slow phase was associated with Ca2+ removal from the two Ca/Mg sites. These results were in agreement with previous Ca2+ dissociation rate data obtained from cTnC with Quin-2 as the chelator (15Smith S.J. England P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 100: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assignment of the fast phase to Ca2+ removal from the specific site supports our previous conclusion that the single-exponential IAANS transient observed with the cTnC mutant monitors Ca2+dissociation from the specific site (11Dong W. Rosenfeld S.S. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 688-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). With the cTnC-cTnI complex and reconstituted cTn, the Quin-2 transients were also biphasic: the fast rate constant (λ′df) being in the range of 33–38 s−1 (amplitudeA ′df ∼ 26%), and the slow rate constant (λ′ds) in the range of 2–4 s−1 (amplitude A ′ds ∼ 74%).

Bioluminescence is a captivating process in which living organisms convert chemical energy into light. Beetle bioluminescence, including perhaps 2000 species of fireflies (1Lloyd J.E. Herring P.J.

As Equations 1 and 2 indicate, the key firefly luciferase enzyme functions as a monooxygenase, although it does so without the apparent involvement of a metal or cofactor. By some means, amino acid residues are recruited to promote the addition of molecular oxygen to luciferin which is then transformed to an electronically excited state oxyluciferin molecule and CO2, each containing one oxygen atom from molecular oxygen. The light emission process is extremely efficient; nearly a single photon is emitted per reacted luciferin molecule (3Seliger H.H. McElroy W.D. Arch. Biochem.

The recent solving of the crystal structure of luciferase without bound substrates or ligands revealed an apparently unique molecular architecture consisting of two distinct domains (11Conti E.

Early chemical modification studies have failed to document the involvement of any specific amino acid residues in substrate binding or enzyme catalysis. Many of these studies have been hampered by the high nucleophilic reactivity of several of the luciferase cysteine sulfhydryl groups. However, the results of mutagenesis and other studies (12Dementieva E.I. Zheleznova E.E. Kutuzova G.D. Lundovskikh I.A. Ugarova N.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 61: 115-119Google Scholar, 13Vellom, D. C.

Luciferase activity was determined by a previously described peak height-based light assay method (14Branchini B.R. Magyar R.A. Murtiashaw M.M. Magnasco N. Hinz L.K. Stroh J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Luciferase solution concentrations were determined in NaPB by absorbance measurements at 278 nm, ε = 45,560m−1 cm−1 (23Green A.A. McElroy W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 20: 170-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase adenylation activity with 0.1 mm luciferin or BPTC as substrates was assessed by measuring PPi generation at pH 7.8 and 8.6 using the Sigma Pyrophosphate Reagent. Luciferase (0.5–0.6 mg/ml) in NaPB was mixed with BPTC (0.8–100 μm), and solutions were irradiated with a Rayonet 350 lamp (emitted light, 300–400 nm) at a distance of 7 cm. During photolysis, all samples were kept on ice under a Pyrex glass filter. In the standard photoinactivation protocol, no special precautions were made to remove O2. To exclude O2, NaPB solutions were bubbled with argon for 20 min and, in some cases, sodium dithionite (2.5 mm) was included. The reversible inhibition of luciferase by BPTC and HOPhHA was assessed with respect to luciferin and MgATP. For luciferin (6–40 μm), BPTC and HOPhHA levels ranged from 2.5 to 20 μm and 70 to 700 μm, respectively. For substrate MgATP (4–325 μm), BPTC and HOPhHA concentrations were 0.04–13.0 μm and 20–80 μm, respectively. Inhibitory constants (K i) were estimated by linear least squares fits of data from initial velocity measurements performed in the dark. The data with each luciferase substrate were analyzed by the method of Dixon (24Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, NY1979: 332-381Google Scholar), and the K i for MgATP was obtained using the method of Cornish-Bowden for uncompetitive inhibitors. An independent estimate of the BPTC binding constant was made from the irreversible photoinactivation data in Fig. 2. A plot of 1/k obsd versus 1/[BPTC] was used to determineK i and k 3 according to the equation 1/k obsd =K i /k 3[BPTC] + 1/k 3 (24Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, NY1979: 332-381Google Scholar). BPTC-inactivated luciferase (5% activity) and control enzyme preparations (irradiated and dark) were digested withN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone-treated chymotrypsin (protease:protein, 1:20, w/w) in NaPB for 2 h at 25 °C and 3 h at 37 °C and then quenched by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Chymotryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC (14Branchini B.R. Magyar R.A. Murtiashaw M.M. Magnasco N. Hinz L.K. Stroh J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); specific conditions are detailed in the figure legends. The peak associated with BPTC photoinactivation was collected from control and inhibited luciferase preparations (Fig. 3), concentrated by lyophilization, purified by rechromatography, and analyzed by LC/ESMS (14Branchini B.R. Magyar R.A. Murtiashaw M.M. Magnasco N. Hinz L.K. Stroh J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and N-terminal sequencing (Biotechnology Support Facility, University of Kansas Medical Center). Solutions of peptide HHGF, BPTC, and various additives were irradiated in NaPB at room temperature as described under “Luciferase Photoinactivation Studies.” Aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed by RP-HPLC (14Branchini B.R. Magyar R.A. Murtiashaw M.M. Magnasco N. Hinz L.K. Stroh J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Elution conditions were 40 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, using 0.1% aqueous TFA containing linear gradients of acetonitrile: 10% (v/v) for 5 min; 20% after 20 min; and 75% after 60 min. HHGF concentrations were determined by peak integration. In a separate experiment, the products from irradiation of HHGF (200 μm) in the presence of BPTC (400 μm) were analyzed by LC/ESMS. BPTC (Fig.1) was prepared in three steps in 33% overall yield from 4-cyanobenzophenone. The synthetic route was modeled after the preparation of dehydroluciferin developed by White et al. (25White E.H. Rapaport E. Seliger H.H. Hopkins T.A. Bioorg. Chem. 1971; 1: 92-122Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The BPTC structure was confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry, IR, UV-visible, 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy (see “Experimental Procedures”). The high molar absorptivity of BPTC solutions in NaPB (λmax 312 nm, log ε = 4.31) enabled photolysis experiments to be carried out with a Rayonet 350 nm source. Prolonged irradiation of BPTC up to 2 h did not alter its absorption spectrum. In the dark, using 0.1 mm BPTC, 6.0 ± 1.0 nmol of pyrophosphate/min/mg luciferase were released at pH 8.6. Thus, BPTC was a substrate for the luciferase-catalyzed adenylation reaction at pH 8.6 (although not at pH 7.8) as shown in Equation 1. Irradiation of solutions of native luciferase (8 μm) and BPTC (0.8–100 μm) effected a time- and concentration-dependent inactivation of bioluminescence activity (Fig. 2). Identical results were obtained when recombinant enzyme was irradiated with several concentrations of BPTC. Equimolar and higher concentrations of BPTC rapidly inactivated luciferase. Interestingly, substoichiometric levels of BPTC also could fully inhibit the enzyme. The failure of gel filtration, dialysis, and incubation with dithiothreitol to regenerate enzyme activity provided further evidence for the irreversible nature of the photoinactivation process (data not shown). Additional control studies (Table I) demonstrated that luciferase retained full activity when irradiated in the absence of BPTC or when incubated in the dark with BPTC, affirming that the photoinactivation of luciferase required BPTC.Table IControls and protective effects on BPTC photoinactivation of luciferaseAdditions/conditions1-aReaction mixtures containing 8 μmluciferase and 4 μm BPTC in NaPB were irradiated for 40 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Half-life1-bHalf-lives were calculated from rates measured by monitoring loss of enzyme activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.”% loss of activityminBPTC omitted0No irradiation0None7.598HOPhHA (20 mm)75.025MgATP (10 mm)30.155Argon bubbling14.384Sodium dithionite (2.5 mm)301.07NaPB-D2O (96%)4.499Superoxide dismutase (1 unit/ml)7.598Mannitol (10 mm)7.598Sodium azide (10 mm)10.0941-a Reaction mixtures containing 8 μmluciferase and 4 μm BPTC in NaPB were irradiated for 40 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b Half-lives were calculated from rates measured by monitoring loss of enzyme activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Steady-state kinetic analysis (data not shown) of the effect of BPTC (without irradiation) on luciferase flash height generation demonstrated that BPTC was a very good reversible competitive inhibitor (K i = 3.0 ± 0.3 μm) with respect to substrate luciferin (K m = 15 ± 4.0 μm) (26Branchini B.R. Hayward M.M. Bamford S. Brennan P.M. Lajiness E.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The measured K i value for BPTC is similar to that reported (18Denburg J.L. Lee R.T. McElroy W.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 134: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) for dehydroluciferin (K i = 1.0 μm), the structure BPTC was designed to resemble. With respect to substrate MgATP (K m = 110 μm) (27DeLuca M. McElroy W.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), BPTC was found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor (K i = 0.55 ± 0.05 μm). The BPTCK i value was independently estimated to be 7.5 μm from analysis of the irreversible inactivation data presented in Fig. 2 (inset). Attempts to determine whether luciferin or known analogs could protect against BPTC photoinactivation were unsuccessful because these compounds absorb strongly in the irradiated region. To circumvent this problem, we prepared HOPhHA (Fig.1), the absorption spectrum of which is transparent between 300 and 400 nm. With respect to luciferin and MgATP, HOPhHA was determined to be a reversible competitive inhibitor (K i = 160 ± 20 μm) and an uncompetitive inhibitor (K i = 9.0 ± 1.0 μm), respectively. HOPhHA (20 mm) was effective in preventing BPTC photoinactivation of luciferase by ∼75% (Table I), indicating that a substantial portion of the enzyme modification is proximal to the luciferin binding site. A protective effect of only ∼45% by MgATP (10 mm) was observed in a similar experiment. RP-HPLC was used to separate proteolytic fragments generated from control and photoinactivated luciferase digested with chymotrypsin, trypsin, or endoproteinase Glu-C. Only chymotrypsin digests presented a pattern of peptides with any differences between control and inactivated samples, the sole difference being a ∼75% decrease in the area of the peak indicated by an asterisk in Fig.3. The decrease in area of this peak was directly correlated with the loss of enzyme activity (data not shown). However, no new peaks appeared in the digest of inactivated protein. The peaks designated in Fig. 3 were further purified by rechromatography (Fig. 3, inset). By Edman sequencing and LC/ESMS, both peaks were found to contain two coeluting peptides, HHGF (MH+ = 497.4) and VRGPM (MH+ = 559.4), corresponding to regions 244–247 and 392–396 in the deduced luciferase sequence (6deWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). The mole percentage of HHGF:VRGPM in the peak from the control sample was estimated from the sequencing data to be 78:22. In the photoinactivated sample, the HHGF content decreased ∼70%, while the amount of VRGPM remained unchanged. Therefore, the loss of peptide 244HHGF247 was correlated to the BPTC-mediated photoinactivation process. The absence of any evidence for BPTC-peptide adduct formation suggested that no true photoaffinity labeling had occurred during the photoinactivation process. Instead, it seemed likely that photooxidation of one or both of the imidazole side chains of 244HHGF247 may be a major cause of luciferase inactivation. A model study was undertaken in which synthetic HHGF (200 μm) was irradiated with BPTC (400 μm). As evidenced by the analysis of the reaction products by LC/ESMS (Fig. 4), BPTC did catalyze the photooxidation of HHGF. Moreover, the formation of the putative products (Fig. 4, inset), assigned from the mass data and by analogy to reported studies (28Ryang H.-S. Foote C.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 6683-6687Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Holden-Day, San Francisco1971: 165-169Google Scholar) on the dye-sensitized photooxidation of histidine, suggested that BPTC irradiation generates singlet oxygen. Additional model studies (TableII) supported the involvement of singlet oxygen: (i) sodium azide, a scavenger of singlet oxygen prevented degradation of HHGF; (ii) the use of buffers prepared in deuterium oxide, which prolongs the lifetime of singlet oxygen, accelerated HHGF photooxidation 3-fold; (iii) superoxide dismutase and mannitol, reagents that destroy superoxide and hydroperoxide radicals, respectively, had very little or no effect; and (iv) reduction of soluble oxygen by argon bubbling slowed the rate of HHGF photooxidation, while sodium dithionite, which removes soluble oxygen (30O'Fallon J.V. Wright Jr., R.W. Calza R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), nearly halted the process. None of these reagents affected HHGF photooxidation in the absence of BPTC.Table IIEffects of oxygen depletion, quenchers, and solvent on the rate of BPTC-mediated photooxidation of HHGFAdditions/conditions2-aReaction mixtures containing 8 μm HHGF and 200 μm BPTC in NaPB were irradiated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Half-life2-bHalf-lives were calculated from rates measured by monitoring [HHGF] using RP-HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.”% loss of HHGF2-cValues calculated from RP-HPLC peak area measurements after 60 min of irradiation.minNone23.884Sodium azide (10 mm)0NaPB-D2O (87%)7.799Superoxide dismutase (1 unit/ml)17.890Mannitol (10 mm)24.382Argon bubbling3864Sodium dithionite (2.5 mm)509.4112-a Reaction mixtures containing 8 μm HHGF and 200 μm BPTC in NaPB were irradiated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-b Half-lives were calculated from rates measured by monitoring [HHGF] using RP-HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-c Values calculated from RP-HPLC peak area measurements after 60 min of irradiation. Open table in a new tab The results of luciferase photoinactivation experiments in which soluble oxygen was reduced by argon bubbling and sodium dithionite indicated decreased or strongly suppressed enzyme inhibition (Table I). A control trial showed that sodium dithionite had no effect on BPTC stability. Therefore, unlike photoaffinity labeling experiments that are usually retarded by oxygen, BPTC-mediated photoinactivation required it. Since substoichiometric concentrations of BPTC completely inactivated luciferase (Fig. 2) and since BPTC was not consumed in the process (Fig. 3), the benzophenone derivative must function as a photooxidation catalyst. Although sodium azide only modestly protected luciferase against BPTC photooxidation, evidence supporting the involvement of singlet oxygen included (TableI): (i) a 1.7-fold decrease in the inhibition half-life measured in deuterium oxide buffers; and (ii) the failure of superoxide dismutase or mannitol to alter the inactivation rate. Since Cys, Met, Tyr, Trp, and His are especially susceptible to photooxidation (31Matheson I.B.C. Lee J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1979; 29: 879-881Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we compared the content of these amino acids in irradiated control and BPTC-inactivated luciferase (TableIII). A loss of His consistent with the determined level of 244HHGF247 photooxidation and a very minor decrease in Cys were the only differences noted (including all other amino acids not shown in Table III).Table IIIPartial amino acid analysis of luciferase irradiated with and without BPTCAmino acidPredicted3-aValues deduced from the cDNA sequence (6).Irradiated control3-bValues for Cys are averages based on duplicate thiol titrations (14).

Open table in a new tab Molecular modeling was used to design BPTC, a dehydroluciferin analog containing a benzophenone moiety (Fig. 1). BPTC very effectively inactivated luciferase irreversibly by a process requiring irradiation (Fig. 2). Furthermore, luciferase modification occurred at or near the luciferin binding site as: (i) BPTC was found to be a substrate for the adenylation reaction shown in Equation 1; (ii) the aryl ketone derivative was an effective reversible competitive inhibitor (K i = 3.0 ± 0.3 μm) with respect to luciferin; and (iii) the BPTC-promoted inactivation process was effectively retarded by the luciferin analog HOPhHA (TableI). BPTC also was shown to be an uncompetitive inhibitor (K i = 0.55 ± 0.05 μm) with respect to another luciferase substrate, MgATP. Since MgATP provided modest protection against photoinactivation, a portion of the luciferase inactivation may occur at a second site, possibly an allosteric binding site for ATP (32Lembert N. Idahl L.-A. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using proteolysis, RP-HPLC, LC/ESMS, and Edman sequencing (Fig. 3), we identified a single luciferase peptide, 244HHGF247, the degradation of which was directly correlated to luciferase photoinactivation. However, since complete enzyme inhibition was accompanied by the loss of only ∼70–75% of the peptide, the BPTC-mediated photoinactivation process must occur at more than one site, possibly a cysteine residue. While HHGF was identified as the major site of luciferase modification by comparison to controls, no modified peptides were found. As suggested by model studies (Fig. 4), several modified HHGF peptides probably were formed, but no single one was produced at a measurable level. The modification of luciferase at 244HHGF247 could not, as expected for a benzophenone derivative, be associated with photoaffinity labeling because: (i) the photoinactivation process required oxygen; (ii) substoichiometric amounts of BPTC fully inactivated luciferase; (iii) no BPTC-HHGF adduct was detected; and (iv) BPTC was not consumed during the photoinactivation process. Instead, BPTC is a catalyst for luciferase photooxidation. There are many examples of substituted aryl ketones functioning as triplet sensitizers (35Chattopadhyat S.K. Kumar C.V. Das P.K. J. Photochem. 1985; 30: 81-91Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the BPTC structure, the extended conjugation provided by the para-substituted thiazole ring must shift the key electronic transition fromn-π* to π-π*, thereby producing a molecule much less reactive to H abstraction required for photoaffinity labeling (19Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The extended conjugation in the BPTC structure also may make it a more efficient triplet sensitizer. Although it is difficult to distinguish between type II (singlet oxygen) and type I (electron transfer between an excited triplet state and a substrate molecule) photodynamic processes, we propose that BPTC generates singlet oxygen at the luciferase active site in very close proximity to the peptide 244HHGF247. The results of model studies undertaken with synthetic HHGF (Table II; Fig. 4) strongly support our contention that BPTC is a sensitizer for singlet oxygen production. Likewise, evidence consistent with BPTC-promoted singlet oxygen inactivation of luciferase was compiled (Table I). However, two significant differences were noted between the enzyme and model studies: (i) azide ion was much less effective in protecting the protein; and (ii) the enzyme inactivation process was ∼150 times faster than the photooxidation of the model peptide. Previously, Seliger and co-workers reported (33Thompson A. Nigro J. Seliger H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) the inactivation of luciferase with singlet oxygen generated by irradiating an immobilized Rose Bengal catalyst. They determined that luciferase was ∼10 times more sensitive to singlet oxygen than histidine. The even greater sensitivity of luciferase to BPTC-photooxidation than the actual peptide being modified very likely reflects the close proximity of both oxygen and BPTC to the 244HHGF247 region. The failure of sodium azide to retard luciferase photooxidation in our study presumably reflects the inability of the ion to reach the enzyme site of singlet oxygen generation. To explain the greater sensitivity of luciferase to singlet oxygen, Seliger proposed (33Thompson A. Nigro J. Seliger H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that a histidine residue was located at a putative enzyme binding site for molecular oxygen. Mutagenesis studies support a similar proposal for the importance of a histidine residue in oxygen binding in the bioluminescent photoprotein aequorin (34Ohmiya Y. Tsuji F.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Possibly, in the firefly protein, the region 244HHGF247 is involved in binding oxygen for subsequent addition to the luciferyl adenylate (Equation 2). BPTC binding near this site would be expected to make His-244 and/or His-245 the most susceptible residue(s) to photooxidation as we have observed. Alternatively, the tetrapeptide may be involved in luciferin binding. Interestingly, His-245 is conserved among all of the 13 known firefly luciferase sequences (8Wood K.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 662-673Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Preliminary results of ongoing mutagenesis studies support an important functional role for His-245 since the mutant proteins H245Q and H245A show altered light emission kinetics and ∼200- and ∼400-fold lower relative activities, respectively, compared with wild-type luciferase. Furthermore, 244HHGF247 is located in the 226–250 region of the luciferase primary sequence in which minor changes produce dramatic shifts in the color of bioluminescence (8Wood K.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 662-673Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Ohmiya Y. Hirano T. Ohashi M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This region is part of the β-sheet B subdomain, which is located in the large N-terminal domain of the luciferase structure (11Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It appears that the tetrapeptide is located near an internal cavity containing ordered water molecules. The cavity is in a surface groove close to several invariant residues that comprise the putative luciferase active site (11Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). When the x-ray coordinates become available, it will be possible to better determine the location of the 244HHGF247 in the luciferase three-dimensional structure. We have described here an uncommon example of active site-directed photooxidation of an enzyme by singlet oxygen. At least one other example of site-directed photooxidation has been reported (36Smith S.B. Benisek W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2690-2693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the active species responsible for oxidation of a Cys residue in Δ-3-ketosteroid isomerase was not determined. The benzophenone group, so useful in photoaffinity labeling studies (19Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), has been used here to efficiently catalyze the photooxidation of a histidine-containing firefly luciferase peptide. Potentially, BPTC and other substituted benzophenones with extended conjugation may prove generally useful as site-directed photooxidation reagents. We are currently investigating this possibility and extending the ongoing mutation studies to better determine the functional role of 244HHGF247 in firefly bioluminescence.

https://openalex.org/W1977777327,"The role of CD4 during the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) life cycle in T cells is not restricted to binding functions. HIV-1 binding to CD4 also triggers signals that lead to nuclear translocation of NF-κB and are important to the productive infection process. In addition to its cytoplasmic tail, in the ectodomain, the immunoglobulin (Ig) CDR3-like region of CD4 domain 1 seemed to play a role in this cascade of signals. We demonstrate in this work that the structural integrity of the CDR3-like loop is required for signal transduction. Substitutions of negatively charged residues by positively charged residues within the CDR3-like loop either inhibited NF-κB translocation after HIV-1 and gp120-anti-gp120 immune complexes binding to E91K,E92K mutants or induced its constitutive activation for E87K,D88K mutants. Moreover, A2.01–3B cells expressing the E91K,E92K mutant exhibited a lower HIV-1Lai replication. These cells, however, expressed p56 lck, demonstrated NF-κB translocation upon PMA stimulation, bound HIV-1Lai envelope glycoprotein with high affinity, and contained HIV-1 DNA 24 h after exposure to virus. E91K, E92K, and E87K,D88K mutant CD4 molecules were unable to bind a CD4 synthetic aromatically modified exocyclic, CDR3.AME-(82–89), that mimics the CDR3-like loop structure and binds to native cell surface CD4. This result together with molecular modeling studies indicates that the CDR3.AME-(82–89) analog binds to the CDR3-like loop of CD4 and strongly suggests that this region represents a site for CD4 dimerization. The negative charges on the CDR3-like loop thus appear critical for CD4-mediated signal transduction most likely related to CD4 dimer formation. The role of CD4 during the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) life cycle in T cells is not restricted to binding functions. HIV-1 binding to CD4 also triggers signals that lead to nuclear translocation of NF-κB and are important to the productive infection process. In addition to its cytoplasmic tail, in the ectodomain, the immunoglobulin (Ig) CDR3-like region of CD4 domain 1 seemed to play a role in this cascade of signals. We demonstrate in this work that the structural integrity of the CDR3-like loop is required for signal transduction. Substitutions of negatively charged residues by positively charged residues within the CDR3-like loop either inhibited NF-κB translocation after HIV-1 and gp120-anti-gp120 immune complexes binding to E91K,E92K mutants or induced its constitutive activation for E87K,D88K mutants. Moreover, A2.01–3B cells expressing the E91K,E92K mutant exhibited a lower HIV-1Lai replication. These cells, however, expressed p56 lck, demonstrated NF-κB translocation upon PMA stimulation, bound HIV-1Lai envelope glycoprotein with high affinity, and contained HIV-1 DNA 24 h after exposure to virus. E91K, E92K, and E87K,D88K mutant CD4 molecules were unable to bind a CD4 synthetic aromatically modified exocyclic, CDR3.AME-(82–89), that mimics the CDR3-like loop structure and binds to native cell surface CD4. This result together with molecular modeling studies indicates that the CDR3.AME-(82–89) analog binds to the CDR3-like loop of CD4 and strongly suggests that this region represents a site for CD4 dimerization. The negative charges on the CDR3-like loop thus appear critical for CD4-mediated signal transduction most likely related to CD4 dimer formation. The CD4 molecule is an integral membrane glycoprotein that contains four extracellular domains (D1–D4) showing structural homology with immunoglobulin Vκ regions (1Ryu S.E. Kwong P.D. Truneh A.

Beside its physiological function, CD4 is known to be the primary high affinity cellular receptor for HIV-1. The virus outer envelope glycoprotein (HIV-1gp120 env) can bind to a protruding ridge located within the IgVκ-like D1 domain of CD4 at the CDR2-like region (8Sattentau Q. Weiss R.A.

Increasing evidence indicates that the role played by CD4 during the HIV-1 life cycle in T cells is not limited to its ability to serve as a receptor for the virus but probably plays other roles that are important to the productive infection process. Indeed, it has been found that transfected cells expressing mutated forms of CD4 that lack the cytoplasmic domain are fusion competent and yet present a defect in a latter stage of HIV-1 replication cycle which results in delayed HIV-1 production (10Bedinger P.

Virol. 1991; 65: 4893-4901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies have demonstrated that truncation of CD4 cytoplasmic domain blocks NF-κB translocation induced by HIV-1-mediated oligomerization of native CD4, leading to the conclusion that under certain circumstances HIV-1 can take advantage of the signal transduction function of CD4 to prepare the cell for postfusion events (13Benkirane M.

Biol. 1995; 41: 445-452PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that HIV-1 binding to CD4 at the surface of peripheral blood mononuclear cells activates tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of transducing proteins, including phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase-2 which are possible intermediates in the activation pathway(s) that regulates the activity of the viral promoter (15Schmid-Antomarchi H. Benkirane M. Breittmayer V. Husson H. Ticchioni M. Devaux C. Rossi B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and activates NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors (16Briant L. Coudronnière N. Robert-Hebmann V. Benkirane M. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3994-4004PubMed Google Scholar). Although the CDR3-like loop in D1 of CD4 plays no role (17Corbeau P. Benkirane M. Weil R. David C. Emiliani S. Olive D. Mawas C. Serre A. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 290-301PubMed Google Scholar) or a minor role (18Signoret N. Blanc-Zouaoui D. Kwong P. Sattentau Q.J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) for HIV-1 entry, this region may play an important role during HIV-1 replication. This was suspected from antiviral properties of antibodies directed to this region of D1 (17Corbeau P. Benkirane M. Weil R. David C. Emiliani S. Olive D. Mawas C. Serre A. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 290-301PubMed Google Scholar) and synthetic peptides resembling the CDR3-like loop (19Lifson J.D. Hwang K.M. Nara P.L. Fraser B. Padgett M. Dunlop N.M. Eiden L.E. Science. 1988; 241: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). More recently, we have demonstrated that anti-CD4 mAb specific for the CDR3-like region inhibited HIV-1 promoter activity and HIV transcription in cells containing an integrated provirus(es) (20Benkirane M. Corbeau P. Housset V. Devaux C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4909-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Benkirane M. Hirn M. Carrière D. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6898-6903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these mAbs inhibit HIV-1 induced mitogen-activated protein kinase-2 activation (22Benkirane M. Schmid-Antomarchi H. Littman D.R. Hirn M. Rossi B. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6904-6910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HIV-1-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB (23Lemasson I. Briant L. Hague B. Coudronnière N. Heron L. David C. Rebouissou C. Kindt T. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 859-865PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the CDR3-like loop is involved in signal transduction triggering T cell activation. Based on the observation that CDR3-like loop-derived synthetic peptide can bind CD4, it has been proposed (24Langedijk J.P.M. Puijk W.C. van Hoorn W.P. Meloen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16875-16878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that this region may be involved in CD4 dimerization process which may be required for CD4-dependent T cell activation. Recently, a constrained aromatically modified exocyclic (AME) analog that mimics the CDR3-like loop secondary structure, CDR3.AME-(82–89), was shown to inhibit CD4-MHC class II binding and T cell activation (25Zhang X. Piatier-Tonneau D. Auffray C. Murali R. Mahapatra A. Maier C.C. Saragovi H. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since the CDR3.AME analog binds to cell surface CD4 molecules it has been proposed that the AME prevents the formation of an essential homodimeric surface involving the CDR3-like region of CD4 (25Zhang X. Piatier-Tonneau D. Auffray C. Murali R. Mahapatra A. Maier C.C. Saragovi H. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we investigated further the structural requirements of the CDR3-like loop responsible for the cascade of signal transduction events that lead to NF-κB translocation after HIV-1 binding to CD4 and probed the role played by the negative charges in this region by using a series of A2.01 T cell clones expressing different mutants of CD4. We demonstrate that the negatively charged residues at positions 87, 88, 91, and 92 in the CDR3-like loop play a critical role during the initiation of the activation signal transduction and in the binding of the CDR3.AME-(82–89) analog to CD4. Moreover, molecular modeling data show that the CDR3.AME-(82–89) analog can bind to the CDR3-like loop and indicate that residues 87, 88, 91, and 92 are essential for CD4 dimerization. Anti-CD4 mAbs 13B8–2/IOT4A (IgG1), specific for the CDR3-like loop, and BL4/IOT4 (IgG2a) which binds to the D1–D2 of CD4 were provided by M. Hirn (Immunotech, Marseille, France); ST40/F142.63 (IgG1) which binds to the CDR3-like loop was provided by D. Carrière (Sanofi Corp., Montpellier, France); Leu 3a (IgG1) specific for the CDR2-like loop and FITC-conjugated OKT4 were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Erembodegem-Aalst, Belgium) and Ortho Diagnostics Systems (Raritan, NJ), respectively. Anti-p56 lck mAb (3A5) was purchased from TEBU (Le Perray en Yvelines, France); anti-actin (C4) mAb was from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Anti-HLA class I mAb (B9-12-1) was provided by M. Hirn (Immunotech). FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse (GAM) immunoglobulins were purchased from Immunotech. Recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) was a gift from D. Klatzmann (Hôpital de la Pitié-Salpétrière, Paris, France). Purified (>90%) HIV-1 recombinant soluble envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120) produced in baculovirus expression system was purchased from ABT (ABT Europe, London, UK). gp120-anti-gp120 immune complexes were formed by incubating 50 μl of gp120 at 100 μg/ml with 50 μl of human anti-gp120 immunoglobulins and 50 μl of sheep anti-human Ig (Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, UK), as described previously (17Corbeau P. Benkirane M. Weil R. David C. Emiliani S. Olive D. Mawas C. Serre A. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 290-301PubMed Google Scholar). The CD4 CDR3.AME-(82–89) analog was synthesized by solid phase methods as described previously (25Zhang X. Piatier-Tonneau D. Auffray C. Murali R. Mahapatra A. Maier C.C. Saragovi H. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fluoresceinated CDR3.AME-(82–89) analog was prepared using FITC kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma and was used at 10 ng/ml in cell cultures. The A3.01 (a CD4 positive cell line) (26Folks T. Benn S. Rabson A. Theodore T. Hoggan M.D. Martin M. Lightfoote M. Sell K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was provided by T. Folks (Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA). The previously described (12Poulin L. Evans L.A. Tang S. Barboza A. Legg H. Littman D.R. Levy J.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4893-4901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) A2.01/CD4 cells expressing the wild type CD4 and A2.01/CD4.403 cells expressing a truncated form of CD4 were provided by D. Littman (New York, NY). The A2.01 cell clones transfected with the wild type CD4 or CD4 mutants in the Ig CDR3-like loop were previously described (18Signoret N. Blanc-Zouaoui D. Kwong P. Sattentau Q.J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutations were introduced in the CD4 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis, and then the mutated sequence was substituted into the full-length CD4 cDNA present in the retroviral vector pMV7, and A2.01 cells were transfected with the mutant CD4 cDNA using a retrovirus shuttle. A2.01-c26 was transfected with the wild type CD4 gene but fails to express CD4 although it is neomycin-resistant. A2.01-M1 clone expresses CD4 mutant E87G, A2.01-M2 mutant Q89L, A2.01–2B the double mutant E87K,D88K, and A2.01–3B clones (A2.01–3B-1 and A2.01–3B-2, respectively) the double mutant E91K,E92K. Cells were cultured at a density of 5 × 105 per ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic mixture, glutamax, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Eragny, France), in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 mg/ml was added to the culture medium of transfected A2.01 cells. The origin of CEM and MT2 cells was described previously (23Lemasson I. Briant L. Hague B. Coudronnière N. Heron L. David C. Rebouissou C. Kindt T. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 859-865PubMed Google Scholar). Viral stocks (HIV-1Lai) were prepared from the chronically infected CEM cell supernatants, as described previously (27Corbeau P. Devaux C. Kourilsky F. Chermann J.-C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and kept frozen at −80 °C until use. After thawing, 100 μl of these stock viruses at 103 × TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose)/ml was used for infection assays. Heat-inactivated virus was prepared by incubation for 30 min at 56 °C. Cells (5 × 105) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in flat-bottom 96-microwell plates (cell culture top performance product (TPP)) with 100 μl of HIV-1 at 103 × TCID50 per ml. Thereafter, cells were washed five times and cultured at 37 °C in 24-microwell plates (TPP). The amount of virus produced by the cells was monitored twice a week by measuring reverse transcriptase activity in 1 ml of cell-free culture supernatant, as described previously (27Corbeau P. Devaux C. Kourilsky F. Chermann J.-C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 105) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with PBS containing 0.2% BSA (PBS-BSA) or PBS-BSA supplemented with anti-CD4 mAb at concentrations necessary for saturation of cell surface CD4. After washing three times with PBS-BSA, bound mAb was revealed by addition of 50 μl of a 1:50 dilution of fluoresceinated GAM Ig (Immunotech). After 30 min staining, cells were washed with PBS-BSA, and fluorescence intensity was measured on an EPICS cytofluorometer (Coulter, Margency, France). In some experiments, cells (1 × 106) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 μl of gp120 solution (100 μg/ml), washed, and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of anti-gp120 env mAb 110-4 (28Bahraoui E. Clerget-Raslain B. Chapuis F. Olivier R. Parravicini C. Yagello M. Montagnier L. Gluckman J.-C. AIDS. 1988; 2: 165-169PubMed Google Scholar) solution (10 μg/ml). Bound gp120-antibody complexes were revealed by FITC-labeled GAM Ig probe as above. In another set of experiments, A2.01, A2.01/CD4, A2.01–2B, and A2.01–3B T cell lines (2 × 105) were incubated with FITC-conjugated CDR3.AME-(82–89) analog diluted at 1:50 in PBS-BSA or with a FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb OKT4 for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed in cold PBS-BSA. Background staining was assessed with a FITC-conjugated mAb specific for chicken Ig (Sigma). PCR detection of reverse-transcribed RNAs was performed according to the previously published procedure with slight modifications (17Corbeau P. Benkirane M. Weil R. David C. Emiliani S. Olive D. Mawas C. Serre A. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 290-301PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted in guanidinium thiocyanate from 4 × 106 cells and resuspended in 40 μl of H2O, 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate. To reduce the amount of DNA originating from lysis, supernatants were treated with RNase-free DNase (Boehringer Mannheim, 10 units/ml) for 30 min at 20 °C and then for 5 min at 65 °C. To 2 μg of RNA sample (10 μl) was added 200 ng of oligo(dT) primer (1 μl) for 10 min at 65 °C. Each sample was made up with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 30 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 9 mm DTT, 320 nm dNTPs) to a final volume of 25 μl and supplemented with 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim) and 25 units of avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim), and then incubated for 90 min at 42 °C. PCR were carried out on 4 μl of sample supplemented with an amplification mixture containing the p56-I/p56-II or TK I/TK II oligonucleotide primer pair (23Lemasson I. Briant L. Hague B. Coudronnière N. Heron L. David C. Rebouissou C. Kindt T. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 859-865PubMed Google Scholar), and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The amplification reaction was run in a PHC2 thermal cycler (Techne, Cambridge, UK). The amplified products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel, blotted for 2 h onto Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.), and hybridized with α-32P-labeled p56 lck probe prepared from pGEX2t-lck vector provided by S. Fisher (ICGM, Paris). A similar method was used for detection of HIV-1 mRNAs using the M671/VPR3 oligonucleotide primer pair (29Briant L. Benkirane M. Girard M. Hirn M. Iosef C. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5213-5220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an α-32P-labeled HIV-1 probe. HIV-1 DNA was monitored by PCR analysis (see above) using the M667/M668 oligonucleotide primer pair (20Benkirane M. Corbeau P. Housset V. Devaux C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4909-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The PCR was performed on total DNA extracts (1 μg) prepared from cells at 24 h following virus exposure. The amplified products were electrophoresed, blotted, hybridized with an α-32P-labeled HIV-1 probe, and visualized by autoradiography. Cellular lysates were electrophoresed onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blot was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a blocking solution (PBS containing 10% milk and 0.05% Tween 20) prior to addition of mAb. After 1 h at 20 °C, the blot was washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min with 1:5000 dilution of GAM Ig peroxidase conjugate (Immunotech). After 3 washes, bound mAb was detected by incubating the membrane for 1 min with ECL reagent (Amersham Corp.). The membrane was then exposed for 0.5–5 min to hyperfilms-ECL (Amersham Corp.). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (13Benkirane M. Jeang K.-T. Devaux C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 106) were centrifuged, transferred into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and washed 3 times in PBS by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (containing 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8). After 15 min on ice, 50 μl of a solution of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to the sample, and cells were homogenized by vortexing and microcentrifuged at 4 °C for 30 s. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer B (containing 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm Hepes pH 7.8) and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C on a shaker. The nuclear extracts were microcentrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C until used. The NF-κB mobility shift assay was performed using 2 μg of protein of nuclear extract, 1 × 105 cpm of32P-labeled probe (a double-stranded oligonucleotide NF-κB with a HIV-1 sequence: sense strand only, 5′-GCTGG GGACT TTCCA GGGAG GCGT-3′) in buffer C (containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm ZnSO4, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Hepes pH 7.9), supplemented with BSA, tRNA, and poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 20 μl. After 20 min at room temperature, the mixture was run at 120 V in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Sp-1 mobility shift assay was performed using a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (sense strand only, 5′-GGAGG CGTGG CCTGG GCGGG ACTGG GGAGT GGCGA-3′). Molecular modeling was carried out using QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc., Cambridge, MA). The coordinates of CD4 were obtained from Brookhaven Protein data base (30Berstein F.L. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8136) Google Scholar), and the solvent molecules were removed. The mutant models were minimized while holding the remainder of the structure fixed except CDR3-like region, preserving the overall structure. The entire structure was subjected to conjugate gradient energy minimization for 2000 cycles to convergence, followed by an equilibration and production run of molecular dynamics at 300,000 for 60 ps. Molecular dynamics was performed to allow a change in the conformation in the loop, if more favorable. All energy calculations were performed at a dielectric constant of 1. Final energy values were calculated using CHARMm which is part of QUANTA. Electrostatic calculations were performed with GRASP (31Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar). Charged amino acid groups were assigned full charges as provided in GRASP. The electrostatic calculations were performed with distance-dependent dielectric constants from 1, at the interior, to 80, at the outer surface. The CDR3-AME cyclic peptide adopts very similar conformation of the native CDR3 loop of CD4 (25Zhang X. Piatier-Tonneau D. Auffray C. Murali R. Mahapatra A. Maier C.C. Saragovi H. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A dimeric model of CD4 was built with D1 as dimeric interface using an antibody VH-VL domain as template. The CDR3-AME peptide was positioned by superimposing the CDR3-AME to the CDR3 of one of the dimeric molecule. Since this region is solvated, no attempt was made to dock this peptide to the CD4 molecule. The positioning was done only for reference purpose. To analyze whether the CDR3-like region in the first extracellular domain of the CD4 molecule may be involved in HIV-1-induced NF-κB translocation, we used a series of CD4 mutants that have been recently constructed (18Signoret N. Blanc-Zouaoui D. Kwong P. Sattentau Q.J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and were stably expressed in the A2.01 T cell line, a CD4 negative line derived from the CD4 positive parent A3.01 (5Houlgatte R.

Fig. 1summarizes the amino acid changes introduced in the CD4 molecule. Mutant CD4 molecules with a substitution of Gly for Glu at position 87 (E87G) were expressed in A2.01-M1 cell line; the Q89L substitution was expressed in A2.01-M2 and the double substitutions E87K,D88K in A2.01–2B and E91K,E92K in A2.01–3B. A3.01 cells that express the native CD4 molecule, A2.01-c26 which did not express CD4 although transfected with the CD4 wild type gene, and A2.01/CD4.403 cells expressing a truncated form of CD4 lacking the whole cytoplasmic domain were used as controls. The CD4 phenotype of the A3.01 and A2.01 cell lines and of the different clones was studied by indirect immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry. Representative cytofluorometric profiles are shown in Fig.2. A2.01-c26 was the only clone that was not stained with anti-CD4 mAb. All other clones expressed CD4, although there were slight variations in the level of expression; binding of anti-CD4 mAb BL4 was found with all these cells. Binding of anti-CD4 mAb ST40 was disrupted only for clones A2.01–2B and A2.01–3B expressing CD4 molecules with the double substitutions E87K,D88K and E91K,E92K, respectively. As shown in Fig.3, the different clones used in this study expressed the lck mRNA (Fig. 3 A), and the p56 lck protein was detected (Fig. 3 B), indicating that conditions for CD4-dependent signal transduction through p56 lck were conserved.Figure 2Cell-surface expression of CD4 and mutant forms of the CD4 molecule in transfected A2.01 cells. Cells were incubated with medium alone (to determine the background), anti-CD4 mAb Leu 3a, 13B8-2, ST40, or BL4, or anti-HLA class I mAb B9–12-1. mAb binding was detected by a FITC-labeled GAM Ig.

It is unclear, however, whether expression is directly related to the efficiency of DNA transfer. In an attempt to correlate DNA transfer with transgene expression, we used a simple assay consisting of measuring DNA (3H-plasmid encoding for β-galactosidase) binding to murine (B16/BL6) and human (KZ) melanoma cells in vitro at 4 and 37 °C. The difference in cell association at these temperatures was assumed to be a consequence of DNA uptake, an assumption that was confirmed by protease removal of cell surface-associated DNA. DNA associated with B16/BL6 melanoma cells (up to 30 ng or 12% of the added DNA) following incubation with dioleoyldimethylammonium chloride/dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) liposome-DNA aggregates was comparable to that achieved with 1,2-dioleoyloxypropyl-3-trimethylammonium bromide/DOPE or dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide/DOPE liposomes; however, transgene expression was 2- and 5-fold less for the latter two formulations, respectively. Similarly, equivalent amounts of DNA delivery were achieved with B16/BL6 and KZ melanoma cells, yet the level of transgene expression in the KZ cells was undetectable. It was demonstrated that the lack of transgene expression was not a consequence of cell-specific differences in DNA degradation.

Although the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in cationic liposome-mediated gene transfer is limited, DNA delivered by this process must ultimately gain access to the nucleus if effective expression of the foreign gene is to take place (1Smith J.G. Walzem R.L. German B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Experiments to date have focused on the development of various lipid formulations in an effort to identify an efficient carrier as measured by transgene expression (2Barthel F. Remy J.-S.

This approach is useful for comparing expression levels following plasmid DNA transfer using different lipid formulations, but it provides little information regarding the usefulness of such formulations to effectively deliver DNA to the cells. Binding of the liposome-DNA complex to the cell membrane and entry of the DNA into the cell are the initial steps of the transfection process, and these are important considerations in the development of effective cationic liposome-mediated gene transfer systems.It is evident, however, that the liposome-DNA aggregates are heterogeneous with respect to size and shape (5Hofland H. Huang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Wasan E.K. Reimer D.L. Bally M.B. J. Pharmacol.

Transfection can be achieved using this heterogeneous population of aggregates, but the complex that is directly responsible for mediating the transfection process is still unknown. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which plasmid DNA in this heterogeneous mixture is delivered to a cell remains a mystery. It is currently thought that DNA-cationic liposome aggregates gain access to the cell by endocytosis (9Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). However, the liposomes used to prepare the complexes have the potential to fuse with membranes, thereby providing an alternative mechanism by which foreign DNA can be delivered into the cytoplasm of the cell (10Behr J.-P.

We designed a simple DNA delivery assay to complement these transfection studies. Delivery of intact DNA was determined as a function of the amount of DNA added and gene expression. Measurement of cell-associated DNA is not an accurate predictor of whether a specific cell line will be transfected or whether the cationic liposomes employed will be more or less effective than other cationic liposomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDDAB was purchased from Sigma, and DOPE was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). DODAC was synthesized and supplied by Steven Ansell of Inex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (Vancouver, BC). [14C]Cholesterylhexadecyl ether was purchased from Amersham Corp. (Oakville, ON). Lipofectin (DOTMA/DOPE, 50:50 mol %) was supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. Triton X-100 was purchased from Bio-Rad, and chlorophenol red β-galactopyranoside was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Laval, Quebec). All other chemicals used in this study were reagent grade and solvents used were high performance liquid chromatography grade.The murine B16/BL6 melanoma cell line was obtained from NCI Tumor Repository 12-102-54 (Bethesda, MD) and was maintained in RPMI 1640 with 5% FBS. KZ, a human melanoma cell line, was a gift from Dr. Wright (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA) and was maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with no antibiotics.The 7.2-kb plasmid pCMVβ (GenBank accession number U02451) encoding the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase was obtained fromCLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA) and was used for analyzing DNA delivery and transfection analyses. The 4.5-kb plasmid, pInexCATv2.0, was constructed by Roger Graham of Inex Pharmaceuticals Corp (Vancouver, BC) and contains the E. coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and avian myeloblastosis virus enhancer. This plasmid was used for the assessment of intact DNA, since this plasmid can be separated from genomic DNA in a 0.8% agarose gel. Plasmid DNAs were isolated using standard molecular techniques (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and purified using Qiagen Plasmid Purification Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Radiolabeled plasmids were generated by culturing E. Coli pCMVβ or pInexCATv2.0 with [3H]thymidine-5′-triphosphate (NEN Life Science Products) and purified using standard techniques. Specific activity of3H-pCMVβ and 3H-pInexCATv2.0 were approximately 50,000 and 200,000 dpm/μg, respectively.MethodsPreparation of Liposomes and Liposome-DNA ComplexesPre-formed DOTMA/DOPE liposomes (50:50 mol %) were supplied under the trade name Lipofectin. These liposomes were prepared by sonication and exhibited a mean diameter of 50–70 nm as measured by quasi-elastic light scattering. DODAC/DOPE (50:50 mol %) and DDAB/DOPE (50:50 mol %) liposomes were prepared according to the method of Hopeet al. (22Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). Lipids were dissolved in chloroform (50 mg/ml) and radiolabeled at a specific activity of 1–2 mCi/50 mg with [14C]cholesterylhexadecyl ether as a non-exchangeable liposomal lipid marker (23Scherphof G.L. Kuipers F. Derksen J.T.P. Spanjer H.H. Vonk R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1987; 15: 625-628Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The lipids were dried to a thin film under a stream of nitrogen gas and vacuum-dried at >76 mm Hg for at least 4 h. The films were hydrated in H2O. The hydrated lipid solutions were passed 10 times at 65 °C through an extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, BC) containing three stacked 100-nm polycarbonate membranes. The resulting liposomes were evaluated for lipid concentration by measuring the levels of [14C]cholesterylhexadecyl ether using a Packard TR 1900 scintillation counter. The size of the liposomes was measured by quasi-elastic light scattering using a Nicomp Submicron Particle Sizer (model 270, Pacific Scientific, Santa Barbara, CA) operating at a wavelength of 632.8 nm. All liposomes used exhibited a mean diameter of 100–140 nm, and these were stored at 4 °C until use. Liposomes were used within 2 months of preparation and liposome size did not change during storage.Prior to use, liposomes were diluted into sterile distilled H2O to a final lipid concentration ranging from 100 to 1000 μm. Plasmid DNA was diluted into sterile distilled H2O at concentrations ranging from 10 to 60 μg/ml. Ten μl of diluted liposomes were mixed with 10 μl of DNA in a microcentrifuge tube at the desired concentrations and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-liposome complexes were used immediately for transfection.Transfection AnalysisB16/BL6 and KZ cells were trypsinized, and ∼1700 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well flat bottom microtiter plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and incubated overnight. At the time of transfection, the media were removed, and 80 μl of serum free RPMI 1640 was added to each well. Twenty μl of prepared liposome-pCMVβ complexes were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h. The complex containing media was subsequently removed and replaced with 200 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS. The cells were incubated for a further 48 h prior to assessment for β-galactosidase activity as described below.Media were removed from each well of the microtiter plate, and the adherent cells were washed 2 × with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. The cells were lysed by the addition of 50 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 mmsodium phosphate (pH 8.0) to each well. Subsequently, 150 μl of chlorophenol red β-galactopyranoside (1 mg/ml in 60 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mmMgSO4, 10 mm KCl, and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) was added to each well, and the samples were left to incubate at room temperature. Absorbances at 570 nm were measured at regular time intervals using a Titertek Multiscan Type 310C microtiter plate reader (Flow Laboratories, Mississauga, ON). A standard curve using a range of concentrations of β-galactosidase (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% bovine serum albumin was also generated. Enzyme activity in transfected cells was calculated by comparing A 570 obtained with the β-galactosidase standard concentration curve and were expressed as milliunits of β-galactosidase/well.Analysis of DNA DeliveryB16/BL6 and KZ cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 48-well flat bottom plates (Falcon Labware, Mississauga, ON) and incubated overnight. At the time of transfection, media were removed, and 80 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 was added to each well. Twenty μl of prepared liposome-DNA complexes were added to each well and incubated at 37 or 4 °C for 1–4 h. At the appropriate time interval, the supernatant consisting of non-cell-associated DNA-liposome complexes was removed from each well and retained for scintillation counting. Each well was rinsed carefully with 200 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 and pooled with supernatant containing DNA-liposome complexes. Washed cells were lysed in 300 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% SDS for 5 min, and the lysate was retained for scintillation counting. Each well was rinsed with 100 μl of lysis buffer and pooled with matched lysates. Pico-Fluor scintillant (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) was added to all samples, and the radioactivity (3H-pCMVβ) was measured in a Canberra Packard TR 1900 Scintillation Counter (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT).In an attempt to evaluate whether DNA associated with the cells at 37 °C was internalized, transfected B16/BL6 cells were protease-treated prior to sample collection. B16/BL6 cells were transfected for 4 h at 4 and 37 °C as described above using DODAC/DOPE liposomes complexed to 3H-pInexCATv2.0. Adherent cells were removed from wells by trypsinization at 4 °C for 2 min using 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and diluted with 400 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution. Subsequently, cell-associated DNA was separated from unassociated DNA-liposome complexes by fractionating cells on a gradient consisting of NycoPrep (Sigma) layered at densities of 1.077 and 1.022. Cells were collected at the 1.022/1.077 interface following centrifugation at 400 ×g for 30 min at room temperature, and the amount of plasmid DNA associated with the cells was evaluated by scintillation counting. Control studies revealed that free plasmid and the liposome-DNA complexes were consistently found above the 1.022 fraction.Assessment of Intact DNAB16/BL6 cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well, and KZ cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 48-well flat bottom plates (Falcon Labware, Mississauga, ON) and incubated overnight in a 37 °C incubator. Liposome-DNA complexes were prepared using3H-pInexCATv2.0 as described previously. The 4.5-kb plasmid pInexCATv2.0 was used for these experiments because the migration of the three conformations of plasmid can readily be separated from genomic DNA in a 0.8% agarose gel. At the time of transfection, media were removed from all wells and replaced with 80 μl of serum-free medium. Twenty μl of prepared liposome-3H-pInexCATv2.0 complexes were added to each well and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 4 h. Six hundred μl of media (with 5% FBS for B16/BL6 and 10% FBS for KZ) was added to each well and incubated for a further 24 h.Medium containing 3H-pInexCATv2.0-liposome complexes was removed and retained for scintillation counting. Each well was rinsed carefully with 200 μl of serum-free media, pooled with supernatant, and radioactivity (3H-pInexCATv2.0) evaluated by scintillation counting. Cells were lysed by the addition of 400 μl of 0.6% SDS, 10 mm EDTA. Cell lysates were collected in microcentrifuge tubes, the wells rinsed with 100 μl of lysis buffer, and pooled with respective cell lysates. Samples were further processed following the method of Hirt (24Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. This procedure selectively precipitates genomic DNA leaving the smaller molecular weight plasmid DNA in the supernatant, thereby enhancing the detection of plasmid DNA following gel electrophoresis. NaCl was added to cell lysates at a final concentration of 1 m, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was recovered and further purified. DNA was extracted from the supernatant once with equal volumes Tris-HCl-buffered phenol/chloroform (1:1) and precipitated with 0.1 volumes 3 m sodium acetate and 0.7 volumes isopropyl alcohol. DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the pellet resuspended in 10 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA. Control samples were also evaluated by adding free DNA or DNA-liposome complexes to untransfected cell lysates and processed along with test samples. All experiments were performed in triplicate.The integrity of the DNA was evaluated by two methods. First, the presence of intact plasmid DNA was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Each DNA sample (containing DNA isolated from a single transfection from a 48-well plate) was loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 80 V in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA) for 45 min. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) for 20 min and photographed with UV transillumination (Ultra Violet Products, San Gabriel, CA). Second, the amount of 3H-pInexCATv2.0 associated with the three plasmid bands was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The area of the agarose gel encompassing the three 3H-pInexCATv2.0 plasmid bands was excised and placed into a scintillation vial with 500 μl of H2O. Each sample was boiled in a water bath for ∼10 min until the gel slice was fully melted. Pico-Fluor scintillant was added to each sample and the radioactivity measured.Statistical AnalysisQuantitative data generated for β-galactosidase activity, and the DNA uptake studies were statistically evaluated using regression analysis from the Microcal Origin version 3.5 computer program (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Analysis of variance was used to determine statistical significance of β-galactosidase activity and DNA uptake in different liposome formulations and in different cell lines using Statistica (Statistica Software Inc., Tulsa, OK).RESULTSAlthough the mechanisms of liposome-mediated transfection are not understood, the ratio of cationic lipid to DNA is known to be important for optimal efficiency in vitro (25Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4317) Google Scholar). The optimal ratio occurs when the number of positive charges incorporated into the cationic liposome is greater than the number of negative charges on the DNA (2Barthel F. Remy J.-S. Loeffler J.-P. Behr J.-P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), thereby promoting association of the liposome-DNA aggregates with the negatively charged surface of the cell. It is believed that cationic liposomes provide a multivalent surface to bind plasmid DNA, thus protecting the DNA from degradation (26Bertling W.M. Gareis M. Paspaleeva V. Zimmer A. Kreuter J. Nurnberg E. Harrer P. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1991; 13: 390-405PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these liposomes are thought to effectively neutralize the negative charges (1Smith J.G. Walzem R.L. German B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The quantity of DNA required and the optimal DNA phosphate to cationic lipid ratio for efficient transfection, however, varies with cell type (27Gao X.A. Huang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 28Farhood H. Bottega R. Epand R.M. Huang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).Initial experiments in this study evaluated the transfection efficiency of a mouse melanoma cell line (B16/BL6) using DODAC/DOPE liposomes and pCMVβ plasmid DNA. To determine the optimal cationic liposome:DNA ratio required for this cell line, pre-formed liposomes were added to plasmid DNA at various lipid and DNA concentrations as described under “Methods.” The results presented in Fig. 1 show that the transfection efficiency for this cell line was dependent on both factors. Regardless of the amount of DNA used, lipid concentrations of 50 μm showed β-galactosidase activity of <1 milliunit/well (Fig. 1 A). The positive to negative charge ratio for these samples ranged from 1.62 to 16.23. The expression level increased more than 10-fold when 100–300 μm lipid was used for the transfection assays (up to 11 milliunits/well when the DNA concentration was 20 μg/ml). Lipid concentrations of 500 μm showed consistently lower levels of β-galactosidase activity (<7 milliunits/well) compared with 100–300 μmlipid. This was due to lipid-induced toxicity associated with high concentrations of lipid. The apparent maximum level of expression was obtained using 20 μg/ml DNA and either 100 or 300 μmlipid (Fig. 1 B). The charge ratios for these samples were 0.81 and 2.40, respectively. It is important to note that β-galactosidase activity was linearly related to the amount of DNA added when using a constant liposome-DNA charge ratio of 1.62 (50 μm lipid: 5 μg/ml DNA; 100 μm lipid: 10 μg/ml DNA; and 300 μm lipid: 30 μg/ml DNA) giving a regression coefficient of 0.91 (data not shown).The first steps of transfection are binding of the complex to the cell and entry of DNA into the cytoplasm. From Fig. 1, we propose that increased transfection should correlate with the amount of cell-associated DNA. DNA binding was measured under conditions comparable to those for transfection, where DODAC/DOPE liposomes were mixed with 3H-pCMVβ plasmid such that the final lipid and DNA concentrations were 100 μm and 10 μg/ml, respectively. This corresponds to a +/− charge ratio of 1.62. This ratio was selected based on transfection data (Fig. 1) that generated a transgene expression level that was midway between the minimum (<1 milliunits/well) and maximum (>10 milliunits/well) activity. This ratio also falls within the range of optimal transgene expression achieved in our laboratory using a variety of other cell lines 2S. Kong, personal communication. and is comparable to optimal charge ratios reported by other investigators (3Felgner J.H. Kumar R. Sridhar C.N. Wheeler C.J. Tsai Y.J. Border R. Ramsey P. Martin M.

B16/BL6 cells, incubated at 37 °C, were exposed to this complex in serum-free media as described under “Methods” for times ranging from 1 to 4 h. At the appropriate time interval, the complexes were removed from the cells, and the amount of 3H-pCMVβ in the cell lysate was measured. As a control, the amount of cell-associated DNA obtained when cells were incubated at 4 °C was measured. Fig.2 A shows the amount of pCMVβ associated with B16/BL6 cells over the 4-h transfection period at 37 and 4 °C. For both temperatures, there was a time-dependent increase in the amount of DNA associated with these cells. However, this increase was less evident at 4 °C than at 37 °C. The difference in cell-associated DNA levels obtained at 37 °C minus 4 °C was defined as temperature-dependent cell-associated DNA. The data presented in Fig. 2 B show that this value increased over a 3-h incubation period. Based on the addition of 200 ng of pCMVβ to the cells, a total of approximately 30 ng (12% of the added DNA) was bound to the B16/BL6 cells in a temperature-dependent process. It can be suggested from these data that 60–65% of the cell-associated DNA measured at 37 °C is a consequence of binding events that occur in metabolically inactive cells maintained at 4 °C. Similar results were obtained using the plasmid pInexCATv2.0 (data not shown), which suggests that the binding of the complex to the cell is not plasmid-specific.Figure 2DNA associated with (A) and DNA taken up by (B) B16/BL6 cells at various time points following transfection with DODAC/DOPE-pCMVβ liposomes (100 nmol of lipid, 10 μg of DNA).

It is worth noting that the cationic-liposome-DNA aggregates used here are heterogeneous and unstable. It can be argued, for example, that the characteristics of aggregates may change as a consequence of incubation temperature. Studies in our laboratory, however, have demonstrated that once formed these aggregates are stable in terms of lipid components. Specifically, lipid mixing assays 3E. Wasan, unpublished observations. demonstrated that significant lipid mixing occurred when DNA was added to DODAC/DOPE liposomes. Dilution in media resulted in additional lipid mixing and further aggregation. Regardless, the samples incubated with cells at 4 and 37 °C are heterogeneous, and we cannot discount whether differences observed were a result of subtle changes in the attributes of the aggregates at the two temperatures. To establish whether the cell-associated DNA measured using the assay described in Fig. 2 was not a consequence of differences at 4 °C, we completed a 37 °C control study where the cells were treated with trypsin to dissociate liposome-DNA complexes bound through protein interactions at the cell surface. Following the 4-h transfection at 4 and 37 °C, cells were washed extensively to remove unassociated DNA. Subsequently, the cells were trypsinized as outlined under “Methods.” Trypsinized cells were then subjected to centrifugation on a NycoPrep gradient. This procedure was developed to separate nonspecifically bound DNA-liposome aggregates from those that are internalized. As a control for the efficiency of trypsin removal of surface-associated liposome-DNA aggregates, we evaluated cells that were measured at 4 °C. Following trypsinization and separation on a NycoPrep gradient, 6.91 ± 0.45 ng of 3H-pInexCATv2.0 remained associated with the cells at 4 °C, suggesting that 85% cell-associated DNA could be removed by trypsin. As shown in Fig. 3, at 37 °C 23.20 ± 3.51 ng of 3H-pInexCATv2.0 was associated with B16/BL6 cells after trypsinization in comparison to 57.36 ± 4.39 measured in the absence of trypsin. The level measured in the absence of trypsin was not significantly different than that shown in Fig. 2 A. Furthermore, the level of cell-associated DNA recovered at 37 °C after trypsin (23.20 ± 3.51 ng) was not sig"

(1995)Glycobiology 4, 99). Phosphotransferase recognizes a conformation-dependent protein determinant that is present in lysosomal hydrolases, but absent in most secretory glycoproteins. To identify the amino acid residues of DNase I that are required for interaction with phosphotransferase, wild-type and mutant forms of bovine DNase I were expressed in COS-1 cells and the extent of oligosaccharide phosphorylation determined. Phosphorylation of DNase I oligosaccharides decreased from 12.6% to 2.3% when Lys-50, Lys-124, and Arg-27 were mutated to alanines, indicating that these residues are required for the basal level of phosphorylation. Mutation of lysines at other positions did not impair phosphorylation, demonstrating the selectivity of this process. When Arg-27 was replaced with a lysine, phosphorylation increased to 54%, showing that phosphotransferase prefers lysine residues to arginines. Mutation of Asn-74 to a lysine also increased phosphorylation to 50.3%, and the double mutant (R27K/N74K) was phosphorylated 79%, equivalent to the values obtained with lysosomal hydrolases. Interestingly, Lys-27 and Lys-74 caused selective phosphorylation of the neighboring Asn-linked oligosaccharide. Finally, mutation of Lys-117 to an alanine stimulated phosphorylation, demonstrating that some residues may be negative regulators of this process.

In many cell types, the sorting of newly synthesized acid hydrolases from secreted proteins is mediated by the phosphomannosyl recognition system (1Kornfeld S. J. Clin.

The interaction of phosphotransferase with its acid hydrolase substrates results in the transfer of GlcNAc-P to mannose residues on the Asn-linked high mannose oligosaccharides of the lysosomal hydrolases. The GlcNAc residues are then removed by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-N-acetylglucosaminidase to generate phosphomannosyl residues which mediate binding of the hydrolases to mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptors present in the Golgi. These complexes are subsequently translocated via clathrin-coated vesicles to endosomes where the hydrolases are discharged for packaging into lysosomes. While phosphotransferase acts primarily on lysosomal hydrolases, a few secretory glycoproteins acquire Man-6-P moieties (11Herzog V. Neumuller W. Holzmann B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Lee S. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3521-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kovacina K.S.

Glycobiology. 1995; 4: 99Google Scholar). One of these is human DNase I which is secreted by the pancreas and the salivary gland (14Cacia J. Quan C. Frenz J. Glycobiology. 1995; 4: 99Google Scholar). Since DNase I is a relatively small protein which has been cloned from several species and its crystal structure has been determined (15Shak S. Capon D.J. Hellmiss R. Marsters S.A. Baker C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9188-9192Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 16Suck D. Oefner C. Kabsch W. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2423-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Suck D.

Nature. 1988; 332: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), we reasoned that this would be an excellent model for studying how secretory glycoproteins acquire Man-6-P residues. In this study we have focused on bovine DNase I which undergoes limited mannose phosphorylation when expressed in COS-1 cells. We show that this low level of phosphorylation is dependent on selected lysine and arginine residues. Interestingly, substitution of a different lysine with an alanine enhances the extent of phosphorylation, indicating that this particular lysine residue impairs phosphorylation. Most strikingly, insertion of two lysines that are present in the mouse sequence but absent in the bovine sequence results in a dramatic increase in the extent of phosphorylation. Furthermore, each of these critical lysines stimulates phosphorylation of a different Asn-linked oligosaccharide. COS-1 cells were obtained from ATCC. [2-3H]Mannose was purchased from NEN Life Sciences Products Inc. QAE-Sephadex, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and the pSVK3 expression vector were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Recombinant endoglycosidase H fused to maltose-binding protein and Protein A-agarose beads were from New England Biolabs and Repligen, respectively. Bovine calf serum, Lipofectin, and Opti-MEM were from Life Technologies, Inc. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The human DNase I cDNA (15Shak S. Capon D.J. Hellmiss R. Marsters S.A. Baker C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9188-9192Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) containing the signal sequence region was subcloned into the pSVK3 expression vector. Bovine DNase I cDNA lacking a signal sequence (18Worrall A.F. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21889-21895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. D. Suck (EMBL, Heidelberg). To prepare the bovine DNase I expression vector, an AflII restriction site was introduced into the human DNase I cDNA at the site where anAflII restriction site already existed in the bovine cDNA (amino acid residues 1–2 of mature sequence). This was accomplished using the sequential polymerase chain reaction procedure (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Brooklyn, NY1989Google Scholar) and did not result in any change in the amino acid coding sequence. Next the portion of the cDNA encoding the mature human DNase I (minus the signal sequence) was excised (the AflII to HindIII site) and replaced by the same region of the bovine DNase I cDNA. The expression vectors containing the various mutations in the bovine DNase I cDNA were also constructed using the sequential polymerase chain reaction procedure. All plasmids used for transfections were purified with the Qiagen plasmid kit. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. The cells were transfected with purified plasmid DNA using the Lipofectin method as follows: on the day before transfection, approximately 2 × 105 cells were plated into a 60-mm culture dish and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in a CO2 incubator. Three micrograms of plasmid DNA were dissolved in 100 μl of Opti-MEM. Lipofectin solution was prepared by mixing 5 μg of Lipofectin and 100 μl of Opti-MEM. The DNA and Lipofectin solutions were gently mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline followed by 2 ml of Opti-MEM. Then 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM and the Lipofectin-DNA complex were added to the plate. After 24 h of incubation, the transfection reagents were replaced with 3 ml of culture medium. Following an additional 24-h incubation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 1.0 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed bovine serum, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm NH4Cl, and 200 μCi of [2-3H]mannose for 4 h at 37 °C. Then 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm mannose, and 10 mm NH4Cl was added to stop the uptake of [2-3H]mannose. The culture medium was harvested 4 h later. Rabbit anti-bovine DNase I serum was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with bovine DNase I purchased from Sigma and purified one additional step on a concanavalin A-Sepharose column. Rabbit anti-human DNase I serum was prepared using recombinant human DNase I as antigen (15Shak S. Capon D.J. Hellmiss R. Marsters S.A. Baker C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9188-9192Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The harvested culture media were incubated with 2 μl of antisera overnight with rotation at 4 °C. Then 100 μl of a 50% Protein A-agarose bead suspension was added. After 1 h of additional rotation, the bead suspension was transferred to a fresh tube. The beads were washed three times with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin. The immunoprecipitated protein was eluted from the beads in 50 μl of 0.5% SDS, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol by heating at 78 °C for 10 min and rinsing the beads with 50 μl of water. Oligosaccharide analysis and the calculation of phosphorylation percentage were carried out according to the previously described methods (8Dustin M.L. Baranski T.J. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The alignment of bovine, human, and mouse DNase I sequences reveals that they are very similar (Fig. 1). All four proteins have potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites at positions 18 and 106. Bovine DNase I has nine lysine residues (positions 2, 15, 50, 77, 88, 117, 124, 126, and 157). Of interest, there are four positions where mouse DNase I contains lysines but bovine and human DNase I do not (positions 27, 59, 74, and 261). Since lysines have been shown to be important components of the phosphotransferase recognition site on acid hydrolases, the nine lysines on bovine DNase I were mutated individually to either an alanine or a glutamine and the effect on mannose phosphorylation determined. In the standard assay, plasmids encoding the various mutant proteins were transfected into COS-1 cells and the expressed proteins were labeled with [2-3H]mannose. The secreted molecules were immunoprecipitated and their [3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides were analyzed for the level of phosphorylation by ion exchange chromatography on QAE-Sephadex as described previously (8Dustin M.L. Baranski T.J. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since the COS-1 cells secrete most of the DNase I regardless of the extent of phosphorylation, this material is representative of the total that is synthesized (data not shown). The data are summarized in Fig.2. The wild-type bovine DNase I had 12.6% of its oligosaccharides phosphorylated, mostly with a single Man-6-P residue. Six of the lysine mutations had no significant effect on the extent of phosphorylation while two mutations (K50A and K124A) caused a modest decrease in phosphorylation (10 and 10.3%, respectively). When these two lysines were mutated in the same construct, inhibition of phosphorylation was more marked (7.7% phosphorylation). It is also of note that the K50A and K124A mutations caused a marked decrease in the formation of oligosaccharides with two Man-6-P residues. In contrast to these results, mutation of Lys-117 → alanine (K117A) produced a large stimulation of oligosaccharide phosphorylation (28.3%), with most of the oligosaccharides containing a single Man-6-P residue. Thus Lys-117 appears to impair phosphorylation of the oligosaccharides in DNase I. In the next set of experiments, lysine residues were placed at positions 27, 59, 74, and 261 since mouse DNase I has lysines at these locations (Fig. 1). The addition of a lysine at either position 27 (R27K) or position 74 (N74K) resulted in a 4-fold increase in oligosaccharide phosphorylation (53.9 and 50.3%, respectively) (Fig.2). Furthermore, the increased phosphorylation in the R27K mutant was exclusively in oligosaccharides with one phosphate while the N74K mutation stimulated the formation of oligosaccharides with two phosphates. When Asn-74 was changed to an arginine, the increase in phosphorylation was only 2-fold, although all of the increase was in oligosaccharides with two phosphates. Replacement of Asn-74 with an alanine had no effect, demonstrating that this asparagine residue does not inhibit phosphorylation. Of note, substitution of Arg-27 with an alanine residue decreased the extent of phosphorylation to 9.4%. Thus at both positions 27 and 74, arginines have a modest stimulatory effect on phosphorylation, but are considerably less active than lysine residues at these positions. The location of the lysines was critical for the stimulatory effect. When the arginine at position 73 was replaced with a lysine (R73K), the oligosaccharide phosphorylation was only 19.6%, in sharp contrast to the effect of having a lysine at position 74. Similarly, a construct with a lysine at position 75 (S75K) was phosphorylated at the basal level of 12.2% (data not shown). When Arg-73 was mutated to Ala (R73A), there was a modest decrease in the basal phosphorylation to 10.2%. However, the R73A/N74K double mutant was phosphorylated as well as N74K single mutant (49.6 and 50.3%, respectively), demonstrating that the arginine at position 73 does not contribute in a major way to the level of oligosaccharide phosphorylation. The placement of a lysine at position 59 (D59K) had only a small stimulatory effect on phosphorylation (16.5%). To prepare the final construct, threonine 260 was mutated to an arginine and two additional amino acids were added to give the mutation T260RKT. This construct was phosphorylated to the same extent as the wild-type bovine DNase I (12.6%), indicating that a lysine at position 261 does not enhance phosphorylation. The analysis of the various lysine mutants implicated lysines at positions 27 and 74 as being strongly stimulatory, lysines at positions 50 and 124 as being weakly stimulatory, and Lys-117 as impairing oligosaccharide phosphorylation. To determine whether these lysines acted independently or cooperatively, constructs containing various combinations of these residues were prepared and analyzed in the standard COS-1 assay system (Table I). Construct 1, which has the three stimulatory residues present in bovine DNase I mutated to alanines (R27A/K50A/K124A), was phosphorylated only 2.3%, indicating that these residues account for most of the basal phosphorylation that occurs with wild-type bovine DNase I. Construct 2, which has lysine residues at positions 27 and 74 in addition to the lysines at positions 50 and 124, was phosphorylated to a very large extent (79.2%). And construct 3, which contains the lysines at the four positive positions as well as having the inhibitory lysine at position 117 replaced with an alanine, was almost completely phosphorylated (94.9%), with 44% of the oligosaccharides containing one Man-6-P residue and 51% having two Man-6-P residues. By comparison, the lysosomal protease cathepsin D is phosphorylated about 60% in the COS-1 cell expression system whereas the secretory protein glycopepsinogen is phosphorylated less than 0.1% (data not shown).Table IEffect of combinations of lysine mutations on oligosaccharide phosphorylationConstructResidues% Oligosaccharide phosphorylationLys-27Lys-50Lys-74Lys-124Lys-117WT(R)+−1-a−, indicates a Lys → Ala mutation.++12.61−−−−+2.32+++++79.23++++−94.9COS-1 cells transfected with the various constructs were labeled with [2-3H]mannose and the secreted DNase I was immunoprecipitated from the media.

Open table in a new tab COS-1 cells transfected with the various constructs were labeled with [2-3H]mannose and the secreted DNase I was immunoprecipitated from the media. The labeled oligosaccharides were analyzed to determine the percentage of phosphorylated Asn-linked oligosaccharides. The results given for constructs 1–3 are the average of two to three separate experiments. Using the data in Fig. 2 and Table I, it can be calculated that the effects of the lysines at positions 27 and 74 are almost additive. Thus the R27K construct is phosphorylated 41.3% over the basal level (53.9–12.6%) whereas the N74K construct is phosphorylated 37.7% over the basal value (50.3–12.6%). If the effects are independent, the double mutant should be phosphorylated 91.6% (12.6% + 41.3% + 37.7%) and the observed value was 79.2%. Bovine DNase I has two Asn-linked glycosylation sites, one at position 18 and the other at position 106. To analyze the effects of the various lysines on phosphorylation at these sites, constructs were prepared in which one or the other glycosylation site was deleted. This provided a convenient way to determine whether the lysines were influencing phosphorylation at the individual glycosylation sites or at both sites. The results of these experiments are summarized in TableII. It is apparent that the R27K substitution selectively stimulated phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at position 18 whereas the N74K substitution caused the selective phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at position 106. Mutation of the lysine at position 117 to an alanine resulted in enhanced phosphorylation at both sites. Mutation of Lys-50 to alanine caused a selective loss of phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at position 106. These experiments also revealed that the oligosaccharide at position 106 mostly acquired two Man-6-P residues whereas the oligosaccharide at position 18 acquired only one Man-6-P residue, regardless of the extent of phosphorylation.Table IIEffect of lysine mutations on phosphorylation at specific glycosylation sitesGlycosylation site% Oligosaccharide phosphorylationConstructHM + 1PMHM + 2PMTotalAsn-18WT13.11.414.5R27K57.43.761.1N74K13.00.613.6K117A33.44.137.5R27K/K50A57.54.361.8Asn-106WT12.97.520.4R27K11.49.220.6N74K7.281.688.8K117A18.622.841.4N74K/K50A13.349.262.5Constructs were prepared in which either Asn-18 or Asn-106 was changed to a Gln and the other mutations were made as noted.

The DNase I produced in the bovine pancreas contains a single oligosaccharide located at Asn-18 with the potential Asn-linked glycosylation site at position 106 not being utilized (21Paudel H.K. Liao T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16012-16017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard Shakin-Eshleman and co-workers (22Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) have reported that the sequence Asn-Asp-Ser (which is the sequence at positions 106–108 in bovine DNase I) is poorly glycosylated in a cell-free translation system supplemented with canine pancreas microsomes whereas the sequence Asn-Ala-Thr (which is the sequence at positions 18–20 in DNase I) is efficiently glycosylated. Since the bovine DNase I expressed in COS-1 cells is well glycosylated at both sites, there must be cellular differences in the preference for the X residue in the sequence Asn-X-(Ser/Thr). The fact that the COS-1 cells utilized both glycosylation sites on DNase I made this a useful cell line for this study. It is also advantageous that the COS-1 cells secrete the majority of DNase I under the conditions of the assay. The initial indication that DNase I was a substrate for phosphotransferase came from the work of Cacia et al. (14Cacia J. Quan C. Frenz J. Glycobiology. 1995; 4: 99Google Scholar) who showed that DNase I isolated from human urine contained Man-6-P residues on its Asn-linked oligosaccharides. In preliminary experiments we found that about 4% of the oligosaccharides of human DNase I expressed in COS-1 cells contain Man-6-P residues, compared with the 12.6% value that was obtained with bovine DNase I. Bovine DNase I was therefore chosen for use in the experiments to define the phosphotransferase recognition domain. Our data indicate that most of the base-line phosphorylation of bovine DNase I depends on three residues, Lys-50, Lys-124, and Arg-27. When these residues were mutated to alanines, the extent of mannose phosphorylation dropped from 12.6 to 2.3%. Substitution of these residues individually showed that each contributes about equally to the phosphorylation. Since replacement of all three residues failed to decrease phosphorylation to the level observed in a standard secretory glycoprotein (<0.1%), we conclude that the DNase I must have additional residues that contribute, albeit weakly, to the phosphotransferase-binding site. It is important to note, however, that not every lysine exhibits activity in this assay. Thus mutation of the lysines at positions 2, 15, 20, 77, 80, 126, and 157 to alanines did not impair mannose phosphorylation. The most dramatic effects were observed when lysine residues were placed at positions 27 and 74 (the R27K and N74K constructs). Individually these mutations stimulated phosphorylation about 4-fold and the double mutant had 79% of its oligosaccharides phosphorylated. Substitution of Asn-74 with an arginine (N74R) caused a 2.5-fold enhancement of phosphorylation while the N74A mutation had no effect on this process. This latter result excludes the possibility that the stimulatory effect of the lysine (and arginine) substitution at position 74 is actually due to relief from an inhibitory effect of the asparagine at this position. At both positions 27 and 74 it is apparent that lysine is much more stimulatory than arginine, indicating that phosphotransferase interacts best with lysines while having some affinity for arginines. These findings confirm results obtained with cathepsin D where a lysine at position 203 is much more potent than an arginine at that position in stimulating oligosaccharide phosphorylation (5Baranski T.J. Koelsch G. Hartsuck J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23365-23372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When all the lysine mutagenesis data is considered together, it is apparent that lysines at four positions (27, 50, 74, and 124) determine the level of oligosaccharide phosphorylation between 2.3 and 79.2%. The other lysines, with the exception of Lys-117 (see below), have little or no effect on this process. This is analogous to findings that have been made with several lysosomal hydrolases. In the case of procathepsin L, two lysine residues in the propeptide are required for efficient phosphorylation while mutation of 19 other lysines does not impair this process (10Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Wu Q. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarly, while certain lysine residues of cathepsin D contribute to its phosphorylation (4Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Baranski T.J. Koelsch G. Hartsuck J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2007-2015PubMed Google Scholar). Thus in the case of DNase I, as in acid hydrolases, lysine residues at particular locations are key elements of the phosphotransferase recognition domain (4Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Baranski T.J. Koelsch G. Hartsuck J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Another striking finding was that the R27K substitution selectively stimulated phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn-18 whereas the N74K substitution resulted in phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide at Asn-106. Furthermore, the Asn-18 oligosaccharide primarily acquired a single Man-6-P residue while the Asn-106 mostly acquired two such residues. These results raise two fundamental issues concerning phosphotransferase action. First, how does a lysine residue stimulate phosphorylation at one glycosylation site while having no effect on phosphorylation at another site on the same protein? And second, why is it that the oligosaccharide at Asn-18 only acquires a single phosphate? To answer the first question, it is useful to examine the location of the critical lysines relative to the two Asn-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 3). It is apparent that Lys-27 and Lys-74 are located relatively close to the oligosaccharide whose phosphorylation they affect and a considerable distance from the other oligosaccharide. Therefore an attractive possibility is that phosphotransferase can bind DNase I in two orientations, with Lys-27 and Lys-74 determining which orientation is achieved. When bound in one orientation, phosphotransferase can reach one of the oligosaccharides but not the other, and when bound in the other orientation the opposite would occur. This model suggests that DNase I molecules containing both Lys-27 and Lys-74 will first bind to phosphotransferase in one orientation to allow phosphorylation of the accessible oligosaccharide. The DNase I will then dissociate and undergo rotational and short range translational diffusion in the vicinity of phosphotransferase resulting in rebinding in the alternate orientation. This would be followed by phosphorylation of the other oligosaccharide. These results, together with our previous findings with cathepsin D, point out the complexity of the phosphotransferase recognition domain. It is possible, however, that in some proteins, such as cathepsin L, the phosphotransferase recognition element may be a simpler structure (10Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Wu Q. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In a previous study we demonstrated that while there is considerable flexibility in the placement of glycosylation sites on cathepsin D in terms of the ability of oligosaccharides to be phosphorylated by phosphotransferase, oligosaccharides located closer to the protein recognition domain were preferentially phosphorylated (7Cantor A.B. Baranski T.J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23357-23363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that DNase I may represent the extreme example of this process and to test this we plan to move the glycosylation sites to different regions on the DNase I molecule and determine how far phosphotransferase can “reach” when it interacts with either Lys-27 or Lys-74. We predict that phosphotransferase will only be able to phosphorylate oligosaccharides in the general region of the critical lysine. The reason why the oligosaccharide at position 18 only acquires a single Man-6-P residue is unclear at this time. Lazzarino and Gabel (25Lazzarino D. Gabel C. EMBO J. 1989; 3: 5015-5023Google Scholar) showed that the terminal mannose on the α1,6-branch of the core β-linked mannose of the high mannose oligosaccharide must be removed in order for the penultimate mannose to be phosphorylated (the first phosphate is usually transferred to a mannose on the α1,3-branch of the oligosaccharide) (25Lazzarino D. Gabel C. EMBO J. 1989; 3: 5015-5023Google Scholar). Thus one possibility is that the terminal mannose residue on the α1,6-branch is not removed on the oligosaccharide at Asn-18, thereby preventing the acquisition of the second Man-6-P residue. Alternatively, the oligosaccharide at Asn-18 may be oriented relative to the phosphotransferase-binding site in such a way that only one arm of the high mannose unit can enter the catalytic site of phosphotransferase. It is of interest that a similar phenomenon occurs on cathepsin D where the oligosaccharide at position 70 only receives one phosphate while the oligosaccharide at position 199 usually receives two phosphates (7Cantor A.B. Baranski T.J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dustin M.L. Baranski T.J. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Dittmer F. Pohlmann R. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 852-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An unexpected result was that replacement of lysine at position 117 with an alanine caused a 2–3-fold stimulation of phosphorylation at both glycosylation sites. This indicates that a lysine residue at this particular location actually impairs phosphorylation, perhaps by serving as a binding site for phosphotransferase and orienting the enzyme in a manner that is unfavorable for phosphorylation of the existing oligosaccharides. Regardless of the explanation, this finding raises the possibility of “inhibitory” amino acids that function to prevent phosphorylation. Since mouse DNase I, which contains both Lys-27 and Lys-74, is phosphorylated only slightly better than bovine DNase I when expressed in COS-1 cells, 2A. Nishikawa, W. Gregory, J. Frenz, and S. Kornfeld, unpublished results. it seems likely that this protein contains inhibitory residues in addition to Lys-117. It may turn out that there are a number of mechanisms for preventing phosphotransferase from acting on secretory glycoproteins that otherwise might express functional binding sites for this enzyme. In summary, the productive interaction of bovine DNase I with phosphotransferase requires critical lysine and arginine residues at specific locations on the surface of the protein, similar to the case of authentic lysosomal hydrolases. However, bovine DNase I is a relatively weak substrate for phosphotransferase and consequently the oligosaccharides in the majority of the molecules are not phosphorylated. Therefore most of the newly synthesized DNase I is secreted rather than being diverted to lysosomes. This process is enhanced further in the pancreas where the potential glycosylation site at Asn-106 is not utilized."

It is modulated by α-isopropylmalate, an intermediate in leucine biosynthesis. In the presence of α-isopropylmalate, Leu3p is a transcriptional activator. In the absence of the signal molecule, the activation domain is masked, and Leu3p acts as a repressor. The recent discovery that Leu3p retains its regulatory properties when expressed in mammalian cells (Guo, H., and Kohlhaw, G. B.

Here we present experimental support for this notion and address the mechanism of masking. We show that modulation of Leu3p is exceedingly sensitive to mutations in the activation domain.

Using separately expressed segments containing either the DNA binding domain-middle region or the activation domain of wild type Leu3p (or Leu3-dd) in a modified yeast two-hybrid system, we provide direct evidence for α-isopropylmalate-dependent interaction between these segments. Finally, we use the phenotype of Leu3-dd-containing cells (slow growth in the absence of added leucine) to select for suppressor mutations that map to the middle region of Leu3-dd.

The Leu3 protein of yeast belongs to a class of transcriptional regulators whose members are characterized by a Zn(II)2-Cys6 binuclear cluster in their DNA binding domains (1Marmorstein R. Carey M.

Well studied examples of modulation include Gal4p, which is activated (“unmasked”) by galactose in a process that involves changes in the interaction between Gal4p and an auxiliary protein known as Gal80p (3Leuther K.K.

Leu3p is modulated by α-IPM,1 an intermediate in leucine biosynthesis (7Hampsey D.M. Lewin A.S. Kohlhaw G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Leu3p binds to UASL elements in the promoters of genes involved in the biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids (8Friden P. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2690-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The finding that the GDH1 gene is regulated by Leu3p and α-IPM (10Hu Y. Cooper T.G. Kohlhaw G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) led to the hypothesis that α-IPM serves as a signal molecule that communicates the status of amino acid biosynthetic activity (as represented by the leucine pathway) to more central points of nitrogen metabolism. It is of interest in this context that theLEU3 gene itself is controlled by Gcn4p (11Zhou K. Brisco P.R.G. Hinkkanen A.E. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5261-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Leu3p binds to target DNA irrespective of the presence or absence of α-IPM (9Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of α-IPM, Leu3p represses gene expression below the basal level seen in leu3 null cells (9Brisco P.R.G.

Science. 1992; 258: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the presence of α-IPM, it causes strong activation. The zinc cluster part of Leu3p's DNA binding domain is located between amino acids 37 and 67 of the 886-residue protein (11Zhou K. Brisco P.R.G. Hinkkanen A.E. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5261-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Bai Y. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5991-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Sze J.-Y. Remboutsika E. Kohlhaw G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5702-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and a putative dimerization domain is found between amino acids 85 and 99 (14Sze J.-Y. Remboutsika E. Kohlhaw G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5702-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A region responsible for transcriptional activation has been identified within the C-terminal 30 amino acids of Leu3p (14Sze J.-Y. Remboutsika E. Kohlhaw G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5702-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17409-17412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncated Leu3p molecules lacking the AD still bind to DNA. They are totally devoid of activation potential and act as repressors (9Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17409-17412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhou K. Bai Y. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Deleting as many as 600 amino acids from the middle of Leu3p leaves DNA binding and transcriptional activation functions intact but eliminates modulation (16Zhou K. Bai Y. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Friden P. Reynolds C. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Such molecules have a constitutively high activation potential that usually exceeds that of modulated forms of Leu3p. The implication of these results is that Leu3p's middle region contains information that is essential for modulation. In dealing with the question of modulation, it may be helpful to break the modulation process down into discrete steps, e.g. the binding of the modulator α-IPM, conformational changes caused by the binding of α-IPM, and the eventual exposure of the AD that allows it to interact with components of the transcription apparatus. Our current view is that the unmasking of the AD as well as its masking in the absence of α-IPM occur without the participation of auxiliary proteins. The strongest support for this notion comes from recent observations made when full-length yeast Leu3p was expressed in mammalian cells (18Guo H. Kohlhaw G.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was found that the behavior of Leu3p in mouse cells was almost indistinguishable from that seen in its native environment; Leu3p was stable but inactive when α-IPM was absent and caused an apparent severalfold repression of reporter gene expression. When α-IPM was present in the cell culture medium, Leu3p was converted into a strong activator. Since mammalian cells do not synthesize branched chain amino acids, it appeared highly unlikely that they would elaborate Leu3p-specific factors for masking, unmasking, or α-IPM interaction. In this study, we have used biochemical and molecular genetic approaches to advance our understanding of the modulation process. We show that modulation is exquisitely sensitive to mutational changes in the AD of Leu3p. Using wild type Leu3p and a mutant form with drastically intensified masking, we show that the AD and the remainder of Leu3p interact and that this interaction depends on α-IPM. Isolation of intragenic suppressors of the slow growth phenotype of the masking mutant shows the usefulness of this approach for identifying regions or individual residues of Leu3p that are involved in masking. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used were DBY746 (MATα leu2-3leu2-112 trp1-289 ura3-52his3-Δ1; YGSC), DK1 (MATα leu3-Δ::LEU2 leu2-3 leu2-112trp1-289 ura3-52 his3Δ1; see below), and XK157-3C (MATα leu3-Δ2::HIS3 trp1-289 ura3-52 his3-Δ1; (16Zhou K. Bai Y. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). The latter two contain total leu3 deletions. DK1 was constructed as follows. Yeast shuttle vector pRS305 (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested withScaI and BsaI. A fragment containing theLEU2 gene was recovered and inserted into plasmid pGB12 (9Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that had been cut with BamHI and rendered blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase. The resulting plasmid, pDW1, contained one copy of the LEU2 gene flanked by 5′- and 3′-noncoding sequences ofLEU3. The orientation of LEU2 was the same as the original orientation of LEU3 at this locus. Plasmid pDW1 was digested to completion with SphI and SacI. Among the fragments generated was a 4.3-kbp fragment containing theLEU2 gene and LEU3-flanking sequences. The digestion mixture was used for integrative transformation of strain DBY746, selecting for Leu±. (Since the desired transformants carried an intact LEU2 gene, but noLEU3 gene, the phenotype was expected to change from Leu− (DBY746, no growth in the absence of added leucine) to Leu± (slow growth, about 40% that of wild type cells, Ref. 9Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) Transformants that also had the His−, Ura−, and Trp− phenotype were collected and designated DK1. Their genotype was further confirmed by PCR using purified yeast chromosomal DNA and primers complementary to theLEU2 coding region and regions of the LEU3 locus flanking the LEU2 gene. Unless stated otherwise, yeast cells were grown on SD medium (20Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 59-78Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar) supplemented with the required nutrients. A supplement of 2 mm leucine plus 1 mm each of valine and isoleucine was routinely used to generate low intracellular α-IPM levels. (The presence of valine was found not to be obligatory, and valine was therefore omitted in some experiments.) High α-IPM levels were generated by supplementing the medium with 0.2 mm leucine. Cells were grown at 30 °C and harvested at an A 600 of about 1. Escherichia coli strains used for DNA manipulations were TG1 (K12 [Δlac-pro] supE hsdΔS/F′traΔ36proA + B + lacI q lacZM15), DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.), and XL-2blue (Stratagene). Strain CJ236 (dut1 ung1 thi-1 relA1/pCJ105[CMr]) was used for isolation of uracil-containing single-stranded DNA. E. colicells were grown at 37 °C in L broth or 2 × YT media with the addition of 100 μg/ml penicillin where needed. The majority of the mutants was generated by degenerate oligonucleotide incorporation. This approach required the construction of an expression plasmid containing a LEU3 gene with engineered restriction sites that would allow precise cassette exchange of the AD. To achieve this, newNgoMI and PmeI/SmaI sites were created by site-directed mutagenesis. E. coli CJ236 cells were transformed with plasmid pRS316-LEU3 which was constructed by cloning aLEU3-containing fragment into pRS316 (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (The fragment extended from −561 to about +4700 relative to the A at the beginning of the open reading frame of LEU3 (11Zhou K. Brisco P.R.G. Hinkkanen A.E. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5261-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).) Transformed cells were grown to mid-log phase and superinfected with helper phage M13K07 in the presence of uracil. Phage particles were collected and single-stranded DNA isolated according to a protocol from Bio-Rad. Equimolar amounts of two phosphorylated primers (5′ CATCATGGCCGGCTGGGATAAC-3′ for the 5′ side of the AD and 5′-CCCAAGGTTTAAACCCGGGTTCTTTTTTTGCG-3′ for the 3′ side of the AD (NgoI and PmeI/SmaI sites underlined)) were then used to mutagenize pRS316-LEU3. Note that changes made to generate the new restriction sites did not alter the amino acid sequence of Leu3p. Potential mutants were screened for the presence of an additional SmaI site, and positives were sequenced using a double-stranded DNA cycle sequencing kit from Life Technologies, Inc. A 1-kbp fragment of DNA containing newNgoMI and PmeI sites was amplified by PCR using appropriate primers. A BlnI-SmaI piece was excised from the fragment and cloned intoBlnI/SmaI-digested pPC62H/86T-LEU3 from which two existing NgoM1 sites had been removed, resulting in plasmid pYHA. It contains unique NgoMI and PmeI sites that define the AD of the Leu-3 protein. Its LEU3 gene is flanked by ADC1 promoter and terminator sequences, respectively. Plasmid pPC62H/86T-LEU3 had been constructed from centromere-containing plasmid pPC62H/86T (a gift from E. Taparowsky, Purdue University) and pT7-LEU3 (a gift from J.-Y. Sze of this laboratory). pT7-LEU3 was digested with PstI andSmaI, and the 3.1-kbp, LEU3-containing fragment was inserted into pPC62H/86T that had also been cut withPstI and SmaI. To mutagenize the AD of Leu3p, a 93-base pair oligonucleotide, 5′-ATGGCCGGCtgggataactgggaatctgatatggtttggagggatgttgatattttaatgaatgaatttgcgttcaatcccaaGGTTTAAACC-3′ (NgoMI and PmeI sites underlined) was synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) such that the misincorporation rate at the positions shown in lowercase letters was 4.5% (i.e. the proportion of each of the three non-native nucleotides was 1.5%) or, in a separate experiment, 2.7% (the proportion of each of the three non-native nucleotides was 0.9%). The lowercase letters correspond to amino acid positions 861–885 of Leu3p (11Zhou K. Brisco P.R.G. Hinkkanen A.E. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5261-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide mixture was incubated, heated to 85 °C, then cooled to 4 °C over a 1-h period. Nucleotides and Klenow enzyme were added to the annealed mixture which was then incubated on ice for 5 min, at 23 °C for 5 min, and at 37 °C for 20–30 min. The extended and now double-stranded DNA was digested with NgoMI and PmeI. The final product was a mixture of monomeric DNA fragments. These were ligated into plasmid pYHA that had been digested with NgoMI and PmeI. The molar ratio of fragment to plasmid was approximately 3. Aliquots of 10 ng of ligation mixture DNA were used to transform E. coli DH5α cells. DNA was purified from 4 ml of overnight cultures using a QIAprep spin column. Sequencing was done by the double-stranded DNA cycle sequencing procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) using a [33P]ATP-end-labeled primer (5′-CCCGTTACAACTACAATC-3′). pYHA plasmids carrying mutations in theNgoMI-PmeI region of LEU3 were used to transform yeast strain XK157-3C/pYB1 (leu3 null; pYB1 contains a LEU2′-lacZ reporter gene (9Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Yeast cells were transformed either with the help of a transformation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) or by the lithium acetate procedure (21Ito H. Fukaka Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were plated on SD medium (20Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 59-78Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Single colonies were suspended in 10 ml of SD medium supplemented with 2 mmleucine plus 1 mm isoleucine and grown at 30 °C for 24–30 h. Aliquots of the subcultures were then inoculated into 10 ml of SD medium supplemented with either 0.2 mm leucine (for high intracellular concentrations of α-IPM) or 2 mmleucine plus 1 mm isoleucine (for low α-IPM concentrations). To determine reporter gene activity, harvested cells were resuspended in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Aliquots of the suspension (made up to a total volume of 1 ml) were mixed with 20 μl of a 0.1% solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate and 50 μl of chloroform and vortexed vigorously for 15 s. The β-galactosidase activity was then measured following the procedure of Miller (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Several mutations in the AD of Leu3p were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, as described (15Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17409-17412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhou, K. (1991) A Molecular Switch: Structure-Function Study of Yeast Regulatory Protein Leu3. Ph.D. thesis, Purdue University.Google Scholar). The two sets of data,i.e. those obtained by the degenerate oligonucleotide method and those obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, were normalized with respect to the wild type controls. Following the procedure of Kunkel et al. (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar), uracil-containing single-stranded DNA from pRS316-LEU3 was mutagenized using an oligonucleotide (5′-GTTTGGAGGAACGTTAATATTTTAATG-3′) that contained AAC and AAT triplets in place of the native GATs. Plasmid DNA isolated from several E. coli colonies was then used to transform aleu3 null strain (XK157-3C). Colonies growing slowly on leucine− plates were identified, and the original plasmid preparations were sequenced. There was excellent correlation between slow growth and the D872N/D874N double mutation. Plasmids of this type were designated pRS316-LEU3dd.To transfer the LEU3dd DNA to a plasmid with a different marker and to place the gene behind theADC1 promoter, a cassette exchange was performed between pRS316-LEU3dd and pPC62H/86T-LEU3, as follows: pRS316-LEU3dd was used as template for a PCR reaction to synthesize a DNA fragment extending from the SalI site to the end of the LEU3 gene. The PCR primers were 5′-CCAACAGAAGACATACGGA-3′ (for the 5′ end of the fragment) and 5′-GTAGCACCGCGGTCATTACATA AC-3′ (for the 3′ end of the fragment; KspI restriction site underlined). The PCR product was digested with SalI and KspI and then inserted into pPC62H/86T-LEU3 cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was designated pPC62H/86T-LEU3dd. A derivative encoding a Leu3-dd protein from which residues 174–773 were deleted was created by digesting pPC62H/86T-LEU3dd with SalI andAvrII, followed by Klenow enzyme treatment and re-ligation. It was designated pPC62H/86T-LEU3ddΔ12. The DNA binding part of the two-hybrid system was designed to contain the extended DNA binding region of Leu3p (DB, residues 1–173) and the adjacent “middle region” (MR, residues 174–773). It was expressed behind theADC1 promoter. An appropriate centromere-containing plasmid was constructed by digesting pPC62H/86T-LEU3 (see above) withAvrII, filling in the overhangs with T4 DNA polymerase, and re-closing the plasmid with T4 DNA ligase. This created an in-frame stop codon at amino acid position 775 of Leu3p and replaced the arginine at position 774 with a serine. The resulting plasmid was designated pPC62H/86T-DB-MR. The activation domain constructs for use in the two-hybrid system were also expressed behind the ADC1 promoter. Plasmid pNLVP16 (a gift from E. Taparowsky, Purdue University) served as starting material for pVP-LEU3-WT-AD. A pair of primers was used to clone, by PCR, a fragment encoding the AD of VP16. The primers 5′-CTGAGCTATTCCTGCAGTAGTGAAGAG-3′ (5′ end primer) and 5′TCGACGGATC GACCTAGGACCCGGGGAA-3′ (3′ end primer) were designed to contain a PstI site and an AvrII site, respectively (underlined). The PCR product was digested withPstI and AvrII and then ligated into plasmid pPC62H/86T-LEU3 that had also been cut with PstI andAvrII, thus fusing the VP16 AD sequence to the N terminus of and in-frame with the extended Leu3p AD sequence (residues 774–886). This yielded pPC62H/86T-VP-LEU3-WT-AD. To transfer the VP-LEU3-WT-AD sequence to plasmid pRS423 (multicopy, different marker; ref. 25Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), pPC62H/86T-VP-LEU3-WT-AD was digested with ApaI andPvuII. A 3-kbp ApaI-PvuII fragment containing the VP-LEU3-WT-AD sequence was ligated into pRS423 that had been cut with ApaI and SmaI. The resulting plasmid was designated pVP-LEU3-WT-AD. Plasmid pVP-LEU3-dd-AD was constructed in the same way except that pPC62H/86T-LEU3-dd (see above) was used instead of pPC62H/86T-LEU3. To construct pVP, a plasmid coding for the VP16 AD only, the above PCR product was first digested withAvrII, filled in with T4 DNA polymerase, then digested withPstI. The digested PCR product was inserted into plasmid pPC62H/86T-LEU3 that had been cut with SpeI, filled in, and then cut with PstI. The resulting plasmid, pPC62H/86T-VP, contained an in-frame stop codon behind the VP16 AD sequence. Next, the VP sequence was transferred to pRS423 in the way described above, yielding pVP. The DNA sequence of all junction regions and of the entire PCR-synthesized region of the VP16 AD was confirmed using the Sequenase™ version 2.0 sequencing kit from Amersham Corp. Transformation of yeast cells was performed by the lithium acetate method (21Ito H. Fukaka Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recipient strain DK1 was transformed first with the reporter plasmid pYB1 (9Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then with pPC62H/86T-DB-MR. The resulting doubly-transformed strain was then further transformed with either pRS423 (control), or pVP, or pVP-LEU3-WT-AD, or pVP-LEU3-dd-AD. The transformants were purified and single colonies from different isolates were used to inoculate 2 ml of SD medium supplemented with 1 mm each of leucine, valine, and isoleucine. After the pre-cultures had grown to saturation, cells that originated from the same colony were used to inoculate 10 ml of SD medium supplemented with either 0.2 mm leucine (if high intracellular concentrations of α-IPM were desired) or 4 mm leucine and 2 mm each of valine and isoleucine (if low α-IPM concentrations were desired). Preparation of cell-free extracts and determination of β-galactosidase activity were done as described above (see “Mutagenesis of the AD of Leu3p”). To facilitate the identification of mutants (suppressors of the Leu3-dd phenotype), the MR (encompassing residues 172–772) was divided into three subregions defined by naturally existing restriction sites. The first subregion (SubRI) extended from the SalI to theSpeI site (corresponding to residues 172–469); the second subregion (SubRII) from the SpeI to the NdeI site (residues 470–607); the third subregion (SubRIII) from theNdeI to the AvrII site (residues 608–772). The subregions were subjected to mutagenic PCR (26Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods & Applications. 1994; 3: S136-S140Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) separately. The pairs of primers used for SubRI, SubRII, and SubRIII, respectively, were 5′-CCAACAGAAGACATACGGA-3′ plus 5′-TTTCCAGCACTTTGGGAGG-3′, 5′-AAGTCAATTGGAGATTAGTC-3′ plus 5′-TACCTCCACCTTCCTTTTG-3′, and 5′-GACGTTTAATGCCTCAGTT-3′ plus 5′-GTGTCCTTGATGTCTGTAG-3′. The PCR products (pools of mutated DNA fragments) were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into pPC62H/86T-LEU3dd that had been cut with either SalI and SpeI (SubRI), or SpeI and NdeI (SubRII), orNdeI and AvrII (SubRIII). Thus, any one Leu3p molecule contained only one mutated subregion at most. XK157-3C/pYB1 cells (leu3 null with the LEU2′-′lacZreporter) were transformed with ligation solutions containing either SubRI, SubRII, or SubRIII mutants. The transformed cells were plated on SD medium (20Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 59-78Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and selected for significantly increased growth rates. Cell-free extracts were prepared and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described above (“Mutagenesis of the AD of Leu3p”). Mutants with elevated β-galactosidase activities were isolated, and the appropriate subregion was subjected to DNA sequence analysis. To determine the phenotype of the MR mutants in the context of a Leu3p molecule with a wild type AD, wild type subregions were replaced with the corresponding mutated subregions by cassette exchange. For example, mutated SubRII's were isolated by cutting mutated pPC62H/86T-LEU3dd molecules with SpeI and NdeI and inserting theSpeI-NdeI fragments into pPC62H/86T-LEU3 that had been cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids contained a mutated SubRII in an otherwise wild type LEU3 gene. Whole-cell extracts used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western blots were prepared using the glass bead method (27Dunn, B., and Wobbe, C. R. (1993) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K., eds) Vol. 2, Unit 13.13, Wiley Interscience, New York.Google Scholar). Specifically, cells from 10 ml cultures were harvested at anA 600 of about 1, washed once, resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.4 m [NH4]2SO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μmZnSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μm pepstatin), and transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. About 150 μl of treated glass beads were added to the suspension, and the tube was kept on ice. It was vortexed for 30 s and then left on ice for at least 1 min. The procedure was repeated six times. The mixture was then centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf table top centrifuge, 14,000 rpm). The supernatant solution was stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, whole-cell extract was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.9, containing 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 40 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1.4 ng of32P-5′ end-labeled UASLEU-30-mer DNA (9Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 280 ng of non-labeled, non-binding UASLEU-24-mer DNA (9Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a total volume of 40 μl. The solution was then applied to a pre-electrophoresed 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed for 2.5 h at 30 mA in buffer consisting of 90 mm Tris base, 90 mmH3BO3, and 2 mm EDTA. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Western blotting was performed on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. For immunoblotting, the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersh"
https://openalex.org/W2019959686,"The “ball and chain” model has been shown to be suitable for explaining the rapid inactivation of voltage-dependent K+ channels. For theDrosophila Shaker K+ channel (ShB), the first 20 residues of the amino terminus have been identified as the inactivation ball that binds to the open channel pore and blocks ion flow (Hoshi, T., Zagotta, W. N., and Aldrich, R. W. (1990)Science 250, 533–538; Zagotta, W. N., Hoshi, T., and Aldrich, R. W. (1990) Science 250, 568–571). We studied the structural elements responsible for rapid inactivation of a mammalian transient type K+ channel (rat Kv1.4) by constructing various mutants in the amino terminus and expressing them in Xenopus oocytes. Although it has been reported that the initial 37 residues might form the inactivation ball for rat Kv1.4 (Tseng-Crank, J., Yao, J.-A., Berman M. F., and Tseng, G.-N. (1993) J. Gen. Physiol. 102, 1057–1083), we found that not only the initial 37 residues, but also the following region, residues 40–68, could function independently as an inactivation gate. Like the Shaker inactivation ball, both potential inactivation domains have a hydrophobic amino-terminal region and a hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal region having net positive charge, which is essential for the domains to function as an inactivation gate. The “ball and chain” model has been shown to be suitable for explaining the rapid inactivation of voltage-dependent K+ channels. For theDrosophila Shaker K+ channel (ShB), the first 20 residues of the amino terminus have been identified as the inactivation ball that binds to the open channel pore and blocks ion flow (Hoshi, T., Zagotta, W. N., and Aldrich, R. W. (1990)Science 250, 533–538; Zagotta, W. N., Hoshi, T., and Aldrich, R. W. (1990) Science 250, 568–571). We studied the structural elements responsible for rapid inactivation of a mammalian transient type K+ channel (rat Kv1.4) by constructing various mutants in the amino terminus and expressing them in Xenopus oocytes. Although it has been reported that the initial 37 residues might form the inactivation ball for rat Kv1.4 (Tseng-Crank, J., Yao, J.-A., Berman M. F., and Tseng, G.-N. (1993) J. Gen. Physiol. 102, 1057–1083), we found that not only the initial 37 residues, but also the following region, residues 40–68, could function independently as an inactivation gate. Like the Shaker inactivation ball, both potential inactivation domains have a hydrophobic amino-terminal region and a hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal region having net positive charge, which is essential for the domains to function as an inactivation gate. Aldrich and co-workers have shown that a “ball and chain” model, originally proposed for Na+ channel inactivation (4Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), can also explain the rapid inactivation of a Drosophila Shaker K+ channel (1Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 2Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain (ball) tethered by the adjacent region (chain) to the channel protein binds to the channel pore after channel activation and blocks ion flow. In the Shaker K+ channel (ShB), the initial 20 amino acids have been identified as the inactivation ball. The following region preceding the assembly domain (5Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) has been identified as the chain tethering the ball to the channel (1Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The 20-amino acid inactivation ball is composed of the 11 amino-terminal hydrophobic residues and the following 9 hydrophilic residues containing net positive charge. Both the hydrophobic stretch and the charged region are thought to be involved in the binding of the ball to its receptor via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. In contrast, in mammalian transient type K+ channels, the ball and chain structure had not been well defined, although it had been shown that deletion of various lengths from the amino-terminal region of Kv1.4 disrupted rapid inactivation suggesting the presence of a “ball” structure (6Rettig J.

Morales M.J. Zhang Y. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1383-H1395PubMed Google Scholar). Tseng and co-workers (3Tseng-Crank J. Yao J.-A. Berman M.F. Tseng G.-N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1057-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have studied this issue in more detail by deleting different domains in the amino-terminal region of rat Kv1.4. They have not identified “chain” structure but have shown that deletion of the amino-terminal hydrophobic domain, residues 3–25, resulted in loss of rapid inactivation. Deletion of the following hydrophilic region containing five positive and two negative charges, residues 26–37, greatly attenuated inactivation. Based on these and other findings, they suggested that the amino terminus of rat Kv1.4 might be similar to that of ShB in having one inactivation ball, which is composed of the initial 37 residues. In the present study, we investigated the structural elements responsible for rapid inactivation of rat Kv1.4 and have identified another domain that can produce rapid inactivation independently of the proposed inactivation ball. Fig. 1 shows the amino-terminal sequences of Kv1.4 and the mutants investigated in this study. Eleven deletion mutants and one addition mutant were made in the amino-terminal region of Kv1.4. In addition, one mutant in which amino acid residues 40–68 of Kv1.4 were inverted in Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 was constructed. Fragments for all the mutants except the one with inverted residues were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s). The 20–22-base pair sense primers used for generating Δ2–25, Δ2–26, Δ2–28, Δ2–30, Δ2–32, Δ2–39, and Δ2–61 corresponded to the appropriate region in Kv1.4 and contained an ApaI site, unique within the multiple cloning site of the vector pBluescript II, and an ATG at the 5′-end. The antisense primer (AS1) complementary to nucleotides (nt) 532–551 of Kv1.4 was used for the above seven mutants. The sense primer used for generating Δ29–162 corresponded to nucleotides 487–506 of Kv1.4 and contained a XhoI site (which is unique in Kv1.4 at nt 80) at the 5′-end; the antisense primer was AS1. For constructing Δ2–39 & Δ69–162, the sense primer (S1), with an ApaI site at the 5′-terminus and corresponding to nucleotides −35 to −16 of Kv1.4, was used with an antisense primer complementary to nucleotides 180–199 with a XhoI site at its 5′-end. To generate Δ38–162 and Δ2–39 & Δ61–162, two fragments, amplified by PCR, were ligated into the mutants. The upstream fragment for each mutant was designated fragment I; the downstream fragment was fragment II. Fragment II for both mutants was the same and corresponded to amino acid residues 163–185 of Kv1.4. The sense primer for fragment I of Δ38–162 was S1, and that of Δ2–39 & Δ61–162 was the same one used for Δ2–39. The antisense primer for the fragment I contained a StuI site at the 5′-end and corresponded to nucleotides 96–114 for Δ38–162 and to nucleotides 161–181 for Δ2–39 & Δ61–162. The sense primer for fragment II corresponded to nucleotides 490–508 and contained a SmaI site at the 5′-end; the antisense primer was AS1. Amino acid residues 26–39 of Kv1.4 were added to the amino terminus of Kv1.4 in the addition mutant. To make the addition mutant, two fragments (fragment I was generated by PCR and fragment II was cut out from Kv1.4) were ligated into the mutant. The sense primer for fragment I of the addition mutant corresponded to nucleotides 76–99 and contained anApaI site and ATG at the 5′-end; the antisense primer was complementary to nucleotides 97–116 and contained a NcoI site at the 5′-end. To make amino acid residues 40–68 (AALAVAAATAAVEGTGGSGGGPHHHHQTR) invert in Δ2–39 & Δ69–162, the sense oligonucleotide that codes for MRTQHHHHPGGGSGGTGEVAATAAAVALAA and the antisense oligonucleotide complementary to it were used. They were designed to produce an ApaI site at the 5′-end and aMluI site at the 3′-end when annealed. The annealed fragment was ligated to Kv1.4, which was digested with ApaI andMluI. In a 100-μl PCR reaction, 100 pmol of each primer, 0.2 μg of template cDNA (Kv1.4 for all the mutants except Δ2–39 & Δ69–162; Δ2–39 for Δ2–39 & Δ69–162), and 5.0 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) were used. Reaction temperatures were varied using a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer): 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 2 min; and 72 °C, 3 min for 25 cycles. The amplified fragment for Δ2–25, Δ2–26, Δ2–28, Δ2–30, Δ2–32, Δ2–39, and Δ2–61 was digested withApaI and MluI and ligated to Kv1.4 between theApaI and MluI sites. The amplified fragment for Δ29–162 was digested with XhoI and MluI and ligated to Kv1.4 between the XhoI and MluI sites. The fragment for Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 was amplified using Δ2–39 as template and digested with ApaI and XhoI. The digested fragment was ligated to Δ29–162, which was digested withApaI and XhoI. The amplified fragment I for Δ2–39 & Δ61–162 and Δ38–162 was digested with ApaI and StuI, and the other fragment (fragment II) was digested with SmaI and MluI. These two fragments were ligated to Kv1.4, which was digested with ApaI andMluI. The amplified fragment I for the addition mutant, which was digested with ApaI and NcoI, fragment II, which was cut out from Kv1.4 with NcoI (at nt −2), andPmaCI (at nt 200) were ligated to Kv1.4 digested withApaI and PmaCI. Sequences of all the fragments generated by PCR in the mutants were verified on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method using an A.L.F. DNA Sequencer II (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Electrophysiological measurements were carried out essentially as reported previously (8Ishii K. Nunoki K. Murakoshi H. Taira N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,9Okada H. Ishii K. Nunoki K. Abe T. Taira N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The pBluescript II vectors containing the constructs were linearized with EcoRI, and cRNAs were prepared from these templates with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). Transcribed RNAs were dissolved in water at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/μl for oocyte injection. The integrity of the cRNA products was checked by running the samples on formaldehyde containing agarose gels (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The injected oocytes were incubated in Barth's medium supplemented with penicillin G (71.5 units/ml) and streptomycin (35.9 μg/ml) at 18 °C for 2–4 days before doing electrophysiological measurements. The K+ currents were recorded by a conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp method with 3 m KCl-filled electrodes as described (8Ishii K. Nunoki K. Murakoshi H. Taira N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Okada H. Ishii K. Nunoki K. Abe T. Taira N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

For the bath solution containing high K+ (20K), Na+was replaced with K+. All electrophysiological measurements were carried out at room temperature (21 ± 1 °C). Current records were low pass-filtered at 3 kHz. All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance was evaluated using Student's paired or unpairedt test. A p value smaller than 0.05 was considered to be significant. Oocytes expressing Kv1.4 and all the mutant channels showed voltage-dependent outward currents upon depolarization (data not shown). They were held at −80 mV and depolarized to test potentials. Fig.2 A (upper panel) shows normalized currents of Δ2–28 and Kv1.4 recorded using a depolarizing pulse to +20 mV for 400 ms. The traces are superimposed to illustrate the differences in their wave forms. The peak current of Kv1.4 and Δ2–28 at +20 mV was 2.05 ± 0.35 μA (n = 7) and 4.96 ± 0.54 μA (n = 5), respectively. The Δ2–28 current showed little decline during the 400-ms test pulse, while the Kv1.4 current inactivated almost completely. τinact of Δ2–28 current was measured using a prolonged depolarization pulse (5000 ms). The τinact was 2090.9 ± 647.9 ms (n = 5), which was about 90 times larger than that of Kv1.4. The inactivation of Δ2–28 seems to be qualitatively different from that of Kv1.4. Since it has been shown for Shaker K+channel and RHK1 (rat Kv1.4) that elevating [K+] o can accelerate the recovery rate (11Demo S.D. Yellen G. Neuron. 1991; 7: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 12Tseng G.-N. Tseng-Crank J. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 657-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of changing [K+] o on the recovery rate. Recovery from inactivation of Δ2–28 at 2 mm[K+] o and 20 mm[K+] o is shown in Fig. 2 A (lower panel). Elevating [K+] o had no effect on the recovery time course (τrec: 3.43 ± 0.31 s at 2 mm [K+] o and 3.06 ± 0.42 s at 20 mm [K+] o (n = 5)). Surprisingly, with further deletion (Δ2–39), rapid inactivation was resumed. Currents of Δ2–39 and Kv1.4 recorded at +20 mV were normalized and superimposed in Fig. 2 B (upper panel). The peak current of Δ2–39 at +20 mV was 0.71 ± 0.18 μA (n = 4). The Δ2–39 current showed rapid inactivation. The τinact of Δ2–39 current was 30.33 ± 2.37 ms (n = 4), which is slightly larger than that of Kv1.4 (Fig. 1). Elevating [K+] o accelerated the recovery from inactivation of Δ2–39 (Fig. 2 B,lower panel). The τrec of Δ2–39 was 72.96 ± 8.25 s at 2 mm[K+] o and 37.15 ± 2.48 s at 20 mm [K+] o (n = 4). With further deletion (Δ2–61), fast inactivation disappeared again (Fig. 2 C, upper panel). The Δ2–61 current showed little decline during a 400-ms test pulse. The peak current of Δ2–61 at +20 mV was 2.01 ± 0.51 μA (n = 6). Inactivation was observed during a prolonged depolarization pulse (5000 ms). The recovery time course of the Δ2–61 current was not affected by elevating [K+] o (Fig. 2 C,lower panel). The τrec was 3.17 ± 0.20 s at 2 mm [K+] o and 3.31 ± 0.82 s at 20 mm[K+] o (n = 6). These results suggested that Kv1.4 might have two potential inactivation balls. Based on these findings, we constructed a deletion mutant that had only the first potential inactivation ball, Δ38–162, and a mutant, Δ2–39 & Δ69–162, which had only the second potential inactivation ball. Fig. 3 (A andB, upper panel), shows the normalized currents from Δ38–162 and Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 superimposed on the Kv1.4 current. The Δ38–162 current showed rapid inactivation. The τinact of Δ38–162 at +20 mV was 38.66 ± 1.46 ms (n = 6), which was slightly larger than that of Kv1.4 (Fig. 1). Elevating [K+] o accelerated the recovery of Δ38–162 (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). The τrec was 3.94 ± 0.32 s at 2 mm[K+] o and 1.53 ± 0.08 s at 20 mm [K+] o (n = 6). The peak current of Δ38–162 at +20 mV was 1.67 ± 0.25 μA (n = 6). Δ2–39 & Δ69–162, with only the second potential inactivation ball, showed more rapid inactivation than Kv1.4 (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). The τinactof Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 at +20 mV was 12.05 ± 1.20 ms (n = 6), which was significantly smaller than that of Kv1.4 (p < 0.05)(Fig. 1). Elevating [K+] o accelerated the recovery of Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). The τrec was 20.83 ± 2.46 s at 2 mm[K+] o and 15.13 ± 1.07 s at 20 mm [K+] o (n = 6). The peak current of Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 at +20 mV was 1.19 ± 0.37 μA (n = 6). Since both potential inactivation balls contain net positive charge in the carboxyl termini, we constructed mutants in which some positive charges were removed to examine the contribution of charge to rapid inactivation. Δ29–162 was constructed to delete one net positive charge (3 arginine and 2 glutamic acid residues) from the first potential inactivation ball. Δ2–39 & Δ61–162 was constructed to delete one positive charge (arginine) from the second potential inactivation ball. Fig.4 A (upper panel) shows the normalized Δ29–162 current superimposed on the Δ38–162 current recorded at +20 mV. The peak current of Δ29–162 at +20 mV was 1.80 ± 0.54 μA (n = 4). Inactivation of the Δ29–162 current was much slower than that of Δ38–162. The τinact of Δ29–162 was 361.09 ± 37.69 ms (n = 4), which is about 9 times larger than that of Δ38–162 (Fig. 1). The τrec of Δ29–162 (1.55 ± 0.16 s at 2 mm [K+] o and 0.63 ± 0.10 s at 20 mm[K+] o) was significantly smaller than that of Δ38–162 (3.94 ± 0.32 s at 2 mm[K+] o and 1.53 ± 0.08 s at 20 mm [K+] o) (p < 0.01). Fig. 4 A (lower panel) shows the effects of elevating [K+] o on the recovery time course of Δ29–162. Currents of Δ2–39 & Δ61–162 and Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 recorded at +20 mV are normalized and superimposed in Fig.4 B (upper panel). The peak current of Δ2–39 & Δ61–162 at +20 mV was 1.41 ± 0.20 μA (n = 7). The τinact of Δ2–39 & Δ61–162 was 59.22 ± 1.77 ms (n = 7), which is 5 times larger than that of Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 (Fig. 1). Recovery from inactivation was much faster in Δ2–39 & Δ61–162 than in Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 (Fig. 1). The τrec of Δ2–39 & Δ61–162 and Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 at 2 mm [K+] o were 2.85 ± 0.31 s and 20.83 ± 2.46 s, respectively, and those at 20 mm [K+] o were 1.74 ± 0.12 s and 15.13 ± 1.07 s, respectively. Fig. 4 B (lower panel) shows the effects of elevating [K+] o on the τrec of Δ2–39 & Δ61–162. When the structures of Δ2–28 and Δ2–39 are compared, they differ by a single net positive charge (3 arginine and 2 glutamic acid residues) at the amino terminus of the second potential inactivation ball. However, the currents of the two channels were completely different (Fig.5 A, upper panel). Therefore, we constructed four other mutants that varied in charge at the amino terminus of the second potential ball, Δ2–32, Δ2–30, Δ2–26, and Δ2–25. The numbers of extra net positive charges are one for Δ2–32 and Δ2–30, two for Δ2–26, and three for Δ2–25. The currents of all these mutants showed little inactivation on the same time scale as Kv1.4 (400 ms) (Fig. 5 A,lower panel) and no significant differences in τinact measured during a test pulse of 5000 ms (data not shown). We also constructed a mutant ((+)Kv1.4) in which residues 26–39 of Kv1.4 containing three net positive charges were added to the amino-terminal end of Kv1.4. Adding positive charges greatly reduced the rate of inactivation (Fig. 5 B, upper panel). The τinact of (+)Kv1.4 was 155.9 ± 15.83 ms (n = 6), which was significantly larger than that of Kv1.4 (23.55 ± 3.48 ms; n = 7; p< 0.01) (Fig. 1). The τrec of (+)Kv1.4 at 2 mm [K+] o (7.10 ± 1.57 s) was significantly larger than that at 20 mm[K+] o (3.41 ± 0.45 s;p < 0.05; n = 6) (Fig. 5 B,lower panel). We constructed a mutant in which the second potential inactivation ball was inverted (Inv(40–68)). The inverted ball has positive charge at the amino terminus and a hydrophobic region at the carboxyl terminus. This mutant showed little inactivation during a 400-ms test pulse to +20 mV, whereas the parent mutant showed rapid inactivation (Fig. 5 C, upper panel). The τinact of Inv(40–68) recorded during a 5000-ms pulse was 2616.3 ± 252.8 ms (n = 5). Inverting the second potential ball resulted in the loss of rapid inactivation. There were no differences in τrec of the mutant between 2 mm [K+] o (4.74 ± 0.16 s) and 20 mm [K+] o (4.88 ± 0.48 s; n = 5) (Fig. 5 C, lower panel). We found that there are two potential inactivation balls in the amino-terminal region of rat Kv1.4. Deletion of amino acids 2–28 resulted in loss of rapid inactivation. This is consistent with the finding of Tseng and co-workers (3Tseng-Crank J. Yao J.-A. Berman M.F. Tseng G.-N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1057-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), who found that deletion of residues 3–25 disrupted rapid inactivation. Surprisingly, deletion of 11 more residues resulted in reappearance of rapid inactivation even though the Δ2–39 mutant did not have the core hydrophobic region of the inactivation ball. With further deletion of residues 40–61, rapid inactivation disappeared again. It seems probable that besides the inactivation ball proposed by Tseng and co-workers (the initial 37 residues), there exists a second potential inactivation ball having residues 40–61 as an essential domain. To confirm the presence of two potential balls, we made deletion mutants that had only one potential ball and lacked most of the amino-terminal region preceding the assembly domain (Δ38–162 and Δ2–39 & Δ69–162). As expected, the currents of both the mutants showed rapid inactivation, which indicated that the two potential ball, residues 2–37 and residues 40–68, respectively, could produce rapid inactivation independently. Comparison of Δ38–162 and Δ2–39 & Δ69–162, both of which lack most of the possible chain region, gave some information about the characteristic differences between the first and the second ball. In the case of the second ball (in Δ2–39 & Δ69–162), inactivation was more rapid and the recovery from inactivation was slower than in the case of the first ball (in Δ38–162) (Figs. 1 and 3). This suggests that the second ball may have a higher affinity for the receptor than the first ball. Compared with Kv1.4, binding between the ball and the receptor seems to be much stronger for the second ball than for the ball in wild type Kv1.4, as Δ2–39 currents recover significantly more slowly than Kv1.4 currents (Fig. 1). Among the mutants investigated, the ones that have the second ball recovered from inactivation most slowly (Δ2–39 and Δ2–39 & Δ69–162). The recovery rates of their currents were significantly slower than those of the other mutants. The Δ2–39 & Δ69–162 currents recovered faster than Δ2–39 currents, probably reflecting the influence of the chain region on binding of the ball to the receptor. The presence of residues 69–162 caused slowing of the recovery from inactivation of the Δ2–39 current. Similar to the structure of ShB inactivation ball, the two potential balls in Kv1.4 have an amino-terminal hydrophobic region and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic region containing net positive charge, which is thought to be involved in the binding of the inactivation particle to its receptor via electrostatic interactions (2Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 13Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 949-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Toro L. Ottolia M. Stefani E. Latorre R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7220-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated the contribution of positive charge. Deletion of positive charge from either ball greatly attenuated the inactivation rates and accelerated the recovery rates, which probably reflects the higher affinity of the ball to the receptor site with the carboxyl-terminal positive charge. This result clearly indicates that the positive charge at carboxyl-terminal region of the ball plays an important role. The structural requirements for the inactivation ball were further studied by deleting or adding positive charges in the amino-terminal region of Kv1.4 and by inverting the amino acid sequence of the potential inactivation ball. Since the structure of non-inactivating Δ2–28 was just like having net positive charge (3 arginine and 2 glutamic acid residues) at the amino terminus of the second potential ball of rapidly inactivating Δ2–39, the mutants with different numbers of charges were constructed (Δ2–32, Δ2–30, Δ2–26 and Δ2–25). The currents through these mutants hardly inactivated (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). These results suggest that one extra positive charge at the amino terminus of the second inactivation ball is enough to disrupt its function. Therefore, the influences of net positive charges at the amino terminus of the inactivation ball of Kv1.4 were studied by adding residues 26–39 (three net positive charges) at the amino-terminal end of Kv1.4 ((+)Kv1.4). The currents through (+)Kv1.4 inactivated but the rate of inactivation was significantly slower than for wild type Kv1.4 (Fig.5 B). These results indicate that net positive charge at the amino-terminal end of the inactivation ball of wild type Kv1.4 has a profound effect on function. Together the results indicate the structural requirements of the inactivation ball(s) are an amino-terminal hydrophobic region and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic region containing net positive charge. In agreement with the results of Tseng and co-workers, changing [K+] o had no effects on the recovery rate for our mutants, which did not show rapid inactivation. Elevating [K+] o accelerated the recovery rate in mutants with rapid inactivation, which might reflect repulsion of the inactivation ball by K+ ions (11Demo S.D. Yellen G. Neuron. 1991; 7: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The most striking finding in the present study is that there exist two potential inactivation balls in the amino terminus of rat Kv1.4. It is not known how two inactivation balls could work in wild type Kv1.4. One of the two potential domains might function as the inactivation gate, or one inactivation gate might be composed of both domains. Alternatively, the redundancy of inactivation balls might be a safety device to ensure inactivation. The synthetic ShB inactivation ball peptide has been reported to block several types of K+channels and also cyclic nucleotide gated channels (15Dubinsky W.P. Mayorga-Wark O. Shultz S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1770-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Foster C.D. Chung S. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Levitan I.B.

It will be of interest to synthesize the peptides corresponding to the first domain, the second domain and both the domains of Kv1.4, and to compare their effects on currents of the non-inactivating mutant of Kv1.4 and the other channels. Synthetic peptides could give useful information about how the two domains contribute to form the inactivation ball in wild type Kv1.4. Recently, NMR structures of the inactivation peptides of Kv3.4 (the initial 30 residues) and Kv1.4 (the initial 37 residues) have been reported. The inactivation peptides have a similar characteristic surface charge pattern with a positively charged, a hydrophobic, and a negatively charged region (20Antz C. Geyer M. Fakler B. Schott M.K. Guy H.R. Frank R. Ruppersberg J.P. Kalbitzer H.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The inactivation peptide of Kv1.4 whose NMR structure was determined corresponds to our first inactivation ball. It will be of interest to determine the NMR structure of the second domain and both the domains in the amino-terminal region of Kv1.4. We thank Dr. Kazuo Nunoki for review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1977439713,"Previous studies have demonstrated that diferric transferrin and apotransferrin compete for the binding to basolateral transferrin receptors and that transferrin-mediated iron uptake by Caco-2 cells is inhibited by apotransferrin to a larger extent than that predicted solely by receptor competition. This inhibition can have important implications in determining the net exchange of iron between intestinal cells and the basolateral milieu. Accordingly, we further characterized the endocytic cycles of apotransferrin and diferric transferrin in Caco-2 cells. We found that after internalization both apotransferrin and diferric transferrin recycled to the cell exterior, but that apotransferrin had a protracted endocytic cycle. Confocal microscopy studies revealed a different cellular distribution of apotransferrin and diferric transferrin; both were found in a compartment close to the basal membrane, but apotransferrin reached as well regions closer to the apical membrane. Moreover, the intracellular distribution of transferrin receptors was influenced by the iron load of transferrin; cells incubated with apotransferrin presented a more apical distribution of transferrin receptors than cells incubated with diferric transferrin. These results indicate for the first time that the endocytic cycle of transferrin receptors in intestinal epithelial cells is determined by the iron content of transferrin. They explain also the marked inhibitory effect of apotransferrin on transferrin-mediated iron uptake by Caco-2 cells, since incubation of cells with apotransferrin resulted in the actual sequestration of the receptor in the cell interior.

Iron is an essential nutrient involved in cellular functions related to the binding and transport of oxygen, redox reactions, detoxification, and nucleotide synthesis (1Wrigglesworth J.M. Baum H. Jacobs A. Worwood M Iron in Biochemistry and Medicine II. Academic Press, New York1980: 29-86Google Scholar). Excess iron is toxic, and healthy individuals maintain a balance between obligatory body iron losses and iron absorption (reviewed in Ref. 2Flanagan P.R. Acta Paediatr. Scand. Suppl. 1990; 361: 21-30Google Scholar). The mechanisms that establish body iron homeostasis are, therefore, of great importance. Although the mechanisms involved in the regulation of iron absorption are not well known, a model describing the sequential passage of iron from mucin to integrin and to mobilferrin gives important clues on the molecular components involved in iron absorption (3Conrad M.E. Umbreit J.N. Am. J. Hematol. 1993; 42: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Using Caco-2 cells grown in bicameral inserts as a model of intestinal epithelia, it was shown that iron uptake through the basolateral endocytosis of iron-containing transferrin (Tf) 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; diFeTf-FITC, diferric transferrin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate; RITC, rhodamine isothiocyanate; apoTf-RITC, apotransferrin labeled with rhodamine isothiocyanate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; diFeTf-FITC, diferric transferrin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate; RITC, rhodamine isothiocyanate; apoTf-RITC, apotransferrin labeled with rhodamine isothiocyanate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid.contributes importantly to the overall content of intracellular iron (4Nuñez M.T. Tapia V. Arredondo M. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and that the extent of apical iron uptake is inversely related to this content (5Alvarez-Hernandez X. Nichols G.M. Glass J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 110: 205-208Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 6Tapia V. Arredondo M. Nuñez M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G443-G447PubMed Google Scholar). The endocytic cycle of Tf has been thoroughly characterized in a variety of cells (reviewed in Ref. 7Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In many cell types internalized Tf first reaches the sorting endosome (pH 6.2) located in the peripheral cytoplasm, then moves to the recycling endosome (pH 6.4) and from there back to the cell surface (8Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 121: 1257-1269Crossref Scopus (409) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the endocytic cycle of apoTf has not been characterized. Using apoTf as ligand, an apical endocytic compartment, where basolateral internalized apoTf colocalized with an apical fluid face marker, was described (9Hughson E.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These findings were not complemented with studies using holoTf, to determine if both ligands have a different intracellular distribution, and the rationale for the use of apoTf was not given (9Hughson E.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). There is a relationship between apoTf and iron flux in intestinal epithelia cells, since basolateral apoTf increases the apical to basolateral iron flux in iron-deficient Caco-2 cells (10Alvarez-Hernandez X. Smith M. Glass J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1192: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of iron-containing Tfs to Tf receptors was competitively inhibited by apoTf, and apoTf inhibited Tf-mediated iron uptake in Caco-2 cells (4Nuñez M.T. Tapia V. Arredondo M. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This inhibition was larger than expected solely by receptor competition, suggesting that apoTf affects other step(s) in the iron uptake cycle. From the above, it follows that the ratio apoTf/holoTf in the basal medium should determine the amount of cellular iron in intestinal epithelia cells, which in turn could determine the extent of body iron absorption. In this study we decided to further investigate the behavior of both Tf and the Tf receptor when Tf was internalized in the apo or in the iron-containing form. We found that both diFeTf and apoTf recycled to the cell exterior, but apoTf had a protracted endocytic cycle. Confocal microscopy studies revealed that diFeTf and apoTf reached different intracellular compartments. Moreover, Tf receptors also carried an endocytic cycle that was dependent on whether the ligand was apoTf or diFeTf. These results indicate for the first time that the endocytic cycle of the Tf receptor in intestinal epithelia cells depends on its bound ligand. Caco-2 cells, from the American Type Culture Collection (no. HTB37, Rockville, MD), were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog no. 430-2100EC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Culture medium was changed every 3 days. For transport and binding experiments, cells were grown on 0.33-cm2 polycarbonate cell culture inserts, with 0.4-μm pore size membranes (Transwells, Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cells grown for 13–15 days were used (6Tapia V. Arredondo M. Nuñez M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G443-G447PubMed Google Scholar). Human apoTf (Sigma) was obtained by extensive dialysis of Tf against 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, as described previously (11Young S. Bomford A. Williams R. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and it was kept in saline (50 mm Na-MOPS, 94 mm NaCl, 7.4 mm KCl, 0.74 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4) plus 0.1 mm deferrioxamine (Sigma). DiFeTf was prepared from apoTf as described elsewhere (12Bali P.K. Harris W.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Tf was labeled with 125I to one iodine atom per molecule by the method of McFarlane (13McFarlane A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1963; 42: 346-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DiFeTf was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to 5–6 mol of FITC per mol of transferrin following the instructions of the manufacturer. The Tf-FITC adduct was separated from free FITC by filtration through Sephadex G-200, and it was either used at once or stored in aliquots at −20 °C until use. To obtain apoTf labeled with rhodamine isothiocyanate (RITC, Molecular Probes), diFeTf was incubated with RITC and gel-filtrated through Sephadex G-200 as described above, and the diFeTf-RITC adduct was converted to apoTf-RITC by dialysis against 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5. ApoTf-RITC was then equilibrated in saline containing 0.1 mm deferrioxamine (Sigma) and either used immediately or stored at −20 °C until use. To check for the possibility that the Tf-dye adducts could aggregate upon storage, we filtrated previously frozen aliquots of apoTf-RITC and diFeTf-FITC through Sephadex G-200. We did not observe the formation of aggregates under these conditions. Moreover, fractions corresponding to the beginning (“head”) and the end (“tail”) of the Tf peaks showed similar intracellular routings when tested by confocal microscopy. Therefore, the different routing of apoTf and diFeTf reported in this work cannot be ascribed to the aggregation of one of the Tfs. 125I-Tf internalization studies were done as follows. Endogenous Tf was eliminated with three incubations of insert-grown Caco-2 cells for 10 min at 37 °C with saline supplemented with 5 mm glucose and 0.1 mmdeferrioxamine. Cells, in triplicate wells, were then pulsed for 30 min at 37 °C in the above medium with either 0.1 μm125I-labeled diFeTf or 0.5 μm125I-labeled apoTf. The cells were washed three times with saline, and the internalized 125I label was chased for 0–30 min at 37 °C. The filters were excised with a scalpel, and the125I radioactivity in the cells, as well as in the basolateral medium, was determined in a Packard gamma radioactivity counter. Insert-grown cells were incubated for various times at 37 °C with either 0.1 μm125I-labeled diFeTf or 0.5 μm125I-labeled apoTf, in either saline or saline containing 0.43 m sucrose (14Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). When internalization of apoTf was determined, the incubation medium was supplemented with 0.1 mm deferrioxamine. The reaction was stopped, and cells were washed two times with cold saline. Surface-bound Tf was eliminated with an acid wash (15Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The filters containing the cells were then excised from the inserts with a scalpel, and the 125I radioactivity in the cells was determined as above. Cells grown in transparent inserts (Costar) were incubated from the basolateral side for 60 min at 37 °C with saline (50 mm Na-MOPS, 94 mmNaCl, 7.4 mm KCl, 0.74 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 μm diFeTf-FITC, 0.5 μm apoTf-RITC, and 0.1 mm deferrioxamine. Cells were washed with ice-cold saline, and surface-bound Tf was eliminated by acid wash (15Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The inserts, placed with their bases on top of a glass slide, were placed on the microscope stage so the direction of the laser beam was basal to apical. The optical sections had the same basal to apical direction. Samples were protected from photo-bleaching withslow-fade TM (Molecular Probes). To determine the cellular localization of the Tf receptor, cells were incubated with either 0.5 μm apoTf or 0.1 μm diFeTf as above. The cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.5% Triton X-100, and reacted with OKT9 monoclonal anti-Tf receptor antibody (the kind gift of Dr. A. Orellana). Second antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Sigma) labeled with RITC. Fluorescence was determined in the confocal microscope as described above. Fluorescence intensity due to Tf or Tf receptor distribution along the apical to basal axis was quantified from composites of basal to apical fluorescence given by the computer of the confocal microscope (for an example, see Fig.2 C). These composites were divided into 10 equal sections following the basal to apical axis, and the relative intensity of the bands was determined using the SigmaScan program (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Curve fitting was done using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The experiments shown were repeated two to four times. Variability between experiments was <10%. We recently reported that iron uptake from 0.1 μm diFeTf was 65% inhibited by 0.5 μm apoTf, while the expected inhibition, based on receptor competition, was only 25% (4Nuñez M.T. Tapia V. Arredondo M. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One possibility for this extra inhibition was different cell handling of these Tfs. Hence, we determined the kinetics of the endocytic cycle of apoTf and diFeTf in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1). Internalized diFeTf will be named “diFeTf,” although it should lose most of its iron during endocytosis (4Nuñez M.T. Tapia V. Arredondo M. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). DiFeTf presented a characteristic endocytic cycle kinetics with a t½ of about 25 min. ApoTf, instead, exhibited a protracted cycle with at½ of about 60 min (Fig. 1). We next studied the intracellular localization of internalized apoTf and diFeTf by confocal microscopy (Fig.2). A high degree of colocalization (yellow spots) were observed in a basal region, while in more apical regions a predominance of the pseudo-red apoTf fluorescence was observed (Fig. 2 A). A gallery of optical cuts (Fig. 2 B) and integration of the signal in the z axis (Fig. 2 C) showed a distinctive pattern of distribution for both labels, with a preferential basal distribution for diFeTf and a more apical distribution for apoTf. Densitometric analysis indicated that diFeTf distributed mainly in the first half of the basal to apical axis, while apoTf distributed also into the second third of the axis (Fig.3). The observed differences in endocytic cycle kinetics and intracellular localization of apoTf and diFeTf could be due to different mechanisms of internalization, e.g.clathrin-mediated or fluid phase endocytosis. Since only clathrin-mediated endocytosis is inhibited by hyperosmolarity (14Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), we tested its effect on the internalization of diFeTf or apoTf (Fig.4). Internalization rates (molecules of Tf internalized × h−1 × insert−1 × 10−4) under isotonic and hypertonic conditions were 18.2 and 8.1 for apoTf and 45.5 and 18.8 for diFeTf, respectively (Fig. 4). Hence, hyperosmolarity inhibited to the same extent the internalization of apoTf and diFeTf, although the internalization rate of diFeTf was 2.5-fold larger than the rate of apoTf internalization. These results indicate that in Caco-2 cells both apoTf and diFeTf undergo clathrin-mediated internalization, and hence are internalized bound to the Tf receptor. A different intracellular distribution of apoTf and diFeTf would result if one of the ligands,e.g. apoTf, dissociated from its receptor after internalization. Hence, we probed the location of Tf receptors after basolateral incubation of insert-grown Caco-2 cells with either apoTf or diFeTf. We found that, while incubation with diFeTf resulted in a receptor distribution mostly in the first half of the basal to apical axis, incubation with apoTf produced a more even distribution of receptors in this axis (Fig. 5). Thus, the distribution of Tf receptors followed closely in each case that of apoTf or diFeTf, an indication that these Tfs carried on their endocytic cycles bound to Tf receptors. In its simplest form, iron absorption can be described as the regulated passage of lumenal iron through the intestinal epithelia. This passage is regulated by the intracellular iron levels of intestinal epithelial cells (6Tapia V. Arredondo M. Nuñez M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G443-G447PubMed Google Scholar), and its adequate functioning maintains body iron homeostasis. It is therefore important to advance knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of intracellular iron concentration in intestinal epithelial cells. With this in mind, we characterized the endocytic cycle of apoTf and diFeTf in polarized Caco-2 cells. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that internalized apoTf took twice as long as diFeTf to externalize back to the basal medium. Therefore, apoTf not only competes with diFeTf for binding to the Tf receptor (4Nuñez M.T. Tapia V. Arredondo M. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but it actually sequesters the Tf receptor in intracellular compartments, rendering it unavailable for iron uptake. Blood plasma has a relation of apoTf to FeTf that varies from about 2 in individuals in iron balance to 10 or more in individuals with anemia secondary to iron deficiency (16Williams J. Moreton K. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because of the high concentration of Tf in plasma (about 35 μm), even in conditions of iron deficiency, there should be enough FeTf in plasma to provide for a full supplement of iron to intestinal cells (4Nuñez M.T. Tapia V. Arredondo M. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The simple mechanism of apoTf-mediated receptor competition/sequestration described here should effectively down-regulate Tf-mediated iron uptake in these cells. Thus, enterocytes of iron-deficient individuals would have lower intracellular iron levels and hence enhanced iron absorption. Confocal microscopy revealed differences in the distribution of internalized apo and diFeTf and of Tf receptors. It is puzzling why apoTf and diFeTf carry out different endocytic cycles since diFeTf delivers its iron in the process (4Nuñez M.T. Tapia V. Arredondo M. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The similar intracellular distribution found for Tfs and Tf receptors indicate that both apoTf and diFeTf carry on their endocytic cycles bound to their receptors. Two alternatives come to mind to explain these different distributions. It may be that after reaching a common basal compartment,e.g. the early endosome (7Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), the apoTf-Tf receptor complex could be targeted to an apical compartment, and from there back to the basolateral membrane. DiFeTf, on the other hand, could recycle back to the basolateral membrane directly from the basal compartment. Another possibility is that both apoTf and diFeTf pass through the apical compartment but that apoTf is retained longer than diFeTf in this compartment. Although the molecular bases that underlie this process are unknown, its functioning should help to regulate intracellular iron levels and iron absorption by intestinal cells. In summary, we determined that apoTf and diFeTf undergo different endocytic cycles in polarized Caco-2 cells. The protracted cycle of apoTf sequesters the Tf receptor inside the cell, making it less available for iron uptake. We propose that this mechanism regulates the extent of iron uptake by making it a function of plasma iron levels, and that it is part of the mechanism that determines the net flow of iron between the intestinal cell and blood plasma."

We recently proposed a model for activation in which activator A binds to monomer, E, to form EA, which subsequently dimerizes to the active form,E 2A2 (Cole, J. L., Carroll, S. S., and Kuo, L. C. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 3978–3981). Here, we have employed this model to define the equilibrium constants for activator binding (K a) and dimerization of EA toE 2A2 (K d) by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and fluorescence measurements. Multi-wavelength sedimentation data were globally fit to the model above, yielding values of K a = 1.69 μm and K d = 17.8 nm for 2′,5′-linked adenosine trimer. Fluorescent conjugates of 2′,5′-linked adenosine trimer with 7-hydroxycoumarin have been prepared. The coumarin emission anisotropy shows a large increases upon binding to RNase L. Analysis of anisotropy titrations yields values ofK a and K d close to those obtained by sedimentation. The sedimentation parameters for unmodified 2′,5′-linked adenosine trimer also agree with those obtained by enzyme kinetic methods (Carroll, S. S., Cole, J. L., Viscount, T., Geib, J., Gehman, J., and Kuo, L. C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19193–19198). Thus, the data presented here clearly define the energetics of RNase L activation and support the minimal activation model.

Thus, the data presented here clearly define the energetics of RNase L activation and support the minimal activation model. RNase L is an endoribonuclease involved in the interferon pathway. Upon activation by adenosine oligomers linked 2′ to 5′, RNase L degrades viral and cellular mRNAs, leading to an inhibition of protein synthesis in virally infected cells (1Kerr I.M. Brown R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 2Hovanessian A.G. Wood J.N. Virology. 1980; 101: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated by gel filtration, chemical cross-linking (3Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and analytical ultracentrifugation (4Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that RNase L exists as a monomer in solution but is dimerized in the presence of an activator, suggesting that the catalytically active form of RNase L is a homodimer. Under stoichiometric binding conditions, dimerization and activation of RNase L require the binding of one activator molecule per ribonuclease L monomer (4Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of an activator, only monomer is observed up to a protein concentration of at least 18 μm, indicating that unliganded enzyme is unable to dimerize, or the association is extremely weak. These observations support a minimal model for RNase L activation depicted in Scheme FS1. In the context of this model, the energetics of activation of RNase L are defined by two equilibrium dissociation constants,K a and K d. Note that this model is a subset of the full reaction scheme for a coupled ligand binding and enzyme dimerization equilibrium (5Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage: Functional Chemistry of Biological Macromolecules. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990: 203-236Google Scholar, 6Wong I. Lohman T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have also extended this model to include the substrate binding step and employed it to compare the activation of RNase L by analogs of the native activator (7Carroll S.S. Cole J.L. Viscount T. Geib J. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19193-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of our previous sedimentation equilibrium measurements (4 °C), the enzyme concentrations were much higher than either K a or K d. Thus, the stoichiometry of the interaction was defined, but the association constants were inaccessible. However, activator binding is highly temperature-dependent, such that at 20 °C association is weaker and directly accessible by biophysical measurements for several activators containing a 5′-OH group. In the present study, we have characterized the binding of several activators with both sedimentation equilibrium and fluorescence anisotropy measurements. The results are compared with those obtained by enzyme kinetic methods in the accompanying paper (7Carroll S.S. Cole J.L. Viscount T. Geib J. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol.

To reduce the UV absorbance due to oxidized DTT, the sample buffer (11 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 104 mm KCl, 5.8 mmMgCl2) was purged of oxygen by bubbling with argon prior to adding 2 mm DTT. The enzyme was equilibrated into the sample buffer using Bio-Rad Biospin 6 spin columns. Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 8.41 ± 0.87 × 104m−1 cm−1 (4Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 2′,5′-linked adenosine trimer (HO-2′,5′-A3) was obtained from the Midland Certified Reagent Company or from Sigma. The activators containing a free 2′-amino group, HO-2′,5′-A3-2′-NH2 and p-2′,5′-A3-2′-NH2, were obtained from NAPS GmbH, Goettingen, Germany. The oligoribonucleotide concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using ε260 nm = 1.53 × 104m−1cm−1/adenosine. The succinimidyl ester of 7-hydroxycoumarin-3-carboxylic acid (NHS-7HC) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Fluorescence activators were prepared by reacting NHS-7HC with HO-2′,5′-A3-2′-NH2 or p-2′,5′-A3-2′-NH2. NHS-7HC was dissolved inN,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 5 mm. The conjugation reactions were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.65, at a concentration of 20 μm oligoribonucleotide, 200 μm NHS-7HC at room temperature for 2 h. The conjugate was purified on reverse phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0.5–30% in 30 min, flow rate = 1 ml/min) in 50 mm aqueous triethylammonium acetate, pH 6.8. Representative elution times are: NHS-7HC, 12.95 min; HO-2′,5′-A3-2′-NH2, 10.13 min; HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC, 15.92 min. Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation were performed using six-channel (1.2-cm path) charcoal-Epon cells with a Beckman XL-A centrifuge and an An-60 Ti rotor at a speed of 14,000 rpm and a temperature of 20 °C unless otherwise indicated. Samples of 110-μl volume were loaded under argon. Scans were recorded at 230 and 260 nm using 0.001-cm point spacing and averaging 10 readings at each point. Equilibrium was judged to be achieved by the absence of systematic deviations in a plot of the difference between successive scans taken 4 h apart. For fluorescence experiments, 120-μl samples containing fluorescent activator and RNase L were prepared in sample buffer and allowed to equilibrate at least 2 h prior to measurement. Data were collected at 20 °C in 10 × 2-mm Hellma microcuvettes using an ISS K2 fluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 404 (16 nm bandpass), and emission was collected using a Schott KV-470 long pass glass filter. Steady-state anisotropy was measured in the l-format, and instrument G-factors were measured with the excitation polarizer in the horizontal position. Data for both the sample and buffer blank were collected for 2 s in each orientation, and at least three measurements were averaged. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed using the phase modulation method over a frequency range of 5–190 MHz. The lifetime reference was Me2POPOP in ethanol, (τ = 1.45 ns) (9Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 88Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium data were globally fit using the Marquardt-Levenberg least squares algorithm with the SAS software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Within the context of Scheme FS1, the concentrations of EA andE 2A2 can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constants K a andK d and the concentrations of E and A.[EA]=[E][A]KaEquation 1 *E2A2]=*EA*2Kd=1Kd*E**A*Ka2Equation 2 Our method to determine the dissociation constants relies on the differences in the absorption spectra of E and A and is similar to the approach described by Lewis and co-workers (10Lewis M.S. Shrager R.I. Kim S.-J. Shuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 94-115Crossref Google Scholar) to characterize protein-DNA interactions. We can express the absorbance at any wavelength as the sum of the contributions from each of the species participating in the equilibriumA(λ)=ελ,E[E]+ελ,A[A]+(ελ,E+ελ,A)[EA]+2(ελ,E+ελ,A)[E2A2]Equation 3 where ελ, E is the molar extinction coefficient of E at wavelength λ; and ελ,A is the molar extinction coefficient of A at wavelength λ. Substituting Equations 1 and 2 into Equation 3 gives the following.A(λ)=ελ,E[E]+ελ,A[A]+(ελ,E+ελ,A)[E][A]KaEquation 4 +2(ελ,E+ελ,A)1Kd[E][A]Ka2Finally, in the presence of a centrifugal field we can express the absorbance at wavelength λ and radius r,A(λ,r), asA*λ,r*=δλ+ελ,EC0EeςEξ+ελ,AC0AeςAξ+*ελ,E+ελ,A*C0EC0Ae−lnKa+*ςE+ςA*ξ+2*ελ,E+ελ,A**C0EC0A*2e−lnKd−2lnKa+2*ςE+ςA*ξEquation 5 where δλis the baseline offset at wavelength λ, C 0 E is the molar concentration of E at the reference distancer 0, ς E is the reduced molecular weight of E, and ξ = (r2 − r 02)/2, C 0A and ςA are defined analogously. The natural logarithms ofK a and K d are the fitted quantities to constrain the dissociation constants to be positive. The value of ς E was experimentally measured by sedimentation equilibrium of RNase L alone at 14,000 rpm, and ςA was obtained for each activator by sedimentation equilibrium at 45,000 rpm. Because of the low molecular weight of the activators, δ260 could not be obtained by overspeeding following the run. Therefore, we used a mass conservation method in which δ260 was measured as the difference in the integrated absorption at 260 nm at equilibrium at 14,000 rpm and the absorbance at 260 nm at the beginning of the run. Because the activators do not contribute much absorbance at 230, δ230was measured by overspeeding to 45,000 rpm following the centrifugation experiment at 14,000 rpm. For each experiment three channels containing different activator concentrations were analyzed globally at 230 and 260 nm where C 0A andC 0 E were treated as local fitting parameters, and K a and K d were global parameters. The fluorescence anisotropy titration data were fit using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm within the IGOR Pro software package (Wavemetrics, Inc.). From Equations 1 and 2 and mass conservation it can be shown that*A*=−*E*Ka+1+*E*Ka+12+8Kd*E*Ka2*A*T4Kd*E*Ka2Equation 6 where [A]T refers to the total activator concentration. Under conditions where [A]T ≪ [E]T one can make the approximation that [E] ∼ [E]T. The observed anisotropy r obs is given as the sum of the anisotropies of the individual species weighted by the molar concentration of A in each speciesrobs=([A]+[EA])rf+2[E2A2]rbR[A]+[EA]+2[E2A2]REquation 7 where r f is the anisotropy of the free activator A, and r b is anisotropy of the bound activator in the species E 2A2. We assign the anisotropy of EA to be equal tor f; the justification is presented below. Equation 7 includes a quenching factor R, which is the ratio of the quantum yields of the free and bound forms (9Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 88Google Scholar). The titrations of RNase L were performed at four activator concentrations under conditions where [A]T ≤ 5[E]T. The value of R was take to be 0.40 based on the limiting intensity decrease at high enzyme concentration. The value of r f was measured experimentally. For both the sedimentation and fluorescence experiments the joint confidence intervals for the fitted values of K a andK d were obtained by a search of the error surface in which one parameter was fixed, and the all the other parameters were allowed to adjust to their best fit values. This method correctly accounts for the cross-correlation (nonorthogonality) of the fitting parameters and the nonlinearity of the fitting equation (11Beechem J.M. Gratton E. Ameloot M. Knutson J.R. Brand L. Lakowicz J. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1991: 241-305Google Scholar, 12Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Our previous studies of activator-induced dimerization of RNase L by sedimentation equilibrium were performed at 4 °C, using conditions where [E] ≫ K a and K d, so that the stoichiometry could be characterized (4Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, for the weaker activators, such as HO-2′,5′-A3, activator-induced dimerization is not stoichiometric at the higher temperature of 20 °C. 2J. L. Cole, unpublished observations. Thus, sedimentation equilibrium data obtained under these conditions may be used to extractK a and K d. The radial absorbance profiles contain contributions from each of the species participating in the equilibrium: E, A, EA, andE 2A2; these data can be fit to Equation 5 to obtain K a and K d. To define the contributions of RNase L and activator at each radial position we have taken advantage of differences in their absorption spectra. Fig. 1 shows that at enzyme and activator concentrations typically used in our experiments the 230 nm absorbance is dominated by the contribution from the enzyme, whereas the 260 nm absorbance is dominated by the activator. Thus, we record data for each channel at both of these wavelengths and fit using a single value ofC 0A andC 0 E. To further constrain the fits, data can be obtained at several concentrations of enzyme and activator. We have found that three activator concentrations are sufficient to define K a and K d for the activators used in this study. Fig. 2 shows the sedimentation equilibrium data obtained at 230 and 260 nm for samples loaded at a concentration of 0.5 μm RNase L and 1, 3, and 10 μmHO-2′,5′-A3. The data have been fit to Equation 5; thesolid lines are the best fit to the data, theinsets are the residuals, and the results are summarized in Table I. There is a weak positive systematic deviation in the residuals at 230 nm for the data obtained at 1 and 10 μm and a negative deviation for the data obtained at 3 μm. These deviations are likely due to errors in the baseline offset term δ230. However, outside of these deviations the fit is quite good. Although baseline errors result in higher r.m.s. deviations, in the range of 0–0.02 OD they do not affect the fitted values of K a or K d significantly as defined by the 1 S.D. confidence intervals.2Table IKa and Kd values determined by sedimentation equilibriumActivatorModel1-aThe data were fit according to the models depicted in either Scheme FS1 or Scheme 2.K aK dr.m.s.1-bRoot mean square deviation of the fit in absorbance units.μ mnmHO-2′,5′-A311.69 (1.24, 2.38)17.8 (11.9, 24.4)0.00661HO-2′,5′-A322.09 ± 10−71380.0107HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC12.67 (1.19, 30.1) 1.72 (0.02, 5.43)0.00681Samples were prepared at 20 °C in buffer containing 11 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 104 mm KCl. 58 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm DTT.

Open table in a new tab Samples were prepared at 20 °C in buffer containing 11 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 104 mm KCl. 58 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. Data sets were collected 14,000 rpm from three channels at two wavelengths (230 and 260 nm) and were globally analyzed to obtain K a andK d. The values in parentheses refer to the 1 S.D. joint confidence intervals. Fig. 3 shows a contour plot of the fit error surface for the data in Fig. 1 as a function of lnK a and lnK d. The values of lnK a and lnK d were fixed, and the other parameters were allowed to adjust to the best fit values. The inner contour is drawn at 1 S.D., and the outer contour is at 2 S.D. joint confidence intervals. The shape of the contours is typical for a system exhibiting parameter cross-correlation (12Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In our case, there is negative correlation between lnK a and lnK d. Despite this correlation, the system exhibits a single, well defined fit minimum. As shown in Table I, the 1 S.D. joint confidence intervals correspond to about a 2-fold change in either K a orK d. The validity of this fitting procedure was also verified using simulated data. Extinction coefficients and reduced molecular weights were fixed at the experimental values for RNase L and HO-2′,5′-A3. Data were simulated according to Scheme FS1 with a loading concentration of 0.5 μm enzyme and 1, 3, and 10 μm activator. Random Gaussian noise of amplitude 0.0062 r.m.s. was added to corresponding to typical data obtained with our XL-A centrifuge. With values of K a andK d fixed at the experimental determined values from Table I, the fitting procedure recovers the correct values with 1 S.D. joint confidence intervals of 1.31–1.89 μm forK a and 15.1–21.8 nm forK d. The slightly greater width of the experimental confidence intervals presumably reflects the contributions of small systematic errors in the fixed parameters. Table I also shows values of K a andK d and r.m.s. errors obtained from fitting the same sedimentation data to an alternative association model in whichE dimerizes to form E 2, which is then competent to bind two activator molecules to formE 2A2 (Scheme 2). In this case, K a is found to be 7 orders of magnitude lower than in the previous fit, and K d is significantly higher. The r.m.s. deviation is also elevated relative to the previous fit. To compare directly the sedimentation equilibrium and fluorescence anisotropy methods, we characterized one of the fluorescent activators, HO-2′,5′-A3-2′-7HC, using the sedimentation equilibrium protocol. Initial measurements indicated that K d for the activator is significantly lower than for HO-2′,5′-A3. Therefore we have obtained sedimentation equilibrium data at a lower enzyme concentration of 0.2 μm and three activator concentrations of 0.2, 0.6, and 2 μm. As shown in TableI, the best fit parameters for HO-2′,5′-A3-2′-7HC areK a = 2.67 μm and K d = 1.72 nm. The joint confidence intervals for this fit are much broader than for HO-2′,5′-A3, so that the change inK a relative to HO-2′,5′-A3 is not statistically significant. However, the decrease inK d is significant. As in the case of HO-2′,5′-A3, simulations were performed with the experimentally derived parameters and Gaussian noise of 0.0062 OD r.m.s. amplitude. Again, the correct values of K a and K d are recovered from the fitting procedure with joint confidence intervals of 1.50–8.62 μm forK a and 0.19–4.35 nm forK d. Thus, the increased breadth in the confidence intervals for the fit of HO-2′,5′-A3-2′-7HC are also reflected in the simulations. A fluorescence activator binding assay was developed to characterize independently the equilibria depicted in Scheme FS1. Fluorescent activators, synthesized from 2′,5′-oligoadenylate precursors containing a single 2′-NH2moiety, were prepared by standard amine coupling reactions. We found that activator conjugates with the NHS ester of NHS-7HC exhibited very useful fluorescence properties. Coupling reactions were characterized by HPLC and spectrophotometry. The product was identified based on the appearance of an HPLC peak with retention time different from either unconjugated oligonucleotide or the reactive fluorophore. In all cases, a single predominant product was formed in the reaction. No new HPLC peaks were formed in a reaction of NHS-7HC with HO-2′,5′-A3lacking a 2′-NH2 group. Thus, the chemistry is specific for the 2′-NH2 group. The identity of the product was confirmed by absorption spectrophotometry. In aqueous solution, the NHS-7HC exhibits one predominant absorption band at 415 nm without appreciable absorption near 260 nm. In contrast, the product p-2′,5′-A3-7HC exhibits two absorption bands at 405 and 260 nm. Thus, the absorption spectral features are consistent with the proposed structure. The fluorescence emission parameters of p-2′,5′-A3-7HC are summarized in Table II. The emission maximum is at 446 nm (uncorrected). Addition of a slight molar excess of RNase L results in about 60% quenching in the fluorescence amplitude and a slight shift in the emission maximum to 451 nm. A dramatic effect is observed in steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, which increases from 0.05 to 0.33 upon binding RNase L. Further addition of RNase L does not result in appreciable increase in the fluorescence changes. Table II also shows that the fluorescence lifetime is 3.5 ns in the absence and 3.4 ns in the presence of RNase L. Because there is no marked change in the lifetime, the observed increase in anisotropy of p-2′,5′-A3-7HC observed upon binding to RNase L is clearly due to an increase in the rotational correlation time. 3For a simple system with a single fluorescence lifetime (τ) and a single rotational correlation time (φ), the steady-state anisotropy is given by r =r 0/(1 + (τ/φ)), wherer 0 is the intrinsic anisotropy in the absence of rotation. Thus, a change in the value of r can be ascribed to change in φ only if independent fluorescence lifetime measurements indicate that τ is constant. Similar spectral perturbations and anisotropy increases are observed for HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC, which lacks a 5′ phosphate. 4J. L. Cole and E. S. Blue, unpublished observations. Because the anisotropy increase is very large upon binding, we have chosen to use this parameter for quantitative characterization of the dissociation constants.Table IIFluorescence changes for RNase L binding to p-2′,5′-A3-7HCSampleλmax2-aFluorescence emission maximum.

The interaction of p-2′,5′-A3-7HC with RNase L is too strong to be readily characterized by fluorescence anisotropy experiments, where the lowest accessible fluorophore concentration is about 2 nm. However, the values of K a and K d for HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC, which lacks a 5′-phosphate, are accessible to fluorescence measurements. Fig.4 shows a series of RNase L titrations performed at four activator concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 nm. At each activator concentration the anisotropy shows a pseudo-hyperbolic increase with increasing enzyme concentration. The plateau value of the anisotropy observed at the highest enzyme concentration of 2 μm decreases with decreasing activator concentration. In contrast, the half-maximum point is not strongly dependent on activator concentration. We have globally fit these data to Equations 6 and 7. To reduce the number of floating parameters it is necessary to constrain the value of the emission anisotropy of EA,rE A. The two limiting cases we have considered arerE A =r f andrE A =r b. Fig. 4 shows a fit of the data assumingrE A =r f, and the fitted parameters are in TableIII. The fitted curves overlay the data quite well (r.m.s. deviation of 0.0131), and the best fit values ofK a = 1.32 μm and K d = 1.09 nm agree well with those determined by sedimentation; however, the joint confidence intervals are much narrower for the fluorescence results. A much poorer fit is obtained assuming rE A =r b (r.m.s. = 0.0229), and the values ofK a = 44.1 μm and K d near 1 pm are not compatible with the sedimentation data. We have also considered the intermediate model in whichrE A =r b/2. The quality of this fit is intermediate between the two former cases (r.m.s. = 0.0204), and the values ofK a and K d are close to that determined assuming rE A =r f. In all of these cases we have also assumed that the 60% quenching only occurs upon dimerization of EA to form E 2A2. However, the values of the equilibrium constants and the fit quality are not very sensitive to the extent of quenching of EA. We conclude that the simplest model capable of fitting the data is that the anisotropy of HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC is not strongly changed upon complexation to EA but increases dramatically upon dimerization ofEA.Table IIIKa and Kd values for HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC determined by fluorescence anisotropy titrationModel3-aThe data were fit according to Equations 6 and 7 using three different assumptions regarding the anisotropy of theEA species.

Data were collected using the same conditions as in Table II with activator concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 50 nm and were globally fit to obtain K a and K d. The values in parentheses refer to the 1 S.D. joint confidence intervals. The sedimentation equilibrium and fluorescence data presented here define the energetics of RNase L activation by the 2′,5′-linked adenosine trimers HO-2′,5′-A3 and HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC and provide support for the minimal activation model presented in Scheme FS1. For these activators,K a is in the low micromolar range, andK d is in the low nanomolar range. The value ofK d is decreased by about 10-fold for the latter activator relative to HO-2′,5′-A3. Despite the correlation of the K a and K d parameters in fitting the sedimentation and fluorescence data, global analysis of data obtained over a range of activator and/or enzyme concentrations gives rise to well defined fit minima and joint confidence intervals. For HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC, the lower value ofK d gives rise to broad confidence intervals for the sedimentation fitting parameters. However, the confidence intervals for the anisotropy parameters are quite narrow, and there is good agreement between the best fit values of K a andK d for this activator determined by the two independent methods. The values of K a and K d obtained by sedimentation equilibrium may also be compared with those determined by kinetic methods (7Carroll S.S. Cole J.L. Viscount T. Geib J. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19193-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using a model that explicitly accounts for substrate binding, we have found that for a given activator,K a and K d are dependent on the identity of the substrate: K a is about 3-fold higher for C11U2C7 than for C11UC8, whereas K d is about 5-fold lower. The parameters obtained by sedimentation measurements for HO-2′,5′-A3 agree more closely with the kinetic data obtained with poorer substrate C11UC8, such that K a and K d determined by the two methods are within a factor of 2. The sedimentation equilibrium data are also capable of distinguishing the activation model presented in Scheme FS1 from the alternative model in Scheme 2. In the latter case, the enzyme monomer is capable of dimerization prior to binding activator. Although both models are consistent with our earlier stoichiometry measurements, the absence of any detectable dimer in the absence of activator at enzyme concentrations up to at least 18 μm strongly suggested that activator binding precedes dimerization (4Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, the data fit well to the model in Scheme FS1, but the large increase in r.m.s. for the alternative model (Scheme 2) indicates that it does not describe the data adequately. Most importantly, the deduced value ofK d = 138 nm is not consistent with the absence of measurable dimerization of free enzyme at micromolar concentrations. Thus, Scheme FS1 represents the minimal model capable of describing the sedimentation equilibrium data. The fluorescence anisotropy data are also consistent with the model in Scheme FS1, but they cannot easily be used to distinguish different models because of the need to constrain the value ofrE A. The binding data obtained at several activator concentrations fit well to Scheme FS1 if it is assumed that the anisotropy increase only occurs upon dimerization of EA and fit less well to models that invoke an increase in anisotropy upon binding of A to E to form EA. This observation is surprising, since one might expect that the mobility of the fluorophore would be at least partially restricted upon binding, especially given the short linker between the oligoadenylate moiety and the fluorophore. It is likely that some anisotropy increase upon formation of EA does actually occur but is masked by the very large increase observed upon dimerization toE 2A2. In any case, the fitted values of K a and K d are not strongly dependent on the value ofrE A. It is noteworthy that RNase L is monomeric at protein concentrations up to at least 18 μm, whereas in the presence of activator the K d for dimerization is in the nanomolar range. Thus, activator binding increases dimerization affinity by a factor of at least 105–106, corresponding to strong thermodynamic linkage. The structural basis of this linkage is not yet clear. The activator binding site may be distant from the dimerization interface and modulate dimerization via a long range conformational change. Alternatively, activator binding may occur at or near the dimerization interface and directly modify the interactions that govern dimerization. There is precedence for strong linkage between dimerization and ligand binding in the Escherichia coli Rep helicase system. In the absence of DNA, Rep exists as a monomer at concentrations of at least 8 μm (13Chao K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1165-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, dimerization is induced upon binding DNA with a K d of about 5 nm, indicating an enhancement of dimerization of at least 104-fold (14Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strong coupling of enzyme dimerization to activator binding presumably represents a physiological mechanism to control RNase L activity. The enzyme kinetic data suggest that monomeric RNase L is inactive (7Carroll S.S. Cole J.L. Viscount T. Geib J. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19193-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the ability of various oligoadenylates to activate RNase L correlates with enzyme dimerization (3Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylates is performed by a family of double-stranded RNA-activated synthetases which are induced by interferon treatment (15Hovanessian A.G. Brown R.E. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1977; 268: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although there are low, basal levels of RNase L expression in most mammalian cells (less than one part in 500,000 of the protein in mouse liver), it is also induced during interferon treatment (16Silverman R.H. Jung D.D. Nolan-Sorden N.L. Dieffenbach C.W. Kedar V.P. SenGupta D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7336-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to Scheme FS1, formation ofE 2A2, and therefore the specific activity of RNase L, is dependent on the concentrations of bothE and A. Coordinate induction of 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylate synthetases and RNase L by interferon would serve to prime the system for a high level of RNase L activity upon activation of the synthetases by double-stranded RNA. We thank Fritz Benseler for suggesting the use of a 2′-amino group for synthesis of fluorescent activators and Marc Lewis for help with the mathematical formalism for the analysis of heterogeneous associations."
https://openalex.org/W2048592696,"Previous studies of wild-type and mutant forms of a recombinant copper amine oxidase from Hansenula polymorpha, expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have indicated a self-processing mechanism for 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine (topa) quinone biogenesis involving the active site copper (Cai, D., and Klinman, J. P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32039–32042). In contrast to prokaryotic copper amine oxidases, however, it has not been possible to initiate topa quinone formation by the addition of exogenous copper to precursorH. polymorpha amine oxidase lacking copper. Metal analysis of copper-depleted wild-type enzyme reveals 0.2–0.3 mol copper, together with 0.6 mol zinc. Despite changes in the zinc and copper levels in growth media, the level of zinc in purified enzyme remains fairly constant. Further, we have been unable to displace protein-bound zinc by exogenously added copper. The H. polymorpha amine oxidase gene was subsequently expressed in Escherichia coliand found to be almost completely free of copper and zinc. In vitro reconstitution of this apoprotein confirms that zinc binds to H. polymorpha amine oxidase and prevents reconstitution with copper. By contrast, addition of copper first to apoprotein leads to formation of topa quinone and stable activity in the presence of added zinc. These findings indicate efficient binding of either zinc or copper to a site that undergoes little or no exchange. The data confirm that topa quinone biogenesis in the H. polymorpha system is catalyzed by copper and occurs in the absence of added factors. We conclude that the mechanisms of cofactor biogenesis in pro- and eukaryotic systems are likely to be similar or identical.

Copper amine oxidases from all sources, which include bacteria, yeast, plant, and mammals, contain 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine (topa) 1The abbreviations used are: topa, 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine; ICP, inductively coupled plasma; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; TPQ, topa quinone.1The abbreviations used are: topa, 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine; ICP, inductively coupled plasma; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; TPQ, topa quinone. quinone as the redox cofactor (1Klinman J.P. Mu D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 299-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the precursor for topa quinone is a peptidyl tyrosine residue contained in an active site consensus sequence, Asn-Tyr-Asp/Glu, and that the precursor tyrosine is converted to topa quinone by a post-translational modification process (2Janes S.M.

Heterologous gene expression of a copper amine oxidase fromHansenula polymorpha in Saccharomyces cerevisiaehas produced a functional recombinant enzyme with an active site indistinguishable from the native enzyme (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on the fact thatS. cerevisiae is one of the few yeast species that does not have an endogenous amine oxidase (6Large P.J. Yeast. 1986; 2: 1-34Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we have concluded that the modification of the precursor tyrosine to topa quinone occurs through post-translational autoprocessing (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A mechanism to account for the oxidation of the tyrosyl side chain through the involvement of a bound copper in precursor protein has been proposed (cf. Ref. 3Mu D. Janes S.M. Smith A.J. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7979-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of either the active site consensus sequence or the copper binding site support an essential role for copper in topa biogenesis via a self-catalytic mechanism (7Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32039-32042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biogenesis of topa quinone has also been studied with a bacterial system in which the gene for phenethylamine oxidase or a histamine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis was expressed inEscherichia coli (8Matsuzaki R. Fukui T. Sato H. Ozaki Y. Tanizawa K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9Matsuzaki R. Suzuki S. Yamaguchi K. Fukui T. Tanizawa K.

These studies show that the recombinant protein produced in a copper-free state lacks the topa quinone cofactor. Subsequent addition of exogenous cupric ion to the purified protein under aerobic conditions leads to rapid formation of the active site topa quinone, as indicated by its characteristic absorption in the visible region and the appearance of enzyme activity. Using the wild-type yeast copper amine oxidase from H. polymorpha expressed in S. cerevisiae, our preliminary study on the effect of copper has yielded very different results from the bacterial enzyme; specifically, we have been unable to performin vitro reconstitution studies by addition of copper to topa-free protein. This raised the possibility of fundamentally different biogenetic pathways for TPQ formation in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Reported herein are the metal binding properties of the recombinant H. polymorpha amine oxidase expressed inS. cerevisiae or E. coli under normal or copper-depleted conditions, together with results from the in vitro reconstitution of inactive enzymes with either copper or zinc. Major differences between enzyme isolated from S. cerevisiae and E. coli expression systems are observed, which we attribute to different pathways for the in vivoassembly of metalloproteins in these species. From the properties ofin vitro reconstitution studies of the H. polymorpha amine oxidase expressed in E. coli, we conclude that the mechanisms of cofactor biogenesis in pro- and eukaryotic systems are likely to be similar or identical. Under normal growing conditions, S. cerevisiae strain CG379 bearing the expression vector for the H. polymorpha amine oxidase was maintained and cultured in synthetic minimal media supplemented with 50 mg/liter each adenine, histidine, and tryptophan and 75 mg/liter leucine (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The synthetic minimal medium contained 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Fisher Scientific), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose (11Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). To prepare copper-free medium, the yeast nitrogen base was left out and substituted by the buffer, mineral, and vitamin components according to Sherman (11Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) but lacking cupric sulfate. The media were made with Milli-Q deionized water (Millipore), and the cultures were grown in plastic Erlenmeyer flasks. For large scale cultures, one colony grown on a regular medium plate was streaked on a copper-free medium plate, which was subsequently used as the inoculum for liquid cultures. Copper-free and zinc-limited media were prepared the same way as the copper-free media except that zinc sulfate was present at 80 μg/liter, which was 20% of the normal amount in the yeast nitrogen base. Copper-free and zinc-rich media were prepared with zinc sulfate present at 1.6 mg/liter, four times the normal level, or at 4.0 mg/ml, 10 times the normal level. The recombinant H. polymorpha amine oxidase produced in the copper-free, copper-free and zinc-limited, or copper-free and zinc-rich media was purified according to our previously established procedure without the fast protein liquid chromatography step (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32039-32042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yield for purified protein was 1.5–2.0 mg/liter original culture. Typically, cells harvested from 10 liters of the overnight cultures were used for one protein preparation. All solutions used throughout the purification were made in deionized water without further treatment. The purified protein was dialyzed in 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, or in 5 mm sodium-HEPES, pH 7.0. The sodium salt and the free acid forms of HEPES were ultrapure grade from Calbiochem. The protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The E. coli expression vectors pET3a and pET11a, as well as the E. coli strains XL1-blue and BL21(DE3), were from Stratagene. The amine oxidase gene from H. polymorpha in pTZ19R (12de Hoop M.J. Valkema R. Kienhuis C.B.M. Hoyer M.A. AB G. Yeast. 1992; 8: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was isolated as a 2.3-kilobase EagI fragment lacking 15 codons from the 5′-end. The complementary synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-TATGGCTGCCTC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGAGGCAGCCA-3′ were used as an adapter for insertion of theEagI fragment into the NdeI site of pET3a. The resulting expression plasmid, pKW2, contains the H. polymorpha sequence commencing at codon 13 (13Bruinenberg P.G. Evers M. Waterham H.R. Kuipers J. Arnberg A.C. AB G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1008: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) fused to the translation initiation codon of the vector. Partial digestion of pKW2 with NdeI, followed by BamHI digestion, resulted in a 2.3-kilobase fragment containing the H. polymorphasequence, which was then inserted between the NdeI andBamHI sites of pET11a to give pKW3. XL1-blue was used during all subcloning procedures. For subsequent protein expression, pKW3 was used to transform BL21(DE3). BL21(DE3)/pKW3 cells were grown for 16 h at 37 °C on ZB-agar (14Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μg/ml sodium ampicillin. Copper depleted M9ZB medium (14Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) was prepared with water passed through a milli-Q purification system (Millipore) in triple-rinsed plastic ware. All chemicals were of analytical grade. Solutions of Amicase casein, acid hydrolysate (Sigma), at 2 × concentration were stirred for 30 min in the presence of chelex resin (Sigma) before filtration and dilution with 2 × M9 salts. For medium not depleted in copper, tryptone was used in place of casein hydrolysate. Individual colonies from the overnight plates were used to inoculate 125 ml of copper-depleted M9ZB medium plus 100 μg/ml sodium ampicillin, which was then incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 5 h. This culture was diluted into 3 Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 400 ml of the same medium, and growth was continued until the cell density reachedA 600 = 0.6 (approximately 5 h). Penicillamine (1.5 mm) and IPTG (1 mm) were then added, and growth at 37 °C was continued for 4 h. Protein purification was performed as for the protein expressed in yeast (7Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32039-32042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. All solutions contained 1 mm EDTA plus 1 mm diethyldithiocarbamate to retard copper incorporation into apoprotein. The cleared cell lysate was dialyzed against 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm diethyldithiocarbamate without ammonium sulfate precipitation before ion exchange chromatography. Gel filtration through Sephacryl S-300 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm diethyldithiocarbamate was on a 100-cm-long column; proteins were eluted with the same buffer. The most pure fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium-HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 μm EDTA. Protein purity was judged to be >90% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a typical yield of 3 mg/liter of original culture. This can be compared with a yield of 1.5–2.0 mg/liter when recombinant enzyme is purified from S. cerevisiae grown in copper-depleted media. The amine oxidase activity was assayed at 37 °C with 5 mm benzylamine as the substrate as described previously (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Reaction with phenylhydrazine has been described (7Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32039-32042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The copper and zinc standard solutions were of atomic absorption grade purchased from Fisher Scientific. The copper content of the purified protein was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy as described previously (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the zinc content by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy using a Perkin-Elmer Plasma 40 instrument. The zinc line at 213.8 nm was used for the ICP measurement. The protein-bound copper was calculated by the standard addition method unless otherwise indicated. The zinc content was calculated against a zinc standard curve for 0–40 ppb of zinc. The “Cu-free”H. polymorpha amine oxidase purified from S. cerevisiae was dialyzed against 5 mm sodium-HEPES, pH 7.0. For the direct incubation with copper, the Cu-free protein was further dialyzed against deionized water. Following 21 h of incubation at 25 °C with an equal molar concentration of CuSO4 in deionized water, the protein solution was back-dialyzed against deionized water and analyzed for copper content, protein concentration, and the enzyme activity. The enzyme activity was assayed by monitoring the oxygen consumption rate at 25 °C in 3 mm ethylamine, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. For the reconstitution by step dialysis at 4 °C, 300 μl of the Cu-free protein (0.36 mg total) was dialyzed sequentially against 10 mm sodium-HEPES (250 ml), pH 7.0, containing 0.025, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 μm CuSO4, which was 2, 11, 100, and 1000 equivalents of the protein present in the dialysis bag, respectively. Between each increase in CuSO4 concentration, the protein was dialyzed at least twice against buffer alone to remove excess copper. About 50 μl of the dialyzed protein solution was drawn and analyzed for the copper content, protein concentration, and the enzyme activity. The copper content was estimated based on a copper standard curve for 0–40 ppb of copper prepared in the same buffer. The enzyme activity was assayed at 37 °C in 5 mmbenzylamine, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2 (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). There was little difference in growth when S. cerevisiae cells were grown in the normal or the copper-free media, indicating that the trace amount of copper contained in the copper-free media was sufficient for the biosynthesis of essential copper enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, to support the normal aerobic growth of the yeast. Consistent with this notion that the media contained trace copper, the purified H. polymorphaamine oxidase from the copper-free media was only partially copper-free. In general, based on the atomic absorption, 20–30% of purified protein was copper-bound, compared with near 100% for a normal enzyme preparation (Table I). The specific activity of such a protein preparation was also about 20% of the normal level. Although the protein-bound copper has been implicated in the catalytic cycle of copper amine oxidase (15Dooley D.M. McGuirl M.A. Brown D.E. Turowski P.N. McIntire W.S. Knowles P.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16McCracken J. Peisach J. Cote C.E. McGuirl M.A. Dooley D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3715-3720Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the reduction in enzyme activity seen herein can be correlated with a reduction in topa quinone content. The absorption spectrum of a purified Cu-free enzyme sample, which was > 85% pure as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, displays a λmax in the visible region identical to that of a normal enzyme (Fig.1 A; see Ref. 5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the absorbance is much less than that of the normal enzyme of similar purity,i.e. for a solution of 1 mg/ml, the absorbance is 0.007 for the Cu-free enzyme while it is 0.022 for the normal enzyme. Because the absorbance at 472 nm is proportional to the amount of topa quinone, a 70% reduction indicates a decrease of the topa quinone content in the Cu-free enzyme by ∼70%. Reconstitution experiments were performed with the purified protein, produced in the copper-free medium. The results from the direct incubation (Table I) indicate that unlike the phenethylamine oxidase of A. globiformis (8Matsuzaki R. Fukui T. Sato H. Ozaki Y. Tanizawa K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the incubation of the Cu-free protein with equimolar copper for up to 21 h did not increase the stoichiometry of the protein-bound copper or the enzyme-specific activity. In a step dialysis experiment with purified protein (see “Experimental Procedures”), the copper content was increased anomolously to greater than 1 copper/subunit when the protein was dialyzed in 0.1 μm or higher CuSO4solution (up to 4 Cu/subunit in 2.5 μmCuSO4). At the same time, the enzyme-specific activity decreased by up to 92% in 2.5 μm CuSO4. We attribute the excess copper to nonspecific binding of copper to the protein, which in turn is the cause of the observed enzyme inhibition.Table IMetal analyses and specific activity of various forms of H. polymorpha amine oxidase expressed in S. cerevisiaeSampleMetal contentSpecific activity, units/mg (% of wild-type)Cu/subunitZn/subunitCu-free wild-type1-aThe Cu-free wild-type protein was concentrated in 5 mm sodium-HEPES, pH 7.0.

A direct comparison of the metal contents was possible because all samples had similar purity (>85%) as judged on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Although the H. polymorpha amine oxidase expressed inS. cerevisiae was not truly copper-free, the overall effect of copper depletion on topa quinone formation agrees with results obtained with the phenethylamine and histamine oxidases of A. globiformis expressed in E. coli, i.e. that copper is required for topa quinone formation in vivo (8Matsuzaki R. Fukui T. Sato H. Ozaki Y. Tanizawa K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,10Choi Y.-H. Matsuzaki R. Fukui T. Shimizu E. Yorifuji T. Sato H. Ozaki Y. Tanizawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4712-4720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the in vitro reconstitution appeared to be very different. While the generation of topa quinone is spontaneous with the bacterial enzyme following the addition of exogenous copper, it was not possible to carry out a similar experiment with H. polymorpha enzyme expressed in S. cerevisiae. This suggested the possibility of fundamental differences between the bacterial and the yeast enzyme with regard to the mechanism of in vitro reconstitution. As an alternative explanation, we examined the possibility that the metal sites of the Cu-free H. polymorpha amine oxidase were occupied by other transition metals. There are a number of documented examples of the ability of zinc to bind to native copper sites (e.g. in superoxide dismutase (17Lu Y. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Valentine J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3560-3562Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and in azurin, (18Lowery M.D. Solomon E.I. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1992; 233: 198-200Google Scholar)). In the present study, we used plasma emission spectroscopy to test for zinc in the Cu-freeH. polymorpha amine oxidase samples, finding a significant level (∼57%, Table I) of zinc-bound protein. Since all efforts to reconstitute H. polymorpha amine oxidase activity by addition of copper to crude cell extracts were unsuccessful, we concluded that zinc incorporation had occurred during protein production in S. cerevisiae. Subsequent alteration of zinc levels in the growth media was carried out in an effort to obtain zinc-free enzyme. These experiments showed a more critical dependence on zinc than copper for growth of S. cerevisiae. While the yeast was not compromised when copper was depleted in the media, growth was minimal when zinc was present at 1:200 of the normal concentration in the culture medium. The yeast required the presence of ≥ 10% of the normal zinc concentration, as defined in the yeast nitrogen base (11Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar), to show some healthy growth. Only when zinc was 20% or more of the normal level did the optical density of the overnight culture approach that produced in the normal culture media (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32039-32042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the essential role for zinc in the growth ofS. cerevisiae, it has not been possible to study a form ofH. polymorpha amine oxidase obtained from S. cerevisiae grown on a medium severely depleted in both copper and zinc. However, as shown in Table I, either a reduction of the zinc concentration in the medium to 20% of the normal level or an increase in zinc to 10 times its normal level had little effect on the binding of zinc by the H. polymorpha amine oxidase. Although zinc homeostasis has not been examined in any detail in S. cerevisiae, we consider it unlikely that these changes in extracellular zinc levels had any impact on the intracellular zinc concentration. As controls, the zinc content was also analyzed for the wild-typeH. polymorpha amine oxidase and for a mutant with reduced copper binding (H456D), indicating levels of 16 and 8% of the subunit concentration, respectively (Table I). The failure of H456D to bind either zinc or copper at a significant level argues that zinc is binding to the copper site, as opposed to a second, adventitious site. Our inability to reconstitute the Cu-free H. polymorphaenzyme is thus attributed to pre-binding of zinc in vivo, which prevents the in vitro incorporation of copper and the formation of TPQ. The two prokaryotic amine oxidases that have been reconstituted in vitro from inactive precursors have each been expressed in E. coli (8Matsuzaki R. Fukui T. Sato H. Ozaki Y. Tanizawa K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Choi Y.-H. Matsuzaki R. Fukui T. Shimizu E. Yorifuji T. Sato H. Ozaki Y. Tanizawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4712-4720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the observed zinc incorporation into the H. polymorpha amine oxidase was enzyme- or expression host-specific, an E. coli expression system was developed for the H. polymorpha amine oxidase. Cells were transformed with pKW3, and exogenous protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG (in M9ZB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin medium not depleted in copper). SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the crude cell lysate showed a new protein band with a molecular mass of 76 kDa, as expected for H. polymorpha amine oxidase. Purification of this 76-kDa species based on the method developed for H. polymorpha amine oxidase expressed in S. cerevisiae yielded a protein >90% homogeneous, as judged on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, with a specific activity for benzylamine of 0.013 units/mg at 37 °C. This specific activity is approximately 10% of that reported for the fully active yeast amine oxidase expressed in S. cerevisiae (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Metal analysis revealed copper and zinc contents of 0.13 and 0.07 mol/mol enzyme subunit, respectively. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified product gave the sequence NH2-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-Arg-Pro. This corresponds to theH. polymorpha amine oxidase sequence commencing at residue 16 (13Bruinenberg P.G. Evers M. Waterham H.R. Kuipers J. Arnberg A.C. AB G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1008: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and indicates that the fMet plus 3 additional residues are removed from the N terminus of the recombinant protein during expression or purification. Thus, the H. polymorpha amine oxidase expressed in E. coli is a single residue longer than the processed enzyme recovered from S. cerevisiae (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar,7Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32039-32042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli cells expressingH. polymorpha amine oxidase were then cultured in copper-depleted medium and the recombinant protein purified in the presence of copper chelators. Despite a yield for purified protein (3 mg/liter of cell culture) similar to that seen for enzyme from S. cerevisiae, the resulting protein from E. coli had less than 0.01 mol copper/mol enzyme subunit and less than 1% of the specific activity of the fully active enzyme expressed in S. cerevisiae. Zinc content was also less than 0.01 mol/mol enzyme, and the protein did not react with phenylhydrazine to give the chromophore at 450 nm, characteristic of TPQ (19Janes S.M. Mu D. Wemmer D. Smith A.J. Kaur S. Maltby D. Burlingame A.L. Klinman J.P. Science. 1990; 248: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). To test whether the protein could be reconstituted to active enzyme, stoichiometric CuCl2 was added and the mixtures incubated in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, at 30 °C. At 40 μm protein subunit and copper after 2-h incubation, the enzyme typically had a specific activity of 0.05 unit/mg and the characteristic spectrum of topa quinone (Fig. 1 B). With prolonged incubation at 4 °C (3 weeks), a specific activity of 0.066 unit/mg was obtained; this can be compared with a specific activity of 0.13 unit/mg for holo-enzyme produced in vivo in yeast. Reaction of this product with phenylhydrazine yielded 0.6 mol phenylhydrazone/mol enzyme subunit, using an extinction coefficient of 40.5 mm−1 cm−1 at 448 nm calculated for the phenylhydrazone adduct of the S. cerevisiae-expressed H. polymorpha amine oxidase (5Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7653-7674Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Incubation of the E. coli-expressed H. polymorphaamine oxidase with both copper and zinc added at various times was conducted to investigate the origin of the observations made inS. cerevisiae expression. As shown, topa biogenesis is dependent on the order of metal addition (Table II). Incubation with zinc prior to copper inhibits the reconstitution reaction, although some activity (3%) can be seen following addition of copper up to 1 h. In the reciprocal experiment, incubation with zinc subsequent to copper-induced biogenesis may lead to a very slight reduction in active enzyme. Overall, the data in Table II confirm the observations first seen with expression in S. cerevisiae,i.e. that zinc binds tightly to the H. polymorphaamine oxidase and that copper and zinc are in competition for a single site.Table IIIn vitro reconstitution of E. coli-expressed yeast methylamine oxidase precursor following incubation with copper and zincIncubation2-aThe final composition of each enzyme solution was 43 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 19 μm protein, 19 μm CuCl2, and 19 μm ZnSO4.

Open table in a new tab We have shown that expression of H. polymorpha amine oxidase in copper-depleted S. cerevisiae leads to a protein that is enriched in Zn2+and is incompetent toward Cu2+-induced biogenesis of topa quinone. By contrast, expression of the H. polymorpha gene in copper-depleted E. coli produces a metal-free apoprotein. The differential behavior of S. cerevisiae and E. coli, with regard to insertion of zinc into an empty copper site, may reflect intrinsic differences between the two organisms in the cellular pathway for metalloprotein assembly, or it may reflect a lower availability of intracellular zinc levels in E. coli. The apo-form of H. polymorpha amine oxidase appears to have an unusually high avidity for zinc. Importantly, addition of copper alone to the apo-form of this eukaryotic amine oxidase leads to cofactor biogenesis at a level approximately 50% of that seen with recombinant protein isolated from S. cerevisiae. This indicates that oxidative activation of the precursor tyrosine (3Mu D. Janes S.M. Smith A.J. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7979-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) occurs in the absence of an exogenous source of reducing equivalents. Although the initial studies of topa quinone biogenesis in the prokaryotic system were carried out in the presence of dithiothreitol, recent studies indicate that biogenesis proceeds when this reducing agent has been removed (20Ruggiero C.E. Smith J.A. Tanizawa K. Dooley D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ability of copper to initiate tyrosine oxidation in the absence of an external electron source contrasts with other well characterized copper-dependent enzymes such as dopamine β-monooxygenase (21Klinman J.P. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2541-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) and tyrosinase (22Solomon E.I. Sundaram V.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). Although unprecedented thus far in enzymology, one possible mechanism for cofactor biogenesis in copper amine oxidases would involve an oxidation of the precursor tyrosine to a tyrosyl radical, concomitant with the conversion of active site Cu2+ → Cu1+ (cf. Refs.20Ruggiero C.E. Smith J.A. Tanizawa K. Dooley D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 23Fontecave M. Eklund H.

Efforts are currently under way to detect and characterize the reactive intermediates along the topa quinone biogenetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2012593791,"We are investigating the folding of the 81-residue recombinant dimeric DNA binding domain of the E2 protein from human papillomavirus and how it is coupled to the binding of its DNA ligand. Modifications in buffer composition, such as ionic strength and phosphate, cause an ∼5.0 kcal mol−1stabilization of the domain to urea unfolding, based on very similar conformational changes as measured by far UV circular dichroism. Binding of DNA produces an even greater stabilization, magnitude similar to that caused by the nonspecific polymer ligand heparin, which shifts the urea midpoint 2.5-fold. The DNA-bound complex displays substantial changes similar to those caused by ionic strength and phosphate in terms of overall secondary structure. Bis-8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate provides a very sensitive conformational probe, which shows alterations in the domain caused by the above mentioned compounds. In general terms, binding of DNA involves an overall conformational readjustment in the protein but maintains the β-barrel scaffold intact. This conformational plasticity seems to be of importance in the regulatory functions of this type of DNA-binding protein. The extremely long half-life of the E2-DNA complex, together with its very high stability, suggests that, in the absence of other factors that may affect its stability in vivo, the possibility of dissociation once formed is restricted.

Molecular interaction between proteins and DNA play a central role in the regulation of gene function in the biological world. DNA-binding proteins interact with specific target sequences in the DNA, and the basis for the recognition process at the molecular level has been the focus of intense research (1von Hippel P.H. Science. 1994; 263: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Often, the interaction leads to substantial changes in the conformation of both the nucleic acid and the protein, compared with their free forms, with direct implications for their function (2Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 3Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J.

Biol. 1996; 3: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The formation of a protein-DNA complex yields a new and different thermodynamic and structural entity; both processes, DNA binding and conformational changes in the free forms of both macromolecular partners, are highly coupled. This is more dramatic in the case of dimeric transcription factors with intertwined folding topologies such that their dissociated monomers are unfolded, and the process of folding and association and DNA binding are tightly linked (5Brown B.M. Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11189-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Harrison S.C. Aggarwal A.K. Annu. Rev.

Thus, DNA-binding domains may undergo local and global folding processes upon binding to their operator sequences. The E2 transcriptional activator of the human papillomavirus regulates the expression of most viral transcripts and participates in the DNA replication process. The protein consists of a C-terminal DNA-binding and dimerization domain (E2-DBD) 1The abbreviations used are: E2-DBD, E2 DNA binding domain; bis-ANS, bis-8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate; HPV, human papillomavirus; BPV, bovine papillomavirus; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. and an N-terminal transactivation domain, separated by a flexible region (8McBride A.A. Romanczuk H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18411-18414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E2-DBD is an ∼80-residue per monomer domain that can be overexpressed recombinantly in bacteria as a stable and soluble dimer (9Sanders C.M. Maitland N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4890-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Mok Y.-K. Prat Gay G.de Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Its biological importance is shown by the three forms of the protein produced by alternative splicing: the full-length protein (E2-TA), which acts as a transcriptional activator, and two shorter forms (E2-TR and E2/E8) produced from alternative splicing, acting as repressors (11Howley P.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Papillomaviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication. Lippincott-Raven Press, Philadelphia1996: 2045-2076Google Scholar). All forms have in common the entire C-terminal DNA binding domain. The structure of a homologous E2-DBD from the bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) bound to its DNA target was determined by x-ray crystallography and established a new folding topology, the dimeric β-barrel (12Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This particular fold is shared by the EBNA1 protein from the Epstein-Barr virus, the crystallographic structures of free and DNA-bound forms were recently described (13Bochkarev A. Barwell J.A.

Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The NMR solution structure of the highly homologous HPV E2-DBD (strain 31) domain free in solution showed a complete conservation of the overall fold of the BPV protein (15Liang H. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Yoon H.S. Egan D. Walter A.K. Holzman T.F. Robins T. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The HPV-16 E2-DBD was shown to undergo a concomitant dissociation and unfolding following an apparent two-state model, with folded dimers or unfolded monomers, and no intermediates accumulated (10Mok Y.-K. Prat Gay G.de Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A highly populated transient intermediate was found on its kinetic folding pathway, possibly of non-native characteristics (16Mok Y.-K. Bycroft M. Prat-Gay G.de Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To approach the problem of coupling between folding and DNA binding processes, in the present work we tackle the analysis of the effect of an oligonucleotide comprising its DNA target and other ligand, such as heparin, on the stability and conformation of the domain. We evaluate the effect of ionic strength and phosphate anions and discuss the relationship between conformational changes and stabilization in the effectors studied. For the analysis of stability and conformation we use fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, and we probe conformational changes making use of the hydrophobic dye bis-ANS. All reagents and buffers used were of maximal purity available. Water was twice distilled and deionized prior to use. Urea and heparin were purchased from Sigma and bis-ANS from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The recombinant E2-DBD from HPV-16 was overexpressed and purified as described previously (10Mok Y.-K. Prat Gay G.de Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured using the extinction coefficient of 41,900m−1 cm−1, determined from model compounds (17Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar), in very good agreement with the colorimetric method that we used in previous work (10Mok Y.-K. Prat Gay G.de Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We used a synthetic highly palindromic oligonucleotide of 36 base pairs with the following consensus sequence: 5′ TTTGTAGCTTCAACCGAATTCGGTTGCATGCT TTTT 3′, and the complementary strand (recognition sequence is underlined). Extra bases were included at each side of the consensus sequence to stabilize it further. For the annealing, we mixed equimolar concentrations of the complementary strands in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, heated at 90 °C for 10 min, and cooled slowly to ∼30 °C. As a source of soluble heparin, we used the porcine intestinal mucosa glycosaminoglycan (M r∼3,000). We made a concentrated stock solution in water and used it for the experiments. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a Hitachi F4500 spectrofluorometer. For high quality spectra, we accumulated 10 spectra using the software provided by the manufacturer. These spectra were used for the derivative analysis, unsmoothed data were derived successively (stepwise) up to the fourth derivative. In all cases, the buffer plus added compound base line was subtracted, and the temperature was tightly controlled at 25 °C. The base-line subtraction minimizes the contribution of the Raman peak, which nevertheless occurs below 320 nm, out of the range of the analysis of our spectra. Excitation wavelength was at 280 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded from 300 to 450 nm. Urea equilibrium denaturation was carried out in 50 mmBis-Tris, pH 7.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol unless otherwise stated. The temperature in all experiments was 25 °C, and protein/denaturant solutions were pre-equilibrated at that temperature for 2 h before measurements. In these experiments, fluorescence spectra were recorded on an ISS K2 spectrofluorometer (Champaign, IL) with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and emission scanned from 300 to 450 nm. The fluorescence spectra at urea concentration “u” were quantified by specifying the center of spectral mass <νu> (Equation 1),〈vu〉−ΣviFi/ΣFiEquation 1 where F i indicates the fluorescence emitted at wave number ν i, and the summation is carried out over the range of appreciable values of F. We observed that following fluorescence intensity at a fixed point is extremely sensitive to small changes in temperature, pH, or ionic strength, most likely due to an exposed tryptophan (Trp-56) in E2-DBD, located facing the solvent in the minor α-helix (Fig. 1). Since we want to compare different conditions, in the present work we follow the center of spectral mass that will report only changes on the environment of the two tryptophan residues located at the center of the barrel, which constitutes the dimeric interface. In this manner, we eliminate changes in fluorescence quantum yield at small changes in denaturant concentration, ionic strength, or temperature. The quantum yield of E2-DBD is increased by 30% at urea concentrations lower than 0.2 m (not shown); however, the center of mass is not affected. This takes place in a range in which there is no major unfolding, and it is most likely due to the exposed Trp residue. The unfolding parameters obtained using the center of mass are in excellent agreement with those previously obtained (see bottom of Table I). The analysis of the unfolding curves was carried out using a two-state model that considers protein concentration and was described previously in detail (10Mok Y.-K. Prat Gay G.de Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ΔG values obtained correspond to standard free energy changes.Table IEffect of salt, phosphate, heparin, and DNA on the fluorescence spectra and conformational stability of E2-DBDSpectral areaλmaxDifference in center of mass[Urea]50%ΔG unlm%nmcm −1mkcal mol −1m −1 kcal mol −1Buffer10034702.212.5 ± 0.72.0 ± 0.3NaCl86347144.917.5 ± 0.81.9 ± 0.2Phosphate93347194.316.9 ± 0.62.0 ± 0.1Heparin104345477.2DNA oligonucleotide82345777.0 Open table in a new tab CD spectra were obtained with a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter, using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Spectra were the average of 5 scans at a 50 nm/min speed, and the buffer base lines were subtracted. Only the far UV region from 200 to 260 nm was analyzed, due to increased noise at shorter wavelengths. Bis-ANS binding was performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, and 1 mmdithiothreitol unless otherwise stated. Fluorescence measurements were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was set at 360 nm, and the emission was measured from 400 to 600 nm. The titrations were performed by adding small amounts of a concentrated solution of bis-ANS to a fixed amount of E2-DBD and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min prior to the measurements. There were no time-dependent changes in fluorescence spectra between 5 and 60 min. The same procedure was applied when titrating with increasing concentrations of protein. In all cases, maximal dilution was 10%, and the data were corrected accordingly. Maximum emission wavelengths were calculated from the first derivative of the spectra. The structure of the first described E2-DBD from BPV-1 consists of a dimeric 8-stranded β-barrel with 4 strands of each monomer forming the interface, and two α-helices making cross-over contacts on the outside of the barrel (12Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The majority of the two helices in E2-DBD is the portion of the protein that binds the palindromic DNA target ACCG-N4-CGGT (Fig. 1). The solution structure of the highly homologous E2-DBD of HPV-31 shows an identical topology to the bovine virus protein (15Liang H. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Yoon H.S. Egan D. Walter A.K. Holzman T.F. Robins T. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The outer strands of the monomers are connected by a hydrogen bonding network, and many hydrophobic side chains protrude to the interior of the barrel. In HPV-16 E2-DBD, as in HPV-31, two tryptophan residues separated by a histidine (residues 34–36) are stacked and interacting, and face inward in the central cavity of the barrel (15Liang H. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Yoon H.S. Egan D. Walter A.K. Holzman T.F. Robins T. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and are most likely responsible for the fluorescence changes that take place upon denaturation/dissociation. Another tryptophan residue is located in the minor helix, facing the solvent. The amino acid sequence of E2-DBD from HPV-16 is 80% homologous to the HPV-31 domain. Tryptophan fluorescence was used as a first approach to investigate conformational changes and stability of the E2 domain. The fluorescence spectrum of E2-DBD at pH 7.0 without any addition is shown in Fig. 2 a (inset). We are interested in the study of the effect of compounds such as ionic strength, phosphate, heparin, and the specific DNA oligonucleotide on the conformation and stability of E2-DBD. Among other parameters in the cellular environment, ionic strength may affect the proteins that bind DNA, since these often present a large number of positively charged residues exposed to the solvent. Modifications in ionic strength also constitute a tool to investigate the contribution of the types of interactions that stabilize specific local or global conformations of a particular protein fold. We analyzed the effect of NaCl on the fluorescence spectra of folded E2-DBD. There is a small decrease in the area of the spectrum, but the center of spectral mass and the wavelength maximum remain virtually unchanged (Table I). This suggests that if there was a significant conformational change it does not seem to involve the exposure of the Trp residues of the interface to the solvent and, therefore, no disruption of the dimeric interface or major unfolding. Upon addition of phosphate anion, the fluorescence spectrum shows a minimal change in spectral area, with no apparent changes on its center of spectral mass or wavelength maximum (Table I). The interaction of the E2-DBD with its DNA target and the changes induced are crucial for understanding the basis of the molecular mechanism for the action of this transcription factor. For this purpose, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a consensus binding site was incubated with the domain, and a 20% change in the fluorescence spectral area and a small blue shift was observed (TableI). Any significant conformational change does not seem to involve major changes in the tryptophan residues at the interior of the domain. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is a heteropolymer composed of amino sugar disaccharide units. These type of polymers are highly negatively charged due to the presence of either carboxyl or sulfate groups on the sugar units, which repel each other and cause the polymer to adopt extended conformations. Immobilized heparin is frequently used as the method of choice for purification of nucleic acid binding proteins. In the case of E2-DBD, the protein binds to the heparin-modified matrix and is released only with concentrations higher than 1 msalt (10Mok Y.-K. Prat Gay G.de Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This prompted us to study the binding of soluble heparin and to analyze possible effects on the conformation and stability of the folded dimer. Adding heparin to folded E2-DBD led to a 2-nm blue shift in the fluorescence spectra, with no change in the fluorescence intensity. The possibility to obtain high quality fluorescence spectra allows us to approach a derivative analysis to discriminate different contributions in the spectrum, extending the sensitivity of the technique. A discrete number of bands can be resolved by this procedure, which originates in the transitions of electrons from the excited singlet state returning to different vibrational levels in the ground state (18Butler W.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Plotkin B.J. Sherman W.V. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5353-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using N-acetyl tryptophanamide as a model compound, three sharp bands were observed in the fourth derivative, at 326, 346, and 364 nm, respectively (20Restall C.J. Coke M. Phillips E. Chapman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In that study it was shown that the shift in emission maximum with change in the polarity of the environment is the result of changes in the relative contribution of these bands. The fourth derivative of the fluorescence spectrum of folded E2-DBD is shown in Fig. 2 a; the bands are broader than model compounds, and this is due to the different tryptophan residues present whose contributions overlap. Two distinctive wavelength maxima are observed at 332 and 342 nm and a third one at 365 nm. Addition of NaCl and phosphate produced a similar effect, an increase in the band at 332 nm and a decrease at 342 nm (Fig. 2 b). Addition of heparin shows a large increase at 342 nm and a decrease at 332 nm (Fig. 2 c). The band at 365 nm does not change in most conditions tested. The E2-DBD·DNA complex shows very little change in the intensity of the peaks, but a small red shift in the 342 nm peak is observed. The band at 365 nm changes slightly, and a small band around 375 nm is also evident in the complex. However, it is not possible to assign these marginal changes to alterations in the conformation at this stage. The E2-DBD from human papillomavirus strain 16 showed concerted denaturation and dissociation processes induced by urea (10Mok Y.-K. Prat Gay G.de Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We intend to compare the stability of E2-DBD to urea unfolding with addition of salts, phosphate, or its DNA ligand in similar conditions of pH. Fig. 3 shows a urea unfolding curve at pH 7.0 in which changes in the center of spectral mass are followed (see “Experimental Procedures”). The change in the center of mass upon complete unfolding is ∼800 cm−1, corresponding to a ∼10-nm red shift. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence spectra of folded and urea unfolded E2 domain, to illustrate the total change. For the analysis of the effect of ionic strength on the stability of the domain, we chose the urea concentration that causes near 100% unfolding of E2-DBD (Fig. 3). At 3.0 m denaturant, increasing the salt concentration generates a change in the center of spectral mass, indicative of a recovery of the folded conformation (∼29,000 cm−1). Fig. 4 a shows that the maximal recovery takes place between 0.5 and 1.0 mNaCl, similar concentrations have a negligible effect on the center of spectral mass of the folded conformation (Table I). Since the binding site of E2-DBD and other DNA-binding proteins contains a large proportion of positively charged residues, and being DNA a polyphosphate polymer, we wanted to test the effect of phosphate on the conformation and stabilization of the native fold. In Fig.4 b, following the procedure of addition of increasing amounts of the anion to unfolded E2-DBD in 3.0 m urea, we observed a recovery of the spectral properties of the folded conformation, indicating a stabilization with a maximal effect at concentrations higher than 50 mm phosphate. To estimate the stabilization effect of salts and phosphate we carried out urea denaturation experiments, and the stabilization observed is quite pronounced (Fig. 5). Using a two-state approach as described previously, we obtained a ΔG unf, the free energy change on unfolding, of 17.5 and 16.9 kcal mol−1 for NaCl and phosphate (10Mok Y.-K. Prat Gay G.de Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This corresponds to a stabilization (ΔΔG unf) of 5.0 and 4.5 kcal mol−1 for the same compounds. The [U]50%, the urea midpoint, was 4.9 m for NaCl and 4.3 mfor phosphate, and the m values, the parameter that measures the cooperativity of the transition, agree very well with the E2-DBD in buffer only (Table I), suggesting that the mechanism of unfolding at equilibrium is not altered. Effects of DNA on the stability were evaluated by adding increasing concentrations of the oligonucleotide to urea unfolded E2-DBD. Similar to what occurs in the presence of NaCl and phosphate, the DNA is able to fully recover the center of mass of the fluorescence spectrum of the domain, indicative of a folded conformation (Fig. 4 c). When unfolded E2-DBD (in 3.0 m urea) was titrated with increasing concentrations of heparin, the center of spectral mass showed a recovery to values corresponding to the tryptophan probes in the folded conformation as in the case of DNA, phosphate, and NaCl (Fig. 4 d). The effect of DNA and heparin on the stability of the E2 domain can be best quantified in urea unfolding experiments, in comparison with the free E2-DBD. Fig. 5 shows the large stabilization caused by both polymer ligands to a similar extent. The [U]50% was determined to be 7.0 m for DNA and 7.2 m for heparin. A detailed mathematical analysis for calculating free energies is not possible since there are several equilibria involved. If we were to assume the unfolding E2-DBD as the only event, we could approximate the analysis to a two-state model and use a linear relationship between [U]50% and ΔG unf. The stabilization (ΔΔG unf) caused by DNA and heparin would, therefore, be ∼9.0 kcal mol−1. This is only useful for a gross estimation of the otherwise obvious stabilizing effect. The far UV CD spectrum of E2-DBD showed two minima at 210 and 224 nm and a maximum at 195 nm, all corresponding to α-helix contribution (10Mok Y.-K. Prat Gay G.de Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As previously pointed out, the ellipticity minima differ slightly from those observed in most α-helices (208 and 222 nm); a high β-sheet content may influence the spectra and also the fact that the major helix may not be fully formed in the free domain in solution (15Liang H. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Yoon H.S. Egan D. Walter A.K. Holzman T.F. Robins T. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since we want to investigate effects of NaCl, phosphate, DNA, and heparin on the conformation of E2-DBD, we added concentrations of the above mentioned compounds bearing the maximal effect on the stability toward urea unfolding (see Fig. 4). Sodium chloride concentrations of 0.75m produced a decrease in negative molar ellipticity ([Θ]MRW) to approximately half of its value at 210 nm; a much smaller change was observed at 224 nm (Fig.6 a and Table I). An increase of 8,000 deg cm2 dmol−1 in [Θ]MRW is observed at 200 nm; although it cannot be determined precisely, this could be due either to an increase in the maximum at 195 nm or a shift of the maximum to the red. It is, nonetheless, a considerable spectral change. Concentrations of 100 mm phosphate cause a decrease of negative [Θ]MRW at 210 nm similar to high salt, which uncovers further the minimum at 224 nm, corresponding to the α-helix. The change resembles very much that observed in the presence of NaCl except from the more pronounced change in [Θ]MRW at 224 nm in the case of phosphate (Fig. 6 a and TableII). Upon binding of the DNA target, a large spectral change also in the region of the minimum at 210 nm becomes evident. The spectrum of E2-DBD·DNA resembles that of the domain in high salt and is virtually identical to E2-DBD in phosphate. All three share the large increase in [Θ]MRW at 200 nm.Table IIEffect of salt, phosphate, heparin, and DNA on the conformation of E2-DBD as measured from circular dichroism and bis-ANS binding experimentsSpectral areaλmaxK 0.5202 nm[θ]MRW (deg·cm2 dmol−1) 210 nm224 nm%nmμmBuffer1004970.8−1236−70135629NaCl504970.511597−3563−5510Phosphate604980.662275−3319−4758Heparin734970.76−837−5955−5338DNA oligonucleotide384941.312435−3657−4783 Open table in a new tab The assignment of the conformational changes upon DNA binding to a particular type of structure and the extent of that change are not straightforward to interpret from the mere inspection of the far UV CD spectra, except in the case of pure helical proteins. E2-DBD has high β-sheet type structures, including antiparallel β-strands and β-hairpins, as well as many aromatic residues. All this structural heterogeneity precludes an accurate estimation of the precise structural change (21Borén K. Freskgård P.O. Carlsson U. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For example, a β-hairpin or a turn could translate into a positive band between 210 and 220 nm, and this cannot be discerned from a decrease in negative ellipticity that could correspond to helix local unfolding. What is clear is that the domain has a large flexibility in response to salts, phosphate, and ligands, leading possibly to generalized conformational changes. The difference between free and DNA-bound E2-DBD can also be visualized from comparing the sum of the spectra of free E2-DBD and DNA, with the spectrum of the complex (Fig. 6 b). As described in the earlier crystallographic studies of the bovine virus E2-DBD, the DNA binds in a particular bent conformation (12Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A conformational change in the DNA oligonucleotide is observed from the difference spectrum of the bound DNA in comparison to the free DNA, shown in the inset of Fig. 6 b. Soluble heparin was also analyzed for its ability to induce conformational changes since it is known to bind to the protein, and it was found to cause a large stabilization toward urea denaturation, described in previous sections. The presence of heparin concentrations similar to those causing maximal stabilization toward urea unfolding (Fig. 4) produces only a small change in the far UV CD spectrum, compared with DNA, phosphate, and salt. No change is observed around 200 nm, suggesting once more that changes in both regions,i.e. 210–224 and below 200 nm, are reporting the same type of structural modification (Fig. 6 a).

LTα is secreted as a homotrimer and signals through two TNF receptors of 55–60 kDa (TNFR60) or 75–80 kDa (TNFR80). LTα also assembles with LTβ into a membrane-anchored, heterotrimeric LTα1β2 complex that engages a distinct cognate receptor, the LTβ receptor (LTβR). To investigate the role of the LTα subunit in the function of the membrane LTα1β2 complex, gene transfer via baculovirus was used to assemble LTα and -β complexes in insect cells. LTα containing mutations at D50N or Y108F are secreted as homotrimers that fail to bind either TNF receptor and are functionally inactive in triggering cell death of the HT29 adenocarcinoma cell line. In contrast, these mutant LTα proteins retain the ability to co-assemble with LTβ into membrane-anchored LTα1β2 complexes that engage the LTβR and trigger the death of HT29 cells. Membrane-anchored LTβ expressed on the cell surface in absence of the LTα subunit binds the LTβR but is functionally inactive in the cell death assay. These results indicate that the TNF receptor-binding regions of the LTα subunit are not necessary for engagement of the LTβR, but the LTα subunit is required for the assembly of LTβ into a functional heteromeric ligand. The lymphotoxins (LT) α and β, members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytokine superfamily, are implicated as important regulators and developmental factors for the immune system. LTα is secreted as a homotrimer and signals through two TNF receptors of 55–60 kDa (TNFR60) or 75–80 kDa (TNFR80). LTα also assembles with LTβ into a membrane-anchored, heterotrimeric LTα1β2 complex that engages a distinct cognate receptor, the LTβ receptor (LTβR). To investigate the role of the LTα subunit in the function of the membrane LTα1β2 complex, gene transfer via baculovirus was used to assemble LTα and -β complexes in insect cells.

Pathways for Cytolysis. Springer-Verlag, Basel1995: 175-218Google Scholar). These cytokines also exist in soluble forms, although distinct mechanisms generate secreted and membrane-bound LTα and TNF. Secreted TNF is generated by proteolysis of the transmembrane protein (3Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Alderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T.

Unlike TNF, LTα also assembles with LTβ into heteromeric complexes and is consequently localized to the cell surface by the transmembrane domain of LTβ (6Androlewicz M.J. Browning J.L. Ware C.F. J.

Substantial evidence indicates that membrane LT exists in two trimeric forms with either an α1β2 or α2β1 stoichiometry (6Androlewicz M.J. Browning J.L. Ware C.F. J. Biol.

LTα and TNF both bind and signal through two receptors, the 55–60-kDa TNF receptor (TNFR60; CD120a or type 1) (9Loetscher H. Pan Y. Lahm H. Gentz R. Brockhaus M. Tabuchi H. Lesslauer W.

By contrast, the surface LTα1β2 complex binds a related but distinct receptor, termed LTβR, that does not bind either LTα or TNF, whereas both TNFRs bind the LTα2β1 heterotrimer (8Browning J.L.

The LTα1β2 complex is the most abundant form expressed by activated T cells (13Ware C.F. Crowe P.D. Grayson M.H. Androlewicz M.J. Browning J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3881-3888PubMed Google Scholar), and unlike TNF, it is not produced naturally in soluble form (8Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam-ek A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N. Miatkowski K.

The existence of a LTβ homotrimer is uncertain, since LTβ protein is apparently always associated with LTα in T cells, and a direct assessment has been hindered by unsuccessful attempts at stable expression of membrane-bound LTβ in mammalian cells (8Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam-ek A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N. Miatkowski K. Zafari M. Yampaglia A.M. Lawton P. Meier W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 33-46PubMed Google Scholar). In tissue culture systems, TNF and LTα homotrimers are well recognized for their abilities to elicit a similar but not identical spectrum of cellular responses, including apoptosis and proinflammatory activities (14Tracey K.J.

Here, we employ recombinant baculovirus to reconstitute LTα and LTβ homo- and heteromeric complexes in insect cells to investigate the roles of the LTα and LTβ subunits in activation of the cell death response in tumor cells. Using two loss of function mutations in LTα (32Goh C.R. Loh C.S. Porter A.G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), aspartic acid 50 to asparagine (D50N) and tyrosine 108 to phenylalanine (Y108F), we show that these LTα mutant proteins co-assemble with LTβ to form a ligand that binds LTβR but not TNFR. The membrane-bound mutant LTα·LTβ complexes, but not the secreted homotrimers, are active at inducing death of the HT29 colon carcinoma cell line. By contrast, LTβ when expressed alone as a membrane protein binds the LTβR but is functionally inactive in inducing cell death. These results demonstrate that the LTα subunit is necessary for the LTα1β2 complex to activate the LTβR cell death pathway. The insect cell line BTI Tn5B1–4 (Tn5B1–4), kindly provided by JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS), was cultured at 27 °C in ExCell 401 serum-free medium containing 10 μg/ml gentamycin. The human adenocarcinoma cell line, HT29.14S, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, 100 μg/ml) (16Browning J.L.

After restriction with BamHI, the LTβ cDNA was ligated into the baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1393. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced by coinfection of pVL1393/LTβ with baculovirus DNA as described (34Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L. Walter B.N. Dahms K.M. Ware C.F. J. Immunol.

Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) lack the LTα signal sequence required for export; therefore, a 300-base pairNsi1/Pfl M1 cassette, containing the Y108F or D50N mutation, was isolated from p8/3 and p11A/20, respectively, and then used to replace the corresponding region in wild-type LTα. The resulting mutant cDNAs containing the LTα signal sequence were isolated as NotI fragments and ligated into pVL1393. The mutant constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis of the baculovirus vector (U.S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit). Recombinant baculoviruses containing LTαY108F and LTαD50N were generated as described for wild-type LTα (34Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L. Walter B.N. Dahms K.M. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 168: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At 6 days post-infection, supernatants from Tn5B1–4 insect cells infected with LTα, LTαY108F, or LTαD50N recombinant baculovirus were harvested and clarified by centrifugation; protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.8 mg/ml benzamidine HCl) and fetal bovine serum (10%) were added before dialysis against Hanks' balanced salt solution. The supernatants were filter-sterilized before testing in cytotoxicity assays. The concentration of LTα was determined by competitive radioimmunoassay using the anti-LTα mAbs NC2 and125I-LTα. Anti-LTα NC2 was bound (50 ng/well) to plastic snap wells (Immulon 2, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) precoated with goat anti-mouse Ig (500 ng/well) to capture 125I-LTα. The standard curve was generated with purified recombinant LTα (33Browning J. Ribolini A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1859-1867PubMed Google Scholar) diluted in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin with a 30-min binding interval. LTα was radioiodinated to a specific activity of 126 μCi/μg by the IodoGen method (36Markwell M.A. Fox C.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar).125I-LTα in 10 μl was added to a final concentration of 0.2 nm and allowed to bind for an additional 30 min. Each well was washed five times, and the bound 125I-LTα in individual wells was detected using a γ-counter. Each data point is the mean of duplicate wells from which the LTα concentration in supernatants was determined from the mean of four dilutions using the radioimmune assay template in Prism (GrapdPAD Software, San Diego, CA). The range was less than 5% for duplicate determinations. Receptor binding activity of LTα and mutant proteins was assessed using a solid phase competitive radioligand binding assay with TNFR60-Fc as a surrogate receptor. The format was identical to the radioimmunoassay described above except that purified TNFR60-Fc was bound at 50 ng/well to wells previously coated with goat anti-human Ig at 500 ng/well. Baculovirus-infected insect cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine as described (34Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L. Walter B.N. Dahms K.M. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 168: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after infection (multiplicity of infection was 10 at 105cells/cm2), the cells were washed with buffered saline and incubated in medium deficient in methionine for 2 h before adding [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine labeling mixture at 0.2 mCi/ml. After 20 h, the supernatants were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 23,000 × g, treated with protease inhibitors, and dialyzed against saline. Protein cross-linking was carried out by the addition of 10 μl of BSCOES, freshly dissolved in Me2SO at 100 mm, to 1.0 ml of serum-free culture supernatants from baculovirus-infected Tn5B1–4 cells (37Andrews J.S. Berger A.E. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2582-2591PubMed Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation on ice, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of glycine (1 m) and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below. The cellular fraction was extracted with Nonidet P-40 (1%) nonionic detergent in buffer with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm iodoacetamide and protease inhibitors. The detergent-soluble fraction, obtained after centrifugation, was subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (13Ware C.F. Crowe P.D. Grayson M.H. Androlewicz M.J. Browning J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3881-3888PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, detergent extracts were precleared by the addition of 10 μg of normal mouse or rabbit IgG and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads followed by the addition of 10 μg of either mouse anti-LTα or LTβ antibodies or polyclonal rabbit anti-LTα and protein G beads. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% acrylamide) and detected by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Tn5B1–4 cells were harvested, washed, and incubated on ice in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 10% bovine calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide containing the antibodies or TNFR-Fc chimeras at 10 μg/ml. Phycoerythrin-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse or anti-human IgG (5 μg/ml) was used to stain for mAb or TNFR-Fc, respectively. Controls for nonspecific binding included normal mouse or human IgG and inclusion in the buffer of human (or mouse) heat-aggregated IgG at 10 μg/ml to block nonspecific binding when staining for mouse IgG. Immunofluorescence staining was detected by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton-Dickenson) using forward and side scatter parameters to identify infected and noninfected cells. Each fluorescence histogram represents 1 × 104 events gated on infected cells. Fluorescence intensity = (mean fluorescent channel) × (percentage of positive fluorescent events), where a positive event has a fluorescence value >98% of the value for normal IgG. Specific fluorescence intensity represents the fluorescence intensity after subtraction of the value for normal IgG. Cytotoxicity of soluble LTα produced by insect cells was determined using a colorimetric assay with (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described (38Green L.M.

Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or murine L929 fibrosarcoma cells (104 cells/well in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates) were incubated in medium with serial dilutions of supernatants from infected insect cells. For HT29.14S cells, human interferon-γ was included in the medium at 80 units/ml. After 3 days of incubation, viable cells were detected by the addition of the MTT dye. Cytotoxicity assays with insect cells were performed using paraformaldehyde-fixed insect cells. Tn5B1–4 cells were infected with LTα and/or LTβ recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for each virus. After 2 days, Tn5B1–4 cells were harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 15 min on ice with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and then washed four times with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The fixed insect cells were added at various ratios to HT29.14S cells (104 cells/well) and incubated for 3 days, and viability was detected by reduced MTT dye. The percentage of cell viability was calculated as a ratio of the absorbance of reduced MTT dye at 570 nm for cytokine (or insect cell)-treated cells to the absorbance of dye by cells in medium (with interferon-γ) times 100. Each data point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate wells. The D50N and Y108F mutations in LTα were identified as cytotoxicity loss mutants that failed to bind to L929 cells (32Goh C.R. Loh C.S. Porter A.G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both LTαD50N and Y108F mutants, like wild type LTα, are secreted by Tn5B1–4 cells, typically to 20–40 μg/ml (34Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L. Walter B.N. Dahms K.M. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 168: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When treated with BSOCOES (1 mm), a homobifunctional protein cross-linking reagent, LTα and the two mutant proteins formed a ladder of three bands consistent with predicted sizes for trimers, dimers, and monomers of LTα (Fig.1 a). The ladder is created by the incomplete cross-linking of LTα subunits by BSCOES (37Andrews J.S. Berger A.E. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2582-2591PubMed Google Scholar). The less selective cross-linker glutaraldehyde (0.1%) forms a 65–70-kDa adduct in similar preparations (data not shown, and see Ref. 33Browning J. Ribolini A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1859-1867PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the majority of the LTα subunits exist as trimers. Both LTα mutants were ineffective as competitors for binding to TNFR60-Fc (K i = >700 nm) when compared with wild type LTα (K i = 10 nm) (Fig.1 b). Wild type LTα induces death in HT29 adenocarcinoma cells (IC50 = 100–200 pm), but both mutants were inactive when tested on HT29 cells (Fig. 1 c) or L929 cells (data not shown). The D50N and Y108F LTα mutants were tested for their ability to assemble into membrane LTαβ complexes by coinfection of Tn5B1–4 cells with recombinant LTβ baculovirus. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations with antibodies to individual α and β subunits were used to detect the formation of LTαβ complexes. Anti-LTα specifically immunoprecipitated major bands at 18, 21, and 22–23 kDa, consistent with precursor and glycosylated forms of LTα from baculovirus-infected Tn5B1–4 cells labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Fig.2, lanes 1–4). A band at 31–33 kDa expected for LTβ was also immunoprecipitated by anti-LTα. Similarly, anti-LTβ co-immunoprecipitated two major bands: LTα at 22–23 kDa and LTβ at 31–33 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 5–7). The LTα mutants associated with LTβ equally as well as wild type LTα as judged by the volume-density of the phosphor image. These results indicate that these mutations do not disrupt assembly of LTαβ heteromers. Also, note that LTβ is not associated with the secreted form of LTα (see Fig. 1 a), indicating that insect cells, like mammalian T lymphocytes, do not cleave LTβ. In the Tn5B1–4 cells, anti-LTβ primarily immunoprecipitated the 22–23-kDa mature form of LTα and not the smaller 18- and 21-kDa forms recognized by anti-LTα (Fig. 2, lanes 4–7). These two smaller LTα bands match reasonably well with the predicted sizes of the nascent and signal peptidase-cleaved LTα polypeptides of 22.2 and 18.6 kDa, respectively. LTα produced by insect cells is glycosylated (39Chai H. Vasudevan S.G. Porter A.G. Chua K.L. Oh S. Yap M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 18: 259-273PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that LTβ assembles with LTα soon after the initial processing steps. Precursor-product analysis of LTαβ synthesis in T-lymphocytes by pulse-chase methods revealed that LTβ initially associates with a 21–22-kDa LTα precursor that matures to a 25-kDa form (6Androlewicz M.J. Browning J.L. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2542-2547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam-ek A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N. Miatkowski K. Zafari M. Yampaglia A.M. Lawton P. Meier W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 33-46PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation (N- andO-linked) of LTα also occurs in mammalian cells (40Browning J.L. Androlewicz M.J. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1230-1237PubMed Google Scholar), although in T lymphocytes LTα shows more extensive change in molecular mass compared with the protein produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells (21 kDa). Tn5B1–4 cells singly infected with LTβ baculovirus express LTβ protein on the cell surface as detected by immunofluorescence staining with anti-LTβ, whereas anti-LTα did not stain (Fig.3, a and b). Surface expression of LTα requires infection with both LTα and LTβ recombinant baculoviruses (Fig. 3 c). The level of LTβ protein is approximately the same on both singly and coinfected cells, indicating that the presence of the LTα subunit does not"

A reaction scheme has been developed to model the sequence of steps necessary for the activation of RNase L (Cole, J. L., Carroll, S. S., Blue, E. S., Viscount, T., and Kuo, L. C. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19187–19192). The model comprises three sequential binding steps: the binding of activator to enzyme monomer, the subsequent dimerization of the activated monomer to form the active enzyme dimer, followed by the binding of substrate prior to catalysis. The model is used to evaluate the activation of RNase L by several synthetic analogs of the native activator. The 5′-phosphate of the activator has been determined to be an important structural determinant for the efficient activation of RNase L, and its loss caused a loss of activator affinity of 2–3 orders of magnitude. The length of activator is not an important determinant of activator potency for the activator analogs examined. The specific activity of the enzyme under conditions of saturation of activator binding and complete dimerization of the activated monomers varies only by about a factor of 3 for the activators examined, indicating that once dimerized in the presence of any of these activators, the enzyme exhibits a similar catalytic activity.

Interferons induce the expression of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases (1Hovanessian A.G. Brown R.E. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1977; 268: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), which, in the presence of double-stranded RNA, catalyze the formation from ATP of short oligomers of adenosine with 2′ to 5′ phosphodiester linkages. 2′,5′-oligoadenylates of three nucleotides in length or greater bind to and activate RNase L which can then degrade viral and cellular mRNAs, leading to an inhibition of protein synthesis in virally infected cells (2Hovanessian A.G.

RNase L activity has been shown to be an important antiviral defense mechanism. Overexpression of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase leads to the inhibition of picornavirus replication (4Chebath J.

The activation of RNase L on binding of 2′,5′-oligoadenylates is correlated with the dimerization of enzyme monomers. Dimerization has been detected with chemical cross-linking and gel filtration techniques (7Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and with the use of analytical ultracentrifugation (8Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol.

The extent of dimerization correlates with the fraction of activated enzyme, suggesting that most if not all of the enzymatic activity results from the dimeric form of the enzyme (8Cole J.L.

A quantitative description of the relationship among activator concentration, enzyme concentration, and enzymatic activity is required to make valid comparisons of the potency of activation by different analogs of the native activator, ppp-2′,5′-A3. 1The abbreviations used are: ppp-2′,5′-A3, a trimer of adenosines linked 2′ to 5′ with a 5′-triphosphate; p-2′,5′-A3, a trimer of adenosines linked 2′ to 5′ with a 5′-monophosphate; 2,5A, an oligomer of adenosine linked via 2′,5′-phosphodiester groups; AC50, concentration at which half-maximal activation is obtained under specified reaction conditions; HO-2′,5′-A3, a trimer of adenosines linked 2′ to 5′ with a 5′-hydroxyl; HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC, a conjugate of HO-2′,5′-A3–2′-NH2 and 7-hydroxycoumarin-3-carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester.

The activation of RNase L by analogs of the native activator is determined in terms of the activation model. Comparisons are made between the activation parameters as determined from the rates of the RNase L-catalyzed reactions in this work and the equilibrium measurements of the binding of the activator and the dimerization of enzyme monomers as detected with sedimentation equilibrium and fluorescence anisotropy in the accompanying report (9Cole J.L.

Biochemical Corp. [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. RNase L was expressed and purified as described previously (10Dong B. Xu L. Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Lee X.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4988-4992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The concentration of enzyme was determined with amino acid analysis or with absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 84,000 m−1 cm−1(8Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Substrates C11UC8, C11U2C7, and C11U3C7 were prepared and quantified as described previously (11Carroll S.S. Chen E. Viscount T. Geib J. Sardana M.K. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4988-4992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The substrates were radiolabeled at the 5′-terminus with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase as described previously (11Carroll S.S. Chen E. Viscount T. Geib J. Sardana M.K. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4988-4992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Activators of RNase L were prepared synthetically via phosphoramidite chemistry either by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) or by NAPS GmbH (Goettingen, Germany). The activators were purified with reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on C18 columns (Vydac) using a gradient of acetonitrile in triethylammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.5. The concentrations of stock solutions of activators were determined by absorbance at 260 nm using extinction coefficients of 45,900 m−1cm−1 for trimeric activators and 61,200m−1 cm−1 for tetrameric activators. Reactions were initiated, unless otherwise indicated, by the addition of an aliquot of 10-fold concentrated substrate (5 μl) to a solution (45 μl) of enzyme which had been preincubated with activator at various concentrations for 20 min at 22 °C in reaction buffer (11.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 104 mm KCl, 5.8 mm magnesium acetate, 1.2 mm ATP, 0.2% polyethylene glycol, 8000 MW, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Under these conditions the enzyme was maximally activated, and enzyme activity was stable for at least 60 min. Reaction time courses were followed by quenching an aliquot (5 μl) of the reaction with an equal volume of electrophoresis gel load buffer containing 90% formamide and 10 mm EDTA. Substrates and products were separated with the use of denaturing 20% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels and were quantified with the use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Enzyme (0.3 nm in terms of enzyme monomers) was preincubated with different fixed concentrations of activator (1 nm–15 μm), and reaction rates were determined from reaction time courses as described. The rate of the reaction as a function of the activator concentration was fit to Equation 7 (below) with K d fixed at 3 nm, and K s fixed at 200 nmto determine an initial value for K a. After values for K d and K s were determined experimentally using the initial value for K a, the data were fit again to determine the final value forK a. The experimentally determined value forK d was then checked using the finalK a value. Enzyme (50 pm–8 nm in monomers) was preincubated with a near saturating concentration of activator using the initial value for K a determined as described above. Cleavage reactions were then initiated with the addition of substrate C11U2C7 to a final concentration of either 1.5 or 2.5 μm, and the rate of cleavage of the substrate was determined. The plot of specific activity versus [RNase L] was fit to Equation 7 (divided by the concentration of enzyme monomers to convert the units to those of the specific activity determination) using the initial value ofK a for the given activator and the value ofK s determined as described below to determine the value of the dimerization equilibrium constant, K d. The enzyme specific activity as a function of enzyme concentration was also determined in reactions containing enzyme monomers at concentrations from 0.5 to 20 nm in reactions including 2.5 μm C11UC8 as substrate. Reactions contained RNase L at a final concentration of 0.3 nm, either 4 or 500 nm p-2′,5′-A3 and from 50 to 1,500 nm C11U2C7 in enzyme reaction buffer. Reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate to preactivated enzyme as described. Reaction rate data were fit directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determinek cat and K m. The values forK i for substrate C11U2C7 and for substrate C11UC8 as inhibitors of the cleavage of substrate C11U3C7 were determined in reactions containing 0.3 nm RNase L and a near saturating concentration of activator in reaction buffer with 5′-32P-C11U3C7 as the radiolabeled substrate at final concentrations of 125–600 nm. Reactions also contained either C11U2C7 (0–600 nm) or C11UC8 (0–1.8 μm). Reaction rate data were fit to a competitive mechanism. Replots of the slopes of the double-reciprocal plot were used to determine K i. Under these conditions, the competitive inhibition constant,K i, is equal to the binding constant for substrate,K s. The effect of the dilution of enzyme on the rate of subsequent RNA cleavage reactions was determined with preincubation of RNase L (1 nm) and p-2′,5′-A3(500 nm) in reaction buffer for 20 min. Reactions were then initiated by the addition of an aliquot (5 μl) of the preincubation solution in an RNA cleavage reaction (total volume 200 μl) such that the concentration of p-2′,5′-A3 was maintained at 500 nm, but the enzyme was diluted to 25 pm. Control reactions included preincubation of 27.5 pm RNase L and 500 nm p-2′,5′-A3 and initiation of the reaction by addition of substrate such that the enzyme concentration decreased only by 10%. Reaction time courses were monitored as described above. The effect of dilution of the concentration of activator on the rate of subsequent cleavage reaction was determined by preincubation of RNase L (20 nm) and p-2′,5′-A3(20 nm) in reaction buffer for 20 min followed by a 20-fold dilution into an RNA cleavage reaction such that the concentration of activator was either decreased 20-fold or was maintained at the same concentration as in the preincubation. Reaction time courses were then monitored. Control reactions in which the enzyme concentration was either diluted 20-fold or 1.1-fold to a final concentration of 1 nm did not display any difference in the rate of cleavage, indicating that no detectable reequilibration due to dilution of the enzyme occurred under these conditions. The equilibrium dissociation constants describing the three equilibria included in the model for activation of RNase L (Scheme I under “Results”) may be written as follows,Ka=[E][A]/[EA]or*[EA]=[E][A]/KaEquation 1 Kd=*EA*2/*E2A2*or**E2A2*=*EA*2/KdEquation 2 *Ks=[E2A2][S]/[E2A2·S]or*[E2A2·S]=[E2A2][S]/KsEquation 3 where E is enzyme monomer, A is activator,EA is enzyme with activator bound,E 2A2 is the active dimer with two activator molecules bound, S is the substrate, andE 2A2·S is the active dimer with substrate bound. The equation describing the total concentration of enzyme species is given by,*E*o=*E*+*EA*+2**E2A2*+2**E2A2·S*Equation 4 where [E]o is the original concentration of enzyme monomers, and [E] is the concentration of monomers at equilibrium. Rearranging Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 to solve for [EA], [E 2A2], and [E 2A2·S] and substituting into Equation 4 followed by rearrangement gives a quadratic equation in terms of [E]. A solution is reached when:*E*=*−b±*b2−4ac*0.5*/2aEquation 5 where: a is {2[A] / K a K d}{1 + [S] / K s}, b is {1 +K a / [A]}, and c is {−[E]o K a / [A]}. In practice only the positive operator in Equation 5 gives a physically meaningful result. The rate equation is determined by substituting Equation 5 into Equation 1 to yield a description of [EA] which may then be substituted into Equation 2 to give an equation describing [E 2A2]. The reaction rate will be proportional to the total concentration of dimeric species,v=2vo{[E2A2]+[E2A2·S]}=2vo{1+[S]/Ks}{[E2A2]}Equation 6 where v o is the specific activity of the activated dimeric enzyme under the defined reaction conditions written in terms of [E]o. Therefore the rate equation is:v=2voa1+[S*/Ksbaa*−b±*b2−4ac*0.5*/2aba*A*/Ka*bb2/KdEquation 7 with a, b, and c as described for Equation 5. Reaction rate data were fit to Equation 7 in which the concentration of active dimeric RNase L at equilibrium is expressed in terms of the initial concentration of enzyme monomers, the concentration of substrate, the concentration of activator in the reaction, and the equilibrium dissociation constants associated with the model of activation which is presented under “Results.” Fitting of the data to Equation 7 was carried out using the commercial fitting program, Kaleidagraph, which is based on the algorithm of Marquardt (12Marquardt D.M. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar). RNase L activity has been monitored by following the cleavage of radiolabeled synthetic oligoribonucleotides after separation of substrate and product on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, as described (11Carroll S.S. Chen E. Viscount T. Geib J. Sardana M.K. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4988-4992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The activation of RNase L by 2,5A analogs is allowed to reach equilibrium during a preincubation step that included activator and enzyme in reaction buffer at 22 °C for at least 20 min. Control reactions indicate that 20 min is a sufficient time to allow the association of activator and enzyme and the formation of enzyme dimers to reach equilibrium. The activity of the preactivated enzyme stock is stable for at least 60 min. Substrate is added to the enzyme-activator solution in a volume equal to 0.10 of the final reaction volume to initiate the reaction. Addition of the substrate in a small volume is designed to minimize the effect of volume increase on the equilibria of activator binding and enzyme dimerization. At low enzyme concentrations (<0.3 nm) after a 20-min preincubation with activator, a lag in the reaction time course is observed lasting ∼1 min followed by a linear phase. The lag in the time course is not evident at high enzyme concentrations (>1 nm). Longer preincubation times (up to 1 h) do not eliminate the lag phase at low enzyme concentrations. The lag is consistent with the binding of substrate to dimers which would serve to increase the concentration of enzyme dimers under low enzyme concentrations where a higher fraction of the enzyme exists as activated monomers. Care has been taken to measure reaction rates during the final linear phase of the reaction time course in reactions containing low concentrations of the enzyme. The reversibility of the activation process has been investigated with the use of dilution experiments. In one set of experiments, enzyme is preincubated with 20 nm p-2′,5′-A3. The concentrations of the enzyme and activator are then decreased 20-fold by dilution, and the reaction time course is monitored. The results shown in Fig. 1indicate that the activation of the enzyme is reversible as evidenced by a slow decrease in reaction rate after dilution of activator compared with a reaction in which the enzyme was diluted from 20 nm to 1 nm but the activator concentration remained at 20 nm. The observed rate of activity loss is 0.004 min−1, indicating a slow reequilibration under the conditions of the reaction. In another set of experiments enzyme is preactivated at a concentration that is 40-fold (1 nm) higher or at a concentration that was 1.1-fold (27.5 pm) higher than the final reaction concentration. A cleavage reaction is initiated by the addition of substrate to the preincubation containing enzyme at 27.5 pmor by the addition of an aliquot of the 40-fold concentrated enzyme solution to a reaction mixture. In each experiment the concentration of activator, p-2′,5′-A3, remains constant (500 nm). As shown in Fig. 2 the reaction in which enzyme is diluted 40-fold initially shows a higher rate than that of a reaction preincubated at 1.1-fold higher than the final concentration, but the rate then decreases to approximately the same rate as the reaction in which enzyme is diluted 1.1-fold, indicating that the specific activity of the enzyme decreases upon 40-fold dilution of the enzyme to a final concentration of 25 pm. The following model (Scheme I) has been developed as a basis for the quantitative description of the kinetics of catalysis by RNase L.E+A*⇌EA*KaEA+EA*⇌E2A2*KdE2A2+S*⇌E2A2·S*KsSCHEME*I E represents enzyme monomer, A is the activator,EA is the activated monomer,E 2A2 is the enzyme dimer, and S andE 2A2·S are substrate and the enzyme dimer-substrate complex, respectively (9Cole J.L.

K a represents the dissociation constant for activator binding to enzyme monomers, K d is the dissociation constant for enzyme dimers, and K s is the dissociation constant for substrate binding to enzyme dimers. The first two steps of this binding scheme represent a subset of the complete coupled ligand binding-enzyme dimerization scheme (13Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990: 203-212Google Scholar, 14Wong I. Lohman T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and are minimally required to explain the observed dependence of the reaction rate on both activator concentration and enzyme concentration. It is necessary to extend the model developed in the preceding paper (9Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Blue E.S. Viscount T. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19187-19192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) by including the binding of substrate because substrate binding influences the equilibrium concentrations of activated monomer (EA) and dimer (E 2A2). The model assumes that only activated dimer binds substrate. Under “Experimental Procedures,” a derivation is given of the rate equation (Equation 7) dictated by the model in terms of enzyme monomer concentration, activator concentration, substrate concentration, and the dissociation constants K a,K d, and K s. As shown in Fig.3, the rate of cleavage of the substrate C11U2C7 is saturable with increasing concentrations of p-2′,5′-A3. The concentration of p-2′,5′-A3 at which half-maximal activation is obtained (AC50) under the reaction conditions is 10 nm. A previous determination of AC50 for p-2′,5′-A3with preincubation of enzyme and activator at 0 °C was 1 nm, indicating a temperature dependence of AC50(11Carroll S.S. Chen E. Viscount T. Geib J. Sardana M.K. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4988-4992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The increase in the rate of the reaction with increasing concentrations of activator could be due to a change ink cat or K m or both. The value of K m for substrate C11U2C7 has been determined at a near saturating concentration of activator p-2′,5′-A3 (500 nm) and at a subsaturating concentration of p-2′,5′-A3 (4 nm). The K m values are 230 nm and 200 nm, respectively, indicating that the concentration of activator does not have a significant effect on the K m for substrate. Rate saturation data have been fit to Equation 7 to determineK a, the activator dissociation constant, by first fixing values for K d and K s to give an approximate value for K a. After determiningK d and K s using near saturating concentrations of activator based on the initial K a value, a true fit for the rate data with varying concentrations of activator is carried out to determine the value ofK a. A near saturating concentration of activator is included in the preincubation with enzyme at concentrations that vary over a wide range. Reaction time courses are subsequently measured. A plot of the enzyme specific activity as a function of the concentration of the enzyme in the reaction is shown in Fig. 4 for activation in the presence of 500 nm p-2′,5′-A3. The specific activity increases with increasing concentrations of enzyme and reaches a maximum, consistent with the dissociation of enzyme dimers at low enzyme concentrations. The plot of specific activity as a function of enzyme concentration has been fit to a modified form of Equation 7, dividing by the enzyme monomer concentration (to convert rate data to specific activity data), and using the value ofK a determined as described previously, to determineK d. The value ofK s for substrate C11U2C7 has been determined by measuring a K i for C11U2C7 as an alternate substrate-inhibitor of the cleavage of substrate C11U3C7 in reactions containing from 0 to 1,800 nmC11U2C7, from 125 to 600 nm C11U3C7 and a near saturating concentration of the activator. Reaction rate data are fit to a competitive mechanism, and the values for K s shown in Table I are determined from a replot of the slopes of the double-reciprocal plots. The values forK s shown in Table II for substrate C11UC8 as an alternate substrate inhibitor of the cleavage of substrate C11U3C7have been determined in a similar manner.Table IActivation parameters for analogs of 2,5AActivatorK a 1-aBinding constants as defined in Scheme I are determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”K d 1-aBinding constants as defined in Scheme I are determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”K s 1-aBinding constants as defined in Scheme I are determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Maximal specific activity1-bMaximal specific activity is defined as the specific activity under conditions of saturating concentrations of activator and complete dimerization at a given substrate concentration.nmnmnmmin −1ppp-2′,5′-A31.02250101p-2′,5′-A3112170140HO-2′,5′-A37,7005300121HO-2′,5′-A42106160107p-2′,5′-A46.67320131p-2′,5′-A515121-cAverage of two trials.1,0001501-cAverage of two trials.HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC8201.1500461-a Binding constants as defined in Scheme I are determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b Maximal specific activity is defined as the specific activity under conditions of saturating concentrations of activator and complete dimerization at a given substrate concentration.1-c Average of two trials.

The activation parameters K a and K d have been determined for the activators p-2′,5′-A3 and HO-2′,5′-A3 using C11UC8 as substrate in a manner similar to that used to determine the same parameters with substrate C11U2C7. As shown in Table II, the values of K a for the activators p-2′,5′-A3 and HO-2′,5′-A3 determined using C11UC8 as substrate are both ∼3-fold lower than the values of K a determined using C11U2C7 (Table I). The values forK d determined in reactions included C11UC8 (Table II) in the case of activation by p-2′,5′-A3 or by HO-2′,5′-A3 are 5-fold higher than the K d determined in reaction containing substrate C11U2C7 (Table I). The activation of RNase L by structural analogs of 2,5A has been analyzed according to Scheme I. The results are shown in Table I. The most potent activator of RNase L examined in this study is a synthetic version of the native activator, ppp-2′,5′-A3, which activates the enzyme with aK a of 1.1 nm. The least potent activator characterized is the HO-2′,5′-A3, with aK a of 7.7 μm. The values determined for the dimer dissociation constant, K d, also show variation depending on the structure of the activator, although theK d values show less variation than do theK a values. The values for K i which are equal to the equilibrium binding constant for the substrate,K s, are independent of the nature of the activator with the exception of activation by p-2′,5′-A5 which has a 4-fold increased K s. For 5′-monophosphate activators the optimal length in terms of the lowest value forK a is four adenosines with slight increases inK a for activation by the oligonucleotide with five adenosines. The maximal specific activity, the activity of the enzyme under conditions of saturating activator and complete dimerization, does not show a significant dependence on the structure of the activators shown in Table I, varying by 3-fold maximally. Reaction rate kinetics have been used to measure the kinetic parameters governing the activation of RNase L. A model for the activation of the enzyme was developed (9Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Blue E.S. Viscount T. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19187-19192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as the basis for the quantitative evaluation of activation by structural analogs of the native activator. The rates of cleavage reactions catalyzed by RNase L show saturation kinetics as a function of the concentration of the activator in the reaction (Fig. 3). The specific activity of the enzyme decreases at low concentrations of enzyme consistent with the dissociation of active enzyme dimers at low enzyme concentrations (Fig.4). Both the binding of activator and the dimerization of the enzyme are reversible processes as evidenced by a slow loss of activity on dilution of either the activator below K a or dilution of the enzyme to a concentration well belowK d. These observations are consistent with the proposed model for activation wherein enzyme monomers first bind activator to yield activated monomers, followed by dimerization of the monomers to give the active dimeric enzyme species (9Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Blue E.S. Viscount T. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19187-19192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Experimental support for the model comes from sedimentation equilibrium experiments, which fail to detect any dimerization of enzyme monomers in the absence of activator at concentrations up to 18 μm(8Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Further support for the proposal that the primary active species is the enzyme dimer comes from the observation that the extent of dimerization of the enzyme at high enzyme concentrations (greater thanK d) is a linear function of the stoichiometry of activator to enzyme monomers. Because the stoichiometry of dimerization closely parallels the stoichiometry of activation, most if not all of the enzyme activity results from the dimeric form of the enzyme (8Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The binding of substrate is included in the model for activation since substrate binding can influence the extent of dimerization by binding solely or preferentially to the dimer. The K i of the substrates used in reactions for determination of K a and K d as alternate substrates for the cleavage of the substrate C11U3C7 has been determined experimentally because the K i of the competitive inhibitor will be equivalent to the binding constant of the substrate K s. Prior activation conditions involved preincubation of enzyme and activator at 0 °C (11Carroll S.S. Chen E. Viscount T. Geib J. Sardana M.K. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4988-4992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because both K a andK d show a temperature dependence, preincubation at 0 °C gives a greater degree of dimerization and higher activity than does preincubation at the same concentrations of activator and enzyme at 22 °C, the conditions used in this work. Further support for a decrease in K a and K d with lower temperatures comes from sedimentation equilibrium measurements of enzyme dimerization (9Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Blue E.S. Viscount T. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19187-19192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A change in the structure of the activator can cause changes in the activation parameters. Three main conclusions may be drawn from the data presented in Table I. First, comparison of activation by ppp-2′,5′-A3 to activation by p-2′,5′-A3indicates that loss of the 5′-diphosphate causes a 10-fold increase inK a and only minor changes in K d and K s. Further loss of the 5′-phosphate in the case of HO-2′,5′-A3 causes another 700-fold increase inK a and minor increases in K d andK s, indicating that the 5′-phosphate moiety is an important determinant of the potency of activator binding. Second, the values of K a for the series of activators with a 5′-monophosphate and lengths 3, 4, or 5 adenosines show only minor variations, indicating that the length of these activators is not a strong determinant for potency of activation. However, addition of a fourth base in the 5′-OH analogs is associated with a significant decrease in K a, from 7.7 μm for the trimer to 210 nm for the tetrameric activator. Third, despite the greater than 3 orders of magnitude variation inK a, the maximal specific activity of the enzyme, under conditions of saturating concentrations of activator and complete dimerization, does not show a large dependence on the structure of the activator, indicating that once the enzyme has dimerized it retains a similar efficiency of catalysis. These values of K a are consistent with activator binding as determined with competitive binding affinity measurements. The binding constant of ppp-2′,5′-A3 with the murine enzyme has been reported variously as 40 pm (15Silverman R.H. Jung D.D. Nolan-Sorden N.L. Dieffenbach C.W. Kedar V.P. SenGupta D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7336-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 1 nm (16Knight M. Cayley P.J. Silverman R.H. Wreschner D.H. Gilbert C.S. Brown R.E. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1980; 288: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), with the differences probably being due to differences in experimental conditions and the inherent difficulties of measuring so tight a binding interaction. Competitive binding measurements with HO-2′,5′-A3 indicate a binding constant in the low micromolar range (17Kariko K. Li S. Sobol R.W. Suhadolnick R.J. Charubala R. Pfleiderer W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7136-7142Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a value consistent with theK a determined in this work using substrate C11UC8 (2.8 μm, Table II). The activation parameters K a, K d, and K s have been determined for activation by p-2′,5′-A3 and HO-2′,5′-A3 in reactions containing two different substrates, C11U2C7(k cat/K m = 1.9 × 107m−1 s−1) and C11UC8(k cat/K m = 8 × 105m−1 s−1). The value of K a for each activator decreases by about a factor of 3 in reactions containing the substrate C11UC8 relative to reactions with substrate C11U2C7 (Tables I and II). The values for K d determined with each activator also show a 5-fold increase in reactions containing substrate C11UC8 relative to the K d determined in reactions with the substrate C11U2C7. These changes inK a and K d with the sequence of the substrate may indicate that the binding of substrate produces an effect on the conformation of the enzyme such that the activation parameters are intrinsically changed slightly from those of the enzyme in the absence of substrate. Comparison of the K d determined by measurement of reaction kinetics with activation by HO-2′,5′-A3, for example (5 and 24 nm for reactions containing C11U2C7 and C11UC8, respectively), with theK d determined by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (17 nm; Ref. 9Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Blue E.S. Viscount T. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19187-19192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) supports the possibility of a decrease in K d in the presence of the better substrate, C11U2C7. The small change in the energy of binding (0.6–1 kcal/mol) for the activator with different substrates is not unreasonable. In general, a good agreement exists between the values forK a and K d as determined with enzyme kinetics for HO-2′,5′-A3 using substrate C11UC8 with K a andK d as determined with the use of sedimentation equilibrium methods (9Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Blue E.S. Viscount T. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19187-19192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The activation by a fluorescent analog of HO-2′,5′-A3, HO-2′,5′-A3-7HC, described in the previous paper, was also examined. The values for K a and K d as determined by examination of enzyme kinetics (0.8 μm, 1.1 nm, respectively, TableI) are in reasonable agreement with K a andK d as determined with fluorescence anisotropy (1.8 μm, 1.1 nm, respectively; Ref. 9Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Blue E.S. Viscount T. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19187-19192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The proposed model for the activation of RNase L takes into account the three equilibria that lead to the formation of the activated complex. The model should prove useful for the quantitative evaluation of the activation of RNase L by different activators."
https://openalex.org/W2057639582,"The enzymatic properties of Gap1m were characterized using three Ras and R-Ras proteins as substrates and were compared with those of p120GAP. Gap1m stimulated the GTPase of Ras better than that of R-Ras, in contrast to p120GAP which promoted the GTPase of R-Ras better than that of Ras. The EC50 values of Gap1m for Ha-Ras and R-Ras were 0.48 ± 0.02 and 1.13 ± 0.12 nm, respectively, whereas the EC50 values of p120GAP for Ha-Ras and R-Ras were 23.1 ± 1.9 and 3.86 ± 0.38 nm, respectively. The affinities of Gap1mand p120GAP to the substrates determined by competitive inhibition by using Ha-Ras·GTPγS (guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)) or R-Ras·GTPγS as a competitor agreed well with the substrate specificities of these GTPase-activating proteins. The K m values of Gap1m for Ha-Ras and R-Ras were 1.53 ± 0.27 and 3.38 ± 0.53 μm, respectively, which were lower than that of p120GAP for Ha-Ras (145 ± 11 μm) by almost 2 orders of magnitude. The high affinity of Gap1m to the substrates and its membrane localization suggest that Gap1mmay act as a regulator of the basal activity of Ha-Ras and R-Ras. The enzymatic properties of Gap1m were characterized using three Ras and R-Ras proteins as substrates and were compared with those of p120GAP. Gap1m stimulated the GTPase of Ras better than that of R-Ras, in contrast to p120GAP which promoted the GTPase of R-Ras better than that of Ras.

The high affinity of Gap1m to the substrates and its membrane localization suggest that Gap1mmay act as a regulator of the basal activity of Ha-Ras and R-Ras. Ras proteins (N-Ras, Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras) are three closely related members of the Ras family which act as a molecular switch for signal transduction pathways to control cell growth and differentiation (1Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like other guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, Ras cycles between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. The GDP-bound form is converted to the GTP-bound form through a GDP/GTP exchange reaction that is facilitated by guanine nucleotide-releasing factors (2Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). On the other hand the GTP-bound form is converted to the GDP-bound form by the intrinsic GTPase activity, which is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP(s), GTPase-activating protein(s); GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3thiotriphosphate). (3Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). R-Ras is a member of the Ras family proteins and is highly homologous to Ras (4Lowe D.G. Capon D.J. Delwart E. Sakaguchi A.Y. Naylor S.L. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1987; 48: 137-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Despite a high sequence similarity between Ras and R-Ras, R-Ras does not transform Rat1 fibroblastic cells (5Lowe D.G. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, recent results have demonstrated that the activated form of R-Ras transforms NIH 3T3 cells, and the transformant forms tumors in athymic nude mice (6Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar, 7Saez R. Chan A.M. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2977-2982PubMed Google Scholar). Since R-Ras has an effector binding domain the amino acid sequence of which is very similar to that of Ras, R-Ras binds to and activates the c-Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (6Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar, 8Spaargaren M. Martin G.A. McCormick F. Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Besides its roles in the stimulation of cell proliferation, R-Ras may play other roles in different cell biological processes. It is reported that R-Ras binds to Bcl-2, which is a key molecule controlling the process of apoptosis; however, the binding to Bcl-2 is not GTP-dependent (9Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It was also reported that R-Ras promotes apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation by a mechanism that is suppressed by overexpression of Bcl-2 (10Wang H.G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recently it has been described that R-Ras enhances cell adhesion to extracellular matrix substrates through the activation of integrins (11Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical mechanisms by which R-Ras activity is regulated are still to be clarified. Three mammalian GAPs for Ras have been identified so far. p120GAP, which was first described, is a prototype of this class of proteins (12McCormick F. Cell. 1989; 56: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Besides a catalytic domain that stimulates Ras GTPase, p120GAP has two SH2 (Src homology 2) domains, one SH3 domain, one PH (plekstrin homology) domain, and one phospholipid binding domain (13Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). The second is neurofibromin (NF1), a product of the neurofibromatosis type I gene (14Gutmann D.H. Collins F.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 335-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Neurofibromin has a region that shows a sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of p120GAP and Ira proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the domain was termed as a GAP-related domain. Indeed this region was shown to possess GAP activity for Ras and to suppress ira2 mutation (15Xu G.F. Lin B. Tanaka K. Dunn D. Wood D. Gesteland R. White R. Weiss R. Tamanoi F. Cell. 1990; 63: 835-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). We have isolated the third Ras GAP (Gap1m) which is a mammalian homolog of theDrosophila Gap1 gene (16Maekawa M. Li S. Iwamatsu A. Morishita T. Yokota K. Imai Y. Kohsaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6879-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to the GAP-related domain, Gap1m has two putative phospholipid binding domains and a region similar to the domain unique to Btk tyrosine kinase (16Maekawa M. Li S. Iwamatsu A. Morishita T. Yokota K. Imai Y. Kohsaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6879-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently R-Ras GAP, the entire structure of which is closely related to Gap1m, was isolated (17Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The identity of the amino acid sequences of R-Ras GAP and Gap1m is 60%. Despite the high sequence similarity to Gap1m, R-Ras GAP stimulates the GTPase of R-Ras better than that of Ras (17Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A previous study described that p120GAP stimulates the GTPase of R-Ras as efficiently as Ha-Ras (18Rey I. Taylor-Harris P. van Erp H. Hall A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that Gap1m stimulates the GTPase of the wild type of Ras but not that of the activated form of Ras, Rap1, or GTP-binding proteins of other families (19Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22948-22952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence we investigated in this study the enzymatic properties of Gap1m and compared them with those of p120GAP using Ras and R-Ras proteins as substrates. The results indicate that both Gap1m and p120GAP promote the GTPase of R-Ras and that Gap1mstimulates the GTPase of Ras better than that of R-Ras, in contrast to p120GAP the activity of which is higher with R-Ras as the substrate. The pGEX expression vectors for the Ras family proteins (17Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. K. Kaibuchi. The N-Ras expression system was a kind gift of Dr. A. Wittinghofer. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Ras fusion proteins were induced inEscherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described by Smith and Johnson (20Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were dialyzed overnight against 100 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mm MgCl2) and then concentrated to approximately 20 mg/ml using Centricon-10 (Amicon Inc.). Each fusion protein (500 μg) was digested with 1 μg of thrombin (Sigma) in buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2. The digested samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained by a SYPRO™ Orange stain kit (Bio-Rad), and the protein concentration was determined by quantitating the intensity of each band by Fluor Imager (Molecular Dynamics) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Concentrations of active proteins were determined by measuring their [3H]GDP binding activities (0.5–0.6 pmol of [3H]GDP bound per pmol of protein). These concentrations were employed in all experiments. To produce the GST-Gap1m fusion protein, theNcoI-EcoRI fragment of the cDNA of Gap1m (nucleotides 54 to 3′ end, accession number D30734) which covers the entire coding sequence was ligated to theBamHI site of pGEX2T by using synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-GTGGATC-3′ and 5′-GATCCAC-3′). TheSacII-EcoRI fragment of rat p120GAP cDNA (21Davis M.M. Catino J.J. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Perkins L.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 134: 305-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (a generous gift of Dr. Y. Kaziro, nucleotides 214 to 3′ end, accession number L13151) was cloned into the SmaI site of pGEX2T after blunting of the fragment which directed the expression of GST-p120GAP (amino acids 39 to carboxyl terminus) fusion protein. Each GST-fusion protein was cleaved by procedures similar to those described above and then applied to a column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated with buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol). The adsorbed materials were eluted by a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in buffer B. Fractions containing Gap1m (0.7–0.8 m NaCl) and p120GAP (0.3–0.4 m NaCl) were pooled and stored at −80 °C until use. The purity of Gap1m and p120GAP was more than 85% as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). GAP activity was measured as described previously (19Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22948-22952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the reaction was carried out at 30 °C. Typically, 2 pmol of each Ras·[γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol, ICN) was incubated at 30 °C with the indicated amounts of Gap1m or p120GAP for the times specified in the figure in 20 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm GTP, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. The reactions were quenched by keeping the sample on ice. After the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2), the sample was passed through a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). The filter was washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer, and the radioactivity trapped on the filter was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. For determination of the enzymatic properties (K m andk cat) of Gap1m and p120GAP, a constant amount of either Gap1m (1.2 nm for Ha-Ras and 1.5 nm for R-Ras) or p120GAP (20.0 nm for Ha-Ras and 3.0 nm for R-Ras) was incubated with various concentrations of Ha-Ras·[γ-32P]GTP or R-Ras·[γ-32P]GTP at 30 °C for 10 min. The amount of GTP hydrolyzed during the reaction was determined as a decrease in the radioactivity trapped on the filter. K m andk cat values were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation. The data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Ha-Ras·[γ-32P]GTP (2 nm) or R-Ras·[γ-32P]GTP (2 nm) was incubated with a constant amount of either Gap1m (0.3 nm for Ha-Ras and 1.2 nmfor R-Ras) or p120GAP (20 nm for Ha-Ras and 2 nm for R-Ras) in the presence of various concentrations of competitors, Ha-Ras·GTPγS, Ha-Ras·GDP, R-Ras·GTPγS, or R-Ras·GDP at 30 °C for 10 min. The GAP activity observed with a control sample without added competitor was taken as 100%, and the GAP activity of each sample was expressed as a percentage of the control sample. We identified and isolated Gap1m as the third GAP for Ras (16Maekawa M. Li S. Iwamatsu A. Morishita T. Yokota K. Imai Y. Kohsaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6879-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22948-22952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the entire structure of Gap1m is not similar to that of p120GAP or neurofibromin, we deduced that Gap1m may have distinct enzymatic properties. To investigate the substrate specificities of Gap1m and p120GAP, various concentrations of either Gap1m or p120GAP were incubated with each of the four Ras family proteins, and the enzyme concentration at which 50% of the maximal stimulation was achieved (EC50) was determined (Fig. 2). Gap1m showed a similar effect on the GTPase activities of three Ras proteins (EC50 values for N-Ras, Ha-Ras, and Ki-Ras were 0.56 ± 0.09, 0.48 ± 0.02, and 0.46 ± 0.04 nm, respectively). However, Gap1m was less effective in stimulation of the GTPase of R-Ras (EC50 1.13 ± 0.12 nm). In contrast, p120GAP exhibited higher activity in stimulation of the GTPase of R-Ras (EC50 3.86 ± 0.38 nm) than those of three Ras proteins (EC50values for Ki-Ras, N-Ras, and Ha-Ras were 12.5 ± 0.9, 23.1 ± 1.9, and 22.7 ± 1.5 nm, respectively). A similar tendency of substrate specificities of Gap1m and p120GAP was also observed when time course experiments were carried out using the four Ras family proteins as substrates (Fig.3). These data demonstrated that Gap1m stimulated GTPase activities of both Ras and R-Ras where Ras was activated higher than R-Ras. In contrast, p120GAP showed much higher activity toward R-Ras than Ras proteins under the same experimental conditions.Figure 3Time course of GTPase of Ras family proteins stimulated by Gap1m and p120GAP.[γ-32P]GTP-loaded Ras family proteins (100 nm each) were incubated at 30 °C for indicated periods of time with (filled symbols) or without (open symbols) 1 nm Gap1m (panel A) or 8 nm p120GAP (panel B). The data were shown as relative percentages as in Fig. 2. The substrates were with N-Ras (▵, ▴), Ha-Ras (□, ▪), Ki-Ras (▿, ▾), and R-Ras (○, •).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated whether there may be a relationship between the substrate preferences of Gap1m and p120GAP and their affinities to the substrates (Figs. 4 and 5). We measured the ability of Ha-Ras or R-Ras bound to either GTPγS (a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP) or GDP to inhibit competitively the GAP activity of Gap1m (Fig. 4). The inhibition constant (K i) is obtained as a concentration of the inhibitor at which 50% of GAP activity is inhibited (19Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22948-22952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ha-Ras·GTPγS was much more inhibitory on the activity of Gap1m (K i = 0.83 ± 0.12 μm) than Ha-Ras·GDP (K i = 3.27 ± 0.67 μm). R-Ras·GTPγS was also more effective in the inhibition of Gap1m activity (K i = 2.00 ± 0.21 μm) than R-Ras·GDP (K i = 4.31 ± 1.02 μm). In this analysis, the K i of R-Ras·GTPγS for Gap1m activity was 2.5 times higher than that of Ha-Ras·GTPγS. This higher affinity of Gap1m to Ha-Ras·GTPγS was in good agreement with the substrate preference of Gap1m; the EC50 of Gap1m for Ha-Ras was 2.5 times lower than that for R-Ras. The K i value of Ha-Ras·GDP was also lower than that of R-Ras·GDP.Figure 5Competitive inhibition of GAP activity on p120GAP by Ha-Ras or R-Ras. Panel A, p120GAP (20 nm) was incubated with Ha-Ras·[γ-32P]GTP (2 nm) and various concentrations of Ha-Ras·GTPγS (○) or Ha-Ras·GDP (□) for 10 min at 30 °C. Similarly, p120GAP (2 nm) was incubated with R-Ras·[γ-32P]GTP (2 nm) and various concentrations of R-Ras·GTPγS (•) or R-Ras·GDP (▪) (panel B). The data are shown as in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A similar experiment was carried out using p120GAP (Fig.5). The concentrations of the inhibitors were not enough for full inhibition of the activity. R-Ras·GTPγS was most effective in the inhibition of p120GAP activity; however, theK i of R-Ras·GTPγS was still over 10 μm. The effect of Ha-Ras·GTPγS was weaker than R-Ras·GTPγS, indicating that R-Ras·GTPγS bound to p120GAP more tightly than Ha-Ras·GTPγS did. Neither Ha-Ras·GDP nor R-Ras·GDP was inhibitory on p120GAP activity at the concentrations tested. Although we could not determine the K i of Ha-Ras·GTPγS, Vogel et al. (22Vogel U.S. Dixon R.A. Schaber M.D. Diehl R.E. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) reported that theK i of Ha-Ras·GTP is 110 μm. Thus, the relative affinities of p120GAP to R-Ras and Ha-Ras again correlated well with the substrate preference of p120GAP. These results suggested that the substrate specificities of both Gap1m and p120GAP may be determined by their affinities to the substrates. To investigate further the enzymatic properties of Gap1m and p120GAP, we determined the kinetics of the GTPase of Ha-Ras and R-Ras stimulated by GAPs. A fixed amount of Gap1m or p120GAP was incubated with various concentrations of either Ha-Ras·[γ-32P]GTP or R-Ras·[γ-32P]GTP, and the reaction rate of GTPase was determined (Fig. 6). Gap1mwas much more active than p120GAP in the stimulation of the GTPase activity of Ha-Ras. In contrast, activation of the R-Ras GTPase by Gap1m was similar to that by p120GAP at low concentrations of R-Ras, and p120GAP was more active at high concentrations of R-Ras. Since the activity of p120GAP was not saturable under the experimental conditions, the activity of p120GAP for Ha-Ras might also be higher than Gap1m at very high concentrations. The rate of GAP-stimulated GTPase was plotted as a function of substrate concentration according to the Michaelis-Menten equation which gave k cat(V max/E 0) andK m for the reactions (Fig.7). The K m values of Gap1m for Ha-Ras and R-Ras were 1.53 ± 0.27 and 3.38 ± 0.53 μm, respectively (Fig. 7 A). This result indicated that Gap1m had a higher binding affinity to Ha-Ras than R-Ras which agreed well with the results presented in Fig. 4. At saturating concentrations of the substrates, Gap1m showed somewhat higher activity for R-Ras than for Ha-Ras (k cat values for Ha-Ras and R-Ras were 3.96 ± 0.31 and 4.96 ± 0.74 s−1, respectively). p120GAP shows 7.5 times higher activity for R-Ras than Ha-Ras at any of the substrate concentrations examined (Fig. 6). By fitting the data to a double reciprocal plot, the K m and thek cat values of p120GAP for Ha-Ras were determined to be 145 ± 11 μm and 23.0 ± 3.4 s−1, respectively (Fig. 7 B). Accurate values of the K m and k cat of p120GAP for R-Ras could not be determined because the specific activity was completely proportional to the substrate concentration. These results are summarized in Table I.Table IEnzymatic properties of Gap1m and p120GAPGAPs and Substratesk catK mEC50K is−1μmnmμmGap1m Ha-Ras3.96 ± 0.311.53 ± 0.270.48 ± 0.020.83 ± 0.121-aDetermined by using Ha-Ras · GTPγS or R-Ras · GTPγS as a competitor.

Open table in a new tab In this study we examined the enzymatic properties and substrate specificity of Gap1m and compared them with those of p120GAP. Previously we demonstrated that Gap1m does not stimulate the GTPase of Rap1, Rho, and Ram25K (19Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22948-22952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study we used three Ras proteins and R-Ras as the substrates. Both Gap1m and p120GAP stimulated the GTPase of Ras and R-Ras. EC50 values of Gap1m for Ras proteins were two times lower than that for R-Ras (Fig. 1 and Table I), thus Gap1m stimulates Ras GTPase better than that of R-Ras (p < 0.01). In contrast, the EC50 of p120GAP for R-Ras was much lower than those for Ras proteins. Thus p120GAP activates the GTPase of R-Ras better than that of Ras. A previous report described that the catalytic domain of p120GAP (GAPette) stimulates the GTPase of both Ras and R-Ras with almost equal EC50 values (18Rey I. Taylor-Harris P. van Erp H. Hall A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was described that domains of p120GAP outside of the catalytic domain are necessary for the full activity (23Bryant S.S. Mitchell A.L. Collins F. Miao W. Marshall M. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5195-5199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Since the p120GAP used in this study lacks only 38 amino acid residues at the amino terminus, it seems to be an intrinsic property of p120GAP that it is more active for R-Ras than for Ras. We also measured the inhibition constant (K i) of Ras and R-Ras bound to GTPγS. The K i of Ras·GTPγS for Gap1m was 2.5 times lower than that of R-Ras·GTPγS, which agrees well with the ratio of K m values of Gap1m for Ras and R-Ras and also with the substrate specificity in that Gap1m stimulates GTPase of Ras better than that of R-Ras. Similarly, p120GAP promotes the GTPase of R-Ras better than that of Ras, and p120GAP binds more tightly to R-Ras than Ras. Hence, there may be a good correlation between the affinity of the GAPs to the substrates and their substrate preference. The K m values of p120GAP and neurofibromin for Ras have been reported to be 9.7 and 0.3 μm, respectively (24Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 25Wiesmuller L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10207-10210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions the K m of p120GAP for Ras was 145 μm. This difference in theK m values of these two p120GAP may be the result of different experimental conditions, i.e. temperatures, substrates, and the sources of p120GAP. The k catvalues of the two preparations are similar (19 s−1 (24Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and 23.4 s−1 (this study)). A similar highK m value of full-length p120GAP for Ras has also been reported (23Bryant S.S. Mitchell A.L. Collins F. Miao W. Marshall M. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5195-5199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The K m of Gap1m for Ras was 1.53 μm (Table I). Vogel et al. (22Vogel U.S. Dixon R.A. Schaber M.D. Diehl R.E. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) described that Ras in complex with nonradioactive GTP competes in the p120GAP-catalyzed reaction with the K i value of 110 μm. The K i value of Ras·GTPγS for recombinant Gap1m is 0.83 μm (Table I), which is similar to the value obtained using authentic Gap1m(19Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22948-22952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference between these K i values of the two GAPs agrees well with that between the K m values of p120GAP and Gap1m. Thus the affinity of p120GAP to the substrates is much weaker than that of Gap1m or neurofibromin by almost 2 orders of magnitude. Recently another Gap1m family termed R-Ras GAP, whose entire domain structure is very similar to Gap1m, was described (17Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The overall identity of the amino acid sequence is 60%. R-Ras GAP also stimulates the GTPase of Ras, but the stimulation is lower than that observed with R-Ras. In contrast, a GAP-related domain of neurofibromin stimulates GTPase of Ras stronger than R-Ras GTPase (17Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, all the known Ras GAPs and R-Ras GAP activate the GTPase of both Ras and R-Ras, with some different substrate preferences. GAP1IP4BP (26Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and GAPIII (27Baba H. Fuss B. Urano J. Poullet P. Watson J.B. Tamanoi F. Macklin W.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) seem to be human and mouse homologs of R-Ras GAP, respectively, since both of them show higher sequence similarity to R-Ras GAP than to Gap1m. Residues in the switch I region of Ras which are critical to the stimulation by p120GAP have been extensively characterized (12McCormick F. Cell. 1989; 56: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Within this region, the amino acid sequence of Ras from residue 32 to 40 is completely preserved in R-Ras and Rap1. However, although Rap1 binds to p120GAP, the GTPase of Rap1 is not stimulated by p120GAP (28Frech M. John J. Pizon V. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Clark R. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1990; 249: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Whereas both position 31 of Ras (glutamic acid) and the equivalent position of R-Ras (aspartic acid) are acidic residues, Rap1 has lysine at the corresponding position. Substitution of the 31st glutamic acid of Ras by lysine renders the mutated Ras a phenotype like Rap1 with concomitant loss of susceptibiltity to p120GAP (29Shirouzu M. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Ito Y. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that residue 31 of Ras or residues at the corresponding positions of R-Ras and Rap1 may be critical to their susceptibility to GAPs. What may be the biological implication deduced from the enzymatic properties of Ras GAPs? The weak binding affinity of p120GAP to the substrates suggests that factors that help the association of p120GAP with the substrate may increase the activity of p120GAP toward the substrates. Yao and Cooper (30Yao R. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1607-1614PubMed Google Scholar) reported that p120GAP with a membrane targeting signal showed higher specific activity in intact cells than p120GAP without the targeting signal. Since p120GAP binds to autophosphorylated receptors (31Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Wong G. McCormick F. Williams L.T. Cell. 1990; 61: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), such binding may help the local contact of p120GAP to its substrates located on the membranous structure. As pointed out by Bernards (32Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 43-59PubMed Google Scholar), this implies that p120GAP may act as a quencher of growth factor-activated signals rather than a regulator of basal activity of Ras and R-Ras. In contrast, the affinity of Gap1m or neurofibromin with their substrates is rather high such that they may be able to stimulate the GTPase of the substrates efficiently by themselves. Some portion of Gap1mand neurofibromin resides in the membranous fraction (19Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22948-22952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hattori S. Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 481-485PubMed Google Scholar). Such membrane localization of neurofibromin and Gap1m may facilitate the contact of these GAPs with their substrates. Thus Gap1m may regulate the basal activity of Ras and R-Ras as does neurofibromin (32Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 43-59PubMed Google Scholar)."

As “complex II,” it performs the two-electron oxidation of succinate to produce fumarate, while transferring the electrons to quinone (Q) to yield quinol (QH2). The reverse process is mediated by quinol:fumarate oxidoreductases (QFR), which occur in anaerobic and some facultative organisms. The two enzymes are related and are capable of catalyzing their respective reverse reactions under suitable conditions (1Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Müller F.

The largest subunit, a flavoprotein, contains the dicarboxylate binding site and one flavin moiety (FAD); the latter is covalently bound in most cases. The iron-sulfur protein is intermediate in size and contains three iron-sulfur clusters of type 2Fe-2S, 4Fe-4S, and 3Fe-4S, often referred to as S-1, S-2, and S-3, respectively, in the case of SQR. These two hydrophilic subunits protrude into the cytosol (prokaryotic enzyme) or the mitochondrial matrix (eukaryotic enzyme), and together catalyze the succinate dehydrogenase activity of the enzyme. They are anchored to the membrane by one or two hydrophobic quinone polypeptides (QP), which may contain zero, one, or twob-heme(s).

Trans. 1991; 19: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We chose to study the enzyme from P. denitrificans for the following reasons. The membrane-bound form of the P. denitrificans enzyme in whole cells is characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals like those observed in mammalian mitochondria (10Albracht S.P. Van Verseveld H.W. Hagen W.R. Kalkman M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). P. denitrificans appears to be the closest bacterial homologue to this organelle (11Yang D. Oyaizu Y. Oyaizu H. Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 4443-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 12John P. Whatley F.R. Nature. 1975; 254: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and its SQR is amenable to molecular genetic techniques. The purification and basic biochemical properties of SQR from this bacterium have also been reported (6Pennoyer J.D. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The air-oxidized, ferricyanide-oxidized, succinate- and dithionite-reduced forms of the enzyme have been investigated by EPR spectroscopy. Spectroscopic “signatures” accounting for each of the redox centers have been obtained at these different levels of reduction of the protein. EPR spectral simulations of the radical signals are consistent with two Q binding sites. An EPR signal characteristic of areduced 3Fe-4S cluster, has been observed for the first time for SQR or QFR. In addition, we have analyzed quantitatively the power saturation and redox behavior of the S-3 center in the air-oxidized enzyme, and the S-3 and S-1 centers in the succinate-reduced enzyme. Taken together, we conclude that S-3 center and the b-heme are coupled magnetically in their oxidized states, and presumably in their respective reduced and oxidized states, as well. Centricon ultrafiltration tubes were from Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA; dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was from Anatrace, Maumee, OH; 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxyl, and Sephadex G-50 were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.; polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether; Tris, Triton X-100, and polyoxethylene (9Salerno J.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) lauryl ether (Tesit) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN, or Mannheim, Germany); Amberlite XAD-2 adsorbent was from Serva, Heidelberg, Germany. All other reagents were of analytical reagent grade. Growth ofP. denitrificans (ATCC no. 13543) used for isolation of SQR was performed as described previously (13Stowell M.H.B. Larsen R.W. Winkler J.R. Rees D.C. Chan S.I. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 3054-3057Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested with a continuous flow centrifuge and frozen in liquid nitrogen as 200-g flat packs. Growth conditions for the PD1222/pPSD100 strain containing overproduced (∼2-fold) SQR, its construction, and isolation of membranes from it, will be described elsewhere. 2M. Matsson, L. Hederstedt, and B. A. C. Ackrell, manuscript in preparation. SQR was purified by thawing the stored cell packs using 150–200 g of material each time. The purification procedure was as described previously (6Pennoyer J.D. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with modifications similar to those described previously (14Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Steffens G.C.M. Pascual E. Buse G. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 521: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The enzyme was concentrated, and the salt and Triton X-100 concentrations of the final samples were reduced, the latter to ∼0.05% (w/v), by repeated exchange in Centricon 100-kDa cutoff concentrators against 100 mmHepes, pH 7.4. The final yield was 1–2 ml of 50–100 μmSQR. SQR from the PD1222/pPSD100 strain was purified in an identical fashion to that from the ATCC no. 13543 strain. The enzyme was considered sufficiently pure (>90%) for use in our experiments by criteria of optical spectra (negligible absorption due to hemes other than b 557) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6Pennoyer J.D. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined by measuring the acid-nonextractable FAD content of the samples (16Wilson D.F. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2683-2690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b concentrations were determined from dithionite reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectra in a pyridine hemochrome assay mixture, using Δε557–540 = 24.0 mm−1 cm−1 (17Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The SQR activity was measured with a large excess of ubiquinone-2 (Q2; 20 μm) and dichlorophenol-indophenol as the primary and terminal electron acceptors, respectively (6Pennoyer J.D. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Trumpower B.L. Simmons Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4608-4616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); activation of the enzyme was achieved by incubating the enzyme (in Triton X-100) for 20 min at 298 K in 50 mm Tris buffer, 50 mm sodium succinate, 0.2 mm dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, pH 7.5. Typical turnover numbers (moles of succinate/mol of SQR) of the purified enzyme at 310 K were 300–350 s−1 based on the FAD concentrations of the samples (see also Ref. 6Pennoyer J.D. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Extraction of the protein-bound ubiquinone-10 (Q10) was performed according to the procedure of Redfearn (19Redfearn E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 381-384Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Its concentration was determined using ubiquinone-6 (Q6) as an internal standard for analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (275 nm) employing a C18 reverse-phase column and eluting with a solvent gradient starting at 25:75% water:acetonitrile and finishing at 100% acetonitrile. Samples stored at 193 K were thawed on ice and equilibrated with argon prior to freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen to remove oxygen from the system. Samples reduced with excess sodium succinate (35–100 mm, pH 7.4) were incubated for 45 min at 297–300 K; (sodium) dithionite-reduced samples (10 mm, pH 7.4) were incubated for 5 min at the same temperature. The succinate concentrations were varied between 35 and 100 mm to yield [succinate]/[SQR] ≈ 1300 (E ≈ −71 mV, where E denotes solution potential; see below), for samples with different SQR concentrations; dithionite-reduced samples may be approximated by E ≤ −400 mV. Succinate- and dithionite-reduced PD1222/pPSD100 membranes in 20 mm MOPS, 65 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, were treated identically, except for the addition of 2 mm KCN (final concentration) to these samples. Ferricyanide-oxidized SQR was obtained by incubating the sample with excess ferricyanide, which was subsequently removed by Sephadex G-50 column filtration. Samples, to which a 3-fold excess of (exogenous) Q2 were added, were incubated for 5 min at 295 K and subsequently reduced with excess succinate, as described above. The QP were isolated from detergent-depleted SQR using perchlorate, essentially as described for the mammalian enzyme (20Hatefi Y. Galante Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5530-5537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nonionic detergent Thesit (1.5% w/v) was removed from the SQR-detergent micelle mixture by adsorption to Amberlite XAD-2 beads. EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E-109 X-band spectrometer equipped with a E-231 TE-102 rectangular cavity, and interfaced with an IBM personal computer for accumulation and digitization of the spectra. Sample temperature was controlled by a variable temperature helium flow cryostat system (Oxford Instruments). Spectral manipulation was performed using the program Labcalc on an IBM personal computer. Quantitation of the reduced S-1 and S-3 signal intensities (see Fig. 5) was performed by measuring peak heights (21Orme-Johnson, N. R., and Orme-Johnson, W. H. (1978)Methods Enzymol. 252–257.Google Scholar); double integration of the digitized first-derivative spectra was performed in the case of the oxidized S-3 center (see Fig. 4). Spectra obtained at liquid helium temperatures (4–20 K) were base-line-corrected by subtracting spectra derived from a buffer-filled EPR tube under identical conditions. EPR signal line widths are given as peak-to-trough line widths under nonsaturating conditions. The combined spin concentrations of the radical signals due to FAD⋅and Q⋅] 3We shall not distinguish here between the protonated and anionic forms of the FAD and Q semiquinones. In the bovine heart enzyme FAD⋅ and Q⋅ are predominantly in the protonated (49Ohnishi T. King T.E. Salerno J.C. Blum H. Bowyer J.R. Maida T. J. Biol.

Neese, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany) on an IBM-compatible 486:50 MHz computer. The computer program uses first-order perturbation theory to simulate the EPR transitions as a function of the magnetic field (or frequency). This treatment was deemed to be sufficient, as the conditionA 0 ≪ g e β e B is fulfilled for radicals; i.e. their hyperfine interactions are much smaller than their Zeeman interactions. Initial estimates of the anisotropy (axiality) in the g and hyperfine (A) matrices corresponding to the strongly coupled nitrogens of the FAD⋅, as well as the line widths (x, y, and z) of the FAD⋅, were obtained from those reported previously for flavoproteins. Proton hyperfine interactions and “g strain” were neglected (22Eriksson L.E.G. Ehrenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 293: 57-66Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Initial simulations were generated using the option “Spectra series,” which allows the simulator to test the effect of a particular EPR parameter on the (simulated) spectrum. When a satisfactory likening between the simulated and experimental spectrum was obtained, the g values and spectral weights of the Q⋅ were “fine-tuned” using the option “Fit” (Simplex algorithm; see “Results” and the legend of Fig. 3 for further details). Redox calculations used to estimate the percentage reduction of the redox centers within SQR in the presence of excess succinate (E ≈ −71 mV) and dithionite (E < −400 mV) were programmed in Mathematica (version 2.2.2) (23Wolfram S. Mathematica. Addison-Wesley, Redwood City, CA1994Google Scholar); the program is available from Dr. Chan upon request. The values of the redox midpoint potentials (E m values) used in the calculations were those measured for the bovine heart enzyme, 5Preliminary redox titrations (S.-C. Hung, A. R. Waldeck, and S. I. Chan, unpublished results) have shown that E m ≈ 60 mV for the P. denitrificans S-3 center, as in the bovine heart enzyme (26Ohnishi T. Lim J. Winter D.B. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2105-2109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A spin concentration of 90% is predicted for the S-1 center using the bovine-heart E m value (−14 mV) (24Bonomi F. Pagani S. Cerleti P. Giori C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); this compares well with the 88% measured experimentally (see “Results”). The resonances due to the S-2 center are elicited by dithionite reduction, but not by succinate reduction, as in the bovine heart protein (E m = −260 mV) (25Maguire J.J. Johnson M.K. Morningstar J.E. Ackrell B.A.C. Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10909-10912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). unless mentioned otherwise 6The spin concentration of the composite FAD⋅-2Q⋅ signal (Fig. 3) in succinate-reduced samples (E ≈ −71 mV) has been measured (see “EPR Methods”) to amount to ∼44% of the FAD (protein) concentrations for enzyme isolated from both strains. Using this estimate and the spectral weight of (Q A ⋅ + Q B ⋅) with respect to FAD⋅ (see legend of Fig. 3) we estimate 33% FAD⋅:FAD and 11% Q⋅:FAD (16% Q⋅:Q), and 36% FAD⋅:FAD and 8% Q⋅:FAD (≥4% Q⋅:Q) for samples isolated from the ATCC no. 13543 and PD1222/pPSD100 strain supplemented with a 3-fold excess of Q2, respectively (see also legend of Fig. 3). Note that in the latter preparation maximally 2Q may bind. These spin concentrations are reproduced in the redox calculations using: EmFAD/FAD⋅ = EmFAD·/FADH2 = −71 mV; and EmQ/Q⋅ = 30 mV; EmQ·QH2 = −20 mV, EmFe3+/Fe2+= −175 mV, at pH 7.4 for the P. denitrificans enzyme(measured using redox mediators) (M.

https://openalex.org/W2103420139,"In this report, we present new structural data on the size, shape, and oligomeric form of higher plant photosystem I (PSI) formed within the thylakoid grana margins. We show that PSI complexes can be assembled into ordered molecular monolayers (two-dimensional crystals) using thylakoid membranes from a variety of higher plant sources. Digital image analysis of negatively stained two-dimensional crystals (a = 26.9 nm,b = 28.0 nm, γ = 90°,p22121 plane group) resulted in a projection map consisting of 4 monomers/unit cell. Higher plant PSI is slightly larger than its cyanobacterial equivalent but shows many similar features. Structural changes after urea and salt washing of the crystals supported the biochemical characterization and were mainly assigned to the stromal side of the complex where the psaC,psaD, and psaE gene products are known to be bound. Labeling with ferredoxin-colloidal gold complexes provided direct evidence for a segregated PSI population, with 5 nm diameter ferredoxin-gold particles enriched in the thylakoid grana margins and the two-dimensional crystals. This lateral segregation of photosynthetic complexes is important for the understanding of the kinetics of electron transfer between photosystem II and PSI in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W2077414678,"We have shown that attachment to a fibronectin substrate stimulates two pathways of lipid biosynthesis in cultured human fibroblasts. Detachment of these cells (mechanically, with trypsin, or by RGDS peptides) caused a significant decrease in their 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity and in their incorporation of [3H]acetate into fatty acids. This inhibition was substantially reversed by the reattachment of cells to fibronectin substrates, but not to poly-l-lysine substrates or to fibronectin in solution. Inhibiting phosphoprotein phosphatase activity with okadaic acid blocked the recovery of both biosynthetic activities.Both 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and fatty acid biosynthesis are known to be inhibited by the action of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase, which is activated by an increase in the level of AMP relative to ATP. For example, in our system, sodium azide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose increased the ratio of cellular AMP to ATP and caused a decrease in lipid biosynthesis. We then verified the prediction that detachment of cells from substrates also caused an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. We therefore conclude that the attachment of cells to fibronectin promotes lipid biosynthesis, presumably in coordination with the cellular growth response evoked by attachment to the extracellular matrix.

The interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix leads to complex adaptive responses in the cytoplasm (1Hynes R.O.

In particular, the binding of fibronectins to plasma membrane integrins results in their clustering, promoting the colocalization of cytoskeletal proteins and the formation of focal adhesions.

Acta. 1992; 1123: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The regulatory pathways are not fully understood. The impact of cell adhesion on the biosynthesis of the major membrane bilayer lipids has not been evaluated heretofore. Here we test the hypothesis that membrane lipid biosynthesis responds to the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix. [3H]Acetic acid (sodium salt, 100 mCi/mmol), [14C]acetic acid (sodium salt, 59 mCi/mmol), and dl-3-hydroxy-3-methyl[3-14C]glutaryl coenzyme A (57.7 mCi/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. [5-3H]Mevalonolactone (60 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. [4-14C]Cholesterol (53 mCi/mmol) and [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (58 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham Corp. Tributylamine was from Fisher. Bovine plasma fibronectin and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Lipoprotein-deficient serum was prepared from fetal bovine serum as described (14Lange Y. Matthies H.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14624-14630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]Triglyceride and [14C]cholesteryl esters, used as recovery standards, were purified by TLC from hepatoma cells that had been incubated for 4 h with [14C]acetate. Human foreskin fibroblasts were derived from primary explants and used between passages 4 and 15 (14Lange Y. Matthies H.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14624-14630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some experiments were repeated with the FU5AH rat hepatoma cell line (15Rothblat G.H. Arbogast L. Kritchevsky D. Naftulin M. Lipids. 1976; 11: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. In studies using fibroblasts, cultures were preincubated overnight in medium containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum. Dissociation was by incubation with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin plus 0.5 mm EDTA for 2 min at 37 °C. Then 2.5 mg/ml egg white trypsin inhibitor was added, and the cells were chilled on ice for 5 min and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were suspended in buffer A (135 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaHEPES (pH 7.4), 3 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml glucose). The suspended cells were either assayed immediately or, following a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, replated in buffer A in Petri dishes. The dishes had been precoated with 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine or 5 μg/ml fibronectin overnight and then blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to use. Reattachment was assessed by cholesterol mass measurement after 30 min. We found that 80–90% of the cells attached to poly-l-lysine and 70–80% of the cells attached to fibronectin. Cells were extracted in 50 mmK2HPO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA containing 1% Kyro EOB (Procter and Gamble Co.) and 50 mm NaF (16Brown M.S. Dana S.E. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2162-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To extract attached cells, this buffer was added directly to the flask, and the cell residue was scraped into tubes on ice. To extract suspended cells, trypsin inhibitor was added, cells were pelleted and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the final pellet was resuspended in the extraction buffer. The assay used [14C]hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A as a substrate, with [3H]mevalonolactone as a recovery standard (16Brown M.S. Dana S.E. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2162-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cells on plates or in suspension were incubated at 37 °C with 20 μCi/ml [3H]acetate for 45 min (for fatty acids) or 60 min (for sterols). Plated cells were released with trypsin; cells attached to poly-l-lysine or fibronectin were gently scraped from the dish. The cells were washed, resuspended, and extracted with 5 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). [14C]Triglycerides, [14C]cholesteryl esters, and/or [14C]sphingomyelin were added as recovery standards. To resolve cholesterol esters and triglycerides, we used solvent A: petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (90:10:1, v/v). To isolate free fatty acids, we used petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1). To isolate sterols, we used isopropyl ether/acetic acid (96:4) for 1.5 h, followed by solvent A for an additional 40 min. Chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:2, v/v) was used to resolve sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. Lipids were visualized with I2, and the spots corresponding to authentic standards were scraped into vials for the determination of radioactivity. The only major sterols to be labeled were lanosterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, zymosterol, lathosterol, and cholesterol, as determined by HPLC. These were analyzed together as a single complex spot resolved by TLC. Cholesterol esters were recovered from TLC with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and saponified prior to determination of radioactivity. Tritium in free fatty acids, triglycerides, the saponifiable fraction of cholesteryl esters, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and sphingomyelin were measured individually and summed. Attached or suspended cells were incubated with 4 μCi/ml [3H]acetate for 1 h at 37 °C. The labeled cells were dissociated from the substratum and resuspended in 1 volume of 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11). The suspended cells were pelleted and resuspended in the same buffer. Five volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were added to the suspensions together with a [14C]cholesterol recovery standard. The lipid phase was separated and re-extracted using a dummy aqueous phase. The strongly alkaline buffer kept the free [3H]acetate in the aqueous phase, i.e. <0.01% of the [3H]acetate partitioned into the organic phase. Cholesterol mass and the radioactivity incorporated into total lipids were then measured. The cholesterol pathway contributed ∼10% of the total radioactivity incorporated into lipids, the remainder being mostly fatty acids. This assay gave results comparable to those obtained as described above for the incorporation of tritium into sterols and fatty acids. Cells were extracted at room temperature in 50% ethanol containing 50 mm acetic acid plus 0.01 mm EDTA. For plated cells, the solvent was added directly to the flasks, which were shaken at 300 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then scraped into tubes. Suspended cells were pelleted, washed, resuspended in the solvent, and incubated for 5 min with vortexing. The extracts were centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was retained. Pellets were re-extracted, and the extracts were pooled and dried under N2. AMP, ADP, and ATP were quantified by HPLC using a reversed-phase C18 column run at 18 °C with 5% acetonitrile, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and 2 mm tributylamine as the mobile phase (17Schobert B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cholesterol mass was determined by HPLC (18Echevarria F. Norton R.A. Nes W.D. Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8484-8489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the Pierce BCA assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (19Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Dissociation of confluent monolayers of fibroblasts led to a 42% decrease in the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in sterol biosynthesis (TableI, Experiment 1). Similar results were obtained by releasing cells from the flask with trypsin plus EDTA or by mechanical scraping. The decrease in enzyme activity occurred immediately upon detachment and persisted for at least 2 h of incubation. Comparable results were obtained with rat hepatoma cells.Table IEffect of cell attachment on HMG-CoA reductase activityCellsHMG-CoA reductase activityRelative activityMean ± S.D.

Fresh buffer with or without 0.75 mg/ml RGDS peptide was added, and the dishes were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were removed and pelleted by centrifugation.

The second and third columns show the results of a representative experiment; the fourth column gives the mean results of three experiments. Dissociated cells were replated on tissue culture plastic coated with either poly-l-lysine (for nonspecific attachment) or fibronectin (for specific attachment) (20Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Attachment to poly-l-lysine had little effect on enzyme activity. On the other hand, reattachment to fibronectin led to full recovery of HMG-CoA reductase activity within 1 h (Table I, Experiment 1). Plating cells on untreated tissue culture plastic in the presence of 10% serum or 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum led to recovery of HMG-CoA reductase activity similar to that observed when cells were replated on fibronectin (data not shown); this effect was most likely mediated by the fibronectin or other matrix components present in the serum. We also measured cholesterol biosynthesis in intact cells from the incorporation of [3H]acetate into sterols (Fig.1). Biosynthetic activity decreased in suspended cells compared with growing cells and recovered upon reattachment to fibronectin, but not to poly-l-lysine. The HMG-CoA reductase activity in detached cells was about half of the control (Table I), whereas incorporation of [3H]acetate into sterols dropped to about one-third (Fig. 1). This difference might reflect the fact that the activity of squalene epoxidase also appeared to be inhibited upon cell suspension. 2K. Page and Y. Lange, unpublished observations. The incorporation of [3H]acetate into fatty acids in dissociated cells was ∼15% of that in attached cells. Reattachment of the cells to fibronectin led to substantial recovery, whereas reattachment to poly-l-lysine had no effect (Fig. 1). To test whether fibroblast attachment to fibronectin was mediated by integrins, we used the RGDS peptide as a soluble competitor for integrin binding sites (20Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Incubation with 0.75 mg/ml RGDS peptide for 45 min led to the release of >85% of the cells plated on fibronectin. There was no detectable release following addition of the RGDS peptide to cells plated on poly-l-lysine. Detaching cells from fibronectin by the RGDS peptide reduced their HMG-CoA reductase activity to half that of attached cells (Table I, Experiment 2). Addition of serum fibronectin (10 μg/ml) to cells in suspension did not affect HMG-CoA reductase activity (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the premise that recovery of enzyme activity was the consequence of attachment to immobilized fibronectin (21Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether new protein synthesis was required for the increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity upon binding to fibronectin. The presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide inhibited protein synthesis by 90%. However, this pretreatment had no effect on enzyme activity in replated cells (data not shown). Both acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and HMG-CoA reductase are inhibited by phosphorylation mediated by 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (reviewed in Refs. 13Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Hardie D.G. MacKintosh R.W. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, and 23Hardie D.G. Carling D. Sim A.T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This kinase is activated by a high ratio of 5′-AMP to ATP (24Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 25Henin N. Vincent M.-F. Gruber H.E. Van den Berghe G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We therefore measured AMP, ADP, and ATP levels in plated and suspended cells. The ratio of AMP to ATP increased 2.5-fold upon cell suspension both in fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A) and in hepatoma cells (data not shown). This moderate increase in the AMP/ATP ratio is associated with a ∼7-fold decrease in the incorporation of [3H]acetate into fatty acids (Fig. 1). A nonlinear relationship between these variables was also reported in studies of freshly isolated hepatocytes (24Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 26Moore F. Weeks J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Several factors could account for this acute response. (a) Some ATP and/or ADP could be broken down to AMP during cell extraction so that the AMP/ATP ratio was actually lower in vivo. On the other hand, no such hydrolysis was found when exogenous nucleotide standards were included in the extraction. (b) The pathway leading from the nucleotide ratio to the activity of the biosynthetic enzymes is complex (26Moore F. Weeks J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For example, a small activation of the kinase could lead to a large amount of phosphorylation, hence inhibition, of the biosynthetic enzymes. (c) Furthermore, 5′-AMP activates the kinase both directly (27Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and through stimulation of an upstream kinase kinase (26Moore F. Weeks J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This compound action could lead to a variable nonlinear response to the AMP/ATP ratio. We further tested the validity of the hypothesis that the observed changes in the AMP/ATP ratio could regulate the lipid biosynthetic enzymes by manipulating this parameter in other ways. As expected (28Witters L.A. Nordlund A.-C. Marshall L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1486-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we found that the addition of the energy poison sodium azide to plated cells evoked a 1.8-fold increase in the AMP/ATP (Fig. 2 B) and a 2-fold decrease in the incorporation of [3H]acetate into lipids (Fig. 2 C). Similarly, incubation with 50 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose increased the AMP/ATP ratio in the cells 2.6-fold (see also Ref. 29Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9261-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and decreased lipid biosynthesis ∼3-fold (data not shown). The fact that these in vitro manipulations of the AMP/ATP ratio elicited a smaller response in lipid biosynthesis than did detachment raises the possibility that other, parallel pathways could be involved in the physiologic response. The inactivation of HMG-CoA reductase by phosphorylation is reversed by a specific phosphatase (30Gibson D.M. Parker R.A. Stewart C.E. Evenson K.J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1982; 20: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which can be inhibited by okadaic acid (26Moore F. Weeks J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We therefore plated cells onto poly-l-lysine or fibronectin in the absence or presence of okadaic acid and quantified total lipid biosynthesis using the rapid assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” We observed that okadaic acid blocked the recovery of enzyme activity upon attachment to fibronectin, but had no effect on cells attached to the nonspecific poly-l-lysine substratum (Table II). This result not only supports the hypothesis that phosphorylation mediates the inhibition of the enzymes under study, but suggests that the increase in lipid biosynthesis upon cell attachment to fibronectin involves the action of a phosphatase.Table IIEffect of okadaic acid on the activities of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and HMG-CoA reductaseSubstrateAddition3H incorporationRelativeMean ± S.D.

That the dissociation of cells from a fibronectin substratum leads to a reversible increase in the ratio of AMP to ATP in the cytoplasm is a novel finding. This small shift in “energy-charge ratio” (22Hardie D.G. MacKintosh R.W. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) could then activate cytoplasmic 5′-AMP-dependent kinase (13Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), leading to the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and HMG-CoA reductase (13Hardie D.G.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This action of the 5′-AMP kinase could serve multiple homeostatic purposes, as follows. (a) Activation of 5′-AMP-dependent kinase by a decreased energy charge would conserve energy reserves under conditions of cellular stress (24Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), simulated here by detachment from the substratum. Similar responses may be why insulin (32Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2864-2867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and heat shock (24Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) also raise the AMP/ATP ratio and activate the 5′-AMP-dependent kinase. (b) Cell growth is coordinated with membrane synthesis (33Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It is therefore appropriate that detachment from the extracellular matrix sends a signal to decrease membrane lipid biosynthesis (12Siperstein M.D. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rao K.N. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar). (c) A reduction in the synthesis of mevalonic acid by HMG-CoA reductase could lead to the inhibition of dolichol synthesis, affecting the provision of dolichol sugars for the biosynthesis of membrane and matrix glycoproteins and glycolipids (12Siperstein M.D. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rao K.N. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar). (d) Decreased isoprenoid biosynthesis could similarly lower the prenylation of G proteins, compromising their ability to up-regulate cell growth and drive the cell cycle (34Rao K.N. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane phosphoinositide metabolism is also sensitive to the binding of cells to the extracellular matrix (35McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, this response presumably reflects the role of these lipids in intracellular signaling, rather than in membrane biogenesis for cell growth. Finally, the mechanistic link between fibronectin binding and the regulation of the AMP/ATP ratio remains to be determined. Fibronectins not only interact with integrins through RGD sites (21Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but they also bind to heparan moieties on syndecans, signal-transducing integral plasma membrane proteoglycans (36Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, since the effects on lipid biosynthesis were reversed by RGDS peptides, it is parsimonious to postulate the involvement of integrins rather than syndecans. Conceivably, fibronectin binding affects the activity of adenylate kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the equilibration of AMP, ADP, and ATP. Modulation of adenylate kinase activity may serve as an intracellular signaling mechanism (37Olson L.K. Schroeder W. Robertson R.P. Goldberg N.D. Walseth T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16544-16552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and its role in the coordination between cell-surface adhesion and lipid biosynthetic activity is worth exploring.

Miech R.P. Parks Jr., R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Like other nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases, GK plays an important role in the synthesis of the nucleotide precursors for nucleic acids. Interestingly, several recently discovered membrane proteins contain domains that share significant homology with the entire sequence of GK (2Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that GK may be involved in guanine nucleotide-mediated signal transduction pathways by regulating the ratio of GTP and GDP (3Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Human GK plays an important role in activation of the anti-herpes drugs acyclovir and gancyclovir (4Miller W.H. Miller R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7204-7207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Boehme R.E. J. Biol.

Thus it is of biomedical significance to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and the structural basis of nucleotide specificity. Human GK has been recently cloned (8Fitzgibbon J. Katsanis N. Wells D. Delhanty J. Vallins W. Hunt D.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,9Brady W.A. Kokoris M.S. Fitzgibbon M. Black M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16734-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the human enzyme is inactive when it is expressed inEscherichia coli or produced by cell-free translations (9Brady W.A. Kokoris M.S. Fitzgibbon M. Black M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16734-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have been interested in studying the structure-function relationships of yeast GK because its structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Yeast GK shares ∼50% amino acid identities with the human enzyme. The amino acid residues that interact with the bound GMP (Fig. 1) are strictly conserved not only between the two enzymes but also among all known GKs.Recently we have reported the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the wild-type GK and the roles of Tyr-50 in structure and catalysis (10Li Y. Zhang Y. Yan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28038-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Y. Li Y. Yan H. Structural and Functional Roles of Tyrosine 50 of Yeast Guanylate Kinase: Techniques in Protein Chemistry.in: Marshak D.R. Academic Press, San Diego1997Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In this report we describe characterization of the roles of Tyr-78 by site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with kinetics, two-dimensional NMR, and chemical-induced denaturation. We show that Tyr-78 plays an important role in binding of GMP and catalysis. It also contributes to the conformational stability of GK but it is not important for appropriate folding. In addition, we have examined the conformational and dynamic changes of the WT GK induced by binding of GMP.DISCUSSIONGK belongs to the family of NMP kinases. Among NMP kinases, adenylate kinase has been most extensively studied (25Tsai M.D. Yan H.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6806-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). High resolution crystal structures have been reported for adenylate kinase, GK, and UMP/CMP kinase (24Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Dreusicke D. Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30Müller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1995; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 31Müller-Dieckmann H.J. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Scheffzek K. Kliche W. Wiesmuller L. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9716-9727Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding sites of all known structures are highly conserved. The AMP-binding site of adenylate kinase and the UMP/CMP-binding site of UMP/CMP kinase are also very similar. On the other hand, the chain fold of the GMP-binding domain of GK is grossly different from those of the NMP-binding domains of adenylate kinase and UMP/CMP kinase (24Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The AMP-binding domain and the UMP/CMP-binding domain are completely α-helical. In contrast, the GMP-binding domain is composed of a four-stranded β-sheet and only a short helix (Fig. 1). While only two arginine residues are involved in binding the phosphate moiety of the NMP in adenylate kinase or UMP/CMP kinase, the phosphate moiety of the bound GMP in GK interacts with a pair of tyrosine residues as well as a pair of arginine residues. In this study, we have focused on the structural and functional roles of Tyr-78. Substitution of Tyr-78 with a phenylalanine caused a decrease in k cat by a factor of 131 and increases inK m and K i for GMP by a factor of ∼20, and little changes in K m andK i for MgATP. The mutation also resulted in a decrease in the stability of the enzyme by ∼1.0 kcal/mol. Since the changes in the kinetic properties and conformational stability could be due to global structural perturbations, we have compared the conformation of the mutant with that of the WT GK by NMR. Detailed analysis of the two-dimensional spectra of the aromatic protons has indicated that there are only a few small changes (<0.05 ppm) in the chemical shifts in the mutant spectra at the free state, and all the interresidue NOEs except a weak one are retained. The results suggest that Y78F is appropriately folded and its conformation is highly similar to that of the WT GK. The decrease in conformational stability is not likely the result of global structural changes. Comparison of the two-dimensional spectra of the GMP-bound forms has indicated that there are some large changes in the chemical shifts (Tyr-50 and Fa, >0.1 ppm). Since both Tyr-78 and Tyr-50 are hydrogen-bonded to the phosphate of GMP (24Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the chemical shift changes of Tyr-50 are likely due to changes in the local electronic environment. Substitution of Tyr-50 with a phenylalanine also causes large changes in the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons of Tyr-78 at the GMP-bound state (11Zhang Y. Li Y. Yan H. Structural and Functional Roles of Tyrosine 50 of Yeast Guanylate Kinase: Techniques in Protein Chemistry.in: Marshak D.R. Academic Press, San Diego1997Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, replacement of Tyr-50 or Tyr-78 with a phenylalanine does not alter the chemical shifts of the other residue in the free form, indicating the two tyrosine residues do not interact at the unliganded state. The causes for the chemical shift changes of other residues are not obvious. Some minor changes in the chemical shifts are likely due to small differences in the experimental conditions such as pH and degree of GMP saturation. Most interresidue NOEs observed in the NOESY spectrum of the WT complex are also observed in the NOESY spectrum of the mutant complex. Furthermore, the substituted phenylalanine appears to assume the position of Tyr-78 because Phe-78 in the mutant complex has NOEs with both Tyr-50 and the bound GMP as Tyr-78 in the WT complex. Taken together, the results suggest that the conformation of the mutant complex is very similar to that of the WT complex. Therefore we conclude that the changes in the kinetic parameters are not due to global conformational changes. This is corroborated by the lack of significant changes in K m and K i for MgATP. The changes in the kinetic properties are also unlikely to be caused by the decrease in conformational stability because the mutant is still stable for days at room temperature. The above information allows us to attribute the changes in the properties of the mutant to the removal of the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Tyr-78 and the phosphate of GMP. On the basis of the kinetic data we estimate that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-78 and GMP stabilizes the binary GMP complex by 1.7 kcal/mol, the ternary complex by 1.8 kcal/mol, and the transition state by 4.6 kcal/mol.We have reported the characterization of the structural and functional roles of Tyr-50 (11Zhang Y. Li Y. Yan H. Structural and Functional Roles of Tyrosine 50 of Yeast Guanylate Kinase: Techniques in Protein Chemistry.in: Marshak D.R. Academic Press, San Diego1997Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group of Tyr-50 is also hydrogen-bonded to the phosphate of GMP with similar geometry. In comparison with Try-50, Tyr-78 contributes less to the stabilization of the binary and ternary complexes by ∼0.5 kcal/mol. This is consistent with the crystallographic observation that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-78 and the phosphate of GMP is slightly longer and therefore a bit weaker than that between Tyr-50 and the phosphate of GMP. However, compared with Tyr-50, Tyr-78 contributes more to the transition state stabilization by 1.4 kcal/mol and therefore is more important for catalysis. This suggests that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-78 and GMP becomes stronger than that between Tyr-50 and GMP as the reaction progresses to the transition state.Substrate-induced fit is believed to be the mechanism by which kinases use to avoid hydrolytic activity (33Koshland Jr., D.E. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 2375-2378Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the active centers of NMP kinases are assembled with large domain movements upon binding of both substrates (31Müller-Dieckmann H.J. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GK is also expected to undergo substrate-induced movements (24Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because of its small size and stability, GK is an excellent model system for detailed analysis of the mechanisms of substrate-induced fit by NMR. Binding of GMP causes significant changes (>0.05 ppm) in the chemical shifts of a number of aromatic spin systems (Tyr-50, Trp-70, Tyr-78, Ya, Fa, Fc, and Fi/Fj) (Figs. 2 A and 3 A). Fe changes so dramatically that it cannot be identified in the spectra of the complexed form. The changes in the chemical shifts of Tyr-50 and Tyr-78 are likely caused by hydrogen bonding to the phosphate of the bound GMP and the ring current effects of GMP. The chemical shift changes of other residues may reflect conformational changes induced by binding of GMP, although small chemical shift changes may be due to slight variations in the experimental conditions. These chemical shift changes are unlikely due to ring current effects because all aromatic residues except Tyr-50 and Tyr-78 are ≥9 Å away from the guanine moiety of GMP. The interpretation is supported by the NOESY data and the paramagnetic probe TEMPOL. Comparison of the NOESY spectra of the free and GMP-bound forms (Figs. 5 A and 6 A) shows that most NOEs are identical between the two forms of GK. However, there are three pairs of residues (Yb and Fi/Fj; Tyr-78 and Fi/Fj; Fc and Fd) with NOEs in the free form but not in the GMP-bound form and another three pairs of residues (Ya and Fb; Tyr-50 and Fi/Fj; Fc and Fi/Fj) that show NOEs in the GMP-bound form but not in the free form. In contrast, comparison of the NOESY spectra of the WT GK and Y78F reveals that only a few NOEs (one in the free form and four in the GMP-bound form) become very weak or disappear in the mutant spectra. No additional NOE peaks appear in the mutant spectra. The results suggest that there are conformational changes upon binding of GMP. However, the conformations of the free form and the GMP-bound form are very similar. This is characteristic of the domain movements resulting from hinge and shear motions (34Gerstein M. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6739-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).Figure 6NOSEY spectra of aromatic protons of WT GK (A) and Y78F (B) both in complex with GMP.Interresidue NOEs and the NOEs between the bound GMP and the aromatic residues are numerically labeled.

Addition of the paramagnetic probe TEMPOL resulted in significant attenuation of many cross-peaks (Figs.3 B and 4 B). However, it did not cause any significant changes in their chemical shifts, indicating that TEMPOL does not bind to GK. Furthermore, qualitatively, TEMPOL accessibility determined for the GMP complex is consistent with the solvent accessibility calculated from the crystal structure coordinate (24Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus the attenuation of the cross-peaks is likely due to the exposure of the side chains to TEMPOL but not specific binding. Binding of GMP brings protection of several aromatic residues from the paramagnetic bleaching, including Tyr-50 and Tyr-78. However, Fc becomes more accessible to TEMPOL in the presence of GMP. As mentioned earlier, only Tyr-50 and Tyr-78 are in close vicinity of the bound GMP. Thus the changes in the TEMPOL accessibility upon binding of GMP are likely due to substrate-induced changes in conformation and/or dynamics. Müller et al. (30Müller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1995; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (344) Google Scholar) have recently determined the crystal structure of free E. coli adenylate kinase. Comparing it with the crystal structure of the same enzyme in complex with Ap5A, a bisubstrate analogue, they have noticed significant differences in the distribution of B-factors between the two structures. On the basis of B-factors, they have suggested that the lid and AMP-binding domains are mobile in the free form and become immobilized upon binding of Ap5A. On the other hand, two loops (α4-β3 and α5-β4) are fixed in the free form and become mobile upon binding of Ap5A. They have proposed that the two mobile loops are the “energetic counterweight” that prevent the enzyme from being trapped in an energetic well. It is of great interest to see how substrate-induced conformational and dynamic changes in GK correlate with catalysis.In conclusion, we have shown that the hydrogen bond between hydroxyl group of Tyr-78 and the phosphate of GMP is critical for binding of GMP and catalysis. It stabilizes the GK·GMP complex by 1.7 kcal/mol, the ternary complex by 1.8 kcal/mol, and the transition state by 4.6 kcal/mol. Tyr-78 is not essential for proper folding of GK but it contributes to the conformational stability by 1.0 kcal/mol. In addition, we have demonstrated that GK undergoes conformational and dynamic changes upon binding of GMP.

Thus it is of biomedical significance to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and the structural basis of nucleotide specificity. Human GK has been recently cloned (8Fitzgibbon J.

However, the human enzyme is inactive when it is expressed inEscherichia coli or produced by cell-free translations (9Brady W.A. Kokoris M.S. Fitzgibbon M. Black M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16734-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have been interested in studying the structure-function relationships of yeast GK because its structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Yeast GK shares ∼50% amino acid identities with the human enzyme. The amino acid residues that interact with the bound GMP (Fig. 1) are strictly conserved not only between the two enzymes but also among all known GKs. Recently we have reported the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the wild-type GK and the roles of Tyr-50 in structure and catalysis (10Li Y. Zhang Y. Yan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28038-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Y. Li Y. Yan H. Structural and Functional Roles of Tyrosine 50 of Yeast Guanylate Kinase: Techniques in Protein Chemistry.in: Marshak D.R. Academic Press, San Diego1997Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In this report we describe characterization of the roles of Tyr-78 by site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with kinetics, two-dimensional NMR, and chemical-induced denaturation. We show that Tyr-78 plays an important role in binding of GMP and catalysis. It also contributes to the conformational stability of GK but it is not important for appropriate folding. In addition, we have examined the conformational and dynamic changes of the WT GK induced by binding of GMP. DISCUSSIONGK belongs to the family of NMP kinases. Among NMP kinases, adenylate kinase has been most extensively studied (25Tsai M.D. Yan H.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6806-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). High resolution crystal structures have been reported for adenylate kinase, GK, and UMP/CMP kinase (24Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

The ATP-binding sites of all known structures are highly conserved. The AMP-binding site of adenylate kinase and the UMP/CMP-binding site of UMP/CMP kinase are also very similar. On the other hand, the chain fold of the GMP-binding domain of GK is grossly different from those of the NMP-binding domains of adenylate kinase and UMP/CMP kinase (24Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The AMP-binding domain and the UMP/CMP-binding domain are completely α-helical. In contrast, the GMP-binding domain is composed of a four-stranded β-sheet and only a short helix (Fig. 1). While only two arginine residues are involved in binding the phosphate moiety of the NMP in adenylate kinase or UMP/CMP kinase, the phosphate moiety of the bound GMP in GK interacts with a pair of tyrosine residues as well as a pair of arginine residues. In this study, we have focused on the structural and functional roles of Tyr-78. Substitution of Tyr-78 with a phenylalanine caused a decrease in k cat by a factor of 131 and increases inK m and K i for GMP by a factor of ∼20, and little changes in K m andK i for MgATP. The mutation also resulted in a decrease in the stability of the enzyme by ∼1.0 kcal/mol. Since the changes in the kinetic properties and conformational stability could be due to global structural perturbations, we have compared the conformation of the mutant with that of the WT GK by NMR. Detailed analysis of the two-dimensional spectra of the aromatic protons has indicated that there are only a few small changes (<0.05 ppm) in the chemical shifts in the mutant spectra at the free state, and all the interresidue NOEs except a weak one are retained. The results suggest that Y78F is appropriately folded and its conformation is highly similar to that of the WT GK. The decrease in conformational stability is not likely the result of global structural changes. Comparison of the two-dimensional spectra of the GMP-bound forms has indicated that there are some large changes in the chemical shifts (Tyr-50 and Fa, >0.1 ppm). Since both Tyr-78 and Tyr-50 are hydrogen-bonded to the phosphate of GMP (24Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossre"

Here we report that overexpression of REC2 induced apoptotic cell death in human HuH-7, Hep G2, and Hep 3B hepatoma cells. Apoptosis was related to recombinase activity and was significantly increased by inhibition of retinoblastoma (Rb) expression with transforming growth factor-β1. REC2-induced apoptosis was associated with a significantly reduced percentage of cells in the G1phase of the cell cycle and a significant reduction in G2/M only in theRb( − / − )Hep 3B cells. Overexpression of REC2 resulted in increased abundance of the hyperphosphorylated form of Rb. However, by immunoprecipitation REC2 was associated primarily with hypophosphorylated Rb, suggesting that REC2 may be involved in modulating the phosphorylation state of Rb.

Taken together, these data suggest a novel interaction of Rb with the recombinase REC2 and a role for this complex in bridging DNA recombination and apoptosis. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that is involved in regulating progression through the cell cycle (1Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). It is hypophosphorylated in the quiescent state and early G1 where it blocks cell cycle progression. Phosphorylation of Rb is initiated during mid to late G1, and it becomes fully phosphorylated prior to the G1-S phase transition. Moreover, the phosphorylation status of Rb is also involved in modulating its ability to associate and/or bind with other cellular and viral factors. In fact, the number of partner proteins that interact with Rb has increased dramatically in recent years and includes certain viral proteins (2Phelps W.C. Yee C.L. Münger K. Howley P.M.

In addition to its central role in regulating the cell cycle, it has been shown that Rb is involved in the TGF-β1-associated 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSH, glutathione.apoptotic pathway in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells (7Fan G. Xu R. Wessendorf M.W. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1463-1476PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of TGF-β1 to induce apoptosis in these cells was associated with decreased phosphorylation of Rb as well as reduced expression. Depletion of Rb by antisense oligonucleotides also resulted in cell death, whereas overexpression of the protein protected against TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a eukaryotic recombinase REC2 was cloned from the fungusUstilago maydis and shown to play an essential role in facilitating homologous recombination with high target specificity as well as recombinational repair following DNA damage (9Rubin B.P. Ferguson D.O. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6287-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 991-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 11Kmiec E.B. Cole A. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7163-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that the REC2 gene product shares a significant region of homology with the Escherichia coliRecA protein, comprising an amino acid stretch of conserved residues that span an ATP binding domain (9Rubin B.P. Ferguson D.O. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6287-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The region is essential for biological activity of RecA in recombination as well as in homologous pairing reactions performed in vitro. The requirement of functional REC2 for these biochemical pathways has facilitated the isolation of recombinase-deficient mutants, thus aiding in the characterization of the mechanisms involved in recombination and repair (9Rubin B.P. Ferguson D.O. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6287-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, the role of DNA recombinases in cell growth and survival is largely uncharacterized. In this study we examined the effect of REC2 overexpression on the growth characteristics of several human hepatoma cell lines. Our results indicate that overexpression of REC2 is associated with an increase in apoptosis that is regulated in part by the level of recombinase activity. In addition, the response is modulated by Rb, which binds REC2 directly, thereby suggesting a role for this complex in bridging DNA repair and apoptosis. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, grown at 37 °C, and transfected as described previously (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wick M.J. Fan G. Loh H.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of each expression plasmid pCMV.CAT, pCMV.REC2, pCMV.REC2-10, and pCMV.REC2-5 (9Rubin B.P. Ferguson D.O. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6287-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and pCMV.Rb (13Qin X.-Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was transfected into the cell lines using Lipofectin™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 36 h, 1 nm TGF-β1 was added to the cultures, which were then maintained for an additional 30 h. Transfection efficiency was monitored by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression and fluorescence labeling of the transfected gene products. Morphological evaluation of apoptosis was carried out as described (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar). A minimum of 300–500 cells were counted for each culture, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined from at least three independent experiments. For immunohistochemical analysis, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, at room temperature for 10 min. Following three washes with PBS, they were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against U. maydisREC2 (2.5 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 5% normal goat serum, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained using Hoechst dye 33258 (1 μg/ml) for 5 min. The images were acquired, and the nuclear morphology was evaluated as described previously (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of REC2 expression were quantitated by gray scale using the MetaMorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corp.). High and low level expressions of REC2 were arbitrarily determined based on two standard deviations of apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells. The mean gray values for high and low expression of REC2 were 9494.2 ± 2831.7 and 750.9 ± 244.2, respectively (p < 0.0001). REC2–5 expression by gray scale analysis was 8949.9 ± 1129.8. For each determination, greater than 300 fields were examined. Statistical analysis was performed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Stable REC2 transfectants of Hep G2 and Hep 3B cells were established using the pCMV.REC2 construct containing a neomycin resistance gene. The transfected cells were selected using G418 (800 μg/ml), and the resulting clonal cells were maintained in G418 at 400 μg/ml. REC2 positive cells were identified by immunohistochemistry as outlined above, and the positive clonal lines from the Hep 3B or Hep G2 transfectants were pooled and expanded. Whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (7Fan G. Xu R. Wessendorf M.W. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1463-1476PubMed Google Scholar) using monoclonal anti-Rb XZ161 and polyclonal anti-REC2 antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation using anti-Rb XZ161 monoclonal antibody or anti-REC2 polyclonal antibody was performed as outlined (14Fan G. Steer C.J. Adv.

The proteins were detected using the ECL™ Chemiluminescence System (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Rb fusion proteins included amino acids 379–792, 379–928, 379–928 with the missense C706F mutation, 379–928 with exon 22 deletion (amino acids 733–769), 379–928 with exon 21 deletion (amino acids 701–733), 403–816, 379–792 with deletion of amino acids 573–645 (16Kaelin Jr., W.G.

(17Sterner J.M. Murata Y. Goo Kim H. Kennett S.B. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9281-9288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed inE. coli and purified by chromatography using glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose (Pharmacia). Recombinant REC2 protein was isolated fromE. coli (11Kmiec E.B. Cole A. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7163-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cell extracts from the REC2- or control vector-transfected Hep 3B cells were freshly prepared as described previously (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed as follows: 20 μg of REC2 in NETN buffer (18Hagemeier C. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was incubated with either the GSH-Sepharose beads alone, GST (20 μg) + GSH-Sepharose beads, or the GST-Rb proteins (∼20 μg protein) + GSH-Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight with rotation. The beads were then washed four times with NETN buffer, resuspended in denaturing buffer, and boiled for 4 min. After brief centrifugation, the supernatants were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer, the Western blots were incubated with polyclonal anti-REC2 antibody, and the proteins detected using the ECL™ Chemiluminescence System. GST-Rb (379–928) beads were incubated with extracts derived fromREC2-transfected Hep 3B cells and analyzed as described above. HuH-7 cells andRb( − / − ) Hep 3B cells (19Puisieux A. Galvin K. Troalen F. Bressac B. Marcais C. Galun E. Ponchel F. Yakicier C. Ji J. Ozturk M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were transfected with 5 μg of either pCMV.REC2 or pCMV vector for 36 h. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar), except the samples also included the detached cells. To identify the effects of REC2 on cell growth and survival, Hep G2 human hepatoma cells were transfected with an expression construct containing the full-length REC2 gene from U. maydis under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Immunofluorescent labeling with anti-REC2 antibody revealed that overexpression of REC2 was associated with cell blebbing, nuclear fragmentation, and subsequent cell death by apoptosis (Fig.1 A, d–f). Apoptosis was also observed with overexpression of REC2-10 (T697A) (Fig. 1 A, g–i), a recombinase-active missense mutant defective in the putative cdc2 kinase association motif (9Rubin B.P. Ferguson D.O. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6287-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, similar overexpression of the recombinase-inactive missense mutant REC2-5 (D234A) did not induce apoptosis (Fig. 1 A, j–l). The same results were observed when the wild type and the two missense REC2 mutants were overexpressed in rat primary hepatocytes (data not shown). Previous studies indicated that the Rb gene product protected hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells from apoptosis induced by TGF-β1 (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the high levels of endogenous Rb expressed in HuH-7 cells (7Fan G. Xu R. Wessendorf M.W. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1463-1476PubMed Google Scholar) could modulate REC2-induced apoptosis. We characterized cells expressing two significantly different levels of the transfected REC2 protein. HuH-7 cells with low level expression of REC2 displayed a morphologically normal nuclear appearance (Fig. 1 B, a–c). In contrast, cells with higher level expression of REC2 exhibited nuclear blebbing and fragmentation similar to that observed in the transiently transfected Hep G2 cells (Fig. 1 B,d–f). Cell cycle analysis was performed on pCMV.REC2-transfected HuH-7 cells as well as on transfected Hep 3B cells, aRb( − / − )human hepatoma cell line (19Puisieux A. Galvin K. Troalen F. Bressac B. Marcais C. Galun E. Ponchel F. Yakicier C. Ji J. Ozturk M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that a “sub-G1” cell population of apoptotic cells (20Ormerod M.G. Collins M.K.L. Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Robertson D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 153: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Schmid I. Uittenbogaart C.H. Giorgi J.V. Cytometry. 1994; 15: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) increased significantly (p < 0.001) in bothREC2 transiently transfected cell lines (TableI). However, the percentage of Hep 3B cells in sub-G1 increased 4-fold compared with a 2.7-fold increase observed in the transfected HuH-7 cells. Both cell lines exhibited significant decreases in G1 cell populations, but the decrease was 2-fold greater in Hep 3B than HuH-7 cells. The S phase populations in both cell lines were unchanged by overexpression of REC2. Interestingly, only the Hep 3B cells showed a decrease in the G2/M phase cell population relative to control (p < 0.001) (Table I). These data suggested that expression of Rb may affect the ability of REC2 to promote apoptosis as well as alter the phase of the cell cycle that exits into apoptosis.Table IDistribution of the cell cycle phases in REC2-transfected HuH-7 and Hep 3B cellsHuH-7Hep 3BpCMVpCMV.REC2pCMVpCMV.REC2G150.9 ± 1.544.9 ± 0.81-ap < 0.05 relative to controls.49.0 ± 0.636.6 ± 0.71-bp < 0.001 relative to controls.S28.7 ± 0.627.7 ± 1.124.3 ± 0.824.9 ± 1.6G2/M16.4 ± 3.016.9 ± 1.020.0 ± 0.411.4 ± 1.11-bp < 0.001 relative to controls.Sub-G13.9 ± 0.710.5 ± 0.81-bp < 0.001 relative to controls.6.6 ± 0.427.3 ± 0.41-bp < 0.001 relative to controls.Results are the means ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments expressed as the percentage of total cells in the designated phase of the cell cycle determined by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a p < 0.05 relative to controls.1-b p < 0.001 relative to controls. Open table in a new tab Results are the means ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments expressed as the percentage of total cells in the designated phase of the cell cycle determined by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The induction of apoptosis in HuH-7 cells has been linked to decreased Rb expression and/or inactivation (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if overexpressed REC2 binds Rb during the cell cycle, the interaction could be a potential trigger for REC2-induced apoptosis. In fact, Western blot analyses demonstrated that stable expression of REC2 in Hep G2 cells resulted in an increase of the hyperphosphorylated inactive form of Rb from approximately 10 to 60% (Fig. 2, A andC). Meanwhile, those selected clones no longer exhibited extensive apoptosis, suggesting that compensatory changes had occurred. The up-regulation of Rb steady-state levels may, in fact, be a compensatory mechanism(s) required for survival with overexpression of the recombinase. However, by immunoprecipitation with anti-REC2 polyclonal antibody, only the hypophosphorylated Rb species was associated with REC2 (Fig. 2 B). Immunoprecipitation using the anti-Rb monoclonal antibody XZ161 also established the presence of REC2 in this complex (Fig. 2 D). The results suggested that REC2 binds Rb either directly or indirectly through a bridge protein and appears to modulate its phosphorylation state promoting accumulation of the functionally inactive hyperphosphorylated Rb. In vitro binding assays were performed (22Wang C.-Y. Petryniak B. Thompson C.B. Kaelin W.G. Leiden J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1330-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) to confirm binding between the REC2 and Rb proteins and to identify the putative REC2 binding region in Rb. Recombinant GST-Rb fusion proteins containing different regions of Rb (Fig.3 B) were bound to GSH-Sepharose and used as an affinity reagent for recombinant REC2 protein purified from E. coli (11Kmiec E.B. Cole A. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7163-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The results established that REC2 bound to the GST-Rb fusion proteins (Fig. 3 A) but not to the GST-Sepharose nor the beads alone. Binding required the Rb A and B pocket domains as well as the spacer sequence (lanes 1and 3–6). In fact, deletion of the spacer region abolished binding (lane 7), whereas three naturally occurring Rb loss-of-function alleles with alterations in the B pocket domain consisting of exon 22 deletion (lane 4), exon 21 deletion (lane 5), or a missense mutation (C706F) (lane 3) only decreased REC2 binding activity. The strongest binding between REC2 and Rb required the Rb carboxyl-terminal region in addition to the pocket domains and spacer sequence (lane 2). Finally, REC2 did not bind to the Rb amino-terminal region (lane 8). Thein vitro binding assay also confirmed that the REC2 present in the lysate from the transfected Hep 3B cells was capable of binding to the GST-Rb (379–928) fusion protein containing the A and B pocket domains, spacer sequence, and carboxyl terminus (Fig.3 C). These results indicated that REC2 binds to the regions of Rb that have been identified for binding of the viral proteins SV40 T antigen, E1A, HPV E7, and Rep A (2Phelps W.C. Yee C.L. Münger K.

Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, only the E2F transcription factors require both the A and B pocket domains as well as the carboxyl-terminal region of Rb for high affinity binding. In addition, protein sequence alignment analysis demonstrated that neither the REC2 nor the E2F proteins contain the Rb-binding motif LXCXE previously identified in the viral E1A, large T, E7, and Rep A transforming protein products (2Phelps W.C. Yee C.L. Münger K. Howley P.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 539-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 3Figge J. Webster T. Smith T.F. Paucha E. J.

Therefore, REC2 and the E2F transcription factors require similar structural domains of the Rb protein for maximal binding. We next determined whether the interaction between REC2 and Rb was involved in the Rb-mediated apoptotic pathway. High level overexpression of REC2 in HuH-7 cells was associated with apoptosis in 24.0% of cells compared with less than 0.4% in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid-transfected controls (Figs.4 and5 B). In addition, overexpression of the recombinase-active REC2-10 mutant allele was also associated with significantly increased apoptosis (p < 0.001). In contrast, the recombinase-inactiveREC2-5 mutant allele did not induce apoptosis. Interestingly, it also exhibited no detectable binding to Rb in Hep G2 cells (Fig. 6) despite high level overexpression of the protein. When the REC2-overexpressing HuH-7 cells were incubated with 1 nm TGF-β1, which inhibits Rb expression and phosphorylation (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar), REC2-induced apoptosis was significantly increased (p < 0.001) in both wild type and REC2-10-transfected cells (Fig. 4). However, in the wild type REC2-transfected cells the increase in apoptosis was significantly greater (∼20%) than the sum of the individual inducers (Figs. 4 and 5, A and B). These data suggested that Rb expression modulates a TGF-β1/REC2 apoptotic pathway(s) and that the putative association of REC2 with CDK may be involved in the induction of apoptosis. Because loss of functional Rb results in apoptosis in these cells (8Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar), we determined whether alterations in the Rb levels would modulate the increased apoptosis observed in TGF-β1-treated REC2-transfected cells.Figure 5Overexpression of wild type Rb inhibits REC2-induced apoptosis in transiently transfected HuH-7 cells.

The expression plasmids REC2 and REC2–5 were transfected into Hep G2 cells for 36 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were harvested, and whole cell lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation with either anti-Rb monoclonal antibody XZ161 or polyclonal anti-REC2 antibody. The resulting precipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-REC2 antibody and the ECL™ Chemiluminescence System.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When co-overexpressed in HuH-7 cells, Rb inhibited TGF-β1 as well as REC2-induced apoptosis by an average of 74.0% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, an 82% decrease (p < 0.001) in the percentage of apoptosis was observed in the cells overexpressing both REC2 and Rb that were also treated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 5, A and B). These data coupled with that from the REC2-10 mutant imply that the interactive effect of TGF-β1 and REC2 is likely mediated by Rb and that the putative association of CDK with REC2 may be involved in modulating the phosphorylation state of Rb. The inability of theREC2-5 recombinase-deficient mutant to bind Rb and induce apoptosis in either HuH-7 cells or primary rat hepatocytes suggests that Rb potentially monitors the level of recombinase activity during the cell cycle. Cells with an abnormal increase in REC2 activity may then, in part, be regulated via apoptosis. Our results support a novel link between DNA recombination and apoptosis in which Rb appears to be involved. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that the tumor suppressor p53 associates with Rad51, a human homolog of REC2, and suppresses spontaneous homologous recombination (24Stürzbecher H.-W.

https://openalex.org/W2039613571,"The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase molecules have been shown to exist in two conformations (A and B) that result from intermolecular interaction of ATPase molecules (Nakamura, J., and Tajima, G. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 17350–17354). The A form binds two calcium ions noncooperatively, whereas the B form binds the calcium ions cooperatively. Here, we examined the independence of these two forms in the calcium-activated hydrolysis of acetyl phosphate (AcP) under asynchronous and synchronous conditions of theirE 1-E 2 transitions at 0–5 and 25 °C. Irrespective of their synchronism and temperature, the two forms hydrolyzed AcP due to calcium that was bound to each of the forms, indicating the independence of the two forms in hydrolyzing AcP. Taking into account the monomer-dimer transition of the ATPase molecules on the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane accompanyingE 1-E 2 transition of the molecules (Dux, L., Taylor, K. A., Ting-Beall, H. P., and Martonosi, A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11730–11743), the two types of molecules seem to independently carry out such monomer-dimer transition of the same type of molecules. Two pairs, each consisting of the same type of molecules, are suggested to be the structural unit of the ATPase molecules. The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase molecules have been shown to exist in two conformations (A and B) that result from intermolecular interaction of ATPase molecules (Nakamura, J., and Tajima, G.

Two pairs, each consisting of the same type of molecules, are suggested to be the structural unit of the ATPase molecules. Ca2+-ATPase is an integral membrane protein (110 kDa) of the SR 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; AcP, acetyl phosphate; AcPase, acetyl phosphatase; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). and is a calcium pump protein that transports 2 mol of calcium ion across the SR membrane by hydrolytic coupling with 1 mol of ATP (1Tada M. Yamamoto T. Tonomura Y. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 56: 1-79Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Ikemoto N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 44: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3de Meis L. Inesi G. Carafori E. Membrane Transport of Calcium. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1982: 141-186Google Scholar). Calcium binding to the two calcium transport sites of the ATPase, being required for phosphorylation of ATPase, is a crucial step in driving the calcium pump. The formation of 1 mol of phosphorylated ATPase and its isomerization are coincident with this calcium transport. Relationships between the structure and function of the calcium-transporting ATPase are being actively investigated (4Clark D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 5Inesi G. Sumbilla C. Kirtley M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, from observations of the calcium sensitivity of intrinsic fluorescence intensity in the ATPase protein molecules and of calcium binding to the molecules, the ATPase molecules have been shown to exist in two conformations that have the same amino acid sequence (6Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, for the sake of simplicity, we name the two conformations A form and B form, respectively. The two forms independently bind two calcium ions in a different manner (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): the A form noncooperatively binds two calcium ions with a pH-independent affinity for the ions, whereas the B form cooperatively binds the calcium ions with a pH-dependent affinity for the ions. Recently, however, these nonequivalences of the two forms have been shown to be canceled by solubilization of the ATPase molecules in the SR membrane with detergent, suggesting that intermolecular interaction of the ATPase molecules produces such nonequivalences (8Nakamura J. Tajima G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17350-17354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We therefore further examined the independence of these forms in transporting calcium ions by coupling with hydrolysis of a substrate as an energy source. As to the intermolecular interaction of the ATPase molecules in the SR, Duxet al. (9Dux L. Taylor K.A. Ting-Beall H.P. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11730-11743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found “monomer ribbon-dimer ribbon” transition in the array of molecules on the SR membrane, which coincides with E 1 (high affinity state of the molecule for calcium)-E 2 (low affinity state of the molecule for calcium) transition. The transition of the molecules from E 2 into E 1 has been found to be the slowest step of the transport sequence in the absence of a higher concentration of ATP than that required for phosphorylation of the ATPase molecule (10Scofano H.M. Vieyra A. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the A form is in pH-dependent equilibrium betweenE 1 and E 2, before calcium binding, whereas the B form pre-exists predominantly inE 2 independent of pH (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transition rates of the two forms from E 2 toE 1 were previously found to be the same, independent of temperature (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, the enzyme states of the two forms before calcium binding were set atE 1 and E 2 and atE 2 only, respectively, by setting the pH at specified values, to drive their hydrolysis reaction asynchronously and synchronously, respectively. Moreover, the experimental temperature was varied to carry out the experiments under different conditions of stability of the intermolecular interaction of the ATPase molecules. We then examined whether the two forms independently hydrolyze a substrate due to calcium that is bound to each of the forms; the total activity of substrate hydrolysis by the two forms was compared with calcium binding to the forms in the absence of the substrate by varying the calcium concentration. For direct comparison of the activity and the binding, it is necessary to use a substrate that supports calcium transport and that does not have any regulatory effect on the calcium binding and the enzymatic reaction. AcP has been shown to support calcium transport that couples with its hydrolysis (11de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 343-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), like ATP. Unlike ATP, however, it has not been shown to have a regulatory effect on E 1-E 2 transition in its hydrolysis cycle (12Pucell A. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bodley A.L. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13997-14004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, its effect on calcium binding is not known. In this study, we first clarified that AcP had no effect on calcium binding and then used it as the substrate. The results show that the two forms hydrolyze AcP due to calcium that is bound to each of the forms, irrespective of temperature and synchronism of their hydrolysis cycles, indicating the independence of the two forms in hydrolyzing AcP. Based on the monomer-dimer transition of the ATPase molecules on the SR membrane (9Dux L. Taylor K.A. Ting-Beall H.P. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11730-11743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the structural unit of the molecules is discussed. The procedures for isolation of the SR from the skeletal muscle of rabbit were the same as those described in a previous paper (14Nakamura J. Endo Y. Konishi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 18: 108-113Google Scholar). Membranous Ca2+-ATPase was purified from the SR by washing the SR with sodium deoxycholate in the same manner as reported previously (15Nakamura J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in a 1:5 ratio of sodium deoxycholate to the reticulum protein. The maximum calcium binding capacity of the ATPase preparation was 9.0–10.7 nmol/mg of protein as estimated by Scatchard analysis of the calcium titration curve of the calcium-binding sites in the preparation, and the maximum level of the preparation that was phosphorylated with ATP was 4.2–4.6 nmol/mg of protein obtained in 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.0. The purified ATPase preparation exhibited the same characteristics of calcium binding as those of the ATPase preparation (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Figs. 1 and 2) that was purified by solubilization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with sodium deoxycholate and by reformation of the membranous ATPase by removal of the detergent (data not shown).Figure 2Calcium binding in the absence of AcP at pH 6.23 and 0 °C (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A, total calcium titration curves of the two types of ATPase molecules. Calcium binding to the A form (×), which is in a state ofE 1/E 2 dependent on pH and pre-exists in E 2 at this acidic pH, was obtained by subtracting the binding to the B form (– – –), which pre-exists in E 2 independent of pH, from the total binding (○). Calcium binding to the B form was simulated by using parameters of n H = 2.0 and K 0.5 = 5.3 μm, obtained on the basis of the observations of the calcium-dependent change in fluorescence intensity of the molecule and maximum binding capacity = half (4.9 nmol/mg of protein) of the capacity (9.8 nmol/mg of protein) of the observed total binding (cf. “Discussion” in Ref. 7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). B, Hill plots of the total binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The total AcP hydrolysis activity of the ATPase was carried out in 20 mm PIPES buffer solution (pH 6.23 or 7.40) containing 0.1 or 0.5 mg of ATPase protein/ml, 0.12m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmAcP, and 0.01–1000 μm Ca2+ at 5 or 25 °C. To obtain reproducible values of the activities at these pH values and temperatures, the reaction times in which the reactions were linear and the protein concentrations of the ATPase were set at 3 (at pH 7.40) or 5 (at pH 6.23) h and 0.5 mg of protein/ml at 5 °C and at 30 (at pH 7.40) or 60 (at pH 6.23) min and 0.1 mg of protein/ml at 25 °C, respectively, based on the following observations. (i) The AcPase activities at pH 6.23 were about half of those at pH 7.40. (ii) The activities at 5 °C were one-thirtieth to one-fortieth of those at 25 °C. (iii) No inactivation of the activity was observed when the ATPase was preincubated in the absence of AcP for 2 and 6 h at 25 and 5 °C, respectively, which is different from the case (8Nakamura J. Tajima G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17350-17354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) of the detergent-solubilized ATPase, which was gradually inactivated during the preincubation. The calcium-independent activity of AcP hydrolysis was determined under identical conditions, except that 5 mmEGTA was added without the addition of calcium. The calcium-dependent activity of AcP hydrolysis (Ca2+-AcPase activity) was obtained by subtracting the calcium-independent activity from the total activity. The amount of remaining AcP was determined according to the method of Lipmann and Tuttle (16Lipmann F. Tuttle L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 159: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Before reading the absorbance at 505 nm of the brown complex formed with iron(III), the ATPase protein suspended in the medium for the assay of AcP was removed by centrifugation (1000 ×g for 5 min). Calcium binding was performed according to the rapid filtration method (17Dupont Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) at 0 °C as described previously (18Nakamura J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A Millipore HA filter (0.45-μm pore size) was used. The ATPase preparation (0.2 mg of protein/ml) was preincubated in 20 mm PIPES buffer solution (pH 6.23 or 7.40) containing 0.12m KCl and 5 mm MgCl2 without the addition of CaCl2. Aliquots (1 ml) of the ATPase suspension were placed on the filter. After removal of calcium that was bound to the ATPase by washing it on the filter with EGTA, calcium binding to the calcium-unbound ATPase was initiated by washing the ATPase on the filter with binding solution containing various concentrations of45Ca2+ and having the same pH buffer as that used in the preincubation of the ATPase, as described previously (19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17029-17031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association constants for EGTA-calcium at the employed pH values of 6.23 and 7.40 were 6.31 × 104 and 1.38 × 107m−1, respectively (20Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In the presence of 5 mm AcP, calcium accumulation in the ATPase membrane vesicles was observed. After the calcium that was bound to the ATPase preparation reached equilibrium in the absence of AcP, the preparation further took up calcium at a rate of 2–4 nmol/mg of protein/min when AcP was added. The calcium that was taken up with the help of AcP was completely released by the addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 (data not shown). Therefore, the amount of calcium that was bound to the ATPase in the presence of AcP was obtained by subtracting the amount of the accumulated calcium from the amount of total calcium that was taken up by the membrane vesicles. We previously showed that two different conformations (A and B) of chemically equivalent Ca2+-ATPase molecules exist in the SR membrane at a ratio of 1:1 (6Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They independently bind two calcium ions (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): the A form binds the ions noncooperatively, whereas the B form binds the ions cooperatively (Figs.1 and 2). Recently, however, these two forms have been shown to result from intermolecular interaction of the ATPase molecules (8Nakamura J. Tajima G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17350-17354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here, we therefore further examined the independence of the two forms in transporting calcium by hydrolytic coupling of a substrate as an energy source. To examine this point, we compared the calcium dependence of the total hydrolysis activity of the two forms with calcium binding to the forms in the absence of the substrate. The comparison was carried out to elucidate whether these forms independently hydrolyze the substrate due to calcium that is bound to each of the forms. For this comparison, it is necessary to use a substrate that reacts with the ATPase molecules to transport calcium across the SR membrane and that does not have any regulatory effect, other than that as a substrate for the molecules, on their respective calcium binding and hydrolysis. AcP has been shown to support calcium transport (11de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 343-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and to have no regulatory effect on the turnover of AcP hydrolysis (12Pucell A. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bodley A.L. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13997-14004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether AcP affects calcium binding. In Fig.3, we therefore first examined calcium binding in the absence and presence of 5 mm AcP at pH 7.40 and 0 °C. As reported previously (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at this pH and temperature, it is thought that the A form is in E 1 before calcium binding and apparently rapidly binds calcium, whereas the B form pre-exists in E 2 and apparently slowly binds calcium. Two such calcium binding reactions were observed in the absence of AcP at 10.3 μm Ca2+; ∼41% (3.5 nmol/mg of protein) of the calcium (8.5 nmol/mg of protein) that was bound at equilibrium was rapidly bound to the A form, which pre-existed in E 1, within the dead time (∼2 s) of our experiments. The remaining 59% (5.0 nmol/mg of protein) of the bound calcium was slowly and monoexponentially bound to the B form, which pre-existed in E 2, at a rate oft½ ∼ 4 s. At a lower calcium concentration of 0.12 μm, only slow (t½ ∼ 4 s) calcium binding to the B form was observed. These calcium binding reactions were not affected by AcP at all, showing that there is no significant effect of this amount of AcP on calcium binding. As to the intermolecular interaction of the ATPase molecules, monomer ribbon-dimer ribbon transition in the array of molecules on the SR membrane has been found to coincide withE 1-E 2 transition of the molecules (9Dux L. Taylor K.A. Ting-Beall H.P. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11730-11743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transition from E 2 toE 1 has been shown to be the slowest step of the transport sequence in the absence of a higher concentration of ATP than that required for phosphorylation of the ATPase molecule (10Scofano H.M. Vieyra A. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the two forms of the ATPase molecules have been shown to be in different enzyme states before calcium binding dependent on pH (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): at pH 7.40, the A form is in E 1 and the B form is in E 2, whereas at pH 6.23, both of the forms are predominantly in E 2. The transition rates of the two forms from E 2 toE 1 were previously shown to be the same, independent of temperature (7Nakamura J. J. Biol.

Here, therefore, the enzyme states of the two forms before calcium binding were set atE 1 and E 2 and atE 2 only, by setting the pH at 7.40 and 6.23, to drive their hydrolysis reaction asynchronously and synchronously, respectively. Moreover, the experiments were carried out at 5 and 25 °C to assay the AcPase activity of the two forms under different conditions of stability of the intermolecular interaction of the ATPase molecules. As mentioned above, because of the split of the two forms intoE 1 and E 2 at pH 7.40, these forms are thought to asynchronously turn over their cycles of AcP hydrolysis reaction at this pH. In Figs.4 A and 5 A, the total Ca2+-AcPase activity, which is composed of the AcPase activities of the two forms, was examined by varying the calcium concentration and temperature at the mentioned pH. At 25 °C, Hill plots of the total AcPase activity as a function of calcium concentration were biphasic (Fig. 4 B). The two lines of the plots, the slopes of which were ∼0.9 and 1.7, respectively, intersected near the zero point of the ordinate, suggesting the existence of two different types of AcP hydrolysis reaction with the same level of maximum activities. The calcium concentration for the half-maximum activity (K 0.5) was ∼0.2 μm. In a previous paper (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that at pH 7.40 and 0 °C, the A form, which pre-exists in E 1, noncooperatively (Hill value (n H) ∼ 1) binds calcium with an apparent calcium affinity (calcium concentration for the half-maximum binding (K 0.5)) of ∼2.0 μm, whereas the B form, which pre-exists inE 2, cooperatively (n H ∼ 2) binds calcium with a K 0.5 of ∼0.2 μm (Fig. 1, A and B). Hill plots of the total binding, which is composed of the binding to the two forms at a ratio of 1:1, were biphasic, with slopes of ∼0.8 and 1.8. The two lines of the Hill plots also intersected near the zero point of the ordinate. The K 0.5 of the total binding was ∼0.4 μm. This profile of the total binding is very close to that of the total Ca2+-AcPase activity at 25 °C, which is shown in Fig. 4. The profile of the total binding at 0 °C was not affected by increasing the temperature to 25 °C (data not shown). At 25 °C, calcium has been found to be rapidly bound to the ATPase molecules at the same millisecond rate irrespective of their enzyme states (E 1 andE 2) before calcium binding (21Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results therefore suggest that at a temperature of 25 °C, the two forms equally and independently hydrolyze AcP due to calcium that is bound to each of the forms in a different manner. It was previously shown that at 0 °C, the A form, which pre-exists in E 1, apparently rapidly (t < 2 s) binds calcium, whereas the B form, which pre-exists in E 2, slowly (t½ > 2 s) binds calcium (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the above discussion of independent AcP hydrolysis by the two forms, it is therefore likely that at a lower temperature, the A form, which rapidly binds calcium, more rapidly turns over its hydrolysis cycle than the B form, which slowly binds calcium. This possibility was examined in Fig.5 A, in which the calcium dependence of the total AcPase activity was studied at 5 °C. Almost all of the Hill plots of the total activity were monophasic, with a slope of 0.9–1.3, although a small deviation from the linear line was observed (Fig. 5 B). The slope (0.9–1.3) of the main portion in the Hill plots is near the n H value (∼1) of the binding to the A form, which pre-exists inE 1, whereas the slope (>2) of the minor portion is rather near the n H value (∼2) of the binding to the B form, which pre-exists in E 2(cf. Fig. 1 B). These results support the above discussion of independent AcP hydrolysis by the two forms at pH 7.40, where the forms asynchronously turn over their hydrolysis cycles.Figure 5Calcium dependence of the Ca2+-AcPase activity at pH 7.40 and 5 °C.

At this acidic pH, as mentioned before, it is thought that the A and B forms synchronously turn over their cycle of AcP hydrolysis reaction because they are in the same enzyme states of E 2 before calcium binding. As shown in a previous paper (7Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at this acidic pH, the A form noncooperatively (n H ∼ 1) binds calcium with aK 0.5 of ∼7 μm, whereas the B form cooperatively (n H ∼ 2) binds calcium with a K 0.5 of 2–6 μm (see Fig.2 A). At the low temperature of 0 °C, both of the forms, which pre-exist in E 2, apparently slowly (t½ > 2 s) bind calcium because of their slow transition to E 1. The total binding profile at this pH, which is composed of the binding to the two forms at a ratio of 1:1, was monophasic, with n H ∼ 1.3 and K 0.5 ∼ 5.8 μm (Fig.2 B). Such a profile was not affected by increasing the temperature to 25 °C (data not shown), although the ATPase molecules have been found to equally and rapidly bind calcium at a millisecond rate (21Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 25 °C, Hill plots of the calcium dependence of the total AcPase activity were monophasic, with n H∼ 1.4 and K 0.5 ∼ 5.0 μm (Fig.6 B). The calcium-dependent profile (n H ∼ 1.4 and K 0.5 ∼ 3 μm) of the total AcPase activity at 5 °C (Fig.7 B) was almost the same as that at 25 °C. These profiles were the same as that of the total calcium binding (Fig.2 B), which is composed of the binding to the two forms at a ratio of 1:1. These results suggest that the two forms equally and independently hydrolyze AcP due to the calcium that is bound to each of the forms, even when the forms synchronously turn over their hydrolysis cycles.Figure 7Calcium dependence of the Ca2+-AcPase activity at pH 6.23 and 5 °C.

On the other hand, if the two forms of the ATPase molecules were not independently operating in hydrolyzing AcP, either or both of the following results, which are contrasted with the results actually obtained, would be expected from the experiments carried out here. (i) The calcium-dependent profile of the total AcPase activity, which is composed of the activities of the two forms, would not correspond to that of the total calcium binding, which is composed of the calcium binding to the forms at a ratio of 1:1, under some condition(s) of pH and temperature except the condition of pH 7.40 and 5 °C. (ii) At 7.40, the calcium-dependent profile of the total AcPase activity would correspond to that of the total binding independent of temperature. Taking into account the monomer-dimer transition of the ATPase molecules on the SR membrane accompanyingE 1-E 2 transition of the molecules (9Dux L. Taylor K.A. Ting-Beall H.P. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11730-11743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the conclusion, mentioned above, indicates that the two types of ATPase molecules independently carry out such monomer-dimer transition of the same type of molecules, i.e. a structural unit model in which there are two different pairs of molecules, with each pair consisting of the same type of molecules and in which nonequivalence results from the intermolecular interaction of those molecules. The two-pair model is schematically represented in Fig.8. The concept that at least two types of ATPase molecules are involved in the calcium transport mechanism first emerged from the studies by Froehlich and Taylor (22Froehlich J.P. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2013-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ikemoto et al. (23Ikemoto N. Garcia A.M. Kurobe Y. Scott T.L. J. Biol.

Our results support these earlier reports."
