https://openalex.org/W2118140755,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is among the world’s earliest domesticated and most important crop plants. It is diploid with a large haploid genome of 5.1 gigabases (Gb). Here we present an integrated and ordered physical, genetic and functional sequence resource that describes the barley gene-space in a structured whole-genome context. We developed a physical map of 4.98 Gb, with more than 3.90 Gb anchored to a high-resolution genetic map. Projecting a deep whole-genome shotgun assembly, complementary DNA and deep RNA sequence data onto this framework supports 79,379 transcript clusters, including 26,159 ‘high-confidence’ genes with homology support from other plant genomes. Abundant alternative splicing, premature termination codons and novel transcriptionally active regions suggest that post-transcriptional processing forms an important regulatory layer. Survey sequences from diverse accessions reveal a landscape of extensive single-nucleotide variation. Our data provide a platform for both genome-assisted research and enabling contemporary crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2055912677,"Chronic mucosal inflammation and tissue damage predisposes patients to the development of colorectal cancer. This association could be explained by the hypothesis that the same factors and pathways important for wound healing also promote tumorigenesis. A sensor of tissue damage should induce these factors to promote tissue repair and regulate their action to prevent development of cancer. Interleukin 22 (IL-22), a cytokine of the IL-10 superfamily, has an important role in colonic epithelial cell repair, and its levels are increased in the blood and intestine of inflammatory bowel disease patients. This cytokine can be neutralized by the soluble IL-22 receptor, known as the IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP, also known as IL22RA2); however, the significance of endogenous IL-22BP in vivo and the pathways that regulate this receptor are unknown. Here we describe that IL-22BP has a crucial role in controlling tumorigenesis and epithelial cell proliferation in the colon. IL-22BP is highly expressed by dendritic cells in the colon in steady-state conditions. Sensing of intestinal tissue damage via the NLRP3 or NLRP6 inflammasomes led to an IL-18-dependent downregulation of IL-22BP, thereby increasing the ratio of IL-22/IL-22BP. IL-22, which is induced during intestinal tissue damage, exerted protective properties during the peak of damage, but promoted tumour development if uncontrolled during the recovery phase. Thus, the IL-22-IL-22BP axis critically regulates intestinal tissue repair and tumorigenesis in the colon."

However, simulations of the current giant impact hypothesis for Moon formation find that most lunar material originated from the impactor, which should have had a different isotopic signature. Previous Moon-formation studies assumed that the angular momentum after the impact was similar to that of the present day; however, Earth-mass planets are expected to have higher spin rates at the end of accretion. Here, we show that typical last giant impacts onto a fast-spinning proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming disk derived primarily from Earth's mantle. Furthermore, we find that a faster-spinning early Earth-Moon system can lose angular momentum and reach the present state through an orbital resonance between the Sun and Moon."
https://openalex.org/W2006760510,"Most successful existing vaccines rely on neutralizing antibodies, which may not require specific anatomical localization of B cells. However, efficacious vaccines that rely on T cells for protection have been difficult to develop, as robust systemic memory T-cell responses do not necessarily correlate with host protection. In peripheral sites, tissue-resident memory T cells provide superior protection compared to circulating memory T cells. Here we describe a simple and non-inflammatory vaccine strategy that enables the establishment of a protective memory T-cell pool within peripheral tissue. The female genital tract, which is a portal of entry for sexually transmitted infections, is an immunologically restrictive tissue that prevents entry of activated T cells in the absence of inflammation or infection. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a vaccine strategy that we term 'prime and pull' to establish local tissue-resident memory T cells at a site of potential viral exposure. This approach relies on two steps: conventional parenteral vaccination to elicit systemic T-cell responses (prime), followed by recruitment of activated T cells by means of topical chemokine application to the restrictive genital tract (pull), where such T cells establish a long-term niche and mediate protective immunity. In mice, prime and pull protocol reduces the spread of infectious herpes simplex virus 2 into the sensory neurons and prevents development of clinical disease. These results reveal a promising vaccination strategy against herpes simplex virus 2, and potentially against other sexually transmitted infections such as human immunodeficiency virus."
https://openalex.org/W2156821519,"In the giant impact theory, the Moon formed from debris ejected into an Earth-orbiting disk by the collision of a large planet with the early Earth. Prior impact simulations predict that much of the disk material originates from the colliding planet. However, Earth and the Moon have essentially identical oxygen isotope compositions. This has been a challenge for the impact theory, because the impactor's composition would have likely differed from that of Earth. We simulated impacts involving larger impactors than previously considered. We show that these can produce a disk with the same composition as the planet's mantle, consistent with Earth-Moon compositional similarities. Such impacts require subsequent removal of angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system through a resonance with the Sun as recently proposed."

We combine the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture with spin qubits by coupling an InAs nanowire double quantum dot to a superconducting cavity. We drive single spin rotations using electric dipole spin resonance and demonstrate that photons trapped in the cavity are sensitive to single spin dynamics. The hybrid quantum system allows measurements of the spin lifetime and the observation of coherent spin rotations. Our results demonstrate that a spin-cavity coupling strength of 1 MHz is feasible."

https://openalex.org/W2088778610,"Investigation of neural cells from post-mortem human brains and differentiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells shows that the LRRK2 mutation (G2019S) associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease correlates with abnormalities at the nuclear envelope. The G2019S mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease, but the pathological mechanism involved is unclear. Here, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte and colleagues report that neurons bearing the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation have profound abnormalities at the nuclear envelope. The authors validate this finding in neurons differentiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, as well as in neurons from postmortem brains. These findings associate the nucleus with Parkinson's disease pathology, and have implications for diagnosis and the potential development of targeted therapeutics. Nuclear-architecture defects have been shown to correlate with the manifestation of a number of human diseases as well as ageing1,2,3,4. It is therefore plausible that diseases whose manifestations correlate with ageing might be connected to the appearance of nuclear aberrations over time. We decided to evaluate nuclear organization in the context of ageing-associated disorders by focusing on a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) dominant mutation (G2019S; glycine-to-serine substitution at amino acid 2019), which is associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease as well as impairment of adult neurogenesis in mice5. Here we report on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from Parkinson’s disease patients and the implications of LRRK2(G2019S) mutation in human neural-stem-cell (NSC) populations. Mutant NSCs showed increased susceptibility to proteasomal stress as well as passage-dependent deficiencies in nuclear-envelope organization, clonal expansion and neuronal differentiation. Disease phenotypes were rescued by targeted correction of the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation with its wild-type counterpart in Parkinson’s disease iPSCs and were recapitulated after targeted knock-in of the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation in human embryonic stem cells. Analysis of human brain tissue showed nuclear-envelope impairment in clinically diagnosed Parkinson’s disease patients. Together, our results identify the nucleus as a previously unknown cellular organelle in Parkinson’s disease pathology and may help to open new avenues for Parkinson’s disease diagnoses as well as for the potential development of therapeutics targeting this fundamental cell structure."

https://openalex.org/W2080578479,"Histone chaperones represent a structurally and functionally diverse family of histone-binding proteins that prevent promiscuous interactions of histones before their assembly into chromatin. DAXX is a metazoan histone chaperone specific to the evolutionarily conserved histone variant H3.3. Here we report the crystal structures of the DAXX histone-binding domain with a histone H3.3-H4 dimer, including mutants within DAXX and H3.3, together with in vitro and in vivo functional studies that elucidate the principles underlying H3.3 recognition specificity. Occupying 40% of the histone surface-accessible area, DAXX wraps around the H3.3-H4 dimer, with complex formation accompanied by structural transitions in the H3.3-H4 histone fold. DAXX uses an extended α-helical conformation to compete with major inter-histone, DNA and ASF1 interaction sites. Our structural studies identify recognition elements that read out H3.3-specific residues, and functional studies address the contributions of Gly 90 in H3.3 and Glu 225 in DAXX to chaperone-mediated H3.3 variant recognition specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2037034308,"The human body has a remarkable ability to regulate inflammation, a biophysical response triggered by virus infection and tissue damage. Sirt6 is critical for metabolism and lifespan; however, its role in inflammation is unknown. Here we show that Sirt6-null (Sirt6(-/-)) mice developed chronic liver inflammation starting at ∼2 months of age, and all animals were affected by 7-8 months of age. Deletion of Sirt6 in T cells or myeloid-derived cells was sufficient to induce liver inflammation and fibrosis, albeit to a lesser degree than that in the global Sirt6(-/-) mice, suggesting that Sirt6 deficiency in the immune cells is the cause. Consistently, macrophages derived from the bone marrow of Sirt6(-/-) mice showed increased MCP-1, IL-6, and TNFα expression levels and were hypersensitive to LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, SIRT6 interacts with c-JUN and deacetylates histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) at the promoter of proinflammatory genes whose expression involves the c-JUN signaling pathway. Sirt6-deficient macrophages displayed hyperacetylation of H3K9 and increased occupancy of c-JUN in the promoter of these genes, leading to their elevated expression. These data suggest that Sirt6 plays an anti-inflammatory role in mice by inhibiting c-JUN-dependent expression of proinflammatory genes."
https://openalex.org/W2005658789,"Ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1) catalyzes the synthesis of C18 ceramide and is mainly expressed in the brain. Custom-made antibodies to a peptide from the C-terminal region of the mouse CerS1 protein yielded specific immunosignals in neurons but no other cell types of wild type brain, but the CerS1 protein was not detected in CerS1-deficient mouse brains. To elucidate the biological function of CerS1-derived sphingolipids in the brain, we generated CerS1-deficient mice by introducing a targeted mutation into the coding region of the cers1 gene. General deficiency of CerS1 in mice caused a foliation defect, progressive shrinkage, and neuronal apoptosis in the cerebellum. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed up to 60% decreased levels of gangliosides in cerebellum and forebrain. Expression of myelin-associated glycoprotein was also decreased by about 60% in cerebellum and forebrain, suggesting that interaction and stabilization of oligodendrocytic myelin-associated glycoprotein by neuronal gangliosides is due to the C18 acyl membrane anchor of CerS1-derived precursor ceramides. A behavioral analysis of CerS1-deficient mice yielded functional deficits including impaired exploration of novel objects, locomotion, and motor coordination. Our results reveal an essential function of CerS1-derived ceramide in the regulation of cerebellar development and neurodevelopmentally regulated behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1974786117,"Observations of hard X-rays from the remnant of supernova 1987A in the narrow band containing two direct-escape lines of 44Ti at 67.9 and 78.4 keV imply that this radiation had sufficient energy to power the remnant at late times; the initial mass of 44Ti is estimated to be near the upper bound of theoretical predictions. Theoretical models of the remnants of supernovae predict that after a few years dominated by the decay of the radioisotopes cobalt-56 and cobalt-57, the energy budget is dominated by the radioactive decay of titanium-44 to stable calcium. The decay process involves the emission of X-ray and gamma-ray photons with characteristic energies, but until now these emission lines have been observed unambiguously from only one source, Cassiopeia A, the youngest known supernova remnant in the Milky Way. Now, Sergei Grebenev et al. report the observation of two characteristic hard-X-ray titanium-44 lines in emissions from the remnant of supernova 1987A. Photon-flux measurements made by the INTEGRAL satellite telescope indicate a rate of radioactive decay sufficient to have powered the remnant in recent years, and also provide an estimate for the initial mass of titanium-44 synthesized in the supernova that will help to constrain models of explosive nucleosynthesis. It is assumed1,2,3 that the radioactive decay of 44Ti powers the infrared, optical and ultraviolet emission of supernova remnants after the complete decay of 56Co and 57Co (the isotopes that dominated the energy balance during the first three to four years after the explosion) until the beginning of active interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding matter. Simulations4,5 show that the initial mass of 44Ti synthesized in core-collapse supernovae is (0.02–2.5) × 10−4 solar masses ( ). Hard X-rays and γ-rays from the decay of this 44Ti have been unambiguously observed from Cassiopeia A only6,7,8, leading to the suggestion that values of the initial mass of 44Ti near the upper bound of the predictions occur only in exceptional cases9. For the remnant of supernova 1987A10,11, an upper limit to the initial mass of 44Ti of <10−3 has been obtained from direct X-ray observations12, and an estimate of (1–2) × 10−4 has been made from infrared light curves and ultraviolet spectra by complex and model-dependent computations13,14,15. Here we report observations of hard X-rays from the remnant of supernova 1987A in the narrow band containing two direct-escape lines of 44Ti at 67.9 and 78.4 keV. The measured line fluxes imply that this decay provided sufficient energy to power the remnant at late times. We estimate that the initial mass of 44Ti was (3.1 ± 0.8) × 10−4 , which is near the upper bound of theoretical predictions."

https://openalex.org/W2058335862,"Crime poses a major burden for society. The heterogeneous nature of criminal behavior makes it difficult to unravel its causes. Relatively little research has been conducted on the genetic influences of criminal behavior. The few twin and adoption studies that have been undertaken suggest that about half of the variance in antisocial behavior can be explained by genetic factors. In order to identify the specific common genetic variants underlying this behavior, we conduct the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on adult antisocial behavior. Our sample comprised a community sample of 4816 individuals who had completed a self-report questionnaire. No genetic polymorphisms reached genome-wide significance for association with adult antisocial behavior. In addition, none of the traditional candidate genes can be confirmed in our study. While not genome-wide significant, the gene with the strongest association (p-value = 8.7×10(-5)) was DYRK1A, a gene previously related to abnormal brain development and mental retardation. Future studies should use larger, more homogeneous samples to disentangle the etiology of antisocial behavior. Biosocial criminological research allows a more empirically grounded understanding of criminal behavior, which could ultimately inform and improve current treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2066979310,"The content of flavonoids especially baicalin and baicalein determined the medical quality of Scutellaria baicalensis which is a Chinese traditional medicinal plant. Here, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the content and composition of flavonoids in S. baicalensis under water deficit condition. The transcription levels of several genes which are involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were stimulated by water deficit. Under water deficit condition, fifteen up-regulated proteins, three down-regulated proteins and other six proteins were detected by proteomic analysis. The identified proteins include three gibberellin (GA)- or indoleacetic acid (IAA)-related proteins. Decreased endogenous GAs level and increased IAA level were observed in leaves of S. baicalensis which was treated with water deficit. Exogenous application of GA or α-naphthalene acelic acid (NAA) to plants grown under water deficit conditions led to the increase of endogenous GAs and the decrease of IAA and flavonoids, respectively. When the synthesis pathway of GA or IAA in plants was inhibited by application with the inhibitors, flavonoid levels were recovered. These results indicate that water deficit affected flavonoid accumulation might through regulating hormone metabolism in S. baicalensis Georgi."
https://openalex.org/W2126782904,"Calcium ions are involved in a plethora of cellular functions including cell death and mitochondrial energy metabolism. Store-operated Ca(2+) entry over the plasma membrane is activated by depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores and is mediated by the sensor STIM1 and the channel ORAI1. We compared cell death susceptibility to oxidative stress in STIM1 knock-out and ORAI1 knockdown mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in knock-out cells with reconstituted wild type and dominant active STIM1. We show that STIM1 and ORAI1 deficiency renders cells more susceptible to oxidative stress, which can be rescued by STIM1 and ORAI1 overexpression. STIM1 knock-out mitochondria are tubular, have a higher Ca(2+) concentration, and are metabolically more active, resulting in constitutive oxidative stress causing increased nuclear translocation of the antioxidant transcription factor NRF2 triggered by increased phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α and the protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase PERK. This leads to increased transcription of antioxidant genes and a high basal glutathione in STIM1 knock-out cells, which is, however, more rapidly expended upon additional stress, resulting in increased release and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor with subsequent cell death. Our data suggest that store-operated Ca(2+) entry and STIM1 are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial shape and bioenergetics and play a role in oxidative stress."

The more elaborate autophagic machinery in higher eukaryotes requires Atg proteins and also metazoan-specific autophagy components. Genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans identified epg-4, the Ei24 homolog, as an essential autophagy gene, loss of function of which causes defective autophagic degradation of a variety of protein aggregates during embryogenesis (20.Tian Y. Li Z.P. Hu W.Q. Ren H.Y. Tian E. Zhao Y. Lu Q. Huang X.X. Yang P.G. Li X. Wang X. Kovács A.L. Yu L. Zhang H.

C. elegans screen identifies autophagy genes specific to multicellular organisms.Cell. 2010; 141: 1042-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Ei24 is also essential for starvation-induced autophagy (20.Tian Y. Li Z.P. Hu W.Q. Ren H.Y. Tian E. Zhao Y. Lu Q. Huang X.X. Yang P.G. Li X. Wang X. Kovács A.L. Yu L. Zhang H.

Distinct from the role of epg-4 at the early step of autophagosome formation in C. elegans, knockdown of Ei24 by siRNA results in accumulation of degradation-defective autolysosomes (20.Tian Y. Li Z.P. Hu W.Q. Ren H.Y. Tian E. Zhao Y. Lu Q. Huang X.X. Yang P.G. Li X. Wang X. Kovács A.L. Yu L. Zhang H.

Here we generated mice with tissue-specific deficiency of Ei24. Neural-specific Ei24-deficient mice exhibit massive axonal degeneration and neuronal cell loss in various brain and spinal cord regions. Ei24 deficiency causes vacuolation of oligodendroglial cells. Liver-specific Ei24-deficient mice have hepatocellular enlargement and hepatomegaly. Ei24 deficiency impairs autophagic flux, leading to accumulation of LC3, p62 aggregates, and ubiquitin-positive inclusions. Our study demonstrates that Ei24 is an essential component of basal autophagy in removing aggregate-prone proteins. To construct the Ei24 targeting allele, exon 3 of Ei24 was flanked by two loxP sequences and a neomycin phosphotransferase expression cassette. The targeting vector was electroporated into 129 R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells. Three homologous recombinants were identified by Southern blotting with probes 5′ and 3′ of the genomic sequence present in the targeting vector. Heterozygous Ei24fl/wt ES cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6N blastocysts. Chimeric offspring were backcrossed to C57BL/6N mice. Heterozygous mutant mice were outbred with C57BL/6 mice and interbred to obtain homozygous mutant mice. Cre-mediated deletion of exon 3 leads to a frameshift, producing a small truncated peptide. The following primers were used to detect wild type Ei24 and Ei24flox alleles: 5′-TAAAGTTCTTAGGACACCTCCTG-3′ (F) and 5′-AATGGAGAACTTTAGAATCTCC-3′ (R). The expected sizes are 273 bp and 377 bp, respectively. To generate neural- or liver-specific Ei24-deficient mice, Ei24flox/flox mice were crossed with nestin-Cre or albumin-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory), respectively. Ei24+/− mice were obtained from Ei24flox/wt; Zp3-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory). All mice were raised under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility at the National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing. All animal experiments were approved by the institutional committee of the National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-p62 (PM045, MBL), mouse anti-p62 (ab56416, Abcam), mouse anti-ubiquitin (3936, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-GFAP (bs-0199R, Bioss), rabbit anti-LC3 (PM046, MBL) for Western, rabbit anti-LC3 (2775, Cell Signaling) for staining, mouse anti-NeuN (MAB377, Millipore), mouse anti-β tubulin III (ab7751, Abcam), mouse anti-calbindin (C9848, Sigma), mouse anti-CNPase (2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase) (ab6319, Abcam), rabbit anti-MBP (myelin basic protein) (ab40390, Abcam), and rabbit anti-GFP (ab290, Abcam). An accelerating rotarod (YLS-4C, Beijing Zhongshidichuang Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd) was used to measure motor coordination. After 2 consecutive days training, mice were put on the rolling rod with auto-acceleration ranging from 5–20 rpm within 60 s. The time when the mice fell from the rod was recorded, with a maximum observation time of 2 min. Mice were perfused with 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma). Tissues were post-fixed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination or 0.1% cresyl violet for Nissl staining and examined by light microscopy (Imager A1, Zeiss). For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized in xylene three times, then rehydrated in an ethanol series (100% × 3, 95%, and 75%). After heat-activated antigen retrieval (0.1 m citrate buffer), sections were blocked with normal goat serum. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight in a humidity chamber, washed in PBS three times, and incubated with fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies in a humidified chamber for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, sections were counterstained with DAPI, mounted and examined under an epifluorescence microscope or a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta plus Zeiss Axiovert zoom). Fluorescence intensity and dot numbers were analyzed by Image J software. To score the number of spinal cord motor neurons, fixed spinal cords were sequentially sectioned at 5 μm. Every 6th section was stained with 0.1% cresyl violet. Neurons with a distinct nucleus and a diameter of at least 25 μm located in the anterior horn ventral to the line tangential to the ventral tip of the central canal were counted as motor neurons. To examine cortical neurons, large pyramidal cells located in the fifth layer of the motor and sensory cortices were quantified. The number of Purkinje cells in lobules III, IV, and V were quantified and divided by the total length of the lobules. The thickness of the molecular layer was calculated by dividing the distance between lobules III and IV, or lobules V and VI, by 2. Mouse tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). After incubation on ice for 30 min, homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay (Genstar). For preparation of detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions, mouse tissues were homogenized in five volumes of sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitors (Roche). After centrifuging at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 4 μg/μl. An aliquot of 100-μl supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of sucrose buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to separate supernatants (detergent-soluble fraction) and pellets. Pellets were dissolved in 200 μl of 1% SDS in PBS (detergent-insoluble fraction). Equal amounts (30∼40 μg) of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, washed with PBST three times and incubated with HRP-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was detected using an Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) kit (Pierce). RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and cDNA was synthesized by Super Script® III First-Strand Kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler® ep Realplex 4 using SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM (TaKaRa). The following primers were used: 5′-ACTTCCCTCTCGCTGTATTTGAT-3′ (F-Ei24) and 5′-TTGCTTCCGCTCTACACTCTG-3′ (R-Ei24); 5′-GCTGCCCTATACCCACATCT-3′ (F-p62) and 5′-CGCCTTCATCCGAGAAAC-3′ (R-p62); 5′-CTACCTTGCCCGAAAGCAC-3′ (F-Gstm1) and 5′-ATGTCTGCACGGATCCTCTC-3′ (R-Gstm1); 5′-ACCAAGGACACCAAGTTTCG-3′ (F-Cyp2a5) and 5′-AGAGCCCAGCATAGGAAACA-3′ (R-Cyp2a5); 5′-AGCGTTCGGTATTACGATCC-3′ (F-Nqo1) and 5′-AGTACAATCAGGGCTCTTCTCG-3′ (R-Nqo1); 5′-CTGGCTCCTAGCACCATGAAGAT-3′ (F-actin) and 5′-GGTGGACAGTGAGGCCAGGAT-3′ (R-actin). Proteasome activity was determined using aminomethylcoumarin (AMC)-linked synthetic peptide substrates: Ac-Gly-Pro-Leu-Asp-AMC, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC and Ac-Arg-Leu-Arg-AMC (and Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC) for caspase-like, chymotrypsin-like, or trypsin-like activity, respectively (Proteasome Substrate Pack, Enzo Life Sciences). Mice tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm ATP). 250 μl of lysate containing equal amounts of protein (2–4 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark with 2.5 μl of each substrate (final concentration: 50 nm). The reaction was stopped by adding 252.5 μl pre-cooled 96% ethanol solution. Proteasome activity was measured by detecting fluorescence from AMC hydrolysis (380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission). Mice were transcardially perfused with 2% PFA/2% glutaraldehyde buffered with 0.1 m pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (PB). Tissues were separated, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in PB buffer for 2 h, dehydrated with graded ethanol solutions, and embedded in Embed812. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 min and lead citrate for 10 min and examined using transmission electron microscopy (TecnaiTM Spirit, FEI). Data from at least three sets of samples were used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was calculated by Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. We generated Ei24 conditional knock-out mice by flanking exon 3 of Ei24 with two loxP sequences (Fig. 1A). When we crossed Ei24+/− adults (obtained from Ei24flox/wt; Zp3-Cre mice), no Ei24−/− offspring survived to the neonatal stage, suggesting an essential role of Ei24 during embryogenesis. The function of Ei24 was therefore investigated by crossing Ei24flox/flox mice with mice expressing tissue-specific Cre recombinase. Ei24flox/flox mice were crossed with nestin-Cre mice to produce animals deficient for Ei24 in the central nervous system (referred to as Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre) from embryonic stages (Fig. 1B). Nestin is highly expressed in neuroepithelial precursors, which give rise to neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (21.Lendahl U. Zimmerman L.B. McKay R.D. CNS stem cells express a new class of intermediate filament protein.Cell. 1990; 60: 585-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice appeared normal at birth, but started to show growth retardation at 2 weeks of age and had ∼50% reduction in body weight compared with Ei24flox/+; nestin-Cre littermates (referred to as control littermates in this study) by 3 months (Fig. 1C). The survival rate was also dramatically reduced; 50% of mutant mice died by ∼16 weeks after birth and all mice died by 19 weeks independent of sex (Fig. 1D). Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice exhibited motor and behavioral deficits at 6 weeks of age and became progressively worse. 8 out of 12 mutant mice at 6 weeks of age and 12 out of 12 of mutant mice at 8 weeks of age exhibited abnormal limb-clasping reflexes (Fig. 1E). All 3-month-old mutants showed poor motor coordination in a rotarod test (Fig. 1F). Mutant mice exhibited marked tremor at 8 weeks and ataxic gait at 12 weeks. At 14 weeks, the hindlimbs of resting mutant mice were flexed, like control littermates, but became hyperextended posteriorly during movement (Fig. 1G; supplemental movie). Thus, neural-specific Ei24 deficiency causes behavioral and motor defects. To investigate the neural defect in Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice, histological analyses were performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Nissl staining of sections from cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord of control and mutant mice at 4 months of age. Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre brains had enlarged lateral ventricles (Fig. 2A). Mutant mice showed atrophy of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 2A); the ratio of cortical to dorsoventral thickness in Ei24flox/+; nestin-Cre and Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice was 0.18 ± 0.02 and 0.13 ± 0.01, respectively (p < 0.05). The white matter between the cortex and hippocampal pyramidal cells was thinner in mutants (Fig. 2A). The number of neurons in cortical layers 1–4 was greatly reduced compared with controls, as was the number of pyramidal neurons in the 5th layer of the motor and sensory cortices (Fig. 2B; supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). The hippocampal pyramidal cell layer was much thinner with reduced neuron numbers (Fig. 2C). H&E and axon-specific β-tubulin III staining revealed irregularly arranged nerve fibers in the alveus of the hippocampus (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). Eosinophilic spheroids, representing axon swellings (10.Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N. Suppression of basal autophagy in neural cells causes neurodegenerative disease in mice.Nature. 2006; 441: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar), were observed in the cortex (supplemental Fig. S1F). Vacuolated cells were observed in the cingulate cortex and to a lesser extent in other cortices, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus (Fig. 2D). Numerous vacuolated cells were found in white matter regions including the corpus callosum, the alveus of the hippocampus and the internal capsule (Fig. 2D, supplemental Fig. S1D, data not shown). The vacuolated cells were stained by the oligodendroglial marker anti-2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) (Fig. 2E). Oligodendrocytes support axonal integrity and myelinate the axons of the CNS (22.Emery B. Regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.Science. 2010; 330: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Staining with anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) (which labels myelin) or anti-CNPase (which labels cell bodies and myelin) revealed fragmented myelin structures in various cerebral regions in mutant mice (Fig. 2F; supplemental Fig. S1G). The cerebella of Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice were less foliated and fissured than controls (Fig. 2G). The molecular cell layer was thinner (Fig. 2H). Purkinje cell numbers were reduced by 40% and the remaining cells appeared shrunken (Fig. 2I). The deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), to which Purkinje cells project axons, contained numerous large eosinophilic spheroid structures (supplemental Fig. S1H), indicative of axonal swellings (10.Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N. Suppression of basal autophagy in neural cells causes neurodegenerative disease in mice.Nature. 2006; 441: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). We further stained the DCN region with anti-calbindin, which specifically labels Purkinje axons, and found accumulation of huge bulging calbindin-positive structures in the DCN region of Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice, indicating abnormal swelling and dystrophy of Purkinje cell axon terminals (Fig. 2J). MBP staining showed that some of the dilated calbindin-positive termini were enwrapped by myelin, confirming the degeneration of Purkinje cell axons (Fig. 2J; supplemental Fig. S1, I–J). Ultrastructurally, axon numbers in the DCN region were dramatically reduced and the remaining axons showed thinned, split myelin sheaths and various signs of degeneration (Fig. 2, K–M; supplemental Fig. S1, K–N). In the anterior horn of the lumbar spinal cord, interneuron numbers were dramatically reduced in Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice but the number of large motor neurons was not significantly different (Fig. 2N; supplemental Fig. S1, O and P). Numerous vacuolated oligodendrocytes accumulated in spinal cord gray and white matter (Fig. 2O; supplemental Fig. S1Q). Expression of the glial marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) dramatically increased in the cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord of mutant mice (Fig. 2P), indicating that neurodegeneration was accompanied by reactive astrogliosis. To investigate whether the neural abnormalities in Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice increase progressively, brain and spinal cord sections from Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice and controls at 3 weeks, one month, two months, and four months were analyzed. The number of pyramidal neurons in the 5th layer of the cortex in Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice at 3 weeks of age was comparable to control littermates, but gradually decreased as the mice grew older (Fig. 3A). The number of Purkinje cells and thickness of the molecular layer progressively decreased (Fig. 3, B and C). Vacuolated oligodendrocytes in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord were small in size and few in number in mutant mice at 3 weeks and one month of age but became larger and more numerous at 2 and 4 months of age (Fig. 3A; supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). The mutant mice also showed progressively more irregularly arranged nerve fibers in the alveus of the hippocampus, more severe axonal swelling in the DCN of the cerebellum and deterioration of axonal myelin sheaths in various regions of the brain and spinal cord (Fig. 3, D and E; supplemental Fig. 2C). Thus, neural-specific Ei24 deficiency results in progressive axonal degeneration and neuronal loss. We next investigated autophagic flux in mutant mice by examining levels and distribution of LC3. Brain and spinal cord extracts from Ei24flox/flox; nestin-Cre mice at 4 months showed accumulation of LC3-II, a lipidated form of LC3 that normally associates with autophagosomal membranes (Fig. 4A). Immunostaining with anti-LC3 revealed that LC3 diffusely accumulated in various regions of the brain and spinal cord of Ei24flox/f"
https://openalex.org/W1996159713,"Conservation investment, particularly for charismatic and wide-ranging large mammal species, needs to be evidence-based. Despite the prevalence of this theme within the literature, examples of robust data being generated to guide conservation policy and funding decisions are rare. We present the first published case-study of tiger conservation in Indochina, from a site where an evidence-based approach has been implemented for this iconic predator and its prey. Despite the persistence of extensive areas of habitat, Indochina's tiger and ungulate prey populations are widely supposed to have precipitously declined in recent decades. The Seima Protection Forest (SPF), and broader Eastern Plains Landscape, was identified in 2000 as representing Cambodia's best hope for tiger recovery; reflected in its designation as a Global Priority Tiger Conservation Landscape. Since 2005 distance sampling, camera-trapping and detection-dog surveys have been employed to assess the recovery potential of ungulate and tiger populations in SPF. Our results show that while conservation efforts have ensured that small but regionally significant populations of larger ungulates persist, and density trends in smaller ungulates are stable, overall ungulate populations remain well below theoretical carrying capacity. Extensive field surveys failed to yield any evidence of tiger, and we contend that there is no longer a resident population within the SPF. This local extirpation is believed to be primarily attributable to two decades of intensive hunting; but importantly, prey densities are also currently below the level necessary to support a viable tiger population. Based on these results and similar findings from neighbouring sites, Eastern Cambodia does not currently constitute a Tiger Source Site nor meet the criteria of a Global Priority Tiger Landscape. However, SPF retains global importance for many other elements of biodiversity. It retains high regional importance for ungulate populations and potentially in the future for Indochinese tigers, given adequate prey and protection."
https://openalex.org/W1972458361,"ERK1/2 signaling is frequently dysregulated in tumors through BRAF mutation. Targeting mutant BRAF with vemurafenib frequently elicits therapeutic responses; however, durable effects are often limited by ERK1/2 pathway reactivation via poorly defined mechanisms. We generated mutant BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells that exhibit resistance to PLX4720, the tool compound for vemurafenib, that co-expressed mutant (Q61K) NRAS. In these BRAF(V600E)/NRAS(Q61K) co-expressing cells, re-activation of the ERK1/2 pathway during PLX4720 treatment was dependent on NRAS. Expression of mutant NRAS in parental BRAF(V600) cells was sufficient to by-pass PLX4720 effects on ERK1/2 signaling, entry into S phase and susceptibility to apoptosis in a manner dependent on the RAF binding site in NRAS. ERK1/2 activation in BRAF(V600E)/NRAS(Q61K) cells required CRAF only in the presence of PLX4720, indicating a switch in RAF isoform requirement. Both ERK1/2 activation and resistance to apoptosis of BRAF(V600E)/NRAS(Q61K) cells in the presence of PLX4720 was modulated by SHOC-2/Sur-8 expression, a RAS-RAF scaffold protein. These data show that NRAS mutations confer resistance to RAF inhibitors in mutant BRAF cells and alter RAF isoform and scaffold molecule requirements to re-activate the ERK1/2 pathway."

Both reproducibility and respiratory function correlates of breath fingerprint are poorly known.To measure reproducibility of breath fingerprints and to assess their correlates among respiratory function indexes in elderly healthy and COPD subjects.25 subjects (5 COPD patients for each GOLD stage and 5 healthy controls) over 65 years underwent e-nose study through a seven sensor system and respiratory function tests at times 0, 7, and 15 days. Reproducibility of the e nose pattern was computed. The correlation between volatile organic compound (VOC) pattern and respiratory function/clinical parameters was assessed by the Spearman's rho.VOC patterns were highly reproducible within healthy and GOLD 4 COPD subjects, less among GOLD 1-3 patients.VOC patterns significantly correlated with expiratory flows (Spearman's rho ranging from 0.36 for MEF25% and sensor Co-Buti-TPP, to 0.81 for FEV1% and sensor Cu-Buti-TPP p<0.001)), but not with residual volume and total lung capacity.VOC patterns strictly correlated with expiratory flows. Thus, e nose might conveniently be used to assess COPD severity and, likely, to study phenotypic variability. However, the suboptimal reproducibility within GOLD 1-3 patients should stimulate further research to identify more reproducible breath print patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2073872717,"Bacteria, plants, and algae produce isoprenoids through the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, an attractive pathway for antimicrobial drug development as it is present in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes but absent from human cells. The first committed step of the MEP pathway is catalyzed by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR/MEP synthase). MEP pathway genes have been identified in many biothreat agents, including Francisella, Brucella, Bacillus, Burkholderia, and Yersinia. The importance of the MEP pathway to Francisella is demonstrated by the fact that MEP pathway mutations are lethal. We have previously established that fosmidomycin inhibits purified MEP synthase (DXR) from F. tularensis LVS. FR900098, the acetyl derivative of fosmidomycin, was found to inhibit the activity of purified DXR from F. tularensis LVS (IC(50)=230 nM). Fosmidomycin and FR900098 are effective against purified DXR from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well, but have no effect on whole cells because the compounds are too polar to penetrate the thick cell wall. Fosmidomycin requires the GlpT transporter to enter cells, and this is absent in some pathogens, including M. tuberculosis. In this study, we have identified the GlpT homologs in F. novicida and tested transposon insertion mutants of glpT. We showed that FR900098 also requires GlpT for full activity against F. novicida. Thus, we synthesized several FR900098 prodrugs that have lipophilic groups to facilitate their passage through the bacterial cell wall and bypass the requirement for the GlpT transporter. One compound, that we termed ""compound 1,"" was found to have GlpT-independent antimicrobial activity. We tested the ability of this best performing prodrug to inhibit F. novicida intracellular infection of eukaryotic cell lines and the caterpillar Galleria mellonella as an in vivo infection model. As a lipophilic GlpT-independent DXR inhibitor, compound 1 has the potential to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and should be effective against most MEP-dependent organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2062457273,"Early evaluation of new drug entities for their potential to cause mitochondrial dysfunction is becoming an important task for drug development. Multi-parametric high-content screening (mp-HCS) of mitochondrial toxicity holds promise as a lead in-vitro strategy for drug testing and safety evaluations. In this study, we have developed a mp-HCS and multi-parametric data analysis scheme for assessing cell responses to induced mitochondrial perturbation. The mp-HCS measurements are shown to be robust enough to allow for quantitative comparison of biological systems with different metabolic pathways simulated by alteration of growth media. Substitution of medium glucose for galactose sensitized cells to drug action and revealed novel response parameters. Each compound was quantitatively characterized according to induced phenotypic changes of cell morphology and functionality measured by fluorescent biomarkers for mitochondrial activity, plasma membrane permeability, and nuclear morphology. Descriptors of drug effects were established by generation of a SCRIT (Specialized-Cell-Response-to-Induced-Toxicity) vector, consisting of normalized statistical measures of each parameter at each dose and growth condition. The dimensionality of SCRIT vectors depends on the number of parameters chosen, which in turn depends on the hypothesis being tested. Specifically, incorporation of three parameters of response into SCRIT vectors enabled clustering of 84 training compounds with known pharmacological and toxicological activities according to the degree of toxicity and mitochondrial involvement. Inclusion of 6 parameters enabled the resolution of more subtle differences between compounds within a common therapeutic class; scoring enabled a ranking of statins in direct agreement with clinical outcomes. Comparison of drug-induced changes required variations in glucose for separation of mitochondrial dysfunction from other types of cytotoxicity. These results also demonstrate that the number of drugs in a training set, the choice of parameters used in analysis, and statistical measures are fundamental for specific hypothesis testing and assessment of quantitative phenotypic differences."
https://openalex.org/W2071229967,"cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) are two ubiquitous transcription factors involved in a wide number of cellular processes, including the circadian system. Many previous studies on these factors use cellular assays that provide limited information on circadian activity or anatomical specificity. The ability to study transcription factors in defined tissue within intact animals will help to bridge the gap between cellular and in vivo data. We have used the GAL4-UAS and FLP-FRT systems to gain spatial control over reporter gene expression. Using a luciferase-based reporter, we show in vivo that Drosophila dCREB2- and NF-κB-mediated transcription oscillates in neuronal cells, glia, and in the mushroom body, a higher-order brain center in flies. This oscillation is under circadian control, cycling with a 24-hour rhythm, under both light-dark and dark-dark conditions. In light-light conditions, dCREB2 and NF-κB reporter flies exhibit a suppression of rhythmic activity. Furthermore, neuronal cycling of dCREB2 and NF-κB activity are modulated in period mutant flies, indicating these oscillations are controlled through the central clock. This study shows for the first time region-specific circadian oscillation of dCREB2/NF-κB activity in the Drosophila nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2139795634,"S100A6 is a small EF-hand calcium- and zinc-binding protein involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is overexpressed in neurodegenerative disorders and a proposed marker for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Following recent reports of amyloid formation by S100 proteins, we investigated the aggregation properties of S100A6. Computational analysis using aggregation predictors Waltz and Zyggregator revealed increased propensity within S100A6 helices H(I) and H(IV). Subsequent analysis of Thioflavin-T binding kinetics under acidic conditions elicited a very fast process with no lag phase and extensive formation of aggregates and stacked fibrils as observed by electron microscopy. Ca(2+) exerted an inhibitory effect on the aggregation kinetics, which could be reverted upon chelation. An FT-IR investigation of the early conformational changes occurring under these conditions showed that Ca(2+) promotes anti-parallel β-sheet conformations that repress fibrillation. At pH 7, Ca(2+) rendered the fibril formation kinetics slower: time-resolved imaging showed that fibril formation is highly suppressed, with aggregates forming instead. In the absence of metals an extensive network of fibrils is formed. S100A6 oligomers, but not fibrils, were found to be cytotoxic, decreasing cell viability by up to 40%. This effect was not observed when the aggregates were formed in the presence of Ca(2+). Interestingly, native S1006 seeds SOD1 aggregation, shortening its nucleation process.

https://openalex.org/W2076056682,"Stac3 was identified as a nutritionally regulated gene from an Atlantic salmon subtractive hybridization library with highest expression in skeletal muscle. Salmon Stac3 mRNA was highly correlated with myogenin and myoD1a expression during differentiation of a salmon primary myogenic culture and was regulated by amino acid availability. In zebrafish embryos, stac3 was initially expressed in myotomal adaxial cells and in fast muscle fibers post-segmentation. Morpholino knockdown resulted in defects in myofibrillar protein assembly, particularly in slow muscle fibers, and decreased levels of the hedgehog receptor patched. The function of Stac3 was further characterized in vitro using the mammalian C2C12 myogenic cell line. Stac3 mRNA expression increased during the differentiation of the C2C12 myogenic cell line. Knockdown of Stac3 by RNAi inhibited myotube formation, and microarray analysis revealed that transcripts involved in cell cycle, focal adhesion, cytoskeleton, and the pro-myogenic factors Igfbp-5 and Igf2 were down-regulated. RNAi-treated cells had suppressed Akt signaling and exogenous insulin-like growth factor (Igf) 2 was unable to rescue the phenotype, however, Igf/Akt signaling was not blocked. Overexpression of Stac3, which results in increased levels of Igfbp-5 mRNA, did not lead to increased differentiation. In synchronized cells, Stac3 mRNA was most abundant during the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. RNAi-treated cells were smaller, had higher proliferation rates and a decreased proportion of cells in G(1) phase when compared with controls, suggesting a role in the G(1) phase checkpoint. These results identify Stac3 as a new gene required for myogenic differentiation and myofibrillar protein assembly in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2044174933,"To describe patient antiretroviral therapy (cART) outcomes associated with intensive decentralization of services in a rural HIV program in Malawi.Longitudinal analysis of data from HIV-infected patients starting cART between August 2001 and December 2008 and of a cross-sectional immunovirological assessment conducted 12 (±2) months after therapy start. One-year mortality, lost to follow-up, and attrition (deaths and lost to follow-up) rates were estimated with exact Poisson 95% confidence intervals (CI) by type of care delivery and year of initiation. Association of virological suppression (<50 copies/mL) and immunological success (CD4 gain ≥100 cells/µL), with type of care was investigated using multiple logistic regression.During the study period, 4322 cART patients received centralized care and 11,090 decentralized care. At therapy start, patients treated in decentralized health facilities had higher median CD4 count levels (167 vs. 130 cell/µL, P<0.0001) than other patients. Two years after cART start, program attrition was lower in decentralized than centralized facilities (9.9 per 100 person-years, 95% CI: 9.5-10.4 vs. 20.8 per 100 person-years, 95% CI: 19.7-22.0). One year after treatment start, differences in immunological success (adjusted OR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.83-1.83), and viral suppression (adjusted OR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.56-1.14) between patients followed at centralized and decentralized facilities were not statistically significant.In rural Malawi, 1- and 2-year program attrition was lower in decentralized than in centralized health facilities and no statistically significant differences in one-year immunovirological outcomes were observed between the two health care levels. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm these results."
https://openalex.org/W2060680267,"At the same time that molecular researchers are improving techniques to extract DNA from museum specimens, this increased demand for access to museum specimens has created tension between the need to preserve specimens for maintaining collections and morphological research and the desire to conduct molecular analyses. To address these concerns, we examined the suitability of non-invasive DNA extraction techniques on three species of parasitic Hymenoptera (Braconidae), and test the effects of body size (parasitoid species), age (time since collection), and DNA concentration from each extract on the probability of amplifying meaningful fragments of two commonly used genetic loci. We found that age was a significant factor for determining the probability of success for sequencing both 28S and COI fragments. While the size of the braconid parasitoids significantly affected the total amount of extracted DNA, neither size nor DNA concentration were significant factors for the amplification of either gene region. We also tested several primer combinations of various lengths, but were unable to amplify fragments longer than ∼150 base pairs. These short fragments of 28S and COI were however sufficient for species identification, and for the discovery of within species genetic variation."

Here, we characterize a large panel of Vpx mutants to determine the relationship existing between the functionality of Vpx proteins during primate lentiviral infection of primary myeloid cells and their ability to induce SAMHD1 degradation. Using the same collection of mutants, we explore the intracellular localization at which the interaction between these two proteins may occur. Our results define a number of mutations spread over the 3-helix bundle structure predicted for Vpx that impair both Vpx functionality and its ability to deplete SAMHD1 in target DCs. Certain specific mutations alter the stability of Vpx and its ability to undergo Vpx:Vpx interactions. However, no strict correlation exists between these parameters and Vpx functionality, indicating that they are not limiting factors during the early phases of infection. We define here that SAMHD1 is a non-shuttling nuclear protein that therefore accumulates in the nucleus and is unable to leave it. If WT Vpx partially colocalize with SAMHD1 in the nucleus, we identify a specific functional Vpx mutant that displays an exquisite cytoplasmic distribution and that is able to induce the partial retention of SAMHD1 in the cell cytoplasm. In light of our findings that SAMHD1 does not leave the nucleus, we believe that this mutant retains SAMHD1 in the cytoplasm before this protein enters the nucleus, probably after its translation. Overall, these results point out to an efficient and plastic manner in which Vpx counters SAMHD1. 293T, HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Eagle Modified Medium (DMEM) plus 10% of fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin. Primary blood human monocytes were purified from the blood of healthy donors obtained at the blood bank of Lyon (EFS-Lyon), as described before (7.Goujon C. Rivière L. Jarrosson-Wuilleme L.

Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages or immature DCs upon incubation for 4 to 5 days in RPMI1640 complete medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml of GM-CSF alone or in combination with IL-4 (AbCys). Anti-Flag, anti-VSVg, and anti-tubulin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma, anti-SAMHD1 antibody was purchased from AbCam and the anti-CA antibody was provided by the AIDS Reagents and Reference Program of the NIH. A codon optimized and VSVg-epitope tagged version of SAMHD1 was synthesized and purchased by GenScript. Flag-tagged Vpx/Vpr coding plasmids were described before (20.Goujon C. Arfi V. Pertel T. Luban J. Lienard J. Rigal D. Darlix J.L. Cimarelli A. Characterization of simian immunodeficiency virus SIVSM/human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Vpx function in human myeloid cells.J.

Nomenclature: when two identical residues are mutated within the same Vpx mutant only the identity of the first amino acid is specified (ex: K84/85A indicates that two lysines at position 84 and 85 have been mutated to alanine). HIV-1 GFP-coding lentiviral vectors were produced by co-transfection of 293T cells with 3 plasmids coding: the packaging proteins Gag-Pro-Pol and viral non structural proteins, a mini viral genome bearing a CMV-driven eGFP reporter, and the vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope (VSVg) for ample cellular tropism (7.Goujon C.

SIVSM/HIV-2 Vpx proteins promote retroviral escape from a proteasome-dependent restriction pathway present in human dendritic cells.Retrovirology. 2007; 4: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Virions were purified through a 25% sucrose cushion, resuspended and normalized by infectious titers as determined onto HeLa cells or by protein content against standards of known infectivity (exo-RT activity). Non-infectious virion-like particles (VLPs) were similarly produced using the Gag-Pol of SIVMAC, VSVg and the indicated Vpx proteins in the absence of viral genome. Virions were purified as above and normalized by exo-RT. Infections were carried out for 2 h on 105 cells prior to flow cytometry analysis 3 days afterward. DCs were challenged with the indicated virus in a final volume of 100 μl in flat bottom 96-well plates. Two hours postchallenge, cells were directly spun on the plate and the supernatant replaced with fresh media. The result of the infection was assessed by flow cytometry 3 days later. Macrophages were similarly treated except that 24 well plates were used and infections were carried out in a final volume of 400 μl. To obtain sufficient amounts of protein for WB analysis of SAMHD1 degradation, 5 × 105 DCs were challenged with an MOI equivalent of 2 of VLPs-Vpx and cells were analyzed 24 h post challenge. Transfections were carried out with calcium phosphate of HeLa, 293T or murine NIH3T3 cells, as previously described (20.Goujon C. Arfi V. Pertel T. Luban J. Lienard J. Rigal D. Darlix J.L. Cimarelli A. Characterization of simian immunodeficiency virus SIVSM/human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Vpx function in human myeloid cells.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 12335-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on coverslips, then fixed in 4% formalin (Sigma). Free aldehydes were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl-PBS and cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% or 0.5% Triton X-100 (Macrophages/DCs and HeLa/NIH3T3, respectively). After immunostaining, images were acquired using a spectral Leica sp5 or LSM 710 microscopes. Primary antibodies are described above, rhodamine-labeled Phallodin was purchased from Sigma, while the secondary antibodies were purchased from Vector laboratories. For heterokaryons, HeLa and NIH 3T3 were cocultured on coverslips and fused at a ratio of 1:1 using PEG8000 (50%, Sigma) in the presence of cyclohexamide (CHX at 100 μg/ml, Sigma). Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy 2 h afterward. The degree of colocalization between SAMHD1 and Vpx was measured on 20 cells using the Pearson's correlation coefficient (JACoP tool: where a value of 1 indicates perfect colocalization, while a value of 0 indicates random distribution). The fraction of cytoplasmic SAMHD1 was analyzed by quantifying the Manders overlap coefficient (Fuji image software). Transfected HeLa cells were pulsed for 30 min with 30 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys, prior to extensive cell washing. Cells were then chased for different time points, prior to cell lysis and immunoprecipitation, as described (21.Cimarelli A. Sandin S. Höglund S. Luban J. Basic residues in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nucleocapsid promote virion assembly via interaction with RNA.J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3046-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Vpx was immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag coated beads (Sigma). Samples were run on an SDS-PAGE gel, prior to phosphorimager quantification. The ability of the different Vpx mutants to associate to WT Vpx was assessed after co-transfection of 293T cells with a GST-FLAG-WT SIVMAC Vpx construct along with FLAG-Vpx mutants prior to lysis and precipitation with glutathione-coated agarose beads. Precipitates were then loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by WB. To identify residues of Vpx required for SAMHD1 depletion in DCs, we took advantage of a large panel of Vpx mutants that we had previously characterized with respect to their ability to be incorporated into virion particles and to increase the infectivity of HIV-1 vectors in DCs (20.Goujon C. Arfi V. Pertel T. Luban J. Lienard J. Rigal D. Darlix J.L. Cimarelli A.

Virol. 2008; 82: 12335-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Some of these mutations had also been previously characterized for their ability to affect HIV-2 or SIV replication (22.Belshan M. Kimata J.T. Brown C. Cheng X. McCulley A. Larsen A. Thippeshappa R. Hodara V. Giavedoni L. Hirsch V. Ratner L. Vpx is critical for SIVmne infection of pigtail macaques.Retrovirology. 2012; 9: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23.Belshan M. Mahnke L.A. Ratner L.

The different mutations in Vpx span the 3 helix-bundle core predicted for this protein based on its close homology with Vpr (Fig. 1A). Two novel mutants in conserved residues of helix 3 were added to this collection (K77A/L72A and C83R). The various Vpx mutant proteins were incorporated into non-infectious virion-like particles derived from SIVMAC (VLPs) upon co-transfection of 293T cells with an SIVMAC-derived Gag-Pro-Pol construct. VLPs were then harvested, normalized by protein content by exo-RT, examined for their Vpx content by WB (Fig. 1B), and used on DCs to vehicle Vpx during infection. The ability of Vpx-VLPs to mediate an increase in HIV-1 infectivity was assessed by flow cytometry 3 days after infection, while their ability to deplete SAMHD1 in target DCs was assessed by WB. In line with what we had previously reported, all the Vpx mutants were readily incorporated into VLPs upon co-transfection with Gag-Pol expression plasmids, although 3 mutants displayed lower incorporation rates (ΔPro, Y66A/69A/71A, and W49A/53A/56A, Fig. 1B). Then, exo-RT normalized Vpx-VLPs were provided in trans during the infection of DCs with a constant amount of GFP-coding HIV-1 LVs and their effect on infectivity measured by flow cytometry 3 days afterward (Fig. 1C). As we and others have previously reported (20.Goujon C. Arfi V. Pertel T. Luban J. Lienard J. Rigal D. Darlix J.L. Cimarelli A. Characterization of simian immunodeficiency virus SIVSM/human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Vpx function in human myeloid cells.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 12335-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a number of mutations in Vpx affect its ability to relieve the restrictive phenotype of DCs to incoming HIV-1 particles (S13A/T17A/28A, K68/77A, Y66A/69A/71A, W49A/53A/56A, and Q76A). Of the novel mutants tested here, one was functional, while the second was not (C83R and K77A/L72A, respectively). Next, the ability of these mutants to degrade endogenous SAMHD1 during the early phases of infection of DCs was assessed by WB (Fig. 1D). All non-functional Vpx mutants were unable to deplete SAMHD1 in DCs (S13A/T17A/28A, K77A/L72A, K68/77A, Y66A/69A/71A, and the W49A/53A/56A, while Q76A only modestly and non-reproductively affected SAMHD1 levels). On the contrary, all functional mutants did degrade SAMHD1 in DCs. In the case of the Y66A/69A/71A and W49A/53A/56A Vpx mutants, the impairment in inducing SAMHD1 depletion cannot be ascribed to their lower incorporation into VLPs, because the ΔPro Vpx mutant is incorporated to similar levels, yet it is able to induce SAMHD1 degradation. The intracellular localization of SAMHD1 during infection remains unclear, as published data support either a nuclear or a cytoplasmic relocalization (24.Hofmann H. Logue E.C. Bloch N. Daddacha W. Polsky S.B. Schultz M.L. Kim B. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2012; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Laguette N. Rahm N. Sobhian B. Chable-Bessia C. Münch J. Snoeck J. Sauter D. Switzer W.M. Heneine W.

Role of SAMHD1 nuclear localization in restriction of HIV-1 and SIVmac.Retrovirology. 2012; 9: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the absence of infection, endogenous SAMHD1 presented an exclusively nuclear staining in both primary macrophages and DCs, and an identical localization was observed upon ectopic expression in HeLa cells and in murine NIH3T3 (Fig. 2A), confirming the described nuclear localization of SAMHD1 under normal conditions. To determine whether SAMHD1 relocalized during infection, primary macrophages, that also display a Vpx-dependent phenotype but that by their tight adherence and spread cytoplasm proved more amenable than DCs for extensive confocal microscopy studies, were challenged with equal amounts of HIV-1 or SIVMAC vectors containing or devoid of Vpx (at a multiplicity of infection, MOI, of 2). Cells were then examined at different time points after infection to determine the presence and the localization of SAMHD1 (Fig. 2B displays representative cells over 400 scored per virus/time point/experiment and for space constraints only results obtained up to 150 min with SIVMAC vectors are presented). Under these conditions, degradation of SAMHD1 occurred rapidly in the presence of Vpx, and the protein virtually disappeared by 12 h postinfection (t50% value ≅ 1.45 h, Fig. 2C). These values are more rapid than those reported previously upon WB analysis, but we believe these differences are solely due to the distinct techniques used (15.Kim B. Nguyen L.A. Daddacha W. Hollenbaugh J.A. Tight interplay among SAMHD1 protein level, cellular dNTP levels, and HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesis kinetics in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 21570-21574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the contrary, SAMHD1 was clearly detected when macrophages where challenged with an SIVMAC virus devoid of Vpx or with HIV-1 (not shown here). Of note, the Vpx protein present in incoming viral particles could not be reliably detected in transduced cells, most likely because of amounts that are below the levels of detection of the assay. At no time point during infection with any of the viruses used here, SAMHD1 was observed outside the nucleus, indicating that this protein does not leave this location during viral infection (Fig. 2B for representative pictures). Overall, these results indicate very rapid kinetics of degradation of SAMHD1, in agreement with the kinetics of the early phases of infection that we and others have measured in myeloid cells (27.Arfi V.

The results presented above strongly suggest that SAMHD1 may be a nuclear non-shuttling protein that is therefore unable to exit the nucleus once this destination is reached. To formally prove it, we assessed whether SAMHD1 possessed the intrinsic ability to shuttle from a donor nucleus (HeLa) to a recipient one (3T3) upon PEG-induced fusion of these two cell types in heterokaryons (according to the scheme of Fig. 3A). Cells were then examined by confocal microscopy and true heterokaryons were identified through phalloidin-mediated actin staining (Fig. 3, B and C, depicting representative pictures of over 80 heterokaryons scored per condition). This technique relies on the clear difference in DAPI pattern between murine and human species nuclei and has been largely used to define the shuttling properties of nuclear proteins (28.Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Major nucleolar proteins shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm.Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 29.Boyd M.T. Vlatkovic N. Rubbi C.P. The nucleolus directly regulates p53 export and degradation.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 194: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As a positive control, the nuclear shuttling Epstein-Barr virus EB2 protein was used (30.Hiriart E. Farjot G. Gruffat H. Nguyen M.V. Sergeant A. Manet E. A novel nuclear export signal and a REF interaction domain both promote mRNA export by the Epstein-Barr virus EB2 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When heterokaryons were thus examined, SAMHD1 was never found in recipient 3T3 nuclei, contrarily to EB2. Since SAMHD1 displays a nuclear staining when ectopically expressed in murine 3T3 (see Fig. 2A), this inability cannot be ascribed to species-specific differences in nuclear entry pathways. Therefore, our results define SAMHD1 as a typical non-shuttling nuclear protein that accumulates in the nucleus, but is unable to leave it. Because SAMHD1 is a nuclear protein and WT Vpx displays a composite intracellular distribution, in both nucleus and cytoplasm (20.Goujon C. Arfi V. Pertel T. Luban J. Lienard J. Rigal D. Darlix J.L. Cimarelli A. Characterization of simian immunodeficiency virus SIVSM/human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Vpx function in human myeloid cells.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 12335-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), WT Vpx is likely to interact with SAMHD1 directly in the nucleus, as proposed (24.Hofmann H. Logue E.C. Bloch N. Daddacha W. Polsky S.B. Schultz M.L. Kim B. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2012; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Brandariz-Nuñez A. Valle-Casuso J.C. White T.E. Laguette N. Benkirane M. Brojatsch J. Diaz-Griffero F. Role of SAMHD1 nuclear localization in restriction of HIV-1 and SIVmac.Retrovirology. 2012; 9: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, we have previously reported that the functional K84A/85A Vpx mutant displays a strict cytoplasmic distribution (20.Goujon C. Arfi V. Pertel T. Luban J. Lienard J. Rigal D. Darlix J.L. Cimarelli A. Characterization of simian immunodeficiency virus SIVSM/human immunodeficiency virus type 2 Vpx function in human myeloid cells.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 12335-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), so that a direct interaction between these two proteins in the nucleus is unlikely. To determine whether this mutant affected the localization of SAMHD1, both proteins were ectopically expressed in HeLa cells then examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). While WT Vpx displayed a diffused staining that co-localized with SAMHD1 in the nucleus, the K84A/K85A Vpx mutant induced the accumulation of, and partially co-localized with, SAMHD1 in a clear punctate pattern in the cell cytoplasm. SAMHD1 and Vpx displayed elevated colocalization in the cytoplasm (Pearson coefficient of 0.96) and involved up to 5.2% ± 1.3% of the total SAMHD1 signal. Given that SAMHD1 does not leave the nucleus once it reaches it, and that the K84A/85A Vpx mutant resides in the cytoplasm, these results indicate that the K84A/85A Vpx mutant likely intercepts a fraction of SAMHD1, before it enters the nucleus. To determine whether functional differences existed between nuclear and cytoplasmic interactions, we determined whether the KK84/85A Vpx mutant exhibited kinetic differences in the degradation of SAMHD1 by comparing it to WT Vpx. To this end, primary macrophages were challenged as above with SIVMAC-derived VLPs incorporating either WT or mutated Vpx and the percentage of SAMHD1+ cells was scored over time (Fig. 5A, for a cumulative analysis, and B for representative cells over more than 400 scored per virus/condition/experiment). Under these conditions, no differences were observed in the kinetics of SAMHD1 degradation between WT and KK84/85A Vpx mutant, indicating that both were able to induce the rapid and efficient degradation of SAMHD1. The addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 during infection prevented SAMHD1 degradation in both cases, indicating that both Vpx proteins depleted SAMHD1 in a proteasome-dependent manner.

Design Observational study of the number of viable bacteria on existing door handles of different design at defined entry/exit points with simultaneous data collection of who used these doors and how often. Setting Two busy specialised intensive care units and one high dependency unit in a tertiary referral NHS neurological hospital. Main outcome measures Surface bacterial density on door handles with reference to design, location, and intensity of use. Results We found a significant correlation between the frequency of movements through a door and the degree to which it was contaminated (p = <0.01). We further found that the door's location, design and mode of use all influenced contamination. When compared to push plate designs, pull handles revealed on average a five fold higher level of contamination; lever handles, however, displayed the highest levels of bacterial contamination when adjusted for frequency of use. We also observed differences in contamination levels at doors between clinical areas, particularly between the operating theatres and one of the ICUs. Conclusions Door handles in busy, “real life” high acuity clinical environments were variably contaminated with bacteria, and the number of bacteria found related to design, location, mode and frequency of operation. Largely ignored issues of handle and environmental design can support or undermine strategies designed to limit avoidable pathogen transmission, especially in locations designed to define “thresholds” and impose physical barriers to pathogen transmission between clinical areas. Developing a multidisciplinary approach beyond traditional boundaries for purposes of infection control may release hitherto unappreciated options and beneficial outcomes for the control of at least some hospital acquired infections."
https://openalex.org/W2055396417,"Phage display system is a powerful tool to design specific ligands for target molecules. Here, we used disulfide-constrained random peptide libraries constructed with the T7 phage display system to isolate peptides specific to human IgA. The binding clones (A1-A4) isolated by biopanning exhibited clear specificity to human IgA, but the synthetic peptide derived from the A2 clone exhibited a low specificity/affinity (K(d) = 1.3 μm). Therefore, we tried to improve the peptide using a partial randomized phage display library and mutational studies on the synthetic peptides. The designed Opt-1 peptide exhibited a 39-fold higher affinity (K(d) = 33 nm) than the A2 peptide. An Opt-1 peptide-conjugated column was used to purify IgA from human plasma. However, the recovered IgA fraction was contaminated with other proteins, indicating nonspecific binding. To design a peptide with increased binding specificity, we examined the structural features of Opt-1 and the Opt-1-IgA complex using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water. The simulation results revealed that the Opt-1 peptide displayed partial helicity in the N-terminal region and possessed a hydrophobic cluster that played a significant role in tight binding with IgA-Fc. However, these hydrophobic residues of Opt-1 may contribute to nonspecific binding with other proteins. To increase binding specificity, we introduced several mutations in the hydrophobic residues of Opt-1. The resultant Opt-3 peptide exhibited high specificity and high binding affinity for IgA, leading to successful isolation of IgA without contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2168288630,"High dose ionizing radiation (IR) is a well-known risk factor for breast cancer but the health effects after low-dose (LD, <10 cGy) exposures remain highly uncertain. We explored a systems approach that compared LD-induced chromosome damage and transcriptional responses in strains of mice with genetic differences in their sensitivity to radiation-induced mammary cancer (BALB/c and C57BL/6) for the purpose of identifying mechanisms of mammary cancer susceptibility. Unirradiated mammary and blood tissues of these strains differed significantly in baseline expressions of DNA repair, tumor suppressor, and stress response genes. LD exposures of 7.5 cGy (weekly for 4 weeks) did not induce detectable genomic instability in either strain. However, the mammary glands of the sensitive strain but not the resistant strain showed early transcriptional responses involving: (a) diminished immune response, (b) increased cellular stress, (c) altered TGFβ-signaling, and (d) inappropriate expression of developmental genes. One month after LD exposure, the two strains showed opposing responses in transcriptional signatures linked to proliferation, senescence, and microenvironment functions. We also discovered a pre-exposure expression signature in both blood and mammary tissues that is predictive for poor survival among human cancer patients (p = 0.0001), and a post-LD-exposure signature also predictive for poor patient survival (p<0.0001). There is concordant direction of expression in the LD-exposed sensitive mouse strain, in biomarkers of human DCIS and in biomarkers of human breast tumors. Our findings support the hypothesis that genetic mechanisms that determine susceptibility to LD radiation induced mammary cancer in mice are similar to the tissue mechanisms that determine poor-survival in breast cancer patients. We observed non-linearity of the LD responses providing molecular evidence against the LNT risk model and obtained new evidence that LD responses are strongly influenced by genotype. Our findings suggest that the biological assumptions concerning the mechanisms by which LD radiation is translated into breast cancer risk should be reexamined and suggest a new strategy to identify genetic features that predispose or protect individuals from LD-induced breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2043007061,"Pluripotent stem cells are uniquely capable of differentiating into somatic cell derivatives of all three germ lineages, therefore holding tremendous promise for developmental biology studies and regenerative medicine therapies. Although temporal patterns of phenotypic gene expression have been relatively well characterized during the course of differentiation, coincident patterns of endogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factor expression that accompany pluripotent stem cell differentiation remain much less well-defined. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the global dynamic profiles of ECM and growth factor genes associated with early stages of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Gene expression analysis of ECM and growth factors by ESCs differentiating as embryoid bodies for up to 14 days was assessed using PCR arrays (172 unique genes total), and the results were examined using a variety of data mining methods. As expected, decreases in the expression of genes regulating pluripotent stem cell fate preceded subsequent increases in morphogen expression associated with differentiation. Pathway analysis generated solely from ECM and growth factor gene expression highlighted morphogenic cell processes within the embryoid bodies, such as cell growth, migration, and intercellular signaling, that are required for primitive tissue and organ developmental events. In addition, systems analysis of ECM and growth factor gene expression alone identified intracellular molecules and signaling pathways involved in the progression of pluripotent stem cell differentiation that were not contained within the array data set. Overall, these studies represent a novel framework to dissect the complex, dynamic nature of the extracellular biochemical milieu of stem cell microenvironments that regulate pluripotent cell fate decisions and morphogenesis."

It has been previously suggested that the cytotoxicity of thiopurine drugs involves their metabolic activation, the resultant generation of 6-thioguanine (SG) and S6-methylthioguanine (S6mG) in DNA, and the futile mismatch repair triggered by replication-induced SG:T and S6mG:T mispairs. Disruption of transcription is known to be one of the major consequences of DNA damage induced by many antiviral and antitumor agents; however, it remains undefined how SG and S6mG compromise the efficiency and fidelity of transcription. Using our recently developed competitive transcription and adduct bypass assay, herein we examined the impact of SG and S6mG on transcription in vitro and in human cells. Our results revealed that, when situated on the transcribed strand, S6mG exhibited both inhibitory and mutagenic effects during transcription mediated by single-subunit T7 RNA polymerase or multisubunit human RNA polymerase II in vitro and in human cells. Moreover, we found that the impact of S6mG on transcriptional efficiency and fidelity is modulated by the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair capacity. In contrast, SG did not considerably compromise the efficiency or fidelity of transcription, and it was a poor substrate for NER.

Assays for transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II using oligo(dC)-tailed template with single DNA damage.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that SG in DNA is only marginally inhibitory to transcription in vitro (10.Brem R. Li F. Karran P. Reactive oxygen species generated by thiopurine/UVA cause irreparable transcription-blocking DNA lesions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, it remains undefined whether SG compromises transcription fidelity and how S6mG affects DNA transcription. To address these questions, here we have examined quantitatively the impact of SG and S6mG on the transcriptional efficiency and accuracy in vitro and in vivo by using our recently developed competitive transcription and adduct bypass assay (35.You C. Dai X. Yuan B. Wang J. Brooks P.J. Niedernhofer L.J. Wang Y. A quantitative assay for assessing the effects of DNA lesions on transcription.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also investigated whether TC-NER is involved in the removal of these lesions in human cells. Unmodified oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs), [γ-32P]ATP, and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, PerkinElmer Life Technologies, and USB Corporation, respectively. Chemicals and enzymes unless otherwise specified were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and New England Biolabs, respectively. The 293T human embryonic kidney epithelial cells were purchased from ATCC. The human skin fibroblast cell lines GM00637 and GM04429 were kindly provided by Prof. Gerd P. Pfeifer (City of Hope). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (ATCC) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. To construct lesion-free control vector for SG and S6mG, a 52-mer ODN with the sequence of 5′-CTAGCGCTACCGGACTCAGATCTCGAGCTCTAGCTTTGCGCAAGCGACTCCG-3′ was annealed with the complementary strand and ligated to an NheI-EcoRI restriction fragment from the nonreplicating pTGFP-T7-Hha10 plasmids (35.You C.

Biol. 2012; 8: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We next treated the control plasmids with the nicking enzyme Nt.BstNBI and subsequently produced a gapped vector by removing a 33-mer single-stranded ODN. The gapped plasmid was subsequently annealed with a 5′-phosphorylated SG- or S6mG-bearing ODN and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was incubated with ethidium bromide, and the resulting supercoiled lesion-bearing plasmid was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, following recently published procedures (21.Yuan B.

Purified control or lesion-bearing genome was mixed with a competitor genome and used as transcription templates, with a molar ratio of competitor vector to control or lesion-bearing genome being 1:6 for all experiments in this study. Multiple rounds of transcription reactions using T7 RNAP or HeLa nuclear extract (Promega) were performed as described elsewhere (35.You C. Dai X. Yuan B. Wang J. Brooks P.J. Niedernhofer L.J. Wang Y. A quantitative assay for assessing the effects of DNA lesions on transcription.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, T7 RNAP-mediated reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a 20-μl mixture containing 20 units of T7 RNAP, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, 0.5 mm each ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, and 50 ng of NotI-linearized DNA template. The hRNAPII-mediated reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in a 25-μl mixture containing 8 units of HeLa nuclear extract, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, 0.4 mm each of all four ribonucleotides, and 50 ng of NotI-linearized DNA template. Human skin fibroblast cells (GM00637 and GM04429) were grown to ∼70% confluence in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 50 ng of mixed genome and 450 ng of carrier plasmid (self-ligated pGEM-T; Promega) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. To prepare the carrier plasmid, we first treated the linearized pGEM-T vector (Promega) containing 3′-T overhangs with T4 DNA polymerase, followed by self-ligating the resultant plasmid DNA, which contains blunt ends. Highly efficient depletion of cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) and xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) genes was achieved by siRNA treatments as previously described (35.You C. Dai X. Yuan B. Wang J. Brooks P.J. Niedernhofer L.J. Wang Y. A quantitative assay for assessing the effects of DNA lesions on transcription.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and all siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon: CSB SMARTpool (L-004888), XPC SMARTpool (L-016040), and siGENOME NonTargeting siRNA (D-001210). Briefly, for siRNA experiments, 293T cells were grown to 40–60% confluence in 24-well plates and transfected with either or both XPC and CSB siRNAs (25 pmol each). After a 48-h incubation, 50 ng of mixed genome, 450 ng of carrier DNA, and another aliquot of siRNAs were co-transfected into the cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For all in vivo transcription assays, the cells were harvested for RNA extraction 24 h after transfection with the mixed genome. RNA transcripts arising from in vitro or in vivo transcription were isolated using the Total RNA Kit I (Omega) and subjected to two rounds of DNase I treatment with the DNA-free kit (Ambion) to eliminate the DNA contamination. cDNA was generated by using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and a mixture of an oligo(dT)16 primer and a gene-specific primer (5′-TCGGTGTTGCTGTGAT-3′). RT-PCR amplification for PAGE and LC-MS/MS analyses were then performed by using Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase and a pair of primers spanning the lesion site as described in a recent study (35.You C. Dai X. Yuan B. Wang J. Brooks P.J. Niedernhofer L.J. Wang Y. A quantitative assay for assessing the effects of DNA lesions on transcription.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

Briefly, a portion of the above RT-PCR fragments was incubated in a 10-μl reaction containing 1× NEB buffer 4, 10 units of SacI, and 1 unit of shrimp alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C for 1 h and then at 80 °C for 20 min. The resulting dephosphorylated DNA was incubated in a 15-μl solution containing 1× NEB buffer 4, ATP (50 pmol of cold, premixed with 1.66 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP), and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and at 65 °C for 20 min, after which 10 units of FspI was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting 32P-labeled restriction fragments were resolved by using 30% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide = 19:1) with 8 m urea and quantified by phosphorimaging analysis (21.Yuan B.

To identify the transcription products of SG and S6mG using LC-MS/MS, RT-PCR products were treated with 50 units of SacI, 50 units of FspI, and 20 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase in 250 μl of NEB buffer 4 at 37 °C for 4 h, followed by heating at 80 °C for 20 min. The resulting solution was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v), and the aqueous portion was dried with a SpeedVac, desalted with HPLC, and dissolved in water.

Briefly, a 0.5 × 150-mm Zorbax SB-C18 column (Agilent Technologies) was used. The flow rate was 8.0 μl/min, and a 5-min linear gradient of 5–35% methanol followed by a 15 min of 35–95% methanol in 400 mm 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol buffer (pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of triethylamine) was employed for the separation. The LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer was set up for monitoring the fragmentation of the [M-3H]3− ions of the 14-mer (d(GCAAAMCTAGAGCT), where M designates A, T, C, or G) ODNs. To investigate how SG or S6mG perturbs the efficiency and fidelity of transcription, we first constructed nonreplicating double-stranded plasmids with a single SG or S6mG at a defined site on the transcribed strand (Fig. 1B). The lesions were positioned 63 and 44 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start sites of the cytomegalovirus and T7 promoters, respectively. In this context, we chose T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) as a model for assessing the potential impact of these lesions on transcription of mitochondrial genome,"
https://openalex.org/W2151482644,"Background New viruses pathogenic to plants continue to emerge due to mutation, recombination, or reassortment among genomic segments among individual viruses. Tospoviruses cause significant economic damage to a wide range of crops in many parts of the world. The genetic or molecular basis of the continued emergence of new tospoviruses and new hosts is not well understood though it is generally accepted that reassortment and/or genetic complementation among the three genomic segments of individual viruses could be contributing to this variability since plants infected with more than one tospovirus are not uncommon in nature. Methodology/Principal Findings Two distinct and economically important tospoviruses, Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), were investigated for inter-virus interactions at the molecular level in dually-infected plants. Datura (Datura stramonium) is a permissive host for TSWV, while it restricts the movement of IYSV to inoculated leaves. In plants infected with both viruses, however, TSWV facilitated the selective movement of the viral gene silencing suppressor (NSs) gene of IYSV to the younger, uninoculated leaves. The small RNA expression profiles of IYSV and TSWV in single- and dually-infected datura plants showed that systemic leaves of dually-infected plants had reduced levels of TSWV N gene-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). No TSWV NSs-specific siRNAs were detected either in the inoculated or systemic leaves of dually-infected datura plants indicating a more efficient suppression of host silencing machinery in the presence of NSs from both viruses as compared to the presence of only TSWV NSs. Conclusion/Significance Our study identifies a new role for the viral gene silencing suppressor in potentially modulating the biology and host range of viruses and underscores the importance of virally-coded suppressors of gene silencing in virus infection of plants. This is the first experimental evidence of functional complementation between two distinct tospoviruses in the Bunyaviridae family."
https://openalex.org/W2078826358,"Background Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is one of the major etiologic agents of respiratory tract infections among children worldwide. Methodology/Principal Findings Here through a comprehensive analysis of the two major HRSV groups A and B (n = 1983) which comprise of several genotypes, we present a complex pattern of population dynamics of HRSV over a time period of 50 years (1956–2006). Circulation pattern of HRSV revealed a series of expansions and fluctuations of co-circulating lineages with a predominance of HRSVA. Positively selected amino acid substitutions of the G glycoprotein occurred upon population growth of GB3 with a 60-nucleotide insertion (GB3 Insert), while other genotypes acquired substitutions upon both population growth and decrease, thus possibly reflecting a role for immune selected epitopes in linkage to the traced substitution sites that may have important relevance for vaccine design. Analysis evidenced the co-circulation and predominance of distinct HRSV genotypes in Brazil and suggested a year-round presence of the virus. In Brazil, GA2 and GA5 were the main culprits of HRSV outbreaks until recently, when the GB3 Insert became highly prevalent. Using Bayesian methods, we determined the dispersal patterns of genotypes through several inferred migratory routes. Conclusions/Significance Genotypes spread across continents and between neighboring areas. Crucially, genotypes also remained at any given region for extended periods, independent of seasonal outbreaks possibly maintained by re-infecting the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2069318699,"Plesiomonas shigelloides is one of the causative agents of human gastroenteritis, with increasing number of reports describing such infections in recent years. In this study, the hugA gene was chosen as the target to design loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for the rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of P. shigelloides. The performance of the assay with reference plasmids and spiked human stools as samples was evaluated and compared with those of quantitative PCR (qPCR). No false-positive results were observed for the 32 non-P. shigelloides strains used to evaluate assay specificity. The limit of detection for P. shigelloides was approximately 20 copies per reaction in reference plasmids and 5×103 CFU per gram in spiked human stool, which were more sensitive than the results of qPCR. When applied in human stool samples spiked with 2 low levels of P. shigelloides, the LAMP assays achieved accurate detection after 6-h enrichment. In conclusion, the LAMP assay developed in this study is a valuable method for rapid, cost-effective, and simple detection of P. shigelloides in basic clinical and field laboratories in the rural areas of China."
https://openalex.org/W2101318371,"Inferring the structure of populations has many applications for genetic research. In addition to providing information for evolutionary studies, it can be used to account for the bias induced by population stratification in association studies. To this end, many algorithms have been proposed to cluster individuals into genetically homogeneous sub-populations. The parametric algorithms, such as Structure, are very popular but their underlying complexity and their high computational cost led to the development of faster parametric alternatives such as Admixture. Alternatives to these methods are the non-parametric approaches. Among this category, AWclust has proven efficient but fails to properly identify population structure for complex datasets. We present in this article a new clustering algorithm called Spectral Hierarchical clustering for the Inference of Population Structure (SHIPS), based on a divisive hierarchical clustering strategy, allowing a progressive investigation of population structure. This method takes genetic data as input to cluster individuals into homogeneous sub-populations and with the use of the gap statistic estimates the optimal number of such sub-populations. SHIPS was applied to a set of simulated discrete and admixed datasets and to real SNP datasets, that are data from the HapMap and Pan-Asian SNP consortium. The programs Structure, Admixture, AWclust and PCAclust were also investigated in a comparison study. SHIPS and the parametric approach Structure were the most accurate when applied to simulated datasets both in terms of individual assignments and estimation of the correct number of clusters. The analysis of the results on the real datasets highlighted that the clusterings of SHIPS were the more consistent with the population labels or those produced by the Admixture program. The performances of SHIPS when applied to SNP data, along with its relatively low computational cost and its ease of use make this method a promising solution to infer fine-scale genetic patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2154121857,"The Mediterranean region is one of the hot spots of climate change. This study aims at understanding what are the conditions sustaining tree diversity in Mediterranean wet forests under future scenarios of altered hydrological regimes. The core of the work is a quantitative, dynamic model describing the coexistence of different Mediterranean tree species, typical of arid or semi-arid wetlands. Two kind of species, i.e. Hygrophilous (drought sensitive, flood resistant) and Non-hygrophilous (drought resistant, flood sensitive), are broadly defined according to the distinct adaptive strategies of trees against water stress of summer drought and winter flooding. We argue that at intermediate levels of water supply the dual role of water (resource and stress) results in the coexistence of the two kind of species. A bifurcation analysis allows us to assess the effects of climate change on the coexistence of the two species in order to highlight the impacts of predicted climate scenarios on tree diversity. Specifically, the model has been applied to Mediterranean coastal swamp forests of Central Italy located at Castelporziano Estate and Circeo National Park. Our results show that there are distinct rainfall thresholds beyond which stable coexistence becomes impossible. Regional climatic projections show that the lower rainfall threshold may be approached or crossed during the XXI century, calling for an urgent adaptation and mitigation response to prevent biodiversity losses."
https://openalex.org/W2066278394,"Lysine acetylation is a post-translational modification that is important for the regulation of metabolism in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In bacteria, the best studied protein acetyltransferase is Pat. In the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris, at least 10 AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetase enzymes are acetylated by the Pat homologue RpPat. All bona fide RpPat substrates contain the conserved motif PX(4)GK. Here, we show that the presence of such a motif is necessary but not sufficient for recognition by RpPat. RpPat failed to acetylate the methylmalonyl-CoA synthetase of this bacterium (hereafter RpMatB) in vivo and in vitro, despite the homology of RpMatB to known RpPat substrates. We used RpMatB to identify structural determinants that are recognized by RpPat. To do this, we constructed a series of RpMatB chimeras that became substrates of RpPat. In such chimeras, a short region (11-25 residues) of RpMatB located >20 residues N-terminal to the acetylation site was replaced with the corresponding sequences from other AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases that were known RpPat substrates. Strikingly, the enzymatic activity of RpMatB chimeras was regulated by acetylation both in vitro and in vivo. Crystal structures of two of these chimeras showed that the major difference between them and wild-type RpMatB was within a loop region ∼23 Å from the acetylation site. On the basis of these results, we suggest that RpPat likely interacts with a relatively large surface of its substrates, in addition to the PX(4)GK motif, and that RpPat probably has relatively narrow substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2076017197,"Glutamate receptors mediate the majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, and excessive stimulation of these receptors is involved in a variety of neurological disorders and neuronal damage from stroke. The development of new subtype-specific antagonists would be of considerable therapeutic interest. Natural products can provide important new lead compounds for drug discovery. The only natural product known to inhibit glutamate receptors competitively is (-)-kaitocephalin, which was isolated from the fungus Eupenicillium shearii and found to protect CNS neurons from excitotoxicity. Previous work has shown that it is a potent antagonist of some subtypes of glutamate receptors (AMPA and NMDA, but not kainate). The structure of kaitocephalin bound to the ligand binding domain of the AMPA receptor subtype, GluA2, is reported here. The structure suggests how kaitocephalin can be used as a scaffold to develop more selective and high affinity antagonists for glutamate receptors."

The dose range was from 0 Gy to 5 Gy. Optical computed tomography was used to scan the polymer gel dosimeter. Each component was set to two levels for all four variables, including (A) 4% and 6%, (B) 4% and 6%, (C) 2% and 4%, as well as (D) 5 and 15 mM. Response surface methodology and a central composite design were adopted for the quantitative investigation of the respective interaction effects on the dose response curve of the gel. The results showed that the contributions of the interaction effects, i.e., AB (6.22%), AC (8.38%), AD (7.74%), BC (9.44%), ABC (18.24%), BCD (12.66%), and ABCD (13.4%), were greater than those of the four main effects, accounting for over 76.08% of the total variability. These results also indicated that the NIPAM gel recipe with the highest sensitivity was at 40%C (mass fraction of Bis)."
https://openalex.org/W2103073294,"We previously investigated a sample of patients during an active phase of psychosis in the search for genetic predictors of haloperidol induced side effects. In the present work we extend the genetic association analysis to a wider panel of genetic variations, including 508 variations located in 96 genes. The original sample included 96 patients. An independent group of 357 patients from the CATIE study served as a replication sample. Outcomes in the investigation sample were the variation through time of: 1) the ESRS and UKU total scores 2) ESRS and UKU subscales (neurologic and psychic were included) related to tremors and 3) ESRS and UKU subscales that do not relate to tremors. Outcome in the replication sample was the presence vs absence of motoric side effects from baseline to visit 1 (∼ one month of treatment) as assessed by the AIMS scale test. Rs2242480 located in the CYP3A4 was associated with a different distribution of the UKU neurologic scores through time (permutated p = 0.047) along with a trend for a different haloperidol plasma levels (lower in CC subjects). This finding was not replicated in the CATIE sample. In conclusion, we did not find conclusive evidence for a major association between the investigated variations and haloperidol induced motoric side effects"
https://openalex.org/W1965660128,"Incidence and mortality due to tuberculosis (TB) have been decreasing worldwide. Given that TB is a cosmopolitan disease, proper surveillance and evaluation are critical for controlling dissemination. Herein, mathematical modeling was performed in order to: 1) demonstrate a correlation between the incidence of TB in HIV-free patients in the US and Germany, and their corresponding mortality rates; 2) show the utility of the newly developed D-R algorithm for analyzing and predicting the incidence of TB in both countries; and 3) inform us on population death rates due to TB in HIV-negative patients. Using data published by the World Health Organization between 1990 and 2009, the relationship between incidence and mortality that could not be ascribed to HIV infection was evaluated. Using linear, quadratic and cubic curves, we found that a cubic function provided the best fit with the data in both the US (Y = 2.3588+2.2459X+61.1639X(2)-60.104X(3)) and Germany (Y = 1.9271+9.4967X+18.3824X(2)-10.350X(3)) where the correlation coefficient (R) between incidence and mortality was 0.995 and 0.993, respectively. Second, we demonstrated that fitted curves using the D-R model were equal to or better than those generated using the GM(1,1) algorithm as exemplified in the relative values for Sum of Squares of Error, Relative Standard Error, Mean Absolute Deviation, Average Relative Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Finally, future trends using both the D-R and the classic GM(1,1) models predicted a continued decline in infection and mortality rates of TB in HIV-negative patients rates extending to 2015 assuming no changes to diagnosis or treatment regimens are enacted."
https://openalex.org/W2087547217,"Annexin A1 is a multi functional molecule which is involved in inflammation, innate and adaptive immune systems, tumor progression and metastasis. We have previously showed the impaired tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis and wound healing in annexin A1 knockout mice. While tumor is a piece of heterogeneous mass including not only malignant tumor cells but also the stroma, the importance of the tumor stroma for tumor progression and metastasis is becoming increasingly clear. The tumor stroma is comprised by various components including extracellular matrix and non-malignant cells in the tumor, such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, inflammatory cells. Based on our previous finding of pro-angiogenic functions for annexin A1 in vascular endothelial cell sprouting, wound healing, tumor growth and metastasis, and the previously known properties for annexin A1 in immune cells and inflammation, this study hypothesized that annexin A1 is a key functional player in tumor development, linking the various components in tumor stroma by its actions in endothelial cells and immune cells. Using systems analysis programs commercially available, this paper further compared the gene expression between tumors from annexin A1 wild type mice and annexin A1 knockout mice and found a list of genes that significantly changed in the tumor stroma that lacked annexin A1. This revealed annexin A1 to be an effective regulator in tumor stroma and suggested a mechanism that annexin A1 affects tumor development and metastasis through interaction with the various components in the microenvironment surrounding the tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2027557466,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a prominent cause of airway morbidity in children, maintains an excessive hospitalization rate despite decades of research. Host factors are assumed to influence the disease severity. As a first step toward identifying the underlying resistance mechanisms, we recently showed that inbred mouse strains differ dramatically as regards their susceptibility to pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), the murine counterpart of RSV. PVM infection in mice has been shown to faithfully mimic the severe RSV disease in human infants. This study aimed at dissecting the remarkable PVM-resistance shown by the SJL/J strain. To characterize its genetic component, we assessed clinical, physiopathological, and virological resistance/susceptibility traits in large first (F1) and second (F2) generations obtained by crossing the SJL/J (resistant) and 129/Sv (susceptible) strains. Then, to acquire conclusive in vivo evidence in support of the hypothesis that certain radiosensitive hematopoietic cells might play a significant role in PVM-resistance, we monitored the same resistance/susceptibility traits in mock- and γ-irradiated SJL/J mice. Segregation analysis showed that (i) PVM-resistance is polygenic, (ii) the resistance alleles are recessive, and (iii) all resistance-encoding alleles are concentrated in SJL/J. Furthermore, there was no alteration of SJL/J PVM-resistance after immunosuppression by γ-irradiation, which suggests that adaptive immunity is not involved. We conclude that host resistance to pneumoviruses should be amenable to genetic dissection in this mouse model and that radioresistant lung epithelial cells and/or alveolar macrophages may control the clinical severity of pneumovirus-associated lung disease."
