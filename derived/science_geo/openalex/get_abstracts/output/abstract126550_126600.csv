https://openalex.org/W2042143995,"Tat is an 86-amino acid protein involved in the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Several studies have shown that exogenous Tat protein was able to translocate through the plasma membrane and to reach the nucleus to transactivate the viral genome. A region of the Tat protein centered on a cluster of basic amino acids has been assigned to this translocation activity. Recent data have demonstrated that chemical coupling of a Tat-derived peptide (extending from residues 37 to 72) to several proteins allowed their functional internalization into several cell lines or tissues. A part of this same domain can be folded in an α-helix structure with amphipathic characteristics. Such helical structures have been considered as key determinants for the uptake of several enveloped viruses by fusion or endocytosis. In the present study, we have delineated the main determinants required for Tat translocation within this sequence by synthesizing several peptides covering the Tat domain from residues 37 to 60. Unexpectedly, the domain extending from amino acid 37 to 47, which corresponds to the α-helix structure, is not required for cellular uptake and for nuclear translocation. Peptide internalization was assessed by direct labeling with fluorescein or by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody directed against the Tat basic cluster. Both approaches established that all peptides containing the basic domain are taken up by cells within less than 5 min at concentrations as low as 100 nm. In contrast, a peptide with a full α-helix but with a truncated basic amino acid cluster is not taken up by cells. The internalization process does not involve an endocytic pathway, as no inhibition of the uptake was observed at 4 °C. Similar observations have been reported for a basic amino acid-rich peptide derived from the Antennapedia homeodomain (1). Short peptides allowing efficient translocation through the plasma membrane could be useful vectors for the intracellular delivery of various non-permeant drugs including antisense oligonucleotides and peptides of pharmacological interest.

Short peptides allowing efficient translocation through the plasma membrane could be useful vectors for the intracellular delivery of various non-permeant drugs including antisense oligonucleotides and peptides of pharmacological interest. Most “information-rich” molecules, such as oligonucleotides, genes, peptides, or proteins, are poorly taken up by cells since they do not efficiently cross the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane or of the endocytic vesicles (Ref. 2Lebleu B. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, and references therein). This is considered to be a major limitation for their ex vivo orin vivo use in fundamental studies or in possible clinical applications. These compounds are currently delivered by various techniques including microinjection, electroporation, association with cationic lipids, liposome encapsidation, or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Various problems have been encountered in their use including low transfer efficiency, complex manipulation, cellular toxicity, or immunogenicity, which would preclude their routine usein vivo. As an alternative, several peptides have been successfully used to improve the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids or proteins. The fusogenic properties of influenza virus have been extensively studied in this context. They are currently assigned to a pH-dependent conformational change of the viral hemagglutinin leading to the exposure of its hydrophobic N-terminal region, and to the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes (3Plank C. Oberhauser B. Mechtler K. Koch C. Wagner E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12918-12924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Tat mRNA-specific antisense oligonucleotide covalently bound to this fusogenic peptide has been demonstrated to have an increased antiviral activity in vitro, probably as a result of increased cellular uptake (4Bongartz J.P. Aubertin A.-M. Milhaud P.G. Lebleu B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4681-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Peptides adopting an amphipathic conformation at acidic pH largely increased the delivery of plasmid DNA complexed with transferrin-polylysine conjugates (5Wagner E. Plank C. Zatloukal K. Cotten M. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7934-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Likewise, amphipathic characteristics have been described for a peptide derived from the third domain of Antennapedia homeodomain (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which allows the delivery of antisense oligonucleotides or biologically active peptides. Interestingly, this peptide was efficiently translocated through the plasma membrane in the absence of energy (e.g. via a mechanism that does not involve endocytosis).

Tat transactivation protein is efficiently taken up by cells (6Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 23: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 7Mann D.A. Frankel A.D.

Virol. 1994; 68: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and concentrations as low as 1 nm in the culture media are sufficient to transactivate a reporter gene expressed from the HIV-1 promoter (6Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 23: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). The domain responsible for this translocation has been ascribed to the region centered on a basic domain of the Tat protein. A peptide extending from residues 37 to 72 allowed the internalization of conjugated proteins such as β-galactosidase or horseradish peroxidase (9Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). One to two Tat peptides/molecule of protein were sufficient to induce efficient translocation. Likewise, the Tat-(37–62) sequence conjugated to a Fab antibody fragment enhanced its in vitro cell surface association and internalization (10Anderson D.C. Nochols E. Manger R. Woodle D. Barry M. Fritzberg A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Physicochemical studies involving circular dichroism and energy minimization indicated that the region covering the Tat-(38–49) domain adopted an α-helical structure with amphipathic characteristics (11Loret E.P. Vivès E. Ho P.S. Rochat H. Van Rietschoten J. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6013-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both biological data and physicochemical studies were in keeping with a crucial role of the α-helix forming domain in Tat uptake. Most of these studies have concerned peptides extending from residues 37 to 72. These include other motifs of interest and in particular a cluster of basic amino acids extending from positions 49 to 58, which does not overlap the presumed amphipathic helical structure. This cluster of basic amino acids (Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg-Arg) appears to be unstructured due to charge repulsions (11Loret E.P. Vivès E. Ho P.S. Rochat H. Van Rietschoten J. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6013-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence (12Ruben S. Perkins A. Purcell R. Jounc K. Sia R. Burghoff R. Haseltine W.A. Rosen C.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To delineate more precisely which determinants of the Tat-(37–60) peptide are crucial for Tat translocation and nucleolar localization, we have synthesized peptides harboring deletions in the purported α-helix domain or in the basic cluster. These peptides were assayed for their ability to translocate through the cell membrane in several cell lines. Cellular uptake and intracellular distribution were monitored by fluorescence microscopy using peptides labeled with fluorescein maleimide on their C-terminal cysteine or by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody directed against the Tat basic domain. Unexpectedly, the α-helix region did not appear to be required for efficient and fast cell uptake. In contrast, the whole basic domain from the Tat peptide appeared necessary for cell internalization.DISCUSSIONSeveral strategies have been proposed to improve the cellular uptake of proteins or nucleic acids. Some of these are based on the use of peptide sequences from proteins known to translocate through the plasma membrane. Along these lines, the HIV-1 Tat protein is able to cross the plasma membrane and to reach the cell nucleus to transactivate the viral genome (6Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 23: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 7Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 8Vivès E. Charneau P. Van Rietschoten J. Rochat H. Bahraoui E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a 35-amino acid peptide from Tat is able to promote the intracellular delivery of covalently bound proteins such as β-galactosidase, RNase A, or horseradish peroxidase in several cell lines and tissues (9Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). This peptide contains a cluster of basic amino acids extending from residues 49 to 58 and a sequence assumed to adopt an α-helical configuration (11Loret E.P. Vivès E. Ho P.S. Rochat H. Van Rietschoten J. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6013-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The present study aimed at delineating whether shorter domains from this Tat peptide would be sufficient for cell internalization. The main determinant required for translocation was identified as the cluster of basic amino acids while the putative α-helix domain appeared dispensable. The full basic domain is required since a peptide deleted from the three arginine residues at its C-terminal end is not taken up by cells, even at high concentration. In keeping with a requirement for the full complement of positive charges in the Tat basic domain, any deletion or substitution of basic charges within the Tat-(48–60) peptide led to a reduced membrane translocating activity. 2E. Vivès, C. Granier, P. Prévot, and B. Lebleu (1997) Lett. Pept. Sci., in press. Shorter peptides such as Tat-(37–58) or Tat-(47–58) were less efficient carriers of proteins than the original 35-amino acid peptide (9Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). A steric hindrance between such short peptides and the bound protein could have reduced their availability for translocation.Along the same lines, a 16-amino acid peptide from the Antennapedia third helix homeodomain was described as having a good translocation ability through the plasma membrane, and it was initially assumed that its α-helix structure was important (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the fusogenic properties of several viral peptides have been ascribed to α-helical determinants (17Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W.H. Brunner J. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1541-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, it was recently established that the insertion of proline residues, known to disrupt α-helical structures, did not abolish the translocation of the Antennapedia peptide (18Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The sequence of this active Antennapedia peptide analogue is Arg-Gln-Ile-Lys-Ile-Trp-Phe-Gln-Asn-Arg-Arg-Met-Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys. It contains five positive charges (two Arg and three Lys) within a linear sequence of seven residues at its C-terminal end. Similarly, the short Tat basic peptide described here contains eight positive charges within a sequence of nine residues. It is noteworthy that a shorter peptide from Antennapedia deleted of the C-terminal Trp-Lys-Lys residues (i.e. lacking two positive charges) was not internalized (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the tryptophan residue was shown to play a role in the translocation event (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an additional effect of the two Lys residues was not evaluated independently. The data reported with the Antennapedia peptide and those obtained in the present study with the Tat peptide strongly suggest that internalization could be linked to the presence of a high density of positive charges within a short sequence.Both the full-length Antennapedia (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the Tat-(48–60) peptides (Fig. 1) are taken up efficiently at 4 °C. Likewise, several drugs known to interfere with caveolae-mediated uptake did not affect Tat uptake in our studies. Altogether, these studies strongly suggest that endocytosis is not involved in the uptake of these short basic peptides. On the other hand, the incubation of the Tat peptides with various unbound fluorochromes or with a non-permeant peptide did not induce their uptake. Taken together, these experiments do not support the involvement of a significant membrane disruption by Tat basic peptides or a well defined internalization pathway.The mechanism of translocation of the Tat basic peptide could be analogous to the model proposed for the Antennapedia homeodomain peptide (18Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). A tight ionic interaction between the basic groups of the peptide side chains and the negative charges of the phospholipid heads could induce a local invagination of the plasma membrane. The local reorganization of the phospholipid bilayer would then lead to the formation of inverted micelles with the peptide enclosed in the hydrophilic cavity and ultimately to the cytoplasmic release of the peptide. Because of the presence of a nuclear localization signal, the Tat peptide is rapidly translocated and concentrates in the nucleus. This would limit its release from the cell by the same mechanism. Further experiments are in progress to assess the reality of this working hypothesis. Additional studies will be required to define more accurately the structural requirements for this translocation activity and to uncover the mechanism by which Tat and possibly other basic peptides cross the plasma membrane.The translocation activity of such small Tat-derived peptides is powerful, as nuclear localization was observed after a few minutes of incubation with the cells. Internalization could be monitored in the micromolar concentration range by indirect immunofluorescence with peptide-specific antibodies or even at an order of magnitude lower by direct labeling of the peptide with a fluorochrome. Previous studies with the Antennapedia peptide made use of incubation times of several hours and routine concentrations of 20 μm (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences were confirmed in a comparative study using the same fluorescein-labeling method for both peptides with Antennapedia peptide kindly provided by G. Chassaing and A. Prochiantz (CNRS URA1414, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France) (data not shown).The indirect immunodetection of the Tat peptide ensures that its ability to translocate through the plasma membrane was not altered by the reporter group itself. In most published studies, the possible influence of the fluorochrome reporter group or of the biotin-linking arm on the behavior of the peptide was not assessed. Along these lines, the biotinylation of a Tat peptide increased by 6-fold its uptake as compared with the non-biotinylated peptide (19Chen L., L. Frankel A.D. Harder J.L. Fawell S. Barsoum J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The internalization properties of these small Tat basic peptides could then be exploited for the intracellular delivery and for the nuclear targeting of conjugated non-permeant molecules. Ongoing work in our group aims at establishing whether the covalent conjugation through various linking arms of short Tat basic peptides to antisense oligonucleotides, to peptide nucleic acids, or to peptides will lead to their nuclear accumulation. Preliminary data indicate that a peptide which did not enter the cell by itself could be efficiently internalized when conjugated to the shorter Tat peptide.2Along the same lines the covalent linking of a 15-mer oligonucleotides to the 16-amino acid Antennapedia peptide led to improved intracellular delivery and to a significant increase in biological activity (20Allinquant B. Hantraye P. Mailleux P. Moya K. Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).Peptides bearing a high density of basic residues might also improve hybridization properties of antisense oligonucleotides. Previous studies have indeed described the enhanced affinities and kinetics of hybridization for its target sequence of an oligonucleotide covalently linked to a polyarginine sequence (21Wei Z. Tung C.H. Zhu T. Dickerhof W.A. Breslauer K.J. Georgopoulos D.E. Leibowitz M.J. Stein S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Most “information-rich” molecules, such as oligonucleotides, genes, peptides, or proteins, are poorly taken up by cells since they do not efficiently cross the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane or of the endocytic vesicles (Ref. 2Lebleu B. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, and references therein). This is considered to be a major limitation for their ex vivo orin vivo use in fundamental studies or in possible clinical applications. These compounds are currently delivered by various techniques including microinjection, electroporation, association with cationic lipids, liposome encapsidation, or receptor-mediated endocytosis.

A Tat mRNA-specific antisense oligonucleotide covalently bound to this fusogenic peptide has been demonstrated to have an increased antiviral activity in vitro, probably as a result of increased cellular uptake (4Bongartz J.P. Aubertin A.-M. Milhaud P.G. Lebleu B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4681-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Peptides adopting an amphipathic conformation at acidic pH largely increased the delivery of plasmid DNA complexed with transferrin-polylysine conjugates (5Wagner E. Plank C. Zatloukal K. Cotten M. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7934-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Likewise, amphipathic characteristics have been described for a peptide derived from the third domain of Antennapedia homeodomain (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol.

A steric hindrance between such short peptides and the bound protein could have reduced their availability for translocation.Along the same lines, a 16-amino acid peptide from the Antennapedia third helix homeodomain was described as having a good translocation ability through the plasma membrane, and it was initially assumed that its α-helix structure was important (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the fusogenic properties of several viral peptides have been ascribed to α-helical determinants (17Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W.H. Brunner J. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1541-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, it was recently established that the insertion of proline residues, known to disrupt α-helical structures, did not abolish the translocation of the Antennapedia peptide (18Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The sequence of this active Antennapedia peptide analogue is Arg-Gln-Ile-Lys-Ile-Trp-Phe-Gln-Asn-Arg-Arg-Met-Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys. It contains five positive charges (two Arg and three Lys) within a linear sequence of seven residues at its C-terminal end. Similarly, the short Tat basic peptide described here contains eight positive charges within a sequence of nine residues. It is noteworthy that a shorter peptide from Antennapedia deleted of the C-terminal Trp-Lys-Lys residues (i.e. lacking two positive charges) was not internalized (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the tryptophan residue was shown to play a role in the translocation event (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an additional effect of the two Lys residues was not evaluated independently. The data reported with the Antennapedia peptide and those obtained in the present study with the Tat peptide strongly suggest that internalization could be linked to the presence of a high density of positive charges within a short sequence.Both the full-length Antennapedia (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the Tat-(48–60) peptides (Fig. 1) are taken up efficiently at 4 °C. Likewise, several drugs known to interfere with caveolae-mediated uptake did not affect Tat uptake in our studies. Altogether, these studies strongly suggest that endocytosis is not involved in the uptake of these short basic peptides. On the other hand, the incubation of the Tat peptides with various unbound fluorochromes or with a non-permeant peptide did not induce their uptake. Taken together, these experiments do not support the involvement of a significant membrane disruption by Tat basic peptides or a well defined internalization pathway.The mechanism of translocation of the Tat basic peptide could be analogous to the model proposed for the Antennapedia homeodomain peptide (18Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). A tight ionic interaction between the basic groups of the peptide side chains and the negative charges of the phospholipid heads could induce a local invagination of the plasma membrane. The local reorganization of the phospholipid bilayer would then lead to the formation of inverted micelles with the peptide enclosed in the hydrophilic cavity and ultimately to the cytoplasmic release of the peptide. Because of the presence of a nuclear localization signal, the Tat peptide is rapidly translocated and concentrates in the nucleus. This would limit its release from the cell by the same mechanism. Further experiments are in progress to assess the reality of this working hypothesis. Additional studies will be required to define more accurately the structural requirements for this translocation activity and to uncover the mechanism by which Tat and possibly other basic peptides cross the plasma membrane.The translocation activity of such small Tat-derived peptides is powerful, as nuclear localization was observed after a few minutes of incubation with the cells. Internalization could be monitored in the micromolar concentration range by indirect immunofluorescence with peptide-specific antibodies or even at an order of magnitude lower by direct labeling of the peptide with a fluorochrome. Previous studies with the Antennapedia peptide made use of incubation times of several hours and routine concentrations of 20 μm (1Derossi D. Joliot H.A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences were confirmed in a comparative study using the same fluorescein-labeling method for both peptides with Antennapedia peptide kindly provided by G. Chassaing and A. Prochiantz (CNRS URA1414, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France) (data not shown).The indirect immunodetection of the Tat peptide ensures that its ability to translocate through the plasma membrane was not altered by the reporter group itself. In most published studies, the possible influence of the fluorochrome reporter group or of the biotin-linking arm on the behavior of the peptide was not assessed. Along these lines, the biotinylation of a Tat peptide increased by 6-fold its uptake as compared with the non-biotinylated peptide (19Chen L., L. Frankel A.D. Harder J.L. Fawell S. Barsoum J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The internalization properties of these small Tat basic peptides could then be exploited for the intracellular delivery and for the nuclear targeting of conjugated non-permeant molecules. Ongoing work in our group aims at establishing whether the covalent conjugation through various linking arms of short Tat basic peptides to antisense oligonucleotides, to peptide nucleic acids, or to peptides will lead to their nuclear accumulation. Preliminary data indicate that a peptide which did not enter the cell by itself could be efficiently internalized when conjugated to the shorter Tat peptide.2Along the same lines the covalent linking of a 15-mer oligonucleotides to the 16-amino acid Antennapedia peptide led to improved intracellular delivery and to a significant increase in biological activity (20Allinquant B. Hantraye P. Mailleux P. Moya K. Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).Peptides bearing a high density of basic residues might also improve hybridization properties of antisense oligonucleotides. Previous studies have indeed described the enhanced affinities and kinetics of hybridization for its target sequence of an oligonucleotide covalently linked to a polyarginine sequence (21Wei Z. Tung C.H. Zhu T. Dickerhof W.A. Breslauer K.J. Georgopoulos D.E. Leibowitz M.J. Stein S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Several strategies have been proposed to improve the cellular uptake of proteins or nucleic acids. Some of these are based on the use of peptide sequences from proteins known to translocate through the plasma membrane. Along these lines, the HIV-1 Tat protein is able to cross the plasma membrane and to reach the cell nucleus to transactivate the viral genome (6Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 23: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 7Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 8Vivès E. Charneau P. Van Rietschoten J. Rochat H. Bahraoui E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a 35-amino acid peptide from Tat is able to promote the intracellular delivery of covalently bound proteins such as β-galactosidase, RNase A, or horseradish peroxidase in several cell lines and tissues (9Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). This peptide contains a cluster of basic amino acids extending from residues 49 to 58 and a sequence assumed to adopt an α-helical configuration (11Loret E.P. Vivès E. Ho P.S. Rochat H. Van Rietschoten J. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6013-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The present study aimed at delineating whether shorter domains from this Tat peptide would be sufficient for cell internalization. The main determinant required for translocation was identified as the cluster of basic amino acids while the putative α-helix domain appeared dispensable. The full basic domain is required since a peptide deleted from the three arginine residues at its C-terminal end is not taken up by cells, even at high concentration. In keeping with a requirement for the full complement of positive charges in the Tat basic domain, any deletion or substitution of basic charges within the Tat-(48–60) peptide led to a reduced membrane translocating activity. 2E. Vivès, C. Granier, P. Prévot, and B. Lebleu (1997) Lett. Pept. Sci., in press. Shorter peptides such as Tat-(37–58) or Tat-(47–58) were less efficient carriers of proteins than the original 35-amino acid peptide (9Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J.

https://openalex.org/W2033570433,"In polarized epithelial cells [Ca2+] i waves are initiated in discrete regions and propagate through the cytosol. The structural basis for these compartmentalized and coordinated events are not well understood. In the present study we used a combination of [Ca2+] i imaging at high temporal resolution, recording of Ca2+-activated Cl− current, and immunolocalization by confocal microscopy to study the correlation between initiation and propagation of [Ca2+] i waves and localization of Ca2+ release channels in pancreatic acini and submandibular acinar and duct cells. In all cells Ca2+ waves are initiated in the luminal pole and propagate through the cell periphery to the basal pole. All three cell types express the three known inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Expression of IP3Rs was confined to the area just underneath the luminal and lateral membranes, with no detectable receptors in the basal pole or other regions of the cells. In pancreatic acini and SMG ducts IP3R3 was also found in the nuclear envelope. Expression of ryanodine receptor was detected in submandibular salivary gland cells but not pancreatic acini. Accordingly, cyclic ADP ribose was very effective in mobilizing Ca2+ from internal stores of submandibular salivary gland but not pancreatic acinar cells. Measurement of [Ca2+] i and localization of IP3Rs in the same cells suggests that only a small part of IP3Rs participate in the initiation of the Ca2+ wave, whereas most receptors in the cell periphery probably facilitate the propagation of the Ca2+ wave. The combined results together with our previous studies on this subject lead us to conclude that the internal Ca2+ pool is highly compartmentalized and that compartmentalization is achieved in part by polarized expression of Ca2+ channels.

Ca2+ mobilizing agonists trigger several forms of [Ca2+] i signals, which include [Ca2+] i oscillations and Ca2+ waves (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). It has now been recognized in many cell types that Ca2+ signaling is highly organized and compartmentalized. This issue has been extensively discussed in a series of recent reviews in a special issue of Cell Calcium (2Cell Calcium (Special Issue)Cell Calcium2095226Berridge, M. J. (ed) (1996) Cell Calcium (Special Issue), 20, 95–226.Google Scholar). In the case of pancreatic acini compartmentalization of signaling and intracellular Ca2+ pools was suggested when the quantal nature of Ca2+ release from internal stores (3Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tortorici G. Zhang B.-X. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29621-29628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was described. Subsequently, a series of elegant papers demonstrated the specialization of the luminal pole (LP) 1The abbreviations used are: LP, luminal pole; SMG, submandibular salivary gland; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor; IP3R1, type 1 IP3R; IP3R2, type 2 IP3R; IP3R3, type 3 IP3R; RyR, ryanodine receptor; cADPR, cyclic ADP ribose; SLO, streptolysin O toxin; IS, internal stores; WB, Western blot; IC, immunocytochemistry; pAb, polyclonal antibodies; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Ab, antibody; PSA, pancreatic solution A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. of these cells. Ca2+ waves tended to start in this region and spread to the basal pole (BP) (5Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 346: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Kasai H. Li Y.X.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When the cells are stimulated to trigger [Ca2+] i oscillations, the oscillation tended to occur in and remain confined to the LP (6Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 7Thorn P. Lawrie A. Smith P.A. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 9Thorn P. Moreton R. Berridge M.S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similar LP oscillations could be initiated with infusion of low concentration of IP3 into the cells (7Thorn P. Lawrie A. Smith P.A. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 9Thorn P. Moreton R. Berridge M.S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently we showed a higher order of organization of Ca2+ signaling in this pole, in that the initiation site of Ca2+ waves was agonist specific in the same cell type (10Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The structural features responsible for the compartmentalized organization of Ca2+ signaling in acinar and other cell types are not well understood. Several findings suggest that the properties of IP3-mediated Ca2+ release may account for the specialization of the LP. Analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and WB showed the presence of all three types of IP3R in the pancreas (11DeSmedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Bootman M.D. Mertens L. Van Den Bosch L. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21691-21698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, for the most part, their specific cellular expression and localization is not known. In one study clear localization of type 3 IP3R (IP3R3) in the LP has been reported (13Nathanson M.H. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4693-4696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Propagation of the Ca2+ wave from the LP to the BP was suggested to occur through a series of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release events mediated by the ryanodine receptor (RyR) (5Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 346: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Petersen O.H. Petersen C.C.H. Kasai H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 297-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it was reported that cADPR, an activator of the RyR (15Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), releases Ca2+ from the IS of pancreatic acini (16Thorn P. Gerasimenko O. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). More recently Gerasimenko et al. (17Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) reported that the secretory granules, which are located in the LP, release Ca2+ in response to IP3 and cADPR. Compared with pancreatic acini, there is little information on Ca2+ signaling by SMG acinar and duct cells. Several studies reported the response of the two cell types to Ca2+-mobilizing agonists including carbachol, epinephrine, substance P, and isoproterenol (18Valdez I.H. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G359-G363PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dinudom A. Porronnik P. Allen D.G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Studying Ca2+signaling in SMG cells has several advantages. First, it allowed us to determine the generality of polarized arrangement of Ca2+signaling and expression of Ca2+ transporters in secretory epithelial cells. Second, SMG cells were shown to express mRNA for type 1 RyR (21Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), which allows a more clear evaluation of the role of RyR in Ca2+ signaling in polarized cells. Third and most important for this study, is that the SMG duct is a single layer epithelium with very well defined LP and BP, which allows an unequivocal localization of Ca2+ transporters, in particular the Ca2+ pumps described in the accompanying manuscript (33Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15771-15776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the present study we used [Ca2+] i imaging at high temporal resolution to show that in all three cell types Ca2+ waves start in the LP and spread through the cell periphery to the BP. This pattern correlated well with the polarized expression of IP3Rs in all cells and RyR in SMG cells. The results also highlight the problem of the mechanism of Ca2+wave propagation in the face of the paucity of Ca2+ release channels from the cell interior. cADPR was purchased from Calbiochem or Sigma.

Two anti-ryanodine receptor Abs were used, mAb Clone 34-C from Affinity Bioreagents (22Airey J.A. Beck C.F. Murakami K. Tanksley S.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Sutko J.L. J. Biol.

The pancreas and SMG of 100–150-g rats were removed immediately after sacrifice of animals, immersed in the O.C.T. compound (Miles, Elkhard, IN) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen glands were used to cut 4-μm sections. The sections were plated on polylysine-coated slides, dried, and kept at −20 °C until use. A mixture of acini and duct fragments from all glands were prepared by published procedures (4Tortorici G. Zhang B.-X. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29621-29628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cells were kept suspended in cold PSA until use. The composition of PSA was (in mm) NaCl 140, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, Hepes 10 (pH 7.4 with NaOH), glucose 10, pyruvate 10, bovine serum albumin 0.1%, and soybean trypsin inhibitor 0.02%. After removal of the glands and fine mincing, the minced pancreas was treated with trypsin/EDTA and then collagenase to liberate single pancreatic acinar cells exactly as described before (24Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The minced SMG was washed once with 20 ml of PSA by 10 s of centrifugation at 120 ×g. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of PSA containing 0.8 mg/ml collagenase type CLS4, 254 units/mg (Worthington) and was digested for 20 min at 37 °C. The tissue was washed twice with a PBS solution resuspended in 5 ml of PBS containing 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA and incubated for 8 min at 37 °C. The trypsin-treated tissue was washed twice with 30 ml of PSA, resuspended in 6 ml of PSA containing 0.53 mg/ml collagenase CLS4, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with 20 ml of PSA by a 2-min centrifugation at 150 × g and kept on ice until use. Single duct and acinar cells were distinguishable by microscopy based on their different size, and their identity was verified during electrophysiological recording by measurement of membrane capacitance that averaged 19.74 ± 0.55 picofarad (n = 12) in acinar and 4.33 ± 0.06 picofarad (n = 6) in duct cells. Loading cells with Fura 2 and image acquisition and analysis was as detailed before (10Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Acini and ducts with well defined basal and apical borders were selected for experimentation. To maximize the temporal resolution, fluorescence was measured at a single excitation wavelength of 380 nm, averaging four consecutive images for each time point. Under these conditions using a frame size of 256 × 240 pixels allowed recording the fluorescence of 4–5 acinar cells at a resolution of up to 7.7 Hz. During perfusion with the control solution and just before the first stimulation, the image of the resting cells was acquired. This was taken as the fluorescence at time 0 (F 0). Pixel values of all subsequent images were divided by this image, and the traces are the calculatedF 0/F t, whereF t is the fluorescence at time t. For the experiments in Figs. 7 and 8 at the end of fluorescence recording, the perfusion medium was aspirated, and the bright field image at high (experimental) and low magnification was recorded. Then the bottom of the coverslip was tagged with a marker before fixation and extraction of the cells with cold methanol. The extracted cells were processed for IC staining with IP3Rs Ab as described below. At the end of Ab staining, coordinates were labeled around the tag, the tag was cleared to allow imaging by confocal microscopy, and the coordinates together with the low magnification bright field image were used to identify the cell cluster from which [Ca2+] i was recorded.Figure 7Correlation between IP3Rs localization and [Ca2+] i initiation sites in SMG acinar cells. SMG acinar cells loaded with Fura 2 were imaged at a temporal resolution of 7.7 Hz. The bright field images were recorded before and after fluorescence recording and at high (panel ain each series) or low magnification. At the end of the [Ca2+] i measurement the cells were fixed and stained with pAb against IP3R1 (A) and IP3R2 (B) and with mAb against IP3R3 (C). In each A–C the first image is the bright field image (a), the second is theF 0/F 0.13 s ratio (b), and the last is the confocal image of the respective IP3R (c).

Tortorici G. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17132-17135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SLO permeabilization medium was composed of a Chelex-treated solution containing 145 mm KCl and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2 with NaOH) and supplemented with 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 3 mmATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 10 μmantimycin A, 10 μm oligomycin, 1 μm Fluo 3, and 3 mg/ml SLO (Difco). Fluo 3 fluorescence was recorded and calibrated as detailed previously (25Zhang B.-X. Tortorici G. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17132-17135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tight seal whole cell current recording of the patch clamp technique (26Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) was used for measurement of Ca2+-activated Cl− current, which directly correlates with changes in [Ca2+] i (27Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed with single acinar or duct cells perfused with solution A. The standard pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl 140, MgCl2 1, EGTA 0.5, Na2ATP 5, and Hepes 10 (pH 7.3 with KOH) as described in previous studies (25Zhang B.-X. Tortorici G. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17132-17135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments this solution also contained 1–100 μm cADPR and 1.5 mg/ml heparin. Seals of 6–10 gigaohms were produced on the cell membrane, and the whole cell configuration was obtained by gentle suction or voltage pulses of 0.5 V for 0.3–1 ms. The patch clamp output (Axopatch-1B, Axon Instruments) was filtered at 20 Hz. Recording was performed with patch clamp 6 and a Digi-Data 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). In all experiments the Cl− and cation equilibrium potentials were about 0 mV. All the traces shown were at a holding potential of −40 mV. Packed, purified pancreatic acini, and SMG ducts and acini were extracted with a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8 with HCl), 8 m urea, 2% SDS, and 100 mm dithiothreitol in a ratio of 1:2. 10-μl samples containing about 75 μg of protein were separated by an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were blocked by a 1-h incubation at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS). The IP3Rs were detected by a 1–2-h incubation of individual membranes with the respective Ab diluted in TTBS. Tissue slices and the cells attached to glass coverslips used for [Ca2+] i measurements were fixed and permeabilized with 0.5 ml of cold methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. After removal of methanol, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 50 mm glycine for 10 min at room temperature. This buffer was aspirated and the nonspecific sites were blocked by a 1 h incubation at room temperature with 0.25 ml of a PBS solution containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin (blocking medium). The medium was aspirated and replaced with 50 μl of blocking medium containing control serum or a 1:50 dilution of pAb against IP3R1 and IP3R2, 1:25 dilution of pAb and 1:2000 dilution of mAb against IP3R3, and 1:250 dilution of mAb against the RyR. In several control experiments, the primary pAbs against the different IP3Rs were preincubated with the respective peptides used to raise them (see Ref. 12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Such preincubation completely blocked detection of the respective IP3Rs by WB or IC. After incubation with the primary Ab for 1.5 h at room temperature and three washes with blocking medium, the Ab were detected with goat IgG tagged with fluorescein. Images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal microscope. In a previous study we showed that in maximally stimulated pancreatic acini, Ca2+ waves tend to initiate in the apical pole and spread through the cell periphery to the basal pole (10Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig.1 and Table I show that this is not a unique phenomenon to pancreatic cells, because it can be demonstrated in SMG acinar and duct cells. With all agonists the Ca2+wave tended to initiate in the LP or the lateral region adjacent to the LP. However, differences among agonists were noted in terms of wave speed and the time required to cause maximal increase in [Ca2+] i. Epinephrine induced the fastest wave in duct cells; the [Ca2+] i wave initiated by isoproterenol in duct cells was significantly slower than the others as well as the time required to achieve peak Ca2+ (Table I). It is important to note that acinar cells are about 2.5 times bigger than duct cells, which indicates that the wave travels about 2–3 times faster in SMG acinar compared with duct cells.Table IProperties of agonist-evoked [Ca 2+] i waves in SMG acinar and duct cellsCellAgonistInitiation sitesTime to spreadTime to peakLumenLateralBasalsSMG AciniCarbachol4 /73 /70 /70.65 ± 0.131.14 ± 0.18Substance P3 /85 /80 /80.71 ± 0.071.27 ± 0.20Epinephrine7 /70 /70 /70.56 ± 0.081.65 ± 0.22SMG DuctEpinephrine8 /101 /101 /100.42 ± 0.090.92 ± 0.10Carbachol5 /83 /80 /80.89 ± 0.171.59 ± 0.22Isoproterenol5 /103 /102 /101.02 ± 0.092.18 ± 0.13Protocols similar to those in Fig. 1 were used to identify the initiation sites of the [Ca2+] i waves.

The results are given as means ± S.E. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were measured in time to spread and time to peak in duct cells when stimulation with epinephrine is compared to that of other agonists. Open table in a new tab Protocols similar to those in Fig. 1 were used to identify the initiation sites of the [Ca2+] i waves. Time to spread is defined as the time between traces 1 and 5 in each experiment, and time to peak is the time needed to achieve maximal [Ca2+] i increase in region 1 in each cell. The results are given as means ± S.E. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were measured in time to spread and time to peak in duct cells when stimulation with epinephrine is compared to that of other agonists. To study whether and how the expression of different IP3Rs in specific parts of the cells correlate with the [Ca2+] i wave, we analyzed the expression of type 1–3 IP3R by WB and determined their localization by IC in pancreatic and SMG cells. Fig.2 shows WB analysis of the different IP3R in pancreatic acini and SMG duct and acinar cells. For this we took advantage of our technique for separation between SMG acinar and duct cells, which yield better than 95% pure duct and acinar preparations (20Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). IP3Rs in all cells were sensitive to proteolysis. Including 100 mm of the potent protease inhibitor benzamidine and 0.3% soybean trypsin inhibitor reduced the intensity of minor bands and increased the level of intact receptors. However, even under these conditions proteolysis could not be completely prevented. Because of this problem it is not possible to reliably determine the relative abundance of the different types of IP3R. In the case of IP3R3 we used two separate Ab to verify the expression of this receptor because the two Ab gave somewhat different results in IC (see below). Both Abs showed that SMG acinar cells express the highest level of IP3R3. The pAb, but not the mAb, detected expression of IP3R3 in SMG ducts. The relative intensity of labeling of SMG duct and acini by the pAb (about 1:3) excludes contamination of the duct preparation with acini as the source of labeling. Previously only the localization of IP3R3 in the LP of pancreatic acini has been reported (13Nathanson M.H. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4693-4696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 demonstrates the localization of all IP3Rs in the LP of pancreatic acini and SMG acinar and duct cells. Remarkably all three epithelial cell types expressed high levels of IP3R1 and IP3R2 only close to the luminal and lateral membranes. In additional experiments when up to 2–3 times higher concentrations of Ab were used, still no IP3R expression could be observed in any region of the cells beyond that shown in Fig. 3. Cell-specific expression and localization was observed with IP3R3 using two different Ab, a pAb raised against a 13-amino acid sequence of the C-terminal of IP3R3 (12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and a mAb raised against amino acids 22–230 of IP3R3 (28Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1222-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In pancreatic acini both Ab detected expression of IP3R3 in the LP and next to the lateral membrane, which closely resembled that of IP3R1 and IP3R2. However, only the pAb detected expression around the nuclear envelope. The ability of the pAb but not the mAb to detect the IP3R3 in the nuclear envelope is further highlighted when the pattern of expression of IP3R3 in the SMG is examined. In SMG acini, expression of IP3R3 was confined to the LP and lateral membrane. With the pAb IP3R3 was detected only around the nuclear envelope of duct cells. The mAb did not stain the SMG duct. Unlike both types of acini, the SM duct did not express any IP3R3 in the LP or lateral membrane. After submission of the present study similar localization of IP3Rs in pancreatic acini using the same pAb was reported (29Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The confinement of IP3R expression to just underneath the luminal and lateral membranes in the face of the propagated Ca2+ waves raised the possibility that RyR may mediate the propagation of the waves. We expected all cell types to express the RyR because it was reported that cADPR releases Ca2+ from IS (16Thorn P. Gerasimenko O. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and isolated zymogen granules (17Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) of pancreatic acini and the SMG express type 1 RyR (21Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The use of mAb that recognize all isoforms of known RyR and functional characterization of Ca2+ release showed that this may not be the case. Fig. 4 shows that we could not detect any RyR in pancreatic acini by IC. On the other hand both SMG acinar and duct cells stained by the same Ab. Also in this case expression of RyR was confined to the LP and lateral membrane. Considering the reported effect of cADPR on Ca2+ release in pancreatic acini (16Thorn P. Gerasimenko O. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of this compound on Ca2+ release from IS of pancreatic acini and SM cells using two different experimental protocols. In Fig.5 A it is shown that 10 μm cADPR infused through a patch pipette into pancreatic acinar cells caused Ca2+ release from IS. However, with 10 μmcADPR Ca2+ release was observed in only four of nine cells, was much smaller than that caused by agonist (Fig. 5 A), and was blocked by heparin (Fig. 5 B) to the extent that in five of five experiments with heparin no Ca2+ release from IS was observed. These findings confirm all aspects of the data reported by Thorn et al. (16Thorn P. Gerasimenko O. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (188)"

The transcription factor nuclear factor κ-B (NFκB) often mediates the effects of cytokines on target cells, but the identity of Rel family members important in human SMC activation remains uncertain. In vitro, human SMC express multiple Rel family members. Of these, dimers of p65 and p50, but not a putative SMC-Rel, comprise basal and inducible NFκB binding activities. SMC express two inhibitor proteins IκBβ and IκBα. Interleukin-1β stimulation caused transient loss of IκBα and a sustained decrease of IκBβ that correlated with increased and persistent levels of p65/p50 protein and binding activity in the nucleus. SMC cultured under serum-free conditions displayed little NFκB activity, but addition of serum or platelet-derived growth factor did activate NFκB. In situ analyses showed no evidence for basal NFκB activity in SMC in vivo as nonatherosclerotic arteries did not contain nuclear p65 or p50 protein. However, the nuclei of intimal SMC within human atheroma did contain both Rel proteins. We conclude that (i) dimers of p65 and p50, but not SMC-Rel, comprise NFκB complexes in human SMC; (ii) stimulatory components in serum activate NFκB and likely account for previously reported “constitutive” NFκB activity in cultured SMC; and (iii) exposure to inflammatory cytokines may produce prolonged NFκB activation in SMC because of sustained decreases in the inhibitory subunit IκB-β.

The nuclear factor κ-B (NFκB) family of transcription factors has emerged as a regulator of many of these molecules by vascular cells. Inflammatory cytokines, oxidized lipids, and oxidative stress, factors or events present in human atheroma, can activate NFκB in vitro and also elicit specific functions in SMC (1Raines, E. W., and Ross, R. (1993) Br. Heart. J., 69, Suppl. 1, S30–S37.Google Scholar, 4Nilsson J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Siebenlist U. Franzoso G.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar). Several genes up-regulated in SMC during atherogenesis, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and c-myc also contain functional κB elements in their promoter/enhancer regions (5Siebenlist U.

Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar). Moreover, SMC, macrophages, and endothelial cells within human atheroma exhibit nuclear localization of the NFκB subunit p65 (Rel A) in situ (8Brand K. Page S. Rogler G. Bartsch A. Brandl R. Knuechel R. Page M. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A. Neumeier D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Thus, in vitro and in situ studies underscore the potential importance of the NFκB pathway in dysfunction of vascular cells during atherogenesis. NFκB exists in the cytosol of many cell types as an inactive complex of Rel-related factors, bound to a member of inhibitor proteins termed IκB (reviewed in Refs. 5Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar and 7Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar). Rel family members include p65 (Rel A), Rel (c-Rel), Rel B, and the Drosophila homologdorsal, each of which contain transactivation domains necessary for gene induction. Other members, p50 (NFκB1) and p49 (NFκB2), are synthesized, respectively, as p105 and p100 precursors, and transactivate only weakly, but can form functional dimers with members of the first group. NFκB is sequestered in the cytosol in an inactive heteromeric complex by associating with one of several inhibitors denoted IκB, most commonly IκBα or IκBβ, or with Rel precursor proteins. Activation of NFκB follows phosphorylation of IκB or p105 on serine residues, possibly by a ubiquitin-regulated Ser/Thr kinase (9Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκB or p105 is enzymatically degraded or processed to p50, respectively, by the multicatalytic proteasome complex (10Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar), and liberated NFκB dimers then translocate to the nucleus and promote transactivation of target genes. One of these target genes encodes the inhibitor IκBα that binds to and thus limits further NFκB activity and gene expression (11deMartin M.R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 12Le B.O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). IκBβ, another IκB member, is not resynthesized following its degradation, and may mediate prolonged NFκB activity in lymphocytes exposed to lipopolysaccharide or IL-1 (13Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The diversity of dimeric complexes formed by Rel factors requires definition of the NFκB system in the context of each cell type examined. In endothelial cells, inducible expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules requires participation of a well characterized NFκB system (14Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Exp.

Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28913-28918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A novel, putative Rel protein termed “SMC-Rel” is thought to comprise constitutive NFκB activity in SMC and may permit cell division in serum-containing medium (16Lawrence R. Chang L.-J. Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28913-28918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bellas R.E. Lee J.S. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2521-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the repertoire of Rel proteins or their inhibitors expressed in SMC, the identity of NFκB members involved in DNA binding, or whether constitutive NFκB activity exists in human SMCin vivo has not been fully delineated. In view of the potential importance and unresolved issues regarding the role of NFκB in SMC, we have addressed the identity of Rel family members and the issue of their constitutive expression in vitro and in vivo in human SMC cultures and in normal and diseased arterial specimens. As the inhibitory limb of control of NFκB activity appears critical, we also tested the hypothesis that IκBα and IκBβ may play distinct roles in the control of cytokine activation of this cell type central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Rabbit affinity-purified polyclonal antisera to NFκB proteins p65, p50 (NFκB1), p49/52 (NFκB2), cRel, Rel B, IκBα/MAD-3, and IκBβ were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody HHF-35 (mouse IgG1) recognizing muscle-specific actin was purchased from Enzo Diagnostics (Sysosset, NY). Polyclonal rabbit neutralizing antibody to human PDGF-BB was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). A nonimmune rabbit IgG fraction was from Dako (Carpenteria, CA). Smooth muscle cells obtained from explanted sections of human saphenous veins were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 5 mml-glutamine, plus 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were passaged by brief trypsinization and were used through passage 5. The cells were characterized by phase contrast microscopy and were routinely screened for mycoplasma contamination by polymerase chain reaction using a commercially available kit (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH). Human aortic SMC and saphenous vein endothelial cells were isolated enzymatically and cultured as described previously (18Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared as described elsewhere (19Bourcier T. Dockter M. Hassid A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 644-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in 2 × SDS lysis buffer (1 × = 125 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Equivalent amounts of whole cell lysates (30–40 μg of protein) or nuclear or cytosolic fractions (prepared as described below) were resolved on 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels, followed by electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were incubated in PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20), containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at 37 °C, and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies used at 0.4 μg/ml, with the exception of IκB antisera, which was used at 0.5 μg/ml. Membranes were washed with PBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG as a secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA), diluted 1:15,000 in PBS-T, 5% dry milk. Immunocomplexes were visualized using Renaissance chemiluminescence reagents (DuPont NEN) and exposure to x-ray film. Saphenous vein SMC were grown to confluence (∼5 × 105 cells) in 10-cm Petri dishes in serum-containing medium. In some experiments, cells were preincubated 48 h in serum-free IT medium (Dulbecco' modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12, 1:1, insulin 5 μg/ml, transferrin 5 μg/ml) to reduce exposure to serum components before addition of stimuli (20Libby P. O'Brien K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with human recombinant cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, or PDGF-BB (Endogen, Cambridge, MA) for the indicated times, and were collected into chilled Microfuge tubes. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), with the additional step of washing nuclear pellets in low salt buffer prior to high salt extraction of nuclear proteins to remove any residual cytosolic contamination. Aliquots were assayed for protein concentration, dithiothreitol was added to a final 1 mmconcentration, and extracts were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the κB site of the murine immunoglobulin κ-light chain enhancer (AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC), mutant NFκB (AGTTGAGGcGACTTTCCCAGGC; substitution in lowercase), and GAS/ISRE (AAGTACTTTCAGTTTCATATTACTCTA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and purified by gel filtration through a 1.0-ml column of Bio-Gel P-6 polyacrylamide beads (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts (5–10 μg) were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl containing 32P-oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm), 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 5% glycerol. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, then at 4 °C for 10 min. In some experiments, increasing amounts of cold competitor oligonucleotides were added 5 min prior to addition of labeled probe. For supershift analysis, 2 μg of the indicated antibodies were incubated with nuclear extracts for 15 min prior to addition of labeled probe. Binding complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels via electrophoresis in 0.5 × Tris/borate/EDTA buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to film for 16–24 h. As a measure of NFκB activity, luciferase reporter constructs containing the thymidine kinase promoter (pTK) alone or downstream of three tandem NFκB binding sites (pκB-TK; AGCTTGGGACTTTCCATGGGACTTTCCTAGGGATTCCCC) were used. SMC were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were incubated 5 h in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Co-transfection with pRSV-β-Gal (0.2 μg) was used in all experiments to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. β-Gal activity was invariant with experimental treatments. After overnight recovery in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% serum, cells were incubated 48 h in serum-free IT medium or maintained in serum-containing medium. Cells were then stimulated with 10% serum, PDGF-BB, IL-1β, or vehicle (IT medium) and incubated for an additional 24 h. Experiments were terminated by two washes with ice-cold PBS and addition of 200 μl/well lysis buffer (100 mm KPO4, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Luciferase and galactosidase activities were measured in 20-μl aliquots over a period of 5 s using the Tropix detection system (Bedford, MA). Relative luciferase activity was calculated by dividing luciferase by β-Gal activity. For neutralization experiments, preparations of 10% FCS, 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB, or IT medium were incubated with or without 200 μg of PDGF-BB neutralizing antibody for 2 h at 37 °C prior to addition to cell cultures. Sections of human aortae and atherosclerotic carotid artery were obtained from transplantation donors and at endarterectomy, respectively. Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with graded steps of ethanol, then incubated with 2.5% normal goat serum in PBS. p65c and p50 polyclonal antisera or nonimmune rabbit IgG (1.5 μg/ml) diluted in 2.5% goat serum in PBS were added to sections for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, sections were layered with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) for 45 min. Complexes were detected with streptavidin-conjugated Texas Red or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Amersham Corp.). Some sections were counterstained for cell nuclei with 0.5 mg/ml bis-benzimide (H-33258) (Calbiochem) in PBS. Antibody specificity for immunostaining was assessed by immunocytofluorescent staining of TNF-α-stimulated human saphenous vein endothelial cells with p65c and p50 antisera, with or without prior absorption with a 100-fold excess corresponding cognate peptides. Fluorescence was observed using an Olympus BX60F microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd, Japan). Because of the unsettled nature of the identification of Rel subunits utilized by SMC we determined the spectrum of Rel family members expressed by saphenous vein SMC by immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates. SMC contained prominent levels of p65 (Rel-A) compared with c-Rel or Rel B, detected as weaker bands of similar size on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1). c-Rel and Rel B in SMC comigrated with c-Rel and Rel B in Jurkat cell lysates and were abolished by preincubation of antisera with the corresponding cognate peptides (data not shown). Antisera to p50 (NFκB1) recognized a ∼50-kDa protein, whereas antisera to p49 (NFκB2) recognized a single 100-kDa protein, suggesting that cultured SMC expressed p49 mostly as the unprocessed precursor p100. Human aortic SMC exhibited a similar profile of Rel protein expression, indicating similar expression of Rel proteins by SMC cultured from differing human vascular beds. Previous studies reported that cultured bovine SMC exhibit constitutive NFκB binding activity composed of p50 complexed with a putative Rel protein termed SMC-Rel (16Lawrence R. Chang L.-J. Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28913-28918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the Rel proteins in human SMC that participate in binding DNA under basal and cytokine-stimulated conditions, nuclear extracts were prepared from saphenous vein or aortic SMC following 2 h of incubation with or without IL-1β, a potent stimulus of NFκB activation. As the NFκB proteins involved in DNA binding have been identified in human endothelial cells (14Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), for comparison nuclear extracts were prepared from saphenous vein endothelial cells treated with or without TNF-α. Both venous and aortic SMC expressed two bands of specific DNA-binding complexes under unstimulated conditions, referred to as complexes I and II (Fig. 2 a). Stimulation with IL-1β for 2 h markedly increased binding of complex I and slightly increased binding of complex II. Inclusion of polymyxin B (50 μg/ml) in the experiments did not inhibit binding activity, arguing against activation of NFκB by lipopolysaccharide contaminants (data not shown). In comparison to SMC, unstimulated endothelial cells showed little to no complex I and low levels of complex II, and binding activity was readily induced by stimulation with TNF-α. Of note, complexes I and II in SMC and EC comigrated in nondenaturing gels, suggesting a similar subunit composition. Unlabeled wild type NFκB probe inhibited binding activity to a much greater extent than mutant NFκB or GAS/ISRE probe, indicating the specificity of the DNA-binding complexes for NFκB motifs (Fig. 2 b). A third, faster migrating complex (NS) likely represents a low affinity protein interaction with the NFκB probe used in these experiments as indicated by 1) lack of regulation by cytokine stimulation, 2) less competition or a smearing of the complex by cold competitor oligonucleotide, and 3) no interaction with recombinant IκBα added to the binding reaction (data not shown). The subunit composition of basal and cytokine-induced DNA-binding complexes in human SMC was ascertained by supershifting with a panel of antisera to Rel family members (Figs. 3, a andb). Complex I in both unstimulated and IL-1β-stimulated cells interacted with two different antisera to the carboxyl or amino terminus of p65 (p65c and p65a, respectively), and with antisera to p50. Complex II interacted only with antisera to p50. Moreover, addition of both p65 and p50 antisera abolished all binding activity in nuclear extracts from unstimulated SMC. Antisera to p49, c-Rel, Rel B, or nonimmune rabbit IgG did not affect either complexes I or II. Thus, in cultured human SMC, complex I likely contains heterodimers of p65 and p50, and complex II likely contains homodimers of p50. Human endothelial cells stimulated with TNF-α have identical subunit composition (14Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) (data not shown). NFκB signaling in cell types such as lymphocytes and macrophages is self-limited due to postinduction synthesis of the NFκB inhibitor IκBα (7Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar); however, such an autoregulatory system has not been identified in SMC. To characterize further NFκB signaling in human SMC, the fate of inhibitor proteins IκBα and IκBβ was followed over time in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from SMC stimulated with IL-1β or TNF-α. IκBα occurs as a ∼37-kDa protein in the cytosol of unstimulated SMC (Fig.4). IκBα rapidly (≤0.5 h), yet transiently disappeared following stimulation with IL-1β or TNF-α, and returned to detectable levels at 2 h. The nuclear fraction contained no IκBα up to 24 h after cytokine stimulation, indicating that the disappearance of IκBα from the cytosol resulted from proteolysis rather than translocation to the nucleus. Inhibition of IL-1β- or TNF-α-induced depletion of IκBα by MG132, a potent inhibitor of proteasome activity, confirmed this interpretation (data not shown) (22Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). IκBβ occurs as a ∼46-kDa protein in unstimulated SMC. Two hours following treatment with IL-1β, levels of IκBβ markedly decreased, but remained detectable. In contrast to IκBα, levels of IκBβ remained low throughout the period of treatment with IL-1β. By comparison, TNF-α affected levels of IκBβ little for up to 24 h (Fig. 4). Loss of cytosolic IκBα correlated temporally with induction of NFκB binding activity in nuclear extracts from SMC cultured in parallel. Interestingly, the duration of increased NFκB activity correlated inversely with levels of IκBβ protein. Loss of cytoplasmic IκBβ in response to IL-1β associated with NFκB-DNA binding activity that persisted for 24 h. TNF-α stimulation, which affected IκBβ levels little, induced transient NFκB-DNA binding activity that peaked by 1 h and declined to near basal levels by 6 h (Fig. 4). Consistent with the loss of IκB inhibitor proteins and increased NFκB binding activity, nuclear fractions contained increased amounts of p65 and p50 protein following IL-1β stimulation, determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5). Increased levels of nuclear p65/p50 persisted for 24 h compared to unstimulated SMC, consistent with sustained NFκB binding activity observed during this time (Fig. 4). Nuclear extracts from unstimulated SMC contained low amounts of both p65 and p50, consistent with basal levels of DNA binding activity (Figs. 2 and 3). Levels of cytosolic p65 and p50 did not change appreciably during the experiments, suggesting that a small fraction of the total pool of these NFκB dimers translocated to the nucleus in response to cytokine stimulation. In striking contrast to the changes in p65 and p50, c-Rel remained cytosolic, and no nuclear accumulation of c-Rel was observed in response to IL-1β, indicating selectivity in mobilization of Rel dimers in human SMC. The above experiments examined NFκB family members in smooth muscle cells cultured in serum-containing medium. Since serum may contain or induce production of factors that can activate NFκB, experiments were performed in SMC cultured in a defined serum-free medium (IT medium). Removal of serum for 48 h strikingly decreased both basal NFκB-DNA binding as well as luciferase activity from a heterologous promoter construct containing three tandem repeat NFκB-binding elements (Fig. 6, a andb). Reintroduction of serum (10%) restored NFκB binding and luciferase activity to “basal” levels, which persisted for at least 24 h. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a serum-associated mitogen also expressed in human atheroma, alters many functions of SMC relevant in atherogenesis. PDGF-BB increased NFκB-DNA binding and luciferase activity in IT-cultured SMC, but did not further increase basal levels of NFκB-DNA binding in SMC maintained in serum (Figs. 6, a and b). A neutralizing PDGF antibody abolished the stimulatory effect of PDGF-BB on κB-dependent luciferase activity but failed to block the stimulatory effect of 10% serum (Fig. 6 c), indicating that factors other than PDGF contribute to constitutive NFκB activity present in SMC cultured in serum. Human SMC responded similarly to IL-1β either in serum-free or serum-containing medium. Thus, “constitutive” NFκB activity in cultured human SMC likely results from the presence of serum constituents or, perhaps, the proliferative status of the cell population. In the normal vessel wall, SMC do not encounter mitogens or certain other constituents of serum, an unphysiologic fluid. We therefore tested whether SMC in the normal artery wall exhibit activation of NFκB. To this end, we examined sections of aortae obtained from transplantation donors for the localization of p65 and p50 by indirect immunofluorescence. Staining with rabbit polyclonal antisera to p65 or p50 (red fluorescence) and counterstaining with bis-benzimide to visualize nuclei (blue fluorescence) yielded diffuse red cytoplasmic staining around blue nuclei of medial SMC (Fig.7 a). Staining with nonimmune rabbit IgG yielded no signal. A filter that allowed single transmission of red fluorescence revealed dark, nonfluorescent nuclei surrounded by red fluorescence, indicating no nuclear staining with either p65 or p50 antisera. In contrast, sections of human atheroma obtained at carotid endarterectomy showed cells with clear nuclear red fluorescence when stained with anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies. Co-staining with α-actin antibodies (HHF-35) identified these cells as smooth muscle (green-yellow color). Specificity of p65c and p50 antisera was assessed in TNF-α-stimulated human saphenous vein endothelial cells, as the identity of Rel subunits mobilized by TNF-α in this cell type is established (14Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent staining with p65c and p50 antisera yielded diffuse cytoplasmic but little nuclear fluorescence. Stimulation with TNF-α for 1 h yielded intense nuclear fluorescence for p65 and increased nuclear fluorescence for p50, indicative of nuclear translocation of these Rel subunits. Preabsorption of antisera with a 100-fold excess of corresponding cognate peptide abolished fluorescence of TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells (Fig. 7 b). Thus, in medial SMC of the normal vessel wall, NFκB proteins p65 and p50 are restricted to the cytosol, in contrast to SMC cultured in serum or in atherosclerotic lesions. This study investigated the role of the NFκB signaling system in the regulation of functions of human SMC of importance in human atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that SMC in culture express basal, constitutive NFκB activity (16Lawrence R. Chang L.-J. Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28913-28918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Shin W.S. Hong Y.-H. Peng H.-B De Caterina R. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11317-11324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Prior to this, only lymphocyte cell lines and neurons were known to exhibit constitutive NFκB activity (24Lernbecher T. Kistler B. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Dobrzanski P. Ryseck R.P Bravo R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Kaltschmidt C.

Curiously, the Rel proteins that comprise this basal activity differ in each cell type. In lymphocytes and neurons, the basal complexes contain Rel-B heterodimers and p65/p50 dimers, respectively. In SMC, the basal complexes are thought to contain p50 and a putative Rel protein t"

PLA2s generate rate-limiting precursors in the biosynthesis of various types of biologically active lipids, including prostaglandins, hydroxy fatty acids, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and platelet-activating factor. Over the last two decades, two major classes of mammalian PLA2s (intracellular and secretory) have been characterized and cloned. Secretory PLA2s were first characterized and then classified into different groups according to their molecular structure and the localization of their disulfide bridges (4Heinrikson R.L.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). sPLA2s have been purified from a variety of sources including not only mammalian pancreas, spleen, lung, platelets, and extracellular fluids, but also insect and snake venoms (1Dennis E.A.

Pancreatic sPLA2, nonpancreatic inflammatory sPLA2, bee venom sPLA2, and a novel sPLA2 highly expressed in heart, are prototypes of group I, II, III, and V, respectively (2Dennis E.A. Trends Biol.

The pancreatic group I sPLA2, as its name indicates, was originally purified from pancreatic juice and then identified and cloned in other tissues, such as lung, spleen, kidney, and ovary (3Kudo I.

Besides its primary function in digestion of dietary lipids, the pancreatic group I sPLA2 has been proposed to play a role in cell proliferation (21Arita H. Hanasaki K. Nakano T. Oka S. Teraoka H.

The inflammatory group II sPLA2(initially called nonpancreatic sPLA2) has been purified and cloned from various sources, including platelets and extracellular fluids (16Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K.

The human group V sPLA2 has been cloned from brain and is found strongly expressed in heart (36Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol.

Acta. 1994; 1215: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). More recently, this sPLA2 has been detected in P388D1 murine macrophages where it may act as a novel sPLA2 effector involved in lipid mediators production (38Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A fourth sPLA2 has been cloned in rat and mouse (39Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but appears to be a nonfunctional pseudogene in humans (40Tischfield J.A.

This sPLA2 belongs to group IIC and is prevalently expressed in testis. Other low molecular mass PLA2s have been characterized from various tissues including spermatozoa, brain, and lung, suggesting a larger diversity of PLA2s (41Langlais J. Chafouleas J.G. Ingraham R.

Moreover, a sPLA2-related gene has been cloned from human teratocarcinoma cells and found to code for a protein of 689 amino acids containing two domains of high homology with sPLA2s (45Feuchter-Murthy A.E. Freeman J.D. Mager D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A wealth of sPLA2s have also been described in snake and insect venoms. Besides a role in prey digestion, several venom sPLA2s are potent toxins that display neurotoxicity and myotoxicity among a variety of other toxic effects (17Kini R.M. Evans H.J. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 46Gutierrez J.M. Lomonte B. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 1405-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 47Hawgood B. Bon C. Handb. Nat. Toxins. 1991; 5: 3-52Google Scholar). Studies with several iodinated venom sPLA2s, including OS1 and OS2 purified from Taipan snake venom, have shown the existence of various high affinity sPLA2receptors (48Lambeau G. Cupillard L. Lazdunski M. Kini R.M. Venom Phospholipase A2 Enzymes: Structure, Function and Mechanism. Wiley & Sons, Chichester, England1997: 389-412Google Scholar). N-type sPLA2 receptors were first identified in rat brain membranes and are made up of several protein subunits of 36–51 kDa and 85 kDa (49Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors display a high affinity for neurotoxic sPLA2s, but not for nontoxic sPLA2s, suggesting that N-type receptors may contribute to sPLA2 neurotoxic effects (49Lambeau G. Barhanin J.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They consist of a single 180-kDa subunit and bind a number of toxic and nontoxic venom sPLA2s. The M-type sPLA2receptor has now been cloned in various species (53Ancian P. Lambeau G. Mattei M.-G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Although the physiological roles of M- and N-type receptors remain to be discovered, M-type receptors from various species have been shown to associate with high affinity pancreatic group I sPLA2s as well as inflammatory group II sPLA2s withK d values of 1–10 nm, suggesting that mammalian endogenous sPLA2s might be the natural ligands of these receptors (21Arita H.

We now report the cloning, chromosomal mapping, and recombinant expression of a novel human sPLA2. Based on its structural properties, this sPLA2 appears as a first member of a new group of mammalian sPLA2s, called group X, according to the PLA2 nomenclature defined recently (2Dennis E.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Protein sequences of different sPLA2s were used to search for homologues in gene data bases stored at the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) by using the tBLASTn sequence alignment program (62Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68348) Google Scholar). Translation of an EST sequence (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clone identification 309343, 3′, GenBankTM accession no.N93958) (63Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) in one frame presented a significant sequence similarity (p = 9.9 e −21) with several sPLA2s. This 445-bp sequence was originally obtained from a human fetal lung cDNA library. A 327-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the EST sequence was then amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using human fetal lung cDNA. For that purpose, poly(A)+mRNA (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) was reverse-transcribed with the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and used for PCR with a sense primer (5′-GGAATTCGCCTATATGAAATATGGT-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-GGAATTCAAGGTAGTCAGTCACACTTG-3′) containing EcoRI restriction sites. PCR reactions were performed using a low error rate DNA polymerase (PWO polymerase, Eurogentec Corp., Belgium) in a total volume of 50 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.85, 25 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 200 μm of each primer, 20 ng of cDNA template, and 1 unit of PWO DNA polymerase. PCR conditions were: 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 30 s, and 72 °C, 30 s, for 33 cycles. The 327-bp DNA fragment was then subcloned into pBlueScript (Stratagene Cloning Systems) and sequenced to verify its identity with the EST sequence by using an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373A) with the dideoxy nucleotide method. In situ hybridization was performed on chromosome preparations obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes cultured for 72 h. 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (60 μg/ml) was added for the final 7 h of culture to ensure a posthybridization chromosomal banding of good quality. The 5′ Alu repeat element was removed from the full-length hGX sPLA2cDNA clone by restriction with ApoI, and the resulting DNA fragment (nucleotides −370 to 580, see Fig. 1) inserted into pBlueScript was tritium-labeled by nick-translation to a specific activity of 108 dpm/μg. The radiolabeled probe was hybridized to metaphase spreads at a final concentration of 200 ng/ml of hybridization solution as described previously (64Mattei M.G. Philip N. Passage E. Moisan J.P. Mandel J.L. Mattei J.F. Hum. Genet. 1985; 69: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). After coating with nuclear track emulsion (Kodak NTB2), slides were exposed for 20 days at 4 °C and then developed. To avoid any slipping of silver grains during the banding procedure, chromosome spreads were first stained with buffered Giemsa solution and metaphase-photographed. R-banding was then performed by the fluorochrome-photolysis-Giemsa method, and metaphases were rephotographed before analysis.Figure 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of hGX sPLA2. The predicted prepropeptide segment isboxed and possible initiator methionines are shown inbold. The arginine doublet preceding the mature protein is indicated by squares. The putative Asn-glycosylation site is marked with a triangle. The putative polyadenylation signal is underlined and shown in bold. The original EST sequence (I.M.A.G.E.

Blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC (30 mm NaCl, 3 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7.0) with 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films with two intensifying screens. Northern blots were then stripped and hybridized in the same conditions as above with the entire coding sequences of the human group V sPLA2 (36Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the human group II sPLA2 (25Kramer R.M. Hession C. Johansen B. Hayes G. McGray P. Chow E.P. Tizard R. Pepinsky R.B. J.

Y. ). 1986; 5: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and finally with the manufacturer-supplied β-actin probe. The full-length 1020-bp cDNA clone coding for hGX sPLA2 was subcloned directly into the expression vector pcDNA I (Invitrogen Corp.) by using convenient restriction enzyme sites. hGX sPLA2 clones Met-42 and Met-32 were prepared by a PCR-assisted strategy using a low error rate PWO DNA polymerase (Eurogentec Corp., Belgium) and respective sense oligonucleotides primers (Met-42, 5′-GGAATTCGCGGCCGCCATGGGGCCGCTACCTGTGT-3′; Met-32, 5′-GGAATTCGCGGCCGCCATGCTGCTCCTGCTACTGC-3′) in combination with a common antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GTCTAGAGTCAGTCACACTTGGGCGAGT-3′). Primers contained restriction sites to facilitate subcloning of the PCR fragments and consensus Kozak sequences were added to the sense primers to enhance protein expression (65Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). The PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA I and sequenced to verify the integrity of DNA constructions. The various plasmids were then transfected into COS or HEK 293 cells by a modification of the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (66Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) or by the Ca/PO4procedure (67Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar), respectively. Cells at 50% confluence were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA/75-cm2 Petri dish. Cell supernatants were harvested at different times post transfection and assayed for hGX sPLA2 activity. On day 3, washed cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in 300 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to measure cell-associated sPLA2 activity. To test whether hGX sPLA2 is secreted as a proenzyme, serum-free cell supernatants containing hGX sPLA2 activity were treated with 3 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma, T-1005 type XI from bovine brain) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2 for 3 h at 37 °C and then assayed for sPLA2 activity with [3H]oleate-labeled Escherichia colimembranes. Preparation of autoclaved E. coli membranes and sPLA2 assays were performed essentially as described previously (57Ancian P. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13146-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, sPLA2 assays were performed at 25 °C in a total volume of 100 μl consisting of 140 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 100,000 dpm of [3H]oleate-labeled E. coli membranes. Incubation times and sample volumes were adjusted to ensure hydrolysis rates within the linear range of enzymatic assays. Typically, 3–10 μl of solution containing hGX sPLA2 were incubated for 30–60 min at 20 °C to measure sPLA2 activity. Reaction mixtures were stopped by adding 300 μl of 0.1 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min, 300 μl of supernatant containing hydrolyzed phospholipids were counted. Control incubations in the absence of added sPLA2 were carried out in parallel and used to calculate specific hydrolysis. Liposomes were prepared by sonication using different phospholipid mixtures (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylserine, withd-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 75:25 mol%).d-α-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is a nonhydrolyzable phospholipid that is used for formation of liposomes with the various hydrolyzable phospholipids. l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (from egg yolk), l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (from egg yolk),l-α-phosphatidylserine (from bovine brain), andd-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine were purchased from Sigma. Phospholipids were dissolved in chloroform, dried under a nitrogen stream, and resuspended at 0.33 mm in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The lipid suspension was then sonicated twice for 2 min with a 20-kHz MSE tip probe at 100 W. Incubations were carried out for 15 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 500 μl containing 200 nmol of hydrolyzable phospholipids resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmCaCl2, and 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA. hGX sPLA2activity was measured by adding 20 μl of a 72-h COS cell supernatant, and incubation was carried out for 15 min at 37 °C. Released fatty acids were extracted by a modification of Dole's procedure (68Tsujishita Y. Asaoka Y. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6274-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), methylated with diazomethane, and quantified as described below by GC-MS measurements. Control incubations in the absence of added sPLA2 were carried out in parallel and used to calculate specific hydrolysis. Human erythrocytes were isolated from fresh citrated blood by the procedure of Steck et al. (69Steck T.L. Weinstein S. Strauss J.H. Wallach D.F.H. Science. 1970; 168: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 100 ×g. Red blood cells were then collected, washed several times with 5 volumes of an ice-cold phosphate saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0), and hemolyzed in 40 volumes of 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. Erythrocyte ghosts were collected by centrifugation for 20 min at 22,000 × g and washed several times with 5 mm phosphate buffer until “white ghosts” were obtained. sPLA2 assays were performed in a total volume of 500 μl containing erythrocyte membranes (representing 200 nmol of hydrolyzable phospholipids) resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Incubations were carried out for 15 min at 37 °C with translational shaking. 20 μl of a 72-h COS cell supernatant were used to measure hGX sPLA2 activity. The released fatty acids were extracted by a modification of the Dole's procedure (68Tsujishita Y. Asaoka Y. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2122749282,"Copper is an essential micronutrient that is toxic in excess. To maintain an adequate yet non-toxic concentration of copper, cells possess several modes of control. One involves copper uptake mediated by genes encoding proteins that play key roles in high affinity copper transport. These include the FRE1-encoded Cu2+/Fe3+ reductase and the CTR1and CTR3-encoded membrane-associated copper transport proteins. Each of these genes is transcriptionally regulated as a function of copper availability: repressed when cells are grown in the presence of copper and highly activated during copper starvation. Our data demonstrate that repression of CTR3 transcription is exquisitely copper-sensitive and specific. Although copper repressesCTR3 gene expression at picomolar metal concentrations, cadmium and mercury down-regulate CTR3 expression only at concentrations 3 orders magnitude greater. Furthermore, copper-starvation rapidly and potently induces CTR3 gene expression. We demonstrate that the CTR1, CTR3, and FRE1 genes involved in high affinity copper uptake share a common promoter element, TTTGCTC, which is necessary for both copper repression and copper-starvation activation of gene expression. Furthermore, the Mac1p is essential for down- or up-regulation of the copper-transport genes. In vivo footprinting studies reveal that the cis-acting element, termed CuRE (copper-response element), is occupied under copper-starvation and accessible to DNA modifying agents in response to copper repression, and that this regulated occupancy requires a functional MAC1 gene. Therefore, yeast cells coordinately express genes involved in high affinity copper transport through the action of a common signaling pathway. Copper is an essential micronutrient that is toxic in excess. To maintain an adequate yet non-toxic concentration of copper, cells possess several modes of control. One involves copper uptake mediated by genes encoding proteins that play key roles in high affinity copper transport. These include the FRE1-encoded Cu2+/Fe3+ reductase and the CTR1and CTR3-encoded membrane-associated copper transport proteins. Each of these genes is transcriptionally regulated as a function of copper availability: repressed when cells are grown in the presence of copper and highly activated during copper starvation. Our data demonstrate that repression of CTR3 transcription is exquisitely copper-sensitive and specific. Although copper repressesCTR3 gene expression at picomolar metal concentrations, cadmium and mercury down-regulate CTR3 expression only at concentrations 3 orders magnitude greater. Furthermore, copper-starvation rapidly and potently induces CTR3 gene expression. We demonstrate that the CTR1, CTR3, and FRE1 genes involved in high affinity copper uptake share a common promoter element, TTTGCTC, which is necessary for both copper repression and copper-starvation activation of gene expression. Furthermore, the Mac1p is essential for down- or up-regulation of the copper-transport genes.

Therefore, yeast cells coordinately express genes involved in high affinity copper transport through the action of a common signaling pathway. Copper is an essential trace element that is required for a number of cellular enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, lysyl oxidase, and dopamine-β-monooxygenase (1Linder M.C.

Therefore, all organisms must be able to sense both toxic and nutritional levels of copper to allow sufficient copper to accumulate to drive biochemical reactions, yet prevent the accumulation to toxic levels.

The binding of Cu(I) to Ace1p or Amt1p to form a tetra-copper cluster activates their DNA-binding domains via a conformational change, thereby providing a direct link between the toxic copper sensor and the activation of detoxification genes (22Fürst P.

Indeed, cells that are defective in high affinity copper transport exhibit a number of phenotypes which can be corrected by exogenous copper that include respiratory deficiency, sensitivity to superoxide generating agents due to a defect in Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase activity, and severely diminished iron accumulation due to a defective copper-dependent ferroxidase (Fet3) required for high affinity iron transport (28Askwith C.

Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). As would be expected, the genes encoding proteins involved in high affinity copper or iron transport are repressed, at the level of steady-state mRNA, by low concentrations of their respective metals and induced by copper or iron starvation, respectively (10Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, consistent with the involvement of the FRE1-encoded Cu(II)-Fe(III) reductase in both high affinity copper and iron transport, the expression of this gene is repressed by both copper and iron (24Dancis A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Insight into the mechanism for iron-dependent transcriptional repression in yeast has been gained by the recent identification and analysis of the iron-responsive DNA-binding protein Aft1 (30Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), which binds to the consensus sequence PyPuCACCCPu found in the promoters of theFET3, FTR1, FTH1, CCC2,FRE1, and FRE2 genes (31Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).Currently, it is unclear how yeast cells sense very low concentrations of copper and respond by repressing the expression of theFRE1, CTR1, and CTR3 genes. One protein implicated in this signaling pathway, Mac1, was discovered based on significant homology to the amino-terminal 40 amino acid residues of the copper-activated DNA-binding domains of the Ace1 and Amt1 proteins (32Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mac1Δ cells exhibit phenotypes consistent with defective copper transport including respiratory deficiency, defective Cu(II) and Fe(III) reductase activity, impaired regulation of FRE1transcription, hypersensitivity to a variety of stresses including metal and oxidative stress, and poor growth on rich medium (25Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 32Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a dominant mutation in a duplicated region rich in cysteine exhibits high levels of Cu(II) reductase activity andFRE1 mRNA that are virtually not repressed by copper (25Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These characteristics of Mac1p, as well as the nuclear localization of a Mac1-β-galactosidase fusion protein (32Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), suggests that Mac1 plays a key role in copper homeostasis.In this report, we demonstrate that the regulation of FRE1,CTR1, and CTR3 transcription is exquisitely copper-sensitive and specific. We demonstrate that these three genes share a common promoter element, TTTGCTC, which is necessary for both copper repression and copper-starvation activation of expression. Furthermore, the Mac1p is essential for down- or up-regulation of the copper transport genes. In vivo footprinting studies reveal that the cis-acting element, termed CuRE (copper-response element), is occupied under copper-starvation and accessible to DNA modifying agents in response to copper repression, and that this copper-responsive occupation of the CuREs requires a functionalMAC1 gene. Taken together these results show that yeast cells coordinately express genes involved in high affinity copper transport through the action of a common signaling pathway to acquire this micronutrient from the environment.DISCUSSIONBecause of its essential yet toxic nature, all cells must maintain tight homeostatic regulation of the levels of bioavailable copper. Regulatory responses to copper include the activation or repression of gene transcription, copper-modulated turnover of proteins that transport or utilize copper, and alterations in the intracellular trafficking of copper transporting ATPases in response to fluctuations in copper concentrations (9Thiele D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this report, we have characterized the molecular mechanisms responsible for the copper-responsive regulation of CTR3, CTR1, andFRE1 genes that play a critical role in high affinity copper transport in yeast. Detailed studies of CTR3 gene regulation have revealed that half-maximal repression of CTR3 mRNA levels occurs in the presence of as little as 2.0 × 10−11m CuSO4 or 1.4 × 10−11m AgNO3 (Fig. 1). This represents an exquisitely sensitive and selective metal responsive system since at least 1000-fold higher concentrations of cadmium or mercury were required to achieve the same level of repression and no other metal tested was able to repress CTR3 mRNA levels. Since repression is observed with cadmium and mercury, however, we cannot at present eliminate the possibilities that either trace levels of copper, undetectable by atomic absorption, were present in our stock solutions or that there are significant differences in the efficiency with which copper and silver, versus cadmium and mercury, are transported or distributed in yeast cells. The similarity in the potency of silver in fostering the repression of CTR3mRNA levels resembles previous results on the Ace1 and Amt1 copper MRTFs, which are known to form tetragonal coordinates with Cu(I) via cysteine thiolates (23Graden J.A. Posewitz M.C. Simon J.R. George G.N. Pickering I.J. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14583-14589Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The electronic similarity of Ag(I) to Cu(I), but not Cu(II), suggests that the copper sensing machinery involved in the repression of yeast copper transport genes may sense Cu(I), rather than Cu(II).Our studies have identified strictly conserved repeated CuREs present in two copies in each of the CTR1, CTR3, andFRE1 promoters. Inspection of the CTR1 promoter suggests the presence of a third CuRE, located between positions −529 and −523, however, the contribution of this element to copper-responsive regulation of CTR1 has not yet been determined. Since single or multiple point mutations within the CuREs abolish both copper-dependent repression and copper-starvation-induced expression of CTR1,CTR3, and FRE1, this suggests that yeast cells utilize a common mechanism to coordinately regulate the expression of the copper transport machinery. Examination of the CuRE sequences inCTR1, CTR3, and FRE1, suggest a consensus sequence WWWTTTGCTCR (W = A or T; R = purine). The CuRE sequence bears an interesting sequence similarity to the binding sites for the Ace1 and Amt1 copper MRTFs (HTHXXGCTG, H = A, C or T; X = any residue), however, the inability to convert a CuRE to an Ace1p activation site by substituting the terminal C residue for a G (Fig. 4, plasmid derivative M4) suggests that other nucleotides within or flanking the CuRE confer specificity for copper repression and copper-starvation induction of gene expression which is independent of Ace1p (10Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2Although the center-to-center distances between the CuREs, for each of the CTR1, CTR3, and FRE1 promoters predict that they lie on opposite faces of the DNA, it is currently unknown whether this geometry plays a role in the regulation of copper transporter gene expression via the CuREs. The FRE1 promoter fragment, which has the shortest distance between the two CuREs, gave rise to the poorest repression by copper and the strongest activation by copper-starvation. Since this promoter fragment lacks binding sites for the Aft1 iron-responsive regulatory protein (31Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), this supports the notion that de-repression of the FRE1-CYC1-lacZ fusion gene represents a response to copper starvation rather than an indirect response to iron starvation. However, whether other promoter elements contribute to the magnitude of these regulatory responses must await a comprehensive dissection of each of the promoters of these genes encoding proteins that function in high affinity copper transport.It is currently unknown how such exquisitely low extracellular copper concentrations are capable of signaling the repression ofCTR1, CTR3, and FRE1 gene expression. Based on previous observations that S. cerevisiae cells harboring a deletion of the MAC1 gene display pleiotropic defects that are corrected by the addition of copper, and are defective in the regulation of FRE1 transcription (25Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 32Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that MAC1 plays a role in the regulation of all the genes known to be involved in high affinity copper transport in yeast. Indeed, we have demonstrated that cells bearing a disruption of the MAC1 gene are severely defective in the expression and regulation of mRNA levels from each of these genes (Fig. 6). Furthermore, isogenic cells harboring a dominant allele ofMAC1, in which a His residue in the first Cys-rich carboxyl-terminal cluster repeat has been altered to Gln, fail to respond to copper administration to repress CTR1,CTR3, or FRE1 mRNA levels. Although Mac1p exhibits significant sequence similarity to the amino-terminal 40 amino acids of Ace1p and Amt1p, and a Mac1-β-galactosidase fusion protein has been localized to the yeast cell nucleus (32Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we have been unable to demonstrate specific CuRE binding activity for Mac1p either expressed in E. coli cells or produced by in vitro transcription and translation (data not shown). Therefore, Mac1p may function in the copper-signaling pathway to regulate copper transport gene expression through a number of potential mechanisms. First, Mac1p may require specific post-translational modifications or partner proteins for sequence-specific DNA binding that would not be present through expression in heterologous systems. Alternatively, Mac1p could be required for the synthesis or activity of another protein(s) which directly interacts with CuREs, or Mac1p may play a critical nuclear signaling role for copper that is upstream of a direct DNA binding activity. Consistent with all of these models, electrophoretic mobility shift experiments using extracts from yeast cells expressing a functional epitope-tagged MAC1 allele have revealed the presence of a specific CuRE-protein complex from control or BCS-treated cells which is absent in extracts from cells treated with 10 nm CuSO4 (data not shown). Furthermore, the formation of this CuRE-protein specific complex was dependent on the presence of a functional MAC1 gene, and the complex was not abolished by the addition of copper to a strain bearing a MAC1 up1 allele. On the other hand, the inability of the anti-epitope monoclonal antibody to supershift this complex leaves open the possibility that Mac1p may not directly contact DNA sequences within the CuRE. Our in vivo footprinting studies clearly demonstrate that in the wild type MAC1 strains theCTR3 CuREs are occupied under conditions of activeCTR3 gene expression (i.e. copper-starvation), and are highly accessible to dimethyl sulfate modification under conditions in which CTR3 gene expression is repressed (i.e. addition of 10 nm CuSO4). In contrast, mac1Δ mutants give rise to constitutive dimethyl sulfate modifications in the CTR3 promoter region encompassing the CuREs that resemble the repressed state in the wild type strain. Furthermore, MAC1 up1 mutants, which constitutively express the copper transport genes and are unresponsive to copper for repression, give rise to constitutive protection from dimethyl sulfate modification within and flanking the CTR3CuREs. Taken together these results demonstrate that Mac1p is an essential component of the copper-signaling pathway that directly or indirectly modulates coordinated copper-responsive gene expression of yeast high affinity copper transport genes through the CuREs. Copper is an essential trace element that is required for a number of cellular enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, lysyl oxidase, and dopamine-β-monooxygenase (1Linder M.C. Hazegh-Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: 797S-811SPubMed Google Scholar). Copper also plays a critical role in the assimilation of iron both in microbial and mammalian systems (2Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol.

However, when allowed to accumulate in excess, copper is highly toxic due to its proclivity to engage in redox reactions which result in the formation of hydroxyl radical, a reactive species that causes extensive damage to nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar, 5Santoro N. Thiele D.J. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. R. G.

https://openalex.org/W2094239593,"Intracellular levels of active steroid hormones are determined by their relative rates of synthesis and breakdown. In the case of the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone, synthesis from the precursor testosterone is mediated by steroid 5α-reductase, whereas breakdown to the inactive androgens 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-adiol), and androsterone is mediated by reductive 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3α-HSD) and oxidative 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSD), respectively. We report the isolation by expression cloning of a cDNA encoding a 17β-HSD6 isozyme that oxidizes 3α-adiol to androsterone. 17β-HSD6 is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family and shares 65% sequence identity with retinol dehydrogenase 1 (RoDH1), which catalyzes the oxidation of retinol to retinal. Expression of rat and human RoDH cDNAs in mammalian cells is associated with the oxidative conversion of 3α-adiol to dihydrotestosterone. Thus, 17β-HSD6 and RoDH play opposing roles in androgen action; 17β-HSD6 inactivates 3α-adiol by conversion to androsterone and RoDH activates 3α-adiol by conversion to dihydrotestosterone. The synthesis of an active steroid hormone by back conversion of an inactive metabolite represents a potentially important mechanism by which the steady state level of a transcriptional effector can be regulated.

The synthesis of an active steroid hormone by back conversion of an inactive metabolite represents a potentially important mechanism by which the steady state level of a transcriptional effector can be regulated. The formation and growth of the prostate as well as other male reproductive organs is dependent on androgens, a class of C19 steroids that act through the androgen receptor to regulate gene expression. The two predominant androgens in this regard are testosterone, 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: testosterone, 4-androsten-17β-ol-3-one; 3α-adiol, 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol; 3β-adiol, 5α-androstan-3β,17β-diol; androstanedione, 5α-androstan-3,17-dione; androstenedione, 4-androsten-3,17-dione; androsterone, 5α-androstan-3α-ol-17-one; 17β-HSD6, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 6; 3α-HSD, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; RoDH, retinol dehydrogenase; dihydrotestosterone, 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one; nt, nucleotide(s); kb, kilobase(s); cis-RA, cis-retoinic acid. 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: testosterone, 4-androsten-17β-ol-3-one; 3α-adiol, 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol; 3β-adiol, 5α-androstan-3β,17β-diol; androstanedione, 5α-androstan-3,17-dione; androstenedione, 4-androsten-3,17-dione; androsterone, 5α-androstan-3α-ol-17-one; 17β-HSD6, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 6; 3α-HSD, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; RoDH, retinol dehydrogenase; dihydrotestosterone, 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one; nt, nucleotide(s); kb, kilobase(s); cis-RA, cis-retoinic acid. which is formed in the testis from androstenedione by the action of a reductive 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD3) enzyme (1Geissler W.M. Davis D.L. Wu L. Bradshaw K.D. Patel S. Mendonca B.B. Elliston K.O. Wilson J.D. Russell D.W. Andersson S. Nature Genet. 1994; 7: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and dihydrotestosterone, which is formed from testosterone by steroid 5α-reductase isozymes and is the active androgen in the prostate (2Russell D.W. Wilson J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 25-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). 5α-Reduction of testosterone is an irreversible reaction. Androgen action is terminated when these steroids are converted to metabolites that have little or no affinity for the androgen receptor. A major catabolic pathway involves the sequential conversion of dihydrotestosterone to 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-adiol) and thereafter to androsterone (3Fieser L.F. Fieser M. Steroids. Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York1959: 503-538Google Scholar). Both of these reactions are potentially reversible (see Fig. 1). Under normal conditions, an equilibrium exists between androgen synthesis and breakdown and a steady state level of active hormone is maintained in target tissues. An imbalance between input and output can lead to androgen excess and contribute to certain disease states, especially benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Two mechanisms are postulated to produce excess dihydrotestosterone in the prostate. In one, an elevated expression of steroid 5α-reductase leads to increased synthesis of the hormone. In the other, a decrease in the breakdown of dihydrotestosterone occurs as a consequence of either reduced expression of a catabolic enzyme or by a change in the direction of the reaction. The latter mechanism is illustrated by the differential metabolism of 3α-adiol (Fig. 1). If a reductive 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) activity predominates in the prostate, then dihydrotestosterone is converted into 3α-adiol and thereafter into androsterone, which is readily glucuronidated (4Beaulieu M. Lévesque E. Hum D.W. Bélanger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22855-22862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and excreted from the tissue. However, if an oxidative 3α-HSD activity predominates, then 3α-adiol arising within the tissue or from exogenous sources is converted back into the active androgen dihydrotestosterone (Fig. 1). Evidence supporting that androgen excess can be caused by an increase in steroid 5α-reductase activity has been obtained from enzyme measurements and immunohistochemical analysis of benign prostatic hyperplastic and prostate cancer tissue (5Brendler C.B. Follansbee A.L. Isaacs J.T. J. Urol. 1985; 133: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Silver R.I. Wiley E.L. Davis D.L. Thigpen A.E. Russell D.W. McConnell J.D. J. Urol. 1994; 152: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The levels of steroid 5α-reductase activity and protein are increased in these tissues. Dihydrotestosterone can also be synthesized from 3α-adiol. When radiolabeled 3α-adiol is administered to castrated and functionally hepatectomized rats, it is converted into dihydrotestosterone and to a lesser extent into androsterone in the ventral prostate (7Bruchovsky N. Endocrinology. 1971; 89: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for this conversion has not been elucidated, in part due to a paucity of information regarding androgen catabolizing enzymes in the prostate. Two closely related reductive 3α-HSD isozymes are expressed in the human prostate (8Penning, T. M. (1997) Endocr. Rev., in press.Google Scholar), and an oxidative 17β-HSD type 2 isozyme and mRNA are present in benign and malignant human prostate tissue (9Elo J.P. Akinola L.A. Poutanen M. Vihko P. Kyllönen A.P. Lukkarinen O. Vihko R. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) but the roles of these enzymes in the metabolism of dihydrotestosterone are not known. To gain further insight into androgen catabolism in the prostate, we took an expression cloning approach to identify gene products capable of metabolizing 3α-adiol. These experiments identified an oxidative 17β-HSD isozyme that converts 3α-adiol to androsterone and whose mRNA is expressed in the rat ventral prostate and liver. The encoded protein, referred to as 17β-HSD6, shares extensive sequence homology with retinol dehydrogenase 1 (RoDH1) (10Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3900-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which led us to test the hypothesis that RoDH1 might also metabolize steroid hormones. Expression studies with rat and human RoDH cDNAs show that RoDH can also serve as an oxidative 3α-HSD that efficiently catalyzes the back reaction of 3α-adiol to dihydrotestosterone. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was synthesized from rat ventral prostate poly(A)+-enriched RNA (5 μg) using a SuperScript cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc., Bethesda, MD). cDNAs were ligated to SalI adaptors, size-fractionated by gel filtration, and unidirectionally ligated into SalI-NotI digested pCMV6 vector (11Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 20-μl ligation mixture was divided into 0.1-μl aliquots, which were individually transformed into 100 μl of MAX Efficiency DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), yielding pools of 5,000 independent recombinants per transformation. The transformation mixture (1 ml) was diluted by the addition of 3 ml of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, plasmid DNA was isolated from the bacterial cells by column purification (Promega Mini-Prep, Madison, WI) and transfected into mammalian cells. Pools of cDNAs were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC CRL number 1573) by the calcium phosphate method using an MBS Transfection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The 293 cells were grown in monolayer at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 8–9% CO2 and maintained in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum). On day 0 of a transfection experiment, 700,000 cells were plated in medium A per 50-mm dish. On day 2, cells were cotransfected with 4.5 μg of plasmid cDNA pool and 0.5 μg of pVA1, a plasmid encoding adenovirus VA1 RNA, which enhances expression of transfected cDNAs via a translational mechanism (12Schneider R.J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 317-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After the transfection procedure, which involved a 3-h incubation at 35 °C in a 3% CO2 atmosphere, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then placed under 3 ml of medium A. At 16 h, medium A was replaced with medium A containing 50 nm [3H]5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-adiol, specific activity 49.0 Ci/mmol), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 3 h. Thereafter, 1 ml of medium was removed from each dish and subjected to extraction with 7 volumes of methylene chloride. Separation of steroids was performed as outlined below. In an initial screen of 36 pools of 5,000 cDNAs each, 13 pools showed conversion of 3α-adiol into androsterone over background levels obtained in mock-transfected cells. The DNAs from one of several positive pools (number 12, chosen at random), were retransformed intoEscherichia coli DH5α cells to generate pools of approximately 1,000 independent transformants each. These plasmid DNAs were transfected into 293 cells to identify 6 positive pools. Further subfractionation into pools of 200, 50, 10, and individual cDNA-containing plasmids yielded a final positive clone. For assay of enzyme activity in transfected cell lysates, cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline from dishes 30 h post-transfection using a rubber policeman pelleted by centrifugation, and either frozen in liquid N2for storage at −80 °C, or lysed and assayed immediately. Cell pellets were homogenized in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA with three short pulses of a Brinkmann Polytron. Enzyme assays were performed in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. Incubations were performed at 37 °C without shaking for 5–15 min and contained a final cofactor concentration of 1 mm. The concentration of protein in cell extracts was determined by the method of Bradford using a kit (Bio-Rad Protein Assay) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Assay mixtures (500 μl) were extracted with 14 volumes of methylene chloride. Following isolation and evaporation of the organic phase, steroids were dissolved in 35 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), spotted on thin layer chromatography plates (LK5D Silica Gel, Whatman Lab Sales) and resolved by development in chloroform/ethyl acetate (3:1). Reaction products were visualized by exposure to PhosphorImaging plates and analyzed on a BAS 1000 PhosphorImager (Fuji, Stamford, CT). Kinetic constants for steroid substrates and cofactors were measured by conventional Lineweaver-Burk analyses. All assays were repeated in triplicate using cell lysates from different transfection experiments. Ten concentrations of substrate between 0.01 and 5 μmwere used for each steroid. For the determination of apparent cofactorK m values, five concentrations between 1 and 16 μm were used for NAD+ and five concentrations between 1 and 10 mm were used for NADP+, both with [3H]3α-adiol at 2.0 μm. 13-cis-Retinoic acid (13-cis-RA) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) were dissolved in ethanol to a final concentration of 10 mm and stored under nitrogen at −20 °C in amber vials. Enzyme assay solutions described above were supplemented with these solutions to achieve final retinoid concentrations between 0.001 and 100 μm and incubations were performed under low light conditions. Inhibition constants (apparent K i values) were obtained by Dixon plot analysis of transfected cell lysate activity in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of 13-cis-RA and 9-cis-RA with two different [3H]3α-adiol substrate concentrations.

Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of mRNA, cDNAs were unidirectionally ligated into the LambdaZiplox vector and packaged with a MaxPlax Lambda Packaging extract (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). This library was screened with a probe generated by radiolabeling with random hexamers (Mega Prime Labeling kit, Amersham) from the 17β-HSD6 cDNA shown in Fig. 3. Out of 100,000 recombinants screened, 18 hybridization positive plaques were identified, two of which were purified through additional rounds of screening, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis using SP6 and T7 primers. Another 100,000 recombinants were screened with a 3′-untranslated region probe to produce an additional seven hybridization positive plaques, of which four were analyzed by DNA sequencing.Figure 3cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of rat 17β-HSD6.

Approximately 105 recombinants were screened with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to nucleotides 1–966 of the rat RoDH1 cDNA (10Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3900-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After hybridization in 50% formamide at 42 °C, filters were washed under reduced stringency conditions (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, 0.2% (w/v) SDS at 55 °C for 1 h). Two identical hybridization positives were isolated and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated by guanidine thiocyanate extraction using RNA STAT 60 (TEL-TEST “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Poly(A)+-enriched RNA was isolated with a mRNA Purification Kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). RNA was size-fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.4% (w/v) agarose gel, transferred to nylon filters (Biotrans, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) by capillary blotting, and hybridized and washed as described (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Human Multiple Tissue RNA blots were purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). All RNA blots were probed with 3′-untranslated region probes, which were generated by amplification via the polymerase chain reaction, gel purification, and random hexamer radiolabeling. The individual probes were: 17β-HSD6, nt 1246–1521 of Fig. 3 (GenBank accession number U89280); rat RoDH1, nt 1252–1347 (GenBank accession number U18762) described in Ref. 10Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M.

The effects of androgens on the expression of 17β-HSD6 mRNA in the rat ventral prostate were determined in normal (N), castrate (C), and androgen-supplemented castrates (C+T) as described (14Moore R.J. Wilson J.D. Endocrinology. 1973; 93: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, groups of sexually mature Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) (n = 4–7) were either castrated via a scrotal route or sham operated on day 0 of an experiment. On days 7–10, the N and C groups received daily injections (0.2 ml) of vehicle (sesame oil) alone, and the C+T group received 0.2-ml injections containing 2 mg of testosterone acetate. Animals were killed on the morning of day 10, ventral prostates were dissected free of connective tissue and fat, and total RNA was isolated by extraction with acidified phenol/guanidinium isothyocyanate. Hybridization signals were quantified by densitometry, normalized to the level of β-actin mRNA, and expressed as a percentage of signal measured in sham operated animals. An expression cloning approach in mammalian cells was used to identify rat prostatic gene products that metabolize 3α-adiol. A cDNA library comprised of approximately one million independent clones was first prepared in a pCMV vector using rat ventral prostate mRNA as a template. Transformants from the library were divided into pools of 5,000 colonies, and plasmid DNA prepared from each pool was transfected into cultured embryonic kidney 293 cells. After 16–20 h, [3H]3α-adiol was added to the cell medium at a concentration of 50 nm and the incubation was continued for an additional 3 h. Thereafter steroids were extracted from the medium and separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates. An initial screen of 36 pools revealed several that contained a cDNA encoding an enzyme that converted 3α-adiol into androsterone (Fig. 2 A). No pools were identified that contained an activity capable of converting 3α-adiol to dihydrotestosterone. One of the pools (number 12) that contained a 3α-adiol → androsterone activity was subdivided into progressively smaller pools by transfection screening until a single cDNA that encoded this activity was identified (Fig. 2, B-F). The nucleotide sequence of the rat cDNA insert harbored by the active clone is shown in Fig. 3. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed a 5′-untranslated region of 231 nucleotides (nt), a potential coding region of 981 nt that could specify a protein of 327 amino acids, and a 3′-untranslated region of 318 nt followed by a polyadenylate tract. An in-frame stop codon was located 15 nucleotides upstream of the methionine codon that initiated the longest translational reading frame. The sequence around this methionine codon demonstrated a poor match (7/13 nt) with the Kozak consensus (GCCGCC(A/G)CCAUGG, Ref. 15Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). A second methionine codon within a similar context (7/13 nt matches) was located at amino acid 11 of the deduced protein sequence (Fig. 3). This arrangement of methionine codons and their contexts' precluded an unambiguous identification of the true amino terminus and complicated calculation of the molecular weight of the encoded protein. If the first methionine marks the amino terminus, then the predicted molecular weight of the enzyme is 37,100, whereas if the second methionine fills this role then the molecular weight is 36,100. The reaction catalyzed by the cDNA-encoded enzyme involves the oxidation of an alcohol substituent at carbon 17 of the 3α-adiol substrate to a 17-oxo group in the androsterone product (Fig. 1). Enzymes that catalyze this reaction are referred to as 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSD). Five 17β-HSD enzymes have previously been identified (17β-HSD1 through 17β-HSD5, see “Discussion”) and for this reason, the protein encoded by the cDNA was termed 17β-HSD6. The kinetic constants that describe the conversion of 3α-adiol to androsterone by rat 17β-HSD6 were determined in cell lysates prepared from transfected 293 cells. An apparent K m of 0.1 μm and a V max of 2.5 nmol/min/mg cell lysate were measured for this enzyme (Table I). The expressed enzyme exhibited lower affinity and activity with dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, and estradiol. Additional experiments revealed that the 17β-HSD6 enzyme possessed a weak oxidative 3α-HSD activity, converting androsterone into 5α-androstanedione with an apparent K m of 0.2 μm and V max of 0.1 nmol/min/mg cell lysate protein. No oxidative 3α-HSD activity against 3α-adiol was detected in these experiments. The 17β-HSD6 enzyme preferred NAD+ (apparent K m = 3 μm) over NADP+ (apparent K m = 1 mm) as a cofactor when 3α-adiol was used as substrate. A comparison of the relative efficiencies (determined asV max/K m) of the reactions catalyzed by 17β-HSD6 showed that the enzyme was most active as an oxidative 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase against 3α-adiol (TableI).Table IKinetic constants of steroid metabolizing enzymesEnzymeSubstrateProductActivityK mV maxV max/K mμmnmol min −1 mg −117β-HSD63α-AdiolAndrosteroneOx1-aOx, oxidative; Red, reductive.17β-HSD0.12.525AndrosteroneAndrostanedioneOx 3α-HSD0.20.10.5DihydrotestosteroneAndrostanedioneOx 17β-HSD0.50.20.4TestosteroneAndrostenedioneOx 17β-HSD1.10.20.2Estradiol1-bExperiments utilizing estradiol as substrate were carried out with transfected cell lysates that were different from those that used androgens as substrates.

Raw data were analyzed with the Kcatr Program to calculate apparent K m and V maxvalues. The tissue distribution of rat 17β-HSD6 was assessed by RNA blotting. Poly(A+)-enriched RNA was prepared from 10 tissues, transferred to a nylon filter, and probed with a radiolabeled DNA fragment. The probe was derived from the 3′-untranslated region of the rat 17β-HSD6 cDNA to reduce the possibility of cross-hybridization to homologous mRNAs (see below). A single mRNA of approximately 1.5–1.6 kb was detected in three tissues, including the ventral prostate, liver, and kidney (Fig.4 A). The levels of this mRNA were highest in the ventral prostate and liver, and much lower in the kidney. The abundance of 17β-HSD6 mRNA in the ventral prostate agrees well with the large number of positive pools identified in the initial expression cloning experiments (Fig. 2 A) and the size of the rat mRNA detected by blotting (1.5–1.6 kb) is similar to that of the isolated cDNA (1.53 kb, Fig. 3). To determine if circulating androgens influenced the expression of 17β-HSD6 in the ventral prostate, the level of this mRNA was compared in normal (lane 1), castrated (lane 2), and castrated plus androgen-supplemented (lane 3) rats (Fig.4 B). Castration was associated with a substantial decrease of 17β-HSD6 mRNA (to 13% of normal) in the ventral prostate. Administration of androgens to castrates for a 3-day period increased the level of 17β-HSD6 mRNA to 56% of normal levels. The amount of a control mRNA (β-actin) remained unchanged (right panel, Fig. 4 B). These marked changes in 17β-HSD6 mRNA in response to androgen depletion and repletion could mean that the hormone is required for expression of 17β-HSD6 in the ventral prostate. Alternatively, the reduction in 17β-HSD6 mRNA levels after castration may be a secondary effect resulting from the marked decrease in the number of epithelial cells that occurs upon androgen withdrawal in this gland (16Sandford N.L. Searle J.W. Kerr J.F. Pathology. 1984; 16: 406-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A comparison of the predicted protein sequence of rat 17β-HSD6 to those in the data bases indicated that the enzyme shared sequence identity with numerous members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. Among these family members, the most closely related protein was rat RoDH1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of retinol to retinal (10Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3900-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An alignment of rat 17β-HSD6 and RoDH1 protein sequences is shown in Fig. 5 and revealed that the two proteins share 65% sequence identity over their entire lengths. The shared sequence identity began at the second methionine of the 17β-HSD6 sequence (see Fig. 3), which suggested that the second and not the first methionine may be the true initiator methionine codon. A cDNA clone encoding a human RoDH protein was subsequently isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and a comparison of the deduced protein sequences of the rat 17β-HSD6, rat RoDH1, and human RoDH enzymes again revealed extensive sequence identities (Fig. 5). The sequence conservation between 17β-HSD6, a steroid metabolizing enzyme, and RoDH, a retinoid metabolizing enzyme, raised the question of whether RoDH might act on certain steroid substrates. To test this idea, expression vectors containing either the rat or human RoDH cDNAs were constructed and transfected into cultured 293 cells. A vector containing a rat 17β-HSD6 cDNA served as a positive control in these experiments. Cell lysates were prepared from transfected cells, incubated with different radiolabeled steroid substrates, and the metabolism of these compounds was followed by thin layer chromatography. Recombinant rat and human RoDH actively catalyzed the oxidation of 3α-adiol to dihydrotestosterone (Fig.6 A), indicating that these enzymes were potent oxidative 3α-HSD (Fig. 1). For example, when 1 μg of cell lysate containing either recombinant human or rat RoDH was incubated with 3α-adiol, approximately half of the substrate was converted into a product (Fig. 6 A, lanes 8 and 10) with a mobility identical to that of dihydrotestosterone standards (Fig.6 A, lanes 1 and 12). Increasing the amount of cell lysate containing human RoDH resulted in more conversion of substrate to product (lanes 4–7). NAD+ was the preferred cofactor in these experiments (apparent K m = 8–15 μm for rat and human isozymes) versusNADP+ (apparent K m = 7–10 mm). The rat 17β-HSD6 enzyme initially converts 3α-adiol to androsterone, whereas the RoDH enzymes convert 3α-adiol to dihydrotestosterone. Androsterone and dihydrotestosterone migrate with almost identical R f values on silica gel plates (Fig. 6 A), which makes unambiguous identification of the two compounds difficult. To resolve this issue, an experiment identical to that shown in Fig. 6 A was carried out except that the steroids were chromatographed on aluminum oxide plates. Chromat"

Here we analyzed retinoids binding of the enzyme by monitoring the fluorescence quenching of an intrinsic tryptophan residue, and appearance of circular dichroism around 330 nm, and a red shift of the UV absorption spectra of retinoids. We found that the enzyme binds all-trans- or 9-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans- or 13-cis-retinal, but not all-trans-retinol, with affinities (K d of 70–80 nm) sufficient for function as a retinoid transporter. All-trans-retinoic acid inhibited the enzyme activity in a noncompetitive manner, suggesting that it binds to the same hydrophobic pocket as prostaglandin H2, the substrate for prostaglandin D synthase, but at a different site in this pocket. It is likely that this enzyme is a bifunctional protein that acts as both retinoid transporter and prostaglandin D2-producing enzyme.

Retinoids play an important role in regulating a variety of biological processes, including differentiation, morphogenesis, and cell proliferation. The process is initiated by retinoid binding to the nuclear receptor for retinoic acid (RAR/RXR) 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RBP, retinol-binding protein; CRBP, cellular retinol-binding protein; CRABP, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein; PG, prostaglandin. ; RAR binds both all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acids, whereas RXR is specific for the 9-cis-isomer (1Leid M.

The binding of retinoic acids to the dimerized receptor, RAR-RXR or RXR-RXR, activates or inhibits the transcription of retinoid-responsive genes. The proteins that transport retinoids are divided into two distinct families based on their sequence, structure, and function: the secretory transporters and the intracellular transporters (4Newcomer M.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Secretory retinoid transporters, such as plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) and β-lactoglobulin, circulate retinoids in a variety of body fluids and transport them to the intracellular retinoid transporters, cellular RBP (CRBP), and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP), which finally transfer the retinoids to RAR or RXR. Retinoids also regulate a number of genes expressed in the central nervous system and thus play a variety of important roles, particularly in development (5Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Kastner P. Krust A.

However, secretory retinoid transporters in the central nervous system have not been identified, although retinoids would need to change transporters at the blood-brain barrier as the barrier is impermeable to the secretory transporter. Recently, a major protein in human cerebrospinal fluid, classically termed β-trace (10Clausen J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1961; 107: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), was identified as prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (11Kuruvilla A.P. Hochwald G.M. Ghiso J. Castaño E.M. Pizzolato M. Frangione B.

The enzyme is responsible for biosynthesis of PGD2, which is a major PG in the brain of various mammals, including humans, and is proposed to be an endogenous sleep-promoting substance (15Hayaishi O. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2575-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 16Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Matsumura H. Watanabe K. J. Lipid Mediat.

Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 257-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PGD synthase is produced in the choroid plexus, leptomeninges, and oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system (19Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Kaneko T. Konishi A. Mizuno N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

It is also localized in the pigmented epithelial cells of the rat retina (21Beuckmann C.T. Gordon W.C. Kanaoka Y. Eguchi N. Marcheselli V.L. Gerashchenko D.Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Bazan N.G. J.

The results of cloning and sequence analyses of the rat and human cDNAs (23Urade Y. Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Fujii Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

A homology search in data bases of protein primary structure revealed that the enzyme is a new member of the lipocalin superfamily (24Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y.

The gene structures for the rat and human enzymes are also comparable with those of other members of the lipocalin superfamily, in terms of the numbers and sizes of the exons and the phasing patterns of the introns (29Igarashi M.

Furthermore, the gene for the enzyme has been mapped within the lipocalin gene cluster in human chromosome 9 (30White D.M. Mikol D.D. Espinosa R. Weimer B. Le Beau M.M. Stefansson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23202-23208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse chromosome 2 (31Chan P. Simon-Chazottes D. Mattei M.G. Guenet J.L. Salier J.P. Genomics. 1994; 23: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Secretory retinoid transporters, such as plasma RBP and β-lactoglobulin, are also members of the lipocalin family and show weak homology (20% identity) toward PGD synthase (24Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4020-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Toh H. Urade Y. Tanabe T. Mediat. Inflamm. 1992; 1: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered that the enzyme may be involved in the transport of bioactive lipophilic substances in the central nervous system via the cerebrospinal fluid, analogous to the functions of other lipocalins, such as plasma RBP in the systemic circulation and β-lactoglobulin in milk. In this study, by measuring the fluorescence, UV, and circular dichroism (CD) spectra after incubation of the recombinant rat brain PGD synthase (32Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with various isoforms of retinoid, we found that the enzyme binds all-trans- or 9-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans- or 13-cis-retinal with affinities comparable with those of other secretory retinoid transporters. All-trans-retinoic acid, all-trans-retinal, all-trans-retinol, andN-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide were purchased from Sigma. 9-cis-Retinoic acid was purchased from Wako Junyaku (Osaka, Japan), and 13-cis-retinal was provided by Dr. K. Yoshihara, Suntory Institute for Molecular Biology. [3H]Retinoids (2.20 GBq/mmol) and [1-14C]arachidonic acid (2.20 GBq/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. The full-length cDNA for rat brain PGD synthase, which is composed of 189 amino acid residues (GenBank™ accession number M61900) (24Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4020-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), was ligated into theEcoRI-HindIII site of pUC119. The N-terminal 29 amino acid residues containing the signal peptide were deleted, and the Cys residue was replaced by Ala, as reported previously (32Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme and the Cys → Ala-substituted mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 and were purified to apparent homogeneity by Sephadex G-50 and S-Sepharose column chromatography (32Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The Ala89,186 enzyme with a GS adduct at Cys65 was prepared as reported previously (32Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Retinoids were dissolved in ethanol to give a stock solution of 1 mm. The concentrations of retinoic acid, retinal, and retinol were determined spectrophotometrically in an ethanol solution based on their respective molar absorption coefficients of ε336 of 45,000m−1 cm−1, ε383 of 42,800m−1 cm−1, and ε325 of 46,000m−1 cm−1, respectively (33Robert S.H. Liu S.H. Asato A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 88: 506-516Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The retinoid solution (10 μl), which also contained a trace amount of [3H]retinoids (10,000 dpm), was added to 1 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 nmol of the purified enzyme. After incubation at 22 °C for 30 min, the fluorescence of the tryptophan residue was measured with a Shimazu Spectrofluorophotometer RF-5000 (Kyoto, Japan) with the excitation wavelength at 282 nm and emission wavelength at 338 nm. The loss of ligand, due to nonspecific adsorption to the incubation tubes, was corrected for by measuring the radioactivity of the [3H]retinoids in the incubation mixture after the measurements. The titration ofN-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide was used to correct for the quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence due to nonspecific interactions with retinoids. The apparent dissociation constant (K d) of a single binding site was calculated by the method of Cogan et al.(34Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), P0α=(R0/n)(α/1−α)−Kd/nEquation 1 where α is the fraction of free binding sites,R 0 is the total concentration of retinoid,P 0 is the total concentration of the enzyme, andn is the apparent molar ratio of the ligand to the enzyme at saturation. The value of α was calculated for every point on the titration curve by the following equation, α=(F−Fmin)/(F0−Fmin)Equation 2 where F is the relative fluorescence intensity at a certain R 0, F min is the minimum fluorescence intensity after saturation of all ligand-binding sites of the enzyme (in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of ligand), and F 0 is the initial fluorescence intensity in the absence of ligand. Absorption spectra were recorded at 25 °C after the addition of retinoids (20 μm, final concentration) or an equal volume of buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) to the enzyme (80 μm, final concentration) for a final volume of 1 ml in a cuvette (10-mm path length) in a DU 64 spectrophotometer (Beckman). CD spectra were measured after incubation of the protein (80 μm) with retinoids (20 μm) in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (2 ml). They were recorded on a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscope, Tokyo, Japan) with the sample in a 10-mm path length cuvette at 10 °C. The spectra were recorded five times for each sample in the near-UV range from 300 to 400 nm, with a bandwidth of 1 nm and a resolution of 1 nm. The PGD synthase activity was measured by incubation at 25 °C for 1 min with [1-14C]PGH2 (final 40 μm) in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in the presence of 1 mm GSH, unless otherwise stated (35Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [1-14C]PGH2 was prepared from [1-14C]arachidonic acid (35Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The model of PGD synthase was built with a homology modeling software HOMOLOGY (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) as reported previously (36Toh H. Kubodera H. Nakajima N. Sekiya T. Eguchi N. Tanaka T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1067-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid was built and manually docked into the cavity of PGD synthase by using Insight II molecular modeling software (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). During the process, we referred to the binding structure between rat epididymal retinoic acid-binding protein and retinoic acid (Protein Data Bank entry 1EPB), because this protein shows a sequence similarity of 19.7% identity to PGD synthase, and the amino acids lining the bottom of the hydrophobic cavity well correspond to those of PGD synthase. The model was further refined by manual modification of side chains to circumvent unfavorable atom-atom bumping. After the manual operation, molecular mechanics calculations were performed to relax side chains with the main chain fixed, by use of DISCOVER (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Several members of the lipocalin family, such as plasma RBP (37Zanotti G. Malpeli G. Berni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24873-24879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β-lactoglobulin (38Papiz M.Z. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. North A.C.T. Findlay J.B.C. Sivaprasadarao R. Jones T.A.

A. 1993; 90: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), function as secretory retinoid transporters in a variety of body fluids. Since the binding of retinoids to those proteins is known to quench their intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, we monitored the tryptophan fluorescence of recombinant PGD synthase after incubation with retinoids. For this purpose, we used recombinant Δ1–29 PGD synthase (32Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) from which the signal sequence had been deleted. The Δ1–29 PGD synthase showed fluorescence quenching after addition of all-trans-retinoic acid in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). The fluorescence intensity decreased to 20% in the presence of excess amounts of all-trans-retinoic acid (Fig. 1 B). The quenching was not observed after denaturation of the protein in the presence of 6m guanidine hydrochloride. 9-cis-Retinoic acid resulted in fluorescence quenching, giving an almost identical titration curve to that of all-trans-retinoic acid (Fig.1 B). All-trans-retinal and 13-cis-retinal also quenched the fluorescence to about 40%; however, all-trans-retinol led to only 20% quenching under conditions of ligand excess. When P 0α was plotted againstR 0α(1 − α) by the method of Coganet al. (34Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), a positive regression line was obtained for the fluorescence quenching of the Δ1–29 enzyme with all-trans-retinoic acid (Fig. 1 C). The number of apparent binding sites of the Δ1–29 enzyme was calculated from the slope to be 1.1 mol/mol, and the K d value was found to be 80 nm. The K d values for 9-cis-retinoic acid, all-trans-retinal, and 13-cis-retinal were 80, 70, and 70 nm, respectively, and the stoichiometries of the retinoid-protein complexes were about 1.1 for the three retinoids (Table I). The affinities of the enzyme for all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid were comparable with or somewhat higher than those of other retinoid transporters. The K d value for all-trans-retinol was not determined.Table IRetinoid affinities of recombinant PGD synthase and retinoid transporter proteinsProtein (species)RetinoidsK d nmRef.Δ1–29 PGD synthase (rat)All-trans-retinoic acid80 ± 15This study9-cis-Retinoic acid80 ± 20This studyAll-trans-retinal70 ± 30This study13-cis-Retinal70 ± 20This studyAll-trans-retinolND1-aND, not determined.This studyβ-Lactoglobulin (bovine)All-trans-retinoic acid3940Cho Y.

Open table in a new tab In the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinoic acid and all-trans-retinal still exhibited fluorescence quenching and gave titration curves essentially identical to those in the absence of retinol (data not shown). These results indicate that retinol does not displace retinoic acid or retinal from the protein. Changes in the UV and CD spectra of retinoids have been reported to occur when retinoids bind to their transporter proteins, such as plasma RBP (41Horwitz J. Heller J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4712-4719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β-lactoglobulin (42Fugate R.D. Song P.-S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 625: 28-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CRBP (43Levin M.S. Locke B. Yang N.C. Li E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

Genet. 1992; 13: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the UV and CD spectra of retinoids after incubation with PGD synthase. Retinoic acid, retinal, and retinol yielded absorption spectra with peaks at 340, 380, and 317 nm, respectively. After forming the complex with PGD synthase, the spectra of all-trans-retinoic acid and all-trans-retinal were red-shifted approximately 30 nm, with peaks at 373 and 409 nm, respectively (Fig. 2,A and B). On the other hand, all-trans-retinol did not induce a significant change in the spectrum and instead produced a small shoulder around 373 nm (Fig.2 C). Incubation of the protein with all-trans-retinoic acid and all-trans-retinal induced changes in the CD spectra, with minima at 345 and 369 nm, respectively (Fig. 3,A and B). However, when the protein was incubated with all-trans-retinol, a weak positive change in the CD spectra was observed around 300 nm (Fig. 3 C). These changes in the UV and CD spectra indicate that retinoic acid and retinal occupy fixed positions in the protein. We constructed three types of Cys → Ala-substituted mutants of PGD synthase, which contains three Cys residues at 65, 89, and 186: the Ala65 mutant without the Cys65 active thiol that is essential for the catalytic reaction, the Ala89,186mutants lacking the intramolecular disulfide linkage between Cys89 and Cys186, and the Ala65,89,186 mutant lacking all of the Cys residues (32Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The titration curves of fluorescence quenching with all-trans-retinoic acid were almost identical between the Δ1–29 enzyme and the Ala65 mutant, indicating that the active thiol of Cys65 is not necessary for the retinoic acid binding (Fig. 4). The Cys65 residue is considered to be located in the hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme, and it is reactive with a sulfhydryl modifier and reduced glutathione (GSH) (32Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When the Cys65 residue of the parent and Ala89,186 enzymes was modified with GSH to form a glutathione adduct, the fluorescence quenching was inhibited by about 90% under conditions of ligand excess (Fig. 4). The Cys65residue of the parent and Ala89,186 enzymes is also endogenously modified during expression in E. coli (32Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The endogenously modified enzymes displayed only 10% of the fluorescence quenching after incubation with excess amounts of all-trans-retinoic acid (data not shown). Once the exogenous or endogenous modifiers were removed from Cys65 by treatment with dithiothreitol as reported previously (32Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the retinoic acid binding activity was again recovered. These results suggest that retinoic acid binds in the hydrophobic pocket of PGD synthase, in which the active site of the enzyme is located. When the disulfide linkage in the parent and Ala65 enzymes was cleaved by incubation with 1 mm dithiothreitol for 15 h, the fluorescence quenching was attenuated by about 40% in the presence of excess all-trans-retinoic acid (Fig. 4). Both the Ala89,186 and Ala65,89,186 mutants without the disulfide bond also exhibited weak fluorescence quenching with all-trans-retinoic acid, similar to the reduced forms of the parent and Ala65 enzymes. The K d values for the single binding sites of the parent and Ala65enzymes of the reduced form, and the Ala89,186 and Ala65,89,186 mutants, were about 160 nm. These results suggest that the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys89 and Cys186 strengthens the binding affinity for retinoic acid by 1.5–2-fold. We then examined the effects of retinoids on the PGD synthase activity. Fig.5 A shows the inhibition of enzyme activity by all-trans-retinoic acid and retinol. Retinol did not inhibit the enzyme activity, whereas the addition of all-trans-retinoic acid reduced the enzyme activity. This result suggests that all-trans-retinoic acid binds in the active site of the enzyme but that retinol does not bind there. The mode of inhibition by retinoic acid was analyzed at various substrate and retinoic acid concentrations. The results of this study are shown in the Lineweaver-Burk plot in Fig. 5 B. The series of lines at different retinoic acid concentrations intersects at the 1/[substrate] axis, indicating that retinoic acid inhibits the enzyme activity in a noncompetitive manner. The individual binding sites for retinoic acid and PGH2 are occupied independently. TheK m value of PGD synthase with respect to PGH2 was calculated to be 5 μm, which is a similar value to that obtained for PGD synthase isolated from rat brain (14 μm) (35Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the K i value for retinoic acid was 5 μm. The retinoid binding by PGD synthase was demonstrated by the measurement of fluorescence quenching of Trp residues of the enzyme (Figs. 1 and 4) and the red shift of the UV spectra (Fig. 2) and the appearance of CD spectral changes around 330 nm (Fig. 3) of retinoids. Among all-trans-retinoids, PGD synthase is specifically bound to retinoic acid and retinal, but not retinol (Figs. 1, 2, 3), suggesting that the functional groups, such as amino or hydroxy group exist in the ligand-binding pocket to interact with the carbonyl group of retinoic acid or retinal. We found that 9-cis-retinoic acid also bound PGD synthase with the same affinity as that of all-trans-retinoic acid (Fig. 1 B). Both all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acids are ligands for RXR and RAR. All-trans-retinoic acid may be bound as a horseshoe conformation twisted at the C-8–C-9 bond, similar to that of the 9-cis-isoform. This is also found in the case of the epididymal retinoic acid-binding protein (2Newcomer M.E. Pappas R.S. Ong D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PGD synthase possesses three Cys residues: Cys65 is an essential thiol for the catalytic activity, and Cys89 and Cys186 form an intramolecular disulfide bridge. Our results indicate that Cys65 is crucial for the enzyme activity, but not for retinoid binding, because the substitution of Cys65to Ala did not any affect retinoid binding (Fig. 4). However, when Cys65 was modified with GSH, the retinoid binding was abolished (Fig. 4). Modification by GSH is a mild chemical modification, and therefore, it should not alter the conformation of the enzyme. We confirmed that CD spectrum of the Δ1–29 Ala89,186 enzyme was unchanged by the GSH modification of Cys65 (data not shown). It is, therefore, considered that all-trans-retinoic acid cannot enter the hydrophobic pocket of the modified enzyme, due to the steric hindrance by GSH. Furthermore, we speculated that retinoic acid binds in the same cavity as the substrate binds. In fact, all-trans-retinoic acid, but not all-trans-retinol, inhibited the enzyme activity in a noncompetitive manner (Fig. 5). Our results suggest that retinoic acid binds in the same cavity, but at a different site from where the substrate binds. Two types of β-lactoglobulin-retinol complex have been reported: one in which retinol binds in the cavity (38Papiz M.Z. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. North A.C.T. Findlay J.B.C. Sivaprasadarao R. Jones T.A. Newcomer M.E. Kraulis P.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) and the other where retinol binds to the external surface of β-lactoglobulin (39Monaco H.L. Zanotti G.M Spadon P. Bolognesi M. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Retinoid binding by PGD synthase corresponds to the former case. We constructed a computer graphic model of PGD synthase and successfully placed retinoic acid within the hydrophobic cavity of the enzyme (Fig. 6). Based on the observed sequence homology, the enzyme is predicted to form an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structure with a hydrophobic pocket, similar to other lipocalins (24Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4020-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 36Toh H. Kubodera H. Nakajima N. Sekiya T. Eguchi N. Tanaka T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1067-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Retinoids usually bind in the hydrophobic pocket of their transporters with the β-ionone ring of the retinoid toward the inside and the tail portion outside. In the model, retinoic acid binds at the bottom of the cavity with the distance from Trp43 short enough to cause the fluorescence quenching. The Trp residue is highly conserved among members of the lipocalin family. The Cys65 residue is located near the edge of the cavity, and PGH2 binds relatively outside of the cavity. Binding of retinoic acid interferes with the interaction between PGH2and Cys65, which is in good agreement with the fact that retinoic acid inhibited the enzyme activity. PGD synthase was originally isolated as an enzyme converting PGH2 to PGD2. In the arachidonic acid cascade, arachidonic acid is converted to PGH2 by PGH synthase, a membrane protein associated with both cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities. Since PGH2 is an unstable, highly reactive precursor, PGD synthase should exist close to PGH synthase. As soon as PGH2 is formed by PGH synthase from arachidonic acid, PGD synthase takes PGH2 and converts it to the stable PGD2. This reaction should be carried out near the membranes. In rat oligodendrocytes (19Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Kaneko T. Konishi A. Mizuno N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15132-15136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human arachnoid barrier cells (45Yamashima T. Sakuda K. Tohma Y. Yamashita J. Oda H. Iikura D. Eguchi N. Beuckmann C.T. Kanaoka Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2376-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme was found by electron microscopy to be localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and outer nuclear membrane. The fact that retinoic acid inhibits production of PGD2 (Fig. 5) suggests that retinoids may endogenously regulate the synthesis of PGD2. On the other hand, PGD synthase is also actively secreted into cerebrospinal fluid, interphotoreceptor matrix, and seminal plasma, in which a continuous supply of the substrate is unlikely. PGD synthase would thus have another function as a secretory protein. In fact, as shown in this study, the enzyme possesses high affinities for retinoids (K d < 100 nm), sufficient for it to function as a secretory retinoid transporter (Table I). In the cerebrospinal fluid, the enzyme (β-trace) is found to be the second major protein following albumin. Moreover, different from albumin, which penetrates from the systemic circulation, PGD synthase is synthesized at the arachnoid membrane and choroid plexus in the brain, which form the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Transthyretin is also produced in the choroid plexus and mediates the transport of thyroxine from the blood stream to the thyroxine receptors in the brain (46Dickson P.W. Aldred A.R. Menting J.G.T. Marley P.D. Sawyer W.H. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13907-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As judged by the affinities for retinoids, the content in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the sites of production, we propose that one of the functions of the secretory PGD synthase (β-trace) is to transport retinoids in the brain. PGD synthase seems to be distributed where retinoids are required. For example, PGD synthase is detected in the neurons of infant rat brains, despite the absence of the corresponding mRNA. After the neurons have completely developed, PGD synthase is not detectable in them (19Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Kaneko T. Konishi A. Mizuno N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15132-15136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There should thus be a mechanism that allows PGD synthase to be taken into the immature nerve cell but not into the completely developed cell. This suggests that PGD synthase plays a critical role in regulating the development of the neurons by, for example, the transfer of all-trans- or 9-cis-retinoic acid to RAR or RXR in the immature nerve cell. PGD synthase is produced in the retinal pigment epithelium and secreted into the interphotoreceptor matrix (21Beuckmann C.T. Gordon W.C. Kanaoka Y. Eguchi N. Marcheselli V.L. Gerashchenko D.Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6119-6124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function there may be to supply retinal to the photoreceptor. PGD synthase showed lower binding affinity for retinoid when the disulfide bond between Cys89 and Cys186 was reduced (Fig. 4). Such reduction might facilitate the release of retinoids in the cell. Since PGD synthase binds all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid, and all-trans- and 13-cis-retinal with the same affinity as reported for other retinoid transporters (Table I), the secreted PGD synthase (β-trace) is considered to be a powerful newly recognized secretory retinoid transporter in the brain and retina. Proteins that may function as transporters of retinoids in the central nervous system have not been identified yet, although many genes in the brain and various photoreceptor functions are regulated by retinoids. Thus, our results suggest that, as well as functioning as the PGD2-producing enzyme, PGD synthase may play important roles in regulating retinoid metabolism as a secretory retinoid transporter.

Matsumoto, Osaka Bioscience Institute, for technical and secretarial assistance, respectively."

Specific and polarized expression of Ca2+ pumps was observed in all epithelial cells examined. Immunolocalization revealed expression of PMCA in both the basolateral and luminal membranes of all cell types. SERCA2a appeared to be expressed in the luminal pole, whereas SERCA2b was expressed in the basal pole and the nuclear envelope of pancreatic acini. Interestingly, SERCA2b was found in the luminal pole of submandibular salivary gland acinar and duct cells. These cells expressed SERCA3 in the basal pole. To examine the significance of the polarized expression of SERCA and perhaps PMCA pumps in secretory cells, we compared the effect of inhibition of SERCA pumps with thapsigargine and partial Ca2+ release with ionomycin on Ca2+ release evoked by agonists and Ca2+ uptake induced by antagonists. Despite their polarized expression, Ca2+ uptake by SERCA pumps and Ca2+ efflux by PMCA resulted in uniform reduction in [Ca2+] i. Surprisingly, inhibition of the SERCA pumps, but not Ca2+ release by ionomycin, eliminated the distinct initiation sites and propagated Ca2+ waves, leading to a uniform increase in [Ca2+] i. In addition, inhibition of SERCA pumps reduced the rate of Ca2+ release from internal stores. The implication of these findings to rates of Ca2+ diffusion in the cytosol, compartmentalization of Ca2+ signaling complexes, and mechanism of Ca2+ wave propagation are discussed.

The agonist-evoked Ca2+ signal is governed by the coordinated action of Ca2+ channels and Ca2+pumps (1Muallem S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 351-368PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years it has become clear that [Ca2+] i changes occur in the form of elemental events emanating in specialized microdomains and propagating as Ca2+ waves (see reviews in Ref. 2Cell Calcium (Special Issue)Cell CalciumVol. 20, number 2Berridge, M.

In the preceding manuscript (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) we showed similar phenomena in SMG acinar and duct cells. Characterization and localization of Ca2+release channels in the three cell types (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Thus, the cells express all three types of IP3R and the SMG cells also express the ryanodine receptor. Expression of the receptors appears to be confined to the area just underneath the luminal and lateral membranes (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).The type of Ca2+ pumps expressed in each cell type and their role in control of the [Ca2+] i wave is not known. Functional studies showed the presence of PMCA in pancreatic acini (8Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Loessberg P. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tepikin A.V. Voronina S.G. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In several studies isolated membranes and vesicles were used to localize the PMCA in the basolateral membrane of these cells (10Muallem S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, a recent study in which external [Ca2+] was measured suggested that Ca2+ pumping across the luminal membrane dominates Ca2+ efflux in stimulated acinar cells (11Belan P.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7615-7619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This predicts that the luminal membrane expresses high levels of PMCA.As in many cell types, Tg and other inhibitors of SERCA pumps release Ca2+ from internal stores of pancreatic acinar and SMG cells (8Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Loessberg P. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Again, the use of isolated endoplasmic reticulum vesicles shows the presence of Tg-sensitive Ca2+ pumping activity in pancreatic acinar cells (10Muallem S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). More recently an Ab raised against a C-terminal sequence of SERCA2b recognized two proteins of 111 and 97 kDa in pancreatic acini (14Dormer R.L. Capurro D.E. Morris R. Webb R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whether the cells express other SERCA isoforms and the localization of the SERCA pumps in pancreatic acini or SMG cells is not known.In the present work we used WB analysis, immunocytochemistry, and rapid [Ca2+] i imaging to identify, localize, and study the function of the PMCA and SERCA pumps in controlling the Ca2+ wave. Clear cell-specific and polarized expression of PMCA, SERCA2b, SERCA3, and SERCA2a were observed. Despite the high level of expression of PMCA in the luminal membrane, [Ca2+] i reduction in all parts of the cells occurred in the same rate. Completely unexpected was the finding that inhibition of the SERCA pumps with Tg abolished the initiation sites and led to a uniform and slow elevation in [Ca2+] i during agonist stimulation. These findings suggest a prominent role of the SERCA pumps in controlling the initiation site and propagation of the Ca2+ wave.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll methods pertaining to this manuscript are identical to those described in detail in the preceding manuscript including WB analysis, immunocytochemistry using isolated cells or tissue slices, and Ca2+ imaging. The clone 5F10 recognizing all isoforms of PMCA and clone IID8 recognizing SERCA2 were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). SERCA2b-specific pAb were raised against a 12-amino acid C-terminal sequence of SERCA2b and characterized as described (15Wuytack F. Eggermont J.A. Racymaekers L. Plessers L. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). pAb against SERCA2a were raised against a 9-amino acid C-terminal sequence of SERCA2a (16Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Verbist J. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Characterization of the SERCA3 pAb N89 was described before (17Wuytack F. Papp B. Verboomen H. Racymaekers L.

Somewhat unexpectedly we found that PMCA was expressed both in the luminal and basolateral membrane of the three cell types studied (Fig. 2). Traditionally, PMCA is assumed to be expressed only in the basolateral membrane. Actually, isolation of membrane vesicles from many cell types, including pancreatic (10Muallem S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and salivary glands (25Ambudkar I.S. Horn V.J. Baum B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) localized the PMCA to the basolateral membrane. However, most of these vesicle isolation techniques are not suitable for isolation of the luminal membrane, which is likely to be lost during membrane fractionation. On the other hand, a recent measurement of extracellular Ca2+ in small acini and single pancreatic acinar cells showed a more extensive Ca2+ efflux across the luminal membrane (11Belan P.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7615-7619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The higher level of PMCA expression in the luminal membrane found in the present study can account well for these findings. The identity of the PMCA isoforms expressed in the LM and BLM remains to be determined.In view of the higher levels of PMCA in the luminal membrane (Fig. 2) and the high Ca2+ efflux across this membrane in stimulated cells (see Ref. 11Belan P.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7615-7619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we expected to see a faster rate of reduction in [Ca2+] i in the LP when SERCA pumps were inhibited. This was not the case. Rather, Ca2+ efflux by PMCA resulted in uniform reduction in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 6, after Tg). The simplest explanation for this finding is that Ca2+ diffusion in the cytosol is significantly faster than Ca2+ efflux by PMCA. Indeed, efflux of all the released Ca2+ by PMCA required 20–30 s, sufficient time for Ca2+ to diffuse from the BLP to the LP (26Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar).Based on WB analysis and immunocytochemistry it is not possible to define all the isoforms of SERCA pump (or other proteins) expressed in the cells and their localization. However, this approach allowed us to demonstrate the first polarized expression of SERCA pumps in epithelial cells. Each of the cells studied appears to express at least two SERCA pump isoforms. All cells expressed the SERCA2b and SMG duct, and acinar cells express SERCA3. The picture with SERCA2a is less clear. The SERCA2a pAb were raised against a 9-amino acid C-terminal sequence of SERCA2a. A 5-amino acid sequence of this peptide are also found in SERCA2b at a distance of about 50 amino acids upstream of the C terminus (16Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Verbist J. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Hence, the possibility exists that the pAb against SERCA2a recognized some SERCA2b, although when tested no cross-reactivity of SERCA2a pAb with SERCA2b was found (16Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Verbist J. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, the two Ab appear to recognize SERCA pumps in different poles of pancreatic acinar cells. Hence, when taken together the results point to the possibility that pancreatic acinar cells express SERCA2b and SERCA2a, whereas SMG acinar and duct cells express SERCA2b and SERCA3.Interestingly, expression of the different SERCA pumps was highly polarized. Expression of SERCA2a is restricted to the LP and possibly the zymogen granule region of pancreatic acinar cells and SERCA3 to the basal pole of SMG duct and acinar cells. SERCA2b was expressed in the BLP of pancreatic acini and the LP and underneath the lateral membrane of SMG duct and acinar cells. Obviously, synthesis site and retention signals or sorting of SERCA2b must be cell-specific and different in the three cell types.Measurement of [Ca2+] i in cells inhibited by atropine (when reduction in [Ca2+] i is mostly due to uptake by the SERCA pumps; see Refs. 8Zhang B.-X.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24387-24393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not reveal major differences in Ca2+ uptake by the different SERCA pumps or at different regions of the cells. It is possible that Ca2+ diffusion in combination with only small differences in the properties of Ca2+ uptake by the different SERCA pumps (27Verboomen H. Wuytack F. DeSmedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) prevented detection of cellular Ca2+ gradients at the spacial resolution of Ca2+ recording of the present study. Hence, although at present the significance of the highly polarized expression of SERCA pumps is not known, it can be envisioned as contributing to the compartmentalization of the Ca2+pool and Ca2+ signaling, to allow site-specific regulation of [Ca2+] i.Completely unexpected was the finding that SERCA pump activity controls the Ca2+ wave initiation site and the rate of Ca2+ release (Fig. 5). One possible explanation of these findings is that Tg treatment caused fusion of the compartmentalized Ca2+ pools to convert quantal and localized Ca2+ release (28Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tortorici G. Zhang B.-X. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29621-29628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to a continuous release from a single pool. This is considered unlikely because such an effect should not result in reduction in the rate of Ca2+ release. In addition, preliminary experiments of localization of IP3R in control and Tg-treated cells suggested that Tg had no effect on the polarized expression of IP3Rs (not shown). Another possibility is that partial depletion of the stores and the increase in [Ca2+] i caused by Tg led to desensitization of the Ca2+ release channels. This explanation is excluded by the findings that treatment with low concentration of ionomycin failed to reproduce the effect of Tg.The combined experiments with Tg and ionomycin strongly suggest that SERCA pumps actively participate in initiation and propagation of the [Ca2+] i waves. This can occur through the regulation of Ca2+ release by endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content (30Missiaen L. Parys J.B. DeSmedt H. Sienaert I. Bootman M.D. Casteels R. Biswas B.B. Biswas S. Subcellular Biochemistry. 26. Plenum Press, New York1996: 59-95Google Scholar) together with the heterogeneous affinity of the compartmentalized Ca2+ pool to IP3 (4Thorn P. Lawrie A. Smith P.A. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar,29Tortorici G. Zhang B.-X. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29621-29628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initiation sites are determined by high regions of IP3R expression (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29621-29628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High local levels of [Ca2+] i during Ca2+ release events allow Ca2+ uptake by SERCA pumps into adjacent pools to increase their affinity for IP3 (30Missiaen L. Parys J.B. DeSmedt H. Sienaert I. Bootman M.D. Casteels R. Biswas B.B. Biswas S. Subcellular Biochemistry. 26. Plenum Press, New York1996: 59-95Google Scholar) and trigger a second event of Ca2+release. By inhibiting the SERCA pumps Tg prevents the propagation of the Ca2+ wave. At low [ionomycin] the [Ca2+] i increase adjusts to the site of [Ca2+] i release is sufficiently high to allow Ca2+ uptake by SERCA pumps at this region and propagation of the Ca2+ wave.The most problematic aspect of the mechanism described above is that we could not find Ca2+ release channels in any part of the cells, except underneath the luminal and lateral membranes and in the nuclear envelope (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how [Ca2+] i increases uniformly in all parts of the cells without redistribution of Ca2+ release channels. We do not have an immediate explanation for this problem. It is possible that the epithelial cells studied express very low levels of Ca2+ release channels in all regions outside the LP below the detection sensitivity of the antibodies employed. It is also possible that Ca2+ is released only in the cell periphery and that Ca2+ diffusion is faster than Ca2+release in Tg-treated cells. In this case the upper limit of Ca2+ diffusion rate should be close to but below the rate of the Ca2+ wave in control cells, which is about 16.5 μm/s (Table I).Localization of Ca2+ transporters and measurements of [Ca2+] i waves in the present, and the preceding manuscript (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) demonstrates the specialized nature of the LP just underneath the luminal membrane in epithelial cells. It is likely that the high levels of PMCA in the luminal membrane, SERCA pumps, and Ca2+ release channels in the LP form complexes of Ca2+ transporters capable of controlling Ca2+in specific regions of the LP. These findings allow us to extend our proposal of compartmentalized Ca2+ signaling complexes in acinar cells (6Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31). We now believe that Ca2+ signaling complexes include the receptor, G protein, phospholipase C, and a PMCA, which are in close proximity and communication with specific portion of the endoplasmic reticulum containing specific SERCA pumps and a combination of Ca2+ release channels. These complexes can operate autonomously to induce [Ca2+] i oscillations confined to part of the LP or communicate with neighboring complexes to trigger Ca2+ waves along the cell periphery. The agonist-evoked Ca2+ signal is governed by the coordinated action of Ca2+ channels and Ca2+pumps (1Muallem S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 351-368PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years it has become clear that [Ca2+] i changes occur in the form of elemental events emanating in specialized microdomains and propagating as Ca2+ waves (see reviews in Ref. 2Cell Calcium (Special Issue)Cell CalciumVol. 20, number 2Berridge, M. J. (ed) (1996) Cell Calcium (Special Issue), Vol. 20, number 2.Google Scholar). Such behavior was also described in pancreatic acinar cells (3Kasai H. Li Y.X.

In the preceding manuscript (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) we showed similar phenomena in SMG acinar and duct cells. Characterization and localization of Ca2+release channels in the three cell types (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) suggests that the channels determine the initiation site and pattern of the [Ca2+] i waves. Thus, the cells express all three types of IP3R and the SMG cells also express the ryanodine receptor. Expression of the receptors appears to be confined to the area just underneath the luminal and lateral membranes (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The type of Ca2+ pumps expressed in each cell type and their role in control of the [Ca2+] i wave is not known. Functional studies showed the presence of PMCA in pancreatic acini (8Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Loessberg P. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tepikin A.V. Voronina S.G. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3569-3572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is activated by agonist stimulation (8Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Loessberg P. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In several studies isolated membranes and vesicles were used to localize the PMCA in the basolateral membrane of these cells (10Muallem S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, a recent study in which external [Ca2+] was measured suggested that Ca2+ pumping across the luminal membrane dominates Ca2+ efflux in stimulated acinar cells (11Belan P.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7615-7619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This predicts that the luminal membrane expresses high levels of PMCA. As in many cell types, Tg and other inhibitors of SERCA pumps release Ca2+ from internal stores of pancreatic acinar and SMG cells (8Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Loessberg P. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Again, the use of isolated endoplasmic reticulum vesicles shows the presence of Tg-sensitive Ca2+ pumping activity in pancreatic acinar cells (10Muallem S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). More recently an Ab raised against a C-terminal sequence of SERCA2b recognized two proteins of 111 and 97 kDa in pancreatic acini (14Dormer R.L. Capurro D.E. Morris R. Webb R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whether the cells express other SERCA isoforms and the localization of the SERCA pumps in pancreatic acini or SMG cells is not known. In the present work we used WB analysis, immunocytochemistry, and rapid [Ca2+] i imaging to identify, localize, and study the function of the PMCA and SERCA pumps in controlling the Ca2+ wave. Clear cell-specific and polarized expression of PMCA, SERCA2b, SERCA3, and SERCA2a were observed. Despite the high level of expression of PMCA in the luminal membrane, [Ca2+] i reduction in all parts of the cells occurred in the same rate. Completely unexpected was the finding that inhibition of the SERCA pumps with Tg abolished the initiation sites and led to a uniform and slow elevation in [Ca2+] i during agonist stimulation. These findings suggest a prominent role of the SERCA pumps in controlling the initiation site and propagation of the Ca2+ wave.

https://openalex.org/W1980664012,"The utility of the baculovirus cell expression system for investigating Ca2+-ATPase and phospholamban regulatory interactions was examined. cDNA encoding the canine cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic Ca2+-ATPase pump (SERCA2a) was cloned for the first time and expressed in the presence and absence of phospholamban in Spodoptera frugiperda(Sf21) insect cells. The recombinant Ca2+ pump was produced in high yield, contributing 20% of the total membrane protein in Sf21 microsomes. At least 70% of the expressed pumps were active. Co-expression of wild-type, pentameric phospholamban with the Ca2+-ATPase decreased the apparent affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+, but had no effect on the maximum velocity of the enzyme, similar to phospholamban's action in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. To investigate the importance of the oligomeric structure of phospholamban in ATPase regulation, SERCA2a was co-expressed with a monomeric mutant of phospholamban, in which leucine residue 37 was changed to alanine. Surprisingly, monomeric phospholamban suppressed SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity more strongly than did wild-type phospholamban, demonstrating that the pentamer is not essential for Ca2+ pump inhibition and that the monomer is the more active species. To test if phospholamban functions as a Ca2+ channel, Sf21 microsomes expressing either SERCA2a or SERCA2a plus phospholamban were actively loaded with Ca2+ and then assayed for unidirectional45Ca2+ efflux. No evidence for a Ca2+ channel activity of phospholamban was obtained. We conclude that the phospholamban monomer is an important regulatory component inhibiting SERCA2a in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, and that the channel activity of phospholamban previously observed in planar bilayers is not involved in the mechanism of ATPase regulation.

Phospholamban is a pentameric transmembrane phosphoprotein regulator of the Ca2+-transport ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (1Tada M. Kadoma M. Bioessays. 1989; 10: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1834-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the dephosphorylated state, phospholamban inhibits the Ca2+ pump by decreasing the apparent affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+ (3Tada M. Yamada M. Kadoma M. Inui M. Ohmori F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 46: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the Ca2+ pump is relieved by phosphorylation of phospholamban at serine 16 or threonine 17 or by the binding of a phospholamban monoclonal antibody to this cytoplasmic phosphorylation domain, resulting in a substantial increase in Ca2+transport into cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles at low ionized Ca2+ concentration (5Simmerman H.K.B.

Purified phospholamban also forms Ca2+ channels in lipid bilayers (8Kovacs R.J. Nelson M.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18364-18368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the functional role of this channel activity is ill defined (9Arkin I.T. Rothman M. Ludlam C.F.C. Aimoto S. Engelman D.M. Rothschild K.J. Smith S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of phospholamban is demonstrated by recent work with cardiomyocytes (7Sham J.S.K. Jones L.R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1344-H1349PubMed Google Scholar) and phospholamban knockout mice (10Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), where it was shown that ablation of phospholamban regulatory function greatly augments the intracellular Ca2+ transient and myocardial contractility, and at the same time attenuates the cardiac response to β-adrenergic agents such as isoproterenol. To understand the molecular mechanism of phospholamban regulation, several mammalian cell expression systems have recently been developed in which phospholamban and the Ca2+-ATPase are co-expressed after transient transfection of cells with plasmid expression vectors (11Fujii J.

These studies have provided useful insights into the mechanism of phospholamban inhibition, including identification of some of the amino acid residues of phospholamban required for Ca2+ pump regulation (14Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cell expression systems used to date have several drawbacks, including low transfection efficiencies, low expression levels, and low membrane yields, making detailed biochemical and kinetic characterizations with use of these systems difficult (11Fujii J.

In the work described here, we have examined the utility of the baculovirus cell expression system for investigating phospholamban and Ca2+-ATPase regulatory interactions. An important strength of this system is that virtually all of the insect cells are infected using viral expression vectors, ensuring that very high levels of foreign protein expression are achieved (15O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). We recently reported on the use of this system for the expression and mass purification of canine cardiac phospholamban and several of its protein mutants from Sf21 1The abbreviations used are: Sf21 cells,Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA2a, cardiac SERCA isoform; SERCA1a, adult fast twitch skeletal muscle isoform; SERCA3, ubiquitous SERCA isoform; L37A-PLB, canine phospholamban with leucine residue 37 in the transmembrane domain replaced by alanine; K Ca value, ionized Ca2+ concentration giving half-maximal activation of the Ca2+ pump; WTV, wild-type virus. 1The abbreviations used are: Sf21 cells,Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA2a, cardiac SERCA isoform; SERCA1a, adult fast twitch skeletal muscle isoform; SERCA3, ubiquitous SERCA isoform; L37A-PLB, canine phospholamban with leucine residue 37 in the transmembrane domain replaced by alanine; K Ca value, ionized Ca2+ concentration giving half-maximal activation of the Ca2+ pump; WTV, wild-type virus. cells (16Reddy L.G.

Here, we report on the further development of this system for functional co-expression of phospholamban with the canine cardiac Ca2+ pump (SERCA2a). Microsomes isolated from infected Sf21 cells exhibit high levels of ATP hydrolysis and active Ca2+ transport, and, furthermore, cardiac-like coupling between phospholamban and SERCA2a is retained. With the baculovirus system, we also demonstrate that a monomer-forming mutant of phospholamban (17Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

No evidence for a Ca2+channel activity of phospholamban was obtained. [γ-32P]ATP,45CaCl2, and 125I-labeled protein A were purchased from DuPont NEN. Nucleic acid-synthesizing and -modifying enzymes were obtained from Promega. Sf21 cells were purchased from Invitrogen, and the BaculoGoldTM system was obtained from Pharmingen. A canine cardiac λgt10 cDNA library (21Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was screened in duplicate with 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide probes corresponding to base pairs 1–33 and 2935–2970 of rabbit SERCA2a cDNA (22MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). SERCA2a cDNA encoding the full-length canine cardiac Ca2+ pump was excised from λ phage genomic DNA using EcoRI and subcloned into theEcoRI polylinker site of pBluescript. The SERCA2a cDNA clone contained approximately 250 base pairs of 5′-untranslated sequence, a 2991-base pair open reading frame, and approximately 850 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence, which included a 39-base pair poly(A) tail. The entire protein coding region of the canine SERCA2a cDNA was sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy method (21Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type phospholamban and L37A-PLB were expressed in Sf21 insect cells as recently described (16Reddy L.G. Jones L.R.

To express canine SERCA2a in Sf21 cells, the XmaI insert encoding the Ca2+pump was excised from pBluescript and inserted into the XmaI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (15O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). ThisXmaI insert contained the entire protein coding region of the Ca2+ pump, 90 base pairs of 5′-untranslated sequence, and the entire 3′-untranslated region including 11 base pairs excised from the pBluescript polylinker. Recombinant baculovirus containing the canine SERCA2a cDNA was obtained after co-transfection of Sf21 cells with pVL1393 and linearized baculovirus DNA using the BaculoGoldTM system (17Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ pump and phospholamban were expressed in Sf21 insect cells grown in suspension (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) at 27 °C in Grace's insect cell medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. Microsomes were isolated from insect cells harvested 48 h after infection with baculoviruses. For expression of the Ca2+ pump alone, a multiplicity of infection of 10 (viruses per cell) was used. For co-expression of the Ca2+ pump and phospholamban, a multiplicity of infection of 15 was used for SERCA2a, and of 5 for wild-type phospholamban and L37A-PLB. Virus-infected Sf21 cells in 600 ml of suspension (9 × 108 cells) were sedimented, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 50 ml of medium containing 10 mmNaHCO3, 0.2 mm CaCl2, plus the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), and Pefabloc (0.1 mm), which were included throughout the entire preparative procedure. Cells were disrupted by N2 cavitation using a Parr Cell Disruption Bomb 4635 (Parr Instruments, Moline, IL), and cellular homogenates were diluted into an equal volume of ice-cold medium containing 500 mm sucrose, 300 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, and 60 mm histidine (pH 7.4). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were recovered, diluted with 0.25 volume of 3m KCl, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were again recovered and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were washed in 250 mm sucrose, 600 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 30 mm histidine (pH 7.4) and sedimented as before. Final pellets (Sf21 microsomes) were resuspended at approximately 5 mg/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 30 mmhistidine (pH 7.4) and stored in small aliquots at −40 °C. The average yield per 600 ml of infection was 40 mg of microsomal protein. Ca2+ uptake was measured radiometrically using the Millipore filtration technique, and ATPase activity was determined by measuring release of Pi from ATP colorimetrically (23Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.W. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were conducted at 37 °C with 100 μg of Sf21 microsomal protein in 1 ml of reaction medium consisting of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm ATP, 10 mm oxalate, 5 mmNaN3, with 2 mm EGTA and 0.20 to 1.8 mm CaCl2 (containing tracer amounts of radioactive 45Ca) to give the desired ionized Ca2+ concentrations, determined as described previously (23Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.W. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake was terminated at selected times by vacuum filtering 10 μg of membrane protein through glass-fiber filters, which were washed twice with 5 ml of 150 mm NaCl.45Ca2+ accumulated inside membrane vesicles was monitored by liquid scintillation counting. ATPase activity was terminated at selected times by adding 50 μl of reaction medium to 300 μl of ice-cold 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Piliberated was monitored by adding 2 ml of malachite green reagent and reading the absorbance at 660 nm (23Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.W. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Basal ATPase activity, measured in the absence of added Ca2+ with 2 mm EGTA, was subtracted from total ATPase activity to yield the Ca2+-ATPase activities reported. Prior to initiating assays, microsomes were preincubated for 20 min on ice with or without affinity-purified anti-phospholamban monoclonal antibody 2D12, at a membrane protein to antibody ratio of 1:1 (4Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.W. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 45Ca2+ efflux from Sf21 microsomes was measured after active Ca2+ loading in the presence of 25 mm potassium phosphate, a Ca2+-precipitating agent that allows ready exchange of accumulated45Ca2+ (24Chamberlain B.K. Volpe P. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7540-7546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ loading was performed at 37 °C with 100 μg of microsomal protein with or without the phospholamban monoclonal antibody in 10 ml of reaction medium containing 50 mm histidine (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, plus 25 mm potassium phosphate and 50 μm added45Ca2+. After membrane vesicles had accumulated approximately 700 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein, efflux of radioactive Ca2+ from the vesicles was initiated by two methods: under conditions in which Ca2+ uptake was stopped completely by addition of 2 mm EGTA, and under conditions in which Ca2+-ATPase remained active, by addition of 9 mm nonradioactive Ca2+ and 10 mmEGTA (2 μm ionized Ca2+ concentration) to give a 180-fold dilution of the radioactive Ca2+ in the medium. Ca2+ load remaining within the microsomes was monitored at selected times by vacuum filtering 10 μg of protein through glass-fiber filters, which were washed once with 5 ml of 150 mm NaCl. As a control, calcium efflux was also initiated by adding 3 μg/ml of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Prior to electrophoresis, microsomal proteins were solubilized at 37 °C for 5 min in dissociation medium that contained 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 5% glycerol, 5% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue. SDS-PAGE was conducted by the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar) using 7.5–15% polyacrylamide (see Fig. 2) or by the method of Porzio and Pearson (26Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M.

Nitrocellulose sheets were probed with anti-SERCA2a monoclonal antibody 2A7-A1 for detection of cardiac Ca2+ pumps or with monoclonal antibody 2D12 for detection of phospholamban (28Movsesian M.A. Karimi M.

Purification of recombinant canine phospholamban from Sf21 cells was conducted as described elsewhere (16Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol.

The Ca2+-ATPase was purified from canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles by 2A7-A1 monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography, using the methodology described by Reddy et al. (16Reddy L.G.

Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Most of the detailed biochemical work characterizing phospholamban and Ca2+-ATPase regulatory interactions has been conducted with sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations isolated from dog heart (1Tada M. Kadoma M. Bioessays. 1989; 10: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Tada M. Yamada M. Kadoma M. Inui M. Ohmori F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 46: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These well characterized preparations are enriched in the two proteins and are prepared in relatively high yield (27Jones L.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Fleming J.W. McConnaughey M.M. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 530-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has greatly facilitated the biochemical studies. Ironically, however, the canine cardiac Ca2+ pump has not been cloned or expressed to date. Therefore, to express canine SERCA2a in Sf21 cells, we first had to obtain the cDNA clone for this isoform. The SERCA2a cDNA clone was isolated and found to contain a 2991 base pair open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 997 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 109,619. The deduced amino acid sequence of dog SERCA2a displays 98–99% identity with mammalian SERCA2a Ca2+-ATPases cloned from human (29Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Separation of the microsomal membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining revealed the abundant expression of an 110-kDa protein, which migrated with identical mobility as the Ca2+ pump in canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (Fig. 2 A). The expressed protein was not visible in microsomes obtained from control (i.e. wild-type virus-infected) Sf21 cells. The identity of the expressed protein as the Ca2+ pump was confirmed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody recognizing SERCA2a (28Movsesian M.A. Karimi M. Green K. Jones L.R. Circulation. 1994; 90: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that the recombinant Ca2+ pump is expressed in Sf21 cell microsomes at levels approaching those of the native Ca2+-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Quantitative immunoblotting using the purified canine cardiac Ca2+-ATPase as a standard revealed that the recombinant Ca2+ pump accounted for 20–25% of the total protein of Sf21 microsomes (data not shown), similar to Ca2+ pump content reported in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (34Voss J.C. Mahaney J.E. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1787-1795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus Sf21 cells infected with the SERCA2a-encoding baculovirus readily express the full-length Ca2+ pump. To confirm the functional integrity of recombinant SERCA2a, Ca2+ transport assays were conducted with microsomal membranes isolated after N2 cavitation of Sf21 cells. When assayed at the saturating Ca2+ concentration of 1 μm, the Ca2+ transport rate was increased 10-fold in Sf21 microsomes expressing SERCA2a compared with control microsomes, confirming that the recombinant Ca2+ pump was indeed functional (Fig. 3 A). The Ca2+ transport rate and the maximal level of Ca2+ accumulation achieved was similar to that previously observed with use of canine cardiac microsomes (46Jones L.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+activation of Ca2+ transport was found to be half-maximal at approximately 0.1 μm ioniz"

In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which Y. enterocoliticaprevents macrophage tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) production. Murine J774A.1 macrophages responded to Y. enterocoliticainfection by rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). However, after initial activation, the virulent Y. enterocolitica strain harboring the Y. enterocolitica virulence plasmid caused a substantial decrease in ERK1/2 and p38 tyrosine phosphorylation. Simultaneously, the virulent Y. enterocolitica strain gradually suppressed phosphorylation of the transcription factors Elk-1, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), and c-Jun, indicating time-dependent inhibition of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK kinase activities, respectively. Analysis of different Y. enterocolitica mutants revealed that (i) MAPK inactivation parallels the inhibition of TNFα release, (ii) the suppressor effect on TNFα production, which originates from the lack of TNFα mRNA, is distinct from the ability of Y. enterocoliticato resist phagocytosis and to prevent the oxidative burst, (iii) the tyrosine phosphatase YopH, encoded by the Y. enterocoliticavirulence plasmid, is not involved in the decrease of ERK1/2 and p38 tyrosine phosphorylation or in the cytokine suppressive effect. Altogether, these results indicate that Y. enterocoliticapossesses one or more virulence proteins that suppress TNFα production by inhibiting ERK1/2, p38, and JNK kinase activities.

Simultaneously, the virulent Y. enterocolitica strain gradually suppressed phosphorylation of the transcription factors Elk-1, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), and c-Jun, indicating time-dependent inhibition of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK kinase activities, respectively. Analysis of different Y. enterocolitica mutants revealed that (i) MAPK inactivation parallels the inhibition of TNFα release, (ii) the suppressor effect on TNFα production, which originates from the lack of TNFα mRNA, is distinct from the ability of Y. enterocoliticato resist phagocytosis and to prevent the oxidative burst, (iii) the tyrosine phosphatase YopH, encoded by the Y. enterocoliticavirulence plasmid, is not involved in the decrease of ERK1/2 and p38 tyrosine phosphorylation or in the cytokine suppressive effect. Altogether, these results indicate that Y. enterocoliticapossesses one or more virulence proteins that suppress TNFα production by inhibiting ERK1/2, p38, and JNK kinase activities. The enteropathogenic Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica has developed strategies to resist the host immune defense. This enables extracellular survival and multiplication of the bacteria in host lymphoid tissue after infection and invasion of the intestinal mucosa. It is becoming increasingly evident thatYersinia sp. evade host defense mechanisms by disrupting key functions of the host cell. This ability is linked to the expression of a set of released plasmid-encoded proteins, termed Yersiniaouter proteins (Yops) 1The abbreviations used are: Yop,Yersinia outer protein; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK is used here in a general sense and includes ERK, JNK, and p38 kinases); ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (also termed SAPK); SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; p38, murine homologue of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae high osmolarity glycerol protein kinase HOG1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PVDF, polyvinyldifluoride; β2m, β2-microglobuline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; ATF2, activating transcription factor 2. 1The abbreviations used are: Yop,Yersinia outer protein; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK is used here in a general sense and includes ERK, JNK, and p38 kinases); ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (also termed SAPK); SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; p38, murine homologue of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae high osmolarity glycerol protein kinase HOG1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PVDF, polyvinyldifluoride; β2m, β2-microglobuline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; ATF2, activating transcription factor 2.

Released TNFα enhances the activation of cells involved in the immune defense (i.e. macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, NK cells, and T lymphocytes) and thus contributes in overcoming bacterial infection. Previous studies already demonstrated that TNFα also plays an important role in limiting the severity of Y. enterocolitica infection (30Autenrieth I.B. Heesemann J. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 181: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the impact of Y. enterocolitica on signaling pathways of mammalian cells, leading to suppression of cytokine release, is still completely unknown. Since LPS itself stimulates macrophage secretion of TNFα, it seems reasonable to assume that Y. enterocoliticainterferes with LPS-stimulated pathways.LPS from Gram-negative bacteria was reported to activate the three different MAPK families, i.e. ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38, in macrophages (31Liu K.M.

The mechanism of MAPK activation by LPS remains unclear (36Wright S.D. Kolesnick R.N. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 297-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the one hand, ceramide seems to play an important role (37Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), since LPS was shown to activate a ceramide-dependent kinase (38Joseph C.K. Wright S.D. Bornmann W.G. Randolph J.T. Kumar E.R. Bittman R. Liu J. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17606-17610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ceramide itself stimulates the JNK/SAPK pathway (39Westwick J.K.

Moreover, c-Raf, the upstream kinase activator of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, was recently shown to be activated by ceramide (40Huwiler A. Brunner J. Hummel R. Vervoordeldonk M. Stabel S. Van Der Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). On the other hand, LPS, through its fatty acid chains, has structural homology with ceramide, and it was suggested that LPS stimulates a ceramide-dependent kinase by mimicking the ceramide molecule (38Joseph C.K. Wright S.D. Bornmann W.G. Randolph J.T. Kumar E.R. Bittman R. Liu J. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17606-17610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, irrespective of the mechanism of LPS-induced MAPK stimulation, it is well established that among MAPKs, p38 plays an important role in LPS-induced TNFα production in macrophages (41Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Stricker J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L.

We thus chose the macrophage-like J774A.1 cell line as a well established infection model to study Yersinia sp.-macrophage interactions (13Bliska J.B. Black D.S. Infect.

Interestingly, there is a nonvirulent Y. enterocolitica strain that is virulence plasmid-cured, thus providing an ideal control for comparison experiments with virulent wild-type or mutated Y. enterocolitica strains (Table I). Here, we report that virulentY. enterocolitica indeed strongly interferes with macrophage signal transduction, resulting in blockade of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK activities. This MAPK inhibition correlates with the suppression of TNFα production but is not required for the inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis and oxidative burst.Table IY. enterocolitica strains used in this studyStrainRelevant characteristicsFormer designationReferenceVirulentSerogroup O8; clinical isolate harboring virulence plasmid pYVO8WA-31444Heesemann J.

Galan J.E. Falkow S. Cell. 1993; 73: 903-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the impact ofY. enterocolitica on macrophage MAPK signaling pathways using J774A.1 cells as an infection model. Infection with Y. enterocolitica was found to stimulate p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways, as detected by tyrosine phosphorylation. By contrast, direct tyrosine phosphorylation of JNK was not obvious, but this has been attributed to the fact that JNK phosphotyrosine cannot be easily detected by immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (56Dérijard B.

Dis. 1996; 174: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Figs. 1 and 3) and kinase activities (Figs. 2 and 4) obtained with LPS and virulent and nonvirulent Y. enterocolitica strains were very similar over the first 30 min. Thereafter, the virulent strain harboring theY. enterocolitica virulence plasmid induced a substantial reduction in kinase activities, as revealed by a decrease in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinases along with their substrates, the transcription factors Elk-1 and ATF2, as well as that of the JNK-specific substrate c-Jun. The fact that the reduction in kinase activities occurred after only 1 h of cell infection can be explained by the delay necessary for the Yops to reach their targets and to exert their effects on the host cell (5Pettersson J.

Med. 1992; 176: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The initial stimulation of the three types of MAPKs followed by selective inhibition with the virulent Y. enterocolitica strain was also observed with macrophages derived from human monocytes (data not shown).A link between MAPK activation and TNFα production induced by LPS has been widely documented (41Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Stricker J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 5740-5749PubMed Google Scholar). Deactivation of the MAPKs p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 induced by virulent Y. enterocolitica, therefore, might be related to its inhibitory effect on macrophage TNFα secretion. Indeed, we found that all investigated Y. enterocolitica strains capable of inhibiting MAPK activities also prevented TNFα production, and reciprocally, all strains inhibiting TNFα release also deactivated MAPKs. This finding strongly supports the hypothesis that inhibition of TNFα release by Y. enterocolitica originates from shortening p38, ERK1/2, and JNK activation by reducing their levels of tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, our evaluation of TNFα mRNA levels by reverse transcriptase-PCR indicated that LPS stimulation and infection with the nonvirulent Y. enterocolitica strain dramatically enhanced the amount of TNFα mRNA, while no accumulation of this messenger occurred after infection with the virulent strain. This indicates that the inhibitory effect of the virulent Y. enterocoliticastrain on TNFα release is probably not due to alteration of TNFα maturation or secretion but rather to a lack of TNFα mRNA accumulation. The absence of mRNA may be due to inhibition of TNFα gene transcription or due to mRNA instability. A role of p38 in post-transcriptional control of TNFα gene expression has been clearly shown by the group of Lee (41Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Stricker J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) using the anti-inflammatory drug SB203580. It is thus possible that the accelerated dephosphorylation of p38 is partially responsible for the inhibition of TNFα synthesis.The fact that not only p38, but also ERK1/2 and JNK, are deactivated by the virulent Y. enterocolitica strain raises the question of their potential role in TNFα suppression. Indeed, it was recently shown that blockage of the ERK pathway by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 prevents TNFα mRNA synthesis induced by FcγR stimulation (58Trotta R. Kanakaraj P. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). No specific drugs for the JNK pathway are available yet. However, TNFα gene expression is stimulated by AP-1 (61Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassali P.S. Nedospasov A.C. Jongeneel V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 62Rhoades K.L. Golub S.H. Economou J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22102-22107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a transcription factor composed of c-Jun and c-Fos, which are activated through phosphorylation by ERK and JNK (63Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Deactivation of p38, ERK, and JNK induced by the virulent Y. enterocolitica strain may thus together contribute to inhibition of TNFα synthesis. The similar time courses of deactivation of all the MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 suggests that yet unidentified bacterial virulence factors might act at a step that is common to the three pathways, i.e. upstream of MAPKs. When investigating this possibility, we found that Raf-1 activity was lowered after infection with the virulent Y. enterocolitica strain compared with the nonvirulent strain. This finding indicates that at least part of the TNFα-inhibitory action takes place upstream of the MAPKs. However, it remains to be determined whether Y. enterocolitica inhibits MAPK signaling cascades via reduction of upstream kinase activities only or whether it also causes dephosphorylation of MAP kinases themselves. It cannot be ruled out that bacterial factors trigger or accelerate the expression of an endogenous macrophage phosphatase, such as the specific MAPK phosphatase-1 (64Hambleton J. McMahon M.

Analysis of mutants with impaired tyrosine phosphatase YopH expression or secretion clearly excluded participation of YopH in the inhibitory effect on MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation and TNFα production. Furthermore, experiments on a mutant with defective secretion of all Yops (LcrD− mutant) demonstrated that indeed one or several released Y. enterocolitica proteins other than YopH mediate inhibition of MAPK activities and TNFα production. Analysis of Y. enterocolitica strains capable of producing individual virulence factors revealed, in agreement with our previous data on granulocytes (16Ruckdeschel K. Roggenkamp A. Schubert S. Heesemann J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 724-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that YopH and YopE confer resistance to phagocytosis and suppression of the J774A.1 cell oxidative burst to Y. enterocolitica; a strain, capable of producing YopH, YopE, and the adhesin YadA, as well as YopD, YopB, YopN, and the V antigen, suppressed macrophage phagocytosis and oxidative burst, in contrast to a strain secreting only the latter proteins, which are necessary for expression, secretion, and translocation of active Yops (2Straley S.C.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5191-5201Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The fact that both strains were unable to inhibit MAPK activities and TNFα production clearly demonstrates that the anti-TNFα effect is not a consequence of the ability of Y. enterocolitica to inhibit phagocytosis and to suppress the oxidative burst. Furthermore, this finding implies that the Yops released by this strain (YopD, YopB, YopN, YopH, YopE, V antigen) are not, or at least not solely, responsible for the inhibition of TNFα production, although such an effect was previously attributed to YopB (28Beuscher H.U. Rödel F. Forsberg A. Röllinghoff M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1270-1277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the V antigen (26Nakajima R. Brubaker R.R. Infect.

Immun. 1995; 63: 3021-3029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that virulent Y. enterocolitica mediates disruption of eukaryotic signal transduction. Moreover, our study highlights a correlation between the inhibition of macrophage TNFα production by Y. enterocolitica and deactivation of MAPK pathways. The virulence factors responsible for these inhibitory effects are released Y. enterocolitica proteins other than YopH or YopE. The cellular target from which the different MAPK pathways are affected seems to be located at the MAPK kinase kinase level, i.e. Raf-1, or upstream. These characteristics point to the Ras superfamily of small G proteins, among which Cdc42, Rac, and Rho appear to be activated in cascade, with subsequent activation of multiple pathways including MAPK modules (68Symons M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Studies presently under way address this question and should provide new insight into the pathogenesis of yersiniosis. The enteropathogenic Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica has developed strategies to resist the host immune defense. This enables extracellular survival and multiplication of the bacteria in host lymphoid tissue after infection and invasion of the intestinal mucosa.

It has 3′-junction cutting activity on bubble substrates and makes the 3′-incision in the human dual incision (excision nuclease) repair system. To investigate the precise role of XPG in nucleotide excision repair, we mutagenized two amino acid residues thought to be involved in DNA binding and catalysis, overproduced the mutant proteins using a baculovirus/insect cell system, and purified and characterized the mutant proteins. The mutation D77A had a modest effect on junction cutting and excision activity and gave rise to uncoupled 5′-incision by mammalian cell-free extracts. The D812A mutation completely abolished the junction cutting and 3′-incision activities of XPG, but the excision nuclease reconstituted with XPG (D812A) carried out normal 5′-incision at the 23rd–24th phosphodiester bonds 5′ to a (6–4) photoproduct without producing any 3′-incision. It is concluded that Asp-812 is an active site residue of XPG and that in addition to making the 3′-incision, the physical presence of XPG in the protein-DNA complex is required non-catalytically for subsequent 5′-incision by XPF-ERCC1.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) 1The abbreviations used are: XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; CFE, cell-free extract; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CS, Cockayne's syndrome; nt, nucleotide(s). is an autosomal recessive disease caused by defective excision repair (1Cleaver J.E.

DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995Google Scholar). XP patients are hypersensitive to sunlight and develop actinic keratoses and skin cancer at a high incidence and frequency. In addition, XP individuals with severe repair defects develop sensorineural and motor neurological symptoms. It has been shown that mutations in seven genes (XPA through XPG) cause XP. Recently, the proteins encoded by these genes (with the exception of XPE) have been purified, and it has been established that six repair factors that include these gene products are necessary and sufficient for carrying out dual incisions that remove damage such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts from DNA. These six repair factors are XPA, RPA, TFIIH (five polypeptides including XPB and XPD), XPC-HHR23B, XPF-ERCC1, and XPG (3Mu D. Park C-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

CS individuals are characterized by photosensitivity, arrested growth and development, and neurological abnormalities. Mutations in five genes cause Cockayne's syndrome: CSA,CSB, XPB, XPD, and XPG (5Thompson L.H. DNA Damage and Repair—Biochemistry, Genetics, and Cell Biology.in: Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997Google Scholar). Of these, the proteins encoded by CSA and CSB are required for coupling transcription to repair (6Venema J. Mullenders L.H.F.

A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and the XPB and XPD proteins are subunits of the general transcription factor TFIIH (7Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V.

The only gene associated with Cockayne's syndrome but with no known function in transcription is XPG, and for this reason, characterization of the XPG protein is of considerable interest. The XPG protein is a member of the FEN-1 family of structure-specific endonucleases (9Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These enzymes incise DNA at a junction of single-stranded to double-stranded DNA such as those found in “flap,” bubble, and loop structures (9Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20862-20869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of FEN-1 family nucleases and procaryotic nucleases including the 5′ to 3′- exonuclease domain of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I revealed two regions of high homology (14Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and within these two regions, eight amino acids were conserved in all members of the family. Site-directed mutagenesis of FEN-1 revealed that three aspartate residues (Asp-34, Asp-86, and Asp-181) were essential for catalysis (14Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To find out if the corresponding residues perform a similar function in XPG, we mutagenized Asp-77 (Asp-86 of FEN-1) and Asp-812 (Asp-181 of FEN-1) and characterized the mutants. We found that the D77A mutation has only a modest effect on catalysis but that the D812A mutation abolishes the nuclease activity of XPG and has a dominant effect when used in competition-type experiments with wild-type XPG. Furthermore, the availability of an XPG active site mutant enabled us to investigate its additional roles in the excision nuclease system. We found that the presence of XPG in the preincision complex is absolutely required for the generation of the 5′ incision by the XPF-ERCC1 junction-specific endonuclease (12Matsunaga T. Park C-H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3833-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, XPG plays a direct role in 3′ incision and an indirect role in 5′ incision activities of the human excision nuclease complex. Mutations were generated in the plasmid pVL1392-XPG (12Matsunaga T. Park C-H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used to construct the mutants by double-stranded DNA mutagenesis: D77A, 5′-CGTCCTATTTTTGTGTTTGCTGGGGATGCTCC (32-mer); D812A, ACCATCACTGATGACAGTGCCATCTGGCTGTTTGGAGCG (39-mer). The altered nucleotides are indicated in italics. Nucleotide changes were introduced using the Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were identified by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing using the Sequenase version 2 kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The wild-type and mutant XPG proteins were expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system. Mutant proteins were purified by sequential chromatography on phosphocellulose P11 (Whatman) and Affi-Gel blue (Bio-Rad) columns, and the XPG protein was located by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining and immunoblotting. The purified proteins were dialyzed against storage buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 17% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C until use. 5′-labeled 90-base pair duplex and “bubble-30” substrates (12Matsunaga T. Park C-H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were used to test the endonuclease activities associated with XPG. The reaction mixture (7.5 μl) contained 2.5 fmol of DNA in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 6.5% glycerol. The reaction was at 37 °C for 90 min, and the reaction products were separated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Quantitation was done using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). A 136-base pair duplex containing a (6-4) photoproduct (T[6–4]T) at nt 68–69 of one strand and32P label at the 5th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the photolesion was used as substrate (16Huang J.C.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Complementation assays with cell-free extracts were performed as described previously (18Reardon J.T. Thompson L.H. Sancar A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the excision nuclease with wild-type or mutant XPG was done using highly purified repair factors and under conditions described elsewhere (3Mu D. Park C-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2415-2418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 4Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar); all of the repair factors with the exception of TFIIH and XPC-HHR23B were recombinant proteins produced either in E. coli (XPA, RPA) or Sf21 insect cells (XPF-ERCC1 and XPG). Repair reactions were performed at 30 °C for 45 min (complementation assay) or for 3 h (reconstitution assay). The reaction products were separated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Analyses of eucaryotic nucleases belonging to the FEN-1/XPG family and the exonuclease domains of procaryotic DNA polymerases led to the identification of eight amino acid residues that are conserved in the entire set (14Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Based on this sequence conservation as well as on analysis of the exonuclease domains of the polymerases, it was predicted that these eight residues may be essential for substrate binding or catalysis, and an elegant study with human FEN-1 endonuclease revealed that the Asp-34, Asp-86, and Asp-181 residues of this 380-amino acid-long polypeptide contribute to the active site of the enzyme (14Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We wished to know if the corresponding residues in XPG are involved in forming the active site of the protein. Toward this goal we made alanine substitutions at positions Asp-77 and Asp-812 of the XPG protein, corresponding to Asp-86 and Asp-181 of FEN-1, two of the three residues most critical for FEN-1 catalytic activity. Fig. 1 shows the wild-type and mutant proteins analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All three proteins are overproduced to comparable levels and behave similarly on chromatographic resins. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the mutant proteins folded properly and that any change in activity would reflect the function of those specifically altered amino acids. Since XPG is a 3′-junction cutting nuclease (11O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 12Matsunaga T. Park C-H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the D77A and D812A proteins were tested for junction cutting activity using a substrate with a 30-nt bubble. Neither the wild-type nor the mutant XPG proteins have endonuclease activity when double stranded DNA is the substrate (Fig.2, lanes 1–4). D77A retains about 75% of the wild-type activity while D812A is totally defective in junction cutting with the 30-nt bubble substrate (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). These results suggest that Asp-77 is not essential for catalysis but are uninformative with regard to the function of Asp-812 since lack of activity could be due to misfolding of the protein, failure to bind to DNA, or absence of catalytic activity. Although these issues can be addressed by a variety of means, we reasoned that the most direct test would be to assay the mutant proteins for DNA repair activity. The effect of mutations at the presumptive active site residues on excision nuclease activity was tested by a complementation assay. Mutant proteins were added to XP-G cell-free extracts prepared from the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line UV135 or the human lymphoblastoid line AG08802. Fig. 3 shows the results obtained with XPG-D77A. As is apparent, this mutant protein complements the excision activity of the XP-G cell-free extract to wild-type level as indicated by the presence of excision products 24–28 nt in length. Thus, it appears that the D77A mutation has near-normal functions with regard both to interactions with other general repair factors and 3′ incision activity as evidenced by complementation of excision nuclease activity in XP-G but not XP-B extracts (Fig. 3 B). In addition, we observe 91–92-nt-long fragments corresponding to incisions at the 23rd and 24th phosphodiester bonds 5′ to the (6-4) photoproduct (17Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In a small fraction of the excision complexes mutant XPG assembles with the other repair factors and apparently fails to make the 3′ incision but enables XPF-ERCC1 to make the 5′ incision, thus generating the DNA fragments that migrate at 91–92 nt (4Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 12Matsunaga T. Park C-H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This uncoupled 5′ incision is specific to XPG CFE supplemented with XPG-D77A as the 91–92 mers are not seen when XPG-D77A is added to XPB CFE (Fig. 3 A, lane 5; Fig 3B, comparelanes 2 and 4). These results suggest that while the Asp-77 residue may be involved in 3′ incision, the D77A mutation does not have a significant effect on this catalytic activity of XPG. In contrast, the D812A mutation completely abolished the excision-complementing activity of the XPG protein (Fig.4 A, lane 5; Fig 4B,lanes 3 and 6). Addition of mutant protein to the CHO-UV135 (XP-G) extract gave rise to 5′-uncoupled incision products (91–92 mers) equal in intensity to the level of excision (coupled incisions, 24–28 mers) achieved with addition of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4 A, lane 5 versus lane 4; Fig.4 B, lane 3 versus lane 2). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with the extract prepared from the human XP-G cell line AG08802 (Fig. 4 B, lane 6 versus 5); however, both the excision signal obtained with wild-type XPG (lane 5) and the band arising from the 5′-uncoupled incision (lane 6) were weak due to poor quality of CFE from this human lymphoblastoid cell line. The high level of uncoupled 5′-incision events is unique to complementation experiments with XP-G mutant CFE and D812A mutant protein as no such uncoupled incision is observed when XPG-D812A is added to a CFE from an XP-B mutant (compare Fig.4 C, lanes 2 and 4). These data show that D812A is in the nuclease active site of XPG. Of greatest importance, our data demonstrate that XPG (in addition to making the 3′-incision) is necessary for assembly of a preincision complex to enable XPF-ERCC1 to make the 5′-incision. Furthermore, these data show that it is the physical presence of XPG and not the 3′-incision that is required for the XPF-ERCC1 complex to make the 5′-incision. The data presented above are consistent with XPG being involved in the formation of a preincision complex that recruits XPF-ERCC1 to the 5′ incision site. However, experiments with CFE do not exclude the requirement for other proteins for priming the preincision complex for XPF-ERCC1 action. Hence, we decided to carry out reconstitution experiments with the active site mutant XPG protein. Fig. 5 shows that the excision nuclease reconstituted with wild-type XPG makes dual nicks almost exclusively (lane 1, oligonucleotides in the 24–28 nt range); in contrast, dual incisions do not occur when the enzyme system is reconstituted with XPG-D812A (lane 2), but a 5′ incision (dependent on XPF-ERCC1; compare lane 3 withlane 2) equal in intensity to the excision seen with wild-type protein is observed. The data are in agreement with that obtained with CFE and support the conclusion that XPG plays at least two roles in excision repair: making the 3′ incision and forming the proper protein-protein interactions to enable XPF-ERCC1 to make the 5′ incision. When normal XPG protein was added to HeLa cell-free extract and incubated with substrate DNA, there was no effect on excision activity. 2T. Matsunaga and A. Sancar, unpublished observation. However, when XPG-D812A was added to the HeLa CFE/substrate mixture, we observed a decrease in the level of excision (dual incision) activity. Concomitant with this decrease in excision was the appearance of and XPG concentration-dependent increase in 5′-uncoupled incision (Fig. 6). Apparently, the mutant protein effectively competes with the wild-type protein in HeLa cell-free extract and replaces the normal XPG protein in a fraction of the preincision complexes with the net effect of reduced dual incisions (excision) and increased uncoupled 5′ incisions by XPF-ERCC1. Nucleotide excision repair in humans is rather complex with 13 polypeptides in six repair factors required for the dual incision event preceding the resynthesis step (3Mu D. Park C-H. Matsunaga T.

Furthermore, in the reconstituted excision nuclease system it was found that omission of XPF-ERCC1 from the reaction resulted in uncoupled 3′ incision, that omission of XPG generated no incisions, and that in the complete reaction, 3′ incision preceded the 5′ incision (4Mu D.

In addition, it was shown that XPG is an essential constituent of the pre-3′-incision nucleoprotein complex (4Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In these reconstitution experiments it was not possible to unambiguously distinguish between two scenarios: 1) 3′ incision by XPG is a prerequisite for 5′ incision by XPF-ERCC1 or 2) that the presence of XPG in the preincision complex enables XPF-ERCC1 to make the 5′ incision. In the E. coli (A)BC excinuclease system, not only the presence of UvrB but also the 3′ incision by this subunit (perhaps aided by UvrC (22Lin J.J. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17688-17692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte R. Goosen N. J. Biol.

Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17693-17700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the human excinuclease has a different mechanism. The presence of XPG in the preincision complex (but not the 3′ nick by this subunit) is a prerequisite for 5′ incision. In fact, because of the absolute requirement for XPG in the dual incision complex for the 5′ incision to occur it is conceivable that XPG is directly involved in both incisions. Although the facts that the active site mutant D812A can promote 5′ incision and that the XPF-ERCC1 complex has 5′ junction cutting activity (12Matsunaga T. Park C-H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that XPG plays an indirect role in 5′ incision, a direct role in catalysis of 5′ incision by XPG cannot be formally eliminated. Since xeroderma pigmentosum is well characterized as an autosomal recessive disease (1Cleaver J.E. Kraemer K.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle E. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1989: 2749-2771Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995Google Scholar), it was of special interest to find that under our conditions the XPG-D812A mutation acted as a dominant-negative mutation with regard to damage removal. A similar dominant-negative effect was observed in this in vitro system with a special XPA mutant protein as well (25Park C-H. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4896-4902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been found that overexpression of an ATPase active site mutant of XPD in a wild-type cell also results in dominant-negative phenotype as evidenced by increased sensitivity to UV irradiation. 3S. Kadkhodayan and L. H. Thompson, personal communication. These data raise the possibility that certain mutations in some of the XP genes would have a co-dominant effect in heterozygotes, assuming that the wild-type and mutant protein are expressed to the same levels. It is possible that careful screening of the XP kindreds would reveal partial repair defects in heterozygotes in a subset of XP patients. Finally, the isolation of an XPG active site mutant described in this study makes it now possible to isolate preincision complexes containing only those polypeptides necessary for making dual incisions upon addition of XPF-ERCC1. Such a complex should be useful in identifying the polypeptides present during the dual incision events and the structure of the DNA prior to the dual incision reaction. We thank Drs. T. Matsunaga and T. Bessho for help in the initial stages of this project and Dr. D. Mu for providing the repair factors and substrate used in the reconstitution experiment. We also thank Drs. T.

Here we present evidence that the ΔF508 mutation affects a step on the folding pathway prior to formation of the ATP binding site in the nucleotide binding domain (NBD). Notably, stabilization of the native state with 4 mm ATP does not alter the temperature-dependent folding yield of the mutant ΔF508 NBD1 in vitro. In contrast, glycerol, which promotes ΔF508-CFTR maturation in vivo, increases the folding yield of NBD1ΔF and reduces the off pathway rate in vitro, although it does not significantly alter the free energy of stability. Likewise a second site mutation, R553M, which corrects the maturation defect in vivo, is a superfolder which counters the effects of ΔF508 on the temperature-dependent folding yield in vitro, but does not significantly alter the free energy of stability. A disease-causing mutation, G551D, which does not alter the maturation of CFTR in vivo but rather its function as a chloride channel, and the S549R maturation mutation have no discernible effect on the folding of the domain. These results demonstrate that ΔF508 is a kinetic folding mutation that affects a step early in the process, and that there is a significant energy barrier between the native state and the step affected by the mutation precluding the use of native state ligands to promote folding. The implications for protein folding in general are that the primary sequence may not necessarily simply define the most stable native structure, but rather a stable structure that is kinetically accessible.

The cellular phenotype of the ΔF508 mutation is a defect in protein maturation and transit to the plasma membrane (10Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Several other CF-causing mutations known to be maturation-defective, including S549R, are located in NBD1 (11Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S. Manavalan P. Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J.

Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Previously we suggested that the defect in ΔF508-CFTR intracellular trafficking was secondary to the diminished ability of the mutant NBD1 to achieve its native, functional conformation (13Thomas P.J. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Thomas P.J. Shenbagamurthi P. Sondek J. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) are consistent with the notion that defective folding is responsible for the defective maturation of the mutant protein and, thus, the lack of functional protein. Alteration of other residues in CFTR-NBD1 and of cellular conditions is known to ameliorate the defective maturation and trafficking defect caused by the ΔF508 mutation. In a German pancreas-insufficient patient homozygous for ΔF508 with typical gastrointestinal and pulmonary disease but sweat chloride in the normal range a second site mutation of R553Q was found on one ΔF508-CFTR allele (15Dork T. Wulbrand U. Richter T. Neumann T. Wolfes H. Wulf B. Maass G. Tummler B. Hum. Genet. 1991; 87: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two mutations at this position, R553M and R553Q, revert the mating phenotype of a ΔF508 STE6-CFTR chimera in yeast (16Teem J.L. Berger H.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. Tsui L.-C. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, introduction of the second site mutations into human ΔF508-CFTR partially corrected the maturation defect, resulting in an increase of functional CFTR at the membrane (16Teem J.L. Berger H.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. Tsui L.-C. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recently two groups have demonstrated that when cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR are grown in the presence of glycerol the maturation and functional defects can be largely rescued (17Sato S. Ward C.L.

Cell Stress & Chaperones. 1996; 1: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Such a result had been predicted with the suggestion that conditions, which stabilize protein structure during the folding process, might restore wild-type function to the ΔF508-CFTR (13Thomas P.J. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Thomas P.J. Shenbagamurthi P. Sondek J. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5727-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously an in vitro folding system was developed to quantitatively investigate the effect of the ΔF508 mutation on the folding of NBD1 (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that ΔF508 in NBD1 was a temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutation, suggesting the mutation altered the folding pathway of NBD1 rather than its native state thermodynamic stability. In the present study we use this system to examine the effects of the R553M second site mutation, the G551D functional mutation, the S549R maturation-defective mutation, glycerol, and ATP binding on the folding pathway and thermodynamic stability of NBD1. These studies provide direct evidence that the defect is on the folding pathway and that manipulations that correct the maturation defect of the full-length protein in vivoalso correct the defective folding of the first nucleotide binding domain in vitro, establishing a causal link between the two observations. Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used to generate R553M, G551D, and S549R mutations in plasmid pBQ2.4 containing CFTR cDNAs. The mutant primers are as follows: R553M primer, 5′-GAAATTCTTGC CAT TTGACCTCCAC-3′ (25 bases); G551D primer, 5′-CTTGCTCGTTGA T CTCCACTCAGTG-3′ (25 bases); S549R primer, 5′-CGTTGACCTCC T CTCAGTGTGATTCC-3′ (26 bases). Production of mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression cassette polymerase chain reaction was employed to synthesize the cDNA fragments of CFTR NBD1-R553M, NBD1-G551D, and NBD1-S549R containing a 5′ NdeI site, a 3′ XhoI site, and a stop codon as described previously for NBD1 and NBD1ΔF (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Digested polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into theNdeI and XhoI sites of the pET28a plasmid. To construct the NBD1ΔF-R553M expression vector, pET28a NBD1-R553M and pET28a NBD1ΔF were digested with SphI. The larger fragment (5140 base pairs) from the pET28a NBD1-R553M plasmid digestion and the small fragment (720 base pairs) from the pET28a NBD1ΔF plasmid digestion were purified and ligated with T4 ligase. The proper construct was verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. The NBD1 proteins were purified from expressing BL21 (DE3)Escherichia coli strains and folded in vitro as described previously (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic stability of the purified NBD1s was determined by extrapolation of the GdnHCl melting profiles (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of the folding yield experiments was determined by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence at 2 μm final protein concentration (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The fluorescence method allows not only the amount of protein to be quantitated but reports on the conformation as well. For the effect of ATP on the temperature-dependent folding of NBD1ΔF, unfolded protein was diluted with buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mml-arginine·HCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 4 mm ATP. An excitation wavelength of 290 nm was used in the presence of ATP to avoid nucleotide-dependent absorption of the incident light. Nucleotide binding was determined from the quenching of protein tryptophan fluorescence upon ATP binding to the NBD1 proteins. Samples containing 1.8 μm NBD1s in buffer B at the indicated concentration of ATP were excited with 295 nm of monochromatic light (2-nm band-pass). Uncorrected emission spectra were collected from 305 nm to 400 nm (4-nm band-pass). The dissociation constant (K d) was calculated by nonlinear regression of the data according to the equation, ΔF=ΔFmax∗[L]Kd+[L]Equation 1 where ΔF is fluorescence decrease and [L] is the concentration of ATP. To determine the rates of formation of off folding pathway species, NBD1s were solubilized in 6 mGdnHCl and rapidly diluted 30-fold with buffer B to a final protein concentration of 18 μm at 23 °C or 2 μmat 37 °C. Under these conditions the folding yields of wild-type and NBD1ΔF are much less than at 4 °C (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Scattered light at 400 nm was measured at a 90° angle or by turbidity to monitor the aggregation progress. In experiments containing glycerol, 10% glycerol was present in buffer B at the time of rapid dilution of NBD1ΔF. The cDNAs for wild-type and mutant NBD1s corresponding to exons 9–12 of the CFTR gene (Fig. 1) were cloned into pET-based expression vectors capable of directing the expression of this domain (Gly404 to Ser589) as a fusion with an amino-terminal polyhistidine tract. The expression levels of NBD1-R553M and NBD1ΔF-R553M are similar to NBD1 and NBD1ΔF (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The expression levels of NBD1-G551D and NBD1-S549R are approximately one-half of the wild-type NBD1 level (data not shown). The wild-type and all mutant proteins form inclusion bodies under these growth conditions inE. coli. The inclusion bodies were isolated, dissolved in GdnHCl, and purified on His-tag affinity resin under denaturing conditions. Densitometry of the proteins resolved by 10% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue indicated that all samples are greater than 95% pure.Figure 3The effects of the R553M mutation on the temperature-sensitive folding of NBD1 and the rate of formation of off pathway conformers.

The constructs of NBD1s are from Gly404 to Ser589 and contain the ATP binding consensus sequences A (GX 4GKT) and B (RX 6–8H4D) and the ABC transporter consensus C sequence (LSXGX 3RX 3A).

The saturable binding of ATP to the wild-type NBD1 is shown in Fig. 2. Upon interaction with the nucleotide the domain changes to a conformation in which Trp496 fluorescence is partially quenched. The fact that the binding is greatly attenuated in the presence of GdnHCl indicates that high order structure is required for interaction with the nucleotide. None of the mutations has a dramatic effect on the affinity of the isolated domain for ATP. The apparent K d of NBD1s for ATP binding are listed in Table I.Table IApparent dissociation constants (K d) of NBD1s for ATPProteinNBD1NBD1ΔFNBD1-R553MNBD1ΔF-R553MNBD1-S549RNBD1-G551DK d (μm)918889878161ATP binding to NBD1s was measured by the decrease of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 2).

Open table in a new tab ATP binding to NBD1s was measured by the decrease of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 2). The K d values were calculated by nonlinear regression of the data. The standard errors are ±10 μm. Fig. 3 A shows the temperature dependence of the folding processes of each of the NBD1s. The data for wild-type and NBD1ΔF were previously published (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and are presented here for comparison. At 37 °C, 63% of the wild-type NBD1 and only 38% of the NBD1ΔF fold into the soluble conformation, whereas 96% of NBD1-R553M assumes the folded conformation at this temperature (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the R553M mutation significantly enhances the folding yield of NBD1. For the double mutant NBD1ΔF-R553M the folding yield is indistinguishable from that of the wild-type. Thus, the second site mutation R553M effectively suppresses the ΔF508 mutation defective folding yield in vitro. The rate of formation of the off pathway conformer was assessed by light scattering at 18 μm protein concentration and 23 °C. A lag phase followed by an increase in light intensity was observed (Fig. 3 B). Significantly the R553M mutation increases the length of the lag phase and decreases the rate of change in light scattering, indicating that the rate of formation of the off pathway conformer is dramatically reduced in this mutant. Once again the double mutant NBD1ΔF-R553M dramatically increases the lag time and decreases the rate change in light scattering in comparison with NBD1ΔF. Two other mutations, S549R and G551D, do not affect the domain folding yield compared with the wild-type NBD1 in vitro (Fig.4 A). In vivo studies indicate that the S549R mutation but not G551D is maturation-defective in the full-length protein (11Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S. Manavalan P. Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3886-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); however, the NBD1-S549R folding yield is not decreased in vitro indicating that it does not act by altering the ability of the domain itself to fold. Moreover, neither mutation affects the rate of formation of the off pathway conformer of this domain (Fig. 4 B). The GdnHCl-induced cooperative unfolding of the domains is shown in Fig. 5. The concentration of GdnHCl required is similar for all NBD1s. TheC m values are between 1.2 m and 1.5m (Table II). The ΔG D of the NBD1s, indicating the domains' thermodynamic stability, can be calculated from this reversible two-state transition (Fig. 5,inset). Compared with the wild-type NBD1, the maximum mutant ΔΔG D,0 is only 1.4 kJ/mol (Table II). In comparison, the ΔG D,0 of the native state wild-type NBD1 is 15.5 kJ/mol. Thus, the effect of the ΔF508 mutation on the stability of NBD1 under these conditions is minimal. The cooperativity of the transition is reflected in them GdnHCl values (the slope of the natural log of the fraction folded versus the denaturant concentration) (Fig. 5, inset). The m GdnHCl values are similar for the NBD1s except for S549R, which has a somewhat larger value indicating that the change in solvent-accessible surface area upon folding is appropriate for a protein of this size. These results indicate that the inability of the ΔF508 and S549R CFTR to transit to the apical membrane and the effect of the R553M suppressor cannot be explained simply by a reduction or enhancement in the free energy of stability of the mutant proteins.Table IIConformational stability of NBD1sProteinΔG D,0ΔΔG D,0C mmkJ/molkJ/molmkJ/mol/mNBD115.51.510.3NBD1ΔF14.4−1.11.311.2NBD1-R553M16.61.11.411.7NBD1ΔF-R553M14.1−1.41.410.1NBD1-S549R16.71.21.213.4NBD1-G551D16.61.11.411.7Reversible denaturation of NBD1s by GdnHCl can be approximately described by a two-state conversion.

Errors in the raw wavelength maxima determination were less than 4%. As shown in Fig. 6, the formation of off pathway species is inhibited by the presence of 10% glycerol. In addition, the temperature-dependent folding yield is increased by this osmolyte (data not shown). These results provide anin vitro explanation for the observation that when glycerol is added to cultured cells expressing CFTR the amount of mutant protein that is successfully trafficked to the plasma membrane is increased. The in vitro results here suggest that the mechanism by which glycerol works is to assist the mutant nucleotide binding domain in its folding. GdnHCl unfolding of NBD1ΔF in the presence of 10% glycerol (data not shown) yields a ΔG D,0 of 14.3 kJ/mol representing a ΔΔG D,0 of 0.1 kJ/mol compared with the ΔG D,0 value reported for the mutant in the absence of glycerol (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of 10% glycerol does not have a significant effect on the Gibb's free energy of stability of the domain. Since the ΔF508 mutant form of the protein is functional when folded, it had been suggested that native state ligands might serve to stabilize this conformation and overcome the folding defect (13Thomas P.J. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Thomas P.J. Shenbagamurthi P. Sondek J. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5727-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently such an approach has been effective in promoting the folding of mutant forms of transthyretin and the CFTR homologue P-glycoprotein (21Miroy G.J. Lai Z. Lashuel H.A. Peterson S.A. Strang C. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15051-15056Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To test this possibility we examined the effect of the natural ligand ATP on the folding yield and off pathway rate of NBD1ΔF. The folding reaction and off pathway reaction were performed in the presence of 4 mm ATP. This concentration is at least 40 times theK D of NBD1ΔF for ATP. Although the binary complex is more stable than NBD1ΔF alone, the presence of the nucleotide did not increase the folding yield or decrease the off pathway rate (Fig.7). An emerging body of evidence indicates that many genetic diseases have their basis in the defective folding of the protein product of the mutant gene (23Thomas P.J. Qu B.-H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). For example, in the case of cystic fibrosis, deletion of a single phenylalanine residue at position 508 in the 1480-amino acid CFTR protein leads to a reduction in the folding yield in vitro (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and of the efficiency of maturation and transit to the plasma membrane in vivo (10Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular pathology of this disease should provide not only a means of developing therapeutic strategies, but also aid in elucidating the relationships between primary structure and the process of folding a protein sequence into its functional three-dimensional structure. The results presented here support our earlier studies which suggested that the defective folding of ΔF508 CFTR is due to alteration of the process of folding rather than to destabilization of the native state of NBD1 (5Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). First, the R553M suppressor mutation effectively corrects the ΔF508 folding defect in vitro but does not significantly alter the free energy of stability. Like ΔF508, R553M may exert its effect on an intermediate formed during the process of folding. In both cases, the results indicate that the mutations are kinetic in nature but with opposite characteristics; R553M is a superfolder, whereas ΔF508 is an ineffective folder. Results in vivo indicate that the R553M/ΔF508 CFTR double mutant only partially corrects the ΔF508 maturation defect, and the fully mature mutant protein is only partially functional (16Teem J.L. Berger H.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. Tsui L.-C. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The current results indicate that the diminished function of R553M observed in vivo is not due to a loss of the ability of NBD1 to bind ATP. Altered function may then be due to deficient catalysis or coupling between the nucleotide site and other parts of the protein. The fact that in the in vitro folding system the ATP binding function of the double mutant is normal and the suppression is complete, as opposed to the partial function and suppression in vivo(16Teem J.L. Berger H.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. Tsui L.-C. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), indicates that although NBD1 folding reliably reports the fundamental effects of the mutations the situation is more complex in the cell, and subtle secondary effects may not always be evident in thein vitro system. For example, the reduction of the folding yield by the ΔF508 mutation is not as pronounced as in vivo, perhaps indicating that cellular mechanisms for identifying malfolded conformers are more efficient than in vitroaggregation. A second line of evidence that the ΔF508 folding defect is kinetic in nature is that addition of the native state ligand has no discernible effect on the folding yield or on the rate of formation of off pathway conformers (Fig. 7). Although not all of the binding energy contributes to the stabilization of the native state, as some is expended to affect the conformational change, the binary complex would be expected to be significantly more stable than the native state in the absence of nucleotide. The fact that the addition of ATP does not increase the folding yield is, thus, consistent with the notion that the intermediate affected by the mutation is kinetically isolated from the native state by a significant energy barrier during the process of folding. The other CF-associated mutations tested here have no significant effects on either the temperature-dependent folding yield or the off pathway kinetics under our experimental conditions. The G551D mutation, which has no observable effect on the maturation of CFTR in vivo (11Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S. Manavalan P. Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3886-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) but rather alters the ability of the mature protein to function (7Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), has no effect on the ability of NBD1 to fold as would be expected. In addition, G551D does not significantly alter the binding affinity of NBD1-G551D for ATP. The effect of the mutation may be due to altered domain-domain interactions or the reduced ability of NBD1-G551D to hydrolyze ATP (7Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Similarly, the S549R mutation, which like ΔF508 inhibits the formation of mature functional CFTR in vivo (11Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S. Manavalan P. Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3886-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), has no discernible effect on the ability of NBD1 to fold (Fig. 4). The S549R mutation may alter a surface important for interaction with other CFTR domains or other proteins during the process of conformational maturation. We suggested previously that alcohols and other compounds that are known to stabilize protein and peptide structures might restore wild-type like folding to the ΔF508-CFTR (13Thomas P.J. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Thomas P.J. Shenbagamurthi P. Sondek J. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5727-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been demonstrated recently that such a compound, glycerol, corrects the defective maturation of ΔF508 in vivo (17Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 18Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress & Chaperones. 1996; 1: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar).In vitro, 10% glycerol inhibits the off pathway reaction and significantly enhances the temperature-dependent folding yield of ΔF508 NBD1. Glycerol does not significantly affect the free energy of stability of the native state. Therefore, its effects may be to stabilize the putative mutationally sensitive intermediate or transition state proposed here, or to inhibit the off pathway association reaction of partially folded chains. Notably, this intermediate is not significantly populated under equilibrium conditions as the denaturation curves fit a two-state approximation. With these results in mind, our previous suggestion for therapeutic ligands should be modified to either the special case of compounds that lower a kinetic barrier by stabilizing a crucial transition or those that specifically interfere with the formation of off pathway species. The results presented here indicate that mutational and environmental effects on the folding of NBD1 of CFTR in vitro in many ways parallel their effects on the folding and maturation of the full-length protein in vivo. As such, this study demonstrates that a defect in protein folding is the biochemical basis of CF. Thus, although commonly referred to as a trafficking defect, the ΔF508 mutation is primarily a protein folding defect with altered protein trafficking or kinesis secondary to altered folding. The distillation of the pathology of CF to a single soluble protein domain is a step toward generating a molecular description of the disease process. In addition, since most cases of CF are due to defective folding and maturation, this information is necessary for the logical design of novel therapeutics directed at ameliorating the disease in humans. The plasmids pBQ4.7 and pCOFΔF508 containing CFTR cDNAs for wild-type and ΔF508 were a generous gift from Dr. J. Rommens. We thank Yu Zeng for technical assistance and Dr. S.

The slyD gene (sensitivity to lysis) was identified by screening for survival of E. coli C after induction of the cloned lysis gene E of bacteriophage φX174 (7Maratea D. Young K. Young R. Gene ( Amst .). 1985; 40: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mutations mapped to the slyD locus (at 73.5′ on the E. coli chromosome) resulted in accumulation of complete phages inside the cells, but no lysis occurred. The slyDlocus was cloned and sequenced. By deletion analysis it was demonstrated that the open reading frame 196 of E. coli is identical to slyD (8Roof W.D. Horne S.M. Young K.D. Young R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2902-2910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The derived amino acid sequence of SlyD was shown to share similarity with FKBPs. Independently, the protein SlyD (there called WHP, wonderoushistidine-rich protein) was discovered by binding to nickel ions immobilized on nitriloacetic acid-agarose (NTA) resin (9Wülfing C. Lombardero J. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Derived from the amino acid sequence, SlyD consists of two sequence regions, an N-terminal stretch of 146 amino acids with 28.1% similarity to hFKBP12 and a C-terminal histidine-rich stretch. Similar regions containing clustered histidine residues are usually present in HypB proteins involved in nickel insertion into hydrogenases (10Fu C. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Only HypB of E. coli lacks this histidine-rich stretch. In contrast to HypB of other species, it is not able to bind nickel ions (11Maier T. Jacobi A. Sauter M. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 630-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A hypothetical protein with a similar structure as SlyD was detected in Haemophilus influenzae (12Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O. Clayton R.A. Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Bult C.J. Tomb J.-F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 180Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) is homologous to amino acids 1–146 of SlyD. A protein, perhaps derived from ORF149 of E. coli, was found earlier after cloning of a 7.1 kilobase insert generated by restriction of the specialized transducing phage λdapB2 with the restriction endonuclease BamHI (14Mackie G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8928-8935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a 17-kDa protein was detected by coupled transcription and translation. After sequencing of thelsp-dapB interval (13Bouvier J. Stragier P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 180Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the 17-kDa protein is coded by ORF149. The ORF149 is part of theileS-lsp operon (15Miller K.W.

Metal ion influence disappears for the N-terminal PPIase fragment of SlyD (amino acids 1–146) lacking the histidine-rich region. Just like SlyD, the related protein product of ORF149 of E. coli (SlpA) shows PPIase activity. All genes or part of the genes were amplified from E. coli strain BL21 chromosomal DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PrimeZyme, Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) and were ligated into the overexpression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed by transformation into competentE. coli M15(pREP4) cells. The cells were selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml kanamycin. The plasmids of the obtained clones were examined by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. In addition, the clones were screened for overexpression of a protein of the right size in small scale cultures. Three h after induction by 1 mm IPTG, the cells were pelleted by short centrifugation, dissolved in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and Coomassie Blue staining (20Choi J.-K. Yoon S.-H. Hong H.-Y. Choi D.-K. Yoo G.-S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236 (2nd Ed.): 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For cloning of the slyD gene, the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CGCCAGAATTCTTCCCATGCTCAGG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCTGGGATCCGAGAAGTTAAAAGCCAGCC-3′ were used. The obtained fragment was cloned into pQE30 by using the restriction endonucleasesEcoRI and BamHI. For cloning of the N-terminal fragment of SlyD (amino acids 1–146), the same cloning strategy as for SlyD with the above mentioned first primer and the primer 5′-GTGAAGGATCCTCAGCTAATTATTCTTCTTCAGTCGC-3′ was used. Cloning of the ORF149 was achieved by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-CGGCAAAGAATTCTAAATATAAG AGC-3′ and 5′-CGCGAGCTCTCGACCACATAGCG-3′ followed by ligation of the fragment into the EcoRI and SacI restriction sites of pQE30. All DNA manipulations were performed according to Sambrooket al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing of recombinant plasmids was performed by the Sanger method of chain termination using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) and the pQE type III/IV or reverse primers (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany). Overexpression of recombinant proteins was achieved by inoculating 1 liter of medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml kanamycin with 20 ml of overnight culture of the appropriate strain and growing at 37 °C and 200 rpm shaking to anA 600 of 0.5. After induction with 1 mm IPTG, the cells were grown for another 5 h. The cells were harvested at 4,000 × g for 10 min in a Beckman J2-HC centrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) and dissolved in the buffer used for purification on the first column. For degradation of nucleic acids, 0.1% (v/v) benzonase was added. The cell suspension was passed 3 times through a French press cell (SLM Aminco, Buettelborn, Germany) at 20,000 p.s.i. After the removal of membrane debris by centrifugation at 95,800 × g for 40 min at 4 °C in a Beckman L8 60 m centrifuge, the supernatant was submitted to further purification. For determination of the protein concentration, the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), and the protein bands were visualized by silver staining (24Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) or a modified Coomassie Blue staining method (20Choi J.-K. Yoon S.-H. Hong H.-Y. Choi D.-K. Yoo G.-S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236 (2nd Ed.): 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against SlyD and SlpA were raised in rabbits (PAB productions, Hebertshausen, Germany) against proteins desalted by HPLC as described below. Western blotting to nitrocellulose was performed in a semidry electroblotting system (Fast Blot B32, Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) with a buffer containing 25 mmTris, 150 mm glycine, 10% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3. The membrane was incubated with diluted polyclonal antibodies (1:2,000) for 1 h at room temperature. For detection, the blot was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and developed with 0.018% 4-chloro-1-naphthol in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.024% hydrogen peroxide, pH 6.0. SlyD was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a 0–100 mm imidazole gradient in 100 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, pH 8.0. After dialysis against 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, an anion exchange chromatography on Fractogel EMD DEAE-650(M) was performed. The SlyD containing fractions were saturated to 30% with ammonium sulfate and applied on a propyl-Sepharose column. The protein was eluted with a gradient of 30–0% saturation ammonium sulfate and dialyzed thoroughly against 10 mm MOPS, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.0. After that the protein was enriched on a DEAE column. About 1 mg of homogeneous SlyD was desalted by HPLC and used to generate antibodies in rabbit. All protein preparations were performed at 4 °C. Purification was examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The N-terminal fragment of SlyD was purified by applying the bacterial lysate on a Fractogel EMD DEAE-650(M) column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The protein eluted with a 0–2 m NaCl gradient and was passed in the same buffer through a column packed with chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Beforehand, the column was loaded with NiSO4 and washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The protein fraction, which did not bind to the column, was dialyzed in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, and passed through a Fractogel TSK AF-Blue column in the same buffer. The protein solution was concentrated on a Filtron Omegacell (exclusion size 10,000 Da). Samples of 1 ml were submitted to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 16/60 HiLoad FPLC column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.8. After dialysis against 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, the appropriate fractions were applied in dialysis buffer on an EMD DEAE-650(M) column. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0–2 m NaCl. Purification of SlpA was achieved by anion exchange chromatography on Fractogel EMD DEAE-650(M) with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The protein eluted with a linear gradient from 0–2 m NaCl and was passed through a chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column loaded with NiSO4 and equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. After concentration on a Filtron Omegacell (exclusion size 10,000 Da) the protein was submitted to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column, equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.8. The protein was dialyzed against 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, and passed through a Fractogel TSK AF-Blue column. The protease coupled assay of Fischer et al. (1Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) for determination of PPIase activity was used. Before any measurements were carried out, the protease stability of the possible PPIases was examined. About 100 μg/ml homogenous protein was incubated for either 20 s or 2 min in 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, at 10 °C with chymotrypsin (30 μm), subtilisin (2 μm), thrombin (60 μm), and trypsin (0.5 μm). The reaction was stopped by adding the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm final concentration) and boiling sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For the determination of PPIase activity either 0.5 μmtrypsin or 30 μm chymotrypsin and substrates of the structure Suc-Ala-Xaa-Pro-Arg-4NA and Suc-Ala-Xaa-Pro-Phe-4NA (Xaa = variable aminoacyl residue) were used, respectively. Stock solutions of substrates (10 mg/ml) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. The reactions were carried out in 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, at 10 °C and followed spectrophotometrically at 390 nm using a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array UV/VIS spectrophotometer. 500 data points were used to calculate the first-order rate constants. Inhibition of PPIase activity was measured by adding FK506, CsA, or metal chlorides to the reaction mixture 5 min before starting the measurement. Stock solutions of 10 mm FK506 (gift from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) or 100 mm CsA in ethanol, 1 mm NiCl2, or other metal chlorides (ZnCl2, CaCl2, NaCl, KCl, and MgCl2) in 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, were used. Equilibrium dialysis was performed in home-made cells (26Reinard T. Jacobsen H.-J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) for 12 h in a humid chamber at 10 °C. The lower chamber contained 250 μl of the appropriate NiCl2 solution in 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.8. The upper chamber was filled with 250 μl of SlyD solution (72 μm) in the same buffer. The nickel content of SlyD and buffer samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma AES with a Jenaquant AES 110 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For calibration, 1-element standards (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, as metal-free control have been used. The data obtained by AAS were analyzed by means of the Adair equation (27Adair G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 63: 529-545Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). r=K1[Me]+2K1K2[Me] 2+3K1K2K3[Me] 31+K1[Me]+K1K2[Me] 2+K1K2K3[Me] 3Equation 1 [Me] stands for the free metal concentration, r is the number of metal ions bound per mole of protein, andK 1, K 2, andK 3 are the binding constants of three different sites. The data from the inhibition studies of the PPIase activity of SlyD by NiCl2 were converted to binding data. The specific PPIase activity of SlyD samples without added NiCl2, as these prepared for AES, should equal 0.24 bound nickel ions/molecule of SlyD (as determined by AES for these samples). All other data points were calculated, assuming linear dependence of nickel binding to inhibition of PPIase activity of SlyD. Homogeneous samples of SlyD were applied to a desalting column (Econo-Pac® 10 DG, Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). The protein was eluted with 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. CD spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm with 12.5 μm SlyD. When required, 100 μmNiCl2 (final concentration) was added 5 min before starting the measurement. All measurements were performed in a 1-mm cuvette at 25 °C with a J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan), averaging 20 transients with Jasco software Version 1,33.00. Reversed-phase HPLC separations for antibody production, protein sequencing, and mass spectrometry were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10A modular HPLC unit (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The protein was applied to a C3 column (125 × 4 mm Nucleosil 500–5 C3-PPN, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) in 1% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a 30–60% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min at 40 °C (flow rate 1 ml/min). The molecular mass of proteins embedded in sinapic acid was determined using a MALDI-TOF Bruker reflex mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen-Analytik, Bremen, Germany) with an N2-UV laser (337 nm). Amino acid sequences were determined using an Applied Biosystems 476A gas phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). SlyD was purified from overexpression cultures with a yield of 54 mg of homogenous protein/liter of culture. By silver staining, only a single band could be detected in SDS-PAGE after the last purification step. Amino acid sequencing of the purified protein for 10 steps showed the expected N-terminal sequence MKVAKDLVVS of SlyD (Fig. 1). The N-terminal methionine was not processed. Analysis of the protein by mass spectrometry showed a molecular mass of 20,850 Da, very similar to the theoretical mass of 20,852 Da. The apparent molecular mass in SDS-PAGE was 25 kDa. The purification of the N-terminal fragment of SlyD yielded 9 mg of homogenous protein/liter of culture. The protein did not bind to nickel ions immobilized on chelating Sepharose. In SDS-PAGE, the apparent molecular mass of the N-terminal fragment of SlyD was 18 kDa. Antibodies raised against the complete SlyD molecule were able to detect the N-terminal fragment of SlyD in Western blots. The ORF149 of E. coli was cloned, and the published sequence (13Bouvier J. Stragier P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 180Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was verified. The protein product (SlpA) was purified to homogeneity as shown by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining at a level of 17 mg/liter of culture. SlpA passed through a chelating Sepharose column preloaded with nickel ions. The measured molecular mass of 15,946 Da was in good agreement with the calculated value of 15,949 Da for SlpA if the methionine in position 1 has been cleaved off during processing. With antibodies generated against recombinant SlpA, a protein of the same apparent molecular mass as SlpA was detected inE. coli BL21. In previous experiments using the standard assay coupled with chymotrypsin (1Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), no PPIase activity of SlyD has been detected (9Wülfing C. Lombardero J. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that this is due to a high sensitivity of SlyD against chymotrypsin. After 2 min of incubation with 30 μm chymotrypsin or 2 μmsubtilisin, SlyD was no longer detected in the Western blot. Even after 20 s of incubation, the amount of SlyD was considerably reduced. In contrast, SlyD remained stable for at least two min toward 0.5 μm trypsin and 60 μm thrombin. For that reason, PPIase activity measurements were carried out with trypsin, another isomer-specific protease. For the substrates Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Arg-4NA, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-4NA, and Suc-Ala-Leu-Pro- Arg-4NA, specificity constantsk cat/K m of 29,600, 6,200, and 5,600 m−1 s−1 were measured. After addition of chymotrypsin (final concentration 30 μm) to the reaction mixture, no PPIase activity was detected for SlyD, explaining the failure to detect it in the standard assay. As shown earlier (9Wülfing C. Lombardero J. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SlyD is able to bind Ni2+ and Zn2+ ions. The PPIase activity of SlyD was considerably reduced in a reversible manner by addition of NiCl2 at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 2). Incubation of a sample of SlyD (1 μm) with 50 μmNiCl2 decreased the PPIase activity of SlyD to 10%. The activity could be completely restored by dilution into nickel-free buffer. Other metal chlorides tested (CaCl2, NaCl, KCl, MgCl2) did not affect the PPIase activity up to 1 mm final concentration. However, it was not possible to examine the influence of ZnCl2 due to the inactivation of trypsin in the protease coupled assay. The PPIase activity of SlyD was inhibited neither by 25 μm FK506 nor by 100 μm CsA, otherwise typical inhibitors of PPIases, in the reaction mixture. The PPIase activity of the N-terminal fragment of SlyD measured using trypsin-mediated cleavage of the substrates Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Arg-4NA, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-4NA, and Suc-Ala-Leu-Pro-Arg-4NA was found to be 18,600, 3,900, and 3,600m−1 s−1, respectively. This activity was also not inhibited by 25 μm FK506 or 100 μm CsA. No inhibition of PPIase activity was detected up to 100 μm NiCl2. The N-terminal fragment of SlyD showed the same sensitivity to chymotrypsin as the complete protein. The purified protein SlpA was tested for PPIase activity in the chymotrypsin coupled assay. In contrast to SlyD, SlpA remained active even after 2 min of incubation with chymotrypsin. The protease resistance was also confirmed in SDS-PAGE. For the substrate Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-4NA, a specificity constantk cat/K m of 7,400m−1 s−1 was determined. The substrate specificity in comparison with other PPIases from E. coli is summarized in Table I. The PPIase activity of SlpA was also measured with trypsin and the substrate Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Arg-4NA and was found to be 6,000m−1 s−1. FK506 up to 25 μm, CsA up to 100 μm, and NiCl2up to 100 μm did not decrease the PPIase activity of SlpA.Table ISubstrate specificity of SlpA in comparison with other PPIases of E. coliXaaSlpAFKBP22 (4Rahfeld J.-U.

Open table in a new tab All measurements were carried out in 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, at 10 °C (cyclophilins, 15 °C) with chymotrypsin and substrates of the structure Suc-Ala-Xaa-Pro-Phe-4NA. For calculation of the percentage specific PPIase activity, thek cat/K M value for Xaa = Phe was set to 100%. The data for FKBP22, parvulin, trigger factor, and both cyclophilins were taken from literature. ND, not determined. For interpretation of PPIase activity, the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal fragment of SlyD and SlpA were compared with the sequences of trigger factor and human FKBP12 (Fig. 1). The N-terminal fragment of SlyD shows only weak homology to both hFKBP12 (13.7% identity, 28.1% similarity) and trigger factor (15.1% and 27.4%, respectively). SlpA is 33.5% similar to hFKBP12 (18.1% identity) and 27.6% similar to trigger factor (12.8% identity). From AES measurements, 3 bound nickel ions/SlyD molecule were observed (Fig. 3). The binding constants K 1,K 2, and K 3 for the three different binding sites were calculated to be 9.5 × 105m−1, 4.9 × 105m−1 and 4.4 × 105m−1. The K d value was calculated to 1.8 μm NiCl2(inflection point of the binding function). CD spectra of SlyD were recorded without and with addition of 100 μm NiCl2. The molar ellipticity spectra in the range from 190 to 260 nm are shown in Fig. 4. The maximum at 200 nm as well as the minimum at 215 nm were found to be not as intense in the presence of Ni2+ ions as without nickel ions. The shoulder around 228 nm remains almost unaffected. These changes suggest an increase in the amount of β-turn in the secondary structure (28Brahms S. Brahms J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). PPIases were identified within all cell types and organisms, but little is known about their function in vivo. One commonly used strategy for investigation of protein function is the deletion or depletion of the appropriate gene followed by analysis of changes or defects of cellular functions. In E. coli, disruption of the gene encoding FKBP29 (fkbA) does not affect the phenotype (3Horne S.M. Young K.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This may be due to functional redundancy of various proteins localized in the same cell compartment. This encouraged us to analyze two more proteins of E. coli with homology to FKBPs concerning their PPIase activity. Chymotrypsin has been commonly used for isomer specific cleavage of the PPIase substrates in the protease coupled PPIase assay (1Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar). Up to now, no proteolytic inactivation of PPIases was observed during the assay. This may be caused by insensitivity of most known PPIases to chymotrypsin. Another possibility is that the region responsible for PPIase activity remains intact if PPIases are proteolytically degraded during measurement (e.g. for E. coli trigger factor (29Stoller G. Tradler T. Rücknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). For SlyD no PPIase activity was detected in the chymotrypsin-coupled assay. Therefore, an assay with trypsin, another isomer specific protease, was performed. On the basis ofk cat/K m the PPIase activity of SlyD is considerably smaller than found for other PPIases with the same substrate (for Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-4NA: SlyD 6, 200m−1 s−1, trigger factor ofE. coli 499,000 m−1s−1). The protein fragment representing amino acids 1–146 of SlyD was purified without proteolytic degradation and expressed a quite similar k cat/K m compared with the full-length SlyD. This confirms that amino acids 1–146 are an independent structural region of SlyD. The C-terminal histidine-rich stretch of SlyD seems to be dispensable for PPIase activity. However, the PPIase activity of SlyD was inhibited by Ni2+ ions that probably bind to this region of the protein. Because of the reversibility of this inhibition, we do not attribute it to chemical modification. Since the activity of the isolated N-terminal fragment of SlyD was not affected, binding of nickel ions to SlyD may induce structural changes in the C-terminal domain, which in turn influence the PPIase activity of the N-terminal domain. This mechanism may be used in vivo to regulate the PPIase activity of SlyD. SlyD is the only PPIase known so far that is specifically controlled by high affinity metal ion binding. From CD spectra, alterations in the secondary structure of SlyD by nickel ion binding were deduced. These changes could be interpreted as an increase of the amount of β-turns. A turn-stabilizing effect of cations bound to the backbone amide or side chain functional groups has been occasionally observed for peptides (30Perczel A. Hollósi M. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 285-380Crossref Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of SlyD shows homology to histidine-rich regions of GTPases involved in generation of active hydrogenases (HypB). Both the number of nickel ions bound per molecule SlyD (3Horne S.M. Young K.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the calculated K d value for nickel cation binding to SlyD (1.8 μm) are in the same range as the values found in the literature for HypB. For HypB from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (24 clustered histidine residues), binding of 9 nickel ions with an K d of 2.3 μm was detected (10Fu C. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); for HypB from Rhizobium leguminosarum (17 clustered histidine residues), 3.9 nickel ions/monomer with anK d of 2.5 μm were detected (31Rey L. Imperial J. Palacios J.-M. Ruiz-Argüeso T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6066-6073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of GTP by HypB has been found to be essential for nickel insertion in hydrogenases (32Maier T. Lottspeich F. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HypB of E. coli lacks the histidine-rich region present at the N terminus of all other known HypB proteins and is not able to bind nickel but nevertheless exhibits GTPase activity (11Maier T. Jacobi A. Sauter M. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 630-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus possible that SlyD plays the role of a nickel carrier in E. coli because its metal binding domain resembles those from HypB of other species. Thus SlyD could be involved in the generation of active hydrogenases inE. coli. ORFs of H. influenzae, P. fluorescens, E. coli (ORF149), E. aerogenes, and M. jannaschii show high similarity to the N-terminal domain of SlyD (83.6, 54.9, 53.4, and 47.3%, respectively). After detection of PPIase activity for SlyD, similar activity was expected for the SlyD-homologous protein products of the ORFs mentioned. To confirm this, ORF149 of E. coli was cloned into an overexpression system. The purified protein SlpA showed a specificity constantk cat/K m of 7,400m−1 s−1 for the substrate Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Arg-4NA. The substrate specificity of SlpA shows a pattern different from other PPIases of E. coli (Table I). The closest similarity was found to the E. coli trigger factor PPIase except for higher activity with substrates containing isoleucine or tryptophan at P1 position. By Western blotting with antibodies directed against recombinant SlpA, the protein product of ORF149 (SlpA) was now detected in E. coli. This was the first evidence for the expression of SlpA inE. coli. The alignment of amino acid sequences of SlyD, SlpA, trigger factor, and hFKBP12 (Fig. 1) shows that SlyD and SlpA are distinct from FKBPs and trigger factor though a certain degree of homology exists. SlyD and SlpA are 28.1 and 33.5% similar to hFKBP12 and 27.4 and 27.6% to trigger factor, respectively. The similarity between hFKBP12 and trigger factor was calculated to 37.1%. From the alignment and the comparison of specificity constants, the SlyD-homologous proteins seem to be as distinct as trigger factor from FKBPs. Of the amino acids highly conserved in FKBPs, only a few are conserved in SlyD and even less in SlpA (for review, see Ref. 33Kay J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Almost all FK506 binding residues are substituted in SlpA, except for Ala-82, Ile-92, and Phe-100. A Y27F mutation reduced the activity of hFKBP12 by 70% and binding of an FK506 homologue by 80% (34Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This phenylalanine residue is present in SlpA. Of special interest is the amino acid substitution of Gly-29 in hFKBP12 to Val in SlyD and Leu in SlpA. These rather bulky residues are inserted into the possible binding pocket for FK506 (for hFKBP12, see Ref. 35Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1991; 252: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Moreover, both proteins as well as all other SlyD-homologues contain a large insertion before the last β-strand compared with the structure of FKBP (33Kay J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This could explain why the PPIase activity of SlyD and SlpA is not inhibited by FK506. Because of this insensitivity and the distance to hFKBP12 and trigger factor, but high sequence homology between the SlyD-homologous proteins, we presume these proteins to be members of a new subfamily of FKBPs. We are especially grateful to M. Schutkowski for synthesis of substrates and stimulating discussions. Further, we thank A. Schierhorn, for performing the mass spectrometry, and K. P. Rücknagel, for protein sequencing and HPLC."

Several genes involved in GPI anchor biosynthesis have been cloned using complementation of mutant mammalian cell lines and yeasts that are defective in its biosynthesis pathway. However, the gene involved in the second step of this pathway, in whichN-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol (GlcNAc-PI) isN-deacetylated to form glucosaminyl (GlcN)-PI, has not been cloned. In this study, we established a GPI anchor-deficient mutant of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells defective in the second step. Complementation analysis with the known GPI anchor mutant cells demonstrated that it belonged to the same complementation group as the CHO cell mutant G9PLAP.85. Using the new mutant, we cloned a rat gene termed PIG-L (forphosphatidylinositol glycan classL) that is involved in this step. PIG-L encodes a 252-amino acid, endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, most of which is in the cytoplasmic side. This orientation of PIG-L protein is consistent with the notion that the second step of GPI anchor biosynthesis occurs on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum.

In this study, we established a GPI anchor-deficient mutant of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells defective in the second step. Complementation analysis with the known GPI anchor mutant cells demonstrated that it belonged to the same complementation group as the CHO cell mutant G9PLAP.85. Using the new mutant, we cloned a rat gene termed PIG-L (forphosphatidylinositol glycan classL) that is involved in this step. PIG-L encodes a 252-amino acid, endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, most of which is in the cytoplasmic side. This orientation of PIG-L protein is consistent with the notion that the second step of GPI anchor biosynthesis occurs on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Many eukaryotic cell surface proteins are bound to the membrane by a carboxyl-terminal linkage to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DAF, decay-accelerating factor; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); PLAP, placental alkaline phosphatase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase. anchor (1Stevens V.L.

The conserved core of this glycolipid consists of a lipid containing inositol (usually phosphatidylinositol (PI)), a glucosamine, three mannose residues and phosphoethanolamine. At least 50 GPI-anchored proteins with a wide variety of functions have been identified in mammals, including cell-surface hydrolytic enzymes, receptors, adhesion molecules, complement inhibitors, and antigens of unknown functions. GPI anchors are also frequently used in many protozoa and yeasts (3McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). GPI anchor synthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and essentially consists of the sequential addition of sugar components and phosphoethanolamine to PI. Several mutant mammalian cell lines defective in this biosynthesis pathway have been very useful in studying that of mammals. Three complementing mutants (classes A, C, and H) are known in the first reaction, which is the transfer ofN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to PI to form GlcNAc-PI (4Stevens V.L.

Although two mutant cell lines are known in this step (9Mohney R.P. Knez J.J. Ravi L. Sevlever D. Rosenberry T.L. Hirose S. Medof M.E. J. Biol.

All of these mannoses are derived from dolichol phosphomannose (12DeGasperi R. Thomas L.J. Sugiyama E. Chang H.M. Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Waneck G. Sambrook J.F. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.H.

Mature GPI anchor precursors are post-translationally linked to proteins in the ER. Proteins that are to be GPI-anchored have at their carboxyl terminus a signal sequence that directs GPI anchor addition (2Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The signal peptide is exchanged with the GPI anchor by transamidation, forming an amide linkage between the new carboxyl terminus and ethanolamine (21Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19576-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Class K mutant cells synthesize the mature GPI anchor precursors but are defective in the transamidation step (9Mohney R.P. Knez J.J. Ravi L. Sevlever D. Rosenberry T.L. Hirose S. Medof M.E. J. Biol.

Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and gpi8 (24Benghezal M. Lipke P.N. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have similar defects to those of the mammalian class K mutant, indicating that at least two genes are involved in this step. Most mammalian genes involved in GPI anchor biosynthesis have been cloned by means of expression cloning using mutant cell lines. To further elucidate the pathway, it is necessary to create new mutants. In this study, we established a mutant from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that were stably transfected with human decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and CD59 cDNAs to introduce known GPI-anchored proteins. This mutant was of the same complementation group as the mutant G9PLAP.85 (10Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Harreman M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which is defective in the second step of the pathway, the deacetylation of GlcNAc-PI. The new mutant had no background expression of GPI-anchored protein and allowed us to clone a gene involved in this step. The CHO-K1 cell mutant G9PLAP.85, defective in the second step of GPI anchor biosynthesis, and its wild-type G9PLAP (CHO cell transfected with human placental alkaline phosphatase), were as described (10Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Harreman M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells, their mutants and transfectants were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. The Thy-1-deficient murine lymphoma cell lines BW5147(Thy-1−a), S1A(Thy-1−b), T1M1(Thy-1−c), BW5147(Thy-1−e), EL4(Thy-1−f), and S49(Thy-1−h) (25Hyman R. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (all provided by Dr. R. Hyman, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. A plasmid containing DAF and CD59 cDNA was constructed using pME18sf− (a gift from Dr. K. Maruyama) (26Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), pKP-CD59 and SRα-DAF. CD59 cDNA (27Sugita Y. Tobe T. Oda E. Tomita M. Yasukawa K. Yamaji N. Takemoto T. Furuichi K. Takayama M. Yano S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 106: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pKP3 (a gift from Dr. H. Nojima), a modified vector of pcD2, to make pKP-CD59. DAF cDNA provided by Dr. M. A. Davitz (28Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rhee L. Weddell G. Martin D.W. Nussenzweig V. Nature. 1987; 325: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), was subcloned into pME18sf− to make SRα-DAF. A 1500-bpSfiI-SfiI fragment containing the neomycin resistance gene was obtained from pKP-CD59 and ligated into theSfiI site of pME18sf− to make pME-Neo. Next, a 450-bp fragment containing CD59 coding sequence was obtained also from pKP-CD59, which was digested with Asp718, blunt-ended, then digested with EcoRI. Plasmid pME-Neo-CD59 was constructed by ligating this fragment with XbaI-digested, blunt-ended, andEcoRI-digested pME-Neo vector. Finally, a 2900-bpHindIII-SmaI digested and blunt-ended fragment containing Neo and CD59 was removed from pME-Neo-CD59 and ligated intoSmaI site of SRα-DAF. This construct was named pDNC (for pME-DAF-Neo-CD59). A rat cDNA library prepared from the rat C6 glioma in an expression vector pMEPyori (20Ohishi K. Kurimoto Y. Inoue N. Endo Y. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. Genomics. 1996; 34: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Y. Maeda. This library was prepared from oligo(dT)-primed, size-selected (>1.5 kb) cDNA and consisted of about 6 × 105 independent clones. A fragment containing PyT but lacking the polyoma origin of replication was obtained from pdl3027 (29Jat P. Novak U. Cowie A. Tyndall C. Kamen R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1982; 2: 737-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) by digestion with BamHI, subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript II (pBSII) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and then removed byEcoRV/SpeI digestion. The fragment was ligated into NruI/AvrII site of pcDNA I vector (Invitrogen, NV Leek, The Netherlands) to prepare pcDNA-PyT(ori−). Plasmids were transfected into 1.2 × 107 cells suspended in 0.8 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (30Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) by electroporation at 350 V and 960 microfarads using a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad). Complementation analysis with somatic cell fusion and immunofluorescence staining proceeded as described (31Takahashi M. Takeda J. Hirose S. Hyman R. Inoue N. Miyata T. Ueda E. Kitani T. Medof M.E. Kinoshita T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A sample of 440 μg of the cDNA library plasmids was cotransfected with 440 μg of pcDNA-PyT(ori−) plasmids into M2S2 cells (see “Results”) (total 1.4 × 108 cells) by electroporation. Two days later, transfected cells were double-stained with anti-CD59 monoclonal antibody 5H8 (a gift from Drs. M. Tomita and Y. Sugita, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan) in combination with fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Organon Teknika Corp, West Chester, PA) and biotinylated anti-DAF monoclonal antibody IA10 (32Kinoshita T. Medof M.E. Silber R. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 75-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) in combination with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and sorted using FACS-Vantage (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). From the 707 DAF- and CD59-positive cells sorted, 1350 independent plasmid clones were recovered as described by Hirt (33Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) and by transformation into Escherichia coli MC1061. Pooled plasmids were transfected again into M2S2 cells, and the cells were analyzed for DAF and CD59 expression. DAF and CD59 expression was restored in about 10% of the cells. These pooled plasmids were transfected into M2S2 cells and selected again. Plasmids obtained from the sorted cells were cloned into 96-well plates and screened as described (16Takahashi M. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Maeda Y. Nakamura N. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4254-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to identify those that restore DAF/CD59 expression on M2S2 cells. The 3-kb SmaI-SmaI fragment containing SRα promoter and PIG-L cDNA was removed from pMEPyori-PIG-L and ligated into theSmaI site of pBSII-PGK-Hyg (34Kawagoe K. Kitamura D. Okabe M. Taniuchi I. Ikawa M. Watanabe T. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Blood. 1996; 87: 3600-3606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to make pBSII-PGK-Hyg-PIG-L. This construct was transfected into M2S2 and G9PLAP.85 cells, which were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Finally, clones that permanently restored GPI anchor biosynthesis were analyzed. Biosynthesis of GPI intermediates from UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (1 μCi) by microsomes was measured as described (10Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Harreman M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A rat PIG-L cDNA probe, the 0.7-kb SalI/XbaI fragment of pMEEB-FLAG-PIG-L (see below), was labeled with 32P by the random primer labeling method using High Prime (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). To prepare a hamster PIG-L cDNA probe, we synthesized degenerated primers each corresponding to nucleotides 541–563 and complementary to nucleotides 820–842 of rat PIG-L cDNA and amplified a specific fragment of predicted size (302 bp) from reverse-transcribed CHO cell cDNA that was synthesized from total RNA of IIIB2A cells using oligo(dT) primer. This fragment was cloned, sequenced, and radiolabeled. We fused FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co.) as a tag to the amino terminus of PIG-L as follows. We amplified the PIG-L gene from pMEPyori-PIG-L by PCR using a 5′ primer (5′-TGTCGACGAAGTGGTGGGTCTCTTG-3′) containing a SalI site instead of the start codon, and a 3′ primer (5′-AGCAGGTCAGTCAGCCCAGGTCT-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into anEcoRV site of pBSII vector, digested withSalI/XbaI to obtain a fragment containing PIG-L, which was then ligated into a SalI/XbaI site of pMEEB-FLAG-PIG-A (26Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to exchange PIG-A for PIG-L. We termed this construct pMEEB-FLAG-PIG-L. To fuse FLAG to the carboxyl terminus of PIG-L, we amplifiedPIG-L gene from pMEPyori-PIG-L by PCR using a 5′ primer (5′-CAGTTTCAGCGGGTTCAGTTTTC-3′) and a 3′ primer (5′-TTTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTCGCGAGAGCAACTGCAGCGAGTT-3′), with which we inserted an NruI site and FLAG sequences between the PIG-L carboxyl terminus and the stop codon. The PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBSII vector, digested with ClaI/XbaI to obtain the fragment containing PIG-L-FLAG, which was then ligated into aClaI/XbaI site of pMEEB (26Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We termed this construct pMEEB-PIG-L-FLAG. These constructs were transfected into M2S2 cells, which were selected with hygromycin to establish stable transfectants. FLAG-tagged PIG-L extracted from cells with 1% Nonidet P-40 were Western-blotted against biotinylated anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Kodak) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Life Technologies, Inc.), then developed using the Western-Light chemiluminescent detection system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) was detected by Western blotting with rabbit anti-PDI antibodies (a gift from Drs. R. Masaki and A. Yamamoto, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Organon Teknika Corp). Blots were quantified using a model GS-525 Molecular Imager system (Bio-Rad). M2S2 cells stably transfected with pMEEB-PIG-L-FLAG or pMEEB-FLAG-PIG-L were cultured on 14-mm diameter glass coverslips in 24-well plates for 24 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. Thereafter, they were incubated with Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) for 1 h, then stained with anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak), Rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), rabbit anti-PDI antibodies, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Chemicon International). They were mounted on glass slides with Gel/Mount (Biomeda) and studied under a fluorescence microscope (BX50-FLA; Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). M2S2 cells (4.8 × 107) stably expressing PIG-L-FLAG fusion proteins were resuspended in a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, disrupted by means of nitrogen cavitation (50 p.s.i. N2 pressure for 15 min) and a tight pestle Dounce homogenizer, and digested with 2 units/ml DNase I for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 105 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the post-nuclear supernatants were fractionated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation as described (16Takahashi M. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Maeda Y. Nakamura N. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4254-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Microsomes of M2S2 cells (equivalent to 5 × 107 cells), stably expressing PIG-L-FLAG or FLAG-PIG-L were prepared by centrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatants at 105 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by resuspension of the pellets in 1 ml of buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5. These microsomes were incubated with 500 μg/ml proteinase K at 4 °C for 30 min. The proteinase K was inactivated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mm), and then the microsomes were solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40. To confirm the susceptibility of the substrate proteins to the enzyme, the membranes were solubilized with Nonidet P-40 and incubated with proteinase K in parallel. After centrifugation at 105 ×g for 10 min, supernatants were Western blotted with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody, rabbit anti-PIG-L peptide antibodies (against amino acids 111–125) (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan), and anti-PDI antibodies. To establish new mutant cells, we first transfected a plasmid containing both DAF and CD59 cDNA (pDNC) into CHO-K1 cells. After selection in 600 μg/ml G418, cells stably expressing DAF and CD59 were isolated by sorting twice with a cell sorter and cloned by limiting dilution. One colony, designated IIIB2A, expressed high levels of both DAF and CD59 (Fig. 1 A), so we selected it for further study. We mutagenized IIIB2A cells with ethyl methanesulfonate (100 μg/ml) for 24 h. After a 48-h recovery period, cells that no longer expressed DAF and CD59 on their surface were selected using a cell sorter. This sorting was repeated once more before cloning by limiting dilution. Forty-six clones were recovered and 13 were classified by fusion with GPI anchor-deficient murine lymphoma cells of various complementation groups and mutant CHO clone G9PLAP.85. All 13 clones were of the same complementation group as G9PLAP.85, the mutant with the GPI biosynthetic defect in the deacetylation of GlcNAc-PI. The rest of the mutant clones also seemed to be of the same group, because fusion of the bulk mutant cells with G9PLAP.85 did not complement GPI biosynthesis. We termed this complementation group class L (see “Discussion”). One of the clones, designated M2S2, was selected for subsequent study because it had no residual DAF and CD59 staining when analyzed by FACS (Fig. 1 B). We obtained a cDNA that complements the deficiency of M2S2 cells by expression cloning. A rat C6 glioma cDNA library constructed in a vector bearing a polyoma origin of replication was cotransfected with pcDNA-PyT, which lacks this origin of replication (pcDNA-PyT(ori−)) and screened for clones that complement DAF and CD59 expression on the M2S2 cells. We obtained three clones of essentially the same lengths and restriction profiles, which were thought to be derived from the same clone. We chose one for further studies. This clone restored the surface expression of DAF and CD59 on M2S2 cells (Fig. 1, A–C) and human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) expression on G9PLAP.85 cells (Fig. 1,D–F). To confirm that cloned cDNA complements the deficient deacetylation of GlcNAc-PI, M2S2 and G9PLAP.85 cells stably expressing the cDNA were established and the synthesis of GlcNAc-PI, GlcN-PI, and GlcN-PI(acyl) from UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc was measured in lysates prepared from these cells. As shown in Fig. 2, GlcNAc-PI, GlcN-PI, and GlcN-PI(acyl) were synthesized in the wild-type cell lines, G9PLAP and IIIB2A (lanes 1 and 4, respectively), while only GlcNAc-PI was synthesized in the mutant type cell lines, G9PLAP.85 and M2S2 (lanes 2 and 5, respectively), indicating a deficiency in GlcNAc-PI deacetylation. Transfectants expressing the cDNA synthesized GlcN-PI and GlcN-PI(acyl) as well as GlcNAc-PI similarly to the wild-type cells (lanes 3 and 6). Therefore, deacetylation of GlcNAc-PI was restored by expressing the cloned cDNA. Extent of deacetylation in the transfectants (lanes 3 and6) were higher than those in the wild type cells (lanes 1 and 4), indicating that overexpression of PIG-L induced deacetylation activity higher than normal. We thus cloned the target cDNA and termed the gene PIG-Lfor phosphatidylinositol glycan of complementation class L. The PIG-L cDNA consisted of 1903 base pairs and the longest open reading frame spanning nucleotides 391–1149, encoded a predicted protein of 252 amino acid residues (Fig. 3 A) (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. D88364). The sequence around the initiation codon agrees well with the Kozak consensus sequence. A hydrophobicity plot revealed an amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence (Fig. 3 B). This may be used as a signal peptide or alternatively, to attach to the membrane (see below). The Northern blot analysis of PIG-L mRNA in C6 glioma cells demonstrated a major 1.9–1.7-kb message and a minor 4.9-kb message (Fig. 4, lane 1). The cloned PIG-L cDNA may correspond to the major message. To analyze PIG-L mRNA in wild-type and mutant CHO cells, we amplified and cloned a fragment of hamster PIG-L cDNA of 302 bp that encoded a part of hamster PIG-L protein having 88% amino acid identity with rat PIG-L protein. Using this cDNA as a probe, we analyzed wild-type IIIB2A and class L M2S2 CHO cells with Northern blotting (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and3). The wild-type cells had 3.6-, 2.4-, 1.9-, and 1.3-kb messages (lane 2). The class L mutant lacked 3.6-, 1.9-, and 1.3-kb messages and expressed only a small amount of 2.4-kb messages (lane 3). Therefore, defective deacetylation in the mutant is due to PIG-L mRNA abnormality. Since four messages are simultaneously affected in the mutant, it is likely that they are the products of single PIG-L gene. For both C6glioma and CHO cells, total RNA samples did not give a signal, indicating that PIG-L mRNAs are minor components. There was no overall homology between PIG-L and known deacetylases such as acetylornithine deacetylase,N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase, and glucosaminoglycan N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (35Meinnel T.

Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) gave high homology scores with PIG-L amino acid sequence (Fig. 5). The S. cerevisiae open reading frame YM8021.07 encoded a putative 304-amino acid protein with 24% amino acid identity with PIG-L. Human EST W93799 gave a sequence of 87 amino acids that had 52% amino acid identity with a segment of PIG-L near the amino terminus. When the most similar portions were compared (56 amino acids), the identity increased to 73%. They may be yeast and human homologues of the PIG-L gene, respectively. To localize intracellular expression site of PIG-L, its amino or carboxyl terminus was tagged by FLAG and the fusion constructs, FLAG-PIG-L and PIG-L-FLAG, respectively, were stably expressed in M2S2 cells. The fusion proteins were active as shown by complementation of the surface expression of DAF and CD59 (data not shown). The cells transfected with FLAG-PIG-L were fixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100, probed with anti-FLAG antibody, and observed using indirect immunofluorescence. Cell surface and nuclei were not stained, whereas the intracellular compartment was reticularly or uniformly stained (Fig.6 A), suggesting that the ER was stained. The staining profile of FLAG-PIG-L in red almost completely coincided with that of the ER protein PDI in green (Fig.6 B). Therefore, PIG-L protein is localized in the ER. The cells transfected with PIG-L-FLAG gave a similar result (data not shown). To further confirm this, cells expressing PIG-L-FLAG were disrupted and fractionated into the ER, Golgi, plasma membranes, and cytoplasm by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The fusion proteins were detected as a 30-kDa band by Western blotting against anti-FLAG antibody mainly in fractions 3 and 4,"

EC 2.4.1.19), found in several bacterial species, catalyzes the inter- and intramolecular transglycosylation of α-1,4-glucan. Such activity of CGTase on inter- and intramolecular transglycosylation of α-1,4-glucan is called the disproportionation reaction and the cyclization reaction, respectively. It is also known that CGTase catalyzes the transglycosidic linearization (coupling reaction) of cyclic α-1,4-glucan in the presence of a suitable acceptor molecule to produce linear α-1,4-glucan. The cyclization reaction of CGTase has been of great interest since this is the only enzyme that can produce α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrin (CD), which are generally known as the cyclic α-1,4-glucan with DP of 6, 7, or 8. These CDs all have a hydrophobic central cavity, incorporate various inorganic or organic compounds, and form inclusion complexes (1Saenger W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1980; 19: 344-362Crossref Scopus (2034) Google Scholar). Therefore, these CDs are widely used in the pharmaceutical, food, agricultural, and cosmetic industries (2Schmid G. Trends Biotechnol. 1989; 7: 244-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Extensive analyses on various CGTases indicated that all CGTases convert amylose or amylopectin into a mixture of α-, β-, and γ-CD and remaining dextrins; differences, however, were found in their product specificities (α-, β-, and γ-CD ratios). Thus, CGTase is sometimes classified into three types (α-, β-, and γ-CGTase), depending on the major CD produced. Since α-, β-, and γ-CD all have a dimensionally distinct central cavity and different specificity for guest molecules, recent studies on CGTase have focused on trying to understand the mechanism of the cyclization reaction and to find or engineer a CGTase that produces a specific type of CD. Several approaches have been carried out to obtain the structural explanation of the cyclization reaction of CGTase. Analyses of the three-dimensional structure of CGTase have been carried out using several types of CGTases (3Klein C. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

In the case of CGTase from Bacillus circulans strain 251, three active site residues, Asp-229, Glu-257, and Asp-328, which are conserved in all CGTase primary sequences, play important roles for this step of reaction (8Knegtel R.M.A. Strokopytov B.

However, it is less clearly understood how CGTase catalyzes the following intramolecular transfer reaction to produce cyclodextrins. Although α-, β-, and γ-CD are the major products of CGTase, it has been known that trace amounts of larger cyclic glucans (δ-, ε-, ζ-, η-, and θ-CD) were also present in the reaction mixture of CGTase on starch (18French D. Pulley A.O. Effenberger J.A. Rougvie M.A. Abdullah M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1965; 111: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Pulley A.O. French D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1961; 5: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The structures of these larger cyclic glucans are still not well understood, because they seem to be a mixture of cyclic α-1,4-glucans, outer-branched cyclic α-1,4-glucans, and inner-branched cyclic glucans (18French D. Pulley A.O. Effenberger J.A. Rougvie M.A. Abdullah M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1965; 111: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Kobayashi and Yamasaki (20Kobayashi S. Yamazaki M. Denpun Kagaku. 1991; 38: 314Google Scholar) carried out further structural analyses on putative δ-, ε-, ζ-, η-, and θ-CD fractions and reported that the δ-CD fraction contained a large amount of unbranched cyclic α-1,4-glucan with DP 9. However, the proportion of unbranched cyclic α-1,4-glucan in the following fractions decreased dramatically (50% in ε-CD, 25% in ζ-CD, and almost 0% in η- and θ-CD fractions). From this study, it is thought that the presence of cyclic α-1,4-glucan with DP larger than 12 in the CGTase reaction products is unlikely. Recently, however, we found that potato D-enzyme (disproportionating enzyme or 4-α-glucanotransferase, EC 2.4.1.25) catalyzes an intramolecular transglycosylation reaction on amylose to produce cyclic α-1,4 glucans with DP range from 17 to several hundred (21Takaha T. Yanase M. Takata H. Okada S. Smith S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2902-2908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The time-course analysis of D-enzyme action on amylose revealed that large cyclic α-1,4-glucans were preferentially produced in the initial stage of the cyclization reaction, and subsequently converted into small cyclic α-1,4-glucans, although α-, β-, and γ-CD were never produced (21Takaha T. Yanase M. Takata H. Okada S. Smith S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2902-2908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). D-enzyme also catalyzes disproportionating reactions on malto-oligosaccharides (22Takaha T. Yanase M. Okada S. Smith S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1391-1396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transglycosidic linearization of cyclic α-1,4-glucans in the presence of a suitable acceptor (21Takaha T. Yanase M. Takata H. Okada S. Smith S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2902-2908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In all these respects, D-enzyme and CGTase both seem to catalyze the same reaction, with the major difference being the DP of the cyclic α-1,4-glucan produced. Furthermore, we also reported that the glycogen-branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18) from Bacillus stearothermophilus also catalyzes the intramolecular transglycosylation of amylose and amylopectin to produce branched cyclic glucans with DP larger than 18 (23Takata H. Takaha T. Okada S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1600-1606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Takata H. Takaha T. Okada S. Hizukuri S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 295: 91-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From these studies on glycosyltransferases other than CGTase, we are interested in the action of CGTase in producing cyclic glucans larger than CDs. In this paper, we investigated the initial action of CGTase from an alkalophilicBacillus sp. A2-5a (25Kometani T. Terada Y. Nishimura T. Takii H. Okada S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 517-520Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) on synthetic amylose and found that the CGTase also produced cyclic α-1,4-glucans with DP ranging from 9 to more than 60, in addition to α-, β-, and γ-CD, from synthetic amylose in the very early stage of the reaction. Synthetic amylose with an average molecular mass of 30 kDa (amylose AS-30) and soluble starch were purchased from Nakano Vinegar Co., Ltd. (Aichi, Japan) and E. Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. Glucoamylase fromRhizopus sp. was purchased from Toyobo Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). CGTase from an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. A2-5a was purified to a homogeneous state (25Kometani T. Terada Y. Nishimura T. Takii H. Okada S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 517-520Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CGTases from B. macerans was purchased from Amano Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Aichi, Japan) and was used without further purification. The activity of CGTase was assayed using soluble starch as the substrate by measuring the decrease in iodine-staining power as described previously (25Kometani T. Terada Y. Nishimura T. Takii H. Okada S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 517-520Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Amylose AS-30 (8 mg) was dissolved in 200 μl of 1 n NaOH solution then neutralized by adding 200 μl of 1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), 200 μl of 1 n HCl, and 400 μl of distilled water. The solution was used immediately after neutralization. CGTase (0.75 unit/ml) was incubated at 40 °C with amylose AS-30 (0.4% (w/v)) in 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and reactions were terminated by boiling the solutions for 10 min. The reaction mixture containing 20 μg of glucan was incubated with glucoamylase (0.2 units) in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) for 16 h at 40 °C and then boiled for 5 min. The products in the reaction mixture were determined with high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC, see below). The amounts of α-, β-, and γ-CD were measured with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, see below). The amount of glucoamylase-resistant molecules was calculated by subtracting the amount of glucose released by glucoamylase from that of total glucan in the reaction mixture. The amount of glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (26Miwa I. Okuda J. Maeda K. Okuda G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1972; 37: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). HPAEC was carried out based on the DX-300 system (Dionex) with a pulsed amperometric detector (model PAD-II, Dionex) using a Carbopac PA-100 column (4 mm × 250 mm). A sample (25 μl) containing 40 μg of glucan was injected and eluted with a gradient of sodium acetate (0–2 min, 50 mm; 2–37 min, increasing from 50 mm to 350 mm with the installed gradient program 3; 37–45 min, increasing from 350 mm to 850 mm with the installed gradient program 7; 45–47 min, 850 mm) in 150 mm NaOH with a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. HPLC was carried out based on the DX-300 system (Dionex) using an Aminex HPX-42A column. To remove glucose from the reaction mixtures, a sample (50 μl) containing 80 μg of glucan was charged on a Waters Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Millipore), washed with 10 ml of H2O and eluted with 1.5 ml of 50% methanol. The eluate was dried up in vacuo, and dissolved in 50 μl of water. The sample was then injected and eluted with water with a flow rate of 0.6 ml min−1 at 80 °C. The eluate from the column was mixed with 0.3 m LiOH using an anion micromembrane suppressor (model AMMS-II, Dionex), after which the carbohydrate in the eluate was detected with a pulsed amperometric detector (mode PAD-II, Dionex). A reaction mixture (5 ml) containing 10 mg of amylose AS-30 and CGTase (0.7 unit) was incubated in 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 40 °C for 1 h, and then boiled for 10 min. The reaction mixture was incubated with 10 units of glucoamylase at 40 °C for 16 h, and then boiled for 5 min. After removing glucose with the Waters Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, the molecular masses of glucoamylase-resistant glucans were determined with a Kompact Maldi I TOF-MS system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Synthetic amylose AS-30 was incubated with CGTase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. A2-5a. The enzyme reaction was terminated at the early stage of the reaction (10 min), and then the reaction mixture was incubated with glucoamylase to digest the linear amylose into glucose. When the glucoamylase-resistant molecules thus obtained were analyzed with HPAEC, many peaks were detected (Fig.1 A). Note that these peaks were not found in a control experiment with heat-inactivated CGTase (result not shown). Most of these peaks were eluted in the region where cyclic α-1,4-glucans with DPs of over 17, produced by potato D-enzyme on synthetic amylose (Fig. 1 F), were eluted. This result suggests that CGTase produced such cyclic α-1,4-glucans. The large peak around 42 min may indicate the presence of glucoamylase-resistant molecules with DP more than 60, since these molecules were not resolved in this HPAEC condition and eluted together. Then to prove the cyclic structure of glucoamylase-resistant molecules produced by CGTase, their molecular masses were determined with TOF-MS (Fig. 2). A non-cyclic glucan with DP of nhas a molecular mass of 162.1436n + 18.01534 Da, whereas a cyclic glucan should have a molecular mass of 162.1436n Da. The molecular mass of each glucoamylase-resistant molecule was compared with the theoretical value for non-cyclic and cyclic glucans (TableI). As shown in Table I, experimental values of glucoamylase-resistant molecules were consistent with theoretical values for cyclic glucan but not with those for non-cyclic glucan.Table IExperimental and theoretical masses of glucansDPExperimentalTheoreticalCyclic glucanNoncyclic glucan699599610147115711581176813191320133891483148215001016431644166211180718071825121969196919871321312131214914229222932311152456245524731626172617263517277827792797182942294229601931043104312220326732663284Experimental masses of glucans were determined by TOF-MS.

To confirm that the glucoamylase-resistant molecules produced by CGTase are α-1,4-glucans, the structure of these glucans were further examined by treatment with several enzymes. α-Amylase fromBacillus subtilis, an endo-type amylase, completely degraded these molecules to glucose and maltose, and isoamylase and pullulanase, which degrade α-1,6-linkage of glucans, did not (data not shown). These results indicate that the glucoamylase-resistant molecules produced by CGTase were α-1,4-glucans. Based on all the results mentioned above, we concluded that the molecules produced by the CGTase reaction on amylose, as shown in Fig.1 A, were cyclic α-1,4-glucans with DPs ranging from 6 to more than 60. It is known that the glucoamylase-resistant products of the CGTase reaction on amylose, after a prolonged reaction time, are α-, β-, γ-CD and negligible amounts of other glucoamylase-resistant glucans. Our result apparently contradicts this widely held view since the major cyclic α-1,4-glucans produced in the initial stage of the CGTase reaction were not α-, β-, and γ-CD but were those with high DPs. To investigate how large cyclic α-1,4-glucans, which were found in the initial stage of CGTase reaction, were replaced by α-, β-, and γ-CD, the time course of the reaction of CGTase were monitored. Amylose AS-30 was incubated with CGTase from alkalophilicBacillus sp. A2-5a for up to 360 min. Each sample was treated with glucoamylase and was analyzed by HPAEC (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1 (A–E), cyclic α-1,4-glucans with DPs of over 60 were most prevalent after a reaction time of 10 min (Fig.1 A). However, with prolonged reaction, cyclic α-1,4-glucans with high DPs gradually decreased, and those with low DPs increased. At the end of the reaction, the main product of CGTase was β-CD (Fig. 1 E). Fig. 3 shows the time course of the amount of cyclic α-1,4-glucans. The amount of total cyclic α-1,4-glucans increased rapidly from the beginning of the reaction, and their yield reached about 80% at 120 min. However, the amounts of α-, β-, and γ-CD increased at a more slower rate than those of total cyclic α-1,4-glucans. As a result, cyclic α-1,4-glucans, apart from α-, β-, and γ-CD, increased at the early stage of the reaction and reached a yield of about 52% at 50 min, but decreased thereafter. CGTases found in many bacterial species are classified into three types, α-, β-, or γ-CGTase, depending on the major product of the cyclization reaction. The CGTase employed above is β-CGTase because it mainly produces β-CD (25Kometani T. Terada Y. Nishimura T. Takii H. Okada S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 517-520Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To examine whether the production of a large cyclic α-1,4-glucan is the specific feature only found in this CGTase or is the common feature for others, similar experiments were carried out by using CGTases from B. macerans, which is classified as α-CGTase. This enzyme also produced large cyclic α-1,4-glucans in the initial stage of reaction (Fig. 4, Aand B), which were subsequently converted into small cyclic α-1,4-glucans. However, the final major cyclic product was α-CD (Fig. 4 E). It is generally believed that the cyclization reaction of CGTase on amylose is an exo-type attack (2Schmid G. Trends Biotechnol. 1989; 7: 244-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar), where the enzyme recognizes the 6–8 glucose units from the non-reducing end, attacks the adjacent α-1,4-linkage, and transfers it to the C-4 position of the non-reducing end to produce α-, β-, or γ-CD (Fig.5 A). This view was only confirmed from the analysis of CGTase action on 14C-labeled linear α-1,4-glucans with DP 7–12 (27Kobayashi S. Kainuma K. Suzuki S. Proceedings of Symposium of Amylases. 8. The Amylase Research Society of Japan, Osaka, Japan1973: 29-36Google Scholar), but not investigated in high molecular weight glucans. If this view can be applied to the CGTase action on high molecular weight glucans, cyclic products throughout the reaction on amylose are expected to be only α-, β-, and γ-CD. However, the results presented in this paper clearly demonstrate that the cyclic glucans produced in the initial stage of cyclization reaction of CGTase are not only α-, β-, and γ-CD, but are cyclic α-1,4-glucans with various DP ranging from 6 to more than 60. Large cyclic α-1,4-glucans were preferentially produced in the initial stage of cyclization reaction, which were subsequently converted into small cyclic α-1,4-glucans and into the final major products, α-CD or β-CD. Thus these findings apparently contradict the widely held view of the action model of CGTase, and so we propose a new model for the action of CGTase as shown in Fig. 5 B. CGTase probably attacks any α-1,4-linkage within the amylose molecule, and then transfers the newly formed reducing end of the substrate either to the non-reducing end of a separate linear acceptor molecule or glucose (the intermolecular transglycosylation or disproportionation reaction), or to its own non-reducing end (the intramolecular transglycosylation or cyclization reaction, Fig. 5 B). This random cyclization reaction produces wide ranges of cyclic α-1,4-glucans with DP 6 to more than 60. The reversibility of these reactions allows large cyclic molecules to be linearized again by transglycosylation, and smaller cyclic molecules to be subsequently produced. The equilibrium of the whole reaction tends toward the formation of α- or β-CD as the final major products. Both CGTase and D-enzyme catalyze the cyclization and disproportionation of α-1,4-glucan and transglycosidic linearization of cyclic α-1,4-glucan in the presence of a suitable acceptor molecule. During the cyclization reaction, large cyclic α-1,4-glucans were preferentially produced in the initial stage, but were subsequently converted into smaller cyclic α-1,4-glucans in both cases. Thus both enzymes seem to catalyze the same reaction, with the major difference being in the smallest size of the cyclic α-1,4-glucans produced. The DP of the smallest cyclic α-1,4-glucan produced by CGTase is 6. On the other hand, D-enzyme never produced α-, β-, and γ-CD and the smallest cyclic α-1,4-glucan has DP of 17. It is very interesting to know how the specificities of these products are determined differently between D-enzyme and CGTase. In our previous paper (23Takata H. Takaha T. Okada S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1600-1606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we discussed that cyclic α-1,4-glucan with DP 6–8 (α-, β-, and γ-CD) and those with DP more than 17 may have different structures. The structures of cyclic α-1,4-glucan with DP 6–8 (α-, β-, and γ-CD) may fit well to the active site of CGTase, and those with DP more than 17 may fit well to D-enzyme. However, this idea seems to be unlikely because it is now understood that CGTase can also produce cyclic α-1,4-glucans with DP more than 17. One possible explanation for the different product specificity is as follows. The equilibrium of the reaction catalyzed by both enzymes tends toward the formation of smaller cyclic α-1,4-glucans; however, the smallest cyclic α-1,4-glucan molecule to be produced by D-enzyme has DP of 17, whereas that of CGTase is 6. At the moment, we do not know the mechanism to determine the smallest cyclic product of each enzyme, although we speculate that the difference in the smallest products of each enzyme is attributable to the active site structure. Despite the similarity found in their activities, D-enzyme and CGTase show no similarity in their primary sequences (22Takaha T. Yanase M. Okada S. Smith S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1391-1396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of CGTase has already been obtained by x-ray crystallographic studies (3Klein C. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

The selective uptake of HDL-CE is postulated to participate in delivery of tissue-derived cholesterol both to the liver and steroidogenic tissues. Recent studies comparing mice with similarly low levels of HDL, due to the absence of either of the two major HDL-associated apolipoproteins apoA-I and apoA-II, suggest that apoA-I is crucial in modulating this process, possibly through interaction with scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). Because of the central role of LCAT in determining the size, lipid composition, and plasma concentration of HDL, we have created LCAT-deficient mice by gene targeting to examine the effect of LCAT deficiency on HDL structure and composition and adrenal cholesterol delivery. The HDL in the LCAT-deficient mice was reduced in its plasma concentration (92%) and CE content (96%). The HDL particles were heterogeneous in size and morphology and included numerous discoidal particles, mimicking those observed in LCAT-deficient humans. The adrenals of the male Lcat (−/−) mice were severely depleted of lipid stores, which was associated with a 2-fold up-regulation of the adrenal SR-BI mRNA. These studies demonstrate that LCAT deficiency, similar to apoA-I deficiency, is associated with a marked decrease in adrenal cholesterol delivery and supports the hypothesis that adrenal SR-BI expression is regulated by the adrenal cholesterol.

High density lipoprotein (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein(s); LCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; apo, apolipoprotein; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B type I; CE, cholesteryl ester; UC, unesterified cholesterol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); VLDL, very low density lipoprotein(s). 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein(s); LCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; apo, apolipoprotein; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B type I; CE, cholesteryl ester; UC, unesterified cholesterol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); VLDL, very low density lipoprotein(s). plays a pivotal role in lipid homeostasis by removing cholesterol accumulating in the extrahepatic tissues, a process crucial for maintenance of the structure and function of most cells in the body. The mechanism widely held to explain this process, reverse cholesterol transport (1Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), describes the metabolic fate of such tissue-derived cholesterol. According to this mechanism, circulating HDL functions as an acceptor of tissue-derived unesterified cholesterol (UC), facilitating efflux of cholesterol from cells. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) performs a central role in this process by catalyzing the conversion of plasma UC, especially that associated with HDL, to cholesteryl ester (CE). It has been demonstrated that the majority of the CE in HDL is delivered to the liver for clearance or recycling. In addition, a fraction of HDL-CE is delivered to the steroidogenic tissues and is utilized as substrate for steroid hormone synthesis. Routes for delivery of HDL-CE to the target organs include: (i) indirectly, by transferring to apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoprotein particles, (ii) directly through a receptor-mediated endocytotic process (2Chao Y. Windler E.E. Chen G.C. Havel G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11360-11366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Drevon C.A. Attie A.D. Pangburn S.H. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (iii) via selective uptake pathway where CE in lipoprotein particles is delivered into the cells without simultaneous uptake of the apolipoprotein moieties (4Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.A. J. Biol.

A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although numerous patients with a complete deficiency of LCAT have been described, revealing many of the lipoprotein abnormalities and tissue organ damage associated with complete absence of LCAT, there remain many unanswered questions concerning the role of LCAT in the transport of CE to tissues. To date, much of our knowledge of the selective uptake pathway derives from studies on rodents. In rats, not only is the selective uptake pathway responsible for 65% of HDL-CE delivered to the liver, it is the principal mechanism for delivery of CE to the steroidogenic tissues (4Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Murine scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), recently characterized as a potential HDL receptor (7Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar), is believed to participate in mediating the selective uptake of HDL-CE into cells. Key evidence supporting this role for SR-BI includes the tissue expression pattern of SR-BI being coincident with those involved in selective uptake and the observation that SR-BI expression in the adrenal is strongly regulated by intracellular cholesterol content (8Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Recently, an in vivo study comparing apoA-I and apoA-II gene-targeted mice, both with similarly low HDL levels, demonstrated that only the lack of apoA-I severely impairs the delivery of CE to the steroidogenic tissues, causing depletion in adrenal CE stores and blunted steroidogenic responses to stress (9Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although the different consequences of the two low HDL states strongly suggest the crucial importance of apoA-I in HDL in mediating selective uptake of CE, the question of whether there are additional independent modulating factors remains unanswered. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HDL resulting from LCAT deficiency, being severely depleted of CE yet containing apoA-I, impairs cholesterol delivery to the adrenals. To investigate this issue, LCAT-deficient mice were created by gene targeting. The effect of complete LCAT deficiency on lipoproteins and cholesterol transport was characterized in these animals. The strategy for construction of the targeting vector pPN2T/LKO is shown in Fig. 1. The targeting vector was linearized and transfected into ES cells by electroporation. Drug selection was performed using both G418 (160 μg/ml) and FIAU (0.5 μm). Genomic Southern blot was used for screening of targeting events using a PCR based probe that hybridizes to exon 6 of the Lcat gene. The targeted ES cells were injected into blastocysts by standard method (10Paszty C. Narla M. Stevens M. Liebhaber S.A. Loring J.F. Brion C.M. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Chimeric mice were bred with DBAxC57BL/6 F1 hybrids. Genotypes were determined by multiplex PCR. The forward primers either hybridize specifically to the neo-resistant gene (a, 5′-AAGCAAAACCAAATTAAGGGC-3′) or to the targeted region (b, 5′-GCTCCTCAATGTGCCTTCC-3′) and share a common reverse primer which hybridizes to exon 3 of the gene (c, 5′-GTACTCAACAGATTCGGTCTTGC-3′) (Fig. 1 A). LCAT activity was measured on fasting plasma as the rate of synthesis of [3H]cholesteryl esters from unilamellar vesicles prepared with French pressure cell and activated with human apoA-I (Sigma) as described previously (11Francone O.L. Gong E.L. Ng D.S. Fielding C.J. Rubin E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Lipid determinations were performed on 4–8-week-old mice fed a mouse chow diet. Fasting plasma was analyzed using enzyme end point kits for total cholesterol (Boehringer Mannheim), free glycerol, and triglyceride concentrations (Sigma). Plasma triglyceride concentration was corrected for free glycerol content. Cholesteryl ester in lipoprotein fractions was calculated from difference between total and unesterified cholesterol; HDL-cholesterol was measured in plasma after selective precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins by polyethylene glycol. Mouse plasma apoA-I levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (12Francone O.L. Haghpassand M. Benett J.A. Royer L. McNeish J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 38: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The relative proportion of HDL with pre-β- and α-mobility on agarose gel in the Lcat (+/+) andLcat (−/−) mice was determined as described previously (13Francone O.L. Royer L. Haghpassand M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1268-1277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoprotein subfractions of d < 1.063 andd = 1.063–1.21 g/ml were obtained from a pool of 200–250 μl of plasma by standard sequential ultracentrifugation techniques. The size distribution of the lipoprotein fractions were obtained by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis essentially as described by Nichols et al. (14Nichols A.R. Krauss R.M. Muslliner T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The morphology of lipoproteins was assessed by negative staining electron microscopy as described previously (15Forte T.M. Nordhausen R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Tissue lipids were measured in the kidney, liver, spleen, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and adrenal gland of both the Lcat (−/−) andLcat (+/+) mice. After perfusion of the animal with 0.9% saline, the organs were excised, blotted dry, weighed, and homogenized in 1.15% KCl buffer. Lipids were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) and reconstituted in the aqueous phase using Triton X-100. Total cholesterol and UC were measured using an enzymatic assay (17Sale F.O. Marchesini S. Fishman P.H. Berra B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Mice were perfused through the left ventricle with phosphate-buffered saline followed by overnight fixation in 4% formaldehyde. The adrenal glands were infiltrated sequentially with 10, 20, and 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline and quick frozen in Tissue-Tec OCT. 6–10-μm-thick sections were placed on poly-l-lysine coated slides, stained with Oil Red O, and counterstained with hematoxylin (18Coalson R.E. Clark G. Staining Procedures. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1981: 228-229Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from single adrenals from five male Lcat (−/−) and five male wild type mice using RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test “B”, Inc.) and separated in a denaturing 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to Nylon membranes (Schleider & Schuell), cross-linked, and hybridized with a 554-base pair PCR fragment extending from nucleotides 362 to 915 of the murine SR-BI. The SR-BI mRNA Northern blot signal was normalized to that of the human β-actin probe (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., CA) on the same membrane. Genomic Southern blot screening of 200 ES cells targeted with pPN2T/LKO yielded a frequency of 1 in 4 for correct homologous recombination event. 2 of the 10 targeted ES cell clones micro-injected gave germ-line transmission of the targeted allele. Multiplex PCR screening of the targeted mutant is shown in Fig.1 B. Positivity from primer sets b/c alone, a/c plus b/c, and a/c alone identified wild type, heterozygosity, and homozygosity for the targeted Lcat allele respectively. Of 86 offspring from the heterozygote breeding, 25 were wild type, 39 were heterozygotes, and 22 were homozygotes (p = 0.73 by chi square test against the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian inheritance). The LCAT-deficient mice grow normally and are fertile. Plasma LCAT activity of the mutant mice is shown in Fig. 1 C. The Lcat (−/−) mice had no detectable LCAT activity, whereas the heterozygous mice had LCAT activity reduced to 55% of control (p = 0.0001). Compared with wild type controls, lipid analyses on the Lcat (−/−) mice revealed 70.3 and 91.6% reductions in total and HDL cholesterol, respectively (Table I). Plasma CE was reduced to 9.4% of control, whereas plasma UC level was essentially unchanged. As a result, there was a 11.7-fold increase in the UC/CE ratio compared with the wild type littermates. The Lcat (+/−) mice experienced a more moderate but statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol and CE, resulting in a modest 1.7-fold increase in the UC/CE ratio. The genotype-dependent changes in UC/CE ratio was nearly entirely due to changes in plasma CE levels. Likewise, the reduction in total cholesterol in the Lcat (−/−) mice was largely a result of reduction in HDL cholesterol levels, whereas the non-HDL cholesterol levels for each genotype were essentially unchanged. Plasma apoA-I levels in the mutant mice were also reduced in bothLcat (−/−) and Lcat (+/−) mice to 19 and 86% of their respective controls. Lipid analyses on d < 1.063 and d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml fractions from pooled plasma are shown in Table II. The reduction of HDL-CE in the Lcat (−/−) mice was profound, whereas the HDL-UC reduction in the same mice was less dramatic. Agarose gel electrophoresis of HDL showed that compared with wild type control, the fraction of plasma apoA-I in the α-migrating HDL particles in theLcat (−/−) mice was decreased from 93.6 ± 0.8% to 78.3 ± 3.5% (p < 0.01) and was increased from 6.4 ± 0.8% to 21.7 ± 3.5% (p < 0.01) in the pre-β-migrating HDL.Table IPlasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apoA-I levels in Lcat(+/+), Lcat(+/−), and Lcat(−/−) miceGenotypeT.

The lipoprotein size distribution of the Lcat (+/+) and Lcat(−/−) mice in d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml fractions are shown in Fig. 2. The pattern of the d < 1.063 g/ml fraction of Lcat (−/−) mice, in comparison with that of the wild type, showed absence of the 20.5 nm peak, broadening of the 28.0 nm LDL peak to include intermediate density lipoprotein in the region of 32.1 nm, and preservation of the dominant VLDL peak. Unlike a unimodal size distribution of HDL in the wild types, theLcat (−/−) mice had a very complex pattern, characterized by a major peak at 7.6 nm and several minor components similar to that found in human LCAT deficiency (19Mitchell C.D. King W.C. Applegate K.R. Forte T. Glomset J.A. Norum K.R. Gjone E. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 625-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic evaluation of VLDL from the control mice revealed spherical particles with a mean diameter (d) and a S.D. of 63.5 ± 19.1 nm, whereas VLDL from Lcat (−/−) mice were smaller (d± S.D. = 51.7 ± 22.8 nm) and were distinguished by the presence of notched particles (Fig. 3). The HDL from Lcat(−/−) mice, compared with control HDL that were homogeneous spherical particles of 10.0 ± 2.1 nm in diameter, were morphologically complex. An important observation, however, is the presence of discoidal particles that form the classical rouleaux structures. Both morphologic features have been described in LCAT-deficient subjects (19Mitchell C.D. King W.C. Applegate K.R. Forte T. Glomset J.A. Norum K.R. Gjone E. J.

After perfusion, the adrenal glands of the Lcat(−/−) mice appeared brown and translucent, in contrast to a pearly white appearance of adrenals from the wild type mice (Fig.4 A), consistent with the depletion of cholesterol in the former. Staining of the adrenal sections with Oil Red O demonstrated an abundance of stored lipid in the adrenal cortex of the wild type mice. In contrast, the Lcat (−/−) mice showed complete absence of lipid staining (Fig. 4 B). Quantification of tissue lipid in the adrenal glands showed a 61% reduction in total tissue cholesterol, an 82% reduction in CE content, and a 30% reduction in UC content in the Lcat (−/−) mice compared with the wild type control (Fig. 4 C). The normalized adrenal SR-BI mRNA expression levels was 2.0-fold higher in theLcat (−/−) mice compared with the wild type control (p = 0.001) (Fig. 4 D). A complete absence of LCAT activity was observed in theLcat (−/−) mice, whereas the LCAT activity of theLcat (+/−) mice was reduced to approximately half normal, compatible with autosomal co-dominant inheritance. The same inheritance has been reported in a human LCAT-deficient kindred (21Jain S.K. Mohandas N. Sensabaugh G.F. Shojania A.M. Shohet S.B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1982; 99: 816-826PubMed Google Scholar). The alterations of HDL in the Lcat (−/−) mice also resembled those observed in LCAT-deficient humans. This includes a comparable degree of reduction in both plasma HDL cholesterol and apoA-I and the presence of unique discoidal particles with rouleaux formation in theLcat (−/−) mice. Furthermore, we observed a higher proportion of the HDL particles in the Lcat (−/−) mice with pre-β mobility, a finding also noted in LCAT-deficient patients. The impact of LCAT deficiency on non-HDL cholesterol is characterized by a modest increase in the UC level. However, gradient gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy studies showed presence of intermediate density lipoprotein-like particles and notching of VLDL, respectively, in the LCAT-deficient mice. In view of the absence of cholesteryl ester transfer activity in mouse plasma, these findings suggest that LCAT may have a direct effect on the metabolism of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (22Schumaker V.N. Adams G.H. J. Theor. Biol. 1970; 26: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite its central role in reverse cholesterol transport, the impact of LCAT deficiency on plasma cholesterol transport and delivery to target organs has been minimally explored. In LCAT-deficient humans, the rate of cholesterol efflux into plasma is preserved at 72% of normal. This is in part explained by the relative abundance of pre-β-HDL particles, a subpopulation of HDL believed to be the preferred initial acceptors of tissue cholesterol (23von Ackerstein A. Huang Y. Wu S. Funke H. Noseda G. Assmann G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The relative increase in pre-β-HDL is also observed in the LCAT-deficient mice. However, it has not been determined whether the extremely low level of abnormal HDL associated with LCAT deficiency is able to deliver tissue-derived CE to the target organs. The recent study by Plumpet al. (9Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) demonstrating the crucial role that apoA-I plays in the delivery of CE through the selective uptake pathway and the observation by Wang et al. (8Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) that murine adrenal SR-BI receptor expression being up-regulated in association with intracellular cholesterol depletion suggest that ligand-receptor interaction between apoA-I and SR-BI may be a major determinant of effective mediation of CE delivery into the tissues. Our similar observation of severe depletion of tissue lipid stores in mouse adrenals and the finding of a 2-fold up-regulation of adrenal SR-BI mRNA in face of adrenal cholesterol depletion in Lcat(−/−) mice suggests that (i) SR-BI is intimately involved in selective uptake of CE and (ii) this same metabolic pathway is defective in the Lcat (−/−) mice despite the presence of apoA-I in HDL. As in apoA-I-deficient mice, it can be inferred that the minor sources of adrenal tissue cholesterol, namely de novosynthesis and LDL receptor mediated cholesterol uptake, are insufficient to compensate for the cholesterol depletion. InLcat (−/−) mice, the most likely cause for reduced adrenal lipid content is the severe depletion of plasma HDL-CE, the primary source of cellular cholesterol. The impact of LCAT deficiency on the other tissues examined was significantly less than that observed for the adrenal. A hallmark finding in LCAT-deficient subjects is the marked tissue UC accumulation in a number of solid organs including the liver, spleen, and kidney. With the exception of a slight increase in UC in the spleen, these lipid disturbances were not observed in the nonsteroidogenic tissues in the Lcat (−/−) mice. The mild phenotype in these mice is likely due to the relatively small reservoir of total plasma UC level with the consequent minor impact on tissue lipid homeostasis (24Hovig T. Gjone E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1974; 33: 135-146Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In summary, the LCAT-deficient mouse created by gene targeting reproduces the human LCAT-deficient HDL metabolic abnormalities with high fidelity. The noted morphologic abnormalities of VLDL suggest that LCAT may have a direct role in the catabolism of triglyceride-rich, apoB-containing particles. Finally, these studies suggest that the reduced cholesterol content of HDL from deficiency of LCAT likely impacts on the flux of cholesterol to the adrenals via the selective uptake pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1984152194,"A 150-kDa protein that inhibits phospholipase D (PLD) activity stimulated by ADP-ribosylation factor and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) was previously purified from rat brain. The sequences of peptides derived from the purified PLD inhibitor now identify it as synaptojanin, a nerve terminal protein that has been implicated in the endocytosis of fused synaptic vesicles and shown to be a member of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase family. Further characterization of the enzymatic properties of synaptojanin now shows that it hydrolyzes only the 5-phosphate from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (I(1,4,5)P3) and that it does not catalyze the dephosphorylation of either I(1,3,4)P3 or inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. However, synaptojanin hydrolyzes both the 4- and 5-phosphates of PI(4,5)P2 and the 4-phosphate of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, converting both compounds to phosphatidylinositol. Magnesium is required for the hydrolysis of I(1,4,5)P3, but not for that of phosphoinositides, by synaptojanin. The inhibition of PLD by synaptojanin is attributable to its ability to hydrolyze PI(4,5)P2. Synaptojanin did not inhibit PLD in the absence of PI(4,5)P2, and the extent of PLD inhibition was related to the extent of PI(4,5)P2hydrolysis in substrate vesicles. It has been proposed that the biosynthesis of PI(4,5)P2 and the activation of PLD by ADP-ribosylation factor constitute a positive loop to increase rapidly the concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidic acid (PA) during membrane vesiculation. The PA thus produced, probably together with PI(4,5)P2, facilitates vesicle coat assembly. The hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2, and consequent inhibition of PLD, by synaptojanin might therefore constitute a mechanism to halt the positive loop connecting PI(4,5)P2 and PA during the endocytotic cycle of synaptic vesicles and serve as a signal for uncoating.

One of these inhibitors was purified to homogeneity to yield a 150-kDa protein that was tentatively named inhibitor IA.

However, a subsequent search revealed that the two sequences, EANAPAFD and GSVPLFWE, match exactly those of residues 276–283 and residues 251–258, respectively, of synaptojanin, a protein that is enriched in nerve terminals and was recently cloned (8McPherson P.S.

The central region of synaptojanin is highly homologous to a family of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (IP 5-Pases) that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of inositol polyphosphates or phosphoinositides at the 5′-position of the inositol ring (8McPherson P.S.

Here, we confirm that inhibitor IA is indeed synaptojanin, characterize its catalytic properties, and show that it inhibits PLD by hydrolyzing PI(4,5)P2. Rat brains were obtained from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR); bovine brain PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL); GTPγS and PI(4,5)P2 were from Boehringer Mannheim; [choline-methyl-3H]dipalmitoyl PC [(pam)2PC] (50 Ci/mmol), [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H](pam)2PC (89 Ci/mmol), [inositol-2-3H]PI(4,5)P2(7 Ci/mmol), and [2-3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [I(1,4,5)P3] (21 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN; andn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was from Calbiochem. Partially purified PLD as well as homogeneous preparations of the 150-kDa PLD inhibitor IA (synaptojanin) and ARF were obtained from rat brain as described (7Han J.-S. Chung J.-K. Kang H.-S.

The cells were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride), and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet from the second centrifugation step was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.7%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and stirred for 1 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, solubilized proteins (∼5 mg of protein in 5 ml) were applied onto a TSK-gel heparin-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.7%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 mNaCl in 60 ml of equilibration buffer. Fractions (1 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and assayed for PLD activity as described below. Peak fractions (fractions 54–60) were pooled to yield 190 μg of protein. The proteins were then divided into aliquots (25 μl) and stored at −70 °C. After thawing, the enzyme was used within several hours. ARF-dependent PLD activity was assayed, essentially as described (7Han J.-S. Chung J.-K. Kang H.-S. Donaldson J. Bae Y.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Briefly, 25 μl of lipid vesicles containing PE, PI(4,5)P2, and PC in molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 with either [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H](pam)2PC (total ∼106 cpm/assay) or [choline-methyl- 3H] (pam)2PC (total ∼200,000 cpm/assay) were added to 125 μl of a mixture containing PLD source, 100 nm ARF, 5 μmGTPγS, 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm EGTA, 80 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. The final concentration of PC was 3.4 μm, and the free Ca2+ concentration was calculated to be 300 nm. The assay mixture for the measurement of PA and PEtOH also contained 0.67% (v/v) ethanol. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h for the measurement of PA and PEtOH and for 30 min for the measurement of choline. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of stop solution containing chloroform, methanol, and concentrated HCl (50:50:0.3, v/v) and 0.35 ml of 1 m HCl containing 5 mm EGTA. After separation of the organic and aqueous phases by centrifugation, the former was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for the measurement of [3H]PA and [3H]PEtOH as described (11Pai J.-K Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12472-12477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); alternatively, [3H]choline in the aqueous phase was measured directly, as described (7Han J.-S. Chung J.-K. Kang H.-S.

Mixed phospholipid vesicles containing PE, PI(4,5)P2, and PC in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 with [inositol-2-3H]PI(4,5)P2 to yield ∼26,000 cpm/assay were prepared. Assays were initiated by adding 170 ng of PLC to a 100-μl reaction mixture containing the phospholipid vesicles, various concentrations of synaptojanin, 50 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 120 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2.0 mm CaCl2, and 25 ng of bovine serum albumin. The final concentrations of PI(4,5)P2and free Ca2+ were 4.8 μm and 0.1 mm, respectively. After 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated and the amount of [3H]I(1,4,5)P3 was quantitated as described (10Hwang S.C. Jhon D.-Y. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18342-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We purified three additional tryptic peptides of inhibitor IA; their sequences (QQNWDSLIAGDQLINQK, SAEDLDLLNAS, and EVIAVQGPPD) matched exactly those of synaptojanin residues 748–764, 820–830, and 884–893, respectively. Furthermore, rabbit antiserum prepared against inhibitor IA recognized a 150-kDa protein in rat brain homogenate but not in the homogenates of other rat tissues including liver, kidney, lung, heart, and spleen (data not shown). This tissue distribution is consistent with the nerve terminal-specific expression of synaptojanin (12McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results confirm that inhibitor IA is synaptojanin. Given that synaptojanin is an IP 5-Pase, we investigated the possibility that synaptojanin inhibits PLD by hydrolyzing the activator PI(4,5)P2. First, the inhibitory activity of synaptojanin was evaluated in the absence of PI(4,5)P2. The ARF-dependent activity of hPLD1 in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 is ∼5% of that in its presence, so the amount of hPLD1 used to measure activity in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 was 20 times that used in the presence of the activator. Because this increased amount of partially purified hPLD1 might introduce enzymes that cause nonspecific hydrolysis of PC, we measured the production of PEtOH, as well as that of PA, from [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H](pam)2PC in the presence of ethanol. PLD attacks PC to form a transient phosphatidyl-PLD intermediate. With water as an acceptor, PA is the product; however, in the presence of ethanol, the phosphatidyl moiety is also transferred to the alcohol, generating PEtOH, in a reaction specific to PLD (11Pai J.-K Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12472-12477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas synaptojanin at 8 nmcompletely inhibited the formation of both PA and PEtOH in the presence of PI(4,5)P2, it had no effect on the formation of either product in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 (Fig.1).Figure 1Effects of synaptojanin on ARF-dependent hPLD1 activity in the absence or presence of PI(4,5)P2. hPLD1 (11 ng for lanes 2 and3, and 216 ng for lanes 5 and 6) was incubated with phospholipid substrate vesicles in a reaction mixture containing 0.67% (v/v) ethanol in the absence (lanes 2 and5) or presence (lanes 3 and 6) of 8 nm synaptojanin. The substrate vesicles comprised either PE, PI(4,5)P2, and [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H](pam)2PC in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 (lanes 1–3) or PE and [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H](pam)2PC in a molar ratio of 16:1 (lanes 4–6). The final concentration and specific radioactivity of PC were identical in the two substrate systems. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the lipid products were analyzed by TLC and visualized by autoradiography. The positions of PC, PA, and PEtOH are indicated. Lanes 1 and 4represent analysis of the reaction mixture before the addition of hPLD1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next incubated substrate vesicles containing PE, PI(4,5)P2, and [choline-methyl- 3H](pam)2PC in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 with synaptojanin for various times before the addition of hPLD1. The activity of hPLD1 decreased as the time of preincubation of vesicles with synaptojanin increased (Fig.2). The extent of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis during the preincubation with synaptojanin was measured with substrate vesicles with a lipid composition identical to that for the PLD inhibition assay with the exception that the 3H-labeled lipid was PI(4,5)P2 instead of PC. Under this assay condition, only ∼20% of total PI(4,5)P2 appeared to be available for hydrolysis by synaptojanin (Figs. 2 and3), probably because the lipid substrate consisted predominantly of multilamellar vesicles with only 20% of their PI(4,5)P2 exposed to the enzyme. Nevertheless, the extent of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis correlated qualitatively with the extent of PLD inhibition (Fig. 2). The products of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis by synaptojanin were analyzed with the use of substrate vesicles containing PE, PI(4,5)P2, and PC (Fig. 3). The major product was PI rather than PIP; the amount of PIP produced varied from negligible (Fig.3 A) to ∼25% of that of PI (see Fig. 5). However, with a micellar substrate containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and PI(4,5)P2, synaptojanin generated PIP and PI in a 3:1 ratio (data not shown). The hydrolysis of PI(4)P was demonstrated directly with vesicles containing PE, PI(4)P, and PC in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1; the rate of PI(4)P hydrolysis was ∼1.5 times that of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis measured with vesicles of identical lipid composition with the exception that PI(4)P was replaced by PI(4,5)P2 (data not shown). These results suggest that the relative rates of hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P by synaptojanin depend on the physical nature of the substrate. Because PI(4)P and PI(5)P cannot be distinguished by TLC, we do not know whether synaptojanin dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P2sequentially, the 5-phosphate followed by the 4-phosphate (orvice versa), or randomly. The hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by synaptojanin was dependent on the concentration of the latter (Fig. 3 B). We tested the phosphatase activity of synaptojanin with I(1,4,5)P3, I(1,3,4)P3, and I(1,4)P2. As previously shown (8McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), I(1,4,5)P3was converted to IP2 in a synaptojanin concentration-dependent manner, and no further dephosphorylation to IP was observed (Fig.4 A). Hydrolysis of I(1,3,4)P3(Fig. 4 B) or I(1,4)P2 (Fig. 4 C) was not apparent, even in the presence of high concentrations of synaptojanin. Thus, unlike the situation with phosphoinositides, the hydrolysis of inositol polyphosphates by synaptojanin appears specific to the 5-phosphate. Furthermore, whereas the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by synaptojanin did not require Mg2+(the rate was slightly faster in the absence of Mg2+), the synaptojanin-catalyzed hydrolysis of I(1,4,5)P3 was absolutely dependent on the presence of Mg2+ (Fig.5). We previously showed that inhibitor IA (synaptojanin) did not inhibit the PI(4,5)P2-hydrolyzing activity of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) when measured with substrate vesicles containing PE, PI(4,5)P2, and PC in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 (7Han J.-S.

Inhibition was not apparent probably because PLC activity was assayed by measuring the release of water-soluble 3H-labeled inositol phosphates from [inositol- 3H]PI(4,5)P2 and because PI and PIP derived from dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 by synaptojanin are also substrates for PLC-γ1. PLC-β1, PLC-γ1, and PLC-δ1 all hydrolyze PI, PIP, and PI(4,5)P2, but the selectivity for PI(4,5)P2 over PI decreases in the rank order PLC-β1 > PLC-δ1 > PLC-γ1 (13Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Cho K.S. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6649-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the effect of synaptojanin on the [inositol- 3H]PI(4,5)P2-hydrolyzing activity of the three PLC isozymes (Fig. 6). Whereas the activity of PLC-γ1 was not affected, the activities of PLC-β1 and PLC-δ1 were inhibited by synaptojanin in a concentration-dependent manner. The rank order of the extent of inhibition, PLC-β1 > PLC-δ1 > PLC-γ1, is consistent with the selectivity of the PLC isozymes for PI(4,5)P2 over PI. IP 5-Pases vary markedly in both molecular size and amino acid sequence. However, they contain two short motifs (of six to nine amino acids) that are separated by fairly constant numbers of amino acids (14Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Majerus P.W.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar): Group 1 enzymes hydrolyze I(1,4,5)P3 and I(1,3,4,5)P4 but not lipid substrates such as PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, group 2 enzymes hydrolyze the two inositol phosphate substrates [I(1,4,5)P3 and I(1,3,4,5)P4] as well as the two lipid substrates [PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3], and group 3 enzymes hydrolyze only substrates containing a 3-phosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3 and I(1,3,4,5)P4]. The central region of synaptojanin contains the two IP 5-Pase-specific motifs and was previously shown, in the presence of Mg2+, to hydrolyze I(1,4,5)P3 and I(1,3,4,5)P4, but not I(1,3,4)P3, and was reported to convert PI(4,5)P2 to an unspecified PIP (8McPherson P.S.

Synaptojanin was, therefore, considered a group 2 IP 5-Pase (15Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The 75-kDa human platelet IP 5-Pase, a group 2 member, also requires Mg2+for activity (17Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now further characterized the catalytic properties of synaptojanin with a homogeneous preparation. The synaptojanin used in the previous study of McPherson et al. (8McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) was either immunoprecipitated with antibodies to synaptojanin or had been exposed to a denaturing condition during purification. Our data suggest that synaptojanin specifically hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate in inositol polyphosphates. However, it dephosphorylates both the 5- and 4-positions, showing a preference for the 4-phosphate over the 5-phosphate under certain conditions, of lipid substrates. Furthermore, Mg2+ was not required for the activity toward lipid substrates. Synaptojanin thus resembles the 90-kDa polyphosphoinositide phosphatase purified from rat brain, which hydrolyzes phosphate from the 4- and 5-positions of PI(4,5)P2 to yield PI in the absence of Mg2+ (18Hope H.M.R. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23648-23654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the 90-kDa enzyme is specific for phosphoinositides and does not act on I(1,4,5)P3 (18Hope H.M.R. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23648-23654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The characteristics of the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of synaptojanin suggest a possible role in membrane trafficking. The NH2-terminal region is similar to the cytosolic domain of yeast SacI protein (8McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The sac1 gene was identified as a suppressor of the sec14 mutant, which is defective in post-Golgi membrane trafficking (19Cleves A.E. Novick P.J. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); Sec14 protein is a PI transfer protein. The proline-rich COOH terminus of synaptojanin interacts with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of amphiphysin (8McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and Grb-2 (12McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which also bind to the proline-rich domain of dynamin. Dynamin is a GTPase that colocalizes with synaptojanin in nerve terminals and functions in the closure of coated vesicles budding from the plasmalemma, including nerve terminal clathrin-coated vesicles that participate in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes after exocytosis (12McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Amphiphysin also interacts with the clathrin adapter protein AP-2 through a region distinct from its SH3 domain and may therefore help concentrate dynamin and synaptojanin at clathrin-coated pits (20De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 21David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Amphiphysin contains regions that are similar to the yeast proteins Rvs161p and Rvs167p, mutations in which result in defects in endocytosis (22David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M.I. Mol. Gen.

On the basis of these observations, synaptojanin was suggested to participate with dynamin and amphiphysin in the endocytotic pathway of synaptic vesicles (12McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P.

A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence indicates that phosphoinositide metabolism is critical for the regulation of vesicular traffic (20De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Studies on Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release from permeabilized PC12 cells indicate that PI transfer protein and PIP 5-kinase are cytosolic factors required for exocytosis (25Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), probably because the generation of PI(4,5)P2 is a critical event in priming. It is thought that PI transfer protein presents PI to PI 4-kinase associated with secretory vesicles; PI is thus phosphorylated to PI(4)P, which is further converted to PI(4,5)P2 by PIP 5-kinase. PI(4,5)P2 binds AP-2 and dynamin, both of which function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, the generation of PI(4,5)P2 appears to be important for not only exocytosis but also subsequent budding of the discharged vesicles. Studies on the formation of coatomer-coated Golgi vesicles also suggest a role for PI(4,5)P2 in bud formation. Cytosolic ARF has been proposed to exchange bound GDP for GTP at the Golgi surface; the resulting Golgi-bound ARF-GTP then recruits coatomer from the cytosol to assemble the bud (26Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 stimulates the ARF GTP-GDP exchange reaction (27Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and might thereby contribute to coat assembly. PI(4,5)P2, together with the GTP-bound ARF, also activates PLD, with the resulting generation of PA (6Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PA stimulates the activity of PI(4)P 5-kinase (28Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in increased synthesis of PI(4,5)P2, which, in turn, would cause further stimulation of ARF and PLD activity, leading to more production of PA and PI(4,5)P2. This positive feedback loop would be expected to cause a rapid increase in PA and PI(4,5)P2 and result in a substantial change in the microdomain architecture of the lipid bilayer that would facilitate coat assembly (29Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of ARF-bound GTP stimulated by an ARF-specific GTPase-activating protein has been proposed as a signal for terminating the positive feedback loop (29Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and serving as a switch for uncoating (26Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, loading ARF with GTPγS was shown to prevent uncoating and induce an accumulation of coated vesicles (26Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Recent studies by Ktistakis et al. (2Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) indicate that the dual actions of ARF, activation of PLD and induction of coatomer binding, are related events. ARF-dependent PLD is abundant in Golgi membranes (30Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). When Golgi membranes were prepared from cell lines with high constitutive PLD activity, cytosolic ARF was not necessary for initiating coat assembly. Furthermore, the generation of PA in Golgi membranes by an exogenous bacterial PLD was shown to induce coatomer binding. Purified coatomer also bound selectively to artificial lipid vesicles that contained PA and PI(4,5)P2. These observations led Ktistakis et al. to propose that the main role of activated ARF is to activate PLD, and that both the PA produced by the activated PLD and PI(4,5)P2, not ARF, are responsible for stable binding of coatomer (2Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The observations of Ktistakis et al. (2Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) also raise a question with regard to the proposed role of the hydrolysis of ARF-bound GTP as the signal for uncoating and the halt of the positive loop between PA and PI(4,5)P2 generation. One can hypothesize that hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by a specific phosphatase might instead constitute such a signal; the resulting decrease in PI(4,5)P2 concentration would result in the deactivation of PLD as well as in the termination of the PI(4,5)P2-dependent GTP-GDP exchange on ARF. In support of this hypothesis, an IP 5-Pase, termed OCRL, has been specifically localized to the Golgi complex (31Olivos-Glander I.M. Pasi A.J. Nussbaum R.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 57: 817-823Google Scholar). Mutations in theOCRL gene are responsible for the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL), which is characterized by mental retardation, cataracts, and defects in renal tubular absorption (32Attree O. Olivos I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that OCRL protein inhibits ARF-activated PLD. 2F. Sekiya, C. Lee, and S. G. Rhee, unpublished observation. PLD activity has not been detected in association with synaptic vesicles. However, by analogy with Golgi vesicular traffic, a similar positive interaction between PI(4,5)P2 formation and PLD activation may play a regulatory role in clathrin coating. Furthermore, the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by synaptojanin may serve to interrupt the positive loop and to act as the signal for uncoating. In such a model, it would be important that synaptojanin acts on PI(4,5)P2 after coating. Such timing might be achieved through the SH3-dependent interaction with amphiphysin or phosphorylation of synaptojanin. Synaptojanin, like dynamin, is a phosphoprotein that undergoes dephosphorylation in response to nerve terminal depolarization (12McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Rodney Levine and Michael Nauman for peptide sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2031491552,"Oncostatin M (OSM) mediates its bioactivities through two different heterodimer receptors. They both involve the gp130-transducing receptor, which dimerizes with either leukemia inhibitory receptor β or with OSM receptor β (OSMRβ) to generate, respectively, type I and type II OSM receptors. Co-precipitation of gp130-associated proteins, flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction, and tyrosine phosphorylation analyses allowed the characterization of both types of OSM receptors expressed on the surface of different cell lines. It also allowed the detection of a large size protein, p250, that specifically associates to the type II OSM receptor components and that is tyrosine-phosphorylated after the activation peak of the gp130·OSMRβ heterocomplex. The restricted expression of type I OSM receptor by the JAR choriocarcinoma cell line, and type II receptor by the A375 melanoma cell line, permitted the characterization of their signaling machineries. Both type I and type II OSM receptors activated Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. The information is next relayed to the nucleus by the STAT3 transcriptional activator, which is recruited by both types of OSM receptors. In addition, STAT5b was specifically activated through the gp130·OSMRβ type II heterocomplex. The signaling pathway differences observed between the common type I LIF/OSM receptor and the specific type II OSM receptor might explain some of the bioactivities specifically displayed by OSM."

Fisher H. Ganten D. J. Hypertens. 1991; 9: 3-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this growth-promoting effect of ANG II is considered to contribute to the development of various cardiovascular diseases characterized by VSMC growth such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and restenosis following balloon angioplasty (2Daemen M.J.A.P.

Science. 1989; 245: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), it is important to define the signaling pathways of ANG II that mediate the growth response of VSMC. ANG II acts via a high affinity cell surface receptor called the AT1 receptor. Although this receptor is a seven-transmembrane, heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor, some of the intracellular signals mediated by the AT1 receptor are similar to the signaling pathways activated by receptor tyrosine kinases such as platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptors. For instance, ANG II induces tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases (5Tsuda T. Kawahara Y. Ishida Y. Koide M. Shii K. Yokoyama M. Circ.

ANG II, however, subsequently induces cell hypertrophy as a result of increased protein synthesis rather than cell proliferation in cultured VSMC (11Geisterfer A.A.T. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ.

Recently, we and others have shown that ANG II induces activation of the ras protooncogene product (Ras), a membrane-bound GTPase with a relative molecular mass of 21 kDa, via the AT1 receptor in cultured VSMC (13Okuda M.

Because Ras plays a pivotal role in signaling from the tyrosine kinase receptors of various growth factors to the MAP kinase pathway (16Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 17Feig L.A. Schaffhausen B. Nature. 1994; 370: 508-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), this finding tempts us to speculate that Ras activation may be involved in the mechanism by which ANG II induces MAP kinase activation in VSMC. However, recent studies in various cells suggest that the relative contribution made by Ras to the activation mechanisms of the MAP kinase pathway by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors varies for different agonists and in different cell types (18Cobb M.H.

In the present study, we assessed the requirement of Ras activation for the ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation and stimulation of protein synthesis in cultured VSMC. The results clearly indicate that Ras activation is dispensable not only for ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation but also for stimulation of protein synthesis in VSMC.

After washing the gel, the enzymes were denatured in 6m guanidine HCl and then renatured in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.04% Tween 40. Kinase reaction was carried out by incubating the gel with [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation, the gel was extensively washed and dried. The radioactivity was analyzed using a Fujix bioimaging analyzer BAS2000. Replication-defective E1− and E3− adenoviral vectors containing CA promoter comprising a cytomegalovirus enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter were prepared as described previously (22Ueno H.

Subconfluent VSMC grown on 60-mm dishes were incubated with DMEM containing either AdRasY57 or AdLacZ (20 plaque-forming units/cell) for 2 h at room temperature and then washed once with 2 ml of DMEM and incubated with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for more 2 days. Then cells were growth-arrested for 48 h in DMEM prior to use. Protein synthesis was measured by [3H]leucine incorporation as described previously (26Takahashi T. Kawahara Y. Okuda M. Yokoyama M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The quiescent VSMC were stimulated with ANG II in serum-free DMEM containing 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]leucine. After 24 h, the radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry after solubilization in 0.1 n NaOH. Cell protein was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Since a number of investigators have shown that tyrosine kinase activity is essential for Ras and/or MAP kinase activation by various stimuli in their respective target cells (16Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 19Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. McLees A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), we examined whether tyrosine kinase activity was required for ANG II-induced Ras and MAP kinase activation, using two distinct tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and herbimycin A. As has been previously reported (13Okuda M. Kawahara Y. Yokoyama M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H595-H601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the unstimulated VSMC displayed a low level of Ras-GTP (Fig. 1). ANG II caused an approximately 3-fold increase in the accumulation of Ras-GTP in VSMC. Ras activation by ANG II was prevented completely by pretreatment with genistein (100 μm) or herbimycin A (3 μm). Using a MAP kinase renaturation assay in MBP-containing polyacrylamide gels, we investigated whether genistein and herbimycin A also inhibited ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation (Fig. 2). These two tyrosine kinase inhibitors, however, had no effect on ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation.Figure 2Effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation. VSMC were incubated with or without either 100 μm genistein for 10 min or 3 μm herbimycin A for 30 min prior to stimulation with 100 nm ANG II for 5 min.

We next tested the effect of wortmannin, which is a fungal metabolite that has been characterized as an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase at less than 100 nm (33Arcaro A. Wymann M.P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on ANG II-induced Ras and MAP kinase activation. Wortmannin (50 nm) completely blocked the stimulatory effect of ANG II on Ras activation (Fig.3 A). In contrast, this concentration of wortmannin failed to inhibit ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation (Fig.3 B). The results of experiments using the tyrosine kinase inhibitors and wortmannin strongly suggest that ANG II stimulates MAP kinases by a Ras-independent pathway in VSMC. Because these pharmacological drugs may affect other reactions besides Ras activation, we used a more specific molecular tool, the adenovirus expressing a dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras (AdRasY57) in the next set of experiments. The adenovirus expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase (AdLacZ) was used as a control. As has been described (24Ueno, H., Yamamoto, H., Ito, S., Li, J.-J., and Takeshita, A. (1997)Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., in press.Google Scholar), AdRasY57-infected VSMC expressed markedly elevated levels of Ras protein as compared with both uninfected and AdLacZ-infected control cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, expression of RasY57 decreased the basal levels of Ras-GTP and completely prevented the stimulatory effect of ANG II on Ras activation. Expression of β-galactosidase had no effect on basal levels of Ras-GTP and ANG II-increased Ras-GTP accumulation. In consistent with the results of the pharmacological experiments described above, expression of RasY57 had no effect on ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, even in AdRasY57-infected VSMC, ANG II stimulated protein synthesis to extents similar to those observed in uninfected and AdLacZ-infected control cells (Fig. 5 B). In all experiments so far described, we used a high concentration (100 nm) of ANG II to induce maximal responses of VSMC. It is possible that Ras activation may contribute to MAP kinase activation and stimulation of protein synthesis by lower concentrations of ANG II and that an alternative Ras-independent pathway(s) may be utilized at higher concentrations of ANG II. Therefore, in the last set of experiments, we used a lower concentration (1 nm) of ANG II and examined the effects of expression of RasY57 on Ras and MAP kinase activation and stimulation of protein synthesis. Expression of RasY57 also inhibited Ras activation by 1 nm ANG II (Fig.6 A) but failed to prevent MAP kinase activation and stimulation of protein synthesis even by this low concentration of ANG II (Fig. 6, B and C).Figure 5Effects of AdRasY57 (a dominant negative mutant) expression on ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation and protein synthesis.

Kawahara Y. Ishida Y. Koide M. Shii K. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). ANG II also induces activation of the raf protooncogene product (Raf) and MAP kinase kinase in this cell type (35Ishida Y. Kawahara Y. Tsuda T. Koide M. Yokoyama M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Molloy C.J. Taylor D.S. Weber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7338-7345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, several investigators including us have clearly demonstrated that ANG II induces activation of Ras via AT1 receptors in VSMC (13Okuda M. Kawahara Y. Yokoyama M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H595-H601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Chai Q. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In our study (13Okuda M. Kawahara Y. Yokoyama M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H595-H601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, we found that pertussis toxin treatment, which markedly inhibited ANG II-induced Ras activation, had no inhibitory effect on ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation. This differential sensitivity to pertussis toxin of these reactions suggests that Ras activation may be dispensable for ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation in VSMC. However, since the pertussis toxin treatment did not completely inhibit ANG II-induced Ras activation, we could not rule out the possibility that ANG II was activating MAP kinases via residual Ras activity. The results reported herein extended these observations and showed that treatment with two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and herbimycin A) or wortmannin, which completely inhibited ANG II-induced Ras activation, had no effect on ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation. Further, we showed that expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras, which completely blocked ANG II-induced activation of endogenous Ras, presumably by interfering with exchange of GDP for GTP (25Jung V. Wei W. Ballester R. Camonis J. Mi S. Van Aelst L. Wigler M. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3707-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), had no effect on ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation. These results indicate that ANG II induces MAP kinase activation by a Ras-independent pathway in VSMC. Previous reports showed that depletion of protein kinase C by pretreatment with a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, markedly blocked ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation, suggesting that MAP kinase activation by ANG II is mediated mainly by protein kinase C activation (5Tsuda T. Kawahara Y. Ishida Y. Koide M. Shii K. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 37Malarkey K. McLees A. Paul A. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C is known to activate Raf by direct phosphorylation (18Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Indeed, protein kinase C-activating phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate can stimulate MAP kinases without activating Ras in VSMC (5Tsuda T. Kawahara Y. Ishida Y. Koide M. Shii K. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Okuda M. Kawahara Y. Yokoyama M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H595-H601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the present results and these previous findings, it is likely that ANG II induces MAP kinase activation predominantly by a Ras-independent and protein kinase C-dependent pathway in VSMC. Recently, Eguchiet al. (15Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) also reported that ANG II induced Ras and MAP kinase activation in cultured rat VSMC. In their system, however, ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation was only partially impaired by pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but was abolished by treatment with an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, TMB-8, a calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium, and genistein. Furthermore, both ANG II-induced MAP kinase activation and Ras activation were insensitive to pertussis toxin treatment in their study. Based on these findings, they proposed that ANG II induces MAP kinase activation via Ras activation, which is mediated by an unidentified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent tyrosine kinase in VSMC. The reason for the discrepancies between our results and theirs is unclear at present, but the discrepancies may be due to differences in phenotypes of our cells and theirs, because it is well known that various degrees of dedifferentiation occur when VSMC are placed in culture (38Bochaton-Piallat M.-L. Ropraz P. Gabbiani F. Gabbiani G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ANG II activates Ras via the AT1 receptor and Gi protein remains unclear. The inhibitory effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on Ras activation by ANG II suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in this process. It has been shown that activation of the ANG II receptor as well as other Gi-coupled-receptors such as α2-adrenergic, lysophosphatidic acid, and endothelin receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, resulting in its association with a Grb2-Sos complex (39Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Shc-Grb2-Sos complexes may propagate signals not only from growth factor receptors but also from Gi protein-coupled receptors including the ANG II receptor as well. The pathway leading to Shc phosphorylation may involve βγ subunits of Gi protein because lysophosphatidic acid- and α2-adrenergic receptor-induced Shc phosphorylation is blocked by coexpression of a βγ binding peptide derived from βARK1 (40Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Recently, Schieffer et al. (14Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Chai Q. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10329-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have suggested that ANG II activates Ras by inhibiting the GAP activity through tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP by c-Src in VSMC. Therefore, it is possible that, to fully activate Ras, ANG II may utilize two mechanisms simultaneously, i.e. stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP by Sos through tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and inhibiting the hydrolysis of bound GTP by GAP through tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP. In the present study, we also showed that wortmannin inhibited ANG II-induced Ras activation in VSMC. Similar inhibitory effect of wortmannin on Ras activation was observed in adipocytes stimulated with insulin (32DePaolo D. Reusch J.E.-B. Carel K. Bhuripanyo P. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this cell type, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with wortmannin resulted in significant activation of GAP and reduction in Ras-GTP. Therefore, it is possible that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may be involved in the mechanism by which ANG II induces Ras activation via inhibiting GAP activity. Using a dominant negative strategy, Ras has been shown to be involved in stimulation of VSMC proliferation by serum, platelet-derived growth factor, acidic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and thrombin (24Ueno, H., Yamamoto, H., Ito, S., Li, J.-J., and Takeshita, A. (1997)Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., in press.Google Scholar, 41Irani K. Herzlinger S. Finkel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By the same strategy, we also explored the role of Ras in ANG II-induced hypertrophic response of VSMC. We found that expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ras did not inhibit ANG II-induced stimulation of protein synthesis, indicating that Ras activation is not required for ANG II-induced hypertrophic response of VSMC. It is becoming apparent that Ras may have multiple effectors besides Raf and play diverse roles in cell responses other than cell growth (16Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 17Feig L.A. Schaffhausen B. Nature. 1994; 370: 508-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Ras activated by ANG II may play roles unrelated to MAP kinase activation and cell growth in VSMC. Further studies are needed to clarify the roles of Ras in ANG II actions as well as the mechanism by which ANG II activates Ras in VSMC."

LpL, an unstable enzyme, must retain its activity during this process. Whether a chaperone-like molecule is involved in LpL stabilization and transport is unclear. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that endothelial cells secrete factors that release LpL and promote its transfer to the luminal endothelial surface. Incubation of adipocytes with endothelial cell conditioned medium (ECCM) led to release of about 2-fold more LpL activity than control medium. Medium from endothelial cells exposed to lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-ECCM), a product of LpL lipolysis of lipoproteins, released approximately 3-fold more LpL than ECCM. Concomitant with the release of LpL, adipocyte cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans were degraded suggesting that lyso-ECCM contained a heparanase-like activity. More heparanase was found in media from the basolateral than the apical side of lysolecithin-stimulated polarized endothelial cells. In coculture experiments, lipolysis and lysolecithin stimulation of endothelial cells increased LpL release from adipocytes. LpL released by lyso-ECCM remained stable and did not lose enzymatic activity at 37 °C for 1 h. LpL activity was also stabilized by heparanase-digested fragments of HS (HS oligosaccharide) and by purified LpL binding decasaccharide. Moreover, LpL·HS oligosaccharide complexes crossed endothelial cell monolayers and bound to the apical side of the cells.

Invest. 1993; 92: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Unlike most secretory proteins, newly synthesized LpL appears to transiently reside on cell surfaces, e.g. adipocytes (21Camps L. Reina M. Llobera M. Vilaró S. Olivecrona T. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C673-C681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Cupp M. Bensadoun A. Melford K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6383-6388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LpL is a very unstable protein in solution (23Osborne J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). How LpL is able to maintain its activity after its release from adipocytes and during its transport to endothelial cells is unclear. Within cells, a number of unstable proteins are protected by being associated with a second, chaperone, molecule (24Hedrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 25Beckman R.P. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. Science. 1990; 248: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Most chaperones are proteins that function by binding specifically and non-covalently to unstable proteins preventing their misfolding and degradation. LpL, however, has no known chaperones involved in maintaining its activity and facilitating its transport. While investigating the mechanisms for LpL release from adipocytes, we discovered that endothelial cells produce an HS-degrading heparinase-like enzyme that dissociates the LpL from cultured adipocytes. The released LpL was associated with an oligosaccharide that made it more stable in solution. In contrast to heparin, this oligosaccharide did not inhibit LpL binding to endothelial cells. Thus, the oligosaccharide serves as a chaperone for the LpL. We hypothesize that other HS oligosaccharides may serve a similar function to aid in the transport and stabilization of heparin binding proteins. Bovine endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as described (26Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells (5–15 passages) were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Brown fat cells (BFC-1B) were grown on collagen (type III, Sigma)-coated six-well tissue culture plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) as described previously (27Sasaki A. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15198-15204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15 mm Hepes buffer, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 17 μm pantothenate, 33 μmbiotin, 1% glutamine, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Two days after seeding, the confluent cells were converted to adipocytes by incubation in differentiation medium (the same medium supplemented with 10 nm insulin and 2 nm triiodothyronine). The medium was changed every 1–2 days, and the cells were used for experiments at 14–20 days after confluence. To confirm that the cells were producing LpL, LpL activity was measured before each experiment using a glycerol triolein emulsion (28Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (29Saxena U. Witte L.D. Goldberg I.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 470-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LpL was purified from fresh bovine milk as described previously (29Saxena U. Witte L.D. Goldberg I.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 470-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) following the method of Socorro et al. (30Socorro L. Green C.C. Jackson R.L. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C. Purified LpL was radioiodinated (29Saxena U. Witte L.D. Goldberg I.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 470-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase enzymes (Sigma). The reaction mixture containing purified LpL (800 μg), 20 mm glucose, 1 mCi of Na125I (Amersham Corp.), lactoperoxidase 7.5 mg/ml, and glucose oxidase 1 mg/ml was incubated in 50 mm of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, for 5 min on ice. The mixture was then applied to a column containing 3 ml of heparin-agarose gel (Bio-Rad). The column was washed first with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 mNaCl and then with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.75 m NaCl. Radioiodinated LpL was then eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.5m NaCl and 0.1% BSA. 125I-LpL was stored at −70 °C. A typical preparation had a specific activity of about 800–1000 cpm/ng LpL and greater than 90% of the counts were precipitable by 10% trichloroacetic acid. Heparitinase (heparan sulfate lyase or heparanase) and heparinase (heparin lyase) purified from Flavobacterium heparinum was obtained from Seikagaku America Inc., Bethesda, MD. Confluent monolayers of endothelial cells were washed with MEM and incubated with MEM, 3% BSA for 16 h. The medium (ECCM) was collected and filtered through a 0.8-μm filter to remove cell debris and used to release LpL from BFC-1 adipocytes. In other experiments lysophosphatidylcholine was added to a final concentration of 50 μm to MEM, 3% BSA and then incubated with endothelial cells for 16 h, and medium (lyso-ECCM) was collected (31Sivaram P. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Release of LpL activity and125I-LpL was studied. To assess the effects of ECCM, adipocyte monolayers were incubated with MEM, 3% BSA or ECCM at 37 °C for 1 h. LpL activity released was assayed using triolein emulsions as described previously (29Saxena U. Witte L.D. Goldberg I.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 470-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-LpL binding to BFC-1 adipocytes was carried out as described previously (32Sasaki A. Sivaram P. Goldberg I.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E880-E888PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin-releasable LpL associated with the cell surface was assessed after incubating the cells in 1 ml of MEM, 3% BSA containing 10 units/ml heparin. Purified bovine LpL and adipocyte LpL released by heparitinase or by lyso-ECCM were incubated at 37 °C for up to 1 h. Aliquots at different time intervals were assayed for LpL activity. In other experiments purified bovine LpL was first incubated with HS or heparitinase-digested HS for 10 min on ice before incubating at 37 °C. 25 μg of purified bovine LpL was incubated with 8 μg of HS (bovine intestine,M r = 40,000) for 20 min at room temperature. The complex was then incubated with 5 units of heparitinase for 2–3 h at 30 °C. The mixture was heat-denatured at 95 °C for 20 min. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant containing the heparitinase-digested HS (HS oligo) was used for the experiments. For transport experiments 125I-LpL was mixed with undigested HS or HS oligo and used (see below). An LpL binding decasaccharide (Deca) of the following composition (IdceA(2-SO4)-GlcNSO4(6-SO4))3(IdceA(2-SO4)-GlcNSO4)(IdceA-GlcNSO4(6-SO4)) was isolated from commercial heparin (Ming Han, Oakland, CA) by partial depolymerization with nitrous acid, followed by Bio-Gel P-6 and polylysine-agarose chromatography (33Parthasarathy N. Wagner W.D. McGee M. FASEB J. 1996; 10 (abstr.): 1726Google Scholar). Heparanase (HSPG degrading) activity was assayed using matrix prepared from35SO4-labeled endothelial cells. Confluent monolayers of endothelial cells were incubated with35SO4 containing medium for 48 h. Subendothelial matrix was prepared from labeled cells as described previously (34Stins M.F. Maxfield F.R. Goldberg I.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled matrix was incubated with ECCM, lyso-ECCM, or heparinase for 2–4 h at 37 °C, and released radioactivity was determined. Adipocyte proteoglycans were labeled by incubating the cells for 24 h in medium containing 50 μCi/ml 35SO4 (32Sasaki A. Sivaram P. Goldberg I.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E880-E888PubMed Google Scholar). Following removal of the radiolabeling media, the cells were washed and incubated with medium, ECCM, or lyso-ECCM for up to 4 h at 37 °C. Released35SO4 was counted at different time points. Transport experiments were done using tissue culture inserts (Falcon) in 6-well plates as described previously (34Stins M.F. Maxfield F.R. Goldberg I.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inserts were coated with 0.1% gelatin for 30 min at room temperature followed by a mixture containing collagen (50 μg per ml) and fibronectin (10 μg per ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with PBS followed by MEM, 3% BSA. Endothelial cells were plated (∼3 × 106 cells per well), and experiments were done 2 days after seeding. Endothelial cells cultured under these conditions are polarized and form a tight barrier (34Stins M.F. Maxfield F.R. Goldberg I.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).125I-LpL, 125I-LpL + HS, or125I-LpL + HS oligo was added to the bottom chamber in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 3% BSA. 125I label appearing in the upper and lower media was measured after 90 min. To determine if heparanase and LpL activities correlate, epididymal fat was obtained from male rats in the morning (feeding) or 16 h after their food had been removed (fasting). Epididymal fat was isolated and homogenized (polytron) in 2 volumes of phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.02% CHAPS. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted with an equal volume of buffer and assayed for HSPG degrading activity using subendothelial matrix containing 35SO4-labeled proteoglycans. To specifically assess heparanase, lysate was mixed with 100 units/ml heparin before adding to matrix. To determine if endothelial cells secrete factors that can release LpL from adipocytes, ECCM was added to adipocytes containing cell surface LpL and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Fig. 1 shows that, compared with control medium, ECCM released 2-fold more LpL activity into the medium. Previous studies from this laboratory (31Sivaram P. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that lysolecithin, a product of lipolysis, stimulated endothelial cells to produce a heparanase-like activity. We therefore tested whether media from lysolecithin-stimulated endothelial cells would release more LPL. As expected, lyso-ECCM released 3–4-fold more LpL activity than ECCM. The amount of LpL released by lyso-ECCM was similar to that released by heparinase/heparitinase (1 unit/ml each). Although lysolecithin will release LpL from adipocytes, this is prevented by inclusion of albumin in the medium (27Sasaki A. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15198-15204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since addition of lysophosphatidylcholine directly to ECCM did not affect the amount of LpL released (not shown), the releasing factor could not be the lysolecithin itself. Therefore, endothelial cells secrete LpL releasing factors, and LpL release is greater using lyso-ECCM.Figure 1Lysophosphatidylcholine stimulates the production of LpL releasing factor. Medium was obtained from endothelial cells that had been incubated either with MEM, 3% BSA (ECCM) or MEM, 3% BSA containing 50 μmlysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-ECCM) for 16 h at 37 °C. Differentiated adipocytes were incubated with control medium, medium containing heparinase/heparitinase (H'ase) (1 unit/ml each), ECCM containing 50 μm lysophosphatidylcholine, or with lyso-ECCM for up to 30 min at 37 °C. Released LpL activity (nmol of free fatty acid released) was assessed at different time points. Lyso-ECCM released 3–6-fold more adipocyte LpL than control medium and 3-fold more LpL than ECCM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We previously showed, by size analysis of the HS degradation products generated from subendothelial matrix HSPG, that lyso-ECCM contains an HSPG degrading activity similar to heparinase (31Sivaram P. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine whether the heparanase-like activity in lyso-ECCM would degrade adipocyte cell surface PG, adipocyte PG were labeled with35SO4 and incubated with control medium, ECCM or lyso-ECCM (Fig. 2). Bacterial heparitinase was used as a control. 35S in control medium, representing the secreted pool of adipocyte proteoglycans, was subtracted to specifically determine the effects of conditioned media and heparitinase. Incubation with ECCM led to a small increase in the amount of labeled PG appearing in the medium. Lyso-ECCM released even more 35S label into the medium, and this amount of label was identical to that released by heparitinase. These data show that the heparanase-like activity in lyso-ECCM will degrade cell surface HSPG. Only heparanase secreted from the abluminal side of the endothelial cell will interact with adipocytes in vivo. We therefore tested whether heparanase was secreted from the basolateral side of polarized endothelial cells. Cells were grown in control or lysophosphatidylcholine containing medium for 12 h, and heparanase activity was assayed in media from top (luminal) and bottom (subendothelial) chambers (Fig. 3). In total, cells exposed to lysophosphatidylcholine had 2.5–3-fold more heparanase activity. In addition, the lyso-ECCM from the bottom chamber contained approximately 40% more activity per ml than the top chamber. When adjusted for the volume differences, the bottom chamber contained 3.5-fold more heparanase. If a similar situation exists in vivo, heparanase would be preferentially secreted into the subendothelial space. To more directly test whether ECCM could release adipocyte LpL, we performed a coculture experiment. LpL release was studied during lipolysis on the endothelial surface, a process that produces lysolecithin (27Sasaki A. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15198-15204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and with lysolecithin containing medium. Endothelial cells were grown to confluence on filters,125I-LpL was permitted to bind to cultured adipocytes, and filters containing endothelial cells were then placed above the adipocytes. To the endothelial cells in the top chamber, media were added containing 10 μg/ml unlabeled bovine LpL, 10 μg/ml VLDL, LpL + VLDL, or 50 μm lysolecithin. The cells were incubated for an additional 6 h, a time previously shown to result in heparanase production (31Sivaram P. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); 125I-LpL appearing in the media of lower chamber (representing LpL release from adipocyte) and top chamber (LpL transport) was counted. Addition of unlabeled LpL to the endothelial cells did not affect the amount of 125I-LpL released from the adipocyte cell surface or transported (Fig.4). Addition of VLDL to endothelial cells led to a 15% increase in the amount of 125I-LpL appearing in the top chamber. LpL + VLDL and lysolecithin increased LpL released into the media by >25% and increased transport to the upper chamber by 45 and 51%, respectively. These data suggest that lipolysis and lipolysis products stimulate endothelial cells to acquire LpL from adipocytes. To effectively function on the luminal side of the endothelium in vivo, adipocyte LpL, following its release, must maintain its activity during its transport to endothelium. We, therefore, tested whether lyso-ECCM released LpL activity is stable. Adipocytes were incubated with either lyso-ECCM or heparitinase for 1 h at 37 °C. Media containing released adipocyte LpL were collected and then further incubated at 37 °C for up to 1 h. LpL activity was determined at different time intervals. Purified bovine LpL was used as a control. Purified LpL lost 60% of its activity in 15 min and >95% of its activity in 60 min when incubated in PBS (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, lyso-ECCM released LpL lost very little (<2%) activity even after 60 min. Heparitinase released LpL was also stable and lost only 20–25% activity in 30 and 60 min. We hypothesized that LpL, both heparitinase released and endothelial heparanase released, was able to maintain its activity because it was associated with a small piece(s) of HS oligosaccharide. In our experiments, we observed that when LpL was released by lyso-ECCM from35SO4-labeled HSPG, a fragment of35S-labeled GAG could be copurified with LpL on heparin-Sepharose chromatography (not shown). To confirm that HS oligo, resulting from heparanase treatment, stabilizes LpL, LpL was mixed with undigested HS or HS oligo (generated as described under “Material and Methods”) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. LpL even in 1% albumin-containing buffers lost approximately 65% of its activity in 60 min (Fig. 5 B). As expected, in the presence of HS LpL retained >80% of its initial activity after 60 min. In addition, the smaller HS oligo was just as effective. These results further suggest that small HS oligo associated with LpL can stabilize LpL from inactivation. We next tested whether LpL associated with HS oligos can be transported across the endothelium and interact with the luminal side of the endothelium. Because lyso-ECCM applied to adipocytes contains secreted proteoglycans and other adipocyte factors that might interfere with LpL transport in addition to released LpL itself, we used LpL·HS oligo complex, as generated above, for these experiments.125I-LpL, 125I-LpL-HS, or125I-LpL-HS oligo were added to the bottom chamber of endothelial cell monolayers and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. The amount of LpL that appeared in the upper chamber medium after 90 min was slightly less with HS compared with controls (∼18%) and slightly more with HS oligo (128% of controls, not shown). HS also decreased the amount of 125I-LpL associating with the cell surface after 90 min of incubation by approximately 26% (Fig.6). HS oligo increased the amount of LpL associating with the cell surface by more than 2-fold. Thus, these data show that HS oligo not only stabilizes LpL activity but also promotes LpL transport across and association with endothelial cells. The size of the HS oligo is not known. The above experiments suggest that, despite the well known fact that heparin dissociates LpL from endothelial cells, small HS-derived oligos do not prevent LpL binding to endothelial cells. To directly test this, we used a previously described HS decasaccharide (Deca, approximate molecular mass of 2800 Da) that has a high affinity for LpL (11Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Folry D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now tested if Deca also facilitates LpL binding to endothelial cells and stabilizes its activity (Fig. 7). Unfractionated low molecular weight heparin (molecular mass of 3000 Da) was used as a control.125I-LpL was mixed with different concentrations of heparin or Deca (normalized for the amount of uronic acid) and incubated with endothelial cells, and cell surface binding was assessed. LpL binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by heparin and at 100 ng of uronic acid concentration, heparin inhibited LpL binding by >75%. In contrast, Deca even at higher concentrations of uronic acid (up to 1000 ng) did not inhibit LpL binding. In addition, Deca also stabilized LpL activity (inset). Therefore, HS-oligo containing as few as 10 saccharides can stabilize LpL without inhibiting LpL association with endothelial cells. Our hypothesis is that lipolysis on the endothelial surface leads to production of endothelial cell heparanase and that this enzyme, in turn, permits more LpL to transit from adipocytes to its stable binding site on the endothelial cells. As a first experiment to test this hypothesis, we assessed whether heparanase activity in adipose tissues is modulated in vivo in a manner consistent with this hypothesis. Epididymal fat was isolated from feeding and overnight fasting rats. Tissue was homogenized and tested for LpL activity and HSPG degrading activity. Since crude homogenates may contain other activities (such as proteases) that can degrade HSPG, we used heparin inhibition to specifically assess heparanase activity. Total adipose HSPG degrading activity was approximately 1.6-fold higher in feeding compared with fasting rat fat pads (Fig. 8). The heparin-inhibitable HSPG degrading activity (difference betweenopen bars and closed bars, representing heparanase activity) was 2.1-fold higher in feeding rat adipose. A similar increase in LpL activity was also found after feeding (inset). These data show that adipose heparanase activity is modulated, and greater activity is found when LpL activity is increased. One special aspect of the metabolism of LpL is that its actions require extensive extracellular transport. Unlike the traditional secretory protein, newly synthesized LpL appears to reside, at least transiently, on the surface of its cell of synthesis. Immunohistochemical studies (35Jonasson L. Hansson G.B. Bengtsson G.B. Olivecrona T. Atherosclerosis. 1984; 51: 313-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and experiments using cultured adipocytes (36Camps L. Reina M. Llobera M. Vilaro S. Olivecrona T. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C673-C681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Cisar L.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that LpL is associated with the cell surface. More recently, experiments in LpL overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated that cells that had a reduced amount of cell surface HSPG secreted more LpL into the media and had less LpL on the cell surface (38Berryman D.E. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24525-24531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, lack of HSPG prevents LpL association with the cell surface. One way adipocytes can lose cell surface HSPG in vivo is via the actions of heparanase. Our data show that endothelial cells can produce a heparanase that releases LpL from adipocytes and suggest that LpL's transit to the endothelial cells is initiated by the actions of this enzyme. The greatest amount of LpL release was found using lyso-ECCM. Although lysophosphatidylcholine is often thought of as a product of lipoprotein oxidation, it is also a lipolysis product. Aside from its actions as a triglyceride hydrolase, LpL is a phospholipase with a predilection for fatty acids in the S n1 position (39Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus if our in vitro observations mimic in vivophysiology, the initial lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins on the adipocyte capillary lumen should stimulate the production of the endothelial cell heparanase. This should, in turn, promote the release of more LpL from the adipocyte surface allowing the continuation of the lipolysis reaction. This new LpL is required because some of the endothelial LpL is released during this process (40Saxena U. Witte L.D. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4349-4355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data with rat adipose is consistent with this hypothesis. More LpL and more heparanase activities were found in epididymal fat obtained from feeding than fasting rats. This further suggests, but does not prove, that LpL and heparanase activities are mutually regulated. Several lines of evidence suggested that the releasing activity was a heparanase and not a protease. It released LpL in its active form, and the released LpL was stable over time. Concomitant with LpL release adipocyte cell surface PG were also released. The HSPG degrading activity was 1) inhibited by heparin and suramin, heparanase inhibitors (31Sivaram P. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and 2) bound to a heparin affinity column and eluted at 0.75m NaCl. 2S. Pillarisetti and I. J. Goldberg, unpublished observations. In addition, using35SO4-labeled subendothelial matrix as a substrate we have shown that the degradation products released by lyso-ECCM were similar in size to those released by heparitinase (31Sivaram P. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). LpL released by endothelial heparanase or heparitinase was able to maintain its activity even after separation from cells. This was most likely due to LpL association with a small piece of HS oligo. That HS oligo stabilizes LpL was confirmed using purified heparitinase-digested HS and Deca. We hypothesize that Deca is a protected fragment of heparanase digestion of adipocyte HSPG. The regions of adipocyte cell surface HSPG that are occupied by LpL are not readily accessible to heparanase, and therefore, unoccupied regions of HSPG may be preferentially cleaved leading to the release of LpL·Deca complexes. This piece of oligosaccharide can prevent LpL from denaturation during its course of travel from adipocyte to endothelial cell surfaces. For this reason, the LpL binding HS oligo is an “extracellular chaperone” for LpL. Our data in Fig. 6 show that the HS oligo, in addition to stabilizing LpL activity, also promoted LpL transport across the endothelial cell barrier. We were, however, surprised by the observation that HS oligo + LpL complex was able to associate with endothelial cells better than control LpL. We also found that the LpL-binding Deca stabilized LpL, and at different concentrations (up to 1000 ng of uronic acid) did not inhibit LpL binding to endothelial cells. Thus, a similar size oligosaccharide may be released from adipocyte HSPG by heparanase. This oligo permits LpL to cross the endothelial barrier, whereas larger undigested HS impedes this process. The stabilized LpL that arrives on the luminal endothelial surface is then able to bind to the cells, whereas native LpL that has been inactivated during this process does not associate with these cells. We tested this hypothesis using a coculture system (Fig. 4) and showed that even under the disadvantageous conditions used, LpL release from adipocytes was promoted when endothelial cells were stimulated with lysolecithin or with LpL-mediated lipolysis of VLDL. To maximize our ability to measure the LpL we used radioiodinated proteins. Although the magnitude of the increase in LpL release from the adipocytes (the amount found in the lower chamber) was only 25–30% greater using the stimulated endothelial cells, this was found in a system in which the endothelial cells and adipocytes were widely separated and contained 2.5 ml of intervening culture media. In vivo, these cells are almost juxtaposed and the secreted heparanase would not be diluted to a similar extent. Nonetheless, the amount of LpL in the upper chamber was increased almost 50%. These data are consistent with those in Fig. 6 that show more LpL-oligo on the upper (luminal) side of polarized endothelial cells after addition of the LpL to the lower chamber. It should be noted that a similar increase in LpL associated with the endothelial surface was not found in the coculture experiment shown in Fig. 4. This is presumably because any LpL associated with the cell surface endothelial cells was released into the medium by lysolecithin and other lipolysis products (32Sasaki A. Sivaram P. Goldberg I.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E880-E888PubMed Google Scholar). Why did the oligosaccharide not inhibit LpL binding to endothelial cells? This may be due to one or more of the following. 1) The HS oligo kept LpL in the right conformation to interact with endothelial cell surface HSPG. The HS oligo must be neither too large nor too charged to inhibit LpL binding to HSPG. A similar situation exists for FGF. FGF has a higher affinity for a hexasaccharide; however, a longer 14-unit oligosaccharide is required for its release from cells (41Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The HS oligo dissociated from LpL during the course of transport and before LpL interaction with endothelial HSPG. 3) Several heparin binding domains on LpL have been described (42Berryman D.E. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3272-3276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.-M. Cambillau C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21499-21504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, some of these HS binding domains of LpL were available for interaction with endothelial surface HSPG even in the presence of the oligosaccharide. This, we believe, is the reason why low molecular weight heparin inhibited LpL binding and Deca did not. Heparin, although similar in size, contains a heterogeneous population of saccharides with different sequences. Some of these may bind, albeit nonspecifically, to different regions of LpL preventing its interaction with other proteins or HSPG. 4) HS oligo·LpL complexes associated with non-HSPG LpL binding proteins. One such candidate protein on endothelial cells that can bind LpL with high affinity is the recently described 116-kDa amino-terminal fragment of apoB (45Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Sivaram P. Vanni-Reyes T. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15261-15266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Preliminary observations showed that Deca did not inhibit LPL binding to apoB (not shown). 5) HS oligo·LpL complexes interacted with endothelial cells via the HS oligo. Several endothelial cell surface molecules bind to glycosaminoglycans (47Nelson R.M. Venot A. Bevilacqua M.P. Linhardt R.J. Stamenkovic I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 601-631Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). They include cell surface adhesion molecules such as selectins, integrins, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and cadherins. There may be other unstable proteins for which HS oligosaccharides serve as chaperones. Although bFGF and other cytokines have high affinity protein receptors, their biological effects are potentiated by complexation with HSPG or exogenous heparin (48Klagsburn M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 49Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that HS keeps the bFGF in a conformation required for binding to its receptor. Similarly HS modulate the activities of antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, protease nexin-1, and interferon-γ (5Busch C. Owen W.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 50Maimone M.M. Tollefson D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Our data, however, are unique in showing that a fragment of HS can facilitate the intercellular movement of a protein. LpL movement from the adipocyte to the endothelial cell surface appears, at least in part, to regulate LpL activity in vivo. We hypothesize that in vivo HS oligosaccharide facilitates this process by maintaining LpL conformation and activity. Thus, a fragment of HS derived from the actions of endothelial heparanase may be a critical factor in the delivery of energy to cells."

The mature glycoprotein is transported from the Golgi to the melanosome where melanin biosynthesis occurs. In this study, we have investigated the effects of inhibitors of N-glycan processing on the synthesis, transport, and catalytic activity of tyrosinase. When B16 mouse melanoma cells were cultured in the presence ofN-butyldeoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum-processing enzymes α-glucosidases I and II, the enzyme was synthesized and transported to the melanosome but almost completely lacked catalytic activity. The cells contained only 2% of the melanin found in untreated cells. Structural analysis of theN-glycans from N-butyldeoxynojirimycin-treated B16 cells demonstrated that three oligosaccharide structures (Glc3Man7–9) predominated. Removal of the glucose residues with α-glucosidases I and II failed to restore enzymatic activity, suggesting that the glucosylatedN-glycans do not sterically interfere with the enzyme's active sites. The mannosidase inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin had no effect on catalytic activity suggesting that the retention of glucosylated N-glycans results in the inactivation of this enzyme. The retention of glucosylated N-glycans does not therefore result in misfolding and degradation of the glycoprotein, as the enzyme is transported to the melanosome, but may cause conformational changes in its catalytic domains.

The retention of glucosylated N-glycans does not therefore result in misfolding and degradation of the glycoprotein, as the enzyme is transported to the melanosome, but may cause conformational changes in its catalytic domains. N-Glycans can influence the properties of the protein to which they are conjugated in a number of different ways (1Paulson J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 2Dwek R.A. Science. 1992; 269: 1234-1235Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). In many cases N-glycans are required for protein folding, although there are examples where the addition of N-glycans to the protein is not required in order for the protein to fold (4Parodi A.J. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 1-12Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Each glycoprotein must therefore be studied on a case by case basis to determine what influence the N-glycan has on the biological and physical properties of a given glycoprotein. One strategy for studying the role(s) of N-glycosylation involves the use of specific inhibitors of N-linked oligosaccharide processing, such as α-glucosidase I inhibitors (5Winchester B. Fleet G.W.J. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In the presence of these compounds the nascent polypeptide is glycosylated co-translationally through the transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 from dolichol to the Asn residue of the Asn-X-Ser/Thr glycosylation sequon. However, the subsequent enzymatic processing steps, initiated in the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NB-DNJ, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin; DMJ, deoxymannojirimycin; DOPA, β-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; B16, untreated B16 melanoma cells; B16+NB-DNJ, B16 melanoma cells incubated in the presence of NB-DNJ; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; endo H, endoglycosidase H. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NB-DNJ, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin; DMJ, deoxymannojirimycin; DOPA, β-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; B16, untreated B16 melanoma cells; B16+NB-DNJ, B16 melanoma cells incubated in the presence of NB-DNJ; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; endo H, endoglycosidase H. by the action of α-glucosidase I, which removes the outer α-1,2-linked glucose residue from the oligosaccharide, followed by removal of the remaining two glucose residues in the ER by α-glucosidase II, are prevented (6Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3752) Google Scholar).N-Glycosylated glycoproteins are therefore produced that lack hybrid and complex type oligosaccharide structures. The actions of inhibitors of α-glucosidases I and II, such as the imino sugar deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and its N-alkylated derivatives, have been extensively characterized in cellular and viral systems (7Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of these compounds, most N-glycans are arrested as glucosylated structures and undergo no further processing. However some glucosylated N-glycans are processed via the Golgi endomannosidase, even in cells treated with high concentrations of α-glucosidase inhibitors (8Lubas W.A. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3775-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The correct folding of some glycoproteins is regulated within the ER through the interaction of the unfolded glycoprotein with calnexin and calreticulin, which have been shown to have chaperone-like functions (9Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 10Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20298-20304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Monoglucosylated, partially folded glycoproteins are bound by calnexin and retained in the ER until correct or complete folding takes place (11Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins bound to calnexin are released through the action of α-glucosidase II and if they are still incompletely folded can be reglucosylated through the action of an ER-soluble glucosyltransferase, which only recognizes denatured domains on glycoproteins (4Parodi A.J. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 1-12Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 10Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20298-20304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The re-glucosylated glycoprotein can then rebind to calnexin, and folding can continue. Calnexin binds poorly to glycoproteins carrying three untrimmed glucose residues, as it preferentially recognizes monoglucosylated species (11Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, α-glucosidase inhibitors have minimal effects on cell viability and secretion (12Platt F.M. Karlsson G.B. Jacob G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and cell lines deficient in α-glucosidases have a relatively normal phenotype (13Stanley P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that alternative mechanisms exist within cells to enable the correct folding of many glycoproteins to occur, when they are prevented from interacting with their chaperones.The effects of α-glucosidase inhibition on cellular glycoproteins are selective (14Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For example, the transferrin receptor requires correct oligosaccharide processing for cell surface expression, whereas other cell surface glycoproteins in the same cell line are expressed normally (12Platt F.M. Karlsson G.B. Jacob G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The common observation in mammalian systems is that some glucosylated glycoproteins fold normally (presumably those that are calnexin-independent or utilize other chaperones during their folding), whereas others fail to fold completely and are retained in the ER prior to degradation (15Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2107-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As yet we have no insight into predicting the fate of a given glycoprotein when synthesized in a cell treated with inhibitors of α-glucosidase I. We also have little information concerning whether a glycoprotein can remain partially misfolded in one domain of the protein, as a result of retaining glucosylatedN-glycans, while other domains adopt a relatively normal conformation and are recognized by the appropriate effector molecules within the cell.The vast majority of studies to date have focused almost exclusively on the role of N-glycans on glycoproteins destined for secretion or cell surface expression. However, little information is available on the behavior of intracellular glycoproteins or glycosylated enzymes in α-glucosidase inhibited cells. In this study, we have investigated the function of an intracellular enzyme when it carries only glucosylated N-glycans by treating the cells with an inhibitor of α-glucosidase I. We have studied tyrosinase (monophenol, 3,4-β-dihydroxyphenylalanine oxygen oxidoreductase, EC1.14.18.1), which plays a pivotal role in melanogenesis. It is a single chain glycoprotein catalyzing the hydroxylation of tyrosine to β-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and the oxidation of DOPA to DOPA quinone (16Hearing V.J. Ekel T.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase is specifically synthesized within melanocytes, where it transits through the ER and Golgi and is transported to specialized intracellular organelles termed melanosomes (17Laskin J.D. Piccinini L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16626-16635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of tyrosinase is dependent upon the possession of two copper binding sites. At each of these sites three histidine residues co-ordinate the copper atom, and both of the copper atoms co-ordinate an O2 molecule (18Jolley Jr., R.L. Evans L.H. Makino N. Mason H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 335-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From a total of six potential glycosylation sites, three are located within or in close proximity to the active site domains (19Muller G. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Schultz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).In this report we demonstrate an almost complete loss of tyrosinase activity following treatment of B16 mouse melanoma cells with the α-glucosidase I inhibitor N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ). Despite the modification in the N-linked oligosaccharide structure, the enzyme was transported correctly to the melanosome, but was functionally inactive and therefore failed to initiate melanin biosynthesis. These results suggest that glucosylated immature N-glycans do not prevent the transport of tyrosinase to its specific cellular organelle but that its conformation may be altered such that there is a profound influence on its enzymatic activity.DISCUSSIONIn this report we have examined the effects of inhibitingN-glycan processing, using the α-glucosidase inhibitor NB-DNJ, on the biological properties of murine tyrosinase. We have found that, in contrast to some other glucosylated glycoproteins (12Platt F.M. Karlsson G.B. Jacob G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,15Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2107-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme does not misfold in the presence of glucosylatedN-glycans to a degree that causes it to be retained in the ER and degraded. Instead it is transported to its correct cellular location, namely the melanosome. Indeed, the amounts of tyrosinase immunoprecipitated from the melanosomes of B16 and B16+NB-DNJ cells are comparable, showing that similar levels of B16 and B16+NB-DNJ tyrosinase are synthesized and transported to the correct organelle, irrespective of theirN-glycan composition. This implies that either the folding of the protein in regions required for transport must be comparable with the native molecule or that the transport is independent of its folding. However, despite correct localization this enzyme has virtually no catalytic activity in B16+NB-DNJ cells, and therefore the cells cannot support melanogenesis, and they are profoundly deficient in pigment relative to B16 cells.Tyrosinase is a bifunctional enzyme in that it catalyzes the hydroxylation of tyrosine to DOPA (the rate-limiting step in melanin biosynthesis) and the oxidation of DOPA to DOPA quinone. For the first step, tyrosinase requires DOPA as a co-factor, and the enzyme has been proposed to contain two catalytic sites involved in the binding of tyrosine and DOPA, respectively (16Hearing V.J. Ekel T.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Tyrosine hydroxylase activity in NB-DNJ-treated B16 cells is diminished to 15% of its normal activity and DOPA oxidase activity to 5%, indicating that both catalytic sites have been affected. Upon removal of NB-DNJ from the culture medium the cells re-synthesize tyrosinase, and therefore both activities (tyrosine hydroxylase and DOPA oxidase) of the enzyme can be detected in cell extracts within 24–72 h. Tyrosinase dysfunction in B16+NB-DNJ cells is also indicated by the marked de-pigmentation of these cells due to the incapacity of the B16+NB-DNJ tyrosinase to initiate melanin biosynthesis. Conversely, others have reported that the overall activity of mouse tyrosinase is not inhibited when B16 cells are incubated (for 11–25 days) with glucosamine, a weak glucosidase inhibitor, despite the loss of pigmentation (28Imokawa G. Mishima Y. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1994-2002PubMed Google Scholar, 29Imokawa G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results, obtained by monitoring enzyme activity, were interpreted as an indication that some isoforms of tyrosinase fail to reach the melanosome. In contrast, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments, performed in this study, have shown that B16+NB-DNJ tyrosinase is correctly transported to the melanosomes. Further support comes from the report of the effects of α-glucosidase inhibitors on human tyrosinase (30Takahashi H. Parsons P.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 481-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The enzyme was still synthesized in the human cell line MM96E, but had no activity and therefore the cells were nonpigmented (30Takahashi H. Parsons P.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 481-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is therefore analogous to our findings with NB-DNJ-treated B16 mouse melanoma cells. Moreover, Triton X-114 extraction of the B16+NB-DNJ cells demonstrated that B16+NB-DNJtyrosinase is correctly incorporated in the melanosomal membrane in an analogous fashion to the B16 tyrosinase. For melanogenesis this is an important observation, as it is known that even if the enzyme is active immediately after completion of its synthesis, melanin synthesis is only initiated after tyrosinase reaches the melanosomal membrane (27Hearing V.J. Ekel T.M. Montague P.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Correct insertion of B16+NB-DNJ tyrosinase into the membrane suggests that the de-pigmentation observed in B16+cells is due to inactivity of tyrosinase, rather than its incorrect transport. In addition, the same low level of activity of B16+NB-DNJ tyrosinase was found both in melanosomal and microsomal fractions, suggesting that inactivation does not occur during, or as a consequence of, defective transport. On the other hand, direct incubation of untreated cell lysates with NB-DNJ results in the detection of normal levels of tyrosinase activity. This shows that NB-DNJ does not act as a direct inhibitor of this enzyme but that it causes an indirect effect on tyrosinase activity, presumably through the alteration in N-glycan structure. We conclude that B16+NB-DNJ tyrosinase is therefore synthesized in an inactive form. Digestion with PNGase F revealed that B16+NB-DNJ tyrosinase is synthesized as a 60-kDa polypeptide. The same molecular weight was obtained for PNGase-treated B16 tyrosinase. This is in agreement with the predicted polypeptide molecular weight based on the tyrosinase cDNA, which predicts 533 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of 58–60 kDa (19Muller G. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Schultz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Following co- and post-translational attachment of carbohydrates, the molecular mass of B16 tyrosinase increases to approximately 72 kDa (19Muller G. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Schultz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Mature B16+NB-DNJ tyrosinase has a molecular mass of only 69 kDa, 3 kDa less than B16 tyrosinase. This indicates that the differences in molecular mass appear to be at the post-translational level and are related to differences in the oligosaccharide moiety.Analysis of B16+NB-DNJ tyrosinase oligosaccharide sequences revealed the existence of glucosylated oligosaccharides, including Glc3Man9, Glc3Man8,and Glc3Man7, which is in agreement with theN-glycan structures found on gp120 expressed in the presence of NB-DNJ (31Karlsson G.B. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The small percentage of more processedN-glycan structures observed could explain the low level of residual tyrosinase activity observed in this study and may result from the action of the Golgi endomannosidase (8Lubas W.A. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3775-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that the untreated tyrosinase has a mixture of high mannose and complex type oligosaccharides. Similar N-glycan profiles have been reported for hamster tyrosinase (23Ohkura T. Yamashita K. Mishima Y. Kobata A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar),suggesting that there is a degree of conservation of tyrosinase N-glycan structures among at least two mammalian species.To determine whether the lack of complex N-glycans was sufficient to render tyrosinase inactive, B16 cells were treated with DMJ, an inhibitor of Golgi α-1,2-mannosidase. Tyrosinase was rendered partially sensitive to endo H following treatment of B16 cells with DMJ. However, there was no effect on tyrosinase activity, suggesting that the absence of complex type N-glycan structures is not responsible for the maintenance of tyrosinase in an active form. Furthermore, these data suggest that retention of glucosylated high mannose structures, due to NB-DNJ treatment, directly results in the loss of tyrosinase activity. This is not due to the glucosylatedN-glycan directly interfering with the catalytic site as was shown by removing the three glucose residues, which did not restore enzyme activity. The loss of activity therefore may result from partial misfolding of the catalytic site, possibly showing that folding of this domain is chaperone dependent. It is interesting to note that the transport to the melanosome remains normal. Perhaps this illustrates that the overall conformation of this protein occurs by independent domain folding mechanisms.Similar conclusions have been drawn from studies of human immunodeficiency virus glycoproteins expressed in NB-DNJ-treated Chinese hamster ovary cells (32Fischer P.B. Karlsson G.B. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7143-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of gp120 was probed using a panel of over 40 monoclonal antibodies. It was found that most of the regions of gp120 expressed in the presence of NB-DNJ (gp120+) were indistinguishable from gp120 expressed in the absence of the compound (gp120−). Furthermore, the gp120+ retained its ability to bind to CD4 with an affinity comparable with gp120−. However, when the conformation of the V1/V2 loops were investigated, it was found that this region was affected by the retention of glucosylated N-glycans. This alteration in antibody recognition was attributed to a change in the conformation of this region of the molecule. It is of interest that gp120+ transits through the ER and Golgi and is secreted from the cell at comparable rates relative to gp120−, yet has localized conformational changes due to retention of glucosylatedN-glycans during protein folding (32Fischer P.B. Karlsson G.B. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7143-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that the retention of glucosylated N-glycans results in the loss of catalytic activity but does not impair intracellular transport. As a consequence, melanogenesis is blocked due to the pivotal nature of this enzyme in the melanin biosynthetic pathway. Inactivation of tyrosinase may result from the failure of the enzyme to bind copper either through changes in the conformation of the active site in the presence of glucosylated N-glycans or indirectly due to impaired copper transport within the cell. Another possibility is that the protein undergoes independent domain folding with the active site conformation being critically dependent on the interaction of the protein with chaperones during its folding. The mechanism(s) of tyrosinase inactivation in NB-DNJ-treated cells is currently under investigation. N-Glycans can influence the properties of the protein to which they are conjugated in a number of different ways (1Paulson J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 2Dwek R.A. Science. 1992; 269: 1234-1235Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). In many cases N-glycans are required for protein folding, although there are examples where the addition of N-glycans to the protein is not required in order for the protein to fold (4Parodi A.J. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 1-12Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Each glycoprotein must therefore be studied on a case by case basis to determine what influence the N-glycan has on the biological and physical properties of a given glycoprotein. One strategy for studying the role(s) of N-glycosylation involves the use of specific inhibitors of N-linked oligosaccharide processing, such as α-glucosidase I inhibitors (5Winchester B.

In the presence of these compounds the nascent polypeptide is glycosylated co-translationally through the transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 from dolichol to the Asn residue of the Asn-X-Ser/Thr glycosylation sequon.

Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3752) Google Scholar).N-Glycosylated glycoproteins are therefore produced that lack hybrid and complex type oligosaccharide structures. The actions of inhibitors of α-glucosidases I and II, such as the imino sugar deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and its N-alkylated derivatives, have been extensively characterized in cellular and viral systems (7Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of these compounds, most N-glycans are arrested as glucosylated structures and undergo no further processing. However some glucosylated N-glycans are processed via the Golgi endomannosidase, even in cells treated with high concentrations of α-glucosidase inhibitors (8Lubas W.A. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3775-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The correct folding of some glycoproteins is regulated within the ER through the interaction of the unfolded glycoprotein with calnexin and calreticulin, which have been shown to have chaperone-like functions (9Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 10Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20298-20304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Monoglucosylated, partially folded glycoproteins are bound by calnexin and retained in the ER until correct or complete folding takes place (11Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins bound to calnexin are released through the action of α-glucosidase II and if they are still incompletely folded can be reglucosylated through the action of an ER-soluble glucosyltransferase, which only recognizes denatured domains on glycoproteins (4Parodi A.J. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 1-12Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 10Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20298-20304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The re-glucosylated glycoprotein can then rebind to calnexin, and folding can continue. Calnexin binds poorly to glycoproteins carrying three untrimmed glucose residues, as it preferentially recognizes monoglucosylated species (11Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, α-glucosidase inhibitors have minimal effects on cell viability and secretion (12Platt F.M. Karlsson G.B. Jacob G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and cell lines deficient in α-glucosidases have a relatively normal phenotype (13Stanley P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that alternative mechanisms exist within cells to enable the correct folding of many glycoproteins to occur, when they are prevented from interacting with their chaperones. The effects of α-glucosidase inhibition on cellular glycoproteins are selective (14Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For example, the transferrin receptor requires correct oligosaccharide processing for cell surface expression, whereas other cell surface glycoproteins in the same cell line are expressed normally (12Platt F.M. Karlsson G.B. Jacob G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The common observation in mammalian systems is that some glucosylated glycoproteins fold normally (presumably those that are calnexin-independent or utilize other chaperones during their folding), whereas others fail to fold completely and are retained in the ER prior to degradation (15Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2107-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As yet we have no insight into predicting the fate of a given glycoprotein when synthesized in a cell treated with inhibitors of α-glucosidase I. We also have little information concerning whether a glycoprotein can remain partially misfolded in one domain of the protein, as a result of retaining glucosylatedN-glycans, while other domains adopt a relatively normal conformation and are recognized by the appropriate effector molecules within the cell. The vast majority of studies to date have focused almost exclusively on the role of N-glycans on"

Native rat and human ARs interfered with pCMV-ARE2-CAT expression in a hormone-dependent fashion. Low steroid-independent interference seemed to occur because of the ligand binding domain (LBD), which was transcriptionally inhibitory also in a heterologous context. AR devoid of LBD (rARΔ641–902) decreased pCMV-ARE2-CAT activity by 50%. The rARΔ46–408 mutant devoid of the NH2-terminal transcription activation region exhibited ligand-dependent promoter interference of a similar magnitude. Ligand and DNA binding-deficient mutants (hARM807R and rARC562G, respectively) did not influence pCMV-ARE2-CAT expression, although hARM807R binds to ARE in vitro. Non-steroidal anti-androgens casodex and hydroxyflutamide antagonized agonist-dependent promoter interference, whereas cyproterone acetate, RU 56187, RU 57073, and RU 59063 were partial agonists/antagonists.

With regard to the ligand requirement for the recognition of specific DNA elements by AR, in vitroelectrophoretic mobility shift assays have yielded conflicting results. AR protein expressed in reticulocyte lysate or produced insect cells is capable of binding to specific androgen response elements (AREs)in vitro even in the absence of androgen (8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11514-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the ligand requirement for the binding of hAR to AREs in vitro has also been reported (10Wong C. Zhou Z. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19004-19012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very limited information is available on ARE occupancy by the receptor protein in intact cells.In vivo footprinting of an androgen-dependent enhancer of the mouse slp gene failed to reveal clear protection of hormone response elements by AR (11Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar). While this work was in progress, Kuil and Mulder (12Kuil C.W. Mulder E. Endocrinology. 1996; 17: 1870-1877Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that AR interaction with an “idealized” consensus ARE derived from polymerase chain reaction selection experiments is ligand-dependent in cultured cells. The promoter interference assay developed by Hu and Davidson (13Hu M.C.-T. Davidson M. Cell. 1987; 48: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) is based on competition of DNA-binding proteins, such as nuclear receptors, for binding with essential transcription factors driving a constitutively active heterologous promoter. The interference is achieved by inserting an attachment sequence between the TATA box and the start site of transcription in the promoter. A promoter interference assay has been employed in a few reports to examine the interaction of estrogen receptor (ER) with its cognate response elements in mammalian and frog cells (14Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Xing H. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that of AR with AREs in Chinese hamster ovary cells (12Kuil C.W. Mulder E. Endocrinology. 1996; 17: 1870-1877Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because of the use of transiently transfected cells, the physiological chromatin environment is not achieved under these conditions. However, using a pCMV-PRE2-CAT construct stably integrated into T47D breast cancer cells, Gass et al. (16Gass, L., Leonhardt, S., Altmann, M., and Edwards, P. (1996)Abstracts of the 10th International Congress of Endocrinology, San Francisco, June 12–15, abstract p2-682.Google Scholar) recently reported that progesterone receptor (PR) is able to interfere with expression of this reporter also in the context of stable chromatin conformation, albeit less well than in transiently transfected cells. In our previous studies, we constructed several NH2-terminal deletion mutants of AR to define domains crucial for the activation functions of this protein (5Kallio P.J. Poukka H. Moilanen A. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol.

One of the mutants, rARΔ46–408, devoid of a region mandatory for transcriptional activation (8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar), bound to ARE in vitro with somewhat lower affinity than the wild-type AR (9Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11514-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but behaved as a dominant negative regulator of the native protein, possibly through forming transcriptionally inactive heterodimers with the latter (8Palvimo J.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11514-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of rARΔ46–408, or comparable mutants of the glucocorticoid receptor subfamily of nuclear receptors, to interact with specific DNA sequences in intact cells has, however, not been addressed previously. The COOH-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) provides the means to regulate the function of native AR in a steroid-dependent fashion. Removal of this region generates a constitutively active receptor form (17Rundlett S.E. Wu X.-P. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Jenster G. van der Korput H.A.G.M. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol.

Jänne, submitted for publication. However, in vivo DNA binding characteristics of LBD-deficient AR forms or those of other members of the glucocorticoid receptor subfamily have not been examined. In the present work we have used promoter interference assays to investigate whether binding of AR to specific DNA sequences is ligand-dependent in intact CV-1 cells. We have also examined which functional domains of the wild-type receptor, in addition to the DNA binding domain (DBD), are mandatory for specific DNA binding in vivo. To assess the role of the ligand, several non-steroidal and steroidal anti-androgens alone or together with an androgen agonist were used. Finally, immunocytochemical analysis of cultured cells was employed to rule out the possibility that some of the results were compromised by altered subcellular distribution of receptor proteins.

Teutsch (Roussel UCLAF, Romainville, France). pCMV-ARE2-CAT reporter was constructed from pCMV-0-CAT (a gift from Dr. B. Katzenellenbogen, University of Illinois, Urbana) by inserting a double-stranded 45-base pair oligonucleotide, 5′-CATAGTACGTGATGTTCTAGGCCTAGTACGTGATGTTCTCGAGCT-3′, containing duplicated high affinity AREs (half-sites underlined) of the C3(1) gene of prostatic binding protein (9Kallio P.J.

Lehming (Max-Delbrück Laboratory, Max-Plack Institute, Cologne, Germany). GAL4-LBD and GAL-Nterm contained amino acids 641–902 and 5–538 of rAR, respectively, fused in-frame to Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4-DBD.2 CV-1 and COS-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml) and streptomycin (25 units/ml) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-six h before transfection, 1.5 × 106 cells were seeded on 10-cm plates. The medium was replaced 2–4 h before transfection with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. The calcium phosphate coprecipitation method was used for transfections as described previously (8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol.

The total amount of DNA was 10 μg/10-cm plate and included the following components: 0.5–2.5 μg of receptor expression vector DNA (pSGrAR, pSGhAR, pSGrARC562G, pSGhARM807R, pSGrARΔ46–408, pSGrARΔ46–408/C562G, and pSGrARΔ641–902), 2 μg of pCMV-ARE2-CAT reporter (or pCMV-ERE2-CAT when indicated), 3 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH110, Pharmacia) as an internal control, and empty pSG5 DNA as needed. Ten μg of pGEM-3Z DNA was used in mock transfections. In transfections with pG5SV40CAT or pSV40CAT reporter (1 μg/10-cm plate), 5 μg of GAL4-DBD-LBD, GAL4-DBD-Nterm, or GAL4-DBD expression vector was used, and the amount of total DNA was adjusted to 10 μg with pBluescript II SK DNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Eighteen h after transfection, the cells were switched into fresh medium containing androgens and anti-androgens at concentrations specified in the legends to the figures and Table I.

Replacement of medium and exposure to steroids were conducted as in the promoter interference assay. Cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 10 min and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.3) at 22 °C for 10 min. The primary antibody K183 (diluted 1:200) is a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against full-length rAR purified to homogeneity using preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions from Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding rAR (25Xie Y.-B.

Two × 107cells were lysed in 2 ml of electrophoresis sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), passed five times through a 25-gauge needle, and soluble proteins were separated using Bio-Rad model 491 Prep Cell apparatus with a 37-mm (inner diameter) tube. Electrophoresis was carried out at 50 mA, proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (pH 8.0) at 0.45 ml/min, and 4.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing rAR were pooled and concentrated using Amicon P-10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Rabbits were injected with 50 μg of rAR protein at each immunization. Diluted K183 antiserum (1:200) was incubated on cells for 1 h at 22 °C, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Philadelphia) was used (1:200 dilution, 30 min at 22 °C) to detect the antigen. Conditions for immunoblotting were as described previously (8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar), except that antiserum K183 (diluted 1:1,500) was used as the primary antibody. An AR-dependent promoter interference reporter plasmid, pCMV-ARE2-CAT, was constructed in a fashion similar to that described for ER (14Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) by inserting a duplicated high affinity ARE sequence between the TATA box and transcription start site of pCMV-0-CAT (Fig. 1 A). Two AREs were inserted, as the presence of more than one palindromic response element facilitates AR-ARE interactions in vitro (9Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11514-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pCMV-0-CAT devoid of ARE sequences was initially used as the control reporter, but its basal activity in CV-1 cells was several times higher than that of pCMV-ARE2-CAT. This result was in agreement with a previous report (13Hu M.C.-T. Davidson M. Cell. 1987; 48: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) that insertion of sequences into a similar location (between the TATA box and the start site of transcription) decreases CAT expression. For this reason, we used pCMV-ERE2-CAT reporter (Fig. 1 A) as control to assess the specificity of AR-ARE interaction in intact cells. CV-1 cells were cotransfected with various AR expression plasmids (Fig. 1 B) and pCMV-ARE2-CAT (or pCMV-ERE2-CAT) reporter driven by the constitutively active CMV promoter. Native rAR and hAR interfered with pCMV-ARE2-CAT expression in such a way that both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent inhibition of the reporter activity was seen (Fig. 2, A andB). rAR showed somewhat higher ligand-independent promoter-interfering activity than hAR. Since expression levels of rAR and hAR proteins were not compared in these experiments, the reason for this species difference remains to be elucidated. Both ARs also elicited some inhibition of pCMV-ERE2-CAT expression which was, however, not increased by androgen (Fig. 2, C andD). Even though the weak ligand-independent activity of AR was not specific for the hormone response element inserted in the promoter interference construct, it was specific for the promoter interference assay itself, as a similar androgen-independent activity was not observed in transactivation experiments. It is also worth pointing out that maximal promoter interference and transcriptional activation were achieved with comparable amounts of rAR or hAR expression plasmid (1 μg DNA/plate). 3U. Karvonen, O. A. Jänne, and J. J. Palvimo, unpublished observations. However, ligand-occupied hAR was twice as active as rAR in these latter experiments (110-fold versus 50-fold increase over control, respectively3), which is in contrast to the behavior of apo-hAR and apo-rAR in promoter interference assays (see Fig. 2,A and B). AR forms incapable of DNA or hormone binding (rARC562G and hARM807R, respectively) were used to assess the importance of these regions for specific AR-ARE interaction in vivo. rARC562G with a Cys → Gly substitution at codon 562 does not bind to DNA in vitroand is transcriptionally inactive (22Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Reinikainen P. Jänne O.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). hARM807R is incapable of hormone binding because of a Met → Arg substitution at codon 807 (21Adeyemo O. Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Kontula K. Jänne O.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays under cell-free conditions, hARM807R bound to ARE with approximately the same affinity as the wild-type receptor in the absence of androgen (21Adeyemo O. Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Kontula K. Jänne O.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but exposure to androgen did not elicit a conformational change in the LBD of hARM807R in a fashion similar to that in the wild-type LBD (21Adeyemo O. Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Kontula K. Jänne O.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,27Kallio P.J. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). rARC562G and hARM807R mutants did not interfere with pCMV-ARE2-CAT activity in a steroid-dependent fashion, but they exhibited weak hormone-independent interference, essentially indistinguishable from that of the wild-type apo-AR (Fig.3, A and B). The fact that rARC562G behaved like apo-AR both in the presence and absence of testosterone implies that specific binding of the wild-type AR to DNA in intact cells is totally dependent on the integrity of the first zinc finger and that the conformational change elicited by an active androgen in the LBD does not abolish the ability of this region to interfere weakly with pCMV-ARE2-CAT expression. Previous studies have shown that AR forms devoid of the entire LBD behave as constitutively active transactivators and are capable of binding to specific DNA elements in vitro (17Rundlett S.E. Wu X.-P. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Jenster G. van der Korput H.A.G.M. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).2 The rARΔ641–902 mutant that lacks the LBD reduced expression of pCMV-ARE2-CAT by 50% but did not influence that of pCMV-ERE2-CAT (Fig. 4 A). It is of note that maximal promoter interference was achieved with the lowest amount of pSGrARΔ641–902 expression vector used (0.5 μg of DNA/10-cm plate), and no additional increase in the interference occurred when the amount of plasmid was augmented 5-fold (Fig.4 A) or 10-fold (data not shown). Interaction of rARΔ641–902 with DNA was, as expected, independent of the presence of ligand, whether an agonist (Fig. 4 A) or an antagonist (54 ± 5% of control in cells transfected with 0.5 μg of pSGrARΔ641–902 in the presence of 1 μm casodex). To examine the role of the NH2-terminal region, rARΔ46–408 and rARΔ46–408/C562G mutants were used. rARΔ46–408 expressed in insect cells binds to specific DNA sequences in vitro, albeit with a somewhat lower affinity than the wild-type AR (8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11514-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in CV-1 cells, rARΔ46–408 elicited promoter interference in an androgen-dependent fashion (Fig.4 B). This interference required the presence of ARE sequences, as a similar steroid-dependent inhibition of pCMV-ERE2-CAT expression failed to occur under the same conditions (Fig. 4 B). Likewise, an intact DBD of the receptor was required, as judged by the inability of rARΔ46–408/C562G to interfere with pCMV-ARE2-CAT activity.2 Some hormone-independent inhibition of pCMV-ARE2-CAT activity was observed with rARΔ46–408 when higher amounts of expression plasmid were used in transfections (Fig.4 B). Taken together, interaction of AR with specific DNA sequences in intact cells can take place in the absence of LBD or most of the NH2-terminal region. DNA binding of the receptor, even in the presence of LBD and steroid, is not sufficient to elicit proper physiological responses, as the rARΔ46–408 mutant is transcriptionally inactive (8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the dose-response curves between rARΔ641–902 and rARΔ46–408 suggests that LBD is responsible for the weak hormone-independent interference of AR with pCMV-ARE2-CAT or pCMV-ERE2-CAT expression (Fig.4, A and B). The results with full-length AR forms (Fig. 2) were in general agreement with those obtained with rARΔ641–902 and rARΔ46–408 mutants. The ability of LBD to interfere with transcription was examined by additional experiments, in which pG5SV40CAT reporter containing five GAL4 binding sites upstream of the SV40 promoter was used. CV-1 cells were cotransfected using this reporter or an appropriate control reporter (pSV40CAT) and expression vectors encoding GAL4-DBD, GAL4-LBD, or GAL4-Nterm fusion proteins. The NH2-terminal region of AR (residues 5–538) fused to GAL4-DBD did not influence the activity of the latter; however, when the fusion partner was LBD (residues 641–902), repression of transcriptional activity took place (Fig.5 A). It is of note that the ability of ligand-free LBD to repress transcription at a distance exceeded that of the ligand-occupied LBD in the GAL4-DNA-binding construct (Fig.5 A). The repressive action of LBD-containing fusion protein was dependent on its tethering to DNA, as no inhibition was detected in the absence of GAL4-binding elements (Fig. 5 B). Several anti-androgens (casodex, hydroxyflutamide, RU 56187, RU 57073, RU 59063, and cyproterone acetate) were examined by promoter interference assays using rARΔ46–408, as differentiation between ligand-dependent and -independent activities was more clear-cut with this mutant than with native ARs. All other anti-androgens examined but hydroxyflutamide were able to confer some promoter-interfering activity upon rARΔ46–408, with cyproterone acetate and the RU compounds being as potent as an agonist (10 nm testosterone) at the concentration used (1 μm) (Table I). Additional studies with casodex revealed that its low agonist-like activity in the promoter interference assay was also detectable with wild-type rAR and at varying receptor levels (Fig. 6 A). When present concomitantly with androgen, casodex inhibited the agonist-induced promoter interference significantly but not completely (Fig. 6 B). Previous studies have shown that casodex and hydroxyflutamide are completely devoid of inherent transactivation ability (22Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Reinikainen P. Jänne O.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), whereas cyproterone acetate is a partial agonist/antagonist (29Kemppainen J.A. Lane M.V. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 968-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three N-substituted arylthiohydantoin anti-androgens (RU 56187, RU 7073, and RU 59063) were as effective as testosterone in conferring promoter-interfering activity on rARΔ46–408 (TableI). This is in agreement with binding affinities of these compounds for rat and human ARs in vitro, which are 92–300% of that of testosterone (30Teutsch G. Goubet F. Battmann T. Bonfils A. Bouchoux F. Cerede E. Gofflo D. Gaillard-Kelly M. Philibert D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When CV-1 cells cotransfected with pSGrAR and pMMTV-CAT vectors were exposed to 1 μm of each RU anti-androgen alone, CAT activity was 50% with RU 56187, 28% with RU 57073, and 35% with RU 59063 of that with 10 nmtestosterone. Concomitant exposure of the cells to 10 nmtestosterone and 1 μm RU anti-androgens resulted in reporter gene activities that were 39–66% of those achieved with androgen alone, indicating that the three RU compounds were partial agonists/antagonists under these conditions. As the RU compounds promoted AR-ARE interaction in CV-1 cells as well as testosterone (Table I), conformational requirements on LBD for transcriptional activation and recognition of specific DNA sequences (promoter interference) are not identical in intact cells. The polyclonal antiserum (K183) used in these experiments was specific for AR proteins, as no extra bands were observed in mock-transfected cells, and only the receptor protein was detected in immunoblots of COS-1 cells transfected with some of the AR expression constructs used in promoter interference assays (Fig.7). The antiserum recognized rARΔ46–408 and rARΔ641–902 mutants as efficiently as the native receptor protein and, therefore, was useful for immunological studies of different AR forms in cultured cells. CV-1 cells transfected with 1 μg of pSGrAR DNA showed some immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm in the absence of androgen, whereas unliganded hAR was more clearly nuclear in its localization under the same conditions (Fig. 8, A and C). Both receptors became solely nuclear upon hormone exposure (Fig. 8,B and D). rARC562G and hARM807R exhibited both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in the absence of testosterone (Fig. 8, E and F). The AR form devoid of most of the NH2-terminal region (rARΔ46–408) showed mainly nuclear localization even in the absence of androgen (Fig.8 G), and it was strictly nuclear after exposure to testosterone (data not shown). Likewise, the LBD-deficient mutant (rARΔ641–902) was nuclear in the absence of the hormone (Fig.8 H). CV-1 cells transfected with pSGhAR expression vector and exposed to casodex or hydroxyflutamide exhibited only nuclear localization of the receptor protein (Fig. 8, I andJ). Taken together, immunocytochemical studies of transfected CV-1 cells expressing wild-type and mutant AR proteins revealed that the receptor forms were mainly nuclear even in the absence of ligand, indicating that differences in subcellular localization do not explain their dissimilar behavior in the promoter interference assay. The results of this work show that sequence-specific DNA binding of the native AR in cultured CV-1 cells requires the presence of ligand. In this respect, our data agree with a recent report by Kuil and Mulder (12Kuil C.W. Mulder E. Endocrinology. 1996; 17: 1870-1877Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), who also used the promoter interference assay to examine the interaction of AR with a synthetic consensus ARE in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Our data show further that neither LBD nor a major part of the NH2-terminal transactivation region of the receptor is needed for its interaction with specific DNA sequencesin vivo. LBD is not only dispensable but also appears to be responsible for the ability of apo-AR to interfere weakly with pCMV-ARE2-CAT expression. In addition, unoccupied LBD fused to GAL4-DBD was capable of repressing transcriptional activity of a heterologous SV40 promoter at a distance. Should AR bind to AREs as a homodimer in intact cells, as it does in vitro (8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11514-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the results with rARΔ641–902 illustrate that this dimerization utilizes sequences other than those residing in LBD. Moreover, the interaction between COOH- and NH2-terminal regions of AR, which has been shown to occur in mammalian cells (31Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar),2 is not mandatory for the ability of the receptor to recognize specific DNA elements in vivo, as shown by appropriate deletion mutants in promoter interference assay. Studies with rARΔ46–408 that lacks most of the NH2-terminal region and with anti-androgens also provided compelling evidence that mere DNA binding in vivo is not sufficient for the AR to become a competent transcriptional activator. The hARM807R mutant is incapable of hormone binding, totally inactive in transactivation assays, and the reason for complete androgen insensitivity of a patient (21Adeyemo O. Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Kontula K. Jänne O.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It could be speculated that inappropriate folding of this mutant's LBD may render it free of intracellular chaperones such as heat shock proteins (32Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Zegers N.D. van der Kwast T.H. Grootegoed J.A. Mulder E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7422-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), thereby permitting its binding to AREs even in vivo. However, our present data and those of Kuil and Mulder (12Kuil C.W. Mulder E. Endocrinology. 1996; 17: 1870-1877Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrate that specific DNA binding in living cells is not achieved without a ligand-induced allosteric change in the LBD. The findings that hARM807R binds well to AREs in vitro (21Adeyemo O. Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Kontula K. Jänne O.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and is localized in nuclei of transfected cells (this study) are interpreted to mean that the steroid-induced change in LBD conformation is primarily required for the release of AR from associated inhibitory protein complexes, rather than for generation of a receptor form capable of ARE recognition. The mutant rARΔ46–408, which has a region mandatory for transcriptional activation deleted (8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar), recognized specific DNA sequences in CV-1 cells in a fashion indistinguishable from that of the wild-type receptor, implying that the NH2 terminus is not essential for this interaction. This result is in agreement with our previous studies on AR-ARE interaction in vitro, in that NH2-terminal internal deletions compromised the affinity of rAR for AREs only to a moderate extent; the K D of interaction increased from 0.5–1.0 nm to 3.0 nm (8Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11514-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AR protein produced in insect cells has been suggested to require intracellular hormone exposure to overcome the inhibition imposed by the NH2-terminal domain on dimerization and DNA binding of the aporeceptor (10Wong C. Zhou Z. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19004-19012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present experiments showed, however, that unliganded rARΔ46–408 was incapable of sequence-specific DNA binding in CV-1 cells (Fig.4 B), implying that a major part of the NH2-terminal region is not critical for maintaining the receptor in a non-DNA-binding form. Anti-androgens that were examined in this work can be divided into two groups on basis of their ability to modulate the binding of AR to AREs. The first group is not capable of converting the receptor to a form that binds to specific DNA sequences in CV-1 cells, or it does this poorly. When present concomitantly with an agonist, these compounds inhibit the agonist-dependent promoter interference. Non-steroidal anti-androgens casodex and hydroxyflutamide belong to this group. The second group includes the steroidal anti-androgen cyproterone acetate and three N-substituted arylthiohydantoin anti-androgens (RU 56187, RU 57073 and RU 59063). These compounds, at least at the concentrations used, converted AR to a form capable of ARE binding in CV-1 cells. Moreover, the compounds of the second group behaved as partial agonists/antagonists in transactivation experiments. Kuil and Mulder (12Kuil C.W. Mulder E. Endocrinology. 1996; 17: 1870-1877Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have also reported that in Chinese hamster ovary cells, casodex and hydroxyflutamide inhibited DNA binding of AR, but cyproterone acetate failed to do so. Ligand-free human and rat ARs exhibited weak promoter-interfering activity. In this respect, our results on AR differed form those reported by Reese and Katzenellenbogen (14Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and Xing and Shapiro (15Xing H. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on human and frog ERs, respectively. In these latter cases, unoccupied wild-type ER showed moderate to high interfering activity, and some ligand-free ER mutants were even more potent than the estrogen-bound wild-type ER (14Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Xing H. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, apo-PR elicited strong interference with pCMV-PRE-CAT expression, which was almost 50% of that of the progestin-bound PR (16Gass, L., Leonhardt, S., Altmann, M., and Edwards, P. (1996)Abstracts of the 10th International Congress of Endocrinology, San Francisco, June 12–15, abstract p2-682.Google Scholar). The observed differences in the behavior of nuclear receptors in promoter interference assays could result, at least in part, from dissimilar affinities of their LBDs for auxiliary proteins communicating with transcription machinery. A COOH-terminal region of PR has recently been reported to contain a transcriptional repressor domain that functions through a putative corepressor (33Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12195-12199Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); however, a similar function has not so far been described for the COOH terminus of AR. The use of a heterologous GAL4 system supported the notion that LBD is responsible for the weak ligand-independent promoter-interfering activity of AR. The activity of this LBD in the context of GAL4 fusion protein was not dependent on the ligand-induced conformational change; rather, ligand-free GAL4-LBD bound to elements upstream of SV40 promoter exhibited stronger repressive action than the ligand-occupied form, suggesting that apo-LBD is the favored conformation in recruitment of putative repressor proteins. In conclusion, the results of this work indicate that interaction of AR with specific DNA sequences in CV-1 cells does not involve COOH-terminal or NH2-terminal regions of the receptor, even though the NH2-terminal domain contains sequences required for transcriptional activation. In the context of wild-type AR, the androgen-induced conformational change in the COOH terminus is, however, mandatory for generation of a transcriptionally competent receptor protein that binds to ARE sequences in intact cells, even though mere DNA binding in vivo is not sufficient for the AR to acquire competence in transcriptional activation. And finally, LBD appears to be responsible for the weak promoter-interfering activity of apo-AR. We thank Dr. Ismo Virtanen for help in immunocytochemistry and Drs. Benita Katzenellenbogen and Norbert Lehming for plasmids."

Treatment of cells withcis-4-methylsphingosine at micromolar levels resulted in a markedly decreased sphingolipid biosynthesis, whereas the other compounds examined, trans-4-methylsphingosine,cis-5-methylsphingosine,trans-5-methylsphingosine, cis-sphingosine, and 1-deoxysphingosine, inhibited sphingolipid biosynthesis less efficiently. The inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis by the various compounds was paralleled by a decrease of serine palmitoyltransferase activity in situ. For cis-4-methylsphingosine the inhibitory effect on serine palmitoyltransferase activity was shown to be concentration- and time-dependent. Half-maximal reduction of enzyme activity occurred after 24 h of treatment with 10 μm of the compound. The activity of other enzymes of sphingolipid biosynthesis as well as phospholipid and protein biosynthesis was not affected.Analysis of the sphingoid moiety of cellular sphingolipids suggests that the sphingosine analogues listed above were subject to degradation rather than being utilized as precursors for sphingolipid biosynthesis by cultured neurons. Except of 1-deoxysphingosine, the other five sphingosine analogues were shown to be substrates for sphingosine kinase in vitro. After 24 h of treatment of primary cerebellar neurons with the various sphingosine analogues the relative percentage of the respective intracellular 1-phosphate derivatives paralleled exactly the inhibitory effect on serine palmitoyltransferase activity observed when cells were treated with the unphosphorylated compounds. In contrast to the respective 1-phosphate derivatives of the other methyl-branched sphingosine analogues examined,cis-4-methylsphingosine 1-phosphate showed an intracellular accumulation suggesting a delayed turnover rate in cultured murine neurons for this compound. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of the sphingosine analogues on serine palmitoyltransferase is mediated by their respective 1-phosphate derivatives and that the pronounced effect of cis-4-methylsphingosine is caused by a high intracellular concentration ofcis-4-methylsphingosine 1-phosphate.cis-4-Methylsphingosine, in addition, caused drastic changes in cell morphology of primary cerebellar neurons, which were not observed when these cells were treated with one of the other sphingosine analogues examined.

Sphingolipids (glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin) are primarily plasma membrane molecules of eukaryotic cells. Glycosphingolipids consist of a hydrophobic part, ceramide, which is anchored in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer, and a hydrophilic part composed of carbohydrate chains extruding into the extracellular space. They are thought to be involved in a variety of biological processes, such as cell differentiation and morphogenesis (1Hakomori S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); binding of epitopes of viruses, bacteria, and toxins (2Karlsson K.-A. Annu. Rev.

In addition, evidence emerged during the past years that sphingolipid (SL) 1The abbreviations used are: SL, sphingolipid; CHAPS, (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; SPP, sphingosine 1-phosphate; UDP-glucose, uridine 5′-diphosphoglucose; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; the term sphinganine is used for dihydrosphingosine throughout the manuscript. 1The abbreviations used are: SL, sphingolipid; CHAPS, (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; SPP, sphingosine 1-phosphate; UDP-glucose, uridine 5′-diphosphoglucose; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; the term sphinganine is used for dihydrosphingosine throughout the manuscript. metabolites such as sphingosine (4Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), ceramide (5Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (6Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) play an important role as intracellular signaling molecules for a variety of different targets (for review, see Ref. 7Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Ceramide appears to be a mediator of both the inflammatory and the apoptotic response to tumor necrosis factor-α (7Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) while sphingosine, besides its action as a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (8Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merril Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as sphingosine 1-phosphate are thought to act as mitogenic second messengers (9Zhang H. Buckley N.E. Gibson K. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Olivera A. Zhang H. Carlson R.O. Mattie M.E. Schmidt R.R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the combined action of different sphingolipid signaling molecules seems to regulate, at least in part, the apoptotic and mitogenic cellular response. The identification of factors interfering with SL synthesis and the examination of their mode of action is of great importance for studying the regulation of SL. Much of the current knowledge on biosynthesis of SL and regulation of their metabolism has been derived from studies with compounds inhibiting certain steps of the SL synthesis pathway (11Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 565-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25032-25038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SL biosynthesis begins with the condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-dehydrosphinganine and proceeds to the synthesis of ceramide which is then stepwise glycosylated in the Golgi compartment to form more complex glycosphingolipids (for review, see Ref. 16van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5341-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step takes place in the cytosolic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum and is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (17Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies from others and from our laboratory suggest that serine palmitoyltransferase might be a possible point of regulation of SL biosynthesis. It was shown that sphingosines with different chain lengths as well as azidosphingosine decreased the de novo SL biosynthesis in murine cerebellar neurons (18van Echten G. Birk R. Brenner-Weiss G. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9333-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that treatment of cultured cerebellar cells with these compounds down-regulated serine palmitoyltransferase activity (19Mandon E.C. van Echten G. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate further the response of SL biosynthesis to various exogenous sphingoid bases we investigated in the present study the effect of four different methyl-branched sphingosine analogues as well as cis-sphingosine and 1-deoxysphingosine on SL biosynthesis in primary cultured neurons. We demonstrate that treatment of the cells with cis-4-methylsphingosine causes a strong inhibitory effect on serine palmitoyltransferase activity resulting in a decreasedde novo synthesis of sphingolipids. In addition, drastic changes in cell morphology were observed using this compound. All four methyl-branched sphingosine analogues were found to be substrates of sphingosine kinase, however, only the 1-phosphate derivative ofcis-4-methylsphingosine was shown to accumulate in the cell, suggesting that cis-4-methylsphingosine 1-phosphate is the active metabolite causing the physiological and morphological changes observed. Six-day-old NMRI (Navy Marine Research Institute) mice were obtained from Dr. Karzel of the Institute of Pharmacology of the University of Bonn, Germany.l-[3-14C]Serine (2.0 GBq/mmol), UDP-[14C]glucose (10.5 GBq/mmol),l-[U-14C]phenylalanine (16.6 GBq/mmol), [1-14C]linoleic acid (2.03 GBq/mmol), [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (2.0 TBq/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Corp. (Braunschweig, Germany). NaH2[32P]O4 (3.7–37 GBq/mmol) was obtained from ICN (Meckenheim, Germany). The methyl-branched sphingosines cis-4-methylsphingosine,cis-5-methylsphingosine,trans-4-methylsphingosine, andtrans-5-methylsphingosine as well as 1-deoxysphingosine were synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. R. R. Schmidt of the Faculty of Chemistry of the University of Konstanz, Germany, as described previously (20Bär, T., Kratzer, B., Wild, R., Sandhoff, K., and Schmidt, R. R. (1993) Liebigs Ann. Chem. 419–426.Google Scholar). cis-Sphingosine and sphingosine were synthesized according to Zimmermann and Schmidt (21Zimmermann, P., and Schmidt, R. R. (1988) Liebigs Ann. Chem.663–667.Google Scholar). The purity of all sphingoid bases examined was at least 98%. C18-sphingosine (62.4 TBq/mol) was tritium-labeled on carbon 3 (22Birk R. Brenner-Weiss G. Giannis A. Sandhoff K. Schmidt R.R. J. Lab. Compd. Radiopharm. 1991; 39: 289-298Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and C18-sphinganine (12.5 TBq/mol) was tritium-labeled by reduction of the 4.5-double bond according to Schwarzmann and Sandhoff (23Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Methods. Enzymol. 1987; 138: 318-341Google Scholar). C12C12-ceramide was obtained byN-acylation of C12-sphingosine, as described (24Brenner-Weiß G. Giannis A. Sandhoff K. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 5855-5860Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). C12-sphingosine was synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. R. R. Schmidt, University of Konstanz, according to methods previously published (21Zimmermann, P., and Schmidt, R. R. (1988) Liebigs Ann. Chem.663–667.Google Scholar). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, trypsin, deoxyribonuclease, bovine serum albumin, and horse serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Karlsruhe, Germany). Thin layer Silica Gel 60 plates and LiChroprep RP18 were supplied by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Sephadex G-25 superfine was purchased from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany). The scintillation mixture Pico Fluor 40 was supplied by Packard (Frankfurt, Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma (München, Germany) or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Granule cells were cultured from cerebella of 6-day-old mice according to the method of Trenkner and Sidman (25Trenkner E. Sidman R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 915-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells were isolated by mild trypsinization (0.05%, w/v) and dissociated by repeated passage through a constricted Pasteur pipette in a DNase solution (0.1%, w/v). The cells were then suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm diameter Petri dishes (6 × 106 cells/dish). 24 h after plating cytosine arabinoside was added to the medium (4 × 10−5m) to arrest the division of non-neuronal cells (26Messer A. Brain Res. 1977; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined by measuring trypan blue exclusion or the release of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase activity using a commercially available test kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). After 4 days in culture, murine cerebellar neurons were incubated with sphingoid bases added as complexes with bovine serum albumin to the culture medium containing 0.3% heat-inactivated horse serum. Metabolic labeling of sphingolipids was performed as described previously (18van Echten G. Birk R. Brenner-Weiss G. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9333-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Newly synthesized sphingolipids were labeled by feeding cells with [14C]serine (2 μCi/ml), [3H]C18-sphingosine (2 μCi/ml), and [3H]C18-sphinganine (2 μCi/ml), respectively. After the appropriate labeling time as given under “Results” and in the legends of tables and figures, the cells were harvested and lipids were extracted from cell pellets by incubating the cells with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (10:5:1, v/v) for 24 h at 50 °C. Phospholipids were degraded by mild alkaline hydrolysis with methanolic NaOH (100 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C. The lipid extracts were desalted by reversed-phase chromatography on LiChroprep RP18, applied to TLC plates, and chromatographed with chloroform, methanol, 0.22% CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v). Sphingolipids were visualized by fluorography and identified by theirR F values and enzymatic digestion (18van Echten G. Birk R. Brenner-Weiss G. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9333-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were determined by radioscanning and scraped off the TLC plates for additional measurement by liquid scintillation counting. Metabolic labeling of phospholipids was achieved by treatment of the cells with [14C]linoleic acid (1 μCi/ml) or [3H]palmitic acid (3.4 μCi/ml). The labeled fatty acids were added as complexes with bovine serum albumin. After extraction, the phospholipids were separated by TLC with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (65:25:2:3, v/v). Serine palmitoyltransferase was measured as described previously (19Mandon E.C. van Echten G. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using [14C]serine and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates. In a total volume of 100 μl the assay mixture contained 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 50 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 1.2 mm [14C]serine (1.6 μCi), 0.15 mm palmitoyl-CoA, and 120 μg of cell protein. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C the reaction was terminated by addition of chloroform/methanol (5:3, v/v). The lipids were extracted by phase separation and applied to a TLC plate using chloroform, methanol, 2 m NH3 (40:10:1, v/v) as solvent system. The condensation product 3-dehydrosphinganine was detected by scanning the radioactivity, and the specific band was scraped off the TLC plate and determined by liquid scintillation counting. Ceramide synthase was assayed usingd[-erythro-4,5-3H]sphinganine and stearoyl-CoA as substrates. The reaction mixture in a total volume of 80 μl contained 0.1 m Tris buffered with sodium acetate at pH 7.4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μmstearoyl-CoA, 50 μm of the labeled sphinganine (0.5 μCi), which was previously sonicated for 2 min at 0 °C in the buffer solution, and 120 μg of cell protein. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the lipids were extracted, separated by TLC (chloroform/methanol/water, 80:10:1, v/v), and the radiolabeled ceramide was determined by liquid scintillation counting as described above. Glucosylceramide synthase was assayed in a total volume of 50 μl, containing 500 μm truncated ceramide (C12C12-ceramide), 125 μg of CHAPS, 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.2), 5 mm Mn2+, 2.5 mm Mg2+, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NADPH, 50 μmUDP-[14C]glucose (80,000 cpm/nmol), and 120 μg of cell protein. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The reaction mixture was desalted using a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 column. The column was washed twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The combined effluents were evaporated and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Sphingosine kinase was prepared and determined essentially as described by Olivera et al. (27Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 1 mmmercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 15 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, respectively, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine. Cells were then lysed by freeze-thawing, centrifuged at 105,000 × gfor 90 min, and the supernatants (cytosol) were stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration of supernatants was about 1 mg/ml. For the in vitro sphingosine kinase assay 50 μg of cytosol were used. 50 μm of each of the sphingosine analogues was added as substrate, respectively, as a complex with bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixtures contained 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 5% glycerol, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 15 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm4-deoxypyridoxine in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was started by addition of 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (1–2 μCi, 20 mm) and MgCl2 (100 mm) and was allowed to continue for 30 min at 37 °C. Reaction termination was achieved by addition of 20 μl of 1 n HCl followed by 0.8 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1, v/v). After vigorous vortexing, 240 μl of 2 n KCl was added and phases separated by centrifugation. The labeled lipids in the organic phase were resolved by TLC on Silica Gel G-60 with 1-butanol, methanol, acetic acid, water (80:20:10:2, v/v) and visualized by autoradiography. 20 nmol of sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) was added to each sample and visualized by spraying with molybdenum blue as described (28Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The radioactive spots corresponding to authentic SPP were identified by their R F value. Primary cultured neurons were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Karlsruhe, Germany) and then incubated in the same basic medium supplemented with 40 μCi/ml32Pi for 24 h as described (28Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with 10 μm sphingosine, sphingosine 1-phosphate, or one of the sphingosine analogues, respectively, for different time intervals. The cells were then placed on ice, the medium was removed, and cells were harvested. Sphingosine phosphates were extracted as described by Yatomi et al. (29Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Ohta H. Welch R.J. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellet from each dish was suspended in 500 μl of 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 138 mmNaCl, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl, and 1 mg/ml glucose. After addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), samples were vigorously vortexed and sonicated for 30 min. Phases were separated by adding 2 ml of chloroform, 2 ml of 1 m KCl, and 100 μl of 7 n NH4OH. The alkaline upper phases containing 90% of sphingosine phosphates were transferred to new tubes, to which 3 ml of chloroform and 200 μl of concentrated HCl were added. Samples were vigorously vortexed and phases separated. The lower chloroform phases, formed under these new acidic conditions, were resolved by TLC in 1-butanol, methanol, acetic acid, water (80:20:10:20, v/v). Phosphorylated sphingosines were visualized by autoradiography and identified by their R F value. Newly synthesized total cellular proteins were estimated by measuring the incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine and [14C]serine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable cell material. The radioactivity incorporated was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Total protein was quantified as described by Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214062) Google Scholar). After treatment of cells with the respective sphingosine analogue, mass measurements of free sphingoid bases were conducted by HPLC as described previously (31Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) with C14-sphinganine as an internal standard. Briefly, lipids were extracted from cell homogenates and lyophilized cell culture media. Phospholipids were removed from the lipid extracts by hydrolysis in 50 mm NaOH (2 h, 37 °C). The free sphingoid bases were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde and determined by HPLC. cis-4-Methylsphingosine andtrans-4-methylsphingosine were eluted with 5 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.0)/methanol (1:9, v/v), whereascis-sphingosine, cis- andtrans-5-methylsphingosine, and 1-deoxysphingosine were eluted with 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), methanol (1.7:9, v/v). For mass determination of total sphingolipids the lipid extracts were subjected to acid hydrolysis according to Gaver and Sweeley (32Gaver R. Sweeley C.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 3643-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with 0.5 n argon-saturated methanolic HCl for 16 h at 50 °C. By this procedure sphingoid bases were released from glycosphingolipid, ceramides, and sphingomyelin, and then measured by HPLC as described above. The loss of compounds due to extraction or hydrolysis procedure was equilized by a defined amount of C12C12-ceramide which was added to each sample as an internal standard. Primary cultured murine cerebellar neurons were treated with 10 μm cis-4-methylsphingosine,cis-5-methylsphingosine, cis-sphingosine,trans-4-methylsphingosine, andtrans-5-methylsphingosine as well as 1-deoxysphingosine, respectively. The chemical structures of these compounds are given in Fig. 1. After 24 h of incubation, [14C]serine, a precursor of sphingolipid biosynthesis, was added to the culture medium and incorporation into newly synthesized sphingolipids was measured.Figure 1Structures of sphingosine analogues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the presence of 10 μm cis-4-methylsphingosine the incorporation of [14C]serine into cellular sphingolipids was reduced to 40% of untreated controls (Table I, Fig.2). In contrast, the structurally related compoundstrans-4-methylsphingosine,cis-5-methylsphingosine,trans-5-methylsphingosine, cis-sphingosine, and 1-deoxysphingosine showed much less of an effect, if any, on [14C]serine incorporation. It is noteworthy, thattrans-5-methylsphingosine treatment caused a band pattern comigrating with sphingomyelin which in this experiment was quite different compared with the other sphingosine analogues (lane 5 of Fig. 2). It is most unlikely that this difference in migration is due to an incorporation oftrans-5-methylsphingosine into sphingomyelin as demonstrated in Fig. 8. At present, we cannot provide a conclusive explanation for this migration difference.Table IThe effect of sphingosine analogues on [14 C]serine incorporation into cellular sphingolipids and on SPT activity of cultured cerebellar neuronsSphingosine analogue (10 μm)[14C]Serine incorporation into total sphingolipidsSPT activity% of control% of controlcis-4-Methylsphingosine41 ± 253 ± 6trans-4-Methylsphingosine69 ± 870 ± 5cis-5-Methylsphingosine99 ± 685 ± 9trans-5-Methylsphingosine87 ± 590 ± 5cis-Sphingosine75 ± 593 ± 51-Desoxysphingosine95 ± 799 ± 4Cells were incubated with medium containing 10 μm of the indicated sphingosine analogue for 24 h. Then medium was renewed and [14C]serine was added. After an additional 24 h, cells were harvested, sphingolipids were isolated and evaluated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Alternatively SPT activity in the cell homogenate was determined after a 24-h incubation with the respective sphingosine analogue as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are means from duplicates of four different experiments. 100% serine incorporated equals 100,000 ± 18,000 cpm/mg of protein, while 100% of SPT activity corresponds to 900 ± 120 pmol × h−1 × mg−1. Open table in a new tab Cells were incubated with medium containing 10 μm of the indicated sphingosine analogue for 24 h. Then medium was renewed and [14C]serine was added.

The decrease of [14C]serine incorporation into SL caused by cis-4-methylsphingosine was concentration-dependent, as shown in Fig. 3. The decrease of [14C]serine incorporation after 24 h preincubation was about 15% when cells were treated with 1 μm cis-4-methylsphingosine and more than 90% when cells were treated with 100 μm of the compound. Treatment with 5, 10, 20, and 50 μm showed a decrease of [14C]serine incorporation of about 25, 60, 80 and 90%, respectively, as compared with control cells. The time dependence of [14C]serine incorporation is depicted in Fig.4. Preincubation of the cells with 10 μm cis-4-methylsphingosine for 24 h caused a decrease in [14C]serine incorporation of about 60%, while the decrease of label incorporation was more than 90% after 48 h preincubation, compared with control cells. At concentrations above 30 μm for 24 h of preincubation or longer preincubation times (10 μm for 48 h)cis-4-methylsphingosine exhibited a cytotoxic effect onto murine neuronal cells based on trypan blue exclusion assay and morphology as assessed by light microscopy.Figure 4Time dependence of the effect ofcis-4-methylsphingosine on incorporation of [14C]serine into cellular sphingolipids.

https://openalex.org/W1994652208,"A 28-kDa protein (p28) has been purified from Triton X-100 extracts of human erythrocyte plasma membrane by calmodulin affinity chromatography. Based on internal peptide sequencing and its protein amino acid composition, this protein has been shown to be highly related, if not identical to, Ral-A, a Ras-related GTP-binding protein. This protein assignment is consistent with the findings that p28 binds [32P]GTP specifically and has low GTPase activity. In this study we describe the identification and characterization of a calmodulin-binding domain in Ral-A. The Ca2+-dependent interaction of p28 with calmodulin was first detected by a calmodulin affinity column. Gel overlay experiments of both p28 and recombinant Ral-A with biotinylated calmodulin provided strong evidence that Ral-A is a calmodulin-binding protein. A peptide of 18 residues (P18) with the sequence SKEKNGKKKRKSLAKRIR has been identified as a putative calmodulin-binding domain in Ral-A, because it comprises a basic/hydrophobic composition with the propensity to form an amphiphilic helix. P18 was synthesized, and its interaction with calmodulin by gel overlay was shown to be Ca2+-dependent. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrated that this interaction results in less α-helical content upon calmodulin complex formation. These results indicate that Ral-A is a calmodulin-binding protein, raising the possibility that it may be associated with Ca2+-dependent intracellular signaling pathways.

P18 was synthesized, and its interaction with calmodulin by gel overlay was shown to be Ca2+-dependent. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrated that this interaction results in less α-helical content upon calmodulin complex formation. These results indicate that Ral-A is a calmodulin-binding protein, raising the possibility that it may be associated with Ca2+-dependent intracellular signaling pathways. The Ras superfamily of low molecular mass (20–29 kDa) GTP-binding proteins is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular functions and in signal transduction (1Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 2Bokoch G.M. Der C.J.

Functioning as a molecular switch the protein transduces signals in the active GTP-bound form and is converted to an inactive form when the bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. Its intrinsic GTPase activity is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as GDP dissociation stimulator (GDS), 1The abbreviations used are: GDS, GDP dissociation stimulator; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PVDF, polyvinylidenedifluoride; GAP, GTPase activating protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: GDS, GDP dissociation stimulator; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PVDF, polyvinylidenedifluoride; GAP, GTPase activating protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. GDP dissociation inhibitor, and GTPase activating protein (GAP). Ral proteins represent a distinct family of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins. They share more than 50% amino acid sequence identity with Ras, their nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis activities being comparable with those of Ras. The Ral genes were originally isolated from a cDNA library of immortalized simian B-lymphocytes (4Cardin P. Tavitian A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The isolation of additional Ral cDNAs from human pheochromocytoma and HL-60 leukemia libraries has revealed the existence of two forms of the gene, ral-A and ral-B, which are about 85% identical but differ essentially in their C-terminal region (5Cardin P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acid Res. 1989; 17: 4380-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ral gene products are expressed in human platelet membrane (6Polakis P.G. Weber R.F. Nevins B. Didsbury J.R. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16383-16389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in most cell types, with particularly high levels in brain and testis (7Olofsson B. Chardin P. Touchot N. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wildey G.M. Viggeswarapu M. Rim S. Denker J.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ral proteins have a diverse subcellular localization, not only in plasma membrane, but also in cytoplasmic vesicles, including clathrin-coated vesicles and secretory vesicles (9Bielinske D.F. Pyun H.Y. Linko-Stentz K. Macara I.G. Fine R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Volknandt W. Pevsner J. Elferink L.A. Scheller R.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Like other members of the Ras superfamily, Ral proteins have their own set of highly specific regulatory factors. RalGAP has been identified and characterized from the cytosolic fraction of rat brain and mouse testis (11Emkey R. Freedman S. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9703-9706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as human platelet (12Bhullar R. Seneviratne H.D. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 181-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RalGDS was found to interact withras p21 and to function as a putative effector protein in Ras signaling pathways (13Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.-H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, several groups have reported that Ral proteins and RalGDS constitute a distinct downstream pathway from Ras that can induce cellular transformation in parallel with activation of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (16Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 17White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway from Ras to Ral through RalGDS is selectively regulated by Rap1 (19Ikeda M. Koyama S. Okazaki M. Dohi K. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 588-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the effector protein of Ral, RLIP (Ral interacting protein), has been shown to contain a GAP region related to RhoGAP domains and to have GAP activity acting upon CDC42 and Rac (21Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22473-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ral-A has been documented to be involved in the tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of phospholipase D, suggesting that the signaling pathway from Ras to Ral leads to the regulation of phospholipid metabolism (22Jiang H. Luo J.-Q. Urano T. Frankel P. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Ral proteins are biochemically well characterized GTPases. However, little is known about their physiological functions, because no biological activity associated with its overexpression in cells has been detected (11Emkey R. Freedman S. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9703-9706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that a monomeric GTP-binding protein with molecular mass of 28 kDa (p28) purified from human erythrocyte membranes is highly related, if not identical to, Ral-A, as determined by internal peptide sequencing and amino acid composition analysis. This has also been confirmed by the measurement of its GTP binding and hydrolysis. The data show for the first time that Ral-A is a calmodulin-binding protein. A putative calmodulin-binding domain in Ral-A was identified in its C-terminal region based on its basic/hydrophobic amino acid composition and propensity to form an amphiphilic helix. An 18-amino acid peptide (P18) with the sequence corresponding to this putative calmodulin-binding domain has been synthesized, and its interaction with calmodulin has been characterized. Very recently, Fischer et al. have reported the presence of a calmodulin-binding domain in the C-terminal region of Gem/Kir, a subfamily of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins (23Fischer R. Wei Y. Anagli J. Berchtold T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25067-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rin, a neuron-specific, Ras-related GTP-binding protein, has been also shown to bind calmodulin through a C-terminal binding motif (24Lee C-H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study identifying a calmodulin-binding domain in Ral-A supports these two findings and in addition shows the calmodulin binding domain to be present in a Ras-related protein containing the CAAX motif, lacking in the previously identified examples. Work is currently in progress to investigate the function of this calmodulin-binding domain in Ral-A. Preliminary reports of this work have appeared previously in a conference proceeding (25Wang K.L. Roufogalis B.D. Proceedings of the 40th Australian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Canberra, Australia, Sept. 22–25, 1996. Australian Biochemical Society, Inc., Canberra, Australia1996: 324Google Scholar). Packed red blood cells were obtained from the Red Cross blood bank, Sydney (NSW, Australia). [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [14C]formaldehyde (40–60 mCi/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Calmodulin-agarose, ATP, GTP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate, avidin-alkaline phosphatase, nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.05% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and the reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Sigma. Calmodulin and biotinylated calmodulin were obtained from Calbiochem. PVDF membranes were from Bio-Rad. An 18-amino acid peptide (P18) with the sequence of SKEKNGKKKRKSLAKRIR was synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes Pty. Ltd. (VIC, Australia). Other materials and chemicals were the highest grade available from commercial sources. Recombinant Ral-A was a generous gift from Drs. Hiroshi Koide and Yoshito Kaziro at the Faculty of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. p28 protein was purified from human red blood cell membrane as described previously (26Khan M.T. Wang K.K.W. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10016-10021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Briefly, calmodulin-depleted human plasma membranes were prepared according to the method of Wang et al. (27Wang K.K.W. Roufogalis B.D. Villalobo A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The membranes (0.5–1.0 g of protein) were solubilized for 60 min at 4 °C in 200 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 200 μm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.55% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. After centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant collected from the solubilisate was applied to a calmodulin-agarose column (10 × 1.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the solubilization buffer. The column was washed rapidly with 500 ml (about 50 column volumes) of washing buffer (200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 200 μmCaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) until no protein was detected in the wash. The protein was eluted from the column by a gradient of increasing concentrations of EDTA from 2 to 5 mm in the elution buffer (200 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The fractions were collected and stored at −80 °C. For further purification, the fractions containing p28 were pooled, dialyzed against three changes of 2 liters of elution buffer without KCl and EDTA to reduce the salt concentration, and then loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (5 × 1.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with equilibration buffer (10 mmKCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (v/v) glycerol). The column was washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer. The protein was eluted with a buffer of 1 m KCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. The fractions were collected and analyzed by 6–14% SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide 6–14% slab gel electrophoresis under alkaline conditions (pH 8.8) as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar). Protein enzyme digestion, peptide sequencing, and protein identification were carried out by Drs. K. Mitchelhill and B. E. Kemp at the Jack Holt Protein Structure Laboratory, St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research (VIC, Australia). Briefly, p28 protein bands were excised from the gels and digested in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% CH3CN containing 2 μg of modified sequencing grade trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim). The tryptic peptides were separated by chromatography in a linear gradient from 0.01 to 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% CH3CN using a Hewlett Packard 1090 HPLC and sequenced on a Hewlett Packard G1000 protein sequencer using version 3.0 ethyl acetate chemistry. Protein samples were subjected to 6–14% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane in transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 10% methanol) at a constant current of 250 mA for 3 h. Amino acid composition analysis was performed by Jun X. Yan at the Macquarie University Center for Analytical Biotechnology (NSW, Australia). The PVDF membrane-bound proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl in a Pierce digestion tube at 110 °C for 22 h. Amino acids were recovered using a single step extraction in 60% (v/v) CH3CN and 0.02% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) derivatization was performed prior to chromatography, and the derivatization mix was injected onto a reversed phase Hypersil C18 column. The relative abundance of each amino acid (Asx, Glx, Ser, His, Gly, Thr, Ala, Pro, Tyr, Arg, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Phe, and Lys) was determined by measuring its concentration compared with an internal standard (125 pmol/amino acid; calibration kit, Sigma). However, during the hydrolysis process, tryptophan was destroyed by hydrochloric acid, and cysteine and lysine were oxidized. These three amino acids could not therefore be detected. Moreover, aspartic acid and asparagine as well as glutamic acid and glutamine were eluted as one peak instead of separate peaks. Thus, asparagine and glutamine were converted to their corresponding acids during hydrolysis so that Asp and Asn (Asx) and Glu and Gln (Glx) were counted together. Glycine values are inaccurate due to contamination from the gel running buffer after protein samples are analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF membrane. A special search program (Constellation 4) in SWISS two-dimensional PAGE amino acid composition analysis (available through the ExPasy server at the University of Geneva, accessed via World Wide Web) has therefore been developed that omits glycine and uses the remaining 15 amino acids for comparison of composition values. The score in this program is calculated by computing the euclidian distance between the search protein amino acid composition and the amino acid composition of all proteins in the SWISS-PROT data base. p28 GTP-binding activities were detected by two assays: (i) Photoaffinity labeling of p28 with [α-32P]GTP was carried out using the method of Nakaokaet al. (29Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The pure protein (about 1 μg) was incubated with 5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 μCi/mmol) in buffer containing 200 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μm 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate, 5 mmMgCl2, placed in an ice bath, and irradiated with a UV lamp (Mineralight model UVGL-58, 254 nm) at a distance of 8 cm for 30 min. When the specific binding of [α-32P]GTP to p28 was studied, the sample was preincubated with competing substrate GTP (100 μm) at room temperature for 10 min. After irradiation, the samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to 6–14% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane. The PVDF membranes were air dried and exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen for 72 h. The [α-32P]GTP-binding proteins were detected by autoradiography with a Phosphor Imager (Molecular Dynamics). (ii) [α-32P]GTP binding was followed after electroblotting onto PVDF membranes. For the detection of [α-32P]GTP-binding proteins on PVDF membranes, the modified procedure of Bhullar and Haslam (30Bhullar R.P. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was followed. The PVDF membranes were first washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.3% Tween 20, and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the same buffer containing 1 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The PVDF membranes were washed extensively with the same buffer, air dried, and then exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen (Molecular Dynamics) for 72 h. The [α-32P]GTP binding proteins were revealed by autoradiography on a Phosphor Imager (Molecular Dynamics). About 1–2 μg of purified p28 and recombinant Ral-A were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF membranes containing p28 or recombinant Ral-A were incubated for 3 h with blocking buffer (5% (w/v) powdered skim milk, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% (w/v) Tween 20) with gentle shaking at room temperature and washed three times with the same buffer. The membranes were then incubated with blocking buffer containing 80 ng/ml of biotinylated calmodulin and 1 mmCaCl2 for 2 h with continuous shaking at room temperature. In the control, 1 mm CaCl2 was replaced by 5 mm EGTA in the above steps. After three further washes with blocking buffer for 5 min each, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with 1:1000 diluted avidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) in blocking buffer at room temperature and then washed three times with blocking buffer and finally with substrate buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2). The color development was achieved by incubating the membranes in a reaction mixture containing 0.01% nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.05% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 10 ml of substrate buffer. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature until the color change was complete. The PVDF membrane-bound p28 and recombinant Ral-A were also visualized by staining with 0.1% (w/v) Amido Black, 40% (v/v) methanol, and 10% (v/v) acetic acid and destaining with 40% (v/v) methanol and 10% (v/v) acetic acid. Computer analysis of Ral-A sequence was carried out by Dr. Jose Martin-Nieto (Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Madrid, Spain). PLOT.A/GGR and PLOT.A/GOR computer programs assign the predicted secondary structure for each residue in a protein sequence and provide approximate boundaries for the helical region. PLOT.A/HEL program draws a putative helical stretch by projecting the positions of the amino acids onto a plane perpendicular to the helix axis. To quantitate the information presented on the helical wheel projection, the mean hydrophobic moment for this sequence was calculated according to the method of Erickson-Viitanen and DeGrado (31Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using the hydrophobicity scales of Eisenberg et al.(32Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). 〈μH〉=∑i=1n Hbi sin (100°×n)2+∑i=1n Hbi cos(100°×n)21/2/nEquation 1 Hb i is the hydrophobicity of theith amino acid, and n is the length of the sequence of interest. The term 100 ° corresponds to the angle at which successive side chains emerge from an α-helix when viewed down the axis. A 18-amino acid peptide (P18) with the sequence SKEKNGKKKRKSLAKRIR corresponding to a putative calmodulin-binding domain in Ral-A was synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes Pty. Ltd. P18 was then radioactively labeled with [14C]formaldehyde (DuPont NEN) by the method of Rice and Means (33Rice R.H. Means G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 831-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of 14C-labeled P18 was estimated to be 7.0 × 106 cpm/mg protein from a plot of scintillation counts/min versus peptide concentration. 5 μg of calmodulin was subjected to 6–16% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. One blot was incubated with 100 μl of [14C]P18 and 1 mm CaCl2 in 10 ml of washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.3% (w/v) Tween 20); the other was incubated with 100 μl of [14C]P18 and 1 mm EDTA in 10 ml of washing buffer separately for 30 min at room temperature. The blots were soaked in 20 ml of washing buffer and washed five times. The PVDF membrane-bound calmodulin was visualized by staining with 0.1% (w/v) Amido Black, 40% (v/v) methanol, and 10% (v/v) acetic acid and destaining with 40% (v/v) methanol and 10% (v/v) acetic acid. Blots to be counted were sliced transversely into 2-mm strips. The slices were soaked in 5 ml of Econofluor overnight and then counted in a liquid scintillation analyzer (1900A, TRI-CARB, Packard Pty. Ltd.). Constant amounts of p28 and calmodulin-agarose resin were used in all experimental procedures. Samples of p28 (about 1.5 μg) were incubated with 0.5 ml of calmodulin-agarose resin in Eppendorf tubes in a buffer containing 250 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 in the presence and in the absence of 10 μg of P18 or 10 μg of calmodulin at 4 °C overnight. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 s, supernatants were removed, and proteins (referred to as supernatant) were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The calmodulin-agarose resin samples were washed with 1.5 ml of washing buffer (200 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 10 min. The washing solutions were discarded after centrifugation at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 s. This washing step was repeated five times. The calmodulin-agarose resin samples were then incubated with 1 ml of elution buffer (200 mm KCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 5 h. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 s, the supernatants were removed, and proteins (referred to as eluent) were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis as described above. CD spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco J-720 Spectropolarimeter (Japan) connected to a Neslab RTE-111 waterbath, using a cell path length of 0.1 cm. Spectra of observed ellipticity, θ (mdeg) versus wavelength were collected between 190 and 260 nm at 15 °C. A base-line spectrum was always collected, using the same parameters, with buffer in the sample cell. Each spectrum was averaged over 8 scans, and final spectra were corrected, from the base-line spectrum, for specious signals generated by the buffer. CD spectra were measured in 5 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 with 6 μm calmodulin, or 6 μm P18, or calmodulin-P18 complex at 1:1 ratio, respectively. Calmodulin concentration was determined spectroscopically using an extinction coefficient of 3060 m−1 cm−1(31Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For quantitative analysis, data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity, [θ]MRW (deg dmol−1cm2). Ca2+-ATPase is the major calmodulin binding protein in erythrocyte membrane. When a Triton X-100 extract of human erythrocyte membrane was applied to a calmodulin-agarose column, a polypeptide of molecular mass 28 kDa on SDS-PAGE was observed to be co-eluted with Ca2+-ATPase following gradient elution with a buffer containing 2–5 mm EDTA. Ca2+-ATPase was eluted in the first one or two fractions, whereas p28 appears in the later fractions (see Fig. 1). For further purification of p28, a DEAE-cellulose column was used to limit possible contamination that is not detectable in SDS-PAGE. After passing through a DEAE-cellulose column, p28 appeared to be a clear single band in SDS-PAGE (results not shown). The yield of p28 is about 50–100 μg from 0.5 to 1.0 g of membrane protein. Eight tryptic peptides selected from the protein sample (p28) were separated by reversed phase HPLC and sequenced. One of them gave a sequence of VKEDENVPFLLVGN at an initial yield of 13.5 pmol and a repetitive yield of 84.4%. The other gave a sequence of AEQWN at an initial yield of 2.7 pmol and a repetitive yield of 79.7%. A search of the SWISS-PROT data base identified the peptides as having originated from the 23.6-kDa Ras-related protein Ral-A (SWISS-PROT accession number P11233). The two peptides came from Ral-A sequence positions 114–127 and 146–150, respectively, and were consistent with expected tryptic digestion products. Based on the absolute homology of internal peptide sequence, p28 was identified as Ral-A. The p28 amino acid composition was used to search and obtain a score in the SWISS-PROT data base. The protein at the top of the closest SWISS-PROT entries in human species as well as the closest SWISS-PROT entries in cross-species was the Ras-related, GTP-binding protein, Ral-A. Ral-A was distinguished from other protein candidates by its significant differences in score. Moreover, the protein molecular mass (which is estimated to be 28 kDa from SDS-PAGE in Fig. 1) and pI value (which is calculated to be 7.0 based on its amino acid composition) provided strong additional information to rule out incorrect candidates from the list. With these guidelines, it was concluded that Ral-A was the correct candidate for p28, because Ral-A appeared to be the highest match in both single and cross-species data base searches. Fig.2 shows the amino acid composition comparison of p28 with Ral-A obtained from SWISS-PROT (accession number P11233). p28 GTP-binding activities were detected by photoaffinity labeling and gel overlay with [α-32P]GTP (see Fig. 3). Panel A in Fig. 3 shows that p28 protein was photoaffinity labeled with [α-32P]GTP. The specificity of this labeling was evident from the ability of unlabeled 0.1 mm GTP to prevent the covalent labeling. The p28 protein band on the autoradiogram, as well as on the PVDF membrane (not shown), appeared broader than normal on SDS-PAGE, but this could be due to p28 oxidation under irradiation. Increasing covalent labeling of p28 with [α-32P]GTP corresponded to increasing irradiation time. Panel B in Fig.3 shows that p28 can be specifically labeled by [α-32P]GTP. The specificity of labeling was shown from the finding that the presence of competing substrate 0.1 mmGTP completely blocked p28 labeling with [α-32P]GTP, whereas 0.1 mm ATP did not abolish GTP-binding. When overlaid, the band on the autoradiogram fell exactly on the Amido Black-stained band detected on the PVDF membrane. Low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins are known to renature after being electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes or nitrocellulose blots (unlike heterotrimeric Gα protein) and exhibit specific binding to guanine nucleotides following incubation of the blots with [α-32P]GTP (30Bhullar R.P. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36Bhullar R.P. Chardin P. Haslam R.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that a renatured form of p28 on PVDF membrane retains the ability to specifically bind to GTP. It was therefore concluded that p28 is a low molecular mass GTP-binding protein, consistent with its identification as Ral-A or a highly related Ral-A protein.

The binding interaction is of low affinity and has a fast off-rate (>5 s−1) in solution. However, solution measurements may not accurately predict the behavior of molecules in an adhesive contact area. Interaction between T cells that express CD2 and glass-supported planar bilayers containing purified and fluorescently labeled CD58 leads to accumulation of CD58 (fluorescence) in the cell/bilayer contact area. CD58 molecules accumulated within the contact area in excess of the CD58 density in the bilayer outside the contact area can be considered as bound by cell surface CD2. Here, this phenomena and fluorescence photobleaching recovery were utilized to determine whether CD2-CD58 bonds are transient in contact areas. Fluorescent CD58 molecules accumulated in the T cell-bilayer interface were completely bleached. The bleached CD58 molecules accumulated in the contact area were rapidly replaced by fluorescent CD58 that diffused into the contact area from adjacent bilayer regions outside the contact area. Rapid recovery of the accumulated fluorescence directly demonstrates that the CD2-CD58 bonds are dissociating and that the dissociation leads to partner exchange, rather than rebinding of the same CD2-CD58 pairs. This suggests that the solution off-rate provides an accurate description of CD2-CD58 interaction in contact areas. Accumulated fluorescent IgG in contacts between K562 cells expressing low affinity Fc receptors and planar bilayers with fluorescent IgG bound to hapten-derivitized phospholipids displayed slower recovery than CD58 by a factor of 10.

These findings have implications for the mechanism of signaling by CD2 and the mechanism of cell detachment from large numbers of transient interactions. Specific binding of membrane receptors across a small gap between neighboring cells is an exquisitely specific mode of communication. In the immune response, the fundamental regulatory and effector functions of T lymphocytes require contact with antigen presenting cells or target cells, respectively (1Zinkernagel R.M. Doherty P.C. Nature. 1974; 251: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 2Unanue E.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 395-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the molecular basis of these cell-cell interactions emphasize the role of low affinity, transient receptor-ligand interactions, both for cell-cell adhesion and direct cell-cell signaling functions (3Davis S.J. van der Merwe P.A. Immunology Today. 1996; 17: 177-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 4Matsui K. Boniface J.J. Steffner P. Reay P.A. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12862-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, these measurements have been made in solution and may not accurately predict the behavior of molecules in contact areas. Therefore, it is important to directly determine the properties of transient molecular interactions in contact areas. The T lymphocyte glycoprotein CD2 and its ligand CD58 play an important role in stabilizing adhesion between T cells and antigen-presenting or target cells (3Davis S.J. van der Merwe P.A. Immunology Today. 1996; 17: 177-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 5Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). CD2 and CD58 are closely related members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (5Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The accumulation of CD58 in contacts between T cells and bilayers containing fluorescently labeled CD58 has been used to determine the density of CD2-CD58 complexes as a function of free CD58 density. The two-dimensional K d calculated from this data is 21 molecules/μm2 (6Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.-Y. Springer T.A. Golan D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This suggests that CD2-CD58 interactions operate efficiently at physiological densities of CD2 and CD58 that exceed 100 molecules/μm2. The solution K d for the CD2-CD58 interaction is 5 μm, and the off-rate is >5 s−1 (3Davis S.J. van der Merwe P.A. Immunology Today. 1996; 17: 177-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Since the three-dimensional and two-dimensionalK d values for the interaction of CD2 and CD58 have been determined under similar conditions, it is possible to calculate the third dimension for the interaction: the third dimension is calculated at 5 nm (6Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.-Y. Springer T.A. Golan D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This is the size of a single Ig domain. We would interpret this number as the range of oscillations in the distance between membranes and in adhesion molecule tilting that generate the third dimension for the interaction. When these bonds dissociate there may be a significant probability of rebinding of the same pair of molecules, since they are not immediately removed from each other's presence except by lateral diffusion (7Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effective off-rate of CD2-CD58 bonds, the rate at which pairs of molecules actually diffuse free of each other, may be much lower than the intrinsic off-rate deduced in solution from the kinetic off-rate. The CD2-CD58 system provides an opportunity to test the hypothesis that low affinity bonds are effectively transient in contact areas. In the CD2-CD58 system, the interaction can drive striking accumulation of CD58 in the contact area between a cell and an artificial bilayer containing fluorescently labeled CD58, which is observed by fluorescence microscopy. Here, a brief laser pulse was used to eliminate CD58 fluorescence in the entire cell-bilayer contact area, and digital fluorescence imaging was used to monitor the spatially resolved fluorescence intensity prior to and at various times after the laser pulse. If the bonds are transient and the CD2 and CD58 molecules exchange partners rapidly, the fluorescence in the contact area should recover rapidly. If the bonds are transient but dissociated pairs rebound rapidly without partner exchange, or if the bonds became stable through a contact-specific mechanism, then the recovery of fluorescence would be slow or nonexistent. The results show that bond turnover is rapid at low and high free CD58 densities and in nonactivated and activated cells. The low affinity Fc receptor on K562 cells displayed slower recovery, suggesting a longer effective bond lifetime, which is consistent with solution measurements. These results demonstrate that the rapid off-rate of the CD2-CD58 bond is evident in contact areas with constrained diffusion of molecules The TS2/9, TS2/18, and Jurkat cell lines were obtained from ATCC. The CD2.1 antibody was a gift of D. Olive or was purchased from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 1The abbreviations used are: FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DNP, dinitrophenol; FPR, fluorescence photobleaching recovery; NBD, 7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; TCR, T cell antigen receptor. was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. The optical path is diagrammed in Fig. 1. A 1-mm beam from a 2-watt argon laser (Coherent, Palo Alto, CA) tuned to the 488-nm line was expanded with a −25-mm focal length plano-convex lens (25.2-mm diameter). The diverging beam was then focused through one 400-mm focal length acromat (40-mm diameter) and one 500-mm focal length acromat (63-mm diameter) that were positioned on a rail such that they could be moved independently along the axis of the beam. Movement of these lenses changed the focal point of the laser beam with respect to the sample. The focused beam passed through a 45° beam splitter that was used to merge the laser and xenon arc lamp light paths. The xenon arc lamp output was focused by a quartz condenser. Both of these beams pass through an adjustable aperture that acted as a field diaphragm for the arc lamp, the outline of which was imaged on the sample plane when the objective was focused at the coverslip/media interface. The field diaphragm did not interfere with the laser transmission, since it was focused to a small point at this position. The final lens element before the objective was a 200-mm focal length acromat that was positioned 100 mm from the dichroic mirror used for epi-illumination. The images were formed with Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) infinity-corrected optics on a cooled CCD chip (Eastman Kodak Co. KAF1400, grade 2) of a Photometrics (Tuscon, AZ) PXL camera. The excitation filter, dichroic mirror, and emission filters were independently selected with filter wheels and single mirror sliders. For most experiments, the dichroic mirror was a 505-nm-long pass, and the emission filter was a 530-nm band pass. Fluorescence excitation was performed with a 485-nm band pass filter. Interference-reflection images were performed with 530-nm excitation and neutral density filters. Although the 530-nm light was not efficiently reflected by the dichroic mirror, more than enough light for the CCD was reflected, and neutral density filters of 1–2 OD units were required on the excitation path to obtain usable exposure times. Images were acquired directly into a Macintosh computer using IP lab software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Fluorescence images were usually acquired with 10 × 10 camera pixels/image pixel (10 × 10 binning) to increase sensitivity and to allow image acquisition without significant photobleaching. A camera pixel was 68 nm square with × 100 objective. IP lab was also used to control the excitation filter wheel and shutter timing through a serial port-linked control box (Ludl, Hawthorne, NY). The microscope system was designed in collaboration with and assembled by Yona Microscopes (Silver Spring, MD). Cells were fixed after adhesion to bilayers with 1% paraformaldehyde, and slides were mounted under a solution of 0.2% N-propylgallate in phosphate-buffered saline. Confocal images were obtained with a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) Confocal system interfaced with a Zeiss Axioscope. CD58 was purified from human erythrocytes by immunoaffinity chromatography on TS2/9 IgG linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (8Dustin M.L. Sanders M.E. Shaw S. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 677-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The purified protein was bound again to TS2/9-Sepharose CL-4B and labeled with 8 mm FITC in bicarbonate buffer pH 9 (6Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.-Y. Springer T.A. Golan D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The labeled protein was eluted at pH 3 and reconstituted into unilamellar liposomes by detergent dialysis (9Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Glass-supported planar bilayers were then formed by incubating the liposome suspensions (0.4 mm) with clean glass coverslips (10Brian A.A. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The density of molecules in the resulting bilayers was determined by radiometric binding assays with iodinated TS2/9 IgG of known specific activity. Radiometric assays were done with bilayers formed on one side of a 12-mm, round coverslip in wells of 24-well cluster plates. Prior to elution of bound iodine, the coverslips were transferred under buffer to a clean 24-well plate to avoid detection of liposomes bound to the plastic well. Bilayers containing FITC-CD58 or unlabeled CD58 were formed on glass coverslips in a parallel plate flow cells (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). The bilayers were blocked with bovine serum albumin, and the experiments were performed in Hepes-buffered saline (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mmNa2PO4, 5 mmd-glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin). The cells were allowed to settle on the bilayers and were observed to form contacts over a period of 20 min as described previously (6Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.-Y. Springer T.A. Golan D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). When images were acquired with the × 100 objective and 2 × 2 binning, a bleaching correction of 0.8 was applied to allow comparison of images acquired over time. Images acquired with 10 × 10 binning could be acquired sequentially without significant bleaching. Flat field images were acquired by averaging together 10 images of a uniform 2% NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine, 98% egg phosphatidylcholine planar bilayer. The fluorescence spectrum of NBD overlaps with that of fluorescein, and this has been the fluorophore of choice for labeling phospholipids due to its small size. The flat field and bias images (no excitation light) were used to correct the experimental images: corrected = ((experimental − bias)/(flat field − bias)) × average intensity of flat field. The laser spot size was adjusted using NBD-containing bilayers either to image the beam or to bleach holes in the bilayer. The spot size was adjusted so that it would bleach an object the size of a cell/bilayer contact area (50–100 μm2). The duration of bleaching and the laser power were determined empirically to be the lowest necessary to achieve complete elimination of accumulated fluorescence. Typically, the laser output at 488 nm was 400–500 milliwatts, and bleach duration of 20–50 ms was used. Prebleach and a series of timed postbleach images were acquired with 10 × 10 binning. IRM images were acquired before and after the series and were sometimes acquired during the recovery period to determine whether the bleach pulse altered the contact area. The bleaching and recovery data were expressed relative toI b, the specific intensity of the fluorescent adhesion molecules in the bilayer. This allows comparison of bleaching data where the density of free CD58 in the bilayers varies over a 20-fold range. The bright fluorescent contact areas in the prebleach images were identified using the segmentation feature of IP-lab. This mask was then used to analyze the prebleach and recovery images in which the targeted cell was initially nonfluorescent. The contact area intensities were measured at different time points. The bilayer fluorescence intensities were extracted by comparison with images of unlabeled bilayers acquired with the same settings. Cellular autofluorescence was variable but was minimized when the Jurkat cells were maintained in log phase growth. The autofluorescence on each day and at different times during the course of experiments was monitored by imaging cells on bilayers with unlabeled CD58. The autofluorescence was found to be partially bleached and did not recover over 550 s. Therefore, an appropriate autofluorescence correction was applied to the data acquired with fluorescent CD58 based on the behavior of autofluorescence on that day using the same bleach and imaging parameters. An imaging system was designed to perform FPR experiments (11Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar) with a large bleach spot to eliminate the fluorescence in an entire cell/substrate contact area of up to 100 μm2. The microscope system used for digital imaging FPR is similar to the system utilized by Kapitza et al. (12Kapitza H.G. McGregor G. Jacobson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4122-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) for video FPR. The beam from a 2-watt argon laser was expanded and focused on the sample plane. The focal point of the laser could be shifted with respect to the image plane so that the diverging (defocused) beam could be used for bleaching (13Yechiel E. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The diverging beam is still gaussian on average but contains interference patterns. The interference patterns did not alter the effectiveness of bleaching (not shown). The laser beam was merged with the output from a xenon arc lamp using a beam splitter (Fig.1). A field diaphragm could be used without interfering with the laser beam intensity. This was important for use of interference reflection microscopy, where the field diaphragm is used to restrict scattered light (14Izzard C.S. Lochner L. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 129-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The laser beam and arc lamp output were independently controlled by fast electronic shutters. The sample was imaged using wide field epi-illumination and the cooled CCD camera. The bleaching system was characterized using the NBD-PE-containing planar bilayers. The diffusion coefficient for NBD-PE in an egg PC-based planar bilayer is 1 μm2/s (6Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.-Y. Springer T.A. Golan D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fig.2 a shows images of an experiment with NBD-PE in an egg PC-based planar bilayer. The half-time for recovery for small, medium, and large bleach spots were <3, 16, and 24 s, respectively (Fig. 2 b). The effective beam radii (w), calculated from the relationshipt½ = w 2/4D, where D is the diffusion coefficient (15Elson E.L. Qian H. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), were 3.5, 8, and 10 μm for these bleach spots. These are estimates, since monitoring was performed with wide field illumination rather than a gaussian beam laser. However, these estimated beam radii were in agreement with the size of the dark central areas of the bleach spots. Therefore, this system could be used to measure relative changes in two-dimensional diffusion in larger regions than classical FPR. The CD2-CD58 interaction occurs through a complementary interaction of two charged faces of the membrane distal Ig domain. The experiments below required that the lysyl residues in the binding interface be protected from modification with fluorophores. Therefore, CD58 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (through lysyl residues) while bound to the adhesion-blocking antibody TS2/9. This was previously shown to result in full retention of activity in adhesion assays (6Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.-Y. Springer T.A. Golan D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The FITC-CD58 was reconstituted into small unilaminar liposomes of egg PC by detergent dialysis and matched liposomes of egg PC only were prepared in parallel. Glass-supported planar bilayers were formed by incubating the liposomes suspensions with clean glass coverslips (10Brian A.A. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The site density of CD58 was measured by radioimmunoassay with the TS2/9 antibody. It was found that different uniform densities of CD58 could be achieved by diluting the FITC-CD58-containing egg PC liposomes with matched egg PC liposomes and then forming the planar bilayers as usual. The site density measure by radiometric assay was linearly related to the proportion of the CD58 liposomes in the mixture (Fig.3). The resulting bilayers show uniform fluorescence. Apparently, the CD58 liposomes and the CD58 free liposomes have an equal potential to fuse to form planar bilayers, and after fusion, the CD58 redistributes by diffusion. This method was used to prepare bilayers with 750 and 35 molecules/μm2 of CD58. Large spot photobleaching on the CD58 bilayers revealed a diffusion coefficient similar to that for NBD-PE, consistent with the concept that glycolipid-anchored CD58 interacts with the bilayer in the manner of a phospholipid (not shown). The human T lymphoma cell line Jurkat has a high level of CD2 expression (70,000–80,000 CD2 molecules/cell). Jurkat cells adhered efficiently to bilayers with 750 molecules/μm2 of CD58 and with somewhat reduced efficiency to bilayers with 35 molecules/μm2. Adhesive contact areas that were detectable by interference reflection microscopy rapidly accumulated FITC-CD58 molecules based on fluorescence imaging. Contacts initially expanded in area and often included a main central contact and satellite contacts that appeared to be formed by radially arranged membrane protrusions. These satellites of fluorescent CD58 frequently merged into the main contact area after 20 min at room temperature (Fig. 4). After 20 min, the shape of the contacts did not change. Cell surface CD2 is laterally mobile and would also be expected to redistribute into contact areas (16Liu S.J. Hahn W.C. Bierer B.E. Golan D.E. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CD2 redistribution was followed using the nonadhesion-blocking anti-CD2 mAb, CD2.1 (6F10) (17Dustin M.L. Olive D. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CD2.1 was labeled with FITC. Jurkat cells were preincubated with FITC-CD2.1 to saturate all CD2 sites and then were washed and incubated on CD11a-CD18 (LFA-1) or CD58 containing planar bilayers (Fig.5). LFA-1 binds to CD54 (ICAM-1) on the Jurkat cells and was not expected to disturb the distribution of CD2. After 1 h, the cells were fixed, and the distribution of CD2 was examined by confocal microscopy. CD2 displayed striking redistribution to the contact area with CD58 bilayers, but not LFA-1 bilayers. Many FITC-CD2.1-labeled Jurkat cells adhering to CD58 still showed specific fluorescence in noncontact membranes. This suggests that free CD2 was distributed over the cell surface. FPR experiments were performed to determine whether CD2-CD58 bond dynamics could be visualized through fluorescence recovery after bleaching of FITC on CD58 molecules in the contact area. It was assumed that photobleaching does not alter the function of the CD58 molecules. This was strongly supported by the observation that the contact area, as measured by the independent IRM method, does not change over the course of the FPR experiment (not shown). If the CD58 were functionally altered, then some acute change in the contact area would be expected. Fig. 6 a shows image data from a bleaching experiment at a free CD58 density of 750 molecules/μm2. Under these conditions, recovery was nearly complete in 2–3 min. Since all the fluorescence accumulated in the contact area was eliminated as shown by the first postbleach image, it was not possible to account for this recovery in terms of diffusion of the CD2-CD58 bonds within the contact area as was possible in our prior study with conventional FPR (6Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.-Y. Springer T.A. Golan D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fast off-rate of the CD2-CD58 interaction was manifested as rapid partner exchange between CD2 and CD58 in the contact area. The time required to restore the accumulated fluorescent CD58 to the prebleach level may be dependent on the free CD58 density. This effect would be expected based on the dependence of the flux rate for FITC-CD58 molecules through the contact area on the free FITC-CD58 density. However, an additional component would be the density of free CD58 molecules that could act as competitors to block rebinding of recently dissociated CD2-CD58 bonds. FPR data from experiments with different free FITC-CD58 densities are expressed in terms of free CD58 equivalents. Thus for 750 or 35 molecules/μm2, 1I b unit = 750 or 35 molecules/μm2, respectively. When the free CD58 density was 750 or 35 molecules/μm2, the time required to restore the accumulated fluorescence to one free CD58 equivalent over the bilayer level was nearly identical (Fig. 6, b–d). The time required for recovery of one I b unit was nearly always 30–40 s in the early stages of recovery, very similar to the half time for recovery of the NBD-PE (Fig. 2). Nearly identical results were obtained when cells were treated with phorbol myristate-acetate to increase CD2 avidity (18Hahn W.C. Bierer B.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1831-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or with the CD2.1 IgG that can activate cells in concert with CD58 (17Dustin M.L. Olive D. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Part of this early recovery is due to the restoration of the bleached free-CD58 in and around the contact area, but it was clear that the accumulated CD58 in the contact area showed recovery even before the surrounding free CD58 had fully recovered (Fig. 5 a, 13-s image). Thus, it appears that the turnover of the CD2-CD58 bonds in the contact area was nearly diffusion-limited. This was consistent with the fast off-rate of the CD2-CD58 bonds in solution of >5 s−1 (19van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the dissociation of CD2 from CD58 was followed by diffusion of the free CD58 away from the CD2 receptor so that it can bind another CD2 molecule or diffuse out of the contact area. This property was not regulated by cell activation or parallel ligation of CD2 with the CD2.1 antibody. To determine if this kind of dynamic behavior was associated with another low affinity receptor system, we studied the low affinity Fc receptor II expressed on K562 cells. Bilayers were prepared with 2% DNP-PE in egg PC and were labeled with FITC-rabbit anti-DNP IgG. Fig.7 shows that the recovery of accumulated fluorescence is not as rapid with Fc receptor II-IgG as with CD2-CD58 but that recovery was clear at later time points. The recovery rate of bound IgG was at least 10-fold slower than bound CD58 based on the apparent half-time extrapolated from the data acquired. Therefore, the recovery time course for accumulated fluorescence in cell-bilayer contacts was clearly dependent on the molecular details of the receptor-ligand system. The novel finding of this report is that the CD2-CD58 bond displays striking dynamics in contact areas. This result resolves the question of whether the fast off-rate of bonds in solution is observed in cell-cell contact areas where rebinding of dissociated receptors and ligands might suppress observable turnover of transiently bound ligand molecules (7Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar). A degree of this dynamic behavior was also displayed by the low affinity Fc receptor of K562 cells interacting with IgG on a planar substrate. The major off-rate for the interaction of low affinity Fc receptors with IgG in solution is 1.4 s−1, significantly slower than the off-rate for interaction of CD2 and CD58, >5 s−1 (20Hsieh H.V. Thompson N.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12481-12488Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The exchange of CD58 molecules appeared to be nearly diffusion-limited, but the exchange of IgG molecules engaged by low affinity Fc receptors was much slower. It was critical to use imaging-based FPR in these experiments in contrast to spot or line-scan FPR experiments. By this method, we could establish that all the accumulated CD58 or Fc receptor molecules had their FITC bleached and that recovery occurred by an exchange reaction with unbleached FITC-labeled molecules from outside the contact area. Transient binding is likely to be prevalent for Ig family members and many o"
https://openalex.org/W2126190334,"Thiamin pyrophosphate is an essential cofactor that is synthesized de novo by Salmonella typhimurium. In bacteria, the end product of the de novo biosynthetic pathway is thiamin monophosphate, which is then phosphorylated by thiamin-monophosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.16) to form thiamin pyrophosphate. We have isolated and characterized the thiL gene of S. typhimurium and showed that thiL is a 978-base pair open reading frame encoding a 35-kDa protein with thiamin-monophosphate kinase activity. thiL was located in the 10-centisome region of the S. typhimurium chromosome. We demonstrated that altered thiamin-monophosphate kinase activity resulted in decreased repression of transcription of thiamin pyrophosphate-regulated thiamin biosynthetic genes. In contrast to other thi loci, thiL is not transcriptionally regulated by thiamin pyrophosphate. This result is consistent with a dual role for ThiL in de novo biosynthesis and in salvage of exogenous thiamin."

Chem. 272, 15980–15985), synaptojanin is identified as a protein that inhibits phospholipase D (PLD) activity stimulated by ADP-ribosylation factor and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Here, the purification from rat brain cytosol of another PLD-inhibitory protein that is immunologically distinct from synaptojanin is described, and this protein is identified as clathrin assembly protein 3 (AP3) by peptide sequencing and immunoblot analysis. AP3 binds both inositol hexakisphosphate and preassembled clathrin cages with high affinity. However, neither inositol hexakisphosphate binding nor clathrin cage binding affected the ability of AP3 to inhibit PLD. AP3 also binds to PI(4,5)P2 with low affinity. But the PI(4,5)P2 binding was not responsible for PLD inhibition, because the potency and efficacy of AP3 as an inhibitor of PLD were similar in the absence and presence of PI(4,5)P2. A bacterially expressed fusion protein, glutathioneS-transferase-AP3 (GST-AP3), also inhibited PLD with a potency equal to that of brain AP3. The inhibitory effect of AP3 appeared to be the result of direct interaction between AP3 and PLD because PLD bound GST-AP3 in an in vitro binding assay. Using GST fusion proteins containing various AP3 sequences, we found that the sequence extending from residues Pro-290 to Lys-320 of AP3 is critical for both inhibition of and binding to PLD. The fact that AP3 is a synapse-specific protein indicates that the AP3-dependent inhibition of PLD might play a regulatory role that is restricted to the rapid cycling of synaptic vesicles.

Fractions corresponding to the major peak (5 mg of protein) from the last column were dialyzed against buffer A (10 mm Mes-NaOH (pH 6.5), 1 mm EDTA, and leupeptin and aprotinin (each at 1 μg/ml)) and then applied to a Mono-S 5/5 column that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in buffer A for 60 min (Fig.1 A), and fractions (1.0 ml) were collected and assayed for PLD-inhibitory activity. The peak fractions (fractions 25–28) were pooled and concentrated. Three-fourths of the resulting sample was divided into aliquots and stored at −70 °C. The remaining one-fourth (260 μg of protein in 50 μl) was applied to Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 column (3.2 × 300 mm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and chromatography was performed with a Pharmacia-LKB SMART System equipped with a μ separation unit and a μ precision pump. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 40 μl/min with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl (Fig.1 B).

The sulfhydryl groups were labeled with 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate by adding Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the resulting conjugated protein was precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was washed with cold acetone, suspended in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), and digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin. The generated peptides were applied to a C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Vydac) that had been equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 60-ml linear gradient of 0–60% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were detected by measuring absorbance at 215 nm. An expression vector (pGEX-3X-F1–20 (AS15−)) that encodes a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and full-length (915-residue) bovine AP3 has been described (4Zhou S. Tannery N.H. Yang J. Puszkin S. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12655-12662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncated DNAs corresponding to the NH2-terminal 289 amino acid residues (AP3-(1–289)), NH2-terminal 320 residues (AP3-(1–320)), and COOH-terminal 595 residues (AP3-(321–915)) were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using the plasmid pGEX-3X-F1–20 (AS15−) as the template. The 5′ primer (AAAAAAGCGGCCGCAAATGTCGGGCCAAACGCTC) for AP3-(1–289) and AP3-(1–320) contained a NotI site. The 3′ primers for AP3-(1–289) (AAAAAAGCGGCCGCTTATTTCTTTCCTTCTAGGG) and AP3-(1–320) (AAAAAAGCGGCCGCTTATTTAGCTGGTGTAGAATTAGG) also contained aNotI site. For AP3-(321–915), a BamHI site-containing 5′ primer (AAAAAAGGATCCACTATCGACACGTCCCCAC) and anEcoRI site-containing 3′ primer (AAAAAAGAATTCTTACAAGAAATCCTTGATG) were used. The polymerase chain reaction products were purified, digested withNotI or BamHI and EcoRI, and ligated into pGEX-4T1 (Pharmacia) to construct the respective GST fusion protein expression vector. Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transfected with each of the expression vectors. The vectors obtained were retransfected into E. coli BL21 cells. The colonies containing each vector were grown at 37 °C. Expression of the fusion proteins was then induced for 6 h at 30 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was mixed with a 50% (w/v) slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min, the resulting pellet was washed with 10 volumes of PBS containing protease inhibitors including N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (0.5 μg/ml),N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (0.5 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and aprotinin (1 μg/ml). Proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads by incubation at room temperature for 30 min with one volume of 10 mm reduced glutathione. SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluted proteins revealed a major protein band (>90%) with the predicted molecular size for each of the truncated GST-AP3 fusion proteins. However, the preparation of the full-length GST-AP3 showed a number of smaller bands in addition to the major band of 190 kDa for GST-AP3 plus several smaller bands. This probably reflects the extreme susceptibility of AP3 to proteolytic degradation (5Prasad K. Lippoldt P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6098-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Murphy J.-E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further purification of GST-AP3 on a Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 column improved the purity of the 190-kDa protein preparation to 70%. However, storage at −70 °C and subsequent thawing resulted in significant degradation. Phospholipid vesicles containing either PE and PC in a molar ratio of 16:1 or PE, PI(4,5)P2 and PC in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 were added to polycarbonate tubes (7 by 20 mm, Beckman) containing AP3 (inhibitor IB fraction from Mono-S column). The final reaction mixture contained 3.4 μm PC in a total volume of 30 μl of 20 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.5). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min and subsequently on ice for 5 min, the tubes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was saved, and the pellet was rinsed once with 30 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and subsequently resuspended in 30 μl of the same buffer. Both supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel and subsequent immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibodies to AP3. The amounts of AP3, GST-AP3, GST-AP3-(1–289), GST-AP3-(1–320), GST-AP3-(321–915), and GST were determined spectrophotometrically with extinction coefficients (ε280) of 39,970, 80,650, 60,100, 60,100, 65,590, and 40,680, respectively (7Ye W.

Clathrin triskelia were assembled into cages by dialyzing overnight against isolation buffer (0.1 m Mes (pH 6.5), 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mmCaCl2) as described (8Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10933-10939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The assembled cages were precipitated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, washed three times with 500 μl of the isolation buffer, and suspended in 150 μl of the buffer. The clathrin cage solution was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min to remove nonspecific aggregates. Complexes of AP3 with clathrin cage were formed by incubating preassembled clathrin cages at 0.45 μm (corresponding to the molarity of the triskelia) and 4.5 μm AP3 in 400 μl of isolation buffer without CaCl2 for 1 h on ice with rocking. The clathrin cage-AP3 complex was precipitated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and was washed three times with 500 μl of the isolation buffer without CaCl2. The 1:1 stoichiometry of clathrin triskelia and AP3 in the complex (5Prasad K. Lippoldt P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6098-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis using antibodies to AP3. GST or GST fusion proteins containing AP3-(1–289), AP3-(1–320), or AP3-(321–915) were incubated with hPLD1 for 30 min on ice. The final reaction mixture contained 1 μm GST or GST fusion protein and partial purified hPLD in 1.5 μg of total protein in a total volume of 150 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.7%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside). Ten microliters of 50% (w/v) slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added to the mixture and incubated for 5 min on ice with rocking. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min, the resulting supernatants were transferred and the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml each of the binding buffer. Both the pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and hPLD1 was visualized by alkaline phosphatase-immunoblotting using rabbit antibodies to hPLD1 (3Hammond S.C.

We previously showed that chromatography of rat brain cytosol on a DEAE-Sephacel column yielded three partially resolved peaks when fractions were assayed for the ability to inhibit PLD activated by ARF and PI(4,5)P2 (1Han J.-S.

Fractions corresponding to the first peak were further purified by high performance liquid chromatography on DEAE-5PW and phenyl-5PW columns, the latter of which yielded two well separated peaks, termed IA and IB. Chromatography of peak fractions containing inhibitor IB on a heparin-5PW column yielded one major and two minor inhibitor peaks (1Han J.-S. Chung J.-K. Kang H.-S. Donaldson J. Bae Y.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11163-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have now subjected fractions corresponding to the major peak to sequential chromatography on a Mono-S column (Fig. 1 A) and a Superose 12 gel filtration column (Fig. 1 B). These procedures yielded single peak of PLD-inhibitory activity corresponding to an estimated molecular size of 370 kDa. Analysis of the peak fractions by SDS-PAGE revealed three broad bands with apparent molecular masses of 165, 155, and 135 kDa, as well as several minor bands (Fig. 1 C). Repeating the purification procedure revealed that the relative abundance of the three proteins varied (as the relative intensity of the 165-kDa band decreased, those of the 155- and 135-kDa bands increased) and that the inhibitory activity correlated with none of the three bands alone but rather with the sum of all three. These results suggest that the three proteins are related and components of the PLD inhibitor IB. The inhibitor IB preparation from the gel filtration column was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were isolated on a C18 column (Fig. 2). Four of the purified peptides were sequenced and all four sequences matched exactly those of rat AP3 (9Zhou S. Sousa R. Tannery N.H. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2144-2155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Morris S.A. Schröder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); peptides 1–4 corresponded to AP3 residues 150–157, 789–795, 113–128, and 872–886, respectively. Immunoblot analysis of inhibitor IB from the Mono-S column with a monoclonal antibody to AP3 detected not only the protein with 165-kDa protein but also the 155- and 135-kDa proteins (see Fig. 4), suggesting that the three proteins correspond to AP3 and its proteolytic fragments. The PLD inhibitor IB is therefore subsequently referred to as AP3. It was previously shown that AP3 migrates anomalously on SDS-PAGE because the high density of acidic residues in the central domain interferes with SDS binding. Its apparent molecular mass ranges from 155 to 185 kDa depending on the conditions, whereas its molecular mass predicted from the corresponding cDNA is 91.4 kDa (9Zhou S. Sousa R. Tannery N.H.

The final concentration of AP3 was 104 nm. After centrifugation of the incubation mixtures, pellets (P) and supernatants (S) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and subsequent immunoblot analysis with the monoclonal antibody to AP3. The 165-, 155-, and 135-kDa forms of AP3 are indicated by arrowson the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To exclude the possibility that a contaminating protein accounted for the inhibition of PLD activity, we compared the effects of GST-AP3 and purified rat brain AP3 (from the final gel filtration column) on hPLD1 activity. Bacterially expressed GST-AP3 was purified with the use of glutathione-Sepharose beads and gel filtration chromatography. Both AP3 (from rat brain) and GST-AP3 inhibited hPLD1 activity stimulated by ARF and PI(4,5)P2 in a concentration-dependent manner and exhibited similar potencies. GST alone had no effect on hPLD1 activity (Fig. 3). AP3 binds inositol polyphosphates with high affinity (7Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Norris F.A. Ungewickell E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 214-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because many inositol polyphosphate-binding proteins also bind PI(4,5)P2, it was possible that AP3 inhibited PLD activity by masking PI(4,5)P2. We therefore evaluated the ability of AP3 to bind PI(4,5)P2 with the use of lipid vesicles of identical composition to those used for the PLD assay. The amount of AP3 that associated with the PI(4,5)P2-containing vesicles was markedly greater than that associated with lipid vesicles containing only PE and PC (Fig. 4). When the amount of AP3 added to lipid vesicles was reduced by one-half, the ratio of the amount of AP3 associated with the pellet to that present in the supernatant was not affected (data not shown), suggesting that the number of binding sites was not a limiting factor. When the pellets were washed more than once, the amount of AP3 associated with the vesicles devoid of PI(4,5)P2 decreased to virtually undetectable levels, and the amount of AP3 associated with the PI(4,5)P2-containing vesicles was also reduced proportionally (data not shown). These results suggest that AP3 interacts with PI(4,5)P2 with low affinity. The AP3-dependent inhibition of hPLD1, which is stimulated by ARF and PI(4,5)P2, was measured with substrate vesicles containing PE and [choline-methyl-3H](pam)2PC and either containing or not containing PI(4,5)P2. The ARF-dependent activity of hPLD1 in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 is ∼5% of that in its presence, so the amount of hPLD1 used to measure activity in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 was 20 times that used in presence. AP3 inhibited the generation of [3H]choline with similar efficacies and potencies in the presence and absence of PI(4,5)P2 (Fig.5 A). To confirm this result, we measured the production of phosphatidylethanol (PEtOH), as well as that of phosphatidic acid (PA), from [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H](pam)2PC in the presence of ethanol. The production of both PEtOH and PA was inhibited by 43 nm AP3 to similar extents in the absence and presence of PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that the inhibition of hPLD1 by AP3 is not attributable to the weak interaction of AP3 with PI(4,5)P2. We next investigated the effects of AP3 on the activities of PLC-β1, PLC-γ1, and PLC-δ1 with substrate vesicles identical to those used for the PLD assay, with the exception that the 3H-labeled lipid was PI(4,5)P2 rather than PC. At a concentration (62 nm) at which PLD activity was nearly maximally inhibited, AP3 did not substantially affect the activities of the various PLC isoforms (data not shown). These data support the notion that the weak binding of AP3 to PI(4,5)P2-containing vesicles does not reduce the effective concentration of this phospholipid on the vesicle surface. The concentration-dependent inhibition of hPLD1 by AP3 was measured at three different concentrations of ARF and PC. The inhibition profiles were virtually identical when the concentrations of ARF and PC were reduced by up to 95 and 75%, respectively, suggesting that inhibition does not result from competition of AP3 with either ARF or PC for binding to PLD (data not shown). AP3 binds IP6 with a dissociation constant of 0.24–1.2 μm, and IP6 inhibits the interaction of AP3 with clathrin (7Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Norris F.A. Ungewickell E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 214-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). At a concentration of 15 μm, however, IP6 had no effect on the inhibition of PLD by AP3 measured in the absence or presence of PI(4,5)P2 (data not shown). AP3 also binds clathrin cages with a high affinity (8Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10933-10939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the capacity of the cage-bound AP3 to inhibit PLD was similar to that of free AP3 (Fig. 6). Clathrin cages alone did not affect PLD significantly. These results suggest that the region of the AP3 that interacts with clathrin cages differs from that responsible for interaction with PLD and that the inhibitory function of AP3 is not affected by its cage binding. Previous studies demonstrated that AP3 is readily cleaved by trypsin into a 33-kDa (often a mixture of 30- and 33-kDa) NH2-terminal and a 58-kDa COOH-terminal fragment (6Murphy J.-E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10933-10939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The clathrin assembly activity is associated with the 58-kDa fragment, whereas the 33-kDa fragment contains a high affinity binding site for IP6 (8Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10933-10939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To localize the region responsible for the PLD inhibition, AP3 was subjected to limited digestion by trypsin, followed by separation on a gel filtration column. Two protein peaks were observed (Fig. 7 A). The SDS-PAGE indicated that the first peak contained several proteins of higher apparent molecular mass (130–180-kDa species), whereas the second peak was mainly composed of the partially resolved 30- and 33-kDa fragments (Fig. 7 B). The 30- and 33-kDa fragments as well as the 58-kDa fragment, which is known to migrate abnormally on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (seen as an apparent 100-kDa species) and known to be poorly stained by Coomassie Blue because of its high content of acidic residues, were also detected in the first peak by immunoblot with antibodies to AP3 (data not shown), suggesting that under non-denaturing conditions parts of the 30- and 33-kDa fragments remain associated with the the acidic 58-kDa fragment. The proteins in both the first and second peaks inhibited hPLD1, and the inhibitory activity of the second peak correlated better with the elution profile of the 33-kDa protein than with that of the 30-kDa protein. The 30- and 33-kDa proteins were eluted from excised gel bands, and the sequences of their NH2-terminal 12 residues were determined; both sequences were the same as the NH2-terminal sequence of AP3. These results suggest that the NH2-terminal 33-kDa contains the region required for PLD inhibition and its COOH-terminal 3-kDa region might be critical for interaction with hPLD1. To further delineate the AP3 sequence involved in hPLD1 inhibition, we prepared GST fusion proteins containing the NH2-terminal 289 amino acid residues (AP3-(1–289)), NH2-terminal 320 residues (AP3-(1–320)), or COOH-terminal 595 residues (AP3-(321–915)) and tested their abilities to inhibit hPLD1. GST-AP3-(1–320) was nearly as potent as AP3, whereas GST-AP3-(321–915) and GST-AP3-(1–289) had almost no effect (Fig. 8). It appears, therefore, that NH2-terminal 320 residues but not the COOH-terminal 576 residues of AP3 are important for interaction with hPLD1 and that the sequence extending from residues Pro-290 to Lys-320 of AP3 is critical for the interaction. The GST fusion proteins were also tested for the ability to bind hPLD1 by incubation with hPLD1, followed by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and immunoblot analysis of hPLD1 in precipitate and supernatant fractions (Fig. 9). The ability of GST-AP3 and GST-AP3-(1–320) coupled with the inability of GST-AP3-(321–915), GST-AP3-(1–289), and GST to retain hPLD1 in the precipitate support the notion that the sequence extending from residues Pro-290 to Lys-320 of AP3 is involved in interaction with hPLD1. GST-AP3 partially retained hPLD1 and the ratio of hPLD1 in precipitate and supernatant varied (data not shown). This was probably because the GST-AP3 preparations used in the experiment were proteolyzed, to different extents, to AP3 fragments that were detached from the GST moiety but able to bind hPLD1. AP3 was independently discovered in a variety of contexts and has been termed AP 180 (14Ahle S. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), AP3 (15Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), NP185 (16Kohtz D.S. Puszkin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7418-7425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and F1–20 (9Zhou S. Sousa R. Tannery N.H. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2144-2155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It binds to clathrin triskelia and promotes their assembly into a homogeneous population of 60–70-nm coats (5Prasad K. Lippoldt P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6098-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Ahle S. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Clathrin-coated vesicles are dynamic organelles that participate in intracellular membrane trafficking, including the biogenesis and recycling of synaptic vesicles. In addition to AP3, clathrin-coated vesicles contain one or more other assembly proteins, including AP1, AP2, and auxilin (17Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). AP1 and AP2 are tetramers and widely distributed, whereas AP3 and auxilin are monomers and present only in neuronal cells and tissues. In bovine brain, AP3 is localized predominantly in cytosol, with only ∼30% associated with membranes (19Ungewickell E. Oestergaard L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). AP3 binds IP6 with high affinity (7Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Norris F.A. Ungewickell E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 214-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Like many other inositol polyphosphate-binding proteins, AP3 also binds PI(4,5)P2, as judged from the observation that AP3 associated with lipid vesicles containing PI(4,5)P2 but not with those vesicles lacking PI(4,5)P2. However, the interaction of AP3 with PI (4,5)P2 is of low affinity and was not responsible for inhibition of PLD. Furthermore, at a concentration that maximally inhibits PLD, AP3 had no effect on the PI(4,5)P2-hydrolyzing activities of three PLC isozymes assayed with substrate vesicles of lipid composition identical to that of those used for the PLD assay. This result suggests that the amount of PI(4,5)P2 that is bound to AP3 on the surface of substrate vesicles is negligible and that the inhibition of PLD by AP3 is not due to nonspecific interaction of AP3 with lipid vesicles. AP3 purified from brain and bacterially expressed GST-AP3 were equally potent inhibitors of PLD. In an inhibition assay utilizing a partial trypsin digestion of AP3, the NH2-terminal 33-kDa fragment appeared to inhibit hPLD1 while the NH2-terminal 30-kDa fragment did not. Furthermore, the GST fusion protein comprising the NH2-terminal 320 residues of AP3 was able to inhibit hPLD1, whereas the GST fusion protein comprising the COOH-terminal 595 residues was ineffective. We were able to further localize the inhibitory site to 31 amino acid residues extending from the Pro-290 to Lys-320 of AP3 on the basis of the ability of GST-AP3-(1–320) and the inability of GST-AP3-(1–289) to inhibit hPLD1. Direct binding of AP3 to hPLD1 and the essential role of the 31 residues in the binding were also demonstrated by the fact that GST-AP3 and GST-AP3-(1–320) retain hPLD1 during sedimentation while GST, GST-AP3-(1–289), and GST-AP3-(321–915) do not. However, the AP3 binding does not appear to interfere with the binding of ARF or PC to hPLD1, as indicated by the observation that the inhibition by AP3 was not affected by changes in the concentration of ARF or PC. The predicted primary structure and characterization of the products of limited proteolysis suggest a three-domain organization for AP3: a central 42-kDa domain flanked by 33-kDa NH2-terminal and 16-kDa COOH-terminal domains (6Murphy J.-E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10933-10939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Morris S.A. Schröder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The 33-kDa NH2-terminal domain of AP3 binds to clathrin triskelia but neither promotes the assembly of nor binds to preassembled clathrin cages, whereas the 58-kDa COOH-terminal region (the 42-kDa central domain plus the 16-kDa COOH-terminal domain) binds clathrin, induces assembly of a homogeneous population of clathrin cages in a manner similar to that of the full-length protein, and binds to preassembled clathrin cages (8Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10933-10939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). AP3 also binds IP6 with high affinity through the 33-kDa NH2-terminal domain, and IP6binding inhibits clathrin assembly (7Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Norris F.A. Ungewickell E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 214-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our data show that IP6 binding does not affect inhibition of PLD by AP3. Our data also show that AP3 molecules that are associated with clathrin cages through their 58-kDa COOH-terminal region can inhibit PLD via their 33-kDa NH2-terminal region. AP3 shares no significant sequence similarities with other known clathrin-binding proteins, such as the subunits of AP1 and AP2, or auxilin (9Zhou S. Sousa R. Tannery N.H. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2144-2155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Morris S.A. Schröder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Murphy et al.(11) therefore suggested that AP3 performs an additional cellular function that distinguishes it from other clathrin assembly proteins. Although AP3 is a high affinity receptor for inositol polyphosphates, interaction of the latter with AP2 also modulates its clathrin assembly activity (20Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4442-4447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Voglmaier S.M. Keen J.H. Murphy J.-E. Ferris C.D. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Theibert A.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8976-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PLD might therefore be the additional function that is specific to AP3. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies to AP1 or AP2 suggests that none of the PLD-inhibitory fractions from column chromatography of rat brain proteins contained AP1 or AP2 (data not shown). Although the presence of PLD in synaptic vesicles has not been established, ARF-activated PLD is highly enriched in Golgi membranes (23Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and the production of PA by PLD is a key event in the formation of coatomer-coated vesicles (24Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, increased concentrations of PA and PI(4,5)P2 are sufficient to promote the binding of coatomer to membranes (24Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The generation of PA and that of PI(4,5)P2 are related events; PI(4,5)P2 stimulates PA production by activating PLD, and the PA thus produced enhances the synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 by activating PI(4)P 5-kinase, constituting a positive feedback loop for the generation of these two lipid messenger molecules (25Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15980-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we show that synaptojanin inhibits PLD by hydrolyzing PI(4,5)P2. Synaptojanin is a nerve terminal-specific IPPase and has been implicated in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles (27McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Golgi membranes also contain an IPPase known as OCRL (28Olivos-Glander I.M. Pasi A.J. Nussbaum R.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 57: 817-823Google Scholar), which we showed is capable of inhibiting PLD. We therefore proposed that the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2, and consequent inhibition of PLD, by IPPases such as synaptojanin and OCRL might constitute a common mechanism for interrupting the positive feedback loop during membrane invagination and act as a signal for uncoating (2Chung J.-K. Sekiya F. Kang H.-S. Lee C. Han J.-S. Kim S.R. Bae Y.S. Morris A.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15980-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that direct inhibition of PLD by AP3 without the involvement of PI(4,5)P2 might constitute an additional mechanism to halt the positive feedback loop and to signal uncoating. Because AP3 is a synapse-specific protein (29Perry D.G. Li S. Hanson V. Puszkin S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Sousa R. Tannery N.H. Zhou S. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2130-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such a mechanism would be specific to synaptic vesicles. The synaptic vesicle cycle at the nerve terminal shares many features with membrane trafficking in nonneuronal cells (31Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). However, synaptic transmission requires rapid transitions through each step of the cycle (32Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). For example, the membranes of empty synaptic vesicles are taken up within 1–5 s after exocytosis (33von Gersdorff H. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 370: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which is much faster than most endocytotic events. This special requirement for speed might necessitate the additional, AP3-dependent mechanism for inhibition of PLD. We thank E. M. Lafer for the E. coli strain expressing GST-AP3, Evan Eisenberg and Ruo-Fan Jiang for clathrin, and Rodney Levine and Michael Nauman for peptide sequencing."

M-CSF stimulation of murine myeloid FDC-P1 cells expressing Fms resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of signal transduction proteins, including an unidentified 100-kDa protein. This 100-kDa protein associated with the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 but not with the related phosphatase SHP-1. The kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of p100 and SHP-2 suggest that p100 may be a direct substrate of SHP-2. p100 bound directly to the SH2 domains of both SHP-2 and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. The 100-kDa protein did not appear to bind directly to Fms, Ship, Cbl, Shc, or Grb2, although all of these proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with p85 after M-CSF stimulation. Association of p100 with SHP-2 and p85 did not require the major autophosphorylation sites on Fms nor binding of p85 to Fms. A tyrosine phosphorylated protein of 100 kDa also coprecipitated with SHP-2 from several other myeloid cell lines after M-CSF stimulation but was not seen in immunoprecipitates from Rat2 fibroblasts expressing Fms.

Recent studies on the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 have established the importance of these phosphatases to intracellular signaling in hematopoietic cells.

SHP-1 (previously called SH-PTP1, PTP1C, HCP, and SHP) is expressed at highest levels in hematopoietic cells (3Yi T. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 836-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Mutation of the gene for SHP-1 in mice results in the motheaten phenotype (4Tsui H.W. Siminovitch K.A. de Souza L. Tsui F.W.L.

Tsui H.W. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 138: 185-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consistent with this phenotype, SHP-1 negatively regulates signaling from a variety of cytokine receptors, including the receptors for interleukin-3 (6Yi T. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), erythropoietin (EPO) (7Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F.

The negative effect on signaling results from dephosphorylation of the cytokine receptor itself (6Yi T. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or dephosphorylation of one or more tyrosine phosphorylated proteins associated with the receptor (7Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). For instance, SHP-1 binds to the EPO receptor after EPO stimulation and dephosphorylates the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2. Cells expressing mutant EPO receptors that cannot bind SHP-1 are hypersensitive to EPO and display prolonged autophosphorylation of JAK2 (7Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). In contrast to SHP-1, SHP-2 (previously called SH-PTP2, PTP2C, PTP1D, and Syp) is widely expressed (11Feng G.-S.

The SH2 domains of SHP-2 may allow it to act in part as an adapter linking two or more signaling proteins. For instance, after binding to the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor or EPO-R, SHP-2 is itself tyrosine phosphorylated and binds to the SH2 domains of the adapter protein Grb2. Grb2 is constitutively bound to the Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing factor Sos, and by linking Grb2 and the receptor, SHP-2 effectively recruits Sos to the membrane where it can activate Ras (19Tauchi T.

Grb2 binding to Fms probably results in translocation of Sos to the membrane and subsequent Ras activation (40Lioubin M.N. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Bowtell D. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Cell.

Tyrosine 807 within the kinase catalytic domain of Fms does not bind any known signaling proteins, but is important for c-myc induction in NIH 3T3 cells (50Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Shurtleff S.A.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the roles of SHP-1 and SHP-2 in Fms signaling in FDC-P1 cells. We find that SHP-2 binds to a novel 100-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein after stimulation by M-CSF and several other cytokines. This 100-kDa protein associates directly with the SH2 domains of both SHP-2 and the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3′-kinase and is associated with Fms, Ship, Cbl, Shc, and Grb2 in p85 immune complexes. Recombinant murine M-CSF and WEHI-3B cell conditioned medium (a source of IL-3) were described previously (51Wang Z. Myles G. Brandt C.S. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Cell.

Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and Rat2 cells expressing an exogenous murine Fms gene were generated as described previously (52Carlberg K. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). FDC-P1 cells expressing Fms genes with tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations of the autophosphorylation sites have been described (55Carlberg K. Tapley P. Haystead C. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). FDC-P1, 32D, and EML cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% WEHI-3B cell conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. BAC1.2F5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1000 units/ml of murine M-CSF. Rat2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. Different domains of SHP-2 and p85 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified using oligonucleotides that included either a BamHI (5′ end) or an EcoRI (3′ end) restriction site. The templates for polymerase chain reaction amplification were pGEX-2T-SHP-2 (kindly provided by Zhizhuang Zhao, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) and a p85 cDNA provided by Michael Fry (Institute of Cancer Research, Surrey, UK). For SHP-2, the amplified domains were the N-terminal SH2 domain (amino acids 3–109), the C-terminal SH2 domain (amino acids 97–223), N and C-terminal SH2 domains (amino acids 3–223), full-length SHP-2 (amino acids 3–593), and C terminus (amino acids 543–593). For p85, the domains amplified were the N terminus (amino acids 3–332), N-terminal SH2 domain (amino acids 300–435), C-terminal SH2 domain (amino acids 589–724), and N plus C-terminal SH2 domains (amino acids 300–724). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, gel purified, and ligated into the BamHI, EcoRI-cut plasmid pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Ligated DNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21, and colonies were screened for the correct insert by restriction digest. GST fusion proteins were prepared from BL21 lysates by adsorption to glutathione-agarose as described in the Pharmacia GST Gene Fusion System manual. Cells for immunoprecipitation were collected by centrifugation and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were stimulated with M-CSF at 10,000 units/ml as described in the figure legends and then immediately lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (52Carlberg K. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) containing 10 μm phenylarsine oxide (a phosphatase inhibitor). Antibody and protein A-Sepharose (for rabbit antibodies) or protein G-Sepharose (for mouse or rat antibodies) were added to lysates, and the samples were mixed at 4 °C for 1–4 h. The immune complexes were washed five times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and then proteins were eluted with either 100 mm phenyl phosphate in 100 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, or SDS sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% or 10% reducing SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes on a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Ellard Instrumentation, Ltd., Seattle, WA). The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in Block buffer (52Carlberg K. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for 1–18 h and then incubated 1–4 h with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in Block. The membranes were washed for 1 h with 4–6 changes of Rinse buffer (52Carlberg K. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and then incubated 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 in Block. The membranes were washed again as described above, and proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. p85 was immunoprecipitated from M-CSF-stimulated FDFms cells using a rabbit polyclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (06-195). Five duplicate immunoprecipitates were run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. After incubating the membrane with Block overnight at 4 °C, the membrane was cut into five strips. One strip was immunoblotted with antibody to phosphotyrosine as described above. The other strips were incubated separately for 3 h with GST, GST-SHP1-N+C-SH2s, GST-SHP2-N+C-SH2s, or GST-P85-N+C-SH2s (each at 1 μg/ml in Block). The blots were washed 4 × 10 min in Rinse and then incubated for 1 h with a chicken antiserum recognizing GST (1:10,000 in Block). The blots were washed again 4 × 10 min in Rinse and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken antibody at 1:10,000 in Block. The blots were washed again as above, and signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. To look for a potential role for tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 in Fms signaling in myeloid progenitor cells such as FDC-P1, we initially tried to coimmunoprecipitate these phosphatases with antibody to Fms. Using immunoblots with antibodies specific for SHP-1 or SHP-2, neither phosphatase was found to be associated with Fms after M-CSF stimulation (data not shown). Antibodies to SHP-1 or SHP-2 also failed to coimmunoprecipitate Fms. These results are consistent with those of Yi and Ihle (56Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and Chen et al. (10Chen H. Chang S. Trub T. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3685-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), who reported that SHP-1 does not associate directly with Fms. Although Fms was not present in immunoprecipitates of these phosphatases, a tyrosine phosphorylated protein of about 100 kDa was coimmunoprecipitated with SHP-2 from FDFms cells after M-CSF stimulation (Fig. 1). The 100-kDa protein was by far the most prominent phosphoprotein associated with SHP-2. In contrast, no tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were detected in SHP-1 immunoprecipitates either before or after M-CSF stimulation. Time course experiments were performed to look at the kinetics of p100 phosphorylation and association with SHP-2. FDFms cells were treated with M-CSF for 15 s to 4.5 min, and cell lysates were incubated with an antibody that recognized both SHP-1 and SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatases. A phosphotyrosine blot of the time course experiment showed that p100 was phosphorylated within 15 s and was maximally phosphorylated after 1–1.5 min of M-CSF treatment at 37 °C (Fig.2). After about 1.5 min of M-CSF stimulation, p100 appeared to be rapidly dephosphorylated or at least dissociated from SHP-2 (Fig. 2 A). A phosphotyrosine blot of whole cell lysates showed that p100 was among the first proteins tyrosine phosphorylated after M-CSF stimulation and again decreased in intensity after about 1.5 min (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that p100 was dephosphorylated at this time and not merely dissociated from SHP-2. Interestingly, SHP-2 itself was not tyrosine phosphorylated immediately upon M-CSF stimulation, but was tyrosine phosphorylated after about 1.5 min. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 was not required for its association with p100. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 just preceded dephosphorylation of p100. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 has been shown to activate its phosphatase domain (15Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 20Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this suggests that SHP-2 may directly dephosphorylate p100. In contrast to SHP-2, SHP-1 was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in these cells (Figs. 1 and 2 A), and M-CSF treatment did not increase the level of phosphotyrosine on SHP-1 (Fig. 2). p100 always appeared as a broad band on SDS-PAGE gels, suggesting that it might be a glycoprotein. However, p100 failed to bind to lectin columns (data not shown), so the broad appearance of the p100 band on SDS-PAGE gels is likely caused by some other modification. The p100 protein also gradually increased in apparent molecular mass with time after M-CSF stimulation. After 15 s of M-CSF stimulation at 37 °C, the protein had an apparent molecular mass of about 90 kDa. After 10 min, the apparent molecular mass had increased to about 100 kDa (Fig. 2 A). This increase in molecular mass was not likely due to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, because the level of phosphotyrosine seemed to be decreasing at the same time that the molecular mass of p100 was increasing (Fig. 2 B). The increase in mass could therefore be due to serine or threonine phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or another modification. To determine whether p100 was associated with other proteins known to be involved in Fms signaling, antibodies to Fms, Ship, Cbl, p85, SHP-2, Shc, or Grb2 were used to immunopreci"
https://openalex.org/W2075430707,"A rat liver nuclear protein, unimolecular quadruplex telomere-binding protein 25, (uqTBP25) is described that binds tightly and specifically single-stranded and unimolecular tetraplex forms of the vertebrate telomeric DNA sequence 5′-d(TTAGGG) n -3′. A near homogeneous uqTBP25 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatographic separation from other DNA binding proteins, and three steps of column chromatography. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Superdex© 200 gel filtration disclosed for uqTBP25 subunit and nativeM r values of 25.4 ± 0.5 and 25.0 kDa, respectively. Sequences of uqTBP25 tryptic peptides were closely homologous, but not identical, to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1, and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins UP1 and HDP-1. Complexes of uqTBP25 with single-stranded or unimolecular quadruplex 5′-d(TTAGGG)4-3′, respectively, had dissociation constants,K d, of 2.2 or 13.4 nm. Relative to d(TTAGGG)4, complexes with 5′-r(UUAGGG)4-3′, blunt-ended duplex telomeric DNA, or quadruplex telomeric DNA had >10 to >250-fold higher K d values. Single base alterations within the d(TTAGGG) repeat increased theK d of complexes with uqTBP25 by 9–215-fold. Association with uqTBP25 protected d(TTAGGG)4 against nuclease digestion, suggesting a potential role for the protein in telomeric DNA transactions. A rat liver nuclear protein, unimolecular quadruplex telomere-binding protein 25, (uqTBP25) is described that binds tightly and specifically single-stranded and unimolecular tetraplex forms of the vertebrate telomeric DNA sequence 5′-d(TTAGGG) n -3′. A near homogeneous uqTBP25 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatographic separation from other DNA binding proteins, and three steps of column chromatography. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Superdex© 200 gel filtration disclosed for uqTBP25 subunit and nativeM r values of 25.4 ± 0.5 and 25.0 kDa, respectively. Sequences of uqTBP25 tryptic peptides were closely homologous, but not identical, to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1, and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins UP1 and HDP-1. Complexes of uqTBP25 with single-stranded or unimolecular quadruplex 5′-d(TTAGGG)4-3′, respectively, had dissociation constants,K d, of 2.2 or 13.4 nm. Relative to d(TTAGGG)4, complexes with 5′-r(UUAGGG)4-3′, blunt-ended duplex telomeric DNA, or quadruplex telomeric DNA had >10 to >250-fold higher K d values. Single base alterations within the d(TTAGGG) repeat increased theK d of complexes with uqTBP25 by 9–215-fold. Association with uqTBP25 protected d(TTAGGG)4 against nuclease digestion, suggesting a potential role for the protein in telomeric DNA transactions. Linear eukaryotic chromosomes end with a specialized DNA-protein structure termed the telomere that guards the chromosome terminus against degradative attack or fusion with ends of other chromosomes (1Blackburn E.H.

Telomeric DNA consists of evolutionarily conserved short, tandemly repeated nucleotide sequences. The telomeric DNA strand, oriented 5′ to 3′ toward the chromosome end (“G-strand”) in all vertebrates, slime molds, filamentous fungi, andTrypanosoma, is a repeated 5′-d(TTAGGG)-3′ sequence paired to a complementary 5′-d(CCCTAA)-3′ strand. At their 3′-end, vertebrate telomeres terminate with a 12–16-nucleotide-long unpaired overhang of the G-strand (1Blackburn E.H.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 11-34Google Scholar).The telomere hypothesis of cellular aging and tumorigenesis claims that progressive shortening of telomeres during the life span of somatic cells leads to the cessation of cell division and to cellular senescence (15Harley C.B. Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring, NY1995: 247-264Google Scholar). In contrast, by maintaining a stable length of either long or short telomeres, respectively, germ line cells and tumor cells avoid division cycle exit and continue to divide infinitely (15Harley C.B. Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring, NY1995: 247-264Google Scholar). This hypothesis is sustained by data showing that whereas telomeric DNA is progressively trimmed in the course of the aging of diverse somatic cells, its length persists in immortal germ line and cancer cells (Refs. 16Hastie N.D.

The progressive shortening of telomeres in somatic cells and the contrasting maintenance of their length in indefinitely dividing cells is partly accounted for by their different levels of activity of telomerase, the telomeric G-strand-extending enzyme. Whereas telomerase activity is undetectable in numerous somatic tissues and in dividing primary cells, many cancer cells retain an active enzyme (Refs. 17Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Brasiskyte D.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 265-293Google Scholar). That telomerase does not exclusively determine telomere length is inferred, however, by the observation that some tumor cells whose telomere length remains stable have no measurable telomerase activity (24Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), and conversely, an active telomerase is detected in normal bone marrow cells and blood cells (25Broccoli D. Young J.W. De Lange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9082-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Further, the loss of 50–200-nucleotide-long segments of telomeric DNA with each round of replication of somatic cells (26Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W.

Genet. 1993; 52: 661-669PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that exonucleolytic degradation of the terminus of telomeric DNA may also contribute to its progressive trimming. It has been suggested, therefore, that telomeric DNA binding proteins that were identified in diverse species may participate in the complex dynamics of elongation and shortening of telomeric DNA (4Lundblad V.

A partial amino acid sequence of uqTBP25 is closely homologous but not identical with sequences of hnRNP 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; MalNEt, N-ethylmaleimide; TEMED,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; MalNEt, N-ethylmaleimide; TEMED,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A1 and hnRNP A2/B1 and their respective derivative single-stranded DNA-binding proteins UP1 and HDP-1. Protein uqTBP25 is distinguished from hnRNP A1 and A2/B1 by its molecular size, preferential binding to DNA over RNA, and sequence-specific binding to the telomeric DNA G-strand. This protein also differs from UP1 and HDP-1 by its selective binding to the G-strand of telomeric DNA and by its failure to significantly stimulate the activity of DNA polymerase α.DISCUSSIONThe new mammalian telomeric DNA binding protein uqTBP25, which we describe in this manuscript, associates tightly and in a sequence-specific manner with single-stranded and unimolecular tetraplex forms of the G-strand of vertebrate telomeric DNA. Two or more d(TTAGGG) telomeric DNA repeat units suffice for the formation of uqTBP25-DNA complexes that display nanomolar range dissociation constants (Table VI). Various single-stranded sequences, including DNA oligomers that do or do not contain guanine clusters as well as RNA sequences, fail to efficiently compete at a 50- or 75-fold molar excess with TeR-2 DNA for complex formation with uqTBP25 (Table V). The specific binding of vertebrate telomeric DNA by uqTBP25 is further underscored by the greatly reduced affinity of the protein for the DNA ligand when a single base substitution is introduced into the telomeric G-strand sequence. Thus, K d values of complexes of uqTBP25 with d(TTGGGG)4, d(TTAGAG)4 or d(TAAGGG)4 are 215-, 85-, or 9-fold higher, respectively, than the K d of a complex with d(TTAGGG)4 (Table VI).The amino acid sequence of five tryptic peptides of uqTBP25 (Table IV) are closely homologous, but not identical, to sequences shared by hnRNP A1 (56Buvoli M.

Notably, a sequence within uqTBP25 peptide I (Table IV), IFVGGI, corresponds to the consensus sequence of the RNP2 element, LFVGNL, which is common to hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2/B1, UP1, and HDP-1 (67Weighardt F. Biamonti G. Riva S. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, despite their close sequence similarity, uqTBP25 is disparate from hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2/B1, UP1, and HDP-1.uqTBP25 Is Distinct from hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2/B1Four lines of evidence distinguish uqTBP25 from hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2/B1. (i) The 25-kDa molecular mass of uqTBP25 (Fig. 2 and “Results”) differs from the 34- and 36–38-kDa molecular sizes of hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2/B1, respectively (68Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Piñol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). (ii) Out of 43 sequenced amino acid residues in uqTBP25, 4 or 6, respectively, are different from corresponding residues in hnRNP A1 or A2/B1 (Table IV). The amino acid sequence of hnRNP A1 is 100% conserved in human, bovine, mouse, and rat cells (Ref. 68Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Piñol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, Table IV). The finding of different amino acids at matching positions in the rat cell-derived uqTBP25 and in the highly conserved hnRNP A1 (Table IV) indicates, therefore, that uqTBP25 does not represent rat hnRNP A1 or a derivative thereof. The six-residue difference between the amino acid sequences of rat uqTBP25 and human hnRNP A2/B1 (Table IV) strongly suggest that these two proteins are the products of distinct genes. Notably, a 100% identity exists between a partial sequence of mouse hnRNP A2/B1 and its human homologue (69McKay S.J. Cooke H.J. Nucl. Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is thus unlikely that the different amino acid sequences of uqTBP25 and of hnRNP A2/B1 are due to species diversity among homologous proteins. (iii) No detectable complex is formed between uqTBP25 and yeast total RNA (Table V; see “Results”), and a complex that does form between uqTBP25 and r(UUAGGG)4 has a K d value 11.6-fold higher than that of a complex with d(TTAGGG)4(Table VI). The propensity of uqTBP25 for binding single-stranded DNA over RNA contrasts the preference of hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2/B1 for association with RNA over single-stranded DNA (64Kumar A. Williams K.R. Szer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11266-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iv) Data presented in Tables V and VI show that uqTBP25 binds d(TTAGGG) n sequences with a high degree of sequence specificity. By contrast, evidence shows that hnRNP A1 and A2/B1 bind RNA with a low sequence specificity (70Schenkel J. Sekeris C.E. Alonso A. Bautz E.K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), with a notable exception of a reported selective binding of d(TTAGGG) n by mouse liver hnRNP A2/B1 (69McKay S.J. Cooke H.J. Nucl. Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).uqTBP25 Is Distinct from the Single-stranded Binding Proteins UP1 and HDP-1Four lines of evidence indicate that despite their close size and sequence similarity, uqTBP25 and UP1 or HDP-1 are distinct proteins. (i) The amino acid sequence of the single-stranded DNA binding proteins UP1 from calf thymus and HDP-1 from mouse myeloma (51Herrick G. Delius H. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2142-2146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that they are fully homologous to the amino-terminal portion of HnRNP A1 and HnRNP A2/B1, respectively (58Williams K.R. Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Merril B.M. Planck S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5666-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 64Kumar A. Williams K.R. Szer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11266-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple amino acid substitutions distinguish uqTBP25 from either UP1 or HDP-1 and from their respective progenitor proteins HnRNP A1 or A2/B1 (TableIV). Hence, it appears that uqTBP25 is not a product of proteolytic cleavage of either HnRNP A1 or A2/B1 as are UP1 or HDP-1, respectively. (ii) The 25-kDa size of uqTBP25 differs from the 22- and 27-kDa molecular masses of calf thymus UP1 (58Williams K.R. Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Merril B.M. Planck S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5666-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and mouse myeloma HDP-1 (65Planck S.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11547-11556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. (iii) Whereas UP1 or HDP-1 bind single-stranded DNA with little or no sequence preference (51Herrick G. Delius H. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2142-2146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 65Planck S.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11547-11556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), uqTBP25 associates selectively with the telomeric sequence d(TTAGGG) n (Tables Vand VI). (iv) Unlike UP1, which stimulates >5- or >10-fold the copying by DNA polymerase α of poly(dC) or of single-stranded DNA templates, respectively (51Herrick G. Delius H. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2142-2146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), uqTBP25 slightly inhibits copying of poly(dC) and increases by less than 2-fold copying of single-stranded DNA (Fig. 5).uqTBP25 Is Possibly Related to a Human Cell Telomeric DNA-binding ProteinA group of related proteins that bind the pre-mRNA 3′ splice site r(UUAG/G) as well as the telomeric sequence d(TTAGGG) n was identified in HeLa cells (71Ishikawa F. Matunis M. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The size, antigenicity, nucleic acid binding preference, and partial amino sequence of most of these proteins suggested that they are identical or closely related to hnRNP type A2/B1, D, or E (71Ishikawa F. Matunis M. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, a 26-kDa protein designated A26, which has stretches 18 amino acids long homologous to hnRNP A1, binds d(TTAGGG) n with a high sequence specificity. Resemblance between human A26 and rat uqTBP25 extends to their similar molecular mass, their preferential binding of single-stranded over blunt-ended double-stranded telomeric sequence, and their high sequence specificity of d(TTAGGG) n binding (71Ishikawa F. Matunis M. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Yet, some properties distinguish uqTBP25 from A26. Whereas binding competition results indicate that A26 binds r(UUAGGG) n more tightly than d(TTAGGG) n (71Ishikawa F. Matunis M. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the uqTBP25-d(TTAGGG)4 complex has an 11.6-fold lowerK d than a uqTBP25-r(UUAGGG)4 complex (Table VI). Additionally, unlike uqTBP25, which binds TeR-4 and TeR-2 DNA with a similar affinity (Table VI), A26 binds TeR-2 DNA less tightly than TeR-4 DNA (71Ishikawa F. Matunis M. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Last, A26 fails to bind the substituted homologues of r(UUAGGG)4(r(CUAGGG)4, r(UCAGGG)4, r(UUGGGG)4, or r(UUAAGG)4), but it does bind r(UUAGAG)4 or r(UUAGGA)4 (71Ishikawa F. Matunis M. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). By contrast, relative to d(TTAGAG)4, uqTBP25 binds most weakly d(TTGGGG)4 and d(TTAGAG)4, but it does associate relatively tightly with d(TAAGGG)4 (Table VI).Potential Cellular Function of uqTBP25The amino acid sequence of uqTBP25 indicates that it is probably a derivative of an hnRNP species that is closely related but not identical to hnRNP A1 or A2/B1 (Table VI). Likewise, uqTBP25 is related to but distinct from the single-stranded DNA-binding proteins UP1 and HDP-1. Based on its molecular size and telomeric DNA binding specificity, uqTBP25 is most closely similar to human protein A26 (71Ishikawa F. Matunis M. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It was argued that the prime target of protein A26 is the pre-mRNA splice site but that it could also be involved in the binding of telomeric DNA (71Ishikawa F. Matunis M. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In view of the preferential binding by uqTBP25 of telomeric DNA sequence over its RNA homologue and its lack of clear preference for an intact splice site (Table VI), it might be that this protein interacts primarily with the G-strand of telomeric DNA rather than with pre-mRNA. By binding the telomeric G-strand overhang, uqTBP25 may protect it against nucleolytic attack (Fig. 4). Additionally, uqTBP25 might be instrumental in the stabilization of specific structures of telomeric DNA. Hence, by binding tightly single-stranded or unimolecular tetraplex forms of d(TTAGGG) n while binding weakly its bimolecular or tetramolecular tetraplex forms, uqTBP25 may stabilize the monomolecular forms of the G-strand overhang and prevent the generation of multimolecular tetraplex structures. Linear eukaryotic chromosomes end with a specialized DNA-protein structure termed the telomere that guards the chromosome terminus against degradative attack or fusion with ends of other chromosomes (1Blackburn E.H.

Telomeric DNA consists of evolutionarily conserved short, tandemly repeated nucleotide sequences. The telomeric DNA strand, oriented 5′ to 3′ toward the chromosome end (“G-strand”) in all vertebrates, slime molds, filamentous fungi, andTrypanosoma, is a repeated 5′-d(TTAGGG)-3′ sequence paired to a complementary 5′-d(CCCTAA)-3′ strand. At their 3′-end, vertebrate telomeres terminate with a 12–16-nucleotide-long unpaired overhang of the G-strand (1Blackburn E.H.

https://openalex.org/W2102970512,"Antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) has the potential of greatly enhancing antitumor selectivity of cancer therapy by synthesizing chemotherapeutic agents selectively at tumor sites. This therapy is based upon targeting a prodrug-activating enzyme to a tumor by attaching the enzyme to a tumor-selective antibody and dosing the enzyme-antibody conjugate systemically. After the enzyme-antibody conjugate is localized to the tumor, the prodrug is then also dosed systemically, and the previously targeted enzyme converts it to the active drug selectively at the tumor. Unfortunately, most enzymes capable of this specific, tumor site generation of drugs are foreign to the human body and as such are expected to raise an immune response when injected, which will limit their repeated administration. We reasoned that with the power of crystallography, molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, this problem could be addressed through the development of a human enzyme that is capable of catalyzing a reaction that is otherwise not carried out in the human body. This would then allow use of prodrugs that are otherwise stablein vivo but that are substrates for a tumor-targeted mutant human enzyme. We report here the first test of this concept using the human enzyme carboxypeptidase A1 (hCPA1) and prodrugs of methotrexate (MTX). Based upon a computer model of the human enzyme built from the well known crystal structure of bovine carboxypeptidase A, we have designed and synthesized novel bulky phenylalanine- and tyrosine-based prodrugs of MTX that are metabolically stable in vivo and are not substrates for wild type human carboxypeptidases A. Two of these analogs are MTX-α-3-cyclobutylphenylalanine and MTX-α-3-cyclopentyltyrosine. Also based upon the computer model, we have designed and produced a mutant of human carboxypeptidase A1, changed at position 268 from the wild type threonine to a glycine (hCPA1-T268G). This novel enzyme is capable of using the in vivo stable prodrugs, which are not substrates for the wild type hCPA1, as efficiently as the wild type hCPA1 uses its best substrates (i.e. MTX-α-phenylalanine). Thus, thek cat/K m value for the wild type hCPA1 with MTX-α-phenylalanine is 0.44 μm−1 s−1, andk cat/K m values for hCPA1-T268G with MTX-α-3-cyclobutylphenylalanine and MTX-α-3-cyclopentyltyrosine are 1.8 and 0.16 μm−1 s−1, respectively. The cytotoxic efficiency of hCPA1–268G was tested in an in vitro ADEPT model. For this experiment, hCPA1-T268G was chemically conjugated to ING-1, an antibody that binds to the tumor antigen Ep-Cam, or to Campath-1H, an antibody that binds to the T and B cell antigen CDw52. These conjugates were then incubated with HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells (which express Ep-Cam but not the Campath 1H antigen) followed by incubation of the cells with thein vivo stable prodrugs. The results showed that the targeted ING-1:hCPA1-T268G conjugate produced excellent activation of the MTX prodrugs to kill HT-29 cells as efficiently as MTX itself. By contrast, the enzyme-Campath 1H conjugate was without effect. These data strongly support the feasibility of ADEPT using a mutated human enzyme with a single amino acid change.

A current major challenge to cancer therapy is to increase antitumor selectivity. One approach to realizing this goal is to use the exquisite selectivity of the antibody:antigen reaction to target therapeutic entities specifically to tumors. While absolutely tumor-specific antibodies are not known, many antibodies are available that can deliver tumor-selective targeting (for review, see Ref.1Sell S. Reisfeld R.A. Monoclonal Antibodies in Cancer. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1985Crossref Google Scholar).One investigational therapy that makes use of this principle of antibody targeting is antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT). 1The abbreviations used are: ADEPT, antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy; CPA, carboxypeptidase; hCPA, human CPA; bCPA, bovine CPA; MTX, methotrexate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; WT, wild type; Sulfo-SMCC, sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate. 1The abbreviations used are: ADEPT, antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy; CPA, carboxypeptidase; hCPA, human CPA; bCPA, bovine CPA; MTX, methotrexate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; WT, wild type; Sulfo-SMCC, sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate. ADEPT is a powerful strategy with the potential for tumor-specific long-term delivery of chemotherapy (2Bagshawe K.D. Br. J.

The premise of ADEPT is to target an enzyme of interest specifically to tumor cells by coupling it to a tumor-specific antibody. This conjugate is delivered to the patient systemically and then allowed to bind to the antigen-expressing target cells. Unbound conjugate is allowed to clear from circulation, and when the circulating levels of conjugate are sufficiently low, a prodrug is administered, also systemically, that can be converted to a toxic chemotherapeutic drug by the targeted enzyme-antibody conjugate. The action of the enzyme-antibody conjugate on the prodrug then ideally generates lethal levels of drug specifically at the tumor site. For this therapy to be selective, however, nonspecific activation of the prodrug at sites distant to the tumor must be minimized. This is generally accomplished by using a conjugate enzyme with an activity not endogenous to the host or at least not accessible to the prodrug (2Bagshawe K.D. Br. J.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2151-2159PubMed Google Scholar).An inherent problem with antibody-targeted therapies is the immune response mounted by the host to the foreign proteins and other antigens used in the therapy (1Sell S. Reisfeld R.A. Monoclonal Antibodies in Cancer. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1985Crossref Google Scholar, 28Sharma S.K. Bagshawe K.D. Melton R.G. Sherwood R.F. Cell Biophys. 1992; 21: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For example, monoclonal antibodies used in antibody targeting-based therapies are in general rodent in origin and as such recognized by the immune system (1Sell S. Reisfeld R.A. Monoclonal Antibodies in Cancer. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1985Crossref Google Scholar, 28Sharma S.K. Bagshawe K.D. Melton R.G. Sherwood R.F. Cell Biophys. 1992; 21: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ADEPT has the additional problem that the enzyme used to generate the site-specific drug synthesis can also be immunogenic, especially when a foreign enzyme is used. The immunogenicity associated with these foreign antibody or enzyme proteins decreases the utility of the antibody-targeting strategies by decreasing the ability of the physician to perform multiple dosing regimens.Attempts are being made to overcome the immune response to the rodent antibodies through “humanization” of the antibodies (30Reichmann L. Clark M. Waldmann H. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). In this strategy, much of the sequence of the mouse monoclonal antibody is replaced with corresponding human antibody sequence. Only selected residues at the antigen combining site are left intact, leaving relatively few “rodent residues” remaining in the antibody.We reasoned that the imunogenicity associated with the use of enzymes of nonhuman origin might be circumvented through a similar strategy. However, we chose not to precisely follow the strategy of antibody humanization, which commences the process with the binding site of a foreign protein. Rather, our approach to generate a composite human/nonhuman enzyme was to start with a fully human enzyme and change the “active site” at one or two residues to produce a >99.5% human enzyme capable of efficiently performing a non-human reaction. This human enzyme with non-human specificity, along with humanized antibodies, should then facilitate the production of enzyme:antibody conjugates having lower immunogenicity and benefit the development of multiple dosing regimen ADEPT strategies.Our initial target to generate a human enzyme with non-human specificity was human pancreatic carboxypeptidase A, recently cloned and expressed in our laboratory (31Laethem R.M.

Pancreatic carboxypeptidase A is a zinc-containing exopeptidase released into the small intestine from the pancreas as a zymogen (32Christianson D.W. Lipscomb W.N. Acc. Chem.

The first gene in the operon, arsR, was previously shown to encode a homodimeric trans-acting metalloregulatory repressor protein. Dimerization of ArsR was investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system in which the ArsR protein was fused to theSaccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 activation domain to produce chimeric proteins. Transcriptional activation of lacZ reporter indicated that dimerization of the ArsR is stable in yeast. The results indicated that residues 1–8 and 90–117 are not required for ArsR dimerization. The genes for a series of truncated ArsR proteins containing six histidine tags were constructed and the proteins purified. The mass of each recombinant protein, as determined by size exclusion chromatography, was consistent with the results from two-hybrid analysis. The results of β-galactosidase assays in vivo and gel mobility shift assays in vitro showed that dimers retained the ability to bind to the ars promoter and to respond to inducer, whereas monomeric ArsRs did neither. These results suggest that a core sequence of about 80 residues has all of the information necessary for dimerization, repression, and metal recognition.

The Escherichia coli chromosomal ars operon confers low level resistance to arsenicals and antimonials (1Carlin A. Shi W.P. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The product of the first gene of the operon, the 117-residue ArsR protein, has been shown to be a trans-acting repressor that senses environmental As(III) and Sb(III) (2Xu C. Shi W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This 13-kDa protein belongs to the ArsR family of metalloregulatory proteins that respond to a variety of metals including As(III), Sb(III), Cd(II), and Zn(II) (3Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have postulated that members of the ArsR family of repressor proteins should have at least three domains, a metal binding domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization domain (4Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Shi W.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ArsR sequence ELC32VC34DL has been proposed to form a portion of the metal binding domain, and a putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif from residues 38 to 54 has been identified in ArsR (3Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to identify regions of ArsR required for dimerization. Numerous studies have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze protein-protein interaction (5Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar, 6Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The assay is based on the coexpression of two fusion proteins, each containing a protein or protein region fused to a domain of the GAL4 transcription factor. Through protein-protein interactions, the GAL4 DNA-binding and GAL4 activation domains are brought together to regulate expression of a reporter lacZ gene. The results of deletion analysis of thearsR gene using the yeast two-hybrid system show that the amino-terminal 8 residues and carboxyl-terminal 28 residues are not required for dimerization of ArsR. These results were confirmedin vitro by size exclusion chromatography of each purified truncated ArsR. In addition, only arsR genes that produced proteins capable of dimerization exhibited metalloregulation in vivo and only ArsRs that could dimerize bound to DNAin vitro. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in TableI. E. coli cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (80 μg/ml), tetracycline (15 μg/ml), or chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) were added as required. For protein expression 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used as inducer. Sodium arsenite or phenylarsine oxide were added at the indicated concentrations.

U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (52667) Google Scholar) using an ALFexpress system and a Cy5 labeled sequence kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Cells of yeast strain SFY526 were grown in YPD or the appropriate selective minimal medium. Competent cells were prepared and transformed as described (12Becker D.M. Guarents L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Portions of the transformation mixture were spread on selective plates, after which the plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days. Yeast expression vectors pGBT9 containing the DNA-binding domain of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 protein and pGAD424 with the GAL4 activation domain were from MATCHMAKER Two-hybrid System (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Full-lengtharsR was cloned in-frame in both pGBT9 and pGAD424 vectors by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviation used is: PCR, polymerase chain reaction. mutagenesis using primers P2 and P13 (Table II) to place an EcoRI site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end of arsR, producing plasmids pGBT9-R and pGAD424-R. Before cloning into pGBT9 and pGAD424 vectors, the PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Progema), and the absence of random mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. The same methodology was applied for all subsequent PCR cloning. Deletion mutants producing carboxyl-terminal truncations were constructed by PCR cloningEcoRI/BamHI fragments using oligonucleotide P2 as a forward primer for all mutants and the following oligonucleotides as reverse primer: P5 for pGAD424-RΔ62–117, P6 for pGAD424-RΔ81–117, P7 for pGAD424-RΔ84–117, P8 for pGAD424-RΔ86–117, P9 for pGAD424-RΔ88–117, P10 for pGAD424-RΔ90–117, and P11 for pGAD424-RΔ94–117. Plasmids pGAD424-RΔ1–40 and pGAD424-RΔ1–11 containing amino-terminal deletion mutants were generated by cloningEcoRI/BamHI fragments from PCR using either oligonucleotide P3 (for deletion of 1–11 amino acid residues) or P4 (for deletion of 1–40 amino acid residues) as forward primer and oligonucleotide P13 as reverse primer. In the case of deletion of residues 1–8, an MunI/BamHI DNA fragment from plasmid pGAD424-R was cloned into vector plasmid pGAD424 that had been digested with EcoRI and BamHI, generating plasmid pGAD424-RΔ1–8.Table IIOligonucleotide primersNameSequence (5′–3′)2-aUnderlined nucleotides are changes from the wild type sequence to introduce the indicated restriction sites.Location in arsR geneRestriction siteP1ATCAGGAGCGCCATATGTC−14 to +5NdeIP2GAATTCGAGCGCAATATGTCAT−15 to +7EcoRIP3GAATTCTTGCTGATGAAACC+32 to +51EcoRIP4GAATTCGACCAGTCGCAGCCCAAG+115 to +138EcoRIP5CGGGATCCAGCAATAGCCCGCComplementary to +170 to +190BamHIP6GGATCCATGCTGGAATATGCGComplementary to +224 to +244BamHIP7GGATCCTTTCGCCGCCCATGCTGGComplementary to +232 to +255BamHIP8GGATCCATAATTTTCGCCGCCCATGComplementary to +236 to +260BamHIP9GGATCCTCATCAATAATTTTCGCComplementary to +244 to +265BamHIP10CAAGCTTACCAGGCCTCATCAATComplementary to +253 to +275HindIIIP11CGGGATCCTGTTCACATCGCCAGComplementary to +264 to +286BamHIP12GGATCCCATGCTGGAATATGCGComplementary to +224 to +245BamHIP13GGATCCCGGATAAAACACATCEnd of arsRgeneBamHI2-a Underlined nucleotides are changes from the wild type sequence to introduce the indicated restriction sites. Open table in a new tab Protein-protein interaction was analyzed by in vivomeasurement of β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay (12Becker D.M. Guarents L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The yeast reporter strain SFY526 was grown on YPD medium or SD synthetic medium containing adenine hemisulfate and all required amino acids. To select for transformants containing pGBT9-derived plasmids, tryptophan was left out of SD medium. To select for transformants containing pGAD424-derived plasmids, leucine was left out of SD medium. Colonies were transferred to sterile Whatman No. 1 filters presoaked in 2 ml of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) (13Miller J. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 0.8 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside, permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and placed onto a sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper that had been soaked in the same 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside containing medium at 30 °C. Positive colonies appeared within 10 h. Plasmids pVA3, encoding a murine p53/GAL4 DNA-binding domain hybrid, and pTD1, expressing an SV40 large T-antigen/GAL4 activation domain hybrid, were used as positive controls. The vectors alone (pGBT9 and pGAD424) were used as negative controls. Vector plasmids pET28a and pET28b (Novagen) were used to construct recombinant plasmids for expression of arsR deletions and genes with six histidine codon tags (His6-tag). Plasmid pETR, encoding His6-tagged wild type ArsR, was generated by ligation of an NdeI fragment from the plasmid pCR0 (2Xu C. Shi W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) into the NdeI site of vector plasmid pET28a. The orientation of arsR was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion. Except for construction of plasmid pETRN9, all arsR deletion mutants were produced by PCR mutagenesis, with several steps of subcloning through vectors pGEM-T and pT7-7 to achieve in-frame fusions. The correct reading frames were verified by DNA sequencing. For deletion genes encoding carboxyl-terminal truncations, the forward primer was the oligonucleotide P1, in which an NdeI site was introduced by altering A to C, and the reverse primers were P12 (for deletion of arsR codons 81–117), P8 (for deletion of codons 86–117), P10 (for deletion of codons 90–117), and P11 (for deletion of codons 94–117). The four final PCR products were cloned into vector pET28b to generate plasmids pETRC80, pETRC85, pETRN89, and pETRC93. Plasmid pETRN41, expressing amino-terminal ArsR truncation of residues 1–40, was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment produced using oligonucleotide P4 as the forward primer and P13 as the reverse primer into vector pET28a. For the deletion of arsR codons 1–8, an MunI-HindIII fragment from plasmid pGAD424-R was cloned into vector pET28b that was digested withEcoRI and HindIII, generating plasmid pETRN9. Cells of E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) bearing pETR series plasmids were grown overnight in LB medium containing kanamycin at 37 °C. The culture was diluted to 100-fold with fresh, prewarmed medium and grown at 37 °C. When the culture reached anA 600 of 0.8, expression of arsR genes was induced by addition of 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for an additional 3 h. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The pelleted cells were suspended in 5 ml of buffer A per g of wet cells and disrupted by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and membranes were removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a 1.2-cm diameter column filled to 8 cm with ProBond resin (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A, followed by 6 volumes of buffer A containing 60 mm imidazole and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m imidazole in buffer A. Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the His6-tagged ArsRs were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −70 °C until use. The mass of purified wild type and truncated His6-tagged ArsRs was determined using a Waters high pressure liquid chromatograph equipped with Synchropak size exclusion column (SynChrom, Inc.) and a precolumn. Proteins were eluted at 1 ml/min with degassed buffer B (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mKAc, and 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Bovine serum albumin (64 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and trypsin inhibitor (17 kDa) were used as standards. Gel mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (15Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing thears operator/promoter was produced by PCR. The purified PCR product was digested with EcoRI to produce a 153-base pair fragment. The DNA was labeled with [α-32P]ATP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and purified using a Wizard DNA clean-up kit (Promega). The lacZreporter plasmid pGBDΔR2 was constructed to monitor the regulatory properties of arsR genes. AnEcoRI-HindIII fragment from plasmid pGBDΔR1 (16Shi W. Dong J. Scott R.A. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9291-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and ligated into plasmid pACYC184 that had been digested withEcoRI and PvuII, generating plasmid pGBDΔR2. Overnight cultures of E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) harboring both pGBDΔR2 and pETR series plasmids were diluted 50-fold into 3 ml of fresh LB medium containing 80 μg/ml kanamycin and 15 μg/ml tetracycline. After 2 h of shaking at 37 °C, cells were induced with 50 μm sodium arsenite and grown for another 2 h. After centrifugation of 1 ml of cell culture, the pellet cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of Z buffer, following which the cells were permeabilized by adding 30 μl of 0.1% SDS and 50 μl of chloroform, with vortexing for 30 s. The reaction mixture contained 50 μl of cell extract, 0.1 ml of 8 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 0.85 ml of Z buffer. β-Galactosidase activity was estimated from the release of nitrophenol at 420 nm at 37 °C and was expressed in Miller units (13Miller J. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Intersubunit interactions were investigated using the yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interaction assay. When yeast reporter strain SFY526 was cotransformed with pGBT9-R (arsR cloned in-frame and carboxyl-terminal to the S. cerevisiae GAL4 DNA-binding domain) and vector plasmid pGAD424 or with vector plasmid pGBT9 and pGAD424-R (arsR cloned in-frame and carboxyl-terminal to the GAL4 activation domain), the colonies were white. However, when the plasmids pGBT9-R and pGAD424-R were coexpressed, blue colonies expressing lacZ were observed (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that dimerization of ArsR is detectable with the yeast two-hybrid system. The products of deletions of arsR from the 5′ or 3′ ends were examined for their ability to interact with a wild typearsR gene product (Fig. 1). All of the deletions were fused to the 3′ end of the sequence for the GAL4 activation domain in the vector plasmid pGAD424. Plasmid pGAD424-RΔ90–117, with deletion of codons 90–117, and plasmid pGAD424-RΔ94–117, with deletion of codons 94–117, each produced blue colonies. However, deletion of an additional two codons (pGAD424-RΔ88–117) abolished β-galactosidase activity, as did further deletions to codons 85, 83, 80, or 61 (Fig.1). Deletion from the 5′ end of the gene were analyzed. Deletion of codons 1–11 (pGAD424-RΔ1–11) or 1–40 (pGAD424-RΔ1–40) also prevented transcriptional activation of lacZ. In contrast, deletion of only the first eight codons (pGAD424-RΔ1–8) resulted inlacZ expression when cotransformed with pGBT9-R (Fig. 1). These results suggest that amino-terminal residues 1–8 and carboxyl-terminal residues 90–117 of ArsR are not required for dimerization. The wild typearsR gene and six deletion mutants were cloned into plasmids pET28a or pET28b (Novagen). The resulting gene products, ArsRH6, RN9H6, RN41H6, and RN89H6, contained the His6 tag at their amino terminus, whereas RC80H6, RC85H6, and RC93H6 contained the His6 tag at their carboxyl terminus. The proteins were produced by expression of the genes in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and each protein was purified to greater than 90% homogeneity by chromatography on Ni-NTA columns. The mass of each protein was determined by size exclusion chromatography. The apparent mass of ArsRH6, RN9H6, RN89H6, or RC93H6 was consistent with the predicted mass of the dimer for each (Table III). In contrast, the elution positions of RN41H6, RC80H6, or RC85H6 were consistent with the mass of a monomer.Table IIIDetermination of apparent aggregation state of ArsRs by size exclusion chromatographyProteinPredicted massApparent massAggregation statekDakDaArsRH615.534DimerRN9H615.633DimerRN41H612.414MonomerRC80H611.614MonomerRC85H612.214MonomerRN89H612.324DimerRC93H613.125Dimer Open table in a new tab To investigate the relationship between dimerization and function of ArsR, the repressive and metalloregulatory activities of arsR and deletion mutants were assayed in vivo using lacZgene expression as a reporter. Eight plasmids, pETR, pETRN9, pETRN12, pETRN41, pETRC80, pETRC85, pETRN89, and pETRC93, were individually cotransformed with plasmid pBGDΔR2, in which transcription of thelacZ gene was under control of the up-stream arspromoter, into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in cells harboring both plasmids (Fig.2). Expression of the gene for His6-tagged ArsR repressed lacZ expression in the absence of inducer and induced in the presence of sodium arsenite. The metalloregulatory activities of the genes encoding RN9H6, RN89H6, and RC93H6 were similar to that of the wild type, although basal lacZ expression was somewhat higher. In contrast, lacZ expression in cells with the deletion mutants encoding RN41H6, RC80H6, and RC85H6 was constitutive. Because RN41H6, RC80H6, and RC85H6 are monomers and RN9H6, RN89H6, and RC93H6 are dimers, these results suggest that dimerization is essential for the repressive and metalloregulatory activities of the arsR. Gel mobility shift assays were used to examine the DNA binding activity of His6-tagged wild type and truncated ArsRs (Fig. 3). Wild type and RN9H6, RN89H6, and RC93H6 each retarded the migration of the promoter DNA. However, none of monomeric truncated proteins RN41H6, RC80H6, or RC85H6 formed a retardation species with arspromoter DNA. An equimolar mixture of RN41H6 and RC80H6 similarly did not retard DNA migration. The affinity of the purified ArsRs for promoter was determined (Fig. 4). From a least-squares fit of the data, the K d of the His6-tagged wild type ArsR was calculated to be approximately 1 μm. The affinity of RN9H6, RN89H6, and RC93H6 was each reduced approximately 4–8-fold. These results indicate that removal of the first eight residues from the amino terminus or residues 94–117 from the carboxyl terminus prevents neither dimerization nor DNA binding but causes some reduction in affinity for the promoter. This decreased affinity for DNA is consistent with the increased basal level of expression observedin vivo (Fig. 2).Figure 4Affinity of wild type and truncated ArsRs for promoter DNA. ArsRs at the indicated protein concentrations were incubated with 0.25 μm purified DNA probe, and the binding mixtures were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried, and the amount of free probe and protein-probe complex was quantified with an AMBIS radioactive analysis system.

Cys-37 is able to participate in metal binding but is not required for induction. The effect of phenylarsine oxide, which is the most effective inducer of the ars operon (2Xu C. Shi W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), on the DNA binding properties of his-tagged wild type ArsR and truncated ArsRs RN9H6, RN89H6, and RC93H6 was determined in gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 5). Each protein dissociated completely from promoter DNA with 50 μm phenylarsine oxide. Thus, removal of ArsR residues 1–8 or 90–117 does not prevent metal recognition nor the ability of metal to dissociate the repressor from the promoter. The 117-residue ArsR repressor purifies as a dimer (2Xu C. Shi W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the dimeric form binds to DNA (15Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Is dimerization essential for regulation? We have shown previously that when gene fusions were constructed between arsR and blaM, fusions encoding ArsR-β-lactamase chimerae retained metalloregulation when the fusion site was at arsR codons 92 or greater (2Xu C. Shi W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In contrast, gene fusions to arsR codons 79 or less lost metalloregulation. However, the oligomeric state of the products of the gene fusions was not determined. In this study truncated ArsR proteins were produced with the objective of investigating the relationship between dimerization and function of the ArsR protein. Three methods were used to analyze the results of truncations as follows: the yeast two-hybrid system, in vivo regulatory properties in E. coli, and biochemical analyses in vitro. The yeast two-hybrid system has been used to characterize protein-protein interactions (17White M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10001-10003Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This assay was used to determine regions of ArsR that could be deleted without preventing homodimerization (Fig. 1). A full-length arsR gene was fused to the sequence for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and full-length and partial arsR sequences were fused to the GAL4 activation domain. Full-length ArsR and those with carboxyl-terminal truncations retaining residues 1–93 or 1–89 were able to interact with a full-length ArsR, whereas the products of deletions that retained the sequences for residues 1–87, 1–85, 1–83, 1–80, and 1–61 did not interact with the full-length ArsR. For amino-terminal truncation mutants, the product of deletion of codons for the first 8 amino acids of ArsR retained the ability to interact with a full-length ArsR. In contrast, removal of the first 11 or 40 residues of ArsR abolished interaction. Thus the dimerization domain of ArsR must be contained between residues 9 and 89. To confirm the results from the two-hybrid analysis, a series of genes encoding His6-tagged full-length and truncated ArsRs were constructed. The gene products were expressed and purified. By size exclusion chromatography, ArsRH6, RN9H6, RN89H6, and RC93H6 proteins migrated as apparent dimers. Three other proteins, RN41H6, RC80H6, RC85H6, migrated as monomers (Table III). These results are consistent with results from the two-hybrid system, confirming that sequences required for dimerization are contained in a core of residues 9–89. If dimerization is required for the metalloregulatory activity of ArsR, then there should be a correlation between the aggregation state of the protein and its ability to repress in the absence of inducer and derepress in the presence of inducer. The in vivo regulatory properties of the wild type arsR and deletion mutants were examined using a lacZ reporter gene under control of thears promoter. There was a clear correlation between the ability of an arsR gene to regulate transcription of the reporter gene in trans and the ability of its gene product to dimerize (Fig. 2). Similarly the in vitro DNA binding properties of the truncated ArsRs correlated with their ability to dimerize. RN9H6, RN89H6, and RC93H6, each of which eluted from gel filtration as a dimer, retained the ability to bind to thears promoter (Fig. 3) and dissociated from the DNA upon binding of inducer (Fig. 5). In contrast, the monomeric RN41H6, RC80H6, and RC85H6 proteins lost their ability to bind to the arspromoter (Fig. 3). These data are all consistent with dimerization being essential for ArsR function. The chromosomal ArsR is a member of the ArsR family of metalloregulatory proteins (3Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Shi W.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Members of this family have variable lengths, with a core of similar residues and variable lengths on the amino and carboxyl termini. The smallest is ArsR of the archebacteriumMethanococcus jannaschii, with only 89 residues (18Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A.

That homolog aligns with residues 2–90 of the E. coli ArsR, with all of the identities between ArsR residues 9 and 89 (Fig.6). Similarly, the degree of similarity between theE. coli and plasmid R773 ArsRs, both of which consist of 117 residues, is 75% along its entire sequence but 86% within residues 9–89 (not shown). This is consistent with the results of the present study that demonstrate that a core sequence of approximately 80 residues is sufficient for all of the regulatory properties of the ArsR repressor: dimerization, DNA binding, and metal recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2019505925,"Abstract Immunoblot analysis and [3H]ryanodine binding were used to characterize and identify ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in nonexcitable mouse parotid acini. Western analysis revealed ryanodine receptor type III (Ry3R) to be the only detectable isoform in parotid microsomal membranes. Binding of [3H]ryanodine to microsomal fractions was dependent on Ca2+, salt, pH, and temperature. At 23 °C, and in the presence of 0.5 m KCl and 100 μm Ca2+, [3H]ryanodine bound specifically to membranes with high affinity (K d = 6 nm); maximum binding capacity (B max) was 275 fmol/mg protein. Mg2+ and ruthenium red inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding (IC50 = 1.4 mm and 0.5 μm, respectively). 4-Chloro-3-ethylphenol enhanced the binding of [3H]ryanodine 2.5-fold; whereas ATP and caffeine were much less efficacious toward activating Ry3R (56% and 18% maximal enhancement, respectively). Bastadin, a novel modulator of the 12-kDa FK506 binding protein·RyR complex, increased [3H]ryanodine binding 3–4-fold by enhancingK d. The immunosuppressant FK506 enhanced [3H]ryanodine receptor occupancy at >100 μm and antagonized the action of bastadin, suggesting that an immunophilin modulates Ry3R in parotid acini. These results suggest that Ry3R may play an important role in Ca2+ homeostasis in mouse parotid acini."

During the formation of metastases, migrating cells are confronted by natural tissue barriers, such as connective tissue stroma and basal lamina (2Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S.

The ability of malignant cells to penetrate these barriers depends upon the presence of enzymes capable of degrading extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ddH2O, doubly distilled water; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HIP, heparin/heparan sulfate-interacting protein; HP, heparin; HS, heparan sulfate(s); HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; SAL,d-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. components (1Nicolson G.L.

For these reasons, considerable effort has been focused on the study of tissue-degradative enzymes produced and secreted by metastatic tumor cells as well as normal cells of the tissue being invaded. Important ECM targets for degradation by invading melanoma cells are the heparan sulfate (HS) chains found on proteoglycans (3Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 36: 157-167Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 6Nicolson G.L. Menter D.G. Herrmann J.L. Cavanaugh P. Jia L. Hamada J. Yun Z. Marchetti D. Crit. Rev.

Proteins containing one or more covalently attached HS chains are called HS proteoglycans (HSPGs). The dynamic role of HSPGs in biology has become increasingly apparent (8Fransson L.A. Havsmark B.

As a result of characterizing heparin (HP) and HS binding sites related to the initial attachment of trophoblast cells to uterine epithelial cells of murine and human origin, we recently reported the cell surface expression and molecular cloning of a novel HP/HS-interacting protein (HIP) of human epithelial and endothelial cells (24Raboudi N. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11930-11939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol.

HIP not only recognizes HS and HP in a highly specific fashion, but it also binds a subset of HP and forms of HS enriched at cell surfaces and in ECM. In contrast, HIP does not bind intracellular or secreted forms of HS. Furthermore, HIP also appears to bind the anticoagulantly active species of HP efficiently and with high affinity. 2S. Liu and D.D. Carson, submitted for publication. HP octasaccharides, but not hexasaccharides, are large enough to bind HIP with high affinity. Thus, HIP appears to recognize a motif that at least overlaps the anticoagulant motif in HP and HS chains. In light of the above findings, activities that mediate HSPG degradation are expected to have significant regulatory consequences. Indeed, HSPG catabolism is observed in inflammation, wound repair, diabetes, and cancer metastasis, suggesting that enzymes that degrade the HS chains play important roles in pathologic processes (3Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 36: 157-167Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 4Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar). Furthermore, malignant cells are capable of modulating cellular interactions with HSPGs by producing and releasing a HS-degrading enzyme, heparanase (3Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 36: 157-167Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Marchetti D. Menter D. Jin L. Nakajima M. Nicolson G.L. Int. J.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 203-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that purified, high M r subpopulations of cell surface HS were more sensitive to heparanase action than secreted HS (29Marchetti D. McQuillan D.J. Spohn W.C. Carson D.D. Nicolson G.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2856-2863PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the relationship between tumor (melanoma) heparanase activity and HIP binding in HS subpopulations whether on the cell surface, secreted, or deposited in the ECM. By use of sensitive heparanase assays that separate [35S]HS species by agarose gel electrophoresis (27Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by high pressure liquid chromatography (3Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 36: 157-167Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Marchetti D. Menter D. Jin L. Nakajima M. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and an equally sensitive HIP peptide binding analysis, we report that heparanase preferentially degrades HS species, which possess GAG motifs recognized by HIP peptide. Conversely, coincubation of HIP peptide with HS and heparanase inhibits heparanase activity, suggesting that HIP peptide and heparanase compete for the same regions within the polysaccharides of cellular and ECM proteoglycans. Heparin and heparan sulfate were acquired from Sigma. [3H]Heparin (0.44 mCi/mg) and [35S]sulfate (43 Ci/mg) were purchased from DuPont NEN and ICN Biochemical (Irvine, CA), respectively. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Dulbecco's minimum essential medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. HIP peptide (CRPKAKAKAKAKDQTK) and a scrambled HIP peptide sequence (CQKAKTRAKAAKPDKK) were synthesized on a Vega 250 peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) technology by the M. D. Anderson Peptide Synthesis Core Laboratory. All other chemicals used were reagent grade or better. Early passage murine B16B15b (6Nicolson G.L. Menter D.G. Herrmann J.L. Cavanaugh P. Jia L.

Cancer. 1993; 55: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and human 70W lines (30Ishikawa M. Fernandez B. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4897-4903PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained as monolayer cultures in 1:1 (v/v) Dulbecco's minimum essential medium/Ham's F12 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air (v/v) atmosphere. The cells were subcultured every 3–4 days by trypsin-EDTA treatment, except for the 70W cell line, for which medium was changed every 24 h. Growth medium was changed every 3 days for low density cultures. All cell lines were subcultured when they reached 60–80% confluence. The human RL95 cell line, a uterine adenocarcinoma (31Way D.L. Grosso P.S. Davis J.R. Surwit E.A. Christian C.D. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), was chosen as a source of HS because more than 95% of sulfated glycosaminoglycans synthesized by these cells are HS (32Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). RL95 cells were grown in 1:1 (v/v) Dulbecco's minimum essential medium/Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The [35S]O4 labeling was performed in low sulfate media as described previously (31Way D.L. Grosso P.S. Davis J.R. Surwit E.A. Christian C.D. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). All cell lines were periodically checked for mycoplasma contamination using a Geneprobe kit (San Diego, CA), and only mycoplasma-free cells were used. Subconfluent cells (2 × 108) were harvested and solubilized in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma), 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined using the Pierce Coomassie Blue protein assay protocol. The cellular extract (20–70 μg of protein) was then incubated in specific heparanase assays employing various radiolabeled HS substrates as indicated below. Heparanase was partially purified from cultured murine (B16B15b; Ref.42Jin L. Nakajima M. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 1088-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or human (70W) melanoma cells as here described. Cells were harvested by a brief treatment with 2 mm EDTA (for B16B15b) or 0.05% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA (for 70W cells) in PBS at pH 7.2. Released cells (2 × 108) were extracted at 4 °C for 30 min in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide (buffer 1). The cell extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing approximately 50 mg of protein was passed through a column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech. Inc.) equilibrated with buffer 1. The heparin-Sepharose column was sequentially washed with buffer 1:20 mm sodium acetate containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 6.0 (buffer 2) and 0.15 m sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0 (buffer 3). Heparin-binding proteins were eluted with a linear sodium chloride gradient (0.15–1.5m) in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0. The eluted materials were monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm, and the heparanase activity was measured as described below. Fractions containing heparanase activity after this step contained approximately 5 mg of protein and 90% of total heparanase activity. Following dialysis against buffer 3, the heparanase-containing fractions were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a concanavalin A-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer 3. After the column had been washed with buffer 3, concanavalin A-binding proteins were eluted with 1.0 m α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside in buffer 3. The eluate, containing approximately 0.3 mg of protein and 72% of total heparanase activity, was collected, extensively dialyzed against buffer 3, and concentrated with Centricon 30 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Thus, these preparations were approximately 120-fold enriched for heparanase activity over the initial 30,000 ×g soluble cell extracts. RPMI 1640 medium was used as the basal medium for [35S]sulfate metabolic labeling of RL95 cell HS subpopulations as described previously (27Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, nearly confluent RL95 cells were rinsed several times with serum-free RPMI 1640 (minus sulfate) supplemented with 3.3 mmMgCl2, 1.2 g/liter NaHCO3, 15 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 2.5 units/ml penicillin, and 2.5 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Streptomycin sulfate (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) served as the sole source of nonradioactive sulfate in this medium (final concentration, ∼2 μm). The cells were incubated overnight in the same low sulfate medium described above containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]sulfate. Anion exchange chromatography demonstrated that [35S]HS synthesized by RL95 in low sulfate media had an elution profile identical to that of [35S]HS synthesized in sulfate-replete medium, indicating that HS was sulfated to a similar degree under both conditions. The medium was collected and used as a source of secreted [35S]HSPGs. Cell monolayers then were rinsed several times with ice-cold PBS. The cell monolayers then were incubated for 30 min on ice with PBS containing 50 μg/ml trypsin to release cell surface proteoglycans. Cells did not detach from the tissue culture surfaces under these conditions, nor was cell viability compromised as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. The material released into the “trypsinate” was collected and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min and immediately cooled on ice to inactivate the trypsin. The trypsinate was extensively dialyzed against ddH2O and aliquots of the dialysis buffer were examined after each dialysis step until only background levels of radioactivity were detected. Samples of both RL95 cell surface and secreted HSPGs then were either incubated overnight with Pronase (10 mg/ml; Refs. 33Sjoberg I. Fransson L.A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar and 34Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) or subjected to alkaline borohydride treatment (β-elimination) at 45 °C in the presence of 0.05 m NaOH, 1 m sodium borohydride for 24 h, followed by neutralization with acetic acid (35Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Precipitates were collected, and supernatants were dialyzed extensively with ddH2O. Aliquots were removed and radioactivity determined. Sensitivity to nitrous acid degradation (35Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) was used to confirm the identity of HS. Briefly, samples for digestion were dissolved in a 0.5:0.5:1.0 (v/v/v) ratio of 20% (v/v) N-butyl-nitrite in 100% ethanol:1 n HCl: ddH2O. As controls, parallel digestions of 1 mg of heparin in 1 ml of the same solvent or solvent lacking N-butyl-nitrite were performed. Samples were digested for 4 h at 25 °C with occasional agitation. At the end of incubation, 110 volume of 10% (v/v) cetylpyridinium chloride solution was added to the control samples. Only tubes in which the N-butyl-nitrite was omitted immediately formed a turbid precipitate. Samples were then lyophilized and analyzed by gel permeation HPLC. The size of HS chains was estimated by liquid chromatography by Superose 6 column chromatography (1.0 × 30 cm; Pharmacia). The resin was eluted with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, at a flow rate of 0.40 ml/min, and 0.4-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots were taken for determination of radioactivity by scintillation counting. Molecular size estimates for GAG chains were based on the method of Wasteson (36Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) using chondroitin sulfate chains of known molecular mass as calibration standards (27Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37McQuillan D.J. Findlay D.M. Hocking A.M. Yanagashita M. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A reaction consisting of 10–20 μl of heparanase enzyme source in 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was mixed with electrophoresis buffer at a final concentration of 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 2.5% (w/v) Ficoll (type 400) in ddH2O as described previously (27Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before electrophoresis, 1% (w/v) SDS final concentration was added to each sample for 15 min at 25 °C to dissociate35S-labeled digestion products from high molecular weight complexes. Following this step, agarose gel 1.2% (w/v) electrophoresis in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS, 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.3) and 1 mm EDTA was performed at 50 V for 1 h at 25 °C or until the samples migrated approximately two-thirds of the entire gel length as indicated by the tracking dye. Autoradiography was performed on the dried gel by exposure to X-AR 5 film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) for 3–7 days. The direction of electrophoresis shown in all figures is from top to bottom. Alternatively, heparanase activity was determined by high speed gel permeation chromatography (38Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with some modifications (27Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). B16B15b or 70W melanoma cells were used as a source of heparanase activity (7Marchetti D. Menter D. Jin L. Nakajima M. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that 1) these brain-metastatic clones possess higher heparanase content than their respective murine (B16F1) or human (MeWo) parental counterparts, and 2) the heparanase activity is indistinguishable in these two cellular sources by the two heparanase assays used in the present studies (7Marchetti D. Menter D. Jin L. Nakajima M. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, subconfluent cells were harvested and solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates then were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and concentrated by an Amicon-30 microconcentration unit (Amicon, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To perform heparanase digestions, cell lysates (50–70 μg of protein) were incubated with [35S]HS (5 × 105dpm) and 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, for 18 h at 37 °C (10–100 μl final reaction volume). The reaction was terminated by heating samples for 15 min at 95 °C. A delipidation step was applied to cell lysates following heparanase incubation and before Superose 6 liquid chromatographic analyses as described above. Alternatively, supernatants (50–100 μl) following the delipidation step were injected into a TSK gel G3000 PWX2 column (7.8 mm × 30 cm; 6-μm particle size from Toso Haas (Montgomeryville, PA)) for the high speed gel permeation chromatography. A flow rate of 0.50 ml/min was used, and fractions were collected every 30 s. Radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter (Pharmacia; 75% efficiency). Heparanase activity by gel permeation chromatography decreased in the area of the high M r half of intact radiolabeled HS peak and correlated with incubation time. Only data within a linear range for relative activity measurements were taken into account, with relative degradation activity determined by the amount of radiolabeled HS degraded/min/μg of protein (7Marchetti D. Menter D. Jin L. Nakajima M. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By performing these heparanase analyses using cellular extracts from subconfluent murine (B16B15b) or human (70W) cells, we have determined heparanase activity, whether from murine or human sources, to behave identically toward the substrate as already reported (7Marchetti D. Menter D. Jin L. Nakajima M. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Marchetti D. McQuillan D.J. Spohn W.C. Carson D.D. Nicolson G.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2856-2863PubMed Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling of endothelial cell monolayers, preconfluent cultures were incubated for 72 h with H2[35S]SO4 at 50 μCi/ml. Cloned endothelial (bovine aortic or murine brain) cells were cultured and used for extracellular matrix isolation as described previously (39Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Bar-Ner M. Ariar Y. Schirrmacher V. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2704-2711PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the endothelial monolayers were rinsed three times with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then incubated in the same buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were swollen in 20 mm NH4OH for 5 min at 25 °C and monitored under a microscope until lysis occurred. Remaining nuclei and cytoskeletons were removed by extensive washes with Dulbecco's PBS containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and equilibrated at 37 °C in medium plus 10% (v/v) calf serum to remove residual free isotope. Proteoglycans then were extracted from the subendothelial matrix by incubation overnight at 4 °C with extraction buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors. The extraction buffer consisted of 4m guanidine-HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 1% (w/v) CHAPS, and 5 mm EDTA. To determine the composition of ECM [35S]HSPGs, the digested material was extensively dialyzed against ddH2O and desalted on a PD-10 column. Only components eluting at V 0 of the column were retained for further analyses. These fractions then were digested with chondroitinase ABC (Boehringer Mannheim) at 2 units/ml in a solution containing 50 mm Tris, 50 mm sodium citrate, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, for 24 h at 37 °C. Chondroitinase-resistant samples were separated from digested material by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography and then characterized directly by filtration on a Sepharose CL-6B column (0.7 × 35 cm) with 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, at a flow rate of 5.5 ml/h. V 0 and total volume (V t) were marked by the elution positions of blue dextran and vitamin B12, respectively. Vitamin B12 co-eluted with [35S]SO4 and accurately marked V t for each column. Free glycosaminoglycans were prepared by proteoglycan digestion with Pronase and by mild alkaline hydrolysis as described above. The identity of HS in these fractions was confirmed by nitrous acid degradation. [3H]HP and [35S]HS binding to HIP peptide was performed in 96-well microassay plates (Corning, New York, NY). Briefly, 2 mg of HIP peptide was conjugated to 2 mg of maleimide-activated BSA (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the HIP peptide-BSA conjugate was isolated by chromatography on Sephadex G-50 equilibrated and eluted with PBS. Fifty μl of a 100 μg/ml solution of HIP peptide-BSA in PBS was added to each well and dried at 37 °C overnight. The next day, each well was rinsed with 200 μl of PBS three times, and 100 μl of 0.1% (w/v) heat-denatured BSA (90 °C for 20 min) was added and incubated for 1 h to block residual protein-binding sites. Afterward, wells were rinsed three times with 200 μl of PBS. Binding was performed in 50 μl of binding buffer (PBS"

Deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes the formation of deoxyhypusine by conjugation of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to the ε-amino group of one specific lysine residue of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) precursor protein. However, in the absence of the eIF-5A precursor, catalysis involves only the NAD-dependent cleavage of spermidine to generate 1,3-diaminopropane and a putative 4-carbon amine intermediate that gives rise to Δ1-pyrroline. We have obtained evidence for a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate that accumulates in the absence of the eIF-5A precursor. Incubation of human recombinant enzyme with [1,8-3H]spermidine and NAD, followed by reduction with NaBH3CN, resulted in specific radiolabeling of the enzyme. The radioactive component in the reduced enzyme intermediate was identified as deoxyhypusine and was shown to occur at a single locus. The fact that labeled deoxyhypusine was found after treatment with a reducing agent suggests an intermediate with the butylamine moiety derived from spermidine attached through an imine linkage to the ε-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the enzyme. This residue has been identified as lysine 329. Separate experiments showing efficient transfer of labeled butylamine moiety from enzyme intermediate to eIF-5A precursor strongly support a reaction mechanism involving an imine intermediate.

Kang, manuscript in preparation. are essential for yeast viability. Effective inhibitors of deoxyhypusine synthase have been developed; these inhibitors cause inhibition of hypusine synthesis in eIF-5A in cells and also have been shown to inhibit proliferation of various mammalian cells (6Park M.H.

In view of the position of the enzyme as the first step in the biosynthesis of hypusine, such inhibitors could have an important place in therapy of hyperproliferative conditions. A thorough understanding of the mechanism and regulation of this enzyme is therefore of great interest. Deoxyhypusine synthase has been purified from rat testis (16Wolff E.C. Lee Y.B. Chung S.I.

The recombinant enzymes, purified after expression of the human or yeast cDNA in Escherichia coli, are now available in essentially homogeneous form. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme is highly conserved; it appears that the enzyme from all species studied exists as a tetramer of identical subunits of 40–43 kDa (depending on the species) and that the cofactor requirements and catalytic properties of the enzyme from different species are similar (16Wolff E.C.

In a complete reaction mixture containing spermidine, NAD, and eIF-5A precursor, deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes an NAD-dependent cleavage of spermidine to generate free 1,3-diaminopropane and an enzyme-bound 4-aminobutyl moiety, which is subsequently transferred to a lysine of the eIF-5A precursor to form the deoxyhypusine residue. However, if the eIF-5A precursor is absent from the reaction mixture, deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes only part of this reaction, namely the cleavage of spermidine; in this case 1,3-diaminopropane and Δ1-pyrroline are observed as products (16Wolff E.C.

The role of dehydrogenation of spermidine was established in experiments that showed the transfer of3H from [5-3H]spermidine to NAD as a critical initial step of the reaction (23Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these and other early observations, which established the origin of the atoms of deoxyhypusine (24Park M.H. Cooper H.L. Folk J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 14108-14111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we proposed an overall scheme, similar to that shown in Scheme FS1. The proposed mechanism involved a dehydrospermidine intermediate, probably tightly bound to the enzyme (23Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and possibly an enzyme-imine intermediate (3Park M.H. Joe Y.A. Kang K.R. Lee Y.B. Wolff E.C. Amino Acids. 1996; 10: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Wolff E.C. Lee Y.B. Chung S.I. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8660-8666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, there was no tangible evidence for the existence of a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate. We speculated that if a transient intermediate with the 4-carbon amine moiety from spermidine attached to the enzyme, e.g. through an imine linkage, is involved in the catalysis, it might be possible to trap the unsaturated intermediate in a stable form by the use of a reducing agent such as NaBH4. Following the pioneering observations of Fischer et al. (28Fischer E.H. Kent A.B. Snyder E.R. Krebs E.G. J. Am. Chem Soc. 1958; 80: 2906-2907Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), numerous examples have appeared in the literature of detection of unsaturated enzyme intermediates by this method (29Grazi E.

The present results, summarized in Scheme FS1, indicate that such an unsaturated enzyme-substrate intermediate derived from spermidine (Enz-N=CH(CH2)3NH2 in Scheme FS1) is indeed formed by modification of a specific lysine residue, namely Lys329 of human deoxyhypusine synthase. Furthermore, we present evidence that this postulated intermediate can act as a catalytic transfer intermediate in deoxyhypusine synthesis in eIF-5A.Figure 2Ion exchange chromatographic separation of deoxyhypusine in acid hydrolysates of reduced enzyme-substrate intermediate (A) and soluble spermidine cleavage products (B).

Highly purified human deoxyhypusine synthase (1–3 μl, 2–6 μg) was added to mixtures of reactants preheated at 37 °C in siliconized Eppendorf tubes to give, typically, 20 μl containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 500 μm NAD, and 7.5 μm[1,8-3H]spermidine (4 μCi) in 0.2 mglycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5. After 2 min, or the specified time, at 37 °C, the tubes were transferred to an ice bath and NaBH3CN was added (1 μl of 0.1 m in H2O, freshly prepared from the recrystallized compound, for a total of 3–4 portions at 10-min intervals) to a final concentration of 15–20 mm. Specific details are given in the figure legends. For SDS-PAGE, 25–100 μg of bovine serum albumin was added to a portion of each reaction mixture and the proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were dissolved in Tricine sample buffer containing mercaptoethanol, adjusted to neutral pH with Tris base, placed in boiling water for 3–4 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a precast 10% (Novex) Tricine gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, soaked in water for 30 min and in 1 m sodium salicylate for 60 min, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film at −70 °C. For ion-exchange chromatographic analysis of deoxyhypusine and polyamines, another portion of the enzyme-labeling reaction mixture was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 500 μg of carrier BSA, the precipitates washed three or four times with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 2 mm spermidine, and subjected to acid hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 105 °C for 16 h. The hydrolysate and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble reaction products were analyzed by an ion-exchange chromatography system described previously (38Park M.H. Cooper H.L. Folk J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 458-462Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) employing sodium citrate/NaCl buffers: Buffer A (0.6 nNa+, pH 5.8), Buffer B (1.5 n Na+, pH 5.55), Buffer C (3 n Na+, pH 5.55) for 5, 10, and 30 min, respectively. The identification of reaction products was as reported previously (23Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For sequence determination, labeled human deoxyhypusine synthase was prepared as outlined above on a large scale, using 400 μg of enzyme in a final volume of 2 ml; [1,8-3H]spermidine was diluted with non-radioactive spermidine to a final concentration of 108 μm (400 μCi/2 ml). After reduction of the enzyme intermediate, protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid without addition of bovine serum albumin, and the precipitates were washed thoroughly with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 2 mm spermidine, followed by ice-cold acetone (two washes). The protein was digested for 10 h at 37 °C in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.1, containing 0.15 units of trypsin (300 units/mg) and 0.1% reduced Triton (Sigma). The trypsin level was brought to 0.3 units, and the digestion was continued for an additional 14 h. Separation of peptides was performed on a 2 mm × 250 mm C-18 column (Vydac) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in HPLC water; a gradient was then applied over 90 min bringing the elution buffer (90% acetonitrile, 10% HPLC water, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid) to 65% acetonitrile. A hydrophobic radiolabeled peptide eluting as a single peak later in the gradient was identified as peptide A by electrophoresis and TLC as described in the legend to Fig. 5. Another radiolabeled peptide eluted from the C-18 early in the gradient was identified as peptide B; after further purification on an ion-exchange column, the radioactive peak fraction was desalted using a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems C-18 column, 1.0 mm × 50 mm, in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, brought to 50% acetonitrile:50% water over 30 min. This peptide was subjected to 7 cycles of Edman automated degradation to yield GXIR as a major sequence; no equivalent amount of amino acid derivative was seen after the fourth cycle. The tryptic digestion, separation of peptides, and sequence determination by automated Edman degradation were carried out at the Michigan State Macromolecular Structure Facility under the direction of Joseph F. Leykam, Department of Biochemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI. It was observed previously that deoxyhypusine synthase acts to cleave spermidine to 1,3-diaminopropane and a 4-carbon amine moiety both in the presence and absence of the eIF-5A precursor, although the nature of the 4-carbon product is different in the two cases. The butylamine moiety becomes the extended side chain of deoxyhypusine in the eIF-5A precursor protein in the former case and free Δ1-pyrroline in the latter (23Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that if a common, transient intermediate is involved in formation of the two 4-carbon products, it would be more likely to accumulate in the absence of eIF-5A precursor, since in this case the spermidine cleavage reaction proceeds at a much slower rate. If, after the initial dehydrogenation of spermidine and cleavage of the N4–C5 bond, the resulting butylamine moiety is covalently attached to enzyme through an unsaturated linkage, it should be possible to produce a stable derivative of the postulated intermediate by reduction of the reaction mixture. We succeeded in demonstrating that, in the absence of the normal acceptor of the butylamine moiety, the eIF-5A precursor, radioactivity from [1,8-3H]spermidine was indeed retained on the enzyme protein after brief incubation of deoxyhypusine synthase, NAD and [1,8-3H]spermidine if the reaction mixture was subsequently treated with either NaBH4 or NaBH3CN. The labeling appeared to be more efficient with NaBH3CN than NaBH4, as noted by others (34Borch R.F. Bernstein M.D. Durst H.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 2897-2904Crossref Scopus (2091) Google Scholar,35Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4359-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of a typical experiment are shown in Fig.1. In the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig.1 A), the single band of human deoxyhypusine synthase is shown at ∼41 kDa (indicated by the arrow), along with several bands from bovine serum albumin, added to aid in the trichloroacetic acid precipitation of protein before SDS-PAGE. The fluorogram of the same gel (Fig. 1 B) shows one band of radioactivity, which is at the position of the enzyme (arrow), only in the sample i"
https://openalex.org/W2085049920,"The regulated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) plays an important role in inflammation and immune responses. Induction of ICAM-1 gene transcription by TNF-α has previously been shown to be dependent upon a region of the ICAM-1 5′-flanking sequences that contains a modified κB site. We demonstrate here that this modified κB site alone is insufficient for induction of transcription by TNF-α. Site-directed mutagenesis of both the κB site and specific flanking nucleotides demonstrates that both the specific 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences and the modified κB site are necessary for TNF-α induction. Further, site-directed mutagenesis of this modified κB site to a consensus κB site allows it to mediate transcriptional activation in response to TNF-α, even in the absence of specific flanking sequences. Transcription through this minimal ICAM-1 TNF-α-responsive region can be driven by co-expression of p65, and the minimal response element interacts with p65 and p50 in supershift mobility shift assays. However, when in vitro transcription/translation products for the Rel proteins are used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, only p65 is capable of binding the minimal response element while both p50 and p65 bind a consensus κB oligonucleotide. Additionally, in the absence of the specific flanking nucleotides, the ICAM-1 κB site is incapable of DNA-protein complex formation in both electrophoretic mobility shift assay and UV cross-linking/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. These results demonstrate the requirement for specific flanking sequences surrounding a κB binding site for functional transcription factor binding and transactivation and TNF-α-mediated induction of ICAM-1.

Cell. 1988; 52: 925-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) As the counter-receptor for the leukocyte β2 integrins, ICAM-1 plays a central role in a number of inflammatory and immune responses. Although ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed on a variety of cell types, including hematopoietic cells, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelium (3Rothlein R. Dustin M.L. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1270-1274PubMed Google Scholar), its regulated expression is fundamental to leukocyte trafficking. Up-regulated ICAM-1 expression on cytokine-activated vascular endothelial cells controls the targeted transmigration of leukocytes into specific areas of inflammation. In addition, ICAM-1 can be induced on some cells types in which it is not constitutively expressed (e.g. human keratinocytes (4Dustin M.L. Singer K.H. Tuck D.T. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1323-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar)), further fine tuning the localized inflammatory reaction once leukocyte transmigration has occurred. ICAM-1 expression can be induced by a variety of cytokines, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1, as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (5Dustin M.L. Rothlein R. Bhan A.K. Dinarello C.A. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 245-254PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pober J.S. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Lapierre L.A. Mendrick D.L. Fiers W. Rothlein R. Springer T.A.

Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both IFN-γ and TNF-α have been shown to mediate this induction at the level of transcription (5Dustin M.L. Rothlein R. Bhan A.K. Dinarello C.A. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 245-254PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wertheimer S.J. Myers C.L. Wallace R.W. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12030-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular events underlying the transcriptional activation of the ICAM-1 gene in response to TNF-α stimulation are not fully understood. In the up-regulation of other cellular adhesion molecules by TNF-α, it has been shown that TNF-α induces expression by activation of members of the NF-κB (Rel) family of transcription factors (10Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). There are five known members of the Rel family, NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB (11Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The first NF-κB complex described consisted of p65, p50, and the inhibitor IκB-α pre-existent in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation with TNF-α, IκB-α is degraded, unmasking nuclear translocation signals on p65 and p50. These proteins translocate to the nucleus, bind to DNA as a heterodimer (p65/p50) through a decameric consensus sequence (GGGRNNYYCC), and mediate transactivation (10Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar, 12Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 13Liou H.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Since this original description, individual subunits of the NF-κB complex have been shown to regulate transcriptional activity as homodimers or as heterodimers with other members of the Rel family. Specifically, both p50 and p65 homodimers, as well as heterodimers with other members of the Rel family, are capable of modulating transcription. Further, this activation requires a DNA binding sequence that is specific for the particular dimer (9Wertheimer S.J. Myers C.L. Wallace R.W. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12030-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and binding of both subunits is required for activation (14Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Ruben C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While a κB site has been implicated in induction of ICAM-1 gene expression by TNF-α (11Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 15Jahnke A. Johnson J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16van de Stolpe A. Caldenhoven E. Stade B.G. Koenderman L. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Johnson J.P. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6185-6192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is now apparent that this transcriptional regulatory process is more complex than initially described. By deletional and mutational analysis, we show that a variant κB site plus the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions are necessary and sufficient for induction of ICAM-1 by TNF-α, demonstrating the requirement of specific flanking nucleotides to a κB site. Thus, these specific flanking sequences may be necessary for stabilizing Rel protein binding to this sub-optimal κB site. Further, these data implicate DNA sequences surrounding nonconsensus κB sites in directing specific Rel family member binding and may, thus, participate in directing gene specific transactivation. C32 melanoma cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 3 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). As described previously (17Kubota Y. Kleinman H. Martin G.R. Lawley T.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 107: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 18Lawley T.J. Kubota Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 93: S59-S61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) were isolated from neonatal foreskins and cultured in MCDB131 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% normal human serum (Irvine Scientific), dibutyryl cAMP (5 × 10−5m, Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. Experiments with HDMEC were conducted with cells in passage 3–5. ICAM-1 based heterologous promoter/reporter plasmids were designed and constructed using techniques and strategies as described previously (19Muller S. Kammerbauer C. Simons U. Shibagaki N. Li L.-J. Caughman S.W. Degitz K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 970-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, various portions of the ICAM-1 5′-flanking region were isolated either by appropriate restriction enzyme digestion of the ICAM-1 genomic sub-clone pGλ6–2.05 (20Degitz K. Lian-Jie L. Caughman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14024-14030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by polymerase chain reaction using primers that incorporated convenient restriction sites at their 5′ ends and were specific for areas of interest within the ICAM-1 gene or, for smaller fragments, by annealing of complementary synthesized oligonucleotides (Emory University Microchemical Facility) spanning areas of interest and incorporating convenient restriction sites at either end of the double-stranded fragment. All fragments are designated by their nucleotide location with respect to the identified transcription initiation site (20Degitz K. Lian-Jie L. Caughman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14024-14030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified fragments were ligated and cloned into pBRAMScat2 (21Iyer R.R. Gene. 1991; 105: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which contains the CAT reporter gene under the control of the Herpes simplex virus minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter and multiple cloning sites designed for analysis of eukaryotic enhancers. Single and multiple base mutations within the region of interest were generated within complementary synthesized oligonucleotides and ligated into pBRAMScat2. Inserts and ligation sites of all vectors generated from either polymerase chain reaction-generated or oligonucleotide synthesized fragments were confirmed by sequence analysis via the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using the Sequenase 2.0 Quick-Denature Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to modify the ICAM-1 constructs −199/−170 TK-CAT and −186/−177 TK-CAT such that they contained a consensus κB site. To generate these point mutants, the constructs were transformed into competent CJ236 Escherichia coli(prepared according to the method of Chung et al. (22Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutagenic oligonucleotides were 5′ phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (45 min, 37 °C), and the kinase was inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min followed by the addition of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA) to a concentration of 6 pmol/μl. Single-stranded DNA (400 ng) and mutagenic oligonucleotide (6 pmol) were annealed. The mutated DNA strand was then synthesized and ligated (0.5 units T7 DNA polymerase, 3 units T4 DNA ligase, 0.4 μm each dNTP, 0.75 μm ATP, 17.5 μm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3.75 μm MgCl2, 1.5 μm DTT) on ice for 5 min, 25 °C for 5 min, 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 90 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA). The resultant double-stranded product was then transformed into uracil-deficient competent XL1blue E. coli(Stratagene). Colonies were screened by dideoxy sequencing using the Sequence 2.0 Quick-Denature Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Mutagenic oligonucleotides used were the following (mutations are indicated in bold, underlined letters): for −199/−170 TK-CAT, 5′-GATCCAGCTC G GGAATTTCC-3′, and for −186/−177 TK-CAT, 5′-GGGCCGGATC G GGAATTTCCG-3′.

Plasmid DNA preparation for transfection and transcription/translation was done using the Qiagen DNA Maxiprep Kit (Qiagen). For EMSA, a full-length forward oligonucleotide and 10-base pair reverse primer were annealed, labeled with Klenow (37 °C, 30 min, 100 μCi α32P-dCTP (DuPont), 250 μm dNTPs (Perkin-Elmer)), and purified by spinning through G25 Sephadex (Boehringer Mannheim). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Emory University Microchemical Facility. Cold double-stranded DNA was made identically, except that unlabeled dCTP was substituted for labeled dCTP and the final oligonucleotide concentration was 100-fold higher. The oligonucleotides used as probes and cold competition, with κB sites underlined and primer sites double underlined, were as follows: ICAM-1 κB with ICAM-1 flanking DNA (IC/IC, representing the region −191/−172 upstream of the transcription start site), 5′-TTAGCTTGGAAATTCCGGAGCTCGAGATCCTATG-3′; ICAM-1 κB with random flanking sequences (IC/R), 5′-AACCAAAGGAAATTCCGTTAGATCCTATG-3′; consensus κB with ICAM-1 flanking sequences (C/IC), 5′-TTAGCTTGGAAATTCCCGAGCTCGAGATCCTATG-3′; consensus κB with random flanking sequences (C/R), 5′-AACCAAAGGAAATTCCCTTAGATCCTATG-3′ (as shown schematically in Fig. 4 A). Subconfluent C32 cell cultures (5 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish) were transfected with 15 μg of plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (29Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6503) Google Scholar). After exposure to precipitated plasmids for 16 h, cells were washed and medium replenished. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with TNF-α (300 units/ml, R&D Systems) for an additional 16 h. Cells were then harvested and lysates prepared as described previously (30Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5293) Google Scholar). Assays for transfection efficiency, normalization of protein, and CAT expression were performed as described previously (19Muller S. Kammerbauer C. Simons U. Shibagaki N. Li L.-J. Caughman S.W. Degitz K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 970-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Degitz K. Lian-Jie L. Caughman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14024-14030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDMEC were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA (plus 2 μg of p65 expression vector for cotransfection studies) in the presence of 500 ng/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma) at 85% confluence for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 30 min, medium containing 8 μmchloroquine was added, and the transfection was continued for an additional 2 h. After exposure to plasmids for 2.5 h, the medium was replenished. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with TNF-α (300 units/ml) for an additional 16 h. Cells were then harvested, and lysates were prepared as above. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously by Schreiber et al. (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Mueller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3921) Google Scholar) with modification by Stahl et al. (32Staal F.J.T. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment with TNF-α (300 units/ml), cells were harvested and washed two times with ice-cold PBS. They were then washed with 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 10 min with 400 μl of buffer A supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 2 min), the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was rinsed in 400 μl of buffer A without Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were resuspended in 150 μl of buffer C (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, 2.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Extracts were harvested by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was collected and stored at −70 °C for protein assay and EMSA. Proteins for the transacting factors p50, p65, RelB, c-Jun, ATF2, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ, and the Rel inhibitory protein IκB-α were generated by in vitro transcription/translation of the mammalian expression vectors described above in the T7 Coupled TNT Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the manufacturer protocol. l-[35S]methionine labeling and autoradiography or Western blotting were used to verify the integrity of the proteins generated (data not shown). For EMSA and UV cross-linking/SDS-PAGE analysis, 2 μl of a 50-μl transcription/translation reaction was used per condition shown. The method for EMSA has been described previously (33Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar,34Garner M.M. Rezvin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). In brief, the binding reactions were performed with 5 μg of nuclear extract in binding buffer (12% glycerol, 12 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF) containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 μl. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, 1 × 105 cpm of radiolabeled probe was added for an additional incubation period of 30 min. For the competition assays and supershift experiments, an excess of the appropriate unlabeled oligonucleotide (50 ng) or antibody (1 μg), respectively, was added to the binding reaction mixture prior to the initial 15-min incubation. The samples were electrophoresed at 130 V at 4 °C through 6% native polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed at −70 °C for 1–3 days. Autoradiographs were scanned on a La Cie scanner (La Cie, Ltd.) utilizing Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Inc.). The digitized image was subsequently labeled in Microsoft Power Point (Microsoft Corp.) and printed on a high resolution laser printer. Each figure represents a computer-generated image of the autoradiograph, and each is typical of the autoradiograph in the context of relative band and background densities. For UV cross-linking/SDS-PAGE analysis, probes and competitor oligonucleotides were prepared as for EMSA but substituting 3 mm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Sigma) for dTTP. Binding reactions were performed with 10 μg of nuclear extract in EMSA binding buffer containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 μl in a 96-well plate. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, 1 × 105 cpm of radiolabeled BrdUrd-containing probe was added for an additional incubation period of 30 min. For the competition assays, an excess of the appropriate unlabeled oligonucleotide (10–100-fold molar excess) was added to the binding reaction mixture prior to the initial 15-min incubation. The samples were exposed to UV irradiation in a Stratalinker (240 nm, 15 min, on ice). The binding reactions were combined with 5 μl of 6 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 2 min, loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoresed until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed at −70 °C for 1–3 days. To demonstrate specificity, after UV cross-linking, excess DNA was removed by incubation in 0.25 m CaCl2, 0.3 μg of micrococcal nuclease, and 0.05 units of DNase I at 37 °C for 30 min prior to addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Our previous work has focused on the identification and characterization of the ICAM-1 5′ regulatory region (20Degitz K. Lian-Jie L. Caughman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14024-14030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using ICAM-1-based 5′ deletion CAT reporter gene constructs, we observed that inducibility by TNF-α in C32 cells is conferred by DNA downstream of position −199 (data not shown). These data are in agreement with the results of others (11Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 15Jahnke A.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6185-6192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, a construct with a 5′ deletion to −182 retained no TNF-α inducibility (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the region below −199 and perhaps surrounding −182 is necessary for TNF-α induction of ICAM-1 expression. Sequence analysis of the ICAM-1 −199/−170 promoter region identifies a modified decameric κB site between positions −186 and −177, on the coding strand in reverse orientation. This sequence differs from the traditional κB consensus sequence in that it contains a p65 binding site but not the requisite GGG for p50 binding. To test whether the region bounded by −199/−182 or a region extending further 3′ (−199/−170) is sufficient to confer TNF-α inducibility upon a heterologous promoter, we cloned these fragments into a thymidine kinase enhancer trap expression vector (19Muller S. Kammerbauer C. Simons U. Shibagaki N. Li L.-J. Caughman S.W. Degitz K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 970-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Iyer R.R. Gene. 1991; 105: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and assayed their responsiveness to TNF-α in C32 melanoma cells. Fig.1 A demonstrates that the region bounded by −199/−170 is sufficient to confer responsiveness to TNF-α, but the region −199/−182 does not confer TNF-α inducibility. Since the −199/−182 construct splits the modified κB site, it is not surprising that it has no ability to respond to TNF-α (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, the construct containing the modified κB site alone (−186/−177) shows no induction by TNF-α (Fig.1 A) while the construct −191/−172 retains TNF-α responsiveness (although to a lower magnitude than −199/−170 because of its loss of a 5′ C/EBP binding site necessary for maximal induction (35Hou J. Baichwal V. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11641-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)). Since these results suggest that specific flanking sequences surrounding the modified κB site are necessary for TNF-α induction of transcription through this element, a series of single base pair mutations within the modified κB site and the surrounding flanking regions were made. As shown in Fig. 1 B, mutations affecting the decameric κB site abolish TNF-α induction of CAT activity and partially repress constitutive CAT activity. Most interestingly, however, mutations affecting either the 5′- or 3′-flanking regions also significantly abrogate or abolish TNF-α-induced CAT activity. These results demonstrate that these specific flanking sequences are necessary for TNF-α induction of ICAM-1 gene expression. Further, these specific flanking sequences, together with the modified κB site, represent the total sequence that is necessary and sufficient for induction of ICAM-1 expression by TNF-α. We have demonstrated similar results in HDMEC for both the minimal region and precise nucleotide sequence (data not shown), indicating that these results are not cell-type specific and that induction of ICAM-1 by TNF-α within the context of endothelial cells also requires these flanking regions. To test whether the wild-type ICAM-1 modified κB site, which deviates from a consensus κB site by a single G→C transition, is unable to drive transcriptional activation in response to TNF-α because of this single nucleotide difference, we undertook site-directed mutagenesis of this base in the heterologous promoter constructs −186/−177 TK-CAT and −199/−170 TK-CAT. We then tested the ability of these constructs transfected into HDMEC to respond to either TNF-α or p65 cotransfection. Fig.2 shows that the wild-type −186/−177 TK construct does not respond to either TNF-α or p65 cotransfection. However, when a single base C→G mutation is created at position −177, the resulting −186/−177 Cmut TK-CAT construct, which converts the wild-type decameric ICAM-1 modified κB site to a consensus κB site, is fully capable of responding to TNF-α and, at a somewhat lesser extent than the wild-type construct, to p65 cotransfection. Further, when the same change is made within the context of the −199/−170 construct that is maximally inducible by TNF-α, TNF-α responsiveness is maintained, but induction by p65 cotransfection is also decreased in comparison with the wild-type construct. These data support a transactivation pathway with the wild-type ICAM-1 TNF-α-response region that is optimally driven by p65 homodimers, and conversion of the wild-type ICAM-1 decameric κB site to a consensus κB site results in an element that likely is best driven by p50/p65 heterodimers. These results are also supported by those of Ledebur and Parks (11Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) who demonstrate that the cotransfection of increasing amounts of p50 expression vector at a constant level of p65 expression vector and a wild-type ICAM-1 TNF-α-responsive region CAT construct results in reduced levels of transactivation in comparison to p65 expression vector alone. We, too, have observed a suppressive effect with p50 expression vector cotransfection when assaying expression by a fully responsive wild-type ICAM-1 TNF-α-responsive region construct (−199/−170 TK CAT) after treatment with TNF-α or joint cotransfection with a p65 expression vector. Like other consensus κB elements (such as that in the HIV κB site), our consensus κB construct (−186/−177 Cmut TK-CAT) is less responsive to p65 cotransfection alone and is probably driven optimally by a combination of p65 and p50. What appears to be unique concerning transactivation via the full ICAM-1 TNF-α-responsive region is that specific flanking regions surrounding the wild-type decameric modified κB site are req"
https://openalex.org/W2143359183,"Superantigens interact with the T cell receptor for antigen (TCR) and are, therefore, more physiological stimulators of T lymphocytes than nonspecific polyclonal T cell mitogens. The effects of these two classes of T cell stimulators on methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) andS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) levels were investigated. Activation of resting human peripheral blood T lymphocytes by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) caused a 3- to 6-fold increase in MAT II specific activity. Although the proliferative response was higher in cultures stimulated with PHA compared with SEB, MAT II activity was comparable in both cultures. Both stimuli caused down-regulation of the MAT 68-kDa λ subunit expression and induced a comparable increase in the expression of the catalytic α2/α2′ subunit mRNA and protein. However, in superantigen-stimulated cells, the expression of the noncatalytic β subunit was down-regulated and virtually disappeared by 72 h post-stimulation; whereas, no change in the expression of this subunit was noted in PHA-stimulated cells. Thus, at 72 h following stimulation, PHA-stimulated cells expressed MAT II α2/α2′ and β subunits while SEB-stimulated cells expressed the α2/α2′ subunits only; the β subunit was no longer expressed in superantigen-stimulated cells. Kinetic analysis of MAT II in extracts of PHA- and SEB-stimulated cells using reciprocal kinetic plots revealed that in the absence of the β subunit theK m of the enzyme for l-methionine (l-Met) was 3-fold higher than in the presence of the β subunit. Furthermore, AdoMet levels were 5-fold higher in cell extracts lacking the β subunit (SEB-stimulated cell extracts) compared with extracts containing MAT II α2/α2′ and β subunits. We propose that the increased levels of AdoMet in superantigen-stimulated cells may be attributed to the absence of the β subunit, which seems to have rendered MAT II less sensitive to product feedback inhibition by (−)AdoMet. The data suggest that the β subunit of MAT II, which has no catalytic activity, may be a regulatory subunit that imparts a lowerK m for l-Met but increases the sensitivity to feedback inhibition by AdoMet. The down-regulation of the β subunit, which occurred when T cells were stimulated via the TCR, may be an important mechanism to regulate AdoMet levels at different stages of T cell differentiation under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1989565931,"Photoaffinity labeling of a soybean cotyledon membrane fraction identified a sucrose-binding protein (SBP). Subsequent studies have shown that the SBP is a unique plasma membrane protein that mediates the linear uptake of sucrose in the presence of up to 30 mm external sucrose when ectopically expressed in yeast. Analysis of the SBP-deduced amino acid sequence indicates it lacks sequence similarity with other known transport proteins. Data presented here, however, indicate that the SBP shares significant sequence and structural homology with the vicilin-like seed storage proteins that organize into homotrimers. These similarities include a repeated sequence that forms the basis of the reiterated domain structure characteristic of the vicilin-like protein family. In addition, analytical ultracentrifugation and nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrate that the SBP appears to be organized into oligomeric complexes with aM r indicative of the existence of SBP homotrimers and homodimers. The structural similarity shared by the SBP and vicilin-like proteins provides a novel framework to explore the mechanistic basis of SBP-mediated sucrose uptake. Expression of the maize Glb protein (a vicilin-like protein closely related to the SBP) in yeast demonstrates that a closely related vicilin-like protein is unable to mediate sucrose uptake.

The development of plant seeds involves the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen reserves in proteinaceous forms that can both withstand desiccation and be utilized as an energy source by the developing embryo during germination. In legume species, these predominant seed storage proteins are found enclosed in membrane-bound organelles known as protein bodies (1Millerd A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 53-72Crossref Google Scholar, 2Higgins T.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 121-191Crossref Google Scholar). The globulin seed storage proteins generally fall into two main classes: legumin-like and vicilin-like proteins (1Millerd A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 53-72Crossref Google Scholar,3Derbyshire E. Wright D.J. Boulter D. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 3-24Crossref Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 4Borroto K. Dure III, L. Plant Mol.

Under nonreducing conditions, the legumin-like proteins are found as hexameric complexes with sedimentation coefficients of 11 S. The subunits of these complexes are derived from a precursor peptide containing two domains: an N-terminal acidic α chain and a C-terminal basic β chain. Following proteolytic processing, these domains remain associated through interchain disulfide links. In contrast, the vicilin-like proteins are found as 7 S trimers under nonreducing conditions. The vicilin-like monomers are 50–70-kDa polypeptides that undergo variable levels of post-translational proteolytic processing (1Millerd A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 53-72Crossref Google Scholar, 3Derbyshire E. Wright D.J. Boulter D. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 3-24Crossref Scopus (737) Google Scholar).

Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 748-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Each monomer consists of two very similar structural domains reflecting a tandem duplication observed at the nucleotide and amino acid sequences. These tandem domains are composed of two structural elements: a compact eight-stranded β barrel having the “Swiss roll” topology and an extended loop containing several short α helices. Trimers are formed by the apposition of a hydrophobic surface composed of side chains from one face of the N-terminal domain and a complementary hydrophobic surface of the C-terminal domain of the neighboring monomer. These intermonomeric interactions are further stabilized by several salt bridges. Once formed, the trimer is a disc-shaped molecule with a large internal channel of 18 Å (8Lawrence M.C. Izard T. Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 748-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10Ko T.-P. Ng J.D. McPherson A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1993; 101: 729-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The high degree of structural conservation shared by these two vicilin-like proteins is likely the result of several evolutionary constraints including subunit interactions that are required for holoprotein assembly, packaging of holoproteins into protein bodies, tolerance to desiccation, sorting in the secretory pathway, and general constraints for stability and solubility (11Blagrove R.J.

In most legume species, sucrose is the predominant form of assimilated carbon translocated from the photosynthetically active leaves to the developing cotyledons (18Thorne J.H. Plant Physiol.

Photoaffinity labeling of membranes isolated from soybean cotyledon tissue with a photolyzable sucrose analog identified a distinct 62-kDa sucrose-binding protein (SBP) 1The abbreviations used are: SBP, sucrose-binding protein; sbp, gene for SBP; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DTSSP, 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate). (20Ripp K.G. Viitanen P.V. Hitz W.D. Franceschi V.R. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1988; 88: 1435-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the cDNA encoding the SBP and its deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the SBP contains a single hydrophobic domain at its N terminus but otherwise is a hydrophilic protein lacking the expected membrane-spanning hydrophobic segments typically present in transport proteins (21Grimes H.D. Overvoorde P.J. Ripp K.G. Franceschi V.R. Hitz W.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1561-1574PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of the topology of the SBP demonstrates that it is tightly associated with the external leaflet of the plasma membrane (22Overvoorde P.J. Grimes H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15154-15161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the SBP in sucrose uptake was implicated by immunolocalization experiments, which demonstrated that the SBP is exclusively associated with the plasma membrane of cells involved in active sucrose uptake (21Grimes H.D. Overvoorde P.J. Ripp K.G. Franceschi V.R. Hitz W.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1561-1574PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of SBP-mediated sucrose uptake in a yeast system indicates that the uptake is specific for sucrose but is proton-independent and relatively nonsaturable, thus defining a novel mechanism for sucrose uptake (15Overvoorde P.J. Frommer W.B. Grimes H.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Despite strong evidence that the SBP mediates sucrose uptake, nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis suggests that the SBP is distinct from other known transport proteins including binding protein-dependent transport systems of Escherichia coli. Here we show that a portion of the SBP amino acid sequence shares significant sequence homology with the vicilin-like seed storage proteins, including an internal sequence repeat. In addition, examination of plasma membrane fractions under nonreducing conditions show that the SBP exists in multimeric complexes that may represent dimeric and trimeric association of SBP monomers. Thus, the data presented here provide new insight into the three-dimensional organization of a unique plasma membrane protein capable of mediating sucrose uptake. Soybean (Glycine max common version Wye) seeds were grown as described (21Grimes H.D. Overvoorde P.J. Ripp K.G. Franceschi V.R. Hitz W.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1561-1574PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes from cotyledons were obtained at the indicated times after flowering or imbibition following the protocol of Overvoorde and Grimes (22Overvoorde P.J. Grimes H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15154-15161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly enriched plasma membrane proteins were obtained by aqueous two-phase partitioning as described previously (22Overvoorde P.J. Grimes H.D. J. Biol.

RNA was isolated using the protocol described by Grimes et al. (21Grimes H.D. Overvoorde P.J. Ripp K.G. Franceschi V.R. Hitz W.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1561-1574PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis ofsbp mRNA levels, the probe was a 1.7-kilobase pairNcoI/SpeI fragment of the sbp cDNA (21Grimes H.D. Overvoorde P.J. Ripp K.G. Franceschi V.R. Hitz W.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1561-1574PubMed Google Scholar) labeled with 32P by random priming with a RadPrime (Life Technologies, Inc.) kit according to the manufacturer's directions. For analysis of β-conglycinin mRNA levels, a 350-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment amplified from soybean genomic DNA was labeled with 32P by random priming. Direct sequencing of this polymerase chain reaction fragment on an ABI 373 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) confirmed the identity of this probe. Membranes containing the transferred RNA were prehybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in 1% SDS, 1 m sodium chloride, and 10% dextran sulfate. Hybridizations were carried out overnight at 65 °C in the same buffer containing 1–5 ng/ml denatured probe and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The blots were washed twice with 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 5 min each with constant agitation at room temperature, twice with 2 × SSC, 1% SDS for 30 min each at 65 °C, and twice with 0.1 × SSC for 15 min each at room temperature. Purified plasma membrane proteins were solubilized in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. This suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g(r avg) for 24 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. >85% of the membrane proteins were solubilized by this treatment. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5–25% sucrose gradient containing Buffer A supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 16 h at 130,000 ×g (r avg) in a Beckman SW40 rotor, fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the bottom. One-fifth of each fraction was diluted with an equal volume of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, collected on nitrocellulose using a slot-blot apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments), and immunostained using affinity-purified antiserum described by Grimes et al.

Genet. 1989; 27: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by digestion with SalI andBamHI and ligation of this fragment into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pMK195 (15Overvoorde P.J. Frommer W.B. Grimes H.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The construct was confirmed by restriction digests. Two forms of the SBP were tested as well. A SBP with its C terminus truncated was excised from pSBP usingXhoI and XbaI sites, and this fragment was ligated into the XbaI and XhoI sites of pMK195. This construct resulted in the deletion of 80 amino acids from the C terminus. A full-length SBP was excised from pSBP using SalI and PstI and ligated into the PstI andXhoI sites of pMK195. The truncated form was used in a previous study (15Overvoorde P.J. Frommer W.B. Grimes H.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). susy7/ura3 yeast (15Overvoorde P.J. Frommer W.B. Grimes H.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). To characterize the putative transformants, DNA was isolated (32Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar) and analyzed either by Southern blot analysis (31Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar) or by being electroporated into XL-I BlueE. coli. Plasmid DNA from transformed E. colicolonies growing on solidified Luria broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was isolated (31Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar) and used to confirm the structure of the re-isolated shuttle vectors by restriction digests. The yeast strain termed OG2 contains the C-terminal truncated SBP, whereas CG1 contains the full-length SBP. Both of these constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Colonies containing the appropriate vectors were grown to anA 600 of 0.5–1.0 in liquid minimal medium supplemented with His, Trp (ura dropout). After harvesting by centrifugation, the cells were washed twice with 25 mmMes-KOH buffer, pH 5.5, weighed, and resuspended in the same buffer to a density of 30–50 mg of cells/ml. [14C]Sucrose uptake assays were performed as described by Overvoorde et al.(15Overvoorde P.J. Frommer W.B. Grimes H.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was assayed with the bicinchoninic acid reagent according to the manufacturer's directions (Pierce). Polyacrylamide gels were run according to Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), except that a 7.5–15% acrylamide gradient was used with an accompanying 7.5–15% glycerol gradient. To determine the mobility of the SBP under nonreducing conditions, the samples were solubilized in sample buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol but containing SDS and were not heated before loading. Gels were stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For immunostaining, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted to nitrocellulose (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) and immunodecorated using affinity-purified anti-SBP antisera as described by Grimes et al. (21Grimes H.D. Overvoorde P.J. Ripp K.G. Franceschi V.R. Hitz W.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1561-1574PubMed Google Scholar). Color development was performed using ECL according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Corp.). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the SBP shows that it lacks similarity with any other known transport protein identified from other species (21Grimes H.D. Overvoorde P.J. Ripp K.G. Franceschi V.R. Hitz W.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1561-1574PubMed Google Scholar). Searches of the GenBankTM data base for SBP homologues, however, reveal that the SBP shares 44–61% similarity and 20–37% identity with the vicilin-like seed storage proteins (Fig. 1). The vicilin-like family of proteins shares several conserved features, and a detailed comparison of the SBP sequence with other members of this family highlights the close relationship of the SBP with this group of polypeptides. Seed storage proteins typically contain a hydrophobic signal sequence that targets the newly synthesized polypeptides to the endoplasmic reticulum where the protein undergoes a variety of modifications, including the proteolytic removal of the signal sequence, glycosylation, and sorting for transit through the remainder of the secretory pathway. Similarly, the SBP contains a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids at its N terminus that may function as a signal sequence. Microsequencing of the N terminus of the mature SBP (21Grimes H.D. Overvoorde P.J. Ripp K.G. Franceschi V.R. Hitz W.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1561-1574PubMed Google Scholar), however, shows that if this hydrophobic domain is removed, the site of processing (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1) is different from the highly conserved site of processing shared by both vicilin- and legumin-like proteins (indicated by a down arrow in Fig.1; Ref. 4Borroto K. Dure III, L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 8: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The vicilin-like proteins can be roughly grouped into two size classes depending on the length of a variable highly charged segment that follows the hydrophobic N terminus (35Dure III, L. New Biol. 1990; 2: 487-493PubMed Google Scholar). Storage proteins containing this hydrophilic segment (which ranges in size from 90 to 183 residues) are approximately 70 kDa, whereas those lacking this region are approximately 50 kDa. Although considerably smaller (73 residues) than the 70-kDa proteins, the SBP contains a similar hydrophilic segment that is rich in charged amino acids, especially Glu and Arg (Fig. 1; Ref. 21Grimes H.D. Overvoorde P.J. Ripp K.G. Franceschi V.R. Hitz W.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1561-1574PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the CXXXC motif that is repeated six times in this portion of the cotton vicilin and twice in the vicilin-like storage proteins of cocoa, barley, soybean, wheat, and maize is also present twice in the SBP sequence (residues 43–47 and 61–65 using SBP numbering in Fig. 1; Refs. 28Kriz A.L. Wallace M.S. Paiva R. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1990; 92: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 35Dure III, L. New Biol. 1990; 2: 487-493PubMed Google Scholar, 36Braun H. Czihal A. Shutov A.D. Bäumlein H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37McHenry L. Fritz P.J. Plant Mol.

Thus, the SBP shares both the charged hydrophilic domain and the conserved CXXXC motif within this domain with other members of the vicilin-like proteins. A third shared feature of the SBP with the vicilin-like proteins is the presence of a repeated sequence that is thought to have arisen through the duplication of a primordial gene (5Shutov A.D. Kakhovskaya I.A. Braun H. Bäumlein H. Müntz K. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Gibbs P.E.M. Strongin K.B. McPherson A. Mol. Biol.

Narayana V.L. Neilsen N.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of both phaseolin and canavalin, vicilin-like proteins from Phaseolus vulgaris andCanavalia ensiformis, respectively, demonstrates that this duplicated sequence forms the basis for the symmetrically reiterated Swiss roll domain structure (7Lawrence M.C. Suzuki E. Varghese J.N. Davis P.C. van Donkelaar A. Tulloch P.A. Colman P.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Lawrence M.C. Izard T. Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J.

Alignment of the SBP sequence with phaseolin and canavalin shows that the SBP contains a similar internal repeat (residues 117–299 and 310–509; Fig. 1). Lawrence et al. (8Lawrence M.C. Izard T. Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 748-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) identified 26 strictly conserved residues present in all members of the vicilin-like protein family (indicated by a black circle under the sequences in Fig. 1). Of these 26 residues, 23 (88%) are also present in the SBP sequence (Fig. 1). Analysis of these conserved residues in the context of the known three-dimensional structures demonstrates their importance in maintaining the overall structure and intramonomer contacts (8Lawrence M.C. Izard T. Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 748-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). As such, the SBP appears likely to contain similar tertiary motifs and to be organized in similar three-dimensional structures. Two potentially significant departures from this conservation are the substitution of Ile for Pro at position 361 of the SBP (36Braun H. Czihal A. Shutov A.D. Bäumlein H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the substitution of Ala for Pro at position 157 of the SBP. Both of these Pro residues result in a β bulge forming in the respective β sheets, and these β bulges are postulated to be important in mediating oligomeric formation (10Ko T.-P. Ng J.D. McPherson A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1993; 101: 729-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Within the vicilin-like sequence, there are segments that highlight the relatedness of the reiterated motif (10Ko T.-P. Ng J.D. McPherson A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1993; 101: 729-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For instance, residues 173–181 (canavalin numbering) in the N-terminal domain of canavalin share 67% similarity (44% identity) with its C-terminal counterpart, residues 375–383 (10Ko T.-P. Ng J.D. McPherson A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1993; 101: 729-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Such similarity and that of adjoining regions support the hypothesis that these domains have arisen by tandem duplication of a smaller ancestral protein (5Shutov A.D. Kakhovskaya I.A. Braun H. Bäumlein H. Müntz K. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Gibbs P.E.M. Strongin K.B. McPherson A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1989; 6: 614-623PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lawrence M.C. Suzuki E. Varghese J.N. Davis P.C. van Donkelaar A. Tulloch P.A. Colman P.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Lawrence M.C. Izard T. Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 748-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Ng J.D. Ko T.-P. McPherson A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1993; 101: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Ko T.-P. Ng J.D. McPherson A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1993; 101: 729-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SBP contains residues that are conserved between its two domains that are not conserved in other vicilin-like sequences (e.g.Phe-239 and Gly-243 (SBP numbering) in the N-terminal domain are found in the same register at positions 449 and 453, respectively, as in the C-terminal domain). The significance of these observations for inferring the evolutionary relationship of the SBP and other proteins that contain vestiges of this repeated domain remains unclear. An additional conserved feature of the vicilin-like proteins is the LQRF motif at positions 70–73 of the canavalin sequence and positions 60–63 of the phaseolin sequence. This LQ(R/K)F motif is similar to the yeast carboxypeptidase Y vacuolar targeting signal and has been proposed to function as a vacuolar targeting motif in the vicilin-like proteins as well (9Ng J.D. Ko T.-P. McPherson A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1993; 101: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This region in the SBP is LKKF, which may partially explain the targeting of the SBP to the plasma membrane rather than vacuoles or protein storage bodies. β-Conglycinins are vicilin-like storage proteins found in soybean cotyledons (14Doyle J.J.

Planta. 1981; 153: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The expression, processing, localization, and hydrolysis during germination of these storage proteins are well defined (14Doyle J.J. Schuler M.A. Godette W.D. Zenger V. Beachy R.N. Slightom J.L. J.

However, regulation of agrin gene expression and pre-mRNA splicing, important in determining the biological actions of agrin, is not well understood. To begin to identify mechanisms controlling agrin expression, quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques were used to analyze the effect of growth factors on the expression of agrin mRNA isoforms in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Agrin transcripts in untreated cells lacked inserts in the Y and Z sites (agriny0z0), encoding agrin isoforms with low acetylcholine receptor aggregating activity and a primarily non-neuronal tissue distribution. Transcripts encoding isoforms with high aggregating activity and neuronal tissue distribution (agriny4z8, agriny4z11, and agriny4z19) were not detected. Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) caused a significant increase in total agrin mRNA. In contrast, exposure to epidermal growth factor had no effect. Analysis of alternative splicing of agrin mRNA revealed that NGF elicited a specific increase in agriny4 and agrinz8 mRNAs that did not occur in the presence of epidermal growth factor, insulin, dexamethasone, or retinoic acid. Analysis of PC12 sublines stably overexpressing a dominant inhibitory form of p21 Ras indicated that NGF induced changes in levels of agrin mRNA and alternative splicing required Ras activity. The results show that NGF can influence important aspects of neuronal differentiation by regulating alternative splicing.

Agrin is an extracellular matrix protein that plays a key role in directing the formation and maintenance of the postsynaptic apparatus of the neuromuscular junction. Consistent with this hypothesis, agrin is expressed by embryonic and adult motor neurons in vivoand induces clustering of AChR 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; NGF, nerve growth factor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RT, reverse transcription; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. on muscle fibers in cell culture (reviewed in Ref. 1Bowe M.A. Fallon J.F.

In addition, antibodies against agrin block motor nerve-induced clustering of AChR on cultured muscle cells (2Reist N.E. Werle M.J. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 865-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and the accumulation of AChR at developing neuromuscular junctions is disrupted in agrin-deficient mice (3Gautam M.

Agrin is also expressed in many populations of neurons throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems (4Thomas W.S. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Ma E. Morgan R. Godfrey E.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2943-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6O'Connor L.T. Lauterborn J.C.

However, agrin mRNA and/or protein has been detected in non-neuronal cells within the nervous system (7Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. McMahan U.J.

Neurosci. 1995; 18: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), suggests that agrin may serve functions in addition to those defined at the neuromuscular junction. The results of studies showing that agrin is a potent protease inhibitor (12Biroc S.L. Payan D.G. Fisher J.M. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 75: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), binds to neural cell adhesion molecules (13Tsen G. Halfter W. Kroger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 1365-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) further support this possibility. Agrin mRNA levels in brain, spinal cord, parasympathetic ganglia, and skeletal muscle undergo dramatic changes during development (4Thomas W.S. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H.

Subsequent levels of expression are not necessarily static because agrin mRNA levels in several regions of the brain are altered by seizures (17O'Connor L.T. Lauterborn J.C. Smith M.A. Gall C.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, although agrin is encoded by a single gene, alternative splicing of agrin pre-mRNA gives rise to multiple protein isoforms that differ in their tissue distribution and biological activity. In particular, two sites of alternative splicing in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein, referred to in the rat gene as Y and Z (15Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H.

Optional exclusion of sequences encoding 4 amino acids at the Y site and 8 and 11 amino acids at the Z site result in mRNAs encoding agrin proteins with unique functional properties and tissue-specific patterns of expression. For example, forms of agrin lacking inserts at the both Y and Z sites (agriny0z0) are unable to induce clustering of AChR (7Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. McMahan U.J.

In contrast, agrin proteins containing the 4-amino acid insert at the Y site and either one or both of the 8 and 11 amino acid inserts at the Z site (agriny4z8, agriny4z11, and agriny4z19) are potent inducers of AChR aggregates (7Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K.

Despite the importance of agrin gene expression as a determinant of agrin function during development and in different tissues, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate it. Changes in gene expression underlying the formation and maintenance of chemical synapses are coordinated through signals exchanged between neurons and the structures they innervate. Within this scheme, agrin acts as an anterograde signal that triggers changes in the postsynaptic cell. Several lines of evidence suggest that neuronal agrin gene expression may in turn be influenced by factors produced by or associated with target tissues. For example, total agrin mRNA levels in the ciliary ganglion increase dramatically following contact between ganglionic neurons and their targets in the eye and decrease when the connection with their target tissues is interrupted by axotomy (4Thomas W.S. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Thomas W.S. Jacob M.H. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in the pattern of alternatively spliced agrin mRNAs in ciliary ganglion neurons during development and following axotomy suggest that alternative splicing of agrin mRNA may be similarly target-dependent (4Thomas W.S. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Thomas W.S. Jacob M.H. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although similar developmental changes in agrin expression have been reported throughout the nervous system (5Ma E. Morgan R. Godfrey E.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2943-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H.

Morgan R. Godfrey E.W. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 26: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying these changes are not known. Among the target-associated factors having an important influence on neuronal development are soluble growth factors. In particular, the neurotrophins, a family of neurotrophic factors that includes NGF, influence neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation in vitro and in vivo (for review see Refs. 22Barde Y.-A. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1525-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar, 23Chao M.V. Neuron. 1992; 9: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 24Mendell L.M.

Neurotrophins also affect the development of synaptic connections and the expression of synaptic proteins and modulate synaptic function (reviewed in Ref. 26Lo D.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 979-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Whether neurotrophins have effects on agrin gene expression is unknown, although it is intriguing that the seizure-induced changes in agrin mRNA in rat hippocampus (17O'Connor L.T. Lauterborn J.C. Smith M.A. Gall C.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) follow seizure-induced changes in neurotrophin gene expression that also occur there (27Isackson P.J. Huntsman M. Murray K.D. Gall C.M. Neuron. 1991; 6: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 28Lauterborn J.C. Isackson P.J. Gall C.M. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 125: 22-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To begin to identify mechanisms regulating agrin gene expression, the ability of various growth factors to influence agrin mRNA levels was analyzed in the PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line. PC12 cells have been widely used to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal differentiation and the actions of growth factors. For example, upon activation of the TrkA receptor by NGF, PC12 cells adopt a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype that results from the activation of a variety of signaling pathways and a spectrum of changes in protein phosphorylation and gene expression (for review see Refs. 29Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar, 30Guroff G. Bottenstein J.E. Sato G. Cell Culture in the Neurosciences.

Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that NGF selectively regulates both the level of total agrin mRNA and the pattern of alternative splicing of agrin mRNA in PC12 cells and does so in a manner that requires Ras activity, providing the first insight into the mechanisms governing agrin gene expression. Cells were maintained in a humidified CO2 environment in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon Labware, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.45% glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Culture medium for the 17.2 and 17.26 sublines (kindly supplied by G. Cooper, Dana Farber Institute, Boston, MA) and the protein kinase A-deficient 123.7 subline (kindly supplied by J. Wagner, Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY) also contained 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). In cases where 100 ng/ml 7S NGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Plattsburg, NY), 100 ng/ml EGF (Upstate Biotechnology), or 300 nm insulin (Sigma) were included, fresh growth factor was added every other day when the medium was changed. Total cellular RNA was isolated from dishes containing approximately 106 PC12 cells, using the method of Chirgwin et al. (33Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). The molar concentration of agrin mRNA in the RNA samples was determined by competitive PCR, as in our previous studies (4Thomas W.S. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Thomas W.S. Jacob M.H. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, a competing template was generated by subcloning a PCR fragment corresponding to nucleotides 4516–4820 of the published rat agrin gene sequence (34Rupp F. Payan D.G. Magill-Solc C. Cowan D.M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 811-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and common to all agrin isoforms into the plasmid vector pGEM-T (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). This agrin DNA fragment contained a uniqueKpnI restriction site at position 4739 that was subsequently mutated to a BamHI site by recombinant PCR (35Higuchi R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 16: 7351-7367Crossref Scopus (2104) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pGEM-T to yield the competing template pRABam. For competitive PCR, cDNA from 50 ng of total RNA was mixed with different amounts (0.05–10 pg) of pRABam (diluted in Tris/EDTA buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml of yeast tRNA) and coamplified in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) for 40 cycles using an annealing temperature of 60 °C and the F25/B12 primer pair (see list below). Reaction products were labeled by inclusion of ∼2 × 105 cpm of32P-labeled forward primer. Subsequently, 2 μl of each reaction was subject to overdigestion with BamHI, and the products were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Product yields from endogenous and competing templates were determined by analysis on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and the point of equivalence was determined by linear estimation. The relative abundance of alternatively spliced agrin mRNAs was determined by PCR using aliquots of cDNA synthesized from 100–200 ng of total RNA. Reaction conditions were as described in our previous studies (6O'Connor L.T. Lauterborn J.C. Gall C.M. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were radiolabeled by inclusion of ∼2 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled forward primer in the reaction mixture, separated by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels, and the relative abundance determined by analysis of the gel with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To investigate the pattern of alternative splicing at either the Y or Z sites, samples were subjected to a single round of amplification (35 cycles) using oligonucleotide primers F111/B112 or F24/B2 flanking the Y and Z sites, respectively (18Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To examine alternative splicing in the Z region of agrin transcripts containing the 4-amino acid insert at the Y site, two rounds of amplification were performed using nested primers. During the first round of amplification the forward primer F110, whose 3′-end consisted of the 12-base pair sequence of the 4-amino acid insert, was used in combination with the reverse primer B6, to specifically amplify agriny4 mRNAs. Subsequently, first round PCR products were diluted 1000-fold and reamplified using the F24/B2 primer combination flanking the Z region. Primers used in the study are listed below with the corresponding location in the published rat agrin cDNA (34Rupp F. Payan D.G. Magill-Solc C. Cowan D.M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 811-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) shown in parentheses: F25, 5′-TGTGGAGACCATCCGTGCTTAC-3′ (4516–4537); B12, 5′-TTCAGTTCCAGGTAGGAGAAGCC-3′ (4820–4798); F111, 5′-TGGGTCAGGGTATTCCTGGAA-3′ (5044– 5064); B112, 5′-AGGTTGAGCATGGTGTGCGG-3′ (5143–5162); F24, 5′-AGTCAGTGGGGGACCTAGAAACAC-3′ (5462–5485); B2, 5′-AAGCTCAGTTCAAAGTGGTTGCTC-3′ (5576–5553); F110, 5′-GAATCTCCGAAATCCCGCAAG-3′ (5119–5139); and B6, 5′-TGGTGTTGACCTTCACAGTGGAG3′ (5791–5769). The statistical significance of the differences in samples from different experimental conditions was determined using ANOVA. Differences between control untreated cells and cells treated with growth factors was determined using Student'st test. All statistical analyses were performed on the raw data. Data presented in the text and figures represent the means ± S.E. In response to NGF, PC12 cells stop dividing and differentiate, acquiring characteristics of sympathetic neurons. To determine whether this neuronal differentiation included changes in agrin gene expression, competitive PCR was used to compare the molar concentration of total agrin mRNA in PC12 cells maintained in the presence or the absence of 100 ng/ml NGF. Analysis of two different sublines of wild type PC12 cells revealed that NGF caused a significant increase (p < 0.01, ANOVA) in total agrin mRNA, with the average level of expression in PC12 cells treated with NGF for 7 days more than 2.5 times that in untreated cells (Fig.1; p < 0.02, t test). To determine whether the increase in agrin mRNA was a general response to growth factors simply reflecting hypertrophy of the cells or instead was associated with their neuronal differentiation and specific actions of NGF, the influence of EGF on agrin mRNA expression in PC12 cells was also determined. Although EGF is similar to NGF in that both exert their effects through specific transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, their biological effects are in sharp contrast, because EGF promotes the growth and proliferation of PC12 cells (36Chao M.V. Cell. 1992; 68: 995-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). As evidenced by increases in c-fos mRNA, ornithine decarboxylase activity, and protein phosphorylation detected in parallel studies of these cells (37Fanger G.R. Jones J.R. Maue R.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 202-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the two independent sublines of wild type PC12 cells analyzed responded to EGF. However, EGF had no detectable effect on the level of agrin mRNA in these sublines, even after treatment for 7 days (Fig. 1). This suggests that the increase in agrin mRNA is among the specific responses to NGF associated with the neuronal differentiation of these cells. Alternative splicing, particularly the optional inclusion of 8- and 11-amino acid exons in the Z site, is an important mechanism regulating both cell-specific and developmental patterns of agrin gene expression. Accordingly, oligonucleotide primers flanking the Z site were used to examine the pattern of expression of alternatively spliced agrin transcripts in wild type PC12 cells maintained in the presence or the absence of growth factors. As shown in an autoradiogram from a representative experiment (Fig. 2 A), based on their electrophoretic mobility and confirmed by sequencing, PCR products representing two different agrin isoforms were amplified from treated and untreated cells. Consistent with previous analyses of agrin gene expression in vivo (6O'Connor L.T. Lauterborn J.C. Gall C.M. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Li, Z., Massengill, J. L., O'Dowd, D. K., and Smith, M. A. (1997)Neuroscience, in press.Google Scholar), transcripts lacking both exons at the Z site (agrinz0) were always the most abundant isoform detected. More striking, however, was the increase in the relative abundance of agrinz8 transcripts in response to NGF. This increase appeared to be selective, because agrinz11 and agrinz19 mRNA remained below the limit of detection (Fig. 2 A). Quantitative analysis of two different sublines of wild type PC12 cells confirmed that there was a significant increase in agrinz8 mRNA (p < 0.001, ANOVA), with the relative abundance more than 12-fold greater (p < 0.03, t test) in NGF-treated versus untreated cells (Fig. 2 B). The increase in agrinz8 mRNA was a relatively late response to NGF, most noticeable in cells that had been treated for 5–7 days. Similar to the change in total agrin mRNA, the change in the pattern of agrin mRNA isoforms appeared to be specific to NGF. For example, less than a 2-fold increase in the relative abundance of agrinz8 mRNA was observed following treatment with a saturating concentration of EGF, and no effect was produced by insulin (Fig. 3), despite the fact that in a parallel study (37Fanger G.R. Jones J.R. Maue R.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 202-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) these two factors had clearly detectable effects on the cells. Dexamethasone and retinoic acid also failed to change agrinz8 mRNA levels (data not shown).Figure 2NGF selectively increases agrinz8mRNA expression in PC12 cells.

Molecular size markers (M) indicating the location of the predicted PCR products for the different agrin mRNA isoforms were generated when plasmids containing agrin cDNAs with different combinations of inserts were used as templates. In samples from cells that were untreated (−) or treated with NGF for 1–7 days, PCR products representing agrinz0 mRNA and agrinz8 mRNA are visible, and products representing agrinz11 mRNA and agrin z19 mRNA are not detected (a faint band intermediate to the agrinz11 and agrinz19 products is an artifact present in some, but not all, experiments).

As shown (Fig.4), there was a significant increase (agrinz8, p < 0.001; agrinz0,p < 0.01, ANOVA) in the molar concentrations of both transcripts. However, the level of agrinz0 mRNA increased approximately 2.5-fold (p < 0.02,t test) upon treatment of the cells with NGF for 7 days (Fig. 4 A), similar to the increase in total agrin mRNA levels. In contrast, the increase in the level of agrinz8mRNA was much more dramatic, increasing 35-fold (p< 0.003, t test) during the same time period (Fig.4 B). Inclusion of a 4-amino acid exon at the Y site is necessary for normal AChR aggregating activity of agrin and occurs only in neural tissues. Therefore it was of particular interest to analyze the pattern of agrin mRNA splicing at this site. Oligonucleotide primers flanking the Y site were used to compare the pattern of expression of alternatively spliced agrin transcripts in PC12 cells maintained in the presence or the absence of growth factors. In the absence of added growth factors (Fig. 5 A), only agriny0 mRNA was detected, with agriny4 mRNA at or below the level of detection. However, in response to NGF the relative abundance of agriny4 transcripts increased 11-fold over background (p < 0.001, t test), comparable with the increase in relative abundance of agrinz8 mRNA. Again, this induction was specific to NGF, because treatment with EGF for 7 days failed to induce the appearance of agriny4 mRNA (Fig. 5 A). Previous studies have shown that alternative splicing at the Y and Z sites are coordinated such that only mRNAs containing the 4-amino acid insert at the Y site can include the 8- and/or 11-amino acid inserts at the Z site (15Hoch W.

https://openalex.org/W2098325722,"Tissue-restricted POU domain transcription factors, which bind octamer or octamer-like gene sequences, play roles in cellular differentiation and the development of several organs. We have previously identified a POU domain gene, Skn-1a/i, expressed primarily in epidermis, that encodes at least two products through alternative splicing. One of these, Skn-1a, acts as a transcriptional activator, and the other, Skn-1i, contains an inhibitory domain in the NH2 terminus, which prevents DNA-binding in vitro and transcriptional activationin vivo. We now demonstrate that when Skn-1i is expressed in eukaryotic cells it can bind to an octamer site, suggesting thatin vivo cellular factors modulate the activity of the inhibitory domain to permit DNA-binding. Yet the inhibitory domain does not allow transactivation by Skn-1i or by a heterologous transactivator containing this domain in cis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Skn-1a, Tst-1, and Oct-1 are the major octamer-binding proteins in epidermis. Since Skn-1a is primarily expressed in suprabasal cells of the epidermis, we have tested its possible role in the regulation of epidermal papillomaviruses. In transient transfection assays, Skn-1a and Tst-1 can activate the long control region of the epidermis-specific human papillomavirus 1A (HPV-1A). Consistent with these in vivo transcription data, in vitro DNA binding studies identify three octamer-like sites, which are capable of binding Skn-1a, in the HPV-1A long control region. Mutations of all three octamer-like sites prevent transactivation by Skn-1a in transient transfection assays. Taken together, these results provide evidence that Skn-1a and Tst-1 may provide a molecular link between HPV gene expression and epidermal differentiation.

During midgestation in mammals, the embryo is enclosed by a cellular bilayer composed of a basal layer of somatic ectoderm, which is covered by distinct epithelial cells referred to as periderm. While periderm is later shed, somatic ectoderm has several distinct fates in the mature organism. These fates include mammary epithelium, teeth, epidermis, and epidermal appendages such as hair, nails, and sweat glands (1Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Epidermis, which forms relatively late in embryogenesis, is made of a single layer of proliferating basal keratinocytes and several layers of postmitotic suprabasal cells. The basal keratinocytes express a pair of keratins, K5 and K14, but, concomitant with departure from the basal layer, they exit the cell cycle, suppress expression of K5 and K14, and induce expression of another keratin pair, K1 and K10. As keratinocytes move outward to the surface of the skin, proteins required for formation of a cornified cell envelope are induced. These cells subsequently undergo programmed cell death to form the cornified layer of the epidermis. This differentiation process, first initiated during embryogenesis, continues throughout life with cell proliferation in the basal layer balanced by cell death and eventual shedding of the stratum corneum (2Fuchs E. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 123-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) 1The abbreviations used are: HPV, human papillomavirus; LCR, long control region; bp, base pair(s); TEF, thyrotrope embryonic factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus. are a family of small DNA viruses that selectively infect epithelial tissues and replicate in the nucleus of cells undergoing differentiation (3Howley, P. M. (1991) Cancer Res. , 51, Suppl. 18, 5019–5022.Google Scholar). Over 70 types of HPVs have been identified, with each type demonstrating a characteristic tissue specificity. HPV-1 and -2 primarily infect epidermal keratinocytes, causing palmoplantar warts and verrucose warts in other regions of the skin, respectively. In contrast, HPV-16 and -18 primarily infect the genitourinary epithelium and have been implicated as the main etiologic factor in cervical cancer (3Howley, P. M. (1991) Cancer Res. , 51, Suppl. 18, 5019–5022.Google Scholar). The genomic organization of all HPVs is remarkably similar with all open reading frames located on one strand of viral DNA. The approximately 10 expressed viral genes can be divided into early (E) and late (L) genes. The early genes include E1, which is involved in replication, and E2, which regulates transcription, as well as E6 and E7, which are responsible for cellular transformation by means of interactions with p53 and Rb proteins. The late genes L1 and L2 encode for capsid proteins. Between the L2 and E6 genes there is long region in all HPVs, referred to as the long control region (LCR), which contains no open reading frames. A characteristic feature of all these viruses is the tissue specificity of their infection and the fact that productive infections are dependent on an advanced stage of differentiation of the infected epithelial tissues. In this respect, gene expression and replication of HPV-1 and -2 correlate with expression of markers of epidermal differentiation, such as cytokeratins 1 and 10. In fact, the papillomaviruses may use the same regulatory mechanisms for transcription and replication as the cell uses for differentiation (4Cheng S. Schmidt-Grimminger D.C. Murant T. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2335-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). While the molecular mechanisms responsible for skin development remain unclear, they probably involve complex interactions between external regulators with convergence on nuclear proteins that ultimately regulate gene transcription. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the HMG domain transcription factor LEF-1 is required for development of several organs requiring inductive epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in somatic ectoderm, including teeth, mammary glands, whiskers, and hair (5Zhou P.

A nuclear zinc finger protein, basonuclein, that is expressed in undifferentiated proliferating keratinocytes is likely to be a transcriptional regulator (7Tseng H. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Identification of the epidermis-restricted POU domain geneSkin-1a/i (Skn-1a/i; also referred to asEpoc and Oct-11) suggested a candidate for a transcription factor involved in epidermal differentiation (21Goldsborough A.S.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that other tissue-restricted POU domain genes have been shown to be important for cellular differentiation in other organ systems (24Rosenfeld M.G. Bach I.

Although expression has been described in the stromal cell of the thymus and in the antrum of the stomach (23Yukawa K. Yasui T. Yamamoto A. Shiku H. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), expression of the Skn-1a/i gene is essentially limited to interfollicular epidermis and cortical cells of the hair. Second, the Skn-1a/i gene is activated in somatic ectoderm at a time that corresponds with formation of epidermis and becomes primarily localized to the differentiating suprabasal layer. Finally, Skn-1a can activate transcription of the differentiation-specific K10 and SPRR2A promoters (22Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell.

Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One, Skn-1i, cloned from an anterior pituitary cDNA library, contains an NH2-terminal sequence that inhibits DNA bindingin vitro and prevents transactivation in vivo. The inhibitory domain of Skn-1i is capable of transferring inhibition to unrelated DNA-binding proteins. Furthermore, despite the apparent lack of DNA-binding by Skn-1i, it can interfere with transactivation by Oct-1 and Skn-1a on octamer-containing transcription units. In the other form, Skn-1a, the inhibitory domain is replaced by a distinct sequence; this form binds octamer sites in vitroand acts as a transcriptional activator. While both forms have been found in skin by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, their relative levels are unknown. In this paper, we demonstrate that the major octamer-binding proteins in skin are Skn-1a, Oct-1, and Tst-1. We show that Skn-1i, which appears to be expressed at a relatively low level in normal skin, can bind octamer sites in eukaryotic cell extracts yet is incapable of transactivation. Both Skn-1a and Tst-1 can activate the E6 promoter of HPV-1A via octamer DNA-binding sites. Thus, the differentiation-related POU domain factors Skn-1a and Tst-1 may provide a molecular link between epidermal differentiation and efficient papillomavirus gene expression. Nuclear extracts from CV-1 cells were prepared according to the method described by Schreiber et al. (1989) (26Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Cells were washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from two 35-mm plates in 300 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). After remaining on ice for 5–10 min. 15 μl of 20% Nonidet P-40 was added followed by vortexing for 10 s. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge to separate nuclei from cytosol. After removing the cytoplasmic extract, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50–100 μl of buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 400 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors. The sample was gently rotated for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. The supernatant was frozen in 10% glycerol. Nuclear extracts from neonatal mouse skin were made using modification of the same method in which 100–500 mg of tissue were dissected into small pieces followed by homogenization in buffer A using a Dounce homogenizer. Human adult skin was obtained using a dermatome set at 0.2–0.4 mm. The sample was cut into small pieces and incubated in the presence of trypsin for 1 h at 37 °C. After pipetting to dissociate cells, the method described above was used to isolate nuclear extracts. 0.5–5.0 μl of nuclear extracts was used in the gel mobility shift assay as described previously (22Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The sequence of oligonucleotide binding sites used in gel mobility shift assays is as follows: 5′-AAGGGGATCCCTGATTTGCATATGAAGGATAC-3′ (O+H−; octamer sequence is underlined); 5′-GATCCTATTTTATGTAAATACATGCCTACTTATACTAATGTAAATCTTA-3′ (HPV sites 1 and 2; octamer-like sequences are underlined); and 5′-GATCTGATTGTGTGTTATTTTCCTGCAATATGCAATAAAAGTGAG-3′ (HPV site 3; octamer-like sequence is underlined). In vitro translated and bacterially expressed proteins were prepared as described previously (22Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). DNA-binding sites for gel mobility shifts were labeled using polynucleotide kinase. Footprint assays were performed as described previously (27Brenowitz M. Senear D. Kingston R. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 12.4.1-12.4.16Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from mouse and rat skin as described previously (28Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Pearse R.V., II Jenne K. Sugarman J. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23390-23398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After gel electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized to32P-labeled DNA fragments. For Northern blots, we used a Skn-1a probe that is 350 bp long starting at the starting codon and a Skn-1i probe that is 380 bp, containing mainly 5′-untranslated sequence. These probes contain 10 bp of common sequence at the 3′-end. RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (28Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Pearse R.V., II Jenne K. Sugarman J. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23390-23398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from rat neonatal skin. The cRNA probe for Skn-1a extends from the 5′-end of the Skn-1a cDNA to the HindIII site in the NH2 terminus, resulting in a protected fragment of 520 bp; the total length of the probe, including vector sequences, is 563 bp. The cRNA probe for Skn-1i extends from the 5′-end of the Skn-1i cDNA to the PstI site in the NH2 terminus, resulting in a protected fragment of 370 bp; the total length of the probe is 445 bp. An equivalent amount of probe and RNA was used for all hybridization reactions. Three protein preparations, Δ60 Skn-1i (antiserum 813), Δ60 NH2 terminus of Skn-1i with the 5′-part of the POU domain (antiserum 764), and the COOH terminus of Skn-1a/i (antiserum 812), were used for immunization. Constructs encoding these proteins were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in bacteria. After purification by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography and size fractionation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, gel slices containing these proteins were injected into rabbits according to standard protocols to generate antisera. The Tst-1 antisera has been previously described (29Bermingham Jr., J.R. Scherer S.S. O'Donnell S.O. Arroyo E. Kalla K.A. Powell F.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Human papillomavirus 1A DNA was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The LCR, encompassing nucleotides 3395–4370, was isolated using PCR and cloned directionally into the luciferase reporter plasmid GeneLight (Promega), using the restriction sites Bgl2 andHindIII. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for amplifying the LCR were as follows: 5′-ATATAGATCTTAGTATATATTATATATAACTATATTT-3′ (5′-end) and 5′-ATATAAGCTTTGTGCAGAGTCTTACCTGTGTATTT-3′ (3′-end). The 5′-end of the LCR was arbitrarily assigned the number −974, and the 3′-end was assigned +1. The AvrII site at nucleotide 4314 was used to create the reporter plasmid −56 HPV-1A LCR, which contains the minimal E6 promoter. The RsaI restriction sites located at nucleotides 3689, 3957, and 4179, were used to create the fragments of the LCR used for cloning into reporter plasmids and for DNA-binding studies. −60 K10 luciferase contains the minimal K10 promoter upstream of luciferase in GeneLight. The following oligonucleotides were used to mutagenize the Skn-1a binding sites HPV site 1, HPV site 2, and HPV site 3: 5′-ATACTAATGGGAATCTTACAT-3′, 5′-GACTATTTTATGGGAATACATGCC-3′, and 5′-TCACTTTTATCCCATATTGCAGGA-3′, respectively (altered nucleotides are underlined). Expression plasmids have been previously described (22Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G.

Transient transfection assays were performed as described previously, using 6 μg of reporter plasmid and 4 μg of expression plasmid per duplicate 35-mm tissue culture dish (22Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To identify the octamer-binding proteins in epidermis, we isolated nuclear extracts from neonatal mouse skin. This extract was incubated with a32P-labeled octamer site (O+H−) and subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis in the gel mobility shift assay. Two major complexes are observed in skin nuclear extracts (Fig.1 A, lanes 10–16), a slow migrating complex, which is also found in HeLa cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–9), and a fast migrating complex, which is unique to skin. The slower complex is consistent with the ubiquitous POU domain factor Oct-1 and is disrupted by Oct-1 antisera (data not shown). The fast migrating complex is largely disrupted by two different Skn-1a/i antisera (Fig. 1 A,lanes 11 and 13) and supershifted by a third Skn-1a/i antiserum, while a Tst-1 antiserum only has a minor effect on this complex (Fig. 1 A, lane 16). The Skn-1a/i and Tst-1 antisera are specific because they selectively disrupt the binding of bacterially expressed truncated Skn-1a/i protein (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–3) and in vitrotranslated Tst-1 protein (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–6), respectively, and none of the antisera recognize the highly related Oct-1 factor (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–9). Nuclear extracts from human skin also exhibit two major octamer-binding complexes (Fig. 1 B). Both complexes are disrupted by including excess unlabeled octamer DNA-binding site (Fig.1 B, lane 2) and are unaffected by Oct-2 antisera (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). In contrast to the slowly migrating Oct-1 complex, the faster migrating complex is partially disrupted by antisera against Skn-1a/i (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) and Tst-1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). Since no Skn-1a/i or Tst-1 transcripts are found in the dermis (28Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Pearse R.V., II Jenne K. Sugarman J. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23390-23398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Faus I. Hsu H.J. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3263-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), these proteins must originate from the epidermal keratinocytes. We conclude that Skn-1a and Tst-1 constitute the main octamer binding activity in epidermis, in addition to the ubiquitous POU domain factor, Oct-1, and that this pattern of expression is conserved from mice to humans. Using specific oligonucleotides in combination with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we have demonstrated both Skn-1a and Skn-1i transcripts in skin tissues from rats and mice (data not shown). To estimate the relative levels of Skn-1a and Skn-1i transcripts in epidermis, we isolated poly(A)+ RNA from neonatal mouse and rat skin. 32P-Labeled cRNA probes that are specific for Skn-1a and Skn-1i were used in RNase protection assays with 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from rat neonatal skin or yeast tRNA as a negative control (Fig. 2 A). While protected fragments were observed with both probes (indicated witharrows in Fig. 2 A), the Skn-1a transcript is clearly expressed at a higher level.Figure 5Localization of Skn-1a binding sites in the HPV-1A LCR. A, The HPV-1A LCR was isolated and treated with the restriction endonuclease RsaI to generate the indicated fragments. After dephosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase, these fragments were 32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and incubated with increasing amounts of bacterial extract containing Δ60Skn-1i. Bound (B) and free complexes (F) were resolved in the gel mobility shift assay. To test for specificity, an antibody to the COOH terminus of Skn-1a/i was included in some reactions. The position of the supershifted complex is indicated (S). B, relative binding affinity of Skn-1a binding sites in the HPV-1A LCR. The bound and free complexes shown in Fig. 5 were excised and quantified by liquid scintillation counting.

An end-labeled −974/−681 fragment was incubated with (+) or without (−) Δ60Skn-1i protein, followed by a limited treatment with DNase I. The products were analyzed by denaturing electrophoresis along with Maxim-Gilbert sequencing reactions (G and G + A). The sequence of the protected region is shown on the left. Sequences (inboldface type) with high homology to octamer sites are indicated with brackets. D, binding of Δ60Skn-1i to tandem sites in the HPV-1A LCR.

A, an octamer site (O+H−) was32P-labeled, and binding to a bacterial extract containing the truncated Δ60Skn-1i (lanes 1–3), in vitrotranslated Tst-1 (lanes 4–6), HeLa nuclear extract (lanes 7–9), and a skin nuclear extract (lanes 10–16) was tested. The slow migrating complex in HeLa and skin extracts is the ubiquitous POU domain factor Oct-1 (data not shown). A Skn-1a/i antibody to the COOH terminus (antiserum 812) and a Tst-1 antibody selectively perturbed binding of Skn-1 (lane 2) and Tst-1 (lane 6), respectively. Neither antibody affected any of the complexes in HeLa cells. In contrast, Skn-1a/i antibodies to the NH2 terminus and part of the POU domain (antiserum 764;lane 11), Δ60Skn-1i (antiserum 813; lane 13), and COOH terminus (antiserum 812; lane 15) obliterated or supershifted the main octamer binding complex in skin. Antisera 764 and 813 apparently recognize epitopes on the POU domain and disrupt binding, while antiserum 812 recognizes only the COOH terminus and causes supershift. Tst-1 antibody had a minor effect on the binding activity in skin (lane 16). F, free probe. Thefilled arrow on the right indicates the location of the supershifted complex in lane 15.

After size fractionation and transfer to nitrocellulose, the RNA blots were hybridized with radiolabeled probes directed to the specific NH2 termini of Skn-1a and Skn-1i. Both probes contained a short fragment of common sequence. The Skn-1a fragment hybridized strongly to two major bands, 2.6 and 5.0 kilobase pairs long, (indicated with filled arrows in Fig. 2 B) and weakly to several other bands. As expected, given the common sequence included in both probes, the Skn-1i probe hybridized weakly to the same transcripts and preferentially to two other transcripts, 3.8 and 7.5 kilobase pairs long (indicated with open arrows in Fig. 2 B). The band in the Skn-1i lane that is over 9.5 kilobase pairs in size is most likely nonspecific because it is very diffuse, and it is not observed in the Skn-1a lane (Fig. 2 B). Together, these results suggest that while transcripts corresponding to both Skn-1a and Sk"

The structures of these chimeras in aqueous solution and in reconstituted high density lipoproteins (rHDL) and the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activation properties of the rHDL were studied. Recombinant human apoA-I and the chimeras were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from the periplasmic space. Binding of the apolipoproteins with palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine was associated with a similar shift of Trp fluorescence maxima from 337 to 332 nm, from 339 to 334 nm, and from 337 to 333 nm, respectively. All rHDL had a Stokes radius of 4.8 nm and contained 2 apolipoprotein molecules/particle. Circular dichroism measurements revealed eight α-helices per apoA-I and per chimera molecule. The catalytic efficiencies of LCAT activation were 1.5 ± 0.33 (mean ± S.D.; n = 3), 0.054 ± 0.009 (p < 0.001 versusapoA-I), and 1.3 ± 0.32 (p = not significantversus apoA-I) nmol of cholesteryl ester/h/μm, respectively.

In conclusion, although substitution of the Arg123–Tyr166 central or Ala190–Gln243 carboxyl-terminal pair of helices of apoA-I with the pair of helices of apoA-II yields chimeras with structure similar to that of native apoA-I, exchange of the central domain (but not the carboxyl-terminal domain) of apoA-I reduces the rate of LCAT activity that is independent of binding to rHDL.

Reported differences in LCAT activity of apoA-I and deletion mutants may result from altered folding and/or organization of these molecules in rHDL rather than from deletion of a functional domain (15Jonas A.

Therefore, in this study, the apoA-I(Δ(Arg123–Tyr166),∇A-II(Ser12–Ala75)) and apoA-I(Δ(Ala190–Gln243),∇A-II(Ser12–Gln77)) chimeras were produced, in which the Arg123–Tyr166 central or Ala190–Gln243 carboxyl-terminal pair of α-helices of apoA-I was deleted (Δ) and substituted (∇) with the pair of α-helices of apoA-II. The average structural properties in solution and in reconstituted high density lipoprotein particles of the two chimeras were found to be unaltered, but the central domain chimera had a markedly reduced LCAT activity.RESULTSFig. 1 is a schematic representation of the predicted amphipathic helical regions in apoA-I, apoA-II, apoA-I(Δ(Arg123–Tyr166),∇A-II(Ser12–Ala75)), and apoA-I(Δ(Ala190–Gln243),∇A-II(Ser12–Gln77)). The predicted number of amphipathic helices, according to Brasseuret al. (12Brasseur R. De Meutter J. Vanloo B. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Rosseneu M. Biochim. Biophys.

Wild-type apoA-I and the apoA-I/apoA-II chimeras were expressed in the periplasmic space of E. coli cells and purified to homogeneity as evidenced by their migration as single bands on 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2). The molecular masses of the apolipoproteins, calculated from a plot of the logarithm of the molecular masses of the standard proteins versus the migration distance, were 28.3 kDa for apoA-I and 30.4 and 29.8 kDa for the respective chimeras and thus were in agreement with those calculated on the basis of the respective amino acid compositions. Wild-type apoA-I migrated in the same position as plasma apoA-I. The identity of each band was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-human apoA-I antibodies (data not shown).The α-helical contents of the apolipoproteins in aqueous solution, as determined by circular dichroism scanning, were 48% for apoA-I and 43 and 41% for the respective chimeras. The recovery of apolipoproteins in discoidal apolipoprotein-POPC-cholesterol complexes after gel filtration was 90% for wild-type apoA-I and the chimeras. The Stokes radius of all rHDL was 4.8 nm (Fig. 3 and TableI). Cross-linking of the apolipoprotein molecules within all the discoidal apolipoprotein-POPC-cholesterol particles revealed 2 apolipoprotein molecules/particle (Fig. 4 and Table I). The phospholipid surface was calculated from the circumference of the disc using the measured diameter minus 3 nm, i.e. 2 × radius of an α-helix, multiplied by a disc height of 3.8 nm. The number of phospholipid molecules was calculated from the calculated surface divided by 0.45 nm2, the surface area/condensed phospholipid molecule. The calculated apolipoprotein/phospholipid molar ratios were 1:90, 1:83, and 1:89, respectively, and were in agreement with the ratios calculated on the basis of the composition of the rHDL.Figure 3Determination of Stokes radii of rHDL by native polyacrylamide gel scanning. rHDL particles, isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR column, were subjected to electrophoresis on 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions.

The fraction of the phospholipid surface that was covered by the α-helix was calculated as the total phospholipid surface in nm2 divided by 4 nm2, the surface area of an α-helix, that contains 16 amino acids. The calculated fraction was 0.77 for apoA-I and the chimeras (Table I).Binding of apoA-I and the chimeras to POPC was associated with a shift of Trp fluorescence maxima to lower wavelengths from 337 to 332 nm for apoA-I (both for plasma apoA-I and recombinant apoA-I), from 339 to 334 nm for the central domain chimera, and from 337 to 333 nm for the carboxyl-terminal domain chimera (Table II), suggesting that lipid binding is associated with a translocation of Trp residues to a more apolar environment. The quenching parametersK SV and f a are summarized in Table II. For totally exposed Trp residues, in the absence of electrostatic or viscosity effects, K SV = 12m−1 and f a = 1, whereas for totally protected Trp residues, K SV = 0 andf a = 0.

LCAT activation by the discoidal apolipoprotein-POPC-cholesterol complexes obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, as shown by linear Lineweaver-Burk plots of the inverse of the initial activation rate (1/V 0) versus the inverse of the cholesterol concentrations (1/[C]). The apparent kinetic parameters V max and K m and the V max/K m ratios for the different apolipoprotein-POPC-cholesterol complexes are summarized in Table III. Exchange of the Arg123–Tyr166 paired helix of apoA-I with the pair of helices of apoA-II reduced the LCAT activity of apoA-I 27-fold due to a reduction of V max and not ofK m. In contrast, exchange of the Ala190–Gln243 carboxyl-terminal domain helices of apoA-I with the pair of helices of apoA-II had no effect on the LCAT activity of apoA-I.Figure 5SDS-PAGE of recombinant LCAT on 10–15% gradient gels.

To further investigate the role of the central and carboxyl-terminal domains of apoA-I in LCAT activation, the apoA-I(Δ(Arg123–Tyr166),∇A-II(Ser12–Ala75)) and apoA-I(Δ(Ala190–Gln243),∇A-II(Ser12–Gln77)) chimeras were produced. The extent of in vitro phospholipid binding of these chimeras was similar to that of apoA-I, as demonstrated by comparable disc formation after mixing the apolipoproteins and phospholipids at equal weight ratios. This was evidenced by a shift of the maximum Trp fluorescence to a shorter wavelength and by a decreased accessibility of the Trp residues to I−. The sizes of rHDL reconstituted with apoA-I and the chimeras were identical: the respective rHDL contained 2 apolipoprotein molecules/particle, and circular dichroism scanning revealed eight α-helices per intact apoA-I molecule and per chimera molecule, in agreement with the predicted numbers according to Brasseur et al. (12Brasseur R. De Meutter J. Vanloo B. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Rosseneu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The calculated apolipoprotein/phospholipid molar ratios of the different rHDL particles were very similar. Thus, substitution of the Ala123–Tyr166 central or Ala190–Gln243 carboxyl-terminal domain helices of apoA-I with the pair of helices of apoA-II did not affect the size and the composition of rHDL, and the conformation and helical distribution in the different apolipoproteins in these particles were very similar. Substitution of the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I with the helices of apoA-II did not reduce LCAT activity, but substitution of the central domain resulted in a 27-fold reduction of LCAT activity, suggesting that the Ala123–Tyr166 segment is critical for LCAT activation. Binding experiments revealed that the reduced LCAT activity of the apoA-I(Δ(Arg123–Tyr166),∇A-II(Ser12–Ala75)) chimera was not due to reduced binding of LCAT to rHDL.Based on data obtained with synthetic peptides, it was concluded that the LCAT-activating domain of apoA-I resides in a 22-mer tandem repeat located between residues 66 and 121 (35Anantharamaiah G.M. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Brouillette C.G. Segrest J.P. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 95-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was further supported by the finding that monoclonal antibodies directed against an epitope that spanned residues 95–121 inhibited the LCAT activation with apoA-I (36Banka C.L. Bonnet D.J. Black A.S. Smith R.S. Curtiss L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23886-23892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of antibodies to an epitope in the amino-terminal domain of apoA-I may, however, induce conformational changes in the central domain of apoA-I that may be responsible for the reduction of LCAT activity (37Meng Q.-H. Calabresi L. Fruchart J.-C. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16966-16973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the Leu44–Leu126amino-terminal domain of apoA-I indeed did not reduce its LCAT activity (16Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that the amino-terminal domain of apoA-I is not critical for LCAT activation.Using deletion mutants of apoA-I, Minnich et al. (38Minnich A. Collet X. Roghani A. Cladaras C. Hamilton R.L. Fielding C.J. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16553-16560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that deletion of the Met148–Gly186 segment resulted in decreased LCAT activity, whereas Sorci-Thomas et al. (39Sorci-Thomas M. Kearns M.W. Lee J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21403-21409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that deletion of the Pro143–Ala164 segment reduced LCAT activity. In previous studies, the conformation of deletion mutants in their respective rHDL was not investigated. However, it has been demonstrated that the decreased LCAT activity of deletion mutants of apoA-I may be due to differences in folding (decreased α-helical content) and/or organization of the apolipoproteins in rHDL (3 or 4 molecules/particle as compared with 2 for intact apoA-I) rather than to the removal of specific domains for LCAT activity (16Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that rHDL discs containing wild-type apoA-I may have discrete sizes, compositions (with 2, 3, or 4 protein molecules/particle), and apoA-I conformations (with six, seven, or eight α-helices/apoA-I molecule in contact with lipid) and that differences in the apoA-I structure in these particles correlate with their ability to activate LCAT (40Jonas A. Kézdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Chimeras in which α-helical segments of apoA-I are substituted with helical segments of apoA-II, which does not activate LCAT, in such a way that the average secondary structure of the apolipoprotein molecule as well as the organization of the apolipoprotein molecules in rHDL are not affected may be preferable reagents to address the function of a particular structural domain in LCAT activation. Indeed, rHDL containing apoA-II have a very low LCAT activity (41Vanloo B. Taveirne J. Baert J. Loren G. Lins L. Ruysschaert J.M. Rosseneu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the addition of apoA-II together with apoA-I to liposomes reduces LCAT activity by 70% (42Chen C.H. Albers J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, substitution of sequences in apoA-I that are critical for the interaction with LCAT with sequences derived from apoA-II would result in decreased LCAT activity. Substitution of the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I with helices of apoA-II was found not to affect LCAT activity, but substitution of the central domain resulted in a 25-fold reduction of LCAT activity, suggesting that the central domain (but not the carboxyl-terminal domain) is essential for LCAT activation.The differences in LCAT activity were due to differences in apparentV max values, which reflect the activated enzyme concentration, and not to differences in apparent K m values, which reflect the affinity of LCAT for rHDL (43Bolin D.J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7429-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SimilarK m values are indeed in agreement with similar binding of LCAT to rHDL of apoA-I and the central domain chimera. Thus, the Ala123–Tyr166 segment of apoA-I appears to contain structures that are required for optimal phospholipid and cholesterol presentation to LCAT (44Sparks D.L. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5151-5157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that cannot be mimicked by the apoA-II segment. It is possible that substitution of the central domain affects the conformation of a hinged domain that is crucial for LCAT activation because antibodies that interfere with the mobility of a hinged domain in the central part of apoA-I inhibit LCAT activation (37Meng Q.-H. Calabresi L. Fruchart J.-C. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16966-16973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous data obtained with deletion mutants supported the existence of such a hinged domain overlapping either the Asn102–Lys140 or Ala124–His162 segment of apoA-I (16Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because conformational changes elsewhere in the molecule could not be excluded, these data were, however, not conclusive. The present study strongly suggests that this hinged domain most likely overlaps the Ala124–His162 domain of apoA-I.In conclusion, substitution of the central or carboxyl-terminal pair of helices of apoA-I with the helices of apoA-II does not affect its average structure in rHDL. Substitution of the central domain (but not the carboxyl-terminal domain) results in a significant reduction of the rate of LCAT activation, although the binding of LCAT to rHDL is not reduced.

In the present study, using the nystatin perforated patch recording configuration, we found that ATP (0.3–30 μm) induced a transient outward current in a concentration-dependent manner and that the reversal potential of the ATP-induced outward current was close to the K+ equilibrium potential, indicating that the membrane behaves like a K+ electrode in the presence of ATP. The first application of ATP to alveolar macrophages perfused with Ca2+-free external solution could induce the outward current, but the response to ATP was diminished with successive applications. Intracellular perfusion with a Ca2+ chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, also diminished the response. When cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) was applied to the macrophage cytoplasm, a transient outward current was elicited. Thereafter, the successive outward current was inhibited, suggesting the involvement of cADPR in the response. Intracellular perfusion with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate also induced a transient outward current, but the successive current was not inhibited. The ATP-induced outward current was abolished when 8-amino-cADPR (as a blocker of cADPR, 10−6–10−5m) was introduced into the cytoplasm. Homogenates of alveolar macrophages showed both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities, and CD38 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cADPR hydrolase) expression was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. These results indicate that ATP activates K+currents by releasing Ca2+ from cADPR-sensitive internal Ca2+ stores. There is growing evidence that extracellular ATP causes a dramatic change in the membrane conductance of a variety of inflammatory cells. In the present study, using the nystatin perforated patch recording configuration, we found that ATP (0.3–30 μm) induced a transient outward current in a concentration-dependent manner and that the reversal potential of the ATP-induced outward current was close to the K+ equilibrium potential, indicating that the membrane behaves like a K+ electrode in the presence of ATP. The first application of ATP to alveolar macrophages perfused with Ca2+-free external solution could induce the outward current, but the response to ATP was diminished with successive applications. Intracellular perfusion with a Ca2+ chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, also diminished the response. When cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) was applied to the macrophage cytoplasm, a transient outward current was elicited. Thereafter, the successive outward current was inhibited, suggesting the involvement of cADPR in the response. Intracellular perfusion with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate also induced a transient outward current, but the successive current was not inhibited. The ATP-induced outward current was abolished when 8-amino-cADPR (as a blocker of cADPR, 10−6–10−5m) was introduced into the cytoplasm. Homogenates of alveolar macrophages showed both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities, and CD38 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cADPR hydrolase) expression was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. These results indicate that ATP activates K+currents by releasing Ca2+ from cADPR-sensitive internal Ca2+ stores. The alveolar macrophages, which are the most abundant nonparenchymal cells in the lung, play a central role in maintaining normal lung structure and function through their capacity to scavenge particulates, remove macromolecular debris, kill microorganisms, act as accessory cells in immune responses, and recruit and activate other inflammatory cells (1Crystal R.G. Crystal R.G. West J.B. Barnes P.J. Cherniack N.S. Weibel E.R. The Lung: Scientific Foundations. Raven Press, New York1991: 527-537Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that extracellular ATP causes a dramatic change in the membrane conductance of a variety of inflammatory cells (2Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are several reports concerning the actions of extracellular ATP in macrophage-like established cell lines and, to a lesser extent, macrophages that have been induced by the injection of protein-rich fluids, including patch-clamp studies that described only inward currents by activation of the ion-nonselective conductance (3Buisman H.P.

A. 1988; 85: 7988-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and a biphasic current that is composed of a nonselective conductance and a Ca2+-dependent potassium conductance (4Albuquerque C.

Physiol. 1994; 44: 433-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we found that extracellular ATP mainly induced an outward current in the nonelicited pulmonary alveolar macrophage. We then analyzed the intracellular mechanism of this response. Here, we also report the first evidence that the macrophage has a Ca2+ store that is sensitive to cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), 1The abbreviations used are: cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; 8-NH2-cADPR, 8-amino-cADPR; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; PCR; polymerase chain reaction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; V H, holding potential;I ATP, ATP-induced transient outward current; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate;T L, latent time from the application of ATP until the onset of the I ATP; I, current; V, voltage; E ATP, average reversal potential of the I ATP;E K, K+ equilibrium potential; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free Ca2+concentration; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release;K G, G-protein activator-induced K+conductance; I CRAC, calcium release-activated current; CIF, Ca2+-influx factor. 1The abbreviations used are: cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; 8-NH2-cADPR, 8-amino-cADPR; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; PCR; polymerase chain reaction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; V H, holding potential;I ATP, ATP-induced transient outward current; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate;T L, latent time from the application of ATP until the onset of the I ATP; I, current; V, voltage; E ATP, average reversal potential of the I ATP;E K, K+ equilibrium potential; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free Ca2+concentration; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release;K G, G-protein activator-induced K+conductance; I CRAC, calcium release-activated current; CIF, Ca2+-influx factor. a newly discovered Ca2+-releasing second messenger (8Takasawa S.

Alveolar macrophages were obtained by pulmonary lavage from specific pathogen- and virus-free, 250–300-g Wistar rats using a modification of the method of Myrvik et al. (10Myrvik Q.N. Leake E.S. Fariss B. J. Immunol. 1960; 86: 128-132Google Scholar). In brief, the trachea was cannulated, and the lungs were lavaged four times with 7 ml of standard external solution at 37 °C. The lavage fluid was then filtered through a 37-μm gauge nylon cloth. The filtrate was centrifuged at 200 ×g for 10 min. The pelleted cells were resuspended and stored at 4 °C until use. The preparation yielded ∼107cells/rat, of which >97% were alveolar macrophages. Within 4 h after anesthetization, the cells were dropped into standard external solution in a Petri dish on the stage of a microscope, and the macrophages adhered to the bottom of the Petri dish within 7 min. In the present study, we adopted the data taken from the macrophages that were not morphologically different before and after the electrical measurements to avoid the possible influence of capacitance changes. The ionic composition of the standard external solution was (in mm): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES; the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris base. The external solutions containing 10, 30, and 60 mm K+ were made by the substitution of equimolar Na+ with K+. The Ca2+-free external solution containing 2 mmEGTA was composed of (in mm): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris base. The composition of the patch-pipette (internal) solution for the nystatin perforated patch was (in mm): 150 KCl and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with Tris base. Nystatin was dissolved in methanol (10 mg/ml) and then diluted to a final concentration of 75 μg/ml in the pipette solution as described (7Akaike N. Harata N. Jap. J. Physiol. 1994; 44: 433-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The composition of the pipette solution for the conventional whole-cell patch was (in mm): 150 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 Na2ATP, 0.5 Na2GTP, 0.5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with Tris base. The nystatin perforated patch recording configuration (6Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) was used to prevent the diffusion of intracellular constituents into the patch-pipette (7Akaike N. Harata N. Jap. J. Physiol. 1994; 44: 433-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Ionic currents were measured with a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany), low pass filtered at 1 kHz (FV-665, NF Electronic Instruments, Yokohama, Japan), and monitored on both a storage oscilloscope (HS-5100A, Iwatsu, Tokyo, Japan) and a pen recorder (RECTI-HORIZ-8K21, Nippondenki San-ei, Tokyo, Japan). Patch-pipettes were made of glass capillary with an outer diameter of 1.5 mm using a vertical puller (PB-7, Narishige Scientific Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) and had a tip resistance of 4–8 megohms. The junctional potential between the patch-pipette and bath solution was nulled by the amplifier circuitry. Drugs were applied rapidly using the Y-tube method (11Murase K. Randic M. Shirasaki T. Nakagawa T. Akaike N. Brain Res. 1990; 525: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In brief, the small orifice (about 40 μm in diameter) of the Y-tube tip was placed near a macrophage in a Petri dish with continuous perfusion of the external solution. One of the other two ends was immersed in the external solution in a test tube, and the third was connected to a vacuum pump via an electromagnetic valve that was controlled with a stimulator (SEN-7103, Nihon Koden). With the opening of the valve for 1 s, the external solution was drawn from the test tube beyond the orifice by a negative pressure of −400 mmHg. Following closure of the valve, the external solution was flushed out from the Y-tube tip to the macrophage by gravity. The exchange of the external solution surrounding an alveolar macrophage was completed within 10–20 ms. cADPR was prepared from NAD+ with ADP-ribosyl cyclase purified from ovotestes of Aplysia kurodai, a marine mollusk common around the Japanese coast, as described (8Takasawa S.

Dis. 1993; 147 (abstr.): 936Google Scholar). 8-Amino (NH2)-cADPR was synthesized and purified as described (13Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys.

BAPTA was obtained from Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan. Charybdotoxin was from Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan. All other chemicals used were purchased from Sigma. Total RNA was isolated (15Koguma T.

The reverse transcriptase sample (1 μl) was used for PCR in a final volume of 50 μl as described (15Koguma T. Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Karasawa T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Biochim. Biophys.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar) for rat G3PDH mRNA. The nucleotide sequences of the resultant PCR products were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Rat alveolar macrophages (7 × 106 cells) were homogenized in 0.4 ml of homogenizing buffer (50 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25m sucrose, pH 7.2) supplemented with 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Western blot analysis was carried out as described (18Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugimoto T. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol.

ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities were measured essentially as described (18Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugimoto T. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol.

Briefly, the macrophage homogenate (50 μg of protein) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) with 0.2 mm NAD+ containing 5 μCi of [32P]NAD+ (DuPont NEN) for ADP-ribosyl cyclase or with 0.2 mm cADPR containing 5 μCi of [32P]cADPR for cADPR hydrolase. Reaction products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography using a flow scintillation analyzer (Flow-One Beta-525TR, Packard, Meriden, CT). Using the nystatin perforated patch recording mode, whole-cell currents were recorded from the alveolar macrophages. Under the current-clamp condition, the average resting membrane potential of the alveolar macrophage was −22.5 ± 3.7 mV (n = 21). The mean input capacitance was 19.8 ± 2.5 picofarads (n = 12). Of 138 alveolar macrophages treated with 10 μm ATP at a holding potential (V H) of −20 mV, 104 (75.4%) responded to ATP. In the 104 macrophages that responded to ATP, 10 μm ATP evoked a transient outward current (Fig.1 A) in 82 cells (78.8%), inward currents (Fig. 1 B) in 5 cells (4.8%), outward oscillations (Fig.1 C) in 3 cells (2.9%), and a mixture of outward and inward currents (Fig. 1 D) in 14 cells (13.5%). No significant differences in morphology were observed among the four types of rat macrophages studied.Figure 5Involvement of Ca2+ inI ATP. The symbols depicted on theleft in panels A and B represent a nystatin perforated patch configuration, and that on theright in panel A represents a conventional whole-cell patch. The nystatin perforated patch is thought to form monovalent ion paths in the membrane just beneath the patch-pipette, preventing washout of cellular factors by the pipette solution. The conventional whole-cell configuration was employed to introduce molecules such as BAPTA into the cytoplasm via the patch-pipette through a rupture made by repetitive negative pressure applied to the pipette tip. Panel A, effect of intracellular BAPTA onI ATP at a V H of −20 mV. ATP (10−5m) was applied before (left) and 6 min after (right) the rupture of the patch membrane with a pipette filled with a solution containing 10 mm BAPTA. I ATP was blocked completely by intracellular perfusion with 10 mm BAPTA. The results are typical of five reproducible observations. Panel B, effect of removing extracellular Ca2+ onI ATP. Current traces were obtained from the same macrophage at a V H of −20 mV. The ATP (10−5m) was applied repeatedly at an interval of 3 min before and during the superfusion with Ca2+-free external solution containing 2 mm EGTA. The first application of ATP in Ca2+-free solution induced anI ATP that was almost identical to that in the standard external solution, but the I ATP values in subsequent applications were inhibited. Restoration to the standard external solution resulted in complete recovery of theI ATP. The results are typical of five reproducible observations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Different patterns of currents evoked by 10 μm ATP at a V H of −20 mV using the nystatin perforated patch recording configuration.

Using the nystatin perforated patch recording mode, successive applications of ATP at intervals of more than 3 min induced almost identical outward currents. The mean peak amplitude ofI ATP was 122 ± 7 pA (n = 82). Therefore, in the present study, mainly the nystatin perforated patch recording mode was used to analyze I ATP. The conventional whole-cell patch technique was also used for intracellular perfusion of BAPTA, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), cADPR, and 8-NH2-cADPR. Fig.2 shows the concentration dependence ofI ATP elicited by various concentrations of ATP applied with the Y-tube method at a V H of −20 mV. The peak amplitude of I ATP increased in a concentration-dependent manner over the concentration range between 0.3 and 30 μm. At concentrations of ATP above 100 μm, ATP evoked an additional inward current that was superimposed on the I ATP (not shown), and those current traces resembled that in Fig. 1 D. The latent time from the application of ATP until the onset of theI ATP (T L) was measured. In this experiment, the external solution surrounding an alveolar macrophage could be exchanged completely within 20 ms (10Myrvik Q.N. Leake E.S. Fariss B. J. Immunol. 1960; 86: 128-132Google Scholar). Therefore, the time when the ATP reached the cell could be determined accurately by monitoring the closure of the electromagnetic valve. TheT L values at 22 °C were 10.3 ± 2.2 s (n = 5), 8.5 ± 1.2 s (n = 7), 9.2 ± 1.2 s (n = 7), 8.2 ± 0.7 s (n = 7), and 9.1 ± 1.0 s (n = 7) for 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μm ATP, respectively, indicating that the T L was independent of the concentration range between 0.3 and 30 μm. Fig.3 A shows the currents induced by 10 μm ATP at various V H values. In the current (I)-voltage (V) relationship, the ATP responses at various V H values were normalized to the peak response induced by ATP at a V H of −40 mV (*, Fig. 3 B). The average reversal potential of theI ATP (E ATP) estimated from the intersection on the voltage axis in theI-V curves was −79.5 ± 1.2 mV (n = 6). This value was close to the K+equilibrium potential (E K) of −85.9 mV calculated with the Nernst equation for the given extra- and intracellular K+ concentrations ([K+] o = 5 mm and [K+] i = 150 mm, respectively). When the macrophages were perfused with a normal internal solution and an external solution containing various concentrations of K+ ([K+] o = 10, 30 and 60 mm), the E ATP values were −63.1 ± 3.1 mV (n = 5), −43.8 ± 1.8 mV (n = 6), and −23.5 ± 1.2 mV (n = 5) for 10, 30, and 60 mm[K+] o, respectively. The change inE ATP for a 10-fold change in [K+] o was 51.9 mV (Fig.3 C), indicating that the cell membrane behaves like a K+ electrode in the presence of ATP. To elucidate the pharmacological properties of the K+ channel activated by ATP, the effects of K+ channel blockers such as apamin, charybdotoxin, tetraethylammonium, and quinidine on I ATP were tested at a V H of −20 mV. The macrophages were pretreated for 2 min with the normal external solution containing various K+ channel blockers. Then 10 μm ATP and one of the blockers were applied simultaneously.I ATP was almost completely inhibited by 0.5 mm quinidine (Fig. 4). In contrast, blockers of two types of Ca2+-dependent K+channels, 1 μm apamin, which blocks the small K+ conductance (20Blatz A.L. Magleby K.L. Nature. 1986; 323: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and 1 μm charybdotoxin, which blocks the large and intermediate K+ conductances (21Castle N.A. Haylett D.G. Jenkinson D.H. Trends Neurol. Sci. 1989; 12: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), were ineffective. 10 mm tetraethylammonium also had no effect on the I ATP (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether a rise in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) is necessary for theI ATP, the following studies were performed. In the first study, the effect of intracellular Ca2+ chelation by BAPTA on I ATP was examined. After theI ATP was recorded by the nystatin perforated patch recording mode with the patch-pipette filled with solution containing 10 mm BAPTA, the patched membrane was ruptured by applying negative pressure. The recording that followed was made in the conventional whole-cell mode. Intracellular perfusion with BAPTA caused a complete abolition of the I ATP in all macrophages tested (n = 7) (Fig. 5). On the other hand, 6-min intracellular perfusion with the patch-pipette solution without BAPTA in the conventional whole-cell patch recording mode after membrane rupture had little effect on theI ATP (84 ± 16% of control,n = 5). The second study was performed with the nystatin perforated patch recording configuration. ATP was applied to the macrophages before and during continuous superfusion with Ca2+-free external solution containing 2 mmEGTA. The first application of ATP during the perfusion with Ca2+-free external solution could induce anI ATP similar to that in the standard external solution. However, the second application of ATP after a 3-min interval induced little I ATP, and the fourth and subsequent applications could not induce any response, as shown in Fig.5 B. 3 min after the return to the standard external solution containing 2 mm Ca2+, theI ATP was completely restored. These results indicate that the increase of [Ca2+] i is an important factor for inducing the I ATP and that Ca2+ is released from the intracellular Ca2+ stores in the presence of ATP. Two major mechanisms are known to mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores (22Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). One is the IP3-dependent pathway, whereas the other is Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) (23Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The CICR is believed to be mediated by the ryanodine receptor, which is also a Ca2+-sensitive Ca2+ channel (24Takeshima T. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 25Smith J.S. Imagawa T. Ma J. Fill M. Campbell K.P. Coronado R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that CICR may be regulated by cADPR, a newly discovered cyclic nucleotide (9Galione A. Science. 1993; 259: 325-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To evaluate which mechanism is involved in I ATP, we perfused IP3 or cADPR intracellularly. Using the nystatin perforated patch mode, the first application of 10−5mATP markedly inhibited the response to the second application of 10−5m ATP 20 s after the current traces returned to the base line (Fig. 6 A). Intracellular perfusion with 10−5mIP3 induced a transient outward current (88.2 ± 8.2 pA, n = 5), and the application of 10−5m ATP 20 s after the current trace returned to the base line induced an I ATP of ordinary size (92.6 ± 9.5 pA, n = 5, Fig. 6 B). On the other hand, the intracellular perfusion with cADPR also induced a transient outward current, but successive applications of 10−5m ATP of 20 s after the current trace returned to the base line could induce only a small current (Fig.6 C). Moreover, an antagonist of cADPR, 8-NH2-cADPR (10−6–10−5m), abolished I ATP when introduced into the cell interior via patch-pipette using a conventional whole-cell configuration (Fig. 6 D). In 12 out of 13 cells investigated, exogenous ATP elicited essentially no response in the presence of 8-NH2-cADPR. Only one cell responded to ATP with a transient inward current (in a manner quite similar to Fig.1 B). Fig. 6 E shows the concentration dependence of cADPR regulation on the K+ current. These results suggested that cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ stores might be involved in the I ATP. To confirm the presence of a cADPR-mediated signaling system in macrophages, we prepared RNAs and performed reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of mRNAs for CD38 and BST-1 which catalyze the synthesis and degradation of cADPR (15Koguma T.

Ishikawa J. Kaisho T. Ishihara K. Hirano T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7 A, BST-1 mRNA was detected in almost all of the tissues examined except for salivary gland. CD38 mRNA was detected in liver, spleen, thymus, islets, cerebellum, cerebrum, heart, salivary gland, and alveolar macrophages. Moreover, CD38 was detected in alveolar macrophages by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7 B), and the macrophage homogenate exhibited both ADP-ribosyl cyclase (14.03 ± 3.99 pmol/min/mg of protein, n = 3) and cADPR hydrolase (327.7 ± 51.5 pmol/min/mg of protein,n = 3) activities. We have studied the electrophysiological effects of extracellular ATP on the membrane properties of rat alveolar macrophages. Under the whole-cell voltage-clamp condition, the typical current response to extracellular ATP is a transient outward current at a V H of −20 mV, which is close to the resting membrane potential. This resting membrane potential was more positive than that measured in cultured macrophages (3Buisman H.P. Steinberg T.H. Fischberg J. Silverstein S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7988-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Takeshima T. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S.

However, in our present preparation, there is also a possibility that the cells were damaged by the collecting procedure. It is difficult to determine which preparation is more physiological. At the resting membrane potential of our preparation, we clearly showed that ATP induced mainly an outward K+ current, which is mediated via the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Using the patch-clamp technique, evidence for the existence of two types of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (delayed rectifier K+ channel and inward rectifying K+ channel), an outwardly rectifying noninactivating channel, a large conductance anion channel, ligand-dependent Fc receptor-associated channel, and an ATP-activated cation-selective conductance have been reported in macrophages (3Buisman H.P.

Recently, extracellular ATP-induced Ca2+-dependent K+ channels were reported in thioglycolate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages (4Albuquerque C. Oliveira S.M.C. Coutinho-silva R.

Oliveira-Castro G.M. Persechini P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1663-C1673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rat alveolar macrophages, the pharmacological properties of the K+ current activated by ATP were not only similar to those in mouse peritoneal macrophage (5Hara N. Ichinose M. Sawada M. Maeno T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 98A: 417-421Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in terms of the sensitivity to quinidine and tetraethylammonium, but also to those of G-protein activator-induced K+ conductance (K G) (30McKinney L.C. Gallin E.K. J. Membrane Biol. 1992; 130: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The current-voltage relationship ofI ATP shows an outward rectification similar to that of K G. In K G, the mechanism of K+ channel activation after G-protein activation has not been elucidated except for the evidence that cyclic AMP and IP3 are not involved in K G. Therefore, K G is one of the candidate channels responsible for I ATP. I ATP was diminished by intracellular perfusion with BAPTA (Fig. 5 A). In rat alveolar macrophage, using fura-2/AM, Hagenlocker et al. (31Hagenlocker B.E. Walker B.A.M. Ward P.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3898-3906PubMed Google Scholar) showed that extracellular ATP increased intracellular Ca2+. The evidence showed that theI ATP was most likely due to a rise in the intracellular Ca2+. Since removal of extracellular Ca2+ from the external medium did not block the response by the first application of ATP, the action of ATP appears to be mediated via the mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores. However, subsequent attenuation of the response in the Ca2+-deficient solution suggests that internal Ca2+ stores are depleted during the response and are not subsequently replenished in a Ca2+-free solution. Thus, a refilling of internal stores by external Ca2+ is important for maintaining the vigorous response to ATP. Fig. 6 A shows that 20 s is too short for refilling the Ca2+ stores after the maximal ATP response. There is evidence that stimulation of macrophages by platelet-activating factor (32Prpic V. Uhing R.J. Weiel J.E. Jakoi L. Gawdi G. Herman B. Adams D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (33Prpic V. Weiel J.E. Somers S.D. DiGuiseppi J. Gonias S.L. Pizzo S.V. Hamilton T.A. Herman B. Adams D.O. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 526-533PubMed Google Scholar) leads to the activation of the phospholipase C cascade and to a subsequent increase in intracellular Ca2+. Moreover, Pfeilschifter et al. (34Pfeilschifter J. Thuring B. Festa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported that extracellular ATP stimulates poly(inositol phospholipid) hydrolysis in mouse peritoneal macrophages in culture. Therefore, the most likely possibility is that ATP stimulates the production of IP3, resulting in a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. However, in this study, Ca2+ store depletion by IP3 did not inhibit the subsequent ATP response, implying that the IP3-sensitive store might not be the sole Ca2+ store responsible for I ATP. An interesting candidate for this purinergic signaling pathway is the newly discovered Ca2+-releasing compound cADPR, which is synthesized from NAD+ by ADP-ribosyl cyclase (35Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Okamoto H. Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and which is reported to be dependent upon cyclic GMP (22Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar, 37Galione A. White A. Willmott N. Turner M. Potter B.V.L. Watson S.P. Nature. 1993; 365: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that stimulation of macrophages with ATP causes synthesis of cGMP (38Randriamampita C. Ciapa B. Trautmann A. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1991; 417: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This cyclic GMP production could be implicated in the Ca2+ release through the cADPR pathway. Our finding that Ca2+ store stimulation by cADPR inhibited the successive ATP response suggests the possibility that cADPR acts as an intracellular Ca2+-releasing messenger following ATP stimulation. The experiment using 8-NH2-cADPR, a blocker of cADPR, further supported the idea. This insight was also evidenced by the fact that CD38 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cADPR hydrolase) and its mRNA were detected and that cADPR metabolizing activities were detected in macrophages. Furthermore, FK506-binding proteins were recently shown to be essential for the Ca2+ release by cADPR from the ryanodine receptor and also detected in macrophages (39Noguchi N. Takasawa S. Nata K. Tohgo A. Kato I. Ikehata F. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3133-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The onset of I ATP was abrupt, following about 10 s of total quiescence after the application of ATP, thereby indicating the existence of a definite latency in the appearance of the ATP response. In some recent reports the responses mediated by cADPR followed the responses mediated by IP3 in lacrimal acinar cells (40Gromada J. Jorgensen T.D. Dissing S. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and tracheal mucosal gland (12Sasaki T. Shimura S. Takasawa S. Nagaki M. Satoh M. Okamoto H. Shirato K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147 (abstr.): 936Google Scholar). The latency ofI ATP in the alveolar macrophage is quite similar to the time required for lacrimal acinar cells to reach the peaks in the intracellular Ca2+ transient induced by β-adrenergic stimulation and for the muscarinic receptor-coupled K+ (M) channel inhibition by acetylcholine in rodent NG108–15 cells (41Higashida H. Robbins J. Egorova A. Noda M. Taketo M. Isizaki N. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. 1995; 482: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the involvement of the cADPR-mediated signaling pathway has been reported in these cell types, the evidence might also suggest that the I ATP was mediated by cADPR. We report here the first evidence that alveolar macrophages have a cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ store. Accumulating evidence suggests that cADPR may be an endogenous modulator of the CICR mechanism (9Galione A. Science. 1993; 259: 325-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The CICR is believed to be mediated by the ryanodine receptor, which is also a Ca2+-sensitive Ca2+ channel (24Takeshima T. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 25Smith J.S. Imagawa T. Ma J. Fill M. Campbell K.P. Coronado R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). It was originally thought that caffeine acts solely as an agonist for the ryanodine receptor. In this study, caffeine and ryanodine could not induce any Ca2+-dependent K+current, implying that the rat alveolar macrophages have no CICR mechanism. 2We used caffeine and ryanodine to try to activate the CICR process. However, using a perforated patch mode, neither 10−2m caffeine (n = 21) nor 10 μm ryanodine (n = 10) could induce any currents in the alveolar macrophages tested. Moreover, a mixture of caffeine (10−2m) and ryanodine (10 μm) also could not induce any currents (n= 5). However, recent experiments indicate that these compounds have multiple pharmacological effects, confusing the classification of intracellular Ca2+ release channels (42Ehrlich B.E. Kaftan E. Bezprozvannaya S. Bezprozvanny I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies are needed to evaluate the Ca2+-releasing mechanism in rat alveolar macrophages. A concentration of 10 μm extracellular ATP sufficed to induce clearly detectable outward currents. This value is less than that detected in the plasma after degranulation of platelets (43Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), suggesting that the phenomena we described here can be of physiological significance. The ability of ATP to increase the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration raises the interesting possibility that some of the secretory and immune actions of macrophages are regulated by extracellular ATP (2Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological roles of the activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels by ATP in alveolar macrophages are uncertain, but they could amplify the Ca2+ signal by keeping the cell membrane at a hyperpolarized potential to sustain the driving force for Ca2+ influx during macrophage activation. Recently, a Ca2+ current activated by intracellular Ca2+store depletion has been characterized in a variety of cells including macrophages (44Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 45Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 46Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and this current has been called the calcium release-activated current (I CRAC).I CRAC is activated by molecules, called Ca2+ influx factor (CIF), released from depleted Ca2+ stores (45Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 46Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and is also facilitated when the membrane is hyperpolarized (44Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Therefore, in alveolar macrophages stimulated by ATP, both CIF and Ca2+-dependent K+ current might act synergistically to replenish the Ca2+ store. We thank Brent Bell for reading the manuscript."

Guanylyl cyclases appear to fall into two general families.

In amphibian ROS, these Pγ functions are interrupted by Pγ release with GTP·Tα from Pαβ (12Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamazaki A. Bartucca F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have recently suggested that these functionally different Pγs are released in the different steps of phototransduction (15Yamazaki A. Bondarenko V.A. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Usukura J. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32495-32498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Yamazaki A. Yamazaki M. Bondarenko V.A. Matsumoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). When [cGMP] is at the dark level, Pγ responsible for the inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis is released. Consequently, cGMP is hydrolyzed by the activated PDE for photoexcitation. When [cGMP] becomes low, Pγ responsible for the stimulation of cGMP binding is released, and the affinities of these noncatalytic sites to cGMP are drastically reduced. The resulting release of cGMP from these noncatalytic sites may facilitate the recovery of cytoplasmic [cGMP] to the dark level in ROS. To understand physiological functions of protein-protein interaction, functional structures of the protein involved should be elucidated. Pγ functional structure is especially interesting because such a small protein (87 amino acids) plays important roles in phototransduction by interacting with various proteins. At least four different interactions are considered: (a) Pγ-Pαβ interaction for the inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis by Pαβ; (b) Pγ-Pαβ interaction for the stimulation of cGMP binding to Pαβ noncatalytic sites; (c) Pγ-Tα interaction for the release of Pγ inhibitory strain from Pαβ; and (d) Pγ-Tα interaction for the release of Pγ to reduce the affinity of Pαβ noncatalytic sites to cGMP. Previous studies have focused on interactions (a) and (c). Peptides have been used to identify the polycationic region of Pγ within residues 24–45 and the carboxyl-terminal region of Pγ corresponding to residue 46–87 as the sites for the interaction (a) (19Morrison D.F. Cunnick J.M. Oppert B. Takemoto D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11671-11681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Morrison D.F. Rider M.A. Takemoto D.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of Pγ has also shown that the carboxyl-terminal residues and several positive charged residues in the polycationic region are also involved in the inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis (23Brown R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5918-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Lipkin V.M. Bondarenko V.A. Zagranichny V.E. Dobrynina L.N. Muradov K.G. Natochin M.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Without impairing interaction with Pαβ, a frameshift mutation of Pγ has also revealed that the carboxyl-terminal residues are involved in the cGMP hydrolysis inhibition (15Yamazaki A. Bondarenko V.A. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Usukura J. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32495-32498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, the polycationic region and a site near the carboxyl terminus in Pγ have been suggested as sites required for the interaction (c) (19Morrison D.F. Cunnick J.M. Oppert B. Takemoto D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11671-11681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brown R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5918-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Lipkin V.M. Dumler I.L.

Chem. 1995; 270 (2nd Ed.): 13210-13215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, little is known about Pγ domains involved in the interactions (b) and (d). The frameshift mutation of Pγ has suggested that the amino-terminal residues are involved in the stimulation of cGMP binding to noncatalytic sites on Pαβ (15Yamazaki A. Bondarenko V.A. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Usukura J. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32495-32498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, a Tα interaction site on Pγ, which is required for the Pγ release to reduce the affinity of Pαβ noncatalytic sites to cGMP, has not been identified. In this study we have focused on identification of specific residues in the Pγ polycationic region for following reasons. (i) The polycationic region has been suggested to be involved in the interaction with both Pαβ and GTP·Tα for the regulation of cGMP hydrolysis. Identification of amino acid residues in the polycationic region seems to be crucial to reveal the mechanism for the Pγ release by GTP·Tα. However, residues required for these interactions have not been identified. (ii) We found that the specific arginines in the Pγ polycationic region were ADP-ribosylated by an endogenous enzyme. Thus, protein-protein interactions in which the polycationic region is involved may be monitored by tracing the Pγ ADP-ribosylation under physiological conditions. (iii) We also found that the Pγ ADP-ribosylation was regulated by the interaction between Pγ and Tα. Therefore, the ADP-ribosylation can be a useful tool to learn the interaction between Pγ and Tα. We describe that both arginine 33 and arginine 36 in the Pγ, free or complexed with Pαβ, are ADP-ribosylated by endogenous arginine-ADP-ribosyltransferase. The Pγ ADP-ribosylation is inhibited when Pγ is complexed with Tα (both GTP- and GDP-bound forms), suggesting that the domain including these arginines is not exposed to ADP-ribosyltransferase when Pγ is complexed with Tα. Then, using forms of Pγ mutated in these residues, we confirm that the domain is involved in the interaction with Tα. Moreover, we find that positive charges in these arginine are important for the interaction with Tα. Mono Q (5 × 50 mm), Pep RPC HR5/5 (5 × 50 mm), TSK G2000SW (7.5 × 300 mm), DEAE-Sephacel, SP-Sepharose Fast Flow, and Blue Sepharose CL-6B were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. AG 1-X2 resin was obtained from Bio-Rad. Other materials were purchased from the following sources: [adenylate-32P]NAD, [3H]cGMP, [γ32P]GTP, and [35S]GTPγS from DuPont NEN; cGMP, GTP, GDP, GDPβS, Gpp(NH)p, and GTPγS from Boehringer Mannheim; novobiocin, snake venom phosphodiesterase, arginine methyl ester, cysteine methyl ester, PMSF, agmatine, and NAD-agarose from Sigma. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (fromBacillus thuringiensis) was obtained from ICN, and 1 unit was defined as the supplier described. Suppliers of materials for molecular biological experiments are described in these sections. Buffer A consisted of 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Buffer B consisted of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmDTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Buffer C consisted of 100 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Buffer D consisted of 5 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Buffer E consisted of 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 50 mmNaCl. Buffer F consisted of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin. Buffer G consisted of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmDTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. Buffer H consisted of 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm MgCl2. Buffer I consisted of 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2. Under dim red light, ROS were prepared from dark adapted bullfrogs (Rana catesbiana orRana grylio) by 46% sucrose flotation in Buffer A. Although various amounts of ROS membranes were washed in this study, we used a similar method. Bleached ROS membranes from 20 frogs were suspended in 3 ml of Buffer B and passed through a no. 21 needle seven times. Membranes and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation (200,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). ROS membranes were washed seven times in the same way, and these ROS membranes were termed prewashed ROS membranes. The prewashed ROS membranes were washed seven more times with 3 ml of Buffer C and seven times with 3 ml of Buffer C containing 400 μm GTP. Tα (more than 90%) and Pγ (about 50%) were released from these membranes. These membranes contain Pγ-less (active) PDE and were termed as Pγ-depleted ROS membranes. Residual Pγ in these membranes is not sensitive to GTP·Tα (12Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the membrane preparation contains a distinct subset of Pγ which cannot be released by GTP·Tα. This subset of Pγ was termed GTP·Tα-insensitive Pγ. When Pγ-depleted ROS membranes were used as a source for ADP-ribosyltransferase, these membranes were washed twice with 2 ml of Buffer C to remove residual GTP. When the Pγ-depleted membranes were washed an additional seven times with 3 ml of Buffer D, Tβγ (more than 90%) was released. These membranes are termed Pγ- and transducin-depleted ROS membranes. It should be emphasized that ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was detected in Pγ-depleted and Pγ- and transducin-depleted membranes when frog or recombinant bovine Pγ was used as a substrate. However, ADP-ribosylation of the residual Pγ was not detected in these membranes. This suggests that GTP·Tα-insensitive Pγ cannot be ADP-ribosylated. Urea-treated ROS membranes were prepared as described (13Yamazaki A. Bartucca F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

All mutagenic oligonucleotide primers used (Table I) were purchased from DNAgency Inc. (Malvern, PA). Mutagenesis was carried out using Altered Site System Mutagenesis Kit (Promega). Mutant clones were identified by in situ hybridization with32P-labeled mutagene oligonucleotides. The mutations were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing using the fmol of DNA sequencing System (Promega). Two oligonucleotides: Up-5′-GCCAACCTGCATATGAACCTGGAGCC-3′ and Down-5′ GGGGTCGGATCCTAGATGATGCCATACTG-3′ were used in a polymerase chain reaction to introduce NdeI and BamHI sites at the ends of Pγ genes. The NdeI-BamHI fragment was cloned into the NdeI-BamHI-digested pET-IIA (Novogene). The vector was transferred to Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) (Novogene) for expression of Pγ.Table IOligonucleotides used in site-directed mutagenesisMutantsOligonucleotides1-aUnderlined letters indicate mutation sites.R11KA: 5′-GCCGAGATCAAATCGGCCACC-3′R15KB: 5′-TCGGCCACAAAAGTGATGGGG-3′R24EC: 5′-CCGTCACTCCCGAAAAAGGGCC-3′R24KD: 5′-CCGTCACTCCCAACAAAGGGCCCCC-3′R33KE: 5′-CGAAATTTAAGCAAAAACAAACCAGG-3′R36KF: 5′-CGGCAAACAAAACAGTTCAAG-3′R11,15KG: 5′-GCCGAGATCAAATCGGCCACCAAAGTGATGGGG-3′R33,36LH: 5′-ATTTGAACTGCAGCGTCTGCAGCTGTTTGAA-3′R33,36KI: 5′-TTTAAGCAGAAACAAACCAAGCAGTTCAAG-3′R15,24KOligo B + oligo DR11,15,33,36KOligo G + oligo IR11,15,24,33,36KOligo D + oligo G + oligo I1-a Underlined letters indicate mutation sites. Open table in a new tab A fresh single colony was grown overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight culture was diluted 1:100 into a medium (12 g of tryptone, 24 g of yeast extract, and 0.2 ml of 5m NaOH/1,000 ml) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the culture was grown at 37 °C. At an A 600 nm≈ 0.6, protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm (final) isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells were incubated for another 4 h at room temperature. Then, cells were spun down (1,700 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 0.10 volume of Buffer E. After sonication, insoluble material was spun down (200,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded into an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (6 × 100 mm) that had been equilibrated with Buffer E. After washing with 10 bed volumes of Buffer E containing 100 mm NaCl, the protein was eluted using 10 ml of Buffer E with a gradient of 0.2–0.5m NaCl. Following the measurement of PDE inhibitory activity, the active fractions were collected, heated at 80 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged (345,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Pγ and its mutants were further purified using Pep RPC HR5/5 column as described (12Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of Pγ and its mutants was greater than 90%. Frog Pγ was purified from the supernatant prepared by washing prewashed ROS membranes with Buffer C containing GTP (12Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Siliconized tubes and pipette tips were used in all experiments using Pγ except SDS-gel electrophoresis. Tα (GTPγS- and GDP-bound forms) and Tβγ were isolated as described (30Yamazaki A. Tatsumi M. Torney D.C. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9316-9323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments partially purified ADP-ribosyltransferase was used. ADP-ribosyltransferase was solubilized in 10 ml of Buffer F containing phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (1 unit) from Pγ-depleted membranes (120 mg of protein). Following incubation (37 °C, 30 min), the sample was centrifuged (200,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was applied to a Blue Sepharose CL-6B column (3 ml) that had been equilibrated with Buffer F and washed with 12 ml of Buffer F. Flow-through and washing fractions were collected and applied to NAD-agarose (2 ml) that had been equilibrated with Buffer F. The column was washed with 15 ml of Buffer F, and ADP-ribosyltransferase was eluted with 6 ml of Buffer F containing 100 μm NAD (its purity was about 80%). After dialysis against Buffer F, ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was measured. ADP-ribosylation of Pγ was carried out with various membrane preparations or enzyme preparations solubilized by detergents or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Frog Pγ and recombinant bovine Pγ were used. Both Pγs were ADP-ribosylated in a similar manner. The amounts of each components were slightly different in each experiment (see each figure legend); however, Pγ ADP-ribosylation was performed in a similar way. The reaction mixture contained Pγ (0.2–0.6 μg), NAD (10–50 μm; ∼0.5 μCi) and proteins in the 50 μl of Buffer G. Pγ ADP-ribosylation was initiated by the addition of [adenylate-32P]NAD and terminated by heating with SDS-sample buffer (5 min, 80 °C). These samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gradient (8–16%) gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The band corresponding to Pγ (its apparent molecular weight is 13,000 in gels) was also excised from gels, and its radioactivity was measured. The radioactivity was proportional to the value obtained by densitometric scanning. As a control, the same procedure was performed without added Pγ, and the radioactivity of the corresponding region was subtracted from the radioactivity of the Pγ band. Without added Pγ, no 13,000 band was detected, and the radioactivity was negligible. If one amino acid in Pγ was radiolabeled, approximately 3–10% of Pγ was apparently radiolabeled in the regular experiments, and the apparent maximum incorporation of radioactivity was 23% (see Fig. 2). Possible reasons for such a low incorporation of the apparent radioactivity will be discussed later. When pertussis toxin was used, pertussis toxin was activated as described (31Yamazaki A. Bitensky M.W. Garcia-Sainz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9324-9331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to Pγ residues 30–39 (FKQRQTROFK) and its mutant forms was also ADP-ribosylated by Pγ- and transducin-depleted membranes (76 μg of protein). After various amounts of these peptides (0.05–0.6 μg) were ADP-ribosylated (1 h, 33 °C) in 100 μl of Buffer G containing [adenylate-32P]NAD (10 μm; ∼0.25 μCi), 40 μl of the reaction mixtures was spotted onto 2 × 2-cm pieces of Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose (32Casnellie J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Then, all of these pieces were washed five times with 400 ml of 1% trichloroacetic acid, rinsed with ethanol, and the radioactivity of each paper was measured. ADP-ribosylation of agmatine (20 mm) was carried out in a manner similar to that described above. ADP-ribosylated agmatine was isolated as described previously (33Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11352-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Samples (100 μl) were applied to AG 1-X2 columns (1 ml) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5). [32P]ADP-ribosylated agmatine was eluted with 5 ml of water. Although the amounts of components in each reaction mixture were slightly different (see each figure legend), ADP-ribosylated Pγ was prepared by incubation of purified Pγ, Pγ- and transducin-depleted ROS membranes, and [adenylate-32P]NAD. ADP-ribosylated Pγ was isolated using a Pep RPC column (see Fig. 2) or SDS-gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 3). In the case of the Pep RPC column, the same volume of 0.2m formic acid was added into the sample to terminate the reaction, and the mixture was heated for 5 min at 80 °C. Then, the sample was centrifuged (345,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The process of the Pγ extraction by formic acid was repeated two times. The pooled supernatant was applied to a Pep RPC HR5/5 column that had been equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution of Pγ was carried out with an acetonitrile gradient (0–60%) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, as shown in Fig. 2. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the fraction volume was 0.5 ml. Following measurement of both radioactivity and Pγ activity in each fraction, the active fractions were dried, suspended in water, and kept at −80 °C. In the case of SDS-gel electrophoresis, samples were heated with SDS-sample buffer to terminate the reaction. The gel was stained in 20% methanol containing 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Blue and 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid (20 min) and destained with 30% (v/v) methanol (1 h). The visualized Pγ was excised from the gel. To identify ADP-ribose in the radiolabeled Pγ, the radiolabeled frog Pγ was incubated with glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 10.0) or treated with snake venom phosphodiesterase, as shown in Fig. 3. After centrifugation of these reaction mixtures (345,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), supernatants were applied with ADP-ribose (100 μm) or AMP (100 μm) to a Mono Q column that had been equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0). After washing the column, radioactive compounds were eluted. Chromatographic conditions were: A, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0); and B, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) and 0.2m NaCl; 0–100% B in 16 ml on a linear gradient. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the fraction volume was 0.5 ml. Fifty μl of ADP-ribosylated recombinant bovine Pγ (0.2 mg/ml) was injected into a high performance liquid chromatography system that consisted of Ultrafast Microprotein Analyzer model 600 (Microm BioResources, Auburn, CA) equipped with a Reliasil C18 reverse phase column (5 μm particle size, 300 Å pore size, 1.0 × 150 mm) with a flow rate 40 μl/min. Chromatographic conditions were: A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile, H2O; and B, 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile, H2O, 0–56% B in 25 min on linear gradient. The flow was monitored at 215 nm, and the eluate was introduced directly into an API-III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an electrospray atmospheric pressure ionization source. The tuning and calibration were done using polypropylene glycol. The mass spectrometer was set to scan in a positive ion mode at orifice potential of 90 V fromm/z = 500–2,200 with a mass step of 0.4 Da. The mass data were analyzed by MacSpec 3.22 (Perkin-Elmer Sciex). Activities of PDE and Pγ were assayed as described (12Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTPase activity of Tα and GTPγS binding to Tα were measured as described (18Yamazaki A. Stein P.J. Chernoff N. Bitensky M.W.

When [adenylate-32P]NAD was present in the electrophoresis, the gel was cut above the dye front to remove free radioactive NAD for the reduction of background in autoradiography.

https://openalex.org/W2051353269,"The c-erbB-2 gene overexpression plays a major role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Binding studies detected a nuclear matrix protein (NMP) in human breast tumor tissues that recognizes a matrix attachment region (MAR) in the immediate vicinity of the c-erbB-2 gene promoter. This NMP is expressed in breast tumor tissues and cell lines along withc-erbB-2, but is not found in corresponding normal tissues. Furthermore, when NMP purified from the breast tumors by its affinity to the MAR sequence is added to nuclear extracts of breast cancer cells, it selectively stimulates the binding of the NF-κB transcription factor to DNA. A model is suggested in which the association of the MAR-like sequence with the nuclear matrix raises the local concentration of the specific NMP, which in turn interacts with the nuclear factor NF-κB to increase its local level. Such a complex could explain at a molecular level the “increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity” often observed in c-erbB-2- andBRCA1-positive human breast tumors.

To better understand the progression of breast tumorigenicity in c-erbB-2-expressing tumors, an attempt was made to study its mechanism within the innermost nuclear structure, the nuclear matrix, through DNA-protein interaction. Nuclear matrix is believed to play critical roles in regulating many key biological reactions in the nucleus such as: gene transcription, DNA replication, DNA organization, and RNA splicing and processing. In this study, we show that a nuclear DNA-binding protein is a breast tumor-specific nuclear matrix protein (NMP) 1The abbreviations used are: NM, nuclear matrix; NMP, nuclear matrix proteins; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MAR, matrix-attachment region. 1The abbreviations used are: NM, nuclear matrix; NMP, nuclear matrix proteins; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MAR, matrix-attachment region. that recognizes a nonconventional matrix attachment region (MAR) in the c-erbB-2 gene promoter. The NMP protein stimulates the binding of NF-κB to DNA in nuclear extracts from breast cancers, suggesting a possible role in breast cancer progression.RESULTSTo better understand the progression of breast tumorigenicity inc-erbB-2-expressing tumors, an attempt was made to study the possible involvement of protein interactions with DNA within the innermost nuclear structure, the nuclear matrix. To test for novel factor(s) in the nuclear matrix that bind to a specific segment of thec-erbB-2 gene regulatory sequences, MAR binding studies were conducted with many distinct segments of 5′-upstream regulatory regions of c-erbB-2 enhancer-promoter (Fig.1 A) and nuclear matrix preparations from human normal, c-erbB-2-expressing tumor breast biopsy tissues and breast cancer cell lines (33Cockrill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Results (Fig. 1 B) indicate that of the four regions tested, only one specific region, rich in GGA repeats (−79/−22) and in the immediate vicinity of thec-erbB-2 gene transcription start site, has the specific binding affinity observed only with the nuclear matrices of tumor tissues (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) and not with the normal tissues (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). This observation was further confirmed in the breast tumor cell line BT-20 (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). The upstream region that contains a stretch of AT-rich sequences (conventionally a part of MAR) binds less effectively to the nuclear matrix than the GGA-rich region (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Breast tumor and BT-20 cell nuclear matrices binding with the GGA-rich DNA element were tested with more stringent conditions by using increasing amounts of a competitor E. coli DNA, where the GGA-rich DNA element still appears to be the dominant bound material (Fig. 1 C, lane 3, breast tumor NM, lane 4, BT-20 NM with 200 μg/ml E. coli DNA versus lanes 1 and2 of same NMs with 100 μg/ml E. coli DNA). A Southern blot analysis with DNAs from tissue nuclear matrices further demonstrates a strong binding with GGA-rich DNA probe (Fig. 1 D, lane 2), not observed with the nonspecific (−22/+9) DNA probe. DNA from normal breast nuclear matrix failed to show any affinity with either probes (Fig. 1 D, lane 1). These results (Fig.1 B–D) demonstrate the presence of a MAR-like DNA element within the immediate upstream of c-erbB-2 promoter. These sequences are rich in GGA and not in AT, which traditionally is part of, but not a prerequisite for, MAR. This GGA-rich region (−79/−22) has also been mentioned as an activator of gene promoter and an alternate transcription start site region of the c-erbB-2gene (35Ibaraki K. Robey P.G. Young M.F.

Solubilized NMPs devoid of intermediate filaments (29Fey E.G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) from several normal (benign), tumor breast biopsy tissues and breast cancer cell line, BT-20, were mixed with the radiolabeled GGA-rich DNA probe, in DNA binding assays. The DNA binding EMSA clearly demonstrates a strong DNA-protein complex formation only with the NMPs of breast tumors (Fig. 2 A, panels a–c, lanes 2, 4, 6) and not with NMPs of their normal breast tissue counterparts (Fig. 2A, panels a–c, lanes 1, 3, 5). The tumor cell line BT-20 displays the same complex as the tumor tissue NMP (Fig. 2 A, panel d, lane 8), while no such complex is observed with a normal breast cell line MCF-10A (Fig. 2 A, panel d, lane 7). Different groups have reported the presence of MAR-binding proteins, such as: SATB1, OCT-1, nucleolin, and recently from human breast carcinomas (26Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell.

The arrow indicates the position of the DNA-protein complex formation, with maximum DNA binding activity shown in lanes 5 (NMP) and 4 (NM) and the least DNA binding activity shown in lanes 1, 2, and3 (cytoplasmic, nuclei, and nuclear extracts, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether this binding activity of NMPs from breast tumors is a specific phenomenon, we examined the status of NMP binding with other region of c-erbB-2 (−22/+9). Again the gel shift assay from two more sets of breast tumor, but not breast normal NMPs clearly demonstrates the formation of a specific DNA-protein complex only with the GGA-rich, −79/−22, DNA probe (Fig. 2 B, panel a, lanes 2 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 3; BT-20 NMP,lane 6 versus MCF10A NMP, lane 5). No binding is observed in these NMP extracts with other DNA (−22/+9) probe (Fig.2 B, panel b). These results were supported by an SouthWestern blot assay (Fig. 2 C), probed with the same two DNA probes. The MAR-like GGA probe (−79/−22) identifies a dominant nuclear matrix protein of 68 kDa, seen only in the breast tumor NMPs and not in their normal counterparts (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2 and4 over lanes 1 and 3 as well as in BT-20 NMP, lane 5). The second DNA probe (−22/+9) fails to demonstrate any binding. Furthermore, we investigated whether this binding activity of GGA with breast tumor NMPs is localized in the nuclear matrix domain only or is a general phenomenon, found in other compartments of the cell. Results (Fig. 2 D) of a DNA binding assay (EMSA) with GGA-rich probe and breast tumor extracts show an optimized binding activity with the nuclear matrix (lane 4) and solubilized nuclear matrix proteins (lane 5) in comparison with cytoplasmic extract (lane 1), nuclei (lane 2) and nuclear extract (lane 3). A slower migrating intense DNA-protein complex seen only in the nuclei (lane 2) and nuclear extract (lane 3) could probably be due to CAAT and TATA (as well as some other unknown)-binding proteins, since the specific probe (−79/−22) also contains CAAT and TATA binding sequences. This complex is totally absent from the nuclear matrix compartment (lanes 4 and5), affirming the fact that the nuclear matrix is devoid of these high-salt-sensitive nuclear factors.Together, the results of Figs. 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate the presence of a MAR-like non-conventional (rich in GGA and not in AT) element in the close vicinity of the c-erbB-2 gene transcription start site, whose attachment to the breast nuclear matrix is mediated by a sequence-specific DNA-binding NMP that is expressed only in the malignant tissues and breast cancer cell line BT-20 and not in the normal breast tissues.To elucidate a functional role(s) of the identified NMP factor, we affinity-purified the protein from the breast tumor NMP pools on the GGA-rich DNA (−79/−22) affinity column. The purified NMP from breast tumors displays a dominant polypeptide of 68 kDa (Fig.3 A, panel a, lane 2). This purified NMP binds the GGA-rich (specific) probe in a sequence-specific manner, as demonstrated by SouthWestern (Fig. 3 A, panel b) and EMSA (Fig. 3 B) assays. GGA-rich (specific) probe observes a strong band with 50 ng of purified NMP and 10 μg of breast tumor NMP pools (Fig. 3 A, panel b, lanes 2 and 1, respectively), while the nonspecific (−22/+9) DNA probe fails to bind these NMPs. The EMSA result (Fig. 3 B) with 50 ng of purified NMP displays the same DNA-protein complex (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) as in breast tumor NMP pools (10 μg, lane 2), which is competed out with specific (GGA-rich, −79/−22) cold DNA (lane 4), but not with nonspecific (−22/+9) cold DNA (lane 5).Figure 3DNA affinity purification of the MAR-specific NMP from the human breast tumor NMP pools.

The purified NMP was added to the nuclear extracts from various tumor cell lines in an EMSA binding reaction, using defined DNA probes from c-erbB-2, BRCA1, exon 1 regulatory sequences, and NF-κB binding sequences (see “Materials and Methods,” “Oligonucleotide Probes”). Addition of increasing amounts of purified NMP into MDA-MB231 and BT-20 nuclear extracts and with DNA probe (−22/+9) of c-erbB-2does not have any effect on the DNA-protein complex formation (Fig.4 A, lanes 2–4 versus lane 1). Similarly addition of NMP into these extracts and with DNA probe (−78/−42) ofBRCA1 also does not influence the DNA-protein complex (Fig.4 B, lanes 2–4 versus lane 1). Interestingly, addition of purified NMP to these nuclear extracts and with NF-κB binding DNA probe appears to have a selective stimulatory effect on the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor NF-κB (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–4 versus lane 1 and lanes 6–8 versus lane 5). Cold competition with κB DNA (lane 9), with mutant κB DNA (lane 10), and with anti-p65 antibody (lane 11) confirm the specificity of the NF-κB complex. This increase in NF-κB binding activity appears to be highly selective, which is not observed with other two probes (of −22/+9 of c-erbB-2 and −78/−42 ofBRCA1) tested (Fig. 4, A and B). Purified NMP factor alone does not bind to κB or any other probe except its specific GGA-rich recognition sequence (−79/−22).Figure 4Purified NMP from breast tumor tissues stimulates NF-κB DNA binding activity in breast cell nuclear extracts in a specific manner. EMSA was performed with three labeled oligonucleotide probes: −22/+9 of c-erbB-2 promoter (A), −78/−42 of exon 1 of BRCA1 (16Khanuja P.S. Lehr J.E. Soule H.D. Gehani S.K. Noto A.C. Choudhury S.

The top band in C is the specific NF-κB complex. Unlike in A and B, a gradual increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity in C is observed due to the addition of the purified NMP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further evaluate whether NF-κB is present in the nuclear matrix of breast tissues, we performed a Western blot analysis of the nuclear matrix preparations from normal and tumor breast tissues, which were subsequently probed with anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies of NF-κB. As per our prediction, reasonable amounts of NF-κB (p65 as well as p50) subunits were found preferentially associated with the breast tumor nuclear matrix (Fig. 5 A, panel a; lane 2 in both panels) and not with the normal breast nuclear matrix (Fig. 5 A, panel a; lane 3 in both panels). Lane 1in both panels are standard control p65 and p50 peptides. To demonstrate that equal amounts of proteins were used, we silver-stained a parallel gel with these samples and also performed a Western blot assay with a control anti-human nuclear matrix antibody. The results of the silver stain (Fig. 5 A, panle b) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 A, panel c) confirm that equivalent amounts of protein were used from the tumor (lane 2) and normal (lane 3) breast tissue nuclear matrices. Additionally, we also performed a NF-κB-specific Western blot analysis with the total nuclear content along with the nuclear matrix from the breast tumor tissue. The results of Fig. 5 B clearly demonstrate that a much smaller yet a reasonable fraction of total nuclear NF-κB is associated with the nuclear matrix (Fig. 5 B, panel a, lane 3 versus lane 2). A silver stain of the nuclear extract (lane 2) and nuclear matrix (lane 3) are shown underneath (Fig. 5 B, panel b) to show that equivalent amounts of protein were used for the analysis.Figure 5NF-κB protein is preferentially found on the nuclear matrix of breast tumors.

https://openalex.org/W1965283425,"Vaccinia topoisomerase binds duplex DNA and forms a covalent DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl) protein adduct at the sequence 5′-CCCTT↓. The enzyme reacts readily with a 36-mer CCCTT strand (DNA-p-RNA) composed of DNA 5′ and RNA 3′ of the scissile bond. However, a 36-mer composed of RNA 5′ and DNA 3′ of the scissile phosphate (RNA-p-DNA) is a poor substrate for covalent adduct formation. Vaccinia topoisomerase efficiently transfers covalently held CCCTT-containing DNA to 5′-OH-terminated RNA acceptors; the topoisomerase can therefore be used to tag the 5′ end of RNA in vitro.Religation of the covalently bound CCCTT-containing DNA strand to a 5′-OH-terminated DNA acceptor is efficient and rapid (k rel > 0.5 s−1), provided that the acceptor DNA is capable of base pairing to the noncleaved DNA strand of the topoisomerase-DNA donor complex. The rate of strand transfer to DNA is not detectably affected by base mismatches at the 5′ nucleotide of the acceptor strand. Nucleotide deletions and insertions at the 5′ end of the acceptor slow the rate of religation; the observed hierarchy of reaction rates is as follows: +1 insertion > −1 deletion > +2 insertion ≫ −2 deletion. These findings underscore the importance of a properly positioned 5′-OH terminus in transesterification reaction chemistry, but they also raise the possibility that topoisomerase may generate mutations by sealing DNA molecules with mispaired or unpaired ends.

Vaccinia topoisomerase, a 314-amino acid eukaryotic type I enzyme, binds and cleaves duplex DNA at a specific target sequence, 5′-(T/C)CCTT↓ (1Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1796-1803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11372-11379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage is a transesterification reaction in which the Tp↓N phosphodiester is attacked by Tyr-274 of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl) protein adduct (4Shuman S. Kane E.M. Morham S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9793-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The covalently bound topoisomerase catalyzes a variety of DNA strand transfer reactions. It can religate the CCCTT-containing strand across the same bond that was originally cleaved (as occurs during the relaxation of supercoiled DNA) or it can ligate the strand to a heterologous acceptor DNA 5′ end, thereby creating a recombinant molecule (5Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16755-16758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sekiguchi J.

Duplex DNA substrates containing a single CCCTT target site have been used to dissect the cleavage and strand transfer steps. A cleavage-religation equilibrium is established when topoisomerase transesterifies to DNA ligands containing ≥18 bp 1The abbreviation used is: bp, base pair(s). of duplex DNA 3′ of the cleavage site (8Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol.

The reaction is in equilibrium because the 5′-OH-terminated distal segment of the scissile strand remains poised near the active site by virtue of the fact that it is stably base paired with the nonscissile strand. About 20% of the CCCTT-containing strand is covalently bound at equilibrium (11Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). “Suicide” cleavage occurs when the CCCTT-containing substrate contains six or fewer base pairs 3′ of the scissile bond, because the short leaving strand dissociates from the protein-DNA complex. In enzyme excess, >90% of the suicide substrate is cleaved (11Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The suicide intermediate can transfer the incised CCCTT strand to a DNA acceptor. Intramolecular strand transfer occurs when the 5′-OH end of the noncleaved strand of the suicide intermediate attacks the 3′ phosphotyrosyl bond and expels Tyr-274 as the leaving group. This results in formation of a hairpin DNA loop (5Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intermolecular religation occurs when the suicide intermediate is provided with an exogenous 5′-OH-terminated acceptor strand, the sequence of which is complementary to the single strand tail of the noncleaved strand in the immediate vicinity of the scissile phosphate (5Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of an acceptor strand, the topoisomerase can transfer the CCCTT strand to water, releasing a 3′-phosphate-terminated hydrolysis product, or to glycerol, releasing a 3′-phosphoglycerol derivative (12Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the hydrolysis and glycerololysis reactions are much slower than religation to a DNA acceptor strand, the extent of strand transfer to non-DNA nucleophiles can be as high as 15–40%. The specificity of vaccinia topoisomerase in DNA cleavage and its versatility in strand transfer have inspired topoisomerase-based strategies for polynucleotide synthesis in which DNA oligonucleotides containing CCCTT cleavage sites serve as activated linkers for the joining of other DNA molecules with compatible termini (13Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32678-32684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the ability of the vaccinia topoisomerase to cleave and rejoin RNA-containing polynucleotides. It was shown previously that the enzyme did not bind covalently to CCCTT-containing molecules in which either the scissile strand or the complementary strand was composed entirely of RNA (9Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore the pentose sugar specificity of the enzyme, we have prepared synthetic CCCTT-containing substrates in which the scissile strand is composed of DNA- and RNA-containing halves. In this way, we show that the enzyme is indifferent to RNA downstream of the scissile phosphate, but it does not form the covalent complex when the region 5′ of the scissile phosphate is in RNA form. Also, we assess the contribution of base pairing by the 5′ end of the acceptor strand to the rate of the DNA strand transfer reaction. CCCTT-containing 36-mer oligonucleotides containing a single internal 32P-label at the scissile phosphate were prepared by ligating two 18-mer strands (synthetic RNA or DNA oligonucleotides) that had been hybridized to a complementary 36-mer DNA strand. The sequence of the proximal CCCTT-containing 18-mer strand was 5′-CATATCCGTGTCGCCCTT as DNA or 5′-CAUAUCCGUGUCCCUU as RNA. The sequence of the distal 18-mer strand was 5′-ATTCCGATAGTGACTACA as DNA or 5′-AUUCCGAUAGUGACUACA as RNA. The distal 18-mer strand was 5′-labeled in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then gel-purified. The sequence of the 36-mer strand was 5′-TGTAGTCACTATCGGAATAAGGGCGACACGGATATG. The strands were annealed in 0.2 m NaCl by heating at 65 °C for 2 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The molar ratio of the 5′-labeled distal 18-mer to the proximal 18-mer and the 36-mer strand in the hybridization mixture was 1:4:4. The singly nicked product of the annealing reaction was sealed in vitro with purified recombinant vaccinia virus DNA ligase (14Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16138-16147Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The ligation reaction mixtures (400 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMnCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 pmol of 5′32P-labeled nicked substrate, and 160 pmol of ligase. After incubation for 4 h at 22 °C, the reactions were halted by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. The samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform, and the labeled nucleic acid was recovered from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation. The 36-mer duplex products were dissolved in TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Ligation of the labeled 18-mer distal strand to the unlabeled CCCTT-containing 18-mer strand to form an internally labeled 36-mer product was confirmed by electrophoresis of the reaction products through a 17% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The extents of ligation [36-mer/(36-mer + 18-mer)] were as follows: DNA-p-DNA, 88%; DNA-p-RNA, 67%; and RNA-p-DNA, 66%. Recombinant vaccinia topoisomerase was expressed in bacteria and purified via phosphocellulose and SP5PW column chromatography as described (16Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures for assay of covalent adduct formation contained (per 20 μl) 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 pmol of 36-mer duplex, and 1 pmol of topoisomerase. The reactions were initiated by adding topoisomerase and halted by adding SDS to 1% final concentration. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Covalent complex formation was revealed by the transfer of radiolabeled polynucleotide to the topoisomerase polypeptide (3Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11372-11379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of adduct formation was quantitated by scanning the gel using a FUJIX BAS1000 phosphorimager and was expressed as the percentage of the input 5′32P-labeled 36-mer substrate that was covalently transferred to protein. An 18-mer CCCTT-containing DNA oligonucleotide (5′-CGTGTCGCCCTTATTCCC) was 5′ end-labeled in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, then gel-purified and hybridized to a complementary 30-mer strand to form the 18-mer/30-mer suicide cleavage substrate. Covalent topoisomerase-DNA complexes were formed in a reaction mixture containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 pmol of 18-mer/30-mer DNA, and 2.5 pmol of topoisomerase. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The strand transfer reaction was initiated by the addition of an 18-mer acceptor strand, 5′-ATTCCGATAGTGACTACA (either DNA or RNA), to a concentration of 25 pmol/20 μl (i.e. a 50-fold molar excess over the input DNA substrate), while simultaneously the reaction mixtures were adjusted to 0.3 m NaCl. The reactions were halted by addition of SDS and formamide to 0.2 and 50%, respectively. The samples were heat-denatured and then electrophoresed through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The extent of strand transfer (expressed as the percentage of input labeled DNA converted to a 30-mer strand transfer product) was quantitated by scanning the wet gel with a phosphorimager. A 36-nucleotide run-off transcript was synthesized in vitro by T3 RNA polymerase from a pBluescript II-SK(−) plasmid template that had been linearized by digestion with endonuclease EagI. A transcription reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mmspermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm UTP, 6.25 μm [α32P]GTP, 5 μg of template DNA, and 100 units of T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction was halted by adjusting the mixture to 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m ammonium acetate. The samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. The pellet was resuspended in formamide and electrophoresed through a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea in TBE. The radiolabeled 36-mer RNA was localized by autoradiography of the wet gel and eluted from an excised gel slice by soaking for 16 h at 4 °C in 0.4 ml of buffer containing 1m ammonium acetate, 0.2% SDS, and 20 mm EDTA. The eluate was phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The RNA was resuspended in TE. Dephosphorylation of the RNA 5′ terminus was carried out in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 pmol of 36-mer RNA, and 30 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the mixture was phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The phosphatase-treated 36-mer transcript was repurified electrophoretically as described above. Vaccinia topoisomerase does not bind covalently to CCCTT-containing RNA duplexes, nor does it form a covalent complex on RNA-DNA hybrid duplexes in which one of the two strands is RNA (9Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that the failure to form a covalent adduct on a CCCUU-containing RNA strand was not caused by uracil substitution for the thymine bases in the CCCTT sequence (9Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand why vaccinia topoisomerase does not form a covalent complex with all-RNA strands, we prepared 36-bp duplex substrates in which the scissile strand was a tandem RNA-DNA or DNA-RNA copolymer and the noncleaved strand was all DNA (Fig. 1). These duplexes were uniquely labeled with 32P at the scissile phosphodiester. The substrate molecules were constructed by annealing two 18-mer oligonucleotides (one of which had been 5′32P-labeled) to a complementary 36-mer DNA strand to form a singly nicked duplex. The 5′-labeled 18-mer strand was then joined to the unlabeled CCCTT-strand (or CCCUU strand) in a reaction catalyzed by vaccinia virus DNA ligase. (The properties of vaccinia ligase in joining RNA and DNA strands will be described elsewhere.) The 36-mer duplex products were isolated and then used as substrates for vaccinia DNA topoisomerase. We will refer to these substrates as DNA-p-DNA, DNA-p-RNA, and RNA-p-DNA, with the labeled phosphate being denoted by p.Figure 1Topoisomerase cleavage of DNA-p-RNA and RNA-p-DNA strands. The 36-bp substrate used in the cleavage reactions is shown, with the 32P-labeled scissile phosphate indicated by the filled circle. The segments of the top strand flanking the scissile phosphate, which are either DNA or RNA, are bracketed; the bottom strand is all DNA. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 pmol of substrate (either DNA-p-RNA or RNA-p-DNA), and topoisomerase as indicated were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Covalent adduct formation (% of input label transferred to the topoisomerase) is plotted as a function of the amount of enzyme added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transesterification by topoisomerase at the CCCTT site will result in covalent binding of a 3′ 32P-labeled 18-mer oligonucleotide to the enzyme. The extent of covalent complex formation on the DNA-p-RNA substrate in 10 min was proportional to input topoisomerase; 80–85% of the 36-mer strand was transferred to the topoisomerase at saturating enzyme (Fig. 1). The same level of topoisomerase covalently bound less than 1% of the RNA-p-DNA 36-mer strand. Hence, the topoisomerase tolerated RNA substitution downstream of the scissile phosphate but was impeded from forming the covalent adduct when the CCCTT sequence was in RNA form. We assessed the kinetics of the covalent binding reaction at a saturating level of topoisomerase (Fig. 2). An all-DNA 36-mer (DNA-p-DNA) was bound to an end point of 21% in 2 min (Fig.2 A). The apparent cleavage-religation equilibrium constant (K cl = covalent complex/noncovalent complex) was 0.26, which agrees with the values of 0.2–0.25 that were reported previously for equilibrium cleavage of a 5′ end-labeled CCCTT-containing DNA substrate (10Petersen B.Ø. Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The DNA-p-RNA 36-mer was bound covalently to an end point of 80% in 5 min (Fig. 2 A and other data not shown). The apparent equilibrium constant for DNA-p-RNA (K cl = 4) was significantly higher than that observed for the all-DNA ligand. The RNA-p-DNA 36-mer was transferred to the topoisomerase, albeit very slowly. After 4 h, 4% of the CCCUU-containing RNA strand was bound covalently to the enzyme (Fig. 2 B). An end point was not established in this experiment. However, by comparing the initial rate of covalent adduct formation on RNA-p-DNA (0.04% of input substrate cleaved per min) to the amount adduct formed on DNA-p-DNA at the earliest time point (12% in 10 s), we estimate that RNA substitution of the CCCTT-portion of the substrate slowed the rate of covalent complex formation by about 3 orders of magnitude. Rejoining of the cleaved strand occurs by attack of a 5′-hydroxyl-terminated polynucleotide on the 3′-phosphodiester bond between Tyr-274 and the CCCTT site. This transesterification step can be studied independent of strand cleavage by assaying the ability of a preformed topoisomerase-DNA complex to religate the covalently held strand to a heterologous acceptor strand (5Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To form the covalent topoisomerase-DNA donor complex, the enzyme was initially incubated with a suicide substrate consisting of a 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer scissile strand (CGTGTCGCCCTTATTCCC) hybridized to a 30-mer strand. Cleavage of this DNA by topoisomerase is accompanied by dissociation of the 6-nucleotide leaving group, ATTCCC. With no readily available acceptor for religation, the enzyme is essentially trapped on the DNA as a suicide intermediate (Fig. 3). In a 5-min reaction in enzyme excess, >90% of the 5′ 32P-labeled strand becomes covalently bound to protein. The strand transfer reaction was initiated by adding a 50-fold molar excess of an 18-mer acceptor strand (either DNA or RNA) complementary to the 5′ single-strand tail of the covalent donor complex (Fig. 3) while simultaneously increasing the ionic strength to 0.3 m NaCl. Addition of NaCl during the religation phase promotes dissociation of the topoisomerase after strand closure and prevents recleavage of the strand transfer product. Ligation of the covalently held 12-mer CGTGTCGCCCTT to the 18-mer yields a 32P-labeled 30-mer (Fig. 4, lane 1). The suicide intermediate transferred 94% of the input CCCTT-containing strand to the 18-mer DNA strand (Fig. 3). The extent of religation at the earliest time point (5 s) was 90% of the end point value. We calculated from this datum a religation rate constant (k rel) of >0.5 s−1. We had determined previously (from experimental values for k cl and K eq at 37 °C) a k rel value of ∼1.3 s−1 (18Cheng C. Wang L.K. Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 pmol of 5′-labeled suicide DNA cleavage substrate, and 2.5 pmol of topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Strand transfer was then initiated by adding a 50-fold excess of the acceptor DNA (18-mer D; lanes 1 and 2) or acceptor RNA (18-mer R; lanes 5 and 6) while simultaneously adjusting the mixtures to 0.3 m NaCl. The religation reactions were quenched after a 10-min incubation by adding SDS to 0.2%. The samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. The pellets were resuspended in either 12 μl of 0.1 m NaOH, 1 mm EDTA (NaOH+) or 12 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA (NaOH−). These samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Control samples containing the input 18-mer DNA substrate that had not been exposed to topoisomerase were treated in parallel (lanes 3 and 4). The alkali-treated samples were neutralized by adding 1.2 μl of 1 m HCl. All samples were then ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in formamide, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and electrophoresed through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. An autoradiograph of the gel is shown. The positions of the 30-mer religation product and the 18-mer input strand are indicated at the left. Alkaline hydrolysis of the RNA strand transfer reaction product (lane 6) yielded a discrete species denoted by the asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Topoisomerase readily ligated the covalently held 12-mer DNA to an 18-mer RNA acceptor to form a 30-mer product (Fig. 4, lane 5). 89% of the input CCCTT-strand was transferred to RNA, with 40% of the end point value attained in 5 s. We used this datum to estimate a rate constant of 0.1 s−1 for single-turnover strand transfer to RNA. Thus, religation to DNA was about 10 times faster than religation to RNA. The slowed rate of RNA religation is likely to account for the observed increase in the cleavage-religation equilibrium constant (K eq =k cl/k rel) on the DNA-p-RNA 36-mer. The predicted product of strand transfer to RNA is a 30-mer tandem DNA-RNA strand (5′-CGTGTCGCCCTTAUUCCGAUAGUGACUACA) uniquely32P-labeled at the 5′ end. The structure of this molecule was confirmed by analysis of the susceptibility of this product to treatment with NaOH. The labeled 30-mer RNA ligation product was converted nearly quantitatively into a discrete species that migrated more rapidly than the input 18-mer CCCTT-containing DNA strand (Fig. 4,lane 6). The mobility of this product was consistent with a chain length of 13 nucleotides. The expected 32P-labeled alkaline hydrolysis product of the RNA strand transfer product is a 13-mer (5′-CGTGTCGCCCTTAp). Control reactions showed that neither the 32P-labeled 18-mer scissile strand of the suicide substrate nor the 30-mer product of strand transfer to DNA was susceptible to alkali (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 2). We conclude that topoisomerase can be used to ligate RNA to DNAin vitro. Practical applications of topoisomerase-mediated strand transfer to RNA include the 5′ tagging of RNA transcripts. Bacteriophage RNA polymerases have been used widely to synthesize RNA in vitro from plasmid DNA templates containing phage promoters. To test whether such transcripts were substrates for topoisomerase-catalyzed ligation, we constructed a CCCTT-containing suicide cleavage substrate that, when cleaved by topoisomerase, would contain a 5′ single-strand tail complementary to the predicted 5′ sequence of any RNA transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase from a pBluescript vector (Fig. 5). A 36-nucleotide T3 transcript was synthesized in a transcription reaction containing [α32P]GTP. The RNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate the 5′ terminus. The topoisomerase-DNA covalent intermediate was formed on an unlabeled suicide substrate. Incubation of the radiolabeled T3 transcript with the suicide intermediate resulted in the conversion of the 36-mer RNA into a novel species that migrated more slowly during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). The apparent size of this product (48 nucleotides) was indicative of ligation to the 12-mer CCCTT DNA strand. The kinetics of DNA ligation to the T3 transcript are shown in Fig. 5. The reaction was virtually complete within 1 min; at its end point, 29% of the input RNA had been joined to DNA. No DNA-RNA ligation product was formed in reaction containing a T3 transcript that had not been treated with alkaline phosphatase (not shown). The acceptor polynucleotides used in the experiments described above were capable of hybridizing perfectly with the 5′ single-strand tail of the topoisomerase-DNA donor complex. It had been shown previously that the vaccinia virus topoisomerase is capable of joining the CCCTT-strand to an acceptor oligonucleotide that hybridizes so as to leave a single nucleotide gap between the covalently bound donor 3′ end and the 5′ terminus of the acceptor. Religation across this gap generated a 1-base deletion in the product compared with the input scissile strand (5Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme also catalyzes strand transfer to an acceptor oligonucleotide that, when hybridized, introduces an extra nucleotide between the donor 3′ end and the penultimate base paired nucleotide of the acceptor. Religation in this case will produce a 1-base insertion (5Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion and insertion formation in vitro have also been documented for mammalian type I topoisomerase (19Henningfeld K.A. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, there has been no report of the effects of acceptor strand gaps and insertions on the rate of strand joining by these enzymes. We assessed the kinetics of strand transfer by the vaccinia topoisomerase covalent intermediate to acceptor oligonucleotides that base pair with the donor complex to form either a fully base-paired 3′ duplex segment or 3′ duplexes with a 1- or 2-nucleotide gap. 84% of the input DNA substrate was ligated to the fully paired acceptor in 10 s, the shortest time analyzed (Fig.6 A). The size of the strand transfer product was 30 nucleotides, as expected (Fig. 7, lane 3). No 30-mer product was formed in the absence of the added acceptor strand (Fig. 7, lane 2). Religation across a 1-nucleotide gap was highly efficient, albeit slow. 85% of the input substrate was joined across a 1-nucleotide gap to yield the expected 29-nucleotide product (Fig. 6 A and Fig.7, lane 4). The kinetic data in Fig. 6 fit well to a single exponential with an apparent rate constant of 0.005 s−1. Thus, single-turnover strand closure by topoisomerase across a 1-nucleotide gap was 2 orders of magnitude slower than the rate of joining across a fully paired nick. Vaccinia topoisomerase catalyzed strand transfer across a 2-nucleotide gap to form the anticipated 28-nucleotide product (Fig. 7, lane 5), but this reaction was feeble (Fig. 6 A). We observed linear accumulation of the 2-nucleotide gap product over a 2-h incubation, at the end of which only 10% of the input DNA had been joined. We estimated, based on the initial rate, that religation across the 2-nucleotide gap was 2 orders of magnitude slower than joining across a 1-nucleotide gap (and hence 4 orders of magnitude slower than the rate of joining across a nick). Similar experiments were performed using DNA acceptors that contained either 1 or 2 extra nucleotides at their 5′ ends (Fig. 6 B). Religation to these acceptors yielded labeled strand transfer products of 31 and 32 nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 7, lanes 6 and7). 90% of the input DNA was religated to form the 1-nucleotide insertion product (Fig. 6 B). We calculated a rate constant of 0.04 s−1 for religation with 1-nucleotide insertion. A similar end point was achieved in the formation of a 2-nucleotide insertion product, but the strand transfer rate was considerably slower (Fig. 6 B). The observed rate constant for 2-nucleotide insertion was 0.001 s−1, i.e.3 orders of magnitude lower than k rel at a nick. We examined strand transfer by topoisomerase to a set of 18-mer acceptors that were capable of forming"

Deletion analysis indicated that the N-terminal half of Tfa1 protein has an essential function to support the cell growth. In a temperature-sensitive tfa1 mutant cell, the steady-state level of bulk poly(A)+ RNA decreased rapidly at the restrictive temperature. Surprisingly, levels of several mRNAs, whose transcription is directed by the promoters lacking the typical TATA sequence, were not affected in the mutant cells at that temperature. This promoter-specific functioning of TFIIE was reproduced in a cell-free system composed of TFIIE-depleted nuclear extracts. These results strongly suggest that requirement for TFIIE varies in each gene depending on the promoter structures in vivo.

These results strongly suggest that requirement for TFIIE varies in each gene depending on the promoter structures in vivo. Recent biochemical studies in yeast, fruit fly, and mammalian cells have led to reconstitution of the basal transcription machineryin vitro with RNA polymerase II and so-called general transcription factors, namely TATA-binding protein (TBP), 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA binding protein; TF, transcription factor; ts, temperature-sensitive; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA binding protein; TF, transcription factor; ts, temperature-sensitive; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase. TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH (1Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 2Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

These components are highly conserved, and in some cases, functionally interchangeable among the above organisms. However, exactin vivo functioning of some of the components under real physiological conditions remains to be elucidated. These issues can be best addressed in yeast, the organism that offers powerful genetic approaches that are not available in other eukaryotes. For this reason,in vivo requirement for some of the general transcription factors have been studied by genetic methods in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. TBP has been concluded to be required for transcription by all three nuclear RNA polymerases (5Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Two subunits of TFIIH, which is also involved in nucleotide excision repair processes (for review, see Ref. 6Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), have been shown to be essential for mRNA synthesis of most genes in the cell (7Qiu H. Park E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Guzder S.N. Qiu H. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S.

In addition, genetic studies have also suggested that TFIIB and TFIIF are involved in the accurate start site selection (10Pinto I. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Cell. 1992; 68: 977-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Sun Z.-W. Hampsey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The general transcription factors together with RNA polymerase II assemble on the core promoter, which consists of both or either the TATA box and the initiator (12Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), to generate the preinitiation complex. The formation of the complex is supposed to be amenable for regulation by sequence-specific DNA-bound transcription factors (2Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 3Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Recently, the preinitiation complex has been suggested to be formed from a pre-formed subcomplex called holoenzyme of RNA polymerase II (for review, see Refs. 13Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar and 14Bjorklund S. Kim Y.-J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II holoenzyme contains some of the general transcription factors and multifunctional transcription regulators such as Srb proteins, Swi/Snf proteins, Gal11, Sin4, Rgr1, and more than a dozen as yet unidentified proteins (13Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Bjorklund S. Kim Y.-J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By using temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations in the SRB4 and SRB6 genes, it has been indicated that the holoenzyme is involved in transcription of most RNA polymerase II transcribed genes (15Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the yeast Gal11 protein makes functional contact with TFIIE in vivo as well as in vitro (16Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have further found that Gal11 is required for full expression of certain genes bearing the TATA box but is dispensable for initiator- or nonconsensus TATA-directed transcription in vivo (17Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). From these results, we hypothesized that the yeast TFIIE could also exhibit such a promoter element-specific functioning. Indeed, as we describe here, TFIIE shows differential effects on different promoters in S. cerevisiae. Implications of these findings in our understandings of the molecular mechanism for transcriptional initiation are discussed. Plasmid pSK495, a URA3-marked centromeric plasmid expressing hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-taggedTFA1 open reading frame (ORF) under the control of theADH1 promoter, was constructed by replacing theTFA2 ORF of pSK461 (16Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with the blunt-endedNdeI-BamHI fragment of pET-TFA1 (18Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H. Brickner J.H. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27549-27553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pSK492 was constructed by subcloning the blunt-endedSphI fragment of pSK495 into the PvuII sites of pRS314, a TRP1-marked centromeric plasmid (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids bearing 3′ end deletion derivatives of TFA1 were constructed from pSK492 by digestion with exonuclease III from the 3′ end of theTFA1 ORF. Yeast strain HS30 (MATα ade2–1 leu2–1, 112 trp1–1 ura3–1 can1–100 tfa1::ADE2 (pSK495)) was a chromosomal tfa1null strain harboring pSK495. Strain HS33 was identical to HS30 except for the presence of pSK492 instead of pSK495. Strain HS34 was a chromosomal tfa2 null derivative (tfa2::LEU2) of HS33 harboring pSK461 in addition to pSK492. Rich media consisted of 2% polypeptone and 1% yeast extract containing 2% glucose (YPD), 2% galactose (YPGal), 2% sucrose(YPSuc), 2% glycerol (YPGly), or 2% sodium lactate plus 3% glycerol (YPGlyLac) as carbon sources. Minimal medium consisted of 2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base. Minimal medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) was prepared as described (20Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Plasmid bearing full-length (pSK492) or 3′ end deletion derivatives of TFA1was introduced into yeast strain HS30. Transformants were selected for Trp+ and then replica-plated on a 5-FOA plate to isolate cells expressing full-length or 3′ end deletion derivatives ofTFA1 on the TRP1-marked vector (20Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutations in TFA1 were isolated as follows. The TFA1 ORF in pSK492 was mutagenized by a primer chain reaction technique (15Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mutagenized fragments were isolated by digestion with NheI (in the HA epitope sequence) andNspV (nucleotide position +597) (18Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H. Brickner J.H. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27549-27553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were recloned into pSK492 vector at the NheI-NspV site. The mutant library thus prepared was introduced into HS30, and the resultant Trp+ transformants were grown on 5-FOA plates at 30 °C to eliminate the preexisting URA3-marked plasmid bearing the wild-type TFA1. Clones that failed to grow on YPD at 37 °C were selected by replica-plating as the candidates. Total RNA was isolated as described (17Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6819-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. The integrity of the RNA preparations was confirmed by methylene blue staining of RNA after agarose gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The amounts of poly(A)+ RNA were determined by hybridization with a labeled poly(T) probe as described (15Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The relative poly(A)+ RNA levels were determined by scintillation counting of the dot-blotted filter. Primer extension analyses were carried out as described (17Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The sequences of primers are as follows: ACT1, ACCGTTATCAATAACCAAAGCAGC; ADH1 (10Pinto I. Ware D.E. Hampsey M.

Primary transcripts of therRNA and tryptophan tRNA(tRNAW) genes were analyzed by S1 nuclease mapping technique. The probe oligonucleotides used were labeled with32P at processed RNA regions to detect nascent transcripts as described (5Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The relative RNA levels were determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms (Shimadzu, CS-9000). The ORFs of the wild-type and mutant TFA1 genes were cloned into pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and expressed in Escherichia coli cells, from which proteins tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST) were prepared. Each of the fusion proteins GST-Tfa1 and GST-tfa1-21 was immobilized on glutathione-agarose and incubated with a bacterial extract containing Tfa2 (18Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H.

Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) containing 0.1m potassium acetate. After extensive washing with the same buffer, proteins retained on the resin were eluted with SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Whole cell extracts were prepared by disruption of cells with glass beads. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (16Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of protein from each sample were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with an ECL detection system (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). One mg of nuclear protein prepared from HS34 was incubated with control or anti-HA antibody immobilized protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) in buffer E containing 0.3m potassium acetate for 5 h on a rotating wheel. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, the resultant supernatant was recovered for in vitro transcription reaction, which was carried out as described previously (21Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6819-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Template DNAs (20 μg/ml) used were pG80–72 (GAL80) and pSK164 (GAL7), and the transcripts were analyzed by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension, respectively (21Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6819-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Yeast TFIIE consists of the 66- and 43-kDa subunits, which are encoded by the TFA1and TFA2 genes, respectively (18Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H. Brickner J.H. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27549-27553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23383-23387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both genes are essential for cell viability (18Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H. Brickner J.H. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27549-27553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first determined the Tfa1 region essential for the in vivo function. Several 3′ end deletion derivatives of TFA1 were constructed (Fig.1 A) and introduced into yeast cells by a plasmid shuffling technique (20Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the transformants harboring N-189, which produces a peptide of amino acid residues from 1 to 189 of Tfa1, grew in the absence of wild-typeTFA1. By contrast, derivatives with further deletions toward the N terminus (i.e. N-185 and N-168H) could not support cell growth. The cells harboring N-189 grew normally on rich media containing 2% glucose, 2% galactose, 2% sucrose, or 2% glycerol as a sole carbon source at 30 °C. These cells could also grow at 37 °C. However, N-242 but not N-189 could support cell growth at 16 °C (Fig. 1 C). These results show that the N-terminal peptide of 189 amino acids is sufficient to support cell growth and that the region from 190 to 242 has an important function for growth of yeast at 16 °C.Figure 3Growth and RNA synthesis in cells bearing ts mutation in TFA1. A, growth of wild-type andtfa1–21 cells. At the time indicated by thearrow, the cultures of HS33 (wild-type) andtfa1–21 cells grown in YPD medium at 30 °C were shifted to 37 °C. B, RNA levels in wild-type and mutant cells after the temperature up-shift. The wild-type (HS33) andtfa1–21 cells were grown in YPD medium. At the indicated times, aliquots of cells were removed, and total RNA was prepared. The integrity of the RNA samples was confirmed by methylene blue staining of RNA (Total RNA). Equal amounts of RNA (2 μg) were dot-blotted on a filter and hybridized with radioactively labeled poly(T) probe to detect poly(A)+ RNA.

A, schematic representation of C-terminal deletion derivatives of Tfa1. Tfa1 has a zinc finger (ZF, 124–152) and acidic regions (Acidic, 374–402 and 463–482) (18Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A.

The barsrepresent deleted forms of Tfa1, and the number of the C-terminal amino acid of each deletion derivative is indicated to the left, after N-. The last H in N-168H means that a histidine residue is created at the C terminus during construction of the deletion.

The cells harboring TFA1 derivatives (104 cells) were spotted on plates of rich media containing the indicated carbon sources and incubated at 30 °C under aerobic or anaerobic conditions.

Total RNA prepared from cells harboring wild-type or N-189 TFA1 was subjected to primer extension analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, quantitation of the autoradiograms by densitometric analysis showed that the level of constitutive transcription of ACT1, ADH1,CYH2, or DED1 in cells harboring N-189 was practically equal to the corresponding level in cells harboring the wild-type TFA1. To know whether the N-terminal domain of 189 amino acids are sufficient for activated transcription, the levels of uninduced or induced transcription (for review, see Ref. 24Struhl K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 1051-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) ofGAL7, GAL80 (both activated by Gal4),TRP5, HIS3 (both activated by Gcn4), andCYC1 (activated by Hap complex) were analyzed (Fig.2 B). Under the uninducing conditions, the mRNA levels of these genes were not affected by the C-terminal deletion. Activated transcription of GAL7, TRP5, or CYC1was observed in cells harboring N-189 to levels indistinguishable from those in the wild-type cells. The N-terminal fragment of 189 amino acids could also support activated transcription of GAL80and HIS3, but the levels reduced to one-third of the wild-type levels. These results together with the above observations on the capability to support the cell growth suggest that the N-terminal domain of 189 amino acids have an essential function of Tfa1 but may not be sufficient for full expression of certain genes. To investigate the requirement for TFIIE for transcription in vivo, we isolated ts mutations inTFA1. The region containing the N-terminal domain ofTFA1 of essential function (amino acid residues from 1 to 200) was mutagenized by a primer chain reaction technique in vitro, and the mutant library was introduced into yeast cells. We isolated a recessive ts mutant, tfa1–21, that failed to grow at 37 °C but grew normally at 30 °C (see “Experimental Procedures”). After the temperature shift of a logarithmically growing culture of tfa1–21 cells to 37 °C, the cell growth ceased rapidly (Fig. 3 A). To analyze effect of tfa1–21 mutation on transcription directed by RNA polymerase II, the amount of total poly(A)+ RNA was determined by hybridization with a radioactively labeled-poly(T) probe. Although this approach measures the steady-state level of mRNAs in average, the amount may reflect an average level of newly synthesized mRNAs because half-lives of S. cerevisiaemRNAs are relatively short (2.5–45 min) (25Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3,B and C, the level of bulk poly(A)+ RNA declined sharply in tfa1–21 cells after the shift to 37 °C. Such a drastic change in the poly(A)+ RNA level was not seen in cells harboring the wild-type TFA1. We also investigated effect of tfa1–21 mutation on rRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I and tryptophan tRNA (tRNAW) synthesis by RNA polymerase III. The amounts of primary transcripts ofrRNA and tRNAW were determined by S1 nuclease mapping with the respective probes labeled with32P at processed regions (5Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Within 1 h after the temperature up-shift, the amount of the rRNA andtRNAW transcripts did not change significantly in both wild-type and tfa1–21 cells but then gradually decreased more remarkably in tfa1–21 than in wild-type cells (Fig. 3, B and C). This synthetic pattern of the rRNA or tRNAW transcripts was similar to that previously reported in yeast bearing a ts mutation inRPB1 encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (5Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar,15Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 26Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We assume that the observed effect of the tfa1–21mutation may be an indirect consequence of defective transcription by RNA polymerase II rather than direct involvement of Tfa1 in transcription directed by RNA polymerase I or RNA polymerase III. To determine the amount of specific transcripts from individual promoters, total RNA used in the above experiments was subjected to primer extension analysis with specific primers (Fig.4). The mRNA levels of ACT1,ADH1, CYH2, or DED1 were slightly lower in tfa1–21 cells than in the wild-type cells even at the permissive temperature (Fig. 4 A), and the temperature up-shift resulted in a drastic reduction of the amount of these transcripts in the mutant cells. The MFα1 transcript was sharply diminished after the shift to the restrictive temperature. The level of TRP5 mRNA fell down gradually and became undetectable at 4 h after the temperature up-shift. Taking into account the mRNA decay rate (see the legend of Fig. 4), the steady-state level of the respective mRNA may be taken approximately as its rate of synthesis. In contrast to the transcripts studied above, synthesis of certain transcripts appeared rather refractory to the loss of TFIIE function (Fig. 4). 1) The amount of one of the two species of HIS3mRNA, which starts at +1, did not significantly change in the mutant cells grown at the restrictive temperature, whereas the amount of the other species, which starts at +13, rapidly decreased to an undetectable level within 3 h after the temperature up-shift. The former is directed by a nonconsensus TATA element that is used when the transcription is inefficient, for example, in histidine-abundant environment while the other is directed by the canonical TATA box, which is used when the transcription proceeds efficiently, for example, in histidine-deficient conditions (27Mahadevan S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4447-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 2) The constitutive transcription of GAL80 is known to be initiated at the +1 site, which is dependent on the initiator element (21Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6819-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The level of +1 transcript reduced to 60% the original level within the initial 0.5 h, and then remained unchanged at least for 4 h. 3) The level of two species of mRNA from GAL4, which contains neither the TATA or TATA-like sequences nor any other known core promoter elements (29Griggs D.W. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4999-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), slightly decreased but was detectable even at 4 h after the temperature up-shift. To study the effect of tfa1–21 mutation on the basal in comparison with the activated transcription in HIS3 andGAL80, we prepared total RNA from the wild-type ortfa1–21 yeast grown in uninducing as well as inducing conditions before and after the temperature shift (Fig.5). Transcription of HIS3 is preferentially initiated at the +13 site in the induced (or derepressed) state (27Mahadevan S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4447-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,28Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In agreement with the experiment of Fig. 4, the temperature up-shift of tfa1–21 cells resulted in a rapid disappearance of +13 transcript but no change in +1 transcript. In galactose-grown cells, transcription of GAL80 is initiated at a set of downstream sites that depends on the typical TATA element in addition to the +1 site (21Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6819-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). At the restrictive temperature,tfa1–21 cells showed a rapid reduction in the level of the downstream transcripts. By contrast, the amount of +1 transcript was slightly reduced by the temperature up-shift and then remained unchanged at least for 4 h. Under the identical conditions, the level of GAL7 mRNA, whose synthesis is directed exclusively by the canonical TATA sequence (30Tajima M. Nogi Y. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), decreased rapidly after the temperature up-shift. Considering the half-life of the respective mRNA described in the figure legends, we conclude that the amount of the transcripts studied above represented its rate of synthesis. The mutant Tfa1 protein contains two amino acid substitutions, Ser at 68 to Pro and His at 103 to Leu. Both alterations cooperatively contribute to the ts phenotype of tfa1–21cells (data not shown). The mutational sites are located within a region that has been implicated in interaction with the small subunit in the human homologue (31Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We then analyzed interaction of Tfa1 with Tfa2, the small subunit of TFIIE, by protein affinity chromatography. Fusion proteins of GST and the wild-type or mutant Tfa1 were immobilized on glutathione-agarose and incubated with a bacterial extract containing Tfa2 protein. After extensive washing of the resin, bound proteins were extracted and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. As shown in Fig. 6 A, Tfa2 protein was retained on GST-Tfa1 resin but not on GST-tfa1–21 resin. This result clearly demons"

Members of the Rho family of small GTPases have been shown to be key components in the transduction of extracellular signals to the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian cells resulting in focal adhesion and stress fiber formation (Rho-like proteins), membrane ruffling (Rac-like proteins), and filopodia formation (Cdc42-like proteins) (1Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

In addition to these effects on the cytoskeleton, the Rho GTPases are involved in various other cellular processes. Activation of Rho type GTPases leads to activation of MAP kinase pathways and progression of the cell cycle through G1 (4Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Rac is also an essential component for the induction of phagocytosis in neutrophils (5Abo A. Pick E. Hau A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 6Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), and in fibroblasts, it is has been suggested to regulate pinocytosis (2Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar) while Rho has been shown to be involved in endocytosis (7Schmalzing G. Richter H.-P. Hansen A. Schwarz W. Just I. Aktories K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Murphy C. Saffrich R. Grummt M. Gournier H. Rybin V. Rubino M. Auvinen P. Luttcke A. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 384: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All small GTPases of the Ras superfamily cycle between a GTP and GDP bound state, and this cycling is a key feature of their biological activity (9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). A variety of proteins that regulate this cycling has been characterized and include GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase activating protein; GEF, nucleotide exchange factor; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; GDI, nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; PH, pleckstrin homology; DH, dblhomology; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s). nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (10Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized classes of interacting/regulatory proteins for small GTPases are the GAPs, which accelerate the intrinsic GTPase rate. RhoGAP was the first GAP for the Rho family of GTPases to be described biochemically and cloned (11Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Harris P.M. Self A.J. Brill S. van Erp H.E. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1137-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, two other proteins were immediately identified as potential rhoGAPs (bcr and n-chimaerin) and were later shown to have GAP activity (12Diekmann D. Brill S. Garrett M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A. Nature. 1991; 351: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This highly conserved region of sequence homology has been the key for identifying potential new rhoGAP proteins, and with only one exception (the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), these proteins have all been shown to have GAP activity (13Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 14Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In general, rhoGAPs are unspecific in that they have GAP activity toward more than one member of the Rho family though they are generally inactive toward Ras or members of other small GTPase families (with the exception of CeGAP and RLIP76, both of which have been suggested to bridge the Ras pathway (15Barfod E.T.

The rhoGAP domain is approximately 150 amino acids in length and is most often situated toward the C terminus of these proteins. RhoGAPs range in size from 34 kDa to >150 kDa and contain additional regions that are involved in protein-protein interactions, including SH2 and SH3 domains, proline-rich regions (SH3-binding motifs), or lipid interaction (pleckstrin homology (PH) domain). Two rhoGAPs (bcr and abr) also contain a region of homology (known as the DH domain) to the dbl oncogene, a GEF, and this domain has exchange activity toward Rho GTPases (17Chuang T.-H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The role of GAP as an upstream negative regulator is evident in studies done both in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical assays have established that GAP accelerates the intrinsic GTPase rate, thereby converting the Rho protein from the active GTP bound form to its inactive GDP-bound form. Microinjection of different rhoGAP proteins into serum-starved 3T3 fibroblasts showed that they were able to block induction of stress fibers (p190GAP and rhoGAP) and membrane ruffles (bcr) (18Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the case of Rac-stimulated NADPH oxidase, the p190GAP has been shown to inhibit superoxide formation and subsequently phagocytosis in neutrophils (19Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Settleman J. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Other potential functions of GAPs are less well defined. The fact that GAP proteins have a variety of domains that are involved in protein-protein interactions that are not necessary for their GAP activity implies that they do at least interact with other proteins, and whether this is part of their function as negative regulator or part of some effector-like role is not yet clear. The slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum is a professional phagocyte (23Vogel G. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that feeds by ingestion of bacteria and other particles in a fashion similar to mammalian leukocytes or neutrophils. D. discoideum is amenable to molecular and genetic techniques and has a well characterized cytoskeleton in addition to phagocytic and pinocytic pathways. These features make it a good model system in which to study Rac-related pathways. Three Rac1/2 homologs (Rac1A, Rac1B, and Rac1C) have been described in D. discoideum (20Bush J. Franek K. Cardelli J. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 136: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These proteins have over 90% identity to each other and over 80% identity to the human Rac1/2 GTPases (20Bush J. Franek K. Cardelli J. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 136: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, five more GTPases have been described, RacA, B, C, D, and E (20Bush J. Franek K. Cardelli J. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 136: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Larochelle D.A. Vithalani K.K. De Lozanne A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1321-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These proteins have the most homology to human Rac, especially in the N-terminal 100–120 amino acids but are not close homologs to human Rho or Cdc42. Although the exact functions of the D. discoideum Rac proteins are unknown, RacE has been shown to be involved in cytokinesis (21Larochelle D.A. Vithalani K.K. De Lozanne A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1321-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), indicating that these proteins will also be important in regulating cytoskeletal-dependent events. We report here the cloning of a rhoGAP homolog from D. discoideum, which we have called DdRacGAP since all the Rho-related GTPases described to date in D. discoideum have been designated as Racs based on their high degree of primary sequence homology to the human Rac proteins. The putative protein product is quite large at approximately 150 kDa. The GAP domain shows 20–25% identity to other rhoGAPs and is situated at the N terminus of the protein, which is an unusual location for this domain. The protein also has an SH3 domain and a proline-rich region containing several potential SH3 binding motifs and/or sites for proline-directed protein kinases. Like bcr and abr, DdRacGAP also has a DH domain abutted by a PH domain. We have also shown that the GAP domain is active on bothD. discoideum and human Rho family GTPases but not human Ras. All restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from Boehringer Mannheim. Taq polymerase and buffers were from Cetus. All radiochemicals were from Amersham Int. Sequencing was done using the Sequenase version. 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For rac1A and racC fromD. discoideum, oligonucleotides were prepared corresponding to the published cDNA sequences (20Bush J. Franek K. Cardelli J. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 136: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which also created a 5′BamHI and a 3′ EcoRI restriction enzyme site. These oligonucleotides were used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the cDNAs from a D. discoideum λGT11 cDNA library (CLONTECH), which were subsequently cloned into BamHI-EcoRI-digested pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and sequenced to ensure no errors had accurred. The Q61L mutation in Rac1A was introduced by 2-step PCR as described (22Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene. 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). For DdRacGAP expression, two oligonucleotides, designed to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the λGT11 cDNA clone which also created a BamHI site at each end, were used in PCR to amplify the insert DNA. The DNA fragments were cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX2T. Initially, it was not clear that the ATG at bp 35 did encode the start codon so the GST fusion protein contains additional amino acids (GFDCFDIKK) before the initial methionine. Escherichia coli cells harboring the various pGEX2T plasmid constructs were grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.6–0.8 cm−1 and then induced by addition of IPTG to 0.1 mm for 16–18 h at 23 °C. GST-tagged proteins were affinity purified and thrombin cleaved at 4 °C according to the following procedure. E. coli cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h, and the soluble protein fraction was passed over a 10-ml GST-agarose column and then washed with buffer A until theA 280 was <0.05 cm−1. Protein was eluted by cleavage with thrombin (10 units/ml) (Sigma) for 10 h at a flow rate of 0.08 ml/min in wash buffer containing 2.5 mmCaCl2, and the thrombin was removed by passage of the eluate over a 3-ml p-aminobenzamidine-agarose (Sigma) column. Peak fractions were concentrated using a Centricon-10 (Amicon), and protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). The purity of the small GTPases was greater than 90%, and the purity of DdRacGAP was about 30% (see “Results and Discussion”), as judged by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides (5′-dAAAACITTITTACGTGAATTACCA and 5′-dAACAGCTAAITTIGTITTIGTCATTTTITT), corresponding to the KLFLRELP and NKMTNTNLAV, conserved amino acids in blocks 2 and 3, respectively (see Fig. 2 A), were used in PCR amplification to isolate GAP homologous DNA fragments from a D. discoideum λGT11 cDNA library (CLONTECH). The amplification protocol was as follows: 1 cycle of 92 °C for 2 min, 43 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; 10 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and finally 10 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The DNA fragments were cloned intoEcoRV-digested Bluescript vector (Stratagene) and sequenced. The DNA from a positive clone was [α-32P]dCTP-labeled with the Ready to Go kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and used as a probe to screen the λGT11 cDNA library. The cDNA clone insert was 677 bp and included the initial methionine to amino acid 212. For genomic DNA cloning in each case, DNA of the appropriate size was gel-purified after digestion with restriction enzymes and separation on a 0.8% agarose gel. The DNA fragments were ligated to gel-purified pBluescript after digestion with the same restriction enzymes and treatment with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The ligations were transformed into Ultracompetent XL1-BLUE cells (Stratagene), and the entire library was screened using either radiolabeled EcoRI-SpeI DNA (for genomic DNA clones 1 and 2) or SpeI-ClaI DNA (for genomic DNA clone 3) as a probe. The inserts were sequenced on both strands from approximately 500 bp upstream of the start codon to 200 bp downstream of the stop codon. The sequences of all PCR-amplified DNA fragments were checked against this genomic DNA sequence to ensure that no errors had occurred.Figure 2Alignment of GAP, DH, PH, and SH3 domains.

Labeled protein was separated from free nucleotide using a PD-10 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5). The peak fractions containing protein (about 1 ml) were pooled and aliquots counted in a Beckman LS7000 scintillation counter to determine concentration of Rho·[α-32P]GTP. For GAP assays, 100-μl reaction mixtures containing 2 nm[α-32P]GTP labeled protein, 1 mm ATP, and either assay buffer for control reactions or dilutions of GAP protein were incubated at 15 °C. Samples (10 μl) were removed at intervals, and the nucleotide was separated from the protein by the addition of perchloric acid to 0.5%. The samples were brought to approximately pH 4 by adding sodium acetate to 140 mm, centrifuged briefly to remove the protein, and the nucleotide solution (representing 2–4 μl of the original 100-μl reaction volume) was spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Sigma). Nucleotides were separated by eluting the plate with 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4, and the plates were then dried in air and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amounts of [α-32P]GDP and [α-32P]GTP were quantified using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). To clone GAP homologs from D. discoideum, we used a PCR-based approach. Two oligonucleotides, corresponding to conserved sequences KLYLRELP in block 2 and NKMTNTNLAV in block 3, in rhoGAPs (see Fig. 2 A) were prepared and used as primers to amplify from DNA isolated from aD. discoideum cDNA library. DNA products of approximately 200 bp were cloned and sequenced, and one isolate showed homology to rhoGAP. This PCR fragment was then used as a probe to isolate a cDNA clone from the λGT11 library, which was approximately 700 bp and included the start codon (Fig.1 B, the underlined amino acids correspond to those encoded by the cDNA clone). As introns inD. discoideum are generally short and easily identifiable, the remaining 5′ promoter region and 3′ coding sequences were isolated in three overlapping genomic DNA clones: Clone 1, the 2.0-kbXhoI-SpeI fragment containing the promotor and first 180 amino acids; Clone 2, the 2.0-kbEcoRI-ClaI fragment; and Clone 3, the 4.5-kbSpeI fragment containing the stop codon (Fig.1 A). Fig. 1 A shows the organization of the DdracGAP gene and Fig. 1 B shows a schematic diagram of putative protein product and the amino acid sequence. DdRacGAP has several interesting protein homologies in addition to the GAP domain (Fig. 1 B), including an SH3 domain and a DH-PH domain homology. The presence of an SH3 domain is unusual in the rhoGAP family of proteins as it is only seen in two members known to date (p85, the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (13Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and the hematopoietic C1 protein (24Tribioli C. Droetto S. Bione S. Cesareni G. Torrisi T.R. Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Toniolo D. Pelicci P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). The DH-PH combination is seen in all RhoGEFs and in many oncogene products (36Quilliam L. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), several of which have been shown to have exchange activity for Rho GTPases, but only two other GAPs (bcr and abr) have this homology in addition to the GAP activity although several rhoGAPs have the PH domain alone (13Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Another feature is the long stretches of asparagine, threonine, and serine (amino acids ∼330–440, see Fig. 1 B), which is commonly seen in D. discoideum proteins and is of unknown function. The location of the GAP domain (abutting the N terminus) is unique compared with all other rhoGAPs, but the significance, if any, of this is unknown. Fig. 2 A shows the alignment of the GAP homology domain. The highest degree of homology is to bcr (27% identity) and n-chimaerin (23% identity), both active on Rac but not Rho. Recently, the structure of the rhoGAP has been solved (25Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the structure implicates the potential importance of one amino acid in particular, Asn-391 in rhoGAP, which is present in all active GAPs but absent in p85. This amino acid is also present in the DdRacGAP (Asn-162). The DH domain alignment is shown in Fig. 2 B. The highest homology was to the FGD-1 protein (21% identity) and to the RhoGEF domain of RasGRF (20% identity), and while the identity todbl, bcr, and vav is only around 10–12%, DdRacGAP does have almost all of the highly conserved amino acids in the three structurally conserved regions (SCRs) indicative of this domain (see Fig. 2 B) (10Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). We have not yet been able to test whether this domain is active as an exchange factor as shown with the bcr and abr proteins (17Chuang T.-H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) since this assay requires post-translationally processed Rho protein. All of the Rho exchange factors have a PH domain located C-terminal to the DH domain, and this is also the case with the DdRacGAP as seen in Figs. 1 B and2 C. The PH domain homology was very low (<10% identity), but the Blitz search did identify several proteins containing PH domains. The alignment shown in Fig. 2 C indicates the six main homology blocks based on an alignment of 45 PH domains (26Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), and many of the key conserved amino acids are present in DdRacGAP. PH domains are thought to be involved in intracellular localization of proteins via their varying affinity for different types of lipids (27Shaw G. Bioessays. 1995; 18: 35-46Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, it was shown that the PH domain of dblwas not necessary for interaction with GTPases but was important for its transforming activity (28Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). DdRacGAP also contains an SH3 domain that is just C-terminal to the GAP homology domain (Fig. 2 D). DdRacGAP showed 20–25% identity to the SH3 domains of a variety of other proteins, and again the amino acids most highly conserved are for the most part conserved in DdRacGAP (Fig. 2 D). SH3 domains are known to bind proline-rich sequences approximately 10 amino acids in length. Finally, there is a region rich in proline (amino acids 450–770, see Fig. 1 B), suggesting either SH3 binding motifs (present in several other rhoGAPs) or target sequences for proline-directed Ser/Thr kinases. The presence of SH3 and PH domains and a proline-rich region, all commonly found in molecules involved in signal transduction, in addition to the DH domain, suggest that DdRacGAP interacts with other proteins and may have other functions, possibly as part of a larger protein complex as is becoming a recurring theme in the biological activity of many small GTPases (10Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). To determine whether the GAP domain can in fact accelerate the intrinsic GTPase rate of any of the D. discoideum Rac proteins, we expressed and purified the N-terminal fragment containing the GAP domain (amino acids 1–212 of DdRacGAP) from E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). Over 95% of the expressed protein was insoluble even when the cells were grown at 23 °C, but the remaining soluble protein was isolated to about 30% purity. The major contaminants were at 60 and 70 kDa and are most likely the E. coli proteins groEL and dnaK, respectively (29Thain A. Gaston K. Jenkins O. Clarke A.R. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This partially purified protein was used to characterize the DdRacGAP activity. Fig. 3 shows the results of incubation of DdRacGAP with [α-32P]GTP-labeled Rac1A and RacC. The acceleration of the initial rate of GTP cleavage by DdRacGAP was approximately 20-fold faster for the Rac1A protein than for RacC (Fig. 3 and Table I). DdRacGAP accelerates the cleavage of Rho·GTP to Rho·GDP and is not active on a Rac1A Q61L mutant (data not shown), showing that the GAP activity was not due to nonspecific phosphatase activity or any nonspecific effect of the partially purified protein or contaminating proteins.Table ISpecificity of DdRacGAPProteinGAP activity1-aGAP activity is expressed as 1/[DdracGAP] preparation required to double the intrinsic initial rate of GTP cleavage.mg/ml −1DdRac1A31DdRacC1.8HsRhoA113HsRac16.2HsN-ras<0.51-bFor ras, there was no acceleration of GTPase at the maximal concentration of GAP that could be used in the assay (1.840 mg/ml).Initial rates of GTP cleavage were measured at more than five different GAP concentrations for each protein as in Fig. 3 (except for human ras where only the maximal concentration of GAP protein was used).1-a GAP activity is expressed as 1/[DdracGAP] preparation required to double the intrinsic initial rate of GTP cleavage.1-b For ras, there was no acceleration of GTPase at the maximal concentration of GAP that could be used in the assay (1.840 mg/ml). Open table in a new tab Initial rates of GTP cleavage were measured at more than five different GAP concentrations for each protein as in Fig. 3 (except for human ras where only the maximal concentration of GAP protein was used). We further characterized the substrate specificity of the GAP domain of DdRacGAP by testing its ability to act on the human RhoA, Rac1, and Ras GTPases as shown in Table I. DdRacGAP did have GAP activity for human RhoA and Rac1 proteins but had no detectable activity on human Ras. In fact, it was about 3-fold more active on the human RhoA protein compared with the Rac1A protein, raising the possibility that Rac1A may not be the primary target in D. discoideum. Of the reportedD. discoideum Rac proteins, RacC and RacD have the least homology to the human Rac1 and D. discoideum Rac1A, 1B, and 1C proteins (about 60% identity) while RacA and RacB have about 70% identity. Since RacC and RacB were complete sequences (RacA and RacD were missing both N- and C-terminal amino acids), we intended to test both RacC and RacB in the GAP assay, but we were not able to isolate enough of RacB protein for our assay. RacC, however, was not as good a substrate as Rac1A as seen in Fig. 3 and in Table I, indicating that the DdRacGAP does exhibit some substrate specificity among the D. discoideum Racs. Comparison of the primary sequences of the D. discoideum Rac proteins indicates that, as is the case with other Rho proteins, amino acids outside of the effector loop (amino acids 32–42 of Rac1A) are important for interaction with GAP (30Self A.J. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661PubMed Google Scholar, 31Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that the effector domains of the reported D. discoideum Racs are highly conserved. In fact, the effector domains of Rac1A and RacC are identical, and yet DdRacGAP shows a strong preference for Rac1A over RacC as a substrate. In the case of rhoGAP, the use of Rho/Ras chimeras indicated that the region around amino acids 74–90 of human RhoA (loop 7 of Ras) are important for activation (30Self A.J. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661PubMed Google Scholar). It was also found that the same region of Rac is required for activation by bcr (32Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Diekmann et al. (32Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) reported that the effector domain and flanking regions of Rac (amino acids 22–46) were important for activation by bcr although the effect was much less than for the region between amino acids 74–90. The regions directly flanking the effector domain of Rac1A and RacC, in particular the amino acids C-terminal to the effector domain, are not conserved between the two proteins, and this may be a region to investigate for interaction with DdRacGAP. Rac1A and RacC also have several amino acid differences in the region corresponding to 74–90 of human RhoA in addition to a highly divergent C terminus (from approximately amino acid 120 to the end) (20Bush J. Franek K. Cardelli J. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 136: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that these are also likely to be candidate regions for interaction with DdRacGAP as is the case with several other rhoGAPs (30Self A.J. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661PubMed Google Scholar, 31Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

We have identified the first rhoGAP for the Rho small GTPases from D. discoideum. This protein has an intriguing primary structure exhibiting homology to both GAP and GEF, which is a seemingly contrary juxtaposition of functional domains, and is only seen in two other GAPs (bcr and abr). The significance of this is not yet clear but a more in depth analysis of the biochemical activity of these two domains, both together and independently, and cellular localization of DdRacGAP, will hopefully provide more information on the possible function of such a protein. Indeed, experiments analyzing the DH domain of several oncogene products have indicated that this domain itself may act as a bridge for signaling between two pathways since there are DH-containing proteins that bind to Rac without effecting nucleotide exchange but do have exchange activity for either Rho or Cdc42 (33Miki T. Smith C.L. Long J.E. Eva A. Fleming T.P. Nature. 1992; 362: 462-465Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 34Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27374-27381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One could envisage a similar scenario where DdRacGAP could bridge two pathways via its two different activities by the possibility of the GAP domain acting to turn-off a GTPase in one pathway while the GEF could activate (or at least bind) the GTPase of another. Further experiments looking at the substrates for both binding and enzymatic activities should indicate if this is a possibility. In any case, it is very important to establish what the primary targets of the GAP activity and of the DH domain are to begin to analyze this experimentally. We thank Drs. David Trentham and Anthony Magee for helpful discussions and advice and Prof. Alan Hall for the human RhoA and Rac1 expression vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2043484039,"The regulation of amino acid transport from the vacuolar reservoir into the cytoplasm has been studied in hyphal cells of <i>Penicillium cyclopium</i>. To avoid artifacts caused by the isolation of vacuoles, efflux was examined ""<i>in situ</i>,""<i>i.e.</i> in cells whose plasma membranes were permeabilized for micromolecules by a treatment with nystatin. The ATP-dependent proton gradient and amino acid transport activities at the vacuolar membrane remained intact under these conditions. Accumulation of amino acids in the vacuole proved to be the result of a dynamic equilibrium of active, ATP-dependent uptake and energy-independent efflux. The latter was strongly accelerated after the vacuolar amino acid content had surpassed a threshold level. Efflux of vacuolar amino acids was specifically controlled by extravacuolar adenylates: ATP, 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (an ATPase-resistant ATP-analogue), ADP, or AMP caused a strong inhibition in the concentration range around 200 μmol/liter, whereas both lower and higher concentrations allowed significant efflux rates. Estimates of the cytosolic adenylates (which consisted mainly of ATP) were close to 2 mmol/liter in glucose-metabolizing cells, which concentration allowed maximum rates of both vacuolar uptake and efflux. During 24 h of carbon and nitrogen starvation, the adenylate level decreased toward the efflux-inhibiting region around 200 μmol/liter, whereas 3–4 d of carbon and nitrogen starvation caused a further decline of the adenylate content, leading again to efflux-permitting concentrations. Thus, the cytosolic adenylate pool appears to effectively control the availability of vacuolar amino acids for the cellular metabolism."

In bacteria, transcriptional activation plays a pivotal role in adaptation processes. Changes in the cell's environment stimulate transcriptional activators to bind their target promoters and to induce their expression. This results in adaptation of gene expression to the environmental requirements. Transcriptional activators have recently been classified on the basis of their mechanism of interaction with RNA polymerase, leading to the definition of Class I and Class II activators (1Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to this definition, Class I transcriptional activators work by contacting the α subunit of RNA polymerase, whereas Class II activators interact with the ς factor. α and ς are also the subunits of RNA polymerase involved in specific DNA binding and promoter recognition. ς is responsible for interaction with the −35 and −10 sequences, whereas α is able to bind a third element of the bacterial promoter identified at the rrnB P1 promoter region and termed the UP element (2Ross W.

The Escherichia coli adaptive response to DNA methylation damage is induced when cells are exposed to sublethal doses of alkylating agents (3Samson L. Cairns J.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). ada is the regulatory gene of the adaptive response. The product of the ada gene, Ada, is a methyltransferase able to transfer methyl groups from damaged DNA to two of its own cysteine residues (6McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T.

Methylation of Cys-69 converts Ada into a transcriptional activator. The Cys-69-methylated Ada protein (meAda) 1The abbreviations used are:meAda, methylated Ada; bp, base pair(s). is able to recognize specific sequences upstream of its own promoter and at least two other promoters, alkA and aidB, and activate their transcription (8Teo I.

Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the α subunit of RNA polymerase binds to the promoters of the adaptive response genes ada andaidB in the absence of Ada protein (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase holoenzyme binds the two promoter regions between −60 and −40 via its α subunit; this area overlaps the meAda binding site and closely resembles the UP element of the rrnB P1 promoter with respect to location, high A/T content, and recognition by α (2Ross W.

This RNA polymerase·promoter binary complex shows only basal levels of transcription and is modified by meAda into a ternary complex competent in transcription initiation at induced levels (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The single amino acid substitution in the α DNA binding domain, R265A, which is a change from arginine to alanine at residue 265, prevents α from binding the rrnB P1 promoter (13Gaal T. Ross W.

Kondo H. Iwanaga S. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13730-13736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of observations strongly suggest that the mechanism of Ada action on thealkA promoter differs from that of the other adaptive response genes. First, methylation of Ada is not necessary foralkA induction. Overexpression of the unmethylated Adain vivo is sufficient to induce alkA(i.e. in the absence of alkylation damage) (14Nakabeppu Y. Miyata T. Kondo H. Iwanaga S. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13730-13736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

S. A. 1994; 91: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Second, the location of the Ada binding site in the alkA promoter region differs from that in theaidB and ada promoters. At the alkApromoter, meAda protects residues from −54 to −29 (16Furuichi M. Yu C.G. Anai M. Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 236: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,18Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), overlapping the −35 region. In both ada andaidB, meAda binds farther upstream, protecting sequences from −62 to −38 in DNase I protection experiments (10Landini P. Volkert M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8285-8289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Third, Ada mutants capable of activating alkAbut not ada, and vice versa, have been isolated (15Saget B.M. Shevell D.E. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1268-1274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shevell D. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9001-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Likewise, the isolated, methylated amino-terminal domain of Ada acts differently on the two types of promoters, activating alkAbut inhibiting ada (18Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this report we investigate the interaction between RNA polymerase and the alkA promoter and the effects of Ada andmeAda on this interaction. We find that 1) the RNA polymerase α subunit plays an important role in both basal and Ada-activated transcription, 2) both Ada and meAda stimulate specific binding of both RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the purified α subunit of RNA polymerase, and 3) the Ada·RNA polymerase·alkA promoter ternary complex differs from the ternary complex formed by meAda in the extent of upstream DNA binding. Restriction endonucleases were from Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]CTP were from Amersham Life Science. E. coli RNA polymerase and RNase-free DNase I were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. AnNruI/PstI (−60 to +296 of the alkAregion) fragment from pYN3072 (9Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pSL1180 (Pharmacia) using the corresponding restriction sites to obtain plasmid pMV447. To obtain pMV465, pMV447 was cut with AccI, and the vector fragment was re-ligated to delete 253 bp from the polylinker of pSL1180. For the coding strand, a HindIII/AccI (145 bp) fragment from pMV447 that contained the alkApromoter region from −60 to +24 plus an additional 61 bp of upstream vector DNA was labeled at the AccI site with [α-32P]dATP by an end-filling reaction with Klenow enzyme. For the template strand, a HindIII/EcoRI (169 bp) fragment from pMV465 that contained the same 145-bp fragment as pMV447 plus an additional 24 bp of downstream vector DNA was labeled at the HindIII site. The region downstream of −60 contained all the necessary elements for transcription and regulation ofalkA (Ref. 16Furuichi M. Yu C.G. Anai M. Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 236: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Deletion of the region upstream of −60 resulted in the loss of a second promoter that reads in the opposite direction (14Nakabeppu Y. Miyata T. Kondo H. Iwanaga S. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13730-13736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter is not regulated by the Ada protein and does not affect levels of alkAtranscription either in vivo or in vitro. 2P. Landini and M. R. Volkert, unpublished observations. The Ada protein was purified as in Saget and Walker (17Saget B. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and methylation of the Ada protein was obtained as in Nakabeppu and Sekiguchi (9Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DNase I protection and gel retardation experiments were performed in 20 μl final volume of binding buffer (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 20 min at 22 °C and processed as described previously (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Single-round in vitrotranscription experiments were performed using the linear DNA templates as follows. For the alkA promoter, aHindIII/EcoRI fragment from pMV465 (169 bp) was used. This fragment contained the same 169-bp alkA promoter fragment used in DNase I protection experiments of the template strand. The RNA transcript obtained from this fragment was 48 nucleotides in length. As a control, we used the lacUV5 promoter, a 205-bp fragment from pYN3077 (9Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), to produce an RNA transcript of 65 nucleotides. In the experimental conditions, a second RNA transcript approximately 10 nucleotides shorter was also produced, possibly from a cryptic promoter on the same DNA fragment. The sizes of the RNA transcripts were confirmed by DNA sequencing ladders run on the same gels, assuming an electrophoretic mobility 10% slower for RNA than DNA. 0.3 pmol of each promoter region were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature with 4 pmol of either wild type RNA polymerase holoenzyme or α R265A-RNA polymerase (reconstituted as in Ref. 13Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E.E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. When required, 10 pmol of unmethylated or methylated Ada were added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Methylation of Ada was performed as in Ref. 9Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, except that the amount of methylated calf thymus DNA was lowered to 0.06 μg. Transcription reactions were started by the addition of 0.1 mm each ATP, GTP, and UTP, 0.001 mm CTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 250 μg/ml heparin (final reaction volume, 50 μl). After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, 1 mm unlabeled CTP was added, and the reaction was allowed to continue for 3 min and then blocked with 50 μl of stop solution (600 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 30 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Samples were precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol, resuspended in gel loading buffer, and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. Consistent with previous reports (8Teo I. Sedgwick B. Kilpatrick M.W. McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Cell. 1986; 45: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Furuichi M. Yu C.G. Anai M. Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 236: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we observed a low level of transcription of the alkA promoter with wild type RNA polymerase in vitro in the absence of any activator protein (Fig. 2, lane 2). Both the unmethylated and the methylated forms of Ada (Ada andmeAda) stimulated in vitro transcription, although the highest levels of transcription occurred withmeAda (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). We and others have previously found that the carboxyl-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit plays a role at other Ada-activated promoters (11Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the binding site for meAda in the alkA promoter (−52 to −30, partially overlapping the −35 region) differs from that at the aidB andada promoters that have meAda binding sites extending from −36 to −60 and −40 to −64, respectively. This result combined with the results from the genetic and biochemical studies of others (11Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Saget B. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Shevell D. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9001-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) suggests that the mechanisms at these promoters may differ. We therefore asked whether the carboxyl-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit is essential for activation of transcription by Ada at the alkA promoter. We used an RNA polymerase containing the α R265A mutation. This mutant α subunit was previously shown to be defective in DNA binding and, when assembled into the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, was defective in UP element function at the rrnB P1 promoter (13Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E.E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Purified α R265A was also shown to be defective in the binding of the upstream regions of the Ada-dependent aidB andada promoters (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The α R265A-RNA polymerase was reconstituted in vitro and used in transcription ofalkA in the presence or absence of Ada and meAda (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). The activator-independent, basal level of transcription of alkA was reduced substantially by the R265A mutation (lane 6), and no activation of trancription was detected by either Ada or meAda (lanes 7 and8). The R265A-RNA polymerase transcribed thelacUV5 promoter as efficiently as wild type RNA polymerase in these reactions (compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8). Another transcript from the placUV5 fragment was also detected with wild type RNA polymerase (lanes 1–4) although not with R265A-RNA polymerase (lanes 5–8). This transcript is approximately 52 nucleotides in length and may be the result of either initiation from a weak promoter-like sequence or premature termination. Since unmethylated Ada was found to stimulate transcription by wild type RNA polymerase, but less effectively thanmeAda (Fig. 2 and Ref. 9Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that there are differences in the affinity of the two forms of the activator for the binding site in the alkA promoter. We used a gel shift assay to compare the concentrations of Ada or meAda required to observe formation of a complex with an alkApromoter fragment (Fig. 3). A meAda·DNA complex was formed that was detectable at a relatively lowmeAda concentration (0.015 μm) and required a concentration of approximately 0.05 μm for complete site occupancy. Complexes of higher mobility were also formed at high concentrations of meAda, but the nature of the interactions in these complexes is not understood. In contrast, the unmethylated form of Ada formed complexes with alkA only at a relatively high concentration (0.17–0.50 μm), and full site occupancy was not detected at the maximum concentration used. Thus, the methylated form of Ada binds the alkA site more efficiently. We previously observed that RNA polymerase alone, in the absence of meAda, protected the upstream region of the aidB and ada promoters in a complex detected by DNase I footprinting. The basal level of alkAtranscription by the wild type RNA polymerase (Fig. 2) indicates that RNA polymerase is also able to specifically recognize thealkA promoter in the absence of activator. However, we were unable to detect this RNA polymerase·alkA complex in a DNase I footprint (Fig. 4, compare lane 1with 4), presumably reflecting the instability of the complex under these conditions. Consistent with the reduced ability of the α R265A mutant RNA polymerase to carry out basal transcription ofalkA (Fig. 2), we were also unable to detect a complex of this mutant RNA polymerase with the promoter (Fig. 4, lane 7). A stable ternary complex of alkA promoter, RNA polymerase, and either Ada (Fig. 4, lane 5) or meAda (Fig.4, lane 6) was observed. The boundaries of protection conferred by the activator protein alone (−52 to −30) are seen in the footprint of meAda (Fig. 4, lane 3), consistent with previous results (18Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the unmethylated form of Ada does not bind well enough to confer clear protection in the DNase I footprints (Fig. 4, lane 2; see also Figs. 3 and 5), it does support the formation of a ternary complex with RNA polymerase and the promoter. The upstream boundaries of protection observed with Ada andmeAda containing ternary complexes differ (comparelane 5 with 6). The complex containingmeAda had an upstream boundary of −52, whereas the complex with Ada had a boundary at −43. Increasing the concentration of Ada to 2.5 μm did not convert the protection pattern exhibited by Ada to that of meAda (data not shown), suggesting that the difference in protection patterns reflects differences in the structure of the complexes, rather than degree of occupancy of the promoter. The Ada or meAda concentration dependence of formation of these complexes is examined further in Fig.5. Consistent with the inability of the mutant R265A-RNA polymerase to be activated by Ada or meAda at the alkA promoter (Fig. 2), we did not observe a ternary complex of R265A-RNA polymerase, the alkA promoter, and Ada or meAda in DNase I footprint assays (Fig. 4, lanes 8 and 9). (The protected region in lane 9 reflects binding ofmeAda (compare with lane 3).) Thus, the arginine 265 residue in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the α subunit is required for formation of the Ada- or meAda-stimulated ternary complexes. Consistent with the gel shift results of Fig. 3 indicating that only a small fraction of DNA molecules were bound by Ada, we did not detect an Ada footprint at concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.5 μm (Fig. 5, lanes 2–4). Over a comparable concentration range, meAda fully occupied itsalkA promoter binding site (Fig. 5, lanes 5–7). Although binding of unmethylated Ada protein alone was not detectable, it stimulated the formation of a ternary RNA polymerase·alkA·Ada complex at each concentration tested (Fig. 5, lanes 9–11), as did meAda (lanes 12–14). Thus, it appears that there is cooperative interaction of RNA polymerase and Ada at this promoter. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit plays a role in both basal and activated transcription at alkA (Fig. 2). The effect on basal transcription indicates that the alkA promoter contains a UP element component. Purified α subunit binds to DNA in the UP element region of several promoters, including themeAda-activated ada and aidBpromoters (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to detect complexes of purified α subunits and the alkA promoter in a gel shift assay at concentrations higher than required for complex formation at other UP elements (0.5 μm (13Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E.E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar); Fig. 6, lane 4) or in DNase I protection assays (data not shown). In the presence of purified wild type α subunit and either Ada ormeAda, complexes with mobility slower than that of the Ada or meAda binary complexes were observed, indicating a cooperative interaction of α with both forms of Ada (Fig. 6, comparelanes 5 and 6 with lanes 2 and3). The α·Ada or α·meAda complexes were not detected, however, when purified R265A mutant α subunit was used (lanes 7–9), indicating that the DNA binding function of the carboxyl-terminal domain is necessary for the formation of these complexes as well as for activation of this promoter. In a previous report (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we showed that RNA polymerase is able to contact the promoters of the adaptive response genes adaand aidB via binding of the α subunit to the −40 to −60 region in the absence of the transcriptional activatormeAda. At these promoters, binding of meAda converts the RNA polymerase·promoter complex into a ternary complex competent for induced levels of transcription initiation. At theada and aidB promoters, only meAda functions as an inducer, and its role in activation is to isomerize a binary complex of RNA polymerase bound to an upstream site via α subunit contacts; binding of meAda alters the nature but not the affinity of RNA polymerase binding, leading to complete promoter protection and induced transcription (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The alkApromoter differs from ada and aidB promoters in several respects. Both forms of the Ada protein activatealkA transcription (9Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and stimulate complete protection of the alkA promoter region by RNA polymerase (Fig. 4,lanes 5 and 6). RNA polymerase alone binds thealkA promoter too weakly to afford clear DNase I protection, but both forms of Ada activator enhance RNA polymerase binding to thealkA promoter. Thus, the role for meAda at thealkA promoter is fundamentally different from its role at other Ada-dependent promoters. Although RNA polymerase is unable to bind the alkA promoter in the absence of Ada at levels sufficient to afford clear protection from DNase I (Fig. 4, lane 4), it can specifically interact with the alkA promoter region, resulting in low levels of transcription in vitro (Fig. 2, lane 2) and providing a basal level of expression of alkA in vivo(21Volkert M.R. Gately F.H. Hajec L.I. Mutat. Res. 1989; 217: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The region of alkA bound by meAda extends from −52 to −30 (Ref. 18Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and Fig. 4, lane 3). The weak binding displayed by unmethylated Ada in the absence of RNA polymerase does not allow a determination of its binding site. The −52 to −30 area includes the recognition sequence we have recently proposed for methylated Ada, AATnnnnnnGCAA (where n represents the part of the sequence that varies) (10Landini P. Volkert M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8285-8289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which in the alkA promoter spans between −46 and −34 (Fig. 1). The binding affinity of unmethylated Ada to the alkA promoter region in the ternary complex is increased at least 25-fold (Fig. 5) by the presence of RNA polymerase. Unlike the unmethylated protein, meAda binding affinity to the alkA promoter region is not affected by RNA polymerase in this concentration range (Fig. 5). Differences between Ada· and meAda·RNA polymerase·alkA promoter ternary complexes are clearly detectable in DNase I protection experiments in the −40 to −60 areas (Fig. 4). These differences appear to be qualitative rather than quantitative, since different DNase I protection patterns are produced even in the presence of a large excess of unmethylated Ada (2.5 μm, data not shown). We suggest that different DNase I protection patterns reflect different conformations of RNA polymerase and/or promoter DNA in the two ternary complexes. Despite these differences, both unmethylated and methylated Ada share the ability to stimulate α binding and trigger more efficient transcription initiation. In contrast to what is seen at the ada and aidBpromoters, the α subunit of RNA polymerase does not bind thealkA promoter in the absence of the Ada protein; however, the presence of either Ada or meAda together with α results in formation of ternary complexes detectable in band shift experiments (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6). The requirement for the binding of Ada protein to the alkApromoter for α binding raises the possibility that alkApromoter activation may result from recruitment of α to its binding site, which in turn allows RNA polymerase to bind the appropriate core promoter elements. Ada- and meAda-stimulated binding of α could be mediated by protein-protein interaction of α with Ada andmeAda; an alternative possibility is that binding of Ada ormeAda might facilitate binding of α to a specific DNA site in the alkA promoter. The observation that the DNA binding-defective R265A mutant α subunit is not able to bind thealkA promoter region even in the presence ofmeAda is consistent with this hypothesis. Promoters have already been described in which the α subunit is able to specifically bind DNA in the −40 to −60 area upon binding of transcriptional activators: in the gal P1 promoter, for instance, binding of the catabolite repressor protein induces upstream binding of α (22Attey A. Belyaeva T. Savery N. Hoggett J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). DNase I protection assays performed on themeAda·α·alkA promoter ternary complex indicate that α does not extend the area of protection provided bymeAda (data not shown), suggesting that the α binding site overlaps the meAda binding site and is therefore indistinguishable in DNase I protection experiments. Overlapping sites for α and meAda have already been observed at both theada and aidB promoters (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The R265A mutation of α impairs RNA polymerase binding to thealkA promoter in the presence of Ada, as determined by DNase I protection experiments (Fig. 4) and almost completely abolishes basal and activated transcription from the alkA promoter (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that the α subunit plays an important role in the formation of the RNA polymerase·alkA promoter binary complex and that α binding is necessary for uninduced, basal levels of alkA transcription. This finding is apparently a contradiction with the lack of binding observed with the purified α subunit (Fig. 6). However, additional interactions between the promoter and the other subunits of RNA polymerase may enhance or stabilize α binding when it is part of the holoenzyme. Indeed, differences in concentration needed for DNA binding by the α subunit alone and α assembled into RNA polymerase have already been described (2Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At the alkA promoter, the binding of RNA polymerase subunits in other areas of the promoter might provide stabilization of α binding. Moreover, the requirement of Ada or meAda for α subunit binding suggests that the different role for Ada in activation ofalkA predicted from genetic studies (9Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Nakabeppu Y. Miyata T. Kondo H. Iwanaga S. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) may be that at alkA, Ada and meAda function to enhance RNA polymerase holoenzyme binding by stimulating α binding, whereas at the ada and aidB promoters, onlymeAda functions as an activator, and α binding is unaffected by meAda; it has been proposed that atada and aidB, meAda is required for binding of RNA polymerase to the core promoter elements at −10 and −35 (12Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the DNA binding function of the α subunit is required for binding of RNA polymerase to the alkA promoter, this requirement does not exclude the possibility that transcription is activated by Ada through a Class I transcriptional activator mechanism, as proposed (1Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the alkA promoter, methylated Ada binding is required for α binding, a role consistent with the general model proposed for Class I transcription activators (23Busby S. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 743-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It is possible that interaction of the Ada protein with the α subunit triggers an extensive conformational change in RNA polymerase, so that the −35 and −10 elements are accessible to the ς factor, and transcription initiation can occur. However, direct interaction of Ada and meAda with other subunits such as ς cannot be ruled out; the location of the Ada binding site in the alkApromoter would favor such interaction, which might not be possible in the other Ada-dependent promoters where the Ada binding site is 6–8 base pairs upstream of the −35 sequence. We thank Richard L. Gourse for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2041027795,"Resistance to radiation leukemia virus-induced leukemia is correlated with an increase in H-2D expression on the thymocyte surface. Recently, it has been shown that elevated H-2Dd expression on the infected thymocyte is a result of elevated mRNA transcription and that the transcriptional increase is correlated with elevated levels of a DNA binding activity, H-2 binding factor 1 (H-2 BF1), which recognizes the 5′-flanking sequences (5′-TGACGCG-3′) of the H-2D d gene. This target for transcription factor binding has been found to be identical in the 5′-regulatory region of 12 rodent class I genes, nine of which have been shown to be functional genes. Furthermore, thiscis-element is found 5′ of 20 primate class I genes (15 human genes), seven of which are known to be functional. Here, we demonstrate that activation transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) is one component of H-2 BF1. In addition, the levels of ATF-1mRNA in uninfected and radiation leukemia virus-infected thymocytes parallel those of H-2D d mRNA, and therefore, it is suggested that ATF-1 up-regulates the transcription of theH-2D d gene after radiation leukemia virus infection of thymocytes. Transfection experiments also demonstrate that ATF-1 activates a reporter plasmid that contains the H-2 BF1 motif, but not a reporter lacking this motif. This is the first demonstration of the interaction of ATF-1 with 5′-regulatory sequences of major histocompatibility complex class I genes. Resistance to radiation leukemia virus-induced leukemia is correlated with an increase in H-2D expression on the thymocyte surface. Recently, it has been shown that elevated H-2Dd expression on the infected thymocyte is a result of elevated mRNA transcription and that the transcriptional increase is correlated with elevated levels of a DNA binding activity, H-2 binding factor 1 (H-2 BF1), which recognizes the 5′-flanking sequences (5′-TGACGCG-3′) of the H-2D d gene. This target for transcription factor binding has been found to be identical in the 5′-regulatory region of 12 rodent class I genes, nine of which have been shown to be functional genes. Furthermore, thiscis-element is found 5′ of 20 primate class I genes (15 human genes), seven of which are known to be functional. Here, we demonstrate that activation transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) is one component of H-2 BF1. In addition, the levels of ATF-1mRNA in uninfected and radiation leukemia virus-infected thymocytes parallel those of H-2D d mRNA, and therefore, it is suggested that ATF-1 up-regulates the transcription of theH-2D d gene after radiation leukemia virus infection of thymocytes. Transfection experiments also demonstrate that ATF-1 activates a reporter plasmid that contains the H-2 BF1 motif, but not a reporter lacking this motif. This is the first demonstration of the interaction of ATF-1 with 5′-regulatory sequences of major histocompatibility complex class I genes.

Figueroa F. Nagy Z.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1983; 1: 119-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Hood L. Steinmetz M. Malissen B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1983; 1: 529-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Murine H-2 class I gene expression has been shown to be significantly altered in thymic cells after both radiation leukemia virus (RadLV) infection and RadLV-induced transformation (3Meruelo D. Nimelstein S.H. Jones P.P. Lieberman M. McDevitt H.O. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 147: 470-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Early studies using H-2 congenic mouse strains demonstrated that the H-2D d locus of the MHC is sufficient to result in resistance to RadLV-induced thymoma development (4Meruelo D. Lieberman M. Ginzten N. Deak B. McDevitt H.O. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 146: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Following infection of resistant mouse strains, there is a rapid increase in the level of Dd antigen on the surface of infected thymocytes. The immune system of resistant strains recognizes the infected cells, and a cell-mediated immune response is detectable in vitro; no such immune response is seen in susceptible hosts (5Meruelo D. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 898-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Soon thereafter, the virus-infected cells are eliminated from the resistant mice, and tumors arise in only a very small percentage of these animals (5Meruelo D. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 898-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the susceptible mouse strains (mice carrying theH-2D gene of a haplotype other than D d), the levels of H-2 expression are variable, no cell-mediated immune response is generated, and a high percentage of infected mice go on to develop thymomas. These observations clearly indicate the importance of immunosurveillance in determining the phenotypic response (resistanceversus susceptible) following RadLV infection and potential tumorigenesis.More recently, we have examined the stimulation of H-2Ddexpression at the molecular level. It was shown that infection by RadLV results in the increased transcription of H-2 gene(s) and a concomitant increase in H-2Dd antigen on the surface of the thymocytes (6Brown G.D. Nobunaga T. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. Res. Immunol. 1991; 142: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Also detectable in nuclear extracts prepared from infected thymocytes is an increased DNA binding activity that specifically recognizes the sequence 5′-TGACGCG-3′ in the 5′-flanking region of the H-2D d gene. Thistrans-acting factor has been termed H-2 binding factor 1 (H-2 BF1). The importance of this CRE-like cis-factor in class I regulation was first noted by Israel et al. (7Israel A. Le Bail O. Hatat D. Piette J. Kieran M. Logeat F. Wallach D. Fellous M. Kourilsky P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) in 1989 and subsequently by Dey et al. (8Dey A.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar) in 1992. Although, in these studies, the biological function of this cis-element in class I regulation was suggested, the trans-factor(s) that bound to this element were not identified. We have previously shown that proteins of 27 and 65 kDa bind to thiscis-sequence as determined by UV photocross-linking studies (10Nobunaga T. Brown G.D. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar).After an exhaustive search of GenBank™ sequences, we have shown that this target binding sequence is present in the 5′-regulatory region of many class I genes. Notable among the findings is that thiscis-element is identical in 17 out of 22 class I genes that have been shown to be functional, i.e. not pseudogenes, by transfection analysis. The extraordinary conservation of this sequence across evolutionary lines emphasizes its potential importance in the regulation of expression of the major histocompatibility antigens.In the experiments described here, we have screened a plasmid cDNA expression library using the yeast one-hybrid system (11Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Numerous cDNA clones have been isolated, and one group of these cDNA clones is shown to encode activation transcription factor 1 (ATF-1). Using gel supershift assays, ATF-1 is demonstrated to be one component of the in vivo H-2 BF1 complex. Several facts support this evidence. Both human and mouse ATF-1 are known to bind to the CRE binding motif (12Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 13Lee M.-R. Chung C.-S. Liou M.-L. Wu M. Li W.-F. Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1906-1912PubMed Google Scholar), which is similar to the H-2 BF1 binding sequence. Murine ATF-1 has a molecular mass of 29 kDa, comparable to the 27-kDa protein observed in UV cross-linking studies of H-2 BF1 (10Nobunaga T. Brown G.D. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar). The expression level of mRNA encoding ATF-1 closely parallels that of H-2 mRNA in both RadLV-infected and normal thymuses. Transfection experiments also demonstrate that ATF-1 activates a reporter plasmid that contains the H-2 BF1 motif. These observations suggest that ATF-1 is involved both in the normal regulation of H-2 expression and in the stimulation of transcription from the H-2D d gene after RadLV infection of mouse thymocytes.DISCUSSIONEarly experiments in the RadLV system indicated the importance of immunosurveillance in controlling tumorigenesis and the impact that altered MHC expression has on the effectiveness of the immune response of the host to virus-infected cells. Subsequently, investigations in several other systems including RNA (AKR murine leukemia virus, Moloney leukemia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus) and DNA (herpes simplex virus, SV40, adenovirus, and polyoma virus) tumor viruses also demonstrated alterations in class I gene expression resulting from viral infections and/or virus-mediated transformations (for review, see Ref. 53Brown G.D. Pampeno C. Meruelo D. Srivastava R. Ram B.P. Tyle P. Immunogenetics of the MH Complex. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1991: 268-308Google Scholar). In general, elevation of class I gene expression has been correlated with disease resistance. The picture that emerges from all of these systems is that viral infection often leads to enhanced transcription and MHC expression, while viral transformation leads to decreased expression. The net result of these changes is highly significant for the ability of the immune system to either eliminate or fail to respond to virus-infected/transformed cells. It has been established that viral antigens are presented to immune effector cells in the context of histocompatibility antigens. Studies in the systems mentioned above have led to the recognition that the quantitative expression of MHC molecules is as important to the effectiveness of the immune system as is the nature of the MHC molecule involved.

Thecis-regulatory element was located through DNA footprinting analysis; the protein complex that recognized and interacted with this sequence was termed H-2 BF1 and was shown to be composed of at least two proteins, one of which had a molecular mass of ∼27 kDa (6Brown G.D.

The molecular mass of ATF-1 approximates that of one component of H-2 BF1 as estimated from previous UV photocross-linking studies (10Nobunaga T. Brown G.D. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar). Originally, ATF-1 was cloned by screening cDNA libraries with double-stranded DNA probes containing the CRE (12Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 13Lee M.-R. Chung C.-S. Liou M.-L. Wu M. Li W.-F. Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1906-1912PubMed Google Scholar). The CRE binding motif is known to be essential for the basal transcriptional activity of many promoters (55Andrisani O.M. Pot D.A. Zhu Z.

Cogswell J.P. Miller L.R. Godlevski M.M. Stinnett S.W. Noel S.L. Kadwell S.H. Kost T.A. Gray J.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4535-4543PubMed Google Scholar, 58Feuerstein N. Huang D. Hinrichs S.H.

Immunogenetics. 1985; 21: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our data show that ATF-1 can bind both to the CRE binding motif and to the similar H-2 BF1 motif. The observation that anti-ATF-1 antibody changes the mobility of the H-2 BF1·DNA complex in gel mobility assays is strongly supportive of the conclusion that ATF-1 is one component of the H-2 BF1 complex. Northern analysis data show that the levels of H-2 mRNA in various preparations of RadLV-infected thymocyte RNA very nearly parallel those of ATF-1 mRNA. Transfection experiments also demonstrate that ATF-1 activates the reporter plasmid that contains the H-2 BF1 motif, but not the plasmid without the H-2 BF1 motif. Thus, it is also suggested that ATF-1 up-regulates the transcription of theH-2D d gene after RadLV infection of thymocytes. This is the first evidence implicating ATF-1 in the transcriptional regulation of class I MHC genes.Previously, we demonstrated that the H-2 BF1 complex was composed of at least two proteins with approximate molecular masses of 27 and 65 kDa (6Brown G.D. Nobunaga T. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. Res. Immunol. 1991; 142: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 10Nobunaga T. Brown G.D. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar). During the screening process for clones recognizing the H-2 BF1 binding motif, many clones were isolated that did not show homology to ATF-1. Sequence data show that these isolates are the p65 subunit of NF-κB and that, in fact, the in vitro translated protein product of these clones does associate with ATF-1 in vitro.2 It has been shown that NF-κB does, under some circumstances, associate with other transcription factors such as c-Jun and c-Fos (61Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), the Epstein-Barr virus bZIP transactivator (BZLF1) (62Gutsch D.E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members (63Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although preliminary attempts to demonstrate the association between ATF-1 and NF-κB p65 in vivo have not been successful, the possibility that, under certain circumstances, ATF-1 could associate with NF-κB in vivo is under investigation. While conducting UV photocross-linking analysis, it was noted that detection of the 27-kDa protein was very strong and consistent; detection of the 65-kDa protein required higher amounts of nuclear extracts and was more variable from extract to extract. In some nuclear preparations, a protein of ∼35 kDa was also detected in addition to the 27-kDa protein (data not shown). As mentioned above, we have found that the H-2 BF1 complex is composed of at least three forms: the ATF-1 homodimer, CREB homodimer, and ATF-1/CREB heterodimer.2 Murine CREB has a molecular mass of 37 kDa (64Ruppert S. Cole T.J. Boshart M. Schmid E. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and therefore, the 35-kDa protein detected in UV photocross-linking analysis is most probably CREB.

The observation that anti-ATF-1 antibody changes the mobility of the H-2 BF1·DNA complex in gel mobility assays is strongly supportive of the conclusion that ATF-1 is one component of the H-2 BF1 complex. Northern analysis data show that the levels of H-2 mRNA in various preparations of RadLV-infected thymocyte RNA very nearly parallel those of ATF-1 mRNA. Transfection experiments also demonstrate that ATF-1 activates the reporter plasmid that contains the H-2 BF1 motif, but not the plasmid without the H-2 BF1 motif. Thus, it is also suggested that ATF-1 up-regulates the transcription of theH-2D d gene after RadLV infection of thymocytes. This is the first evidence implicating ATF-1 in the transcriptional regulation of class I MHC genes.Previously, we demonstrated that the H-2 BF1 complex was composed of at least two proteins with approximate molecular masses of 27 and 65 kDa (6Brown G.D. Nobunaga T. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. Res. Immunol. 1991; 142: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 10Nobunaga T. Brown G.D. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar). During the screening process for clones recognizing the H-2 BF1 binding motif, many clones were isolated that did not show homology to ATF-1. Sequence data show that these isolates are the p65 subunit of NF-κB and that, in fact, the in vitro translated protein product of these clones does associate with ATF-1 in vitro.2 It has been shown that NF-κB does, under some circumstances, associate with other transcription factors such as c-Jun and c-Fos (61Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), the Epstein-Barr virus bZIP transactivator (BZLF1) (62Gutsch D.E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members (63Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although preliminary attempts to demonstrate the association between ATF-1 and NF-κB p65 in vivo have not been successful, the possibility that, under certain circumstances, ATF-1 could associate with NF-κB in vivo is under investigation. While conducting UV photocross-linking analysis, it was noted that detection of the 27-kDa protein was very strong and consistent; detection of the 65-kDa protein required higher amounts of nuclear extracts and was more variable from extract to extract. In some nuclear preparations, a protein of ∼35 kDa was also detected in addition to the 27-kDa protein (data not shown). As mentioned above, we have found that the H-2 BF1 complex is composed of at least three forms: the ATF-1 homodimer, CREB homodimer, and ATF-1/CREB heterodimer.2 Murine CREB has a molecular mass of 37 kDa (64Ruppert S. Cole T.J. Boshart M. Schmid E. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and therefore, the 35-kDa protein detected in UV photocross-linking analysis is most probably CREB. Early experiments in the RadLV system indicated the importance of immunosurveillance in controlling tumorigenesis and the impact that altered MHC expression has on the effectiveness of the immune response of the host to virus-infected cells. Subsequently, investigations in several other systems including RNA (AKR murine leukemia virus, Moloney leukemia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus) and DNA (herpes simplex virus, SV40, adenovirus, and polyoma virus) tumor viruses also demonstrated alterations in class I gene expression resulting from viral infections and/or virus-mediated transformations (for review, see Ref. 53Brown G.D. Pampeno C. Meruelo D. Srivastava R. Ram B.P. Tyle P. Immunogenetics of the MH Complex. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1991: 268-308Google Scholar). In general, elevation of class I gene expression has been correlated with disease resistance. The picture that emerges from all of these systems is that viral infection often leads to enhanced transcription and MHC expression, while viral transformation leads to decreased expression. The net result of these changes is highly significant for the ability of the immune system to either eliminate or fail to respond to virus-infected/transformed cells. It has been established that viral antigens are presented to immune effector cells in the context of histocompatibility antigens. Studies in the systems mentioned above have led to the recognition that the quantitative expression of MHC molecules is as important to the effectiveness of the immune system as is the nature of the MHC molecule involved. One key goal is to define the mechanisms by which viruses alter expression of MHC genes. Our laboratory first demonstrated that in RadLV-infected cells, increased cell-surface expression of H-2Dd antigen is a result of elevated levels of transcription (10Nobunaga T. Brown G.D. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar). Thecis-regulatory element was located through DNA footprinting analysis; the protein complex that recognized and interacted with this sequence was termed H-2 BF1 and was shown to be composed of at least two proteins, one of which had a molecular mass of ∼27 kDa (6Brown G.D. Nobunaga T. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. Res. Immunol. 1991; 142: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 10Nobunaga T. Brown G.D. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar). The cis-element is of interest in that it has been found to be perfectly conserved in the 5′-region of nine out of nine known functional genes encoding murine transplantation antigens. Likewise, the sequence is identical in the majority of primate MHC genes that have been shown to be functional. In the experiments described here, we have used the yeast one-hybrid system to identify murine ATF-1 as being one component of H-2 BF1. H-2 BF1 is the thymus-specific transcriptional activator complex (54Brown G.D. Ishiguro N. Meruelo D. Allerg. Immunol. ( Paris ). 1994; 13: 59-67Google Scholar) that recognizes sequences (5′-TGACGCG-3′) 5′ of the H-2D d gene. The molecular mass of ATF-1 approximates that of one component of H-2 BF1 as estimated from previous UV photocross-linking studies (10Nobunaga T. Brown G.D. Morris D.R. Meruelo D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar). Originally, ATF-1 was cloned by screening cDNA libraries with double-stranded DNA probes containing the CRE (12Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 13Lee M.-R. Chung C.-S. Liou M.-L. Wu M. Li W.-F. Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1906-1912PubMed Google Scholar). The CRE binding motif is known to be essential for the basal transcriptional activity of many promoters (55Andrisani O.M. Pot D.A. Zhu Z. Dixon J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1947-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 56Quinn P.G. Wong W.T. Magnuson M.A. Shabb J.B. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and ATF-1 has been shown to be involved in the expression of numerous genes, including calcitonin, Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit, and interleukin-1β (57Chandra G. Cogswell J.P. Miller L.R. Godlevski M.M. Stinnett S.W. Noel S.L. Kadwell S.H. Kost T.A. Gray J.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4535-4543PubMed Google Scholar, 58Feuerstein N. Huang D. Hinrichs S.H.
