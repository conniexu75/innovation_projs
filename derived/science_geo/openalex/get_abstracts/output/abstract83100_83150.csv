https://openalex.org/W1491833339,"We elucidated the mechanism by which gelsolin, a Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein from lung macrophages, controls the network structure of actin filaments. In the presence of micromolar Ca2+, gelsolin bound Ca2+. The Ca2+-gelsolin complex reduced the apparent viscosity and flow birefringence of F-actin and the lengths of actin filaments viewed in the electron microscope. However, concentrations of gelsolin causing these alterations did not effect proportionate changes in the turbidity of actin filament solutions or in the quantity of nonsedimentable actin as determined by a radioassay. From these findings, we conclude that gelsolin shortens actin filaments without net depolymerization. Such an effect on the distribution of actin filament lengths led to the prediction that low concentrations of gelsolin would increase the critical concentration of actin-binding protein required for incipient gelation of actin filaments in the presence of Ca2+, providing an efficient mechanism for controlling actin network structure. We verified the prediction experimentally, and we estimated that the Ca2+-gelsolin complex effectively breaks the bond between actin monomers in filaments with a stoichiometry of 1:1. The effect of Ca2+-gelsolin complex on actin solation was rapid, independent of temperature between 0 degrees and 37 degrees C, and reversed by reducing the free Ca2+ concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1521536151,"Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase has been purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli. For this purification, a strain of E. coli which was derepressed for AdoMet synthetase and which harbors a plasmid containing the structural gene for AdoMet synthetase was constructed. This strain produces 80-fold more AdoMet synthetase than a wild type E. coli. AdoMet synthetase has a molecular weight of 180,000 and is composed of four identical subunits. In addition to the synthetase reaction, the purified enzyme catalyzes a tripolyphosphatase reaction that is stimulated by AdoMet. Both enzymatic activities require a divalent metal ion and are markedly stimulated by certain monovalent cations. AdoMet synthesis also takes place if adenyl-5'yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) is substituted for ATP. The imidotriphosphate (PPNP) formed is not hydrolyzed, permitting dissociation of AdoMet formation from tripolyphosphate cleavage. An enzyme complex is formed which contains one equivalent (per subunit) of adenosylmethionine, monovalent cation, imidotriphosphate, and presumably divalent cation(s). The rate of product dissociation from this complex is 3 orders of magnitude slower than the rate of AdoMet formation from ATP. Studies with the phosphorothioate derivatives of ATP (ATP alpha S and ATP beta S) in the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ indicate that a divalent ion is bound to the nucleotide during the reaction and provide information on the stereochemistry of the metal-nucleotide binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1522015108,"We describe the purification procedure and some of the physiochemical properties of gelsolin, a major Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein of actin gel-sol transformation in rabbit lung macrophages. Gelsolin accounts for the majority of Ca2+ control of actin gelation in macrophage extracts. It is a single polypeptide chain with an average molecular weight of 91,000 a Stokes radius of 44 A, a sedimentation coefficient (s20(0),w) of 4.9 S, an isoelectric point of 6.1, and a frictional ratio of 1.43. Gelsolin binds 2 mol of Ca2+ with high affinity (Ka 1.09 X 10(6) M-1) in the presence of 0.1 M KCl and 2 mM MgCl2."

https://openalex.org/W2159683467,"We recently reported that the high mannose-type oligosaccharides of the biosynthetic intermediates of beta-glucuronidase contain phosphate groups in diester linkage between mannose residues and outer alpha-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues (Tabas, I., and Kornfeld, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6633-6639). We now describe an alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase from rat liver that is capable of removing the N-acetyl-glucosamine residues, leaving phosphomonoester groups on the high mannose oligosaccharide units. This activity is greatly enriched in smooth membrane preparations. It can be distinguished from a lysosomal alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase by several criteria, including subcellular localization and differential inhibition by amino sugars. In addition, human fibroblasts with mutations which lead to a deficiency of the lysosomal activity have normal levels of the alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase. This enzyme may be involved in the unmasking of the phosphomannosyl recognition marker on newly synthesized acid hydrolases which could then direct the targeting of these enzymes to lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1668883441,"The organization and sequence of the rat preprolactin gene has been investigated. Analysis of two different plasmids containing pituitary cDNA inserts has provided the complete 681-nucleotide coding sequence of preprolactin as well as 17 nucleotides preceding the initiation codon and 90 nucleotides following the termination codon. Digestion of rat chromosomal DNA with the restriction endonuclease Eco RI followed by size fractionation and hybridization to a labeled prolactin cDNA probe has demonstrated that prolactin genomic sequences are located on 6.0-, 3.9-, and 2.9-kilobase fragments. The 6.0- and 3.9-kilobase fragments were isolated from a library of cloned rat DNA fragments. The sequence of more than 1800 nucleotides of the cloned DNA has been determined. The sequenced region contains coding regions of 180 and 189 nucleotides which specify the COOH-terminal 123 amino acids of the 227-amino-acid sequence of rat preprolactin. These coding regions are separated by an intervening sequence of 597 nucleotides. At least one other large intervening sequence separates this region from the region coding for the NH2-terminal portion of preprolactin. Hybridization experiments suggested that the intervening sequences of the rat prolactin gene contain DNA sequences which are repeated elsewhere in the rat genome."

https://openalex.org/W1580433758,"Abstract The regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II (RII) from porcine heart was modified specifically and covalently using the photoaffinity reagent, 8-azidoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-N3cAMP). In the presence of excess cAMP, the photo-dependent incorporation of 8-N3cAMP was abolished whereas excess AMP and ATP had no effect. A maximum incorporation of 0.5 mol of 8-N3cAMP was achieved/mol of regulatory subunit monomer (Mr = 55,000). This level of incorporation was obtained when the purified regulatory subunit was treated with urea prior to labeling to remove residual bound cAMP. When the regulatory subunit was labeled with radioactive 8-N3cAMP, cleaved with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides mapped in two dimensions, a single major radioactive peptide was observed. Chemical cleavage of the radioactively labeled RII with cyanogen bromide and subsequent chromatography on Sephadex G-50 also yielded a single major peak of radioactivity. The covalently modified cyanogen bromide peptide subsequently was purified to homogeneity using high performance liquid chromatography. Greater than 90% of the radioactivity that was incorporated into the regulatory subunit was recovered in this cyanogen bromide peptide which had the following sequence: Lys-Arg-Asn-Ile-Ser-His-Tyr (cAMP)-Glu-Glu-Cln-Leu-Val-Lys-Hse. When the Edman degradation of this peptide was carried out, the radioactivity derived from the 8-N3cAMP was released with the tyrosine residue at Step 7 identifying this residue as the specific site of attachment of the photoaffinity reagent."
https://openalex.org/W1520451556,"Nerve growth factor binds to cell surface membrane receptors on sensory and sympathetic neurons. The binding of radiolabeled beta nerve growth factor to sympathetic neurons is characterized by two specific binding sites with similar dissociation constants to those seen for sensory neurons. The high affinity site, type I, has an apparent dissociation constant of 1.1 X 10(-11) M. The lower affinity site, type II, has an apparent dissociation constnat of 5.0 X 10(-10) M. When radiolabeled beta nerve growth factor is incubated with sympathetic nerve cells for various lengths of time, as much as 50% of the specifically bound labeled nerve growth factor is sequestered. Sequestration is time- and energy-dependent, and appears to o ccur mainly through type I sites. These data suggest a step which is subsequent to the binding of nerve growth factor to its responsive cells and may be the first step in the process that allows nerve growth factor to be internalized."

https://openalex.org/W1500576524,"Glucagon produces a time- and dose-dependent activation of phospholipid methyltransferase activity in isolated rat hepatocytes. Half-maximal effect is caused by a dose of glucagon of 1 x 10(-10) M. This activation is due to an increase of the Vmax value of the enzyme, without affecting the Km value for S-adenosylmethionine. Exogenous cyclic AMP added to isolated rat hepatocytes mimics the effect of glucagon, and the activation of phospholipid methyltransferase by a nonsaturating concentration of glucagon is spontaneously reversible within 40 min of incubation."
https://openalex.org/W1592224950,"Abstract Calf thymus ribonuclease H I (for nomenclature, see Busen, W., and Hausen, P. (1975) Eur. J. Biochem. 52, 179-190) has been purified to near homogeneity. The large scale purification procedure results in a 1,000-fold enrichment of enzyme protein over the crude extract. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 80,000, and S value of about 5, and an isoelectric point of about 4.9 under nondenaturing conditions. The purified enzyme sample contains two forms of ribonuclease H I, possibly isozymes, named ribonuclease H I 1 and ribonuclease H I 2. They can be activated by Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions. The most highly purified fraction is composed of four polypeptides named A, B, C, and D with molecular weights of 31,6000, 26,6000, 24,800, and 24,300, respectively. Polypeptides A, C, and D are acidic, whereas Polypeptide B is basic. Each form consists of three polypeptides. Ribonuclease H I 1 and ribonuclease H I 2 have Polypeptides A and B in common and differ from each other in the third. The data are consistent with a trimeric (A, B, C/D) or tetrameric (A, B2, C/D) structure for calf thymus ribonuclease H I. When alkalisensitive supercoiled DNA molecules containing ribonucleotides covalently inserted in one of the DNA strands are used as substrate, the products of the reaction are relaxed circles; thus, ribonuclease H I has an endonucleolytic mode of action. The final preparation is free of ribonuclease, and also of endodeoxyribonuclease activity single- and double-stranded DNA. Rabbit antiserum raised against the most highly purified calf thymus ribonuclease H I specifically precipitates the Polypeptides A, B, C, and D and inhibits the Mn2+ - and Mg2+ -dependent enzyme activities to more than 90%. Whereas a typical monophasic neutralization curve is obtained with Mn2+ activation, the neutralization curve observed with Mg2+ is biphasic. These results and several other differences between the Mn2+ - and the Mg2+ -dependent activities of the ribonucleases H I seem best explained by a hypothesis in which the enzymes exist in two different conformations depending on the type of divalent cation activation. The antiserum neutralizes ribonuclease H I but not the other known calf thymus ribonuclease H activities (IIa; IIb), demonstrating that the different ribonuclease H activities in calf thymus are serologically distinct. Ribonuclease H I is localized in the cell nucleus as visualized by immunofluorescent staining of bovine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1531590060,"Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase was found predominantly (85%) in RNA-rich microsomes, the rest being in RNA-poor and smooth microsomes. However, the esterified cholesterol concentration of smooth microsomes was 2-fold greater than that of RNA-rich microsomes, suggesting the possibility of an interaction between RNA-rich and smooth microsomes. The distribution of cholesteryl ester between microsome subfractions was examined after incubation of a mixture of RNA-rich and smooth microsomes with [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA. Based upon specific acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activities of the individual fractions, only 31 +/- 3% of the total cholesteryl ester radioactivity should have been found in the smooth component. However, the smooth microsomes contained 54 +/- 3% (p < 0.01) of the radioactive cholesteryl esters. The entrapment of radioactive cholesteryl ester in the smooth microsomes could not be accounted for by passive transfer of cholesteryl ester from RNA-rich microsomes to smooth microsomes. It is proposed that cholesterol in the smooth microsomal membranes may have been esterified by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltrasferase located on the surface of RNA-rich microsomes with the resulting cholesteryl ester retained in the smooth microsomes. This hypothesis was strengthened by the observation that acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl-transferase was located on the cytoplasmic surface of the RNA-rich microsomal vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W55296692,"The origin of the envelope lipids acquired by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) during budding from the plasma membrane of chicken embryo fibroblasts was examined. Several differences were observed between the lipid composition of RSV and the plasma membrane. When the phospholipid composition of the cells was modified by growing them in the presence of the choline analogues, N,N-dimethylethanolamine or l-2-amino-1-butanol, the phospholipid composition of the virus was subsequently altered but in a very different manner than the plasma membrane. In the plasma membrane, the increase in the analogue-containing phospholipid was at the expense of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine while the amount of sphingomyelin remained constant. In RSV, however, there was a decrease in sphingomyelin and phosphatidylethanolamine while there was only a small change in the amount of phosphatidylcholine. Phospholipid polar head group modification did not significantly alter the fatty acid composition or the cholesterol content. Membranes of phagosomes isolated after the cells had ingested latex beads had essentially the same phospholipid composition as the plasma membrane. The phospholipid composition of VSV was different from RSV, but it also did not reflect the composition of the plasma membrane. The composition of the plasma membrane was intermediate between the viruses and the endoplasmic reticulum, but contamination of the plasma membrane fraction with the endoplasmic reticulum could not account for the observed differences. These results show that the viruses bud from localized lipid regions that do not reflect the average properties of the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1553034254,"Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase holoenzyme transcribes phi 29 DNA in vitro producing five major RNA species defined by characteristic electrophoretic mobilities. In addition to these products, Escherichia coli RNA polymerase transcribes phi 29 DNA to yield three RNA species not detected when transcribing with the B. subtilis enzyme under the same optimal reaction conditions for RNA synthesis. Transcriptional analysis of purified restriction fragments and exonuclease III-digested DNA established locations of six promoter and three termination sites defining the eight transcripts. The transcription map shows that E. coli RNA polymerase initiates transcription at three sites not efficiently utilized by the B. subtilis enzyme. However, initiation by the B. subtilis polymerase from at least two of these sites could be detected at E:DNA ratios greater than 10 in the absence of competing promoters. These results indicate that differences between the two polymerases in promoter utilization are not explained by specificity of promoter binding, but represent differences in responding to promoter strength. Transcription of phi 29 DNA and T7 DNA by E. coli core polymerase with either B. subtilis or E. coli sigma subunits results in formation of transcripts identical with those produced by E. coli holoenzyme, suggesting that core polymerase contains elements important in determining relative promoter strength. The efficiency of rifampicin-resistant complex formation on phi 29 and T7 promoters is also dependent upon the source of core polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W1551435639,"We have shown previously that proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified Na+K+-ATPase from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, transport Na+ with low efficiency (Spector, M., O'Neal, S. and Racker, E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem., 255, 5504-5507). We now present evidence that this low efficiency (expressed in the ratio of Na+-transported/ATP-hydrolyzed) is caused by the phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the Na+K+-ATPase by an endogenous protein kinase. On addition of [gamma-32P]ATP, crude tumor plasma membrane preparations phosphorylated the beta subunit of the ATPase, whereas crude mouse brain plasma membranes did not. However, solubilized Na+K+-ATPase from either tumor or brain wre phosphorylated by purified protein kinase from the tumor plasma membrane and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase. In both cases, the phosphorylated enzyme was inefficient; the dephosphorylated enzyme was efficient after reconstitution into liposomes. During isolation of the Na+K+-ATPase from Ehrlich ascites tumor or mouse brain, an endogenous protease partially cleaved from the beta subunit a polypeptide of 29,000 daltons that contained the phosphorylation site. The proteolytic cleavage of the beta subunit was partially inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the major site of phosphorylation was then seen in the 53,000-dalton beta subunit of the enzyme. The isolated 29,000-dalton polypeptide from mouse brain ATPase was phosphorylated by tumor protein kinase with a stoichiometry of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. When this 29,000-dalton polypeptide from mouse brain was incorporated into the tumor Na+K+-ATPase after mild proteolytic digestion, a marked increase in efficiency was observed after reconstitution of the Na+ pump."

https://openalex.org/W1592102028,"Two cytoplasmic petite (rho-) clones of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been selected for the retention of the aspartic acid tRNA gene. The two clones, designated DS200/A102 and DS200/A5, have tandemly repeated segments of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with unit lengths of 1,000 and 6,400 base pairs, respectively. The DS200/A102 genome has a single tRNA gene with a 3'-CUG-5' anticodon capable of recognizing the 5'-GAC-3' and 5'-GAU-3' codons for aspartic acid. The mtDNA segment of DS200/A102 has been determined to represent the wild type sequence from 5.3 to 6.8 map units. The genome of DS200/A5 is more complex encompassing the region of wild type mtDNA from 3.5 to 12.7 units. A continuous sequence has been obtained from 3.5 to 8.6 units. In addition to the aspartic acid tRNA, this region codes for the tRNAUGCAla,tRNAUCUArg, tRNAACGArg, tRNAGCUSer,tRNAUCCGly and tRNAUUULys. The DNA sequence of the DS200/A5 genome has allowed us to deduce the secondary structures of the seven tRNAs and to assign precise map positions for their genes. All the tRNAs except tRNA GUCAsp exhibit most of the invariant features of prokaryotic and eukaryotic tRNAs. The aspartic acid tRNA has unusual D and T psi C loops. The structure of this tRNA is similar to the mitochondrial initiator tRNA of Neurospora crassa (Heckman, J.E., Hecker, L.I., Shwartzbach, S.D., Barnett, W.E., Baumstark, B., and RajBhandary, U.L. Cell 13, 83-95)."
https://openalex.org/W1563917903,"The regulatory subunit of the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RI) can be separated into multiple forms on isoelectric focusing gels. RI from bovine skeletal muscle gives rise to bands at pI = 5.57 and 5.45. Phosphate determinations indicate that the more acidic band contains protein-bound phosphate. RI from rat skeletal muscle can be separated into three bands of pI = 5.57, 5.45, and 5.35. The two acidic forms comigrate with labeled RI isolated from rat soleus muscles that were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate. RI from bovine muscle is isolated mainly in the unphosphorylated state while that from rat muscle is primarily phosphorylated. At lest 4 mol of phosphate can be incorporated into each RI dimer following extensive phosphorylation by cGMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro. Two phosphopeptides are observed on polyacrylamide gels following partial proteolysis of in vitro phosphorylated rat RI. One of these peptides is also observed following proteolysis of rat RI phosphorylated in intact soleus muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1498392274,"The effects of vitamin K3, quinones, fat-soluble vitamins, and various naturally occurring and synthetic compounds on the binding of 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) to mink lung cells or murine 3T3 cells in culture were studied. Vitamin K3, but not other fat-soluble vitamins, markeldy inhibits the binding of 125I-labeled EGF to treated cells, but does not affect the binding of insulin, concanavalin A, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and murine leukemia virus glycoprotein, gp70, to their membrane receptors. The binding of multiplication stimulating activity to treated cells is also reduced to some extent. Vitamin K3 alters the affinity of the receptors for EGF without changing the total number of available receptors per cell. Vitamin K3 modulation of EGF-receptor interaction is a temperature- and time-dependent phenomenon. EGF-receptor interaction is also significantly modulated by 1,4-naphthoquinone, 1,4-benzoquinone, and phenanthrenequinone but not by other quinones of anthracyclic antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W1583883144,The radioisotopic method used to assay acetylglutamate kinase (EC 2.7.2.8) of Neurospora crassa has been shown to detect two distinct enzymatically catalyzed reactions. The enzymes were separated by differential centrifugation into a cytosolic activity and an organellar activity. Both activities required ATP and were thermal-labile. The cytosolic activity was insensitive to inhibition by arginine and formed a stable reaction product in the absence of hydroxylamine. The organellar activity had an absolute requirement for hydroxylamine in order to form a stable reaction product. The product of the cytosolic activity was separated from acetylglutamate hydroxamate (the product of the organellar activity) and was identified as the cyclic amide pyroglutamate by cation exchange chromatography. The organellar activity has been implicated in arginine biosynthesis by the following criteria: it was completely and specifically inhibited by arginine concentrations as low as 200 microM; its level was elevated 2-fold in a mutant strain with derepressed levels of arginine biosynthetic enzymes; and it was absent in an arginine auxotrophic strain (the cytosolic activity was present). The organellar activity co-sedimented with mitochondria during isopycnic gradient centrifugation. The metabolic problems posed by a mitochondrial location of a feedback-sensitive enzyme and the cytosolic location of its effector are discussed.

In the presence of exogenous yeast RNA polymerase III, this purified chromatin actively synthesizes a set of 5 S ribosomal RNAs all of which have 5'-sequences identical with mature 5 S RNA but which end with a variable number (up to 10) of additional residues at the 3'-terminus.

https://openalex.org/W1565475717,"D-Tagatose-6-phosphate kinase, an inducible enzyme that functions in the metabolism of lactose and D-galactose in Staphylococcus aureus, was purified about 300-fold from an extract of D-galactose-grown cells. The enzyme catalyzed the nucleoside triphosphate-dependent phosphorylation of both D-tagatose 6-phosphate and D-fructose 6-phosphate. Although the Vmax values were equal for these two substrates, the apparent Km values differed by 10,000-fold, being 16 micro M for D-tagatose 6-phosphate and 150 mM for D-fructose 6-phosphate. The purified enzyme was free from the constitutive D-fructose-6-phosphate kinase. Phosphoryl donors used by D-tagatose-6-phosphate kinse, listed in order of decreasing rates at saturating concentrations were GTP, UTP ITP ATP, CTP, and TTP; the Km values were 0.38, 0.91, 0.17, 0.16, 18, and 20 mM, respectively. The enzyme appeared to be nonallosteric; it exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics and was not inhibited by high concentrations of MgATP. However, it was activated 3- to 4-fold by 33.3 mM K+, NH4+, Rb+, and Cs+, and was inhibited 31 to 65% by 33.3 mM Na+ and Li+. It was inactivated reversibly by the thiol reagent, N-ethylmaleimide. The subunit molecular weight was estimated to be 52,000, and the native enzyme appeared to be a dimer with a sedimentation coefficient of 6.8 S. Data on stability, pH optimum, and inducibility of the enzyme are also presented."

The homogeneity of the isolated glycoproteins was demonstrated by analysis of the NH2-terminal peptides. Some purified glycoproteins were found to be hybrid molecules in terms of the type of oligosaccharides they bear. The majority of the oligosaccharides (approximately 90%) bound on thee glycoproteins are N-glycosidically linked (Mr approximately 3000 to 5000). Another 5% appears to be small groups linked O-glycosidically to several adjacent or closely spaced amino acid residues. The remainder (5%) of the carbohydrate groups appears to be small, covalently bound glycosaminoglycans. This is the first report of hybrid molecules bearing glycosaminoglycans in the cell surface. The ratio of the types of oligosaccharides varies among different glycoproteins. There is slightly more glycosaminoglycan present on glycoproteins from malignant cells. A remarkably complex but similar array of N-glyucosidically linked oligosccharides is bound to different individual membrane glycoproteins. Each individual polypeptide must contain only a small number of the total observed carbohydrate groups, i.e. the carbohydrate groups on individual polypeptides are grossly heterogeneous. This implies that purification is based largely on the characteristics of the polypeptide, and that overall charge and size of the carbohydrate groups are relatively constant in a single population of glycoproteins. Our results suggest that the differences between the carbohydrate groups derived from glycoproteins from control and transformed cells are mainly quantitative."
https://openalex.org/W1647569881,"The hydrolysis of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate by the high Km cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase of bakers' yeast was studied over a range of temperature and pH at I = 0.17. The effects of ionic strength and MgCl2 concentration were studied at pH 7.7 and 30 degrees C. Km and Vmax were insensitive to changes in the MgCl2 concentration between 1 and 30 mM, implying that this enzyme (which does not require free divalent metal ions) does not discriminate between free cyclic AMP- and the Mg-cyclic AMP+ complex. Vmax decreased below pH 6.8 because of protonation of a group required in the basic form in the enzyme x substrate complex. On the basis of its pK (5.46 at 30 degrees C) and delta H (23 kJ/mol) this group was tentatively identified as imidazole. Vmax/Km decreased above pH 6.8 because of ionization of a group required in the acid form in the free enzyme, with a pK of 7.88 at 30 degrees C and a delta H of about 13 kJ/mol. Several possibilities exist for the identity of this group, the most likely being a second imidazole, sulfhydryl, or a water molecule bonded to tightly bound zinc. At pH 7.90, log Vmax and log Km both changed linearly with 1/T (between 12 degrees C and 37 degrees C) with enthalpies of 47 and 55 kJ/mol, respectively. Consequently, at low enough cyclic AMP concentration, the rate of reaction at pH 7.90 decreases slightly when the temperature is increased. This is also true at higher pH, but in the physiological pH range (6.4 to 7.5) Vmax/Km and, therefore, the rate of reaction at very low cyclic AMP concentration were nearly independent of temperature. Under physiological conditions, the Km approaches the upper limit of in vivo cyclic AMP concentrations in yeast, and at normal in vivo cyclic AMP concentrations the pH optimum is within or below the physiological range of pH in yeast."

A hybridization band was visible with RNA prepared from wild type cells, but not with RNA prepared from an iso-1-cytochrome c deletion mutant. RNA prepared from cells containing a nonsense mutation in the iso-1-cytochrome c gene showed reduced levels of hybridization. The RNA that hybridized to the probe was 700 +/- 50 nucleotides in length and was polyadenylated. The cellular levels of this RNA were repressed by glucose, and this repression was achieved within 5 min after glucose addition to a derepressed culture. No precursors of this RNA were detected in wild type cells or in an RNA1 mutant, temperature-sensitive for RNA metabolism. The length of the 3' noncoding region of this RNA was determined to be 200 +/- 25 nucleotides (excluding the poly(A) tail) and the 5' noncoding region was estimated to be about 120 nucleotides in length."

However, no effect was observed when relaxed pBR322 DNA, which does not contain SV40 DNA sequences, was incubated with T antigen in the presence of topoisomerase.

https://openalex.org/W1523196456,"The EPR spectra of the NO complexes of frozen solutions of ascorbic acid-reduced cytochrome oxidase (nitrite reductase) purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, of its heme d1-depleted form, and of heme d1 in solutions containing various nitrogenous bases are quite similar to each other as well as to several heme (iron protoporphyrin IX)-containing proteins. The NO complexes of heme d1 (an iron-chlorin) in the presence of nitrogenous bases belong to spectral type C according to Kon's classification and, thus, the energy levels of the iron are closely related to thorse of heme complexes recorded under similar conditions. Comparison of these spectra with those of complexes of known structure suggests that both heme c and heme d1 are linked with Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase by means of a nitrogenous ligand. The EPR spectrum of the NO complex of the native enzyme exhibits a lack of resolution of the high field (gy) resonance which can be characterized in terms of a spectral contribution from both the heme c and heme d1 moieties. The similarity between the EPR spectra of the NO complexes of horse heart cytochrome c and the heme d1-depleted Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase before and after interaction with urea suggests structural similarities involving the heme irons. The changes caused by urea are likely to be a breaking or distortion of the bond between the iron and the protein-donated nitrogenous ligand and are similar to alterations seen with NO complexes of hemoglobin under a variety of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1588415054,"DNA of the specialized transducing phage lambda dapB2 has been digested with the restriction endonucleases Bam I, HindIII, or both together to generate fragments originating from the bacterial substitution on the phage. Seven such fragments ranging in size from 0.8 to 7.1 kilobases and encompassing the entire bacterial substitution of 18 kilobases of DNA have been covalently ligated to the vector pBR322. The recombinant plasmids so constructed have been tested for their ability to complement the dapB17 allele in Escherichia coli strain AT999. Only pGM4, which contains a 7.1 kilboase fragment generated by Bam I cleavage of lambdadapB2 inserted into pBR322, relieves this strain's requirement for DL-diaminopimelic acid and restores dihyrodipicolinic acid reductase activity to wild type levels. Deletions were obtained in pGM4 by two methods. None of the resultant shortened plasmids were proficient in complementation of the dapB17 allele. The proteins encoded by the parental plasmid and by those of seven deletions derived from it have been identified by coupled transcription and translation of plasmid DNA templates in vitro or by the stimulation of protein synthesis promoted by these plasmids in an ultraviolet irradiated host. The parent encodes four proteins unique to the 7.1 kilobase insert whose apparent molecular weights are 48,000, 36,000, 32,000, and 17,000. Of these, the protein of 32,000 is consistently missing when noncomplementing pasmids harboring deletions are used as templates. This protein is tentatively identified as the product of the dapB gene. The role of the other three proteins whose genes are closey linked to the dapB gene is unknown. There appear to be at least two transcriptional units within this cluster of genes, however, suggesting independent regulation and, possibly, function."
https://openalex.org/W1607650591,"A nuclease highly active on single-stranded DNA has been purified 11,200-fold from Ustilago maydis. The enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 S and a Stokes radius of 36 A. The native form of the enzyme appears to be a single polypeptide chain of 68,000 daltons. The enzyme is fully active in the presence of chelating agents but is strongly inhibited by nucleotides. Maximal activity is seen at pH 6. The enzyme hydrolyzes linear DNA in an exonucleotytic fashion from the 5' end liberating 3'-mononucleotides and small oligonucleotides. Degradation of DNA takes place through a distributive mode rather than a processive mode. The enzyme is also active on both single-stranded and duplex circular DNA, dephosphorylates 5'-nucleotides, and hydrolyzes RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1506984638,"The reactions of ferric heme-containing fragments with apofragments to form ordered complexes resembling native horse heart cytochrome c have been studied under conditions which resolve the overall process into consecutive second order and first order kinetic steps. In the initial, second order step the two fragments combine to form an intermediate complex which exhibits tryptophan 59 fluorescence quenching similar to native cytochrome c, but which has not yet achieved the native ligation state of the heme iron. The existence of first order processes following the second order step is demonstrated by absorbance changes in the Soret region. the entire absorbance change at 695 nm, relating to ligation of the sulfur atom of methionine 80 to the heme iron, is also associated with these first order processes. Thus, ligation of methionine is a late event in this self ordering of the polypeptide chains. Since the conformational energy is assumed to distinctly decrease in this late process of folding (Parr, G.R., and Taniuchi, H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2616-2623), it would follow that small spatial rearrangements of the polypeptide chains in the late stage of folding (as manifested by the ligation of methionine) are associated with a specific decrease in energy."

https://openalex.org/W1554124116,"Alterations in the NS protein of the tsE1 mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus (New Jersey serotype) appear to be responsible for its temperature-sensitive phenotype. The NS proteins of thermostable revertants of tsE1 migrated in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate with apparent sizes which were identical to tsE1 NS, or which were 5% or 14% larger than tsE1 NS. These novel differences persisted during electrophoresis in 10% and 12.5% acrylamide gels, and in gels with gradients of acrylamide, suggesting that aberrant sodium dodecyl sulfate binding was not involved. Co-infection of cells with pairs of viruses resulted in the synthesis of both types of NS protein, suggesting that no trans-acting phenomenon was involved. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that each of the NS proteins consisted of several species, but the isoelectric points of the proteins from different viruses overlapped. Furthermore, all of the NS species from a particular virus migrated with the same apparent molecular weight, suggesting that aberrant phosphorylation was not responsible for the apparent differences in size. Finally, tryptic peptide maps of amino acid and 32Pi-labeled NS proteins demonstrated that the revertant NS proteins contained all of the peptides and phosphopeptides of tsE1 NS, but each revertant NS with an apparently larger protein also contained an extra nonphosphorylated peptide. These data are consistent with the idea that the reversion of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of tsE1 can be accompanied by production of a significantly larger NS protein."
https://openalex.org/W1527956255,"We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the avian tRNATrp which serves as primer for avian retrovirus DNA synthesis by the viral polymerase. The sequence is identical to that reported for tRNATrp present in uninfected avian cells (Harada, F., Sawyer, R. C., and Dahlberg, J. E. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3487-3497). Although there appears to be only a single species of tRNATrp in avian cells, two functionally different forms within the population can be distinguished. We show that the tRNATrp isolated from virions can act in vitro as an efficient suppressor for UGA. The suppressor activity is roughly 3-fold greater with viral tRNATrp than with cellular tRNATrp. In addition, it has been reported (Panet, A., Haseltine, W. A., Baltimore, D., Peters, G., Harada, F., and Dahlberg, J. E. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 2535-2539) that the viral polymerase can bind 100% of viral tRNATrp, but only 30% of cellular tRNATrp. Hence, avian retroviruses seem to selectively incorporate and utilize only one of these forms. Since the nucleotide sequence and nucleoside modifications are identical between viral and cellular tRNATrp, two conformations of avian tRNATrp may exist which can influence several biological activities of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1582230575,"The structure of a newly and independently isolated defective variant of simian virus 40 that contains covalently linked monkey and SV40 DNA sequences is described. This variant, termed 290, has a structure essentially identical with a previously isolated and characterized variant named CVP8/1/P2 (Eco RI res). The structural similarities include the monkey (host) DNA segment that is combined with viral DNA sequences, the particular viral DNA segment that is present, and the arrangement of these within the defective genome. The monkey DNA segment contains sequences derived from both low and high reiteration frequency monkey DNA. The viral sequences include the origin of replication. The separate isolation of essentially identical variants suggests a high level of specificity in the events leading to the formation and amplification of this type of defective genome."
