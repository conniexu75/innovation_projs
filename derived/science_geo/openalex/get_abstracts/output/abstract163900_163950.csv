https://openalex.org/W1669888413,"Northern mid-latitude forests are a large terrestrial carbon sink. Ignoring nutrient limitations, large increases in carbon sequestration from carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization are expected in these forests. Yet, forests are usually relegated to sites of moderate to poor fertility, where tree growth is often limited by nutrient supply, in particular nitrogen. Here we present evidence that estimates of increases in carbon sequestration of forests, which is expected to partially compensate for increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, are unduly optimistic. In two forest experiments on maturing pines exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2, the CO2-induced biomass carbon increment without added nutrients was undetectable at a nutritionally poor site, and the stimulation at a nutritionally moderate site was transient, stabilizing at a marginal gain after three years. However, a large synergistic gain from higher CO2 and nutrients was detected with nutrients added. This gain was even larger at the poor site (threefold higher than the expected additive effect) than at the moderate site (twofold higher). Thus, fertility can restrain the response of wood carbon sequestration to increased atmospheric CO2. Assessment of future carbon sequestration should consider the limitations imposed by soil fertility, as well as interactions with nitrogen deposition."

In this report we show that resistin expression is significantly decreased in the white adipose tissue of several different models of obesity including the ob/ob, db/db, tub/tub, and KKAy mice compared with their lean counterparts. Furthermore, in response to several different classes of antidiabetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonists, adipose tissue resistin expression is increased in both ob/ob mice and Zucker diabetic fatty rats. These data demonstrate that experimental obesity in rodents is associated with severely defective resistin expression, and decreases in resistin expression are not required for the antidiabetic actions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonists.

Recently, a novel 12.5-kDa cysteine-rich protein, termed resistin, was shown to be secreted by adipocytes (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Resistin expression was markedly induced during the conversion of 3T3-L1 cells to mature adipocytes (5Steppan C.M.

Administration of resistin to wild type mice impaired glucose tolerance and insulin action, and resistin levels were reported to be increased in genetic and diet-induced forms of obesity (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). When an antibody against resistin was administered to obese mice, an increase in systemic insulin sensitivity was noted (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it was suggested that resistin serves as a hormonal link between obesity and peripheral insulin resistance in diabetes (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Resistin expression was also shown to be regulated by glitazones, a class of insulin-sensitizing drugs approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Rosiglitazone and other glitazones lower glucose and lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes by activating the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)1 (7Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Rosiglitazone treatment was shown to reduce resistin expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytesin vitro and in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice fed a high fat diet (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). These data raised the interesting possibility that decreases in resistin levels might be integral to the antidiabetic actions of PPARγ agonists. In this report, we have examined resistin expression in several different rodent models of obesity and its regulation in response to different classes of PPARγ agonists. Surprisingly, we find that resistin expression is decreased in obese mice and increased in ob/ob mice and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats in response to PPARγ agonists. All procedures performed were in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, United States Department of Agriculture regulations and approved by the GlaxoSmithKline and Harvard University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were housed at 72 °F and 50% relative humidity with a 12-h light and dark cycle and fed chow diet (Formulab Diet 5008; PMI Feeds Inc., Richmond, IN). Age (9 weeks)- and glucose-matched male Zucker diabetic fatty rats (Genetic Models, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were gavaged twice daily for 7 days with vehicle (0.05 m N-methylglucamine), GW1929 (5.0 mg/kg), or rosiglitazone (3.0 mg/kg). Glucose, triglycerides, and non-esterified fatty acids were measured as described previously (8Brown K.K. Henke B.R. Blanchard S.G. Cobb J.E. Mook R. Kaldor I. Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Harrington W.W. Novak P.J. Faison W. Binz J.G. Hashim M.A. Oliver W.O. Brown H.R. Parks D.J. Plunket K.D. Tong W.Q. Menius J.A. Adkison K. Noble S.A. Willson T.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Insulin-treated animals received a mixture of Humulin®N and Humulin®R (Lilly) by subcutaneous injection and were sacrificed 6 h later. Genetically obese ob/ob mice were from a colony maintained at Harvard; the db/db, tub/tub, and KKAy mice were from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were maintained on standard rodent chow. MCC-555 (20 mg/kg) was administered by daily gavage for 10 days. Rosiglitazone (5 mg/kg) and GW1929 (5 mg/kg) were administered by daily intraperitoneal injections. Ambient blood samples were obtained in the beginning and at the end of the treatment period, and tissues were collected for further analyses 4 h after food withdrawal. Total RNA from epididymal white adipose tissue was prepared from ZDF rats, resolved on agarose gels, and blotted as described previously (9Way J.M. Harrington W.W. Brown K.K. Gottschalk W.K. Sundseth S.S. Mansfield T.A. Ramachandran R.K. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Filters were prehybridized at 68 °C in Express-Hyb (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for 60 min, followed by hybridization to specific 32P-labeled cDNA probes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cpm/ml for 2 h at 68 °C. Filters were washed twice in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 20 min, followed by a single wash for 20 min in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 60 °C. A rat resistin cDNA clone was isolated from rat adipose tissue RNA by reverse transcriptase PCR using nucleotide sequence reported by Kim et al. (6Kim K.H. Lee K. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). PCR oligonucleotide sequences used were as follows: coding strand, CTGAGCTCTCTGCCACGTACT; non-coding strand, GCTCAGTTCTCAATCAACCGTCC. The cDNA was subcloned into pUC18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), sequenced to confirm its identity, and used in Northern blot analysis. Image analyses and quantitation from the phosphor screen were performed with a Storm optical scanner using the ImageQuant software package (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Mouse resistin cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase PCR based on the published sequence, cloned and sequenced to confirm its identity, and used in Northern blot analysis as described (10Tong Q. Dalgin G. Xu H. Ting C.N. Leiden J.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2000; 290: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Because resistin is identified as a gene negatively regulated by the insulin-sensitizing drug rosiglitazone, and its protein level is increased in the circulation of ob/ob and db/db mice relative to wild type controls (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to postulate that its expression in adipose tissue would also be increased in obesity. To address this, we examined resistin mRNA expression in several different genetic models of obesity/diabetes including the ob/ob, db/db, tub/tub, and KKAy mice compared with their age-matched lean littermates. Northern blot analysis under high stringency conditions revealed a single, 0.8-kilobase pair resistin mRNA as reported previously (Fig. 1) (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The resistin mRNA was readily detectable in the adipose tissue of all lean mice (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, resistin levels were severely decreased in the epididymal WAT of all models of obese mice relative to lean controls (Fig. 1). This suppression was most dramatic in the tub/tub (35-fold) and KKAy (50-fold) mice and was also very substantial in the ob/ob (20-fold) and db/db (15-fold) animals. A similar suppression in adipose tissue resistin mRNA expression was also observed in mice with diet-induced obesity (data not shown). Thus, obesity correlated with severely decreased WAT expression of resistin in these mouse models. We next examined the regulation of resistin expression in the WAT of male ob/ob mice treated with different PPARγ agonists including the thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and MCC-555 and the tyrosine derivative GW1929. Rosiglitazone and GW1929 are full PPARγ agonists (8Brown K.K. Henke B.R. Blanchard S.G. Cobb J.E. Mook R. Kaldor I. Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Harrington W.W. Novak P.J. Faison W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3460) Google Scholar). MCC-555 profiles as a low affinity full PPARγ agonist in cell-based assays but acts as a potent antidiabetic agent in vivo (12Reginato M.J. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Minami C. Ishii S. Tanaka H. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32679-32684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Treatment with rosiglitazone, GW1929, or MCC-555 resulted in 50, 50, and 30% reductions in serum glucose levels, respectively, relative to treatment with vehicle alone and significant increases in insulin sensitivity (data not shown). As expected, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that each of these compounds stimulated the expression of the PPARγ target genes fatty acid transporter protein (FATP) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (Fig. 2 A) in WAT. Surprisingly, treatment with each compound also resulted in an increase in resistin expression in WAT (Fig. 2, A and B). MCC-555 resulted in a greater increase (8.4-fold) in resistin expression compared with either rosiglitazone (3.4-fold increase) or GW1929 (2.2-fold increase). These data indicate that decreases in resistin expression are not required for the antidiabetic actions of three different PPARγ agonists in a standard genetic model of insulin resistance. We next examined the regulation of resistin in the WAT of ZDF rats treated with either rosiglitazone or GW1929. Treatment with rosiglitazone or GW1929 resulted in 46 and 74% decreases in glucose levels, respectively, relative to vehicle-treated animals (data not shown). Northern blot analysis with a resistin-specific probe revealed two transcripts ∼0.8 and 1.4 kilobase pairs in length (Fig.3 A). These transcripts are the same size as those reported previously for rat resistin (6Kim K.H. Lee K. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Similar to the ob/ob mice, Northern blot analysis revealed that rosiglitazone or GW1929 treatment resulted in an increase in resistin expression in WAT of ZDF rats (Fig. 3, A and B). In agreement with a previous report (6Kim K.H. Lee K. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), resistin expression was also induced by insulin treatment (Fig. 3 A). Thus both insulin itself and insulin sensitizers stimulate the expression of resistin in WAT. Resistin has been proposed to serve as a link between obesity and diabetes, with elevated levels of resistin promoting insulin resistance (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Moreover, PPARγ agonists have been proposed to enhance insulin sensitivity by decreasing resistin expression (5Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Our data do not support either of these proposals. We show that insulin resistance in several common rodent genetic models is associated with decreases in resistin expression. In addition, we demonstrate that different PPARγ agonists all stimulate resistin expression in two standard rodent models of type 2 diabetes. Although we were unable to determine resistin protein levels, it is unlikely that post-transcriptional regulation could account for the magnitude of differences observed in our study. Further studies are needed to determine the mode of regulation and biological functions of resistin and whether it is an effector of insulin resistance in obesity."

https://openalex.org/W1571440754,"Magnesium diboride, MgB2, was recently observed to become superconducting at 39 K, which is the highest known transition temperature for a non-copper-oxide bulk material. Isotope-effect measurements, in which atoms are substituted by isotopes of different mass to systematically change the phonon frequencies, are one of the fundamental tests of the nature of the superconducting mechanism in a material. In a conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductor, where the mechanism is mediated by electron-phonon coupling, the total isotope-effect coefficient (in this case, the sum of both the Mg and B coefficients) should be about 0.5. The boron isotope effect was previously shown to be large and that was sufficient to establish that MgB2 is a conventional superconductor, but the Mg effect has not hitherto been measured. Here we report the determination of the Mg isotope effect, which is small but measurable. The total reduced isotope-effect coefficient is 0.32, which is much lower than the value expected for a typical BCS superconductor. The low value could be due to complex materials properties, and would seem to require both a large electron-phonon coupling constant and a value of mu* (the repulsive electron-electron interaction) larger than found for most simple metals."
https://openalex.org/W1971962094,"Inverse melting is the process in which a crystal reversibly transforms into a liquid or amorphous phase when its temperature is decreased. Such a process is considered to be very rare, and the search for it is often hampered by the formation of non-equilibrium states or intermediate phases. Here we report the discovery of first-order inverse melting of the lattice formed by magnetic flux lines in a high-temperature superconductor. At low temperatures, disorder in the material pins the vortices, preventing the observation of their equilibrium properties and therefore the determination of whether a phase transition occurs. But by using a technique to 'dither' the vortices, we were able to equilibrate the lattice, which enabled us to obtain direct thermodynamic evidence of inverse melting of the ordered lattice into a disordered vortex phase as the temperature is decreased. The ordered lattice has larger entropy than the low-temperature disordered phase. The mechanism of the first-order phase transition changes gradually from thermally induced melting at high temperatures to a disorder-induced transition at low temperatures."

Although several groups of investigators have demonstrated substantial oxidizing and cytotoxic activities of chemically synthesized peroxynitrite, others have proposed that the relative rates of ⋅NO and production may be critical in determining the reactivity of peroxynitrite formed in situ(Miles, A.

In the present study, we examined the mechanisms by which excess O⨪2 or⋅NO production inhibits peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation reactions. Peroxynitrite was generated in situ by the co-addition of a chemical source of ⋅NO, spermineNONOate, and an enzymatic source of O⨪2, xanthine oxidase, with either hypoxanthine or lumazine as a substrate. We found that the oxidation of the model compound dihydrorhodamine by peroxynitrite occurred via the free radical intermediates OH and NO2, formed during the spontaneous decomposition of peroxynitrite and not via direct reaction with peroxynitrite. The inhibitory effect of excess O⨪2 on the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine could not be ascribed to the accumulation of the peroxynitrite scavenger urate produced from the oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase. A biphasic oxidation profile was also observed upon oxidation of NADH by the simultaneous generation of ⋅NO and O⨪2. Conversely, the oxidation of glutathione, which occurs via direct reaction with peroxynitrite, was not affected by excess production of ⋅NO.

Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the idea that peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant in vivo is well supported by studies utilizing chemically synthesized peroxynitrite (2Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A.

This contention was outlined in a study by Miles et al. (4Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) that examined oxidation reactions derived from the co-generation of⋅NO and O⨪2 at a neutral pH. Consistent with the formation of peroxynitrite, these investigators reported that the oxidation of the model compound dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR)1 to its fluorescent derivative rhodamine was maximum in the presence of equimolar fluxes of⋅NO and O⨪2. However, when one free radical was produced in excess of the other one, the oxidation of DHR was inhibited, possibly via secondary reactions occurring directly between peroxynitrite and excess ⋅NO or O⨪2. These observations as well as data recently published (5Pfieffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Goldstein S.

Although the aforementioned results raised important questions with regard to the formation and reactivity of peroxynitrite in vivo, a number of mechanistic and methodological limitations were brought recently to light that may limit the scope of these findings (10Reiter C.D. Teng R.J. Beckman J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32460-32466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 11Sawa T. Akaike T. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32467-32474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the direct reaction of ⋅NO with peroxynitrite is too slow to account for the inhibition of DHR oxidation observed with excess ⋅NO as suggested originally (12Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F.

Toxicol. 1998; 11: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicate that the cis- and not thetrans-conformer of peroxynitrite is formed at a neutral pH, which rules out any difference in reactivity for ⋅NO and O⨪2 between “authentic” alkalinecis-peroxynitrite and peroxynitrite formed in situ (10Reiter C.D. Teng R.J. Beckman J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32460-32466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). As to the methodological approach, one problem was related to the accumulation of urate formed from the oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase utilized to generate O⨪2. Urate might scavenge peroxynitrite and consequently inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation reactions. Questions also were raised regarding the ability to match fluxes of ⋅NO and O⨪2over long periods (hours). To gain further insights into the mechanism by which excess ⋅NO or O⨪2 might inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation reactions we characterized the kinetic of DHR oxidation by chemically synthesized peroxynitrite. We circumvented the aforementioned methodological problems by using an alternate substrate for xanthine oxidase to eliminate the production of urate and shorter incubation times to ensure equal rates of ⋅NO and O⨪2 production. In addition, we systematically evaluated the effect of excess ⋅NO on the peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of three different model compounds: DHR, NADH, and glutathione. Our results indicate that the inhibition of peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation reactions by excess⋅NO or O⨪2 occurs via scavenging of the hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) and nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2), which are formed from the decomposition of peroxynitrite. The physiological relevance of our findings is discussed. Catalase, copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase, and xanthine oxidase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DHR and rhodamine 123 were purchased from Molecular Probes. SpermineNONOate was obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Human recombinant manganese superoxide dismutase was obtained from Kabi-Pharmacis AB (Uppsala, Sweden). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The decomposition of peroxynitrite in the presence of DHR was determined every 100 ms by stop-flow absorbance spectrophotometry at 302 nm using a Shimadzu UV-1601 PC spectrometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Columbia, MD) equipped with a SFA-20 rapid kinetic instrument (Hi-Tech Ltd., Salisbury, United Kingdom). All solutions were purged with helium and degassed immediately before use to minimize the presence of adventitious bicarbonate. Reactions were initiated at 27 °C by mixing equal volumes of a solution consisting of 200 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.2 mm diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) with a solution of peroxynitrite (0–200 µm) diluted immediately before use in distilled water. The oxidation of DHR (0–150 µm in 100 mm phosphate buffer) to rhodamine 123 in the presence of 10 µm peroxynitrite was also studied at 27 °C and pH 7.4 by measuring the increase in fluorescence every 100 ms in a rapidly stirred temperature-controlled cuvette. Fluorescence measurements were obtained with an Aminco/Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM Instruments, Inc., Rochester, NY) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 536 nm, respectively. The kinetics of peroxynitrite decomposition and rhodamine 123 formation were fitted to a pseudo-first-order reaction equation by nonlinear regression (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Superoxide was generated at 37 °C using 500 µm hypoxanthine and various concentrations of xanthine oxidase (0–20 milliunits/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 100 µm DTPA. The initial rates of O⨪2 generation were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochromec at 550 nm. In some experiments, 500 µmlumazine was used in place of hypoxanthine as an alternate substrate for xanthine oxidase to avoid urate formation. Nitric oxide was generated using the spontaneous decomposition of the ⋅NO donor spermineNONOate (0–400 µm). SpermineNONOate solutions were prepared each day as a 10 mm stock solution in ice-cold 10 mm NaOH and stored on ice until used. The initial rate of ⋅NO generation via spermineNONOate decomposition at 37 °C and pH 7.4 was determined electrochemically using an⋅NO-specific electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The oxidation of DHR to rhodamine was determined at 37 °C by measuring the increase in rhodamine fluorescence every 5 s in a rapidly stirred temperature-controlled cuvette. Typical experiments contained 50 µm DHR, 100 µmDTPA, 500 µm hypoxanthine, and various concentrations of xanthine oxidase (0–20 milliunits/ml) and/or spermineNONOate (0–400 µm) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, 1 ml final volume). All solutions were purged with helium and degassed immediately before use to minimize carbonate contamination. DHR was prepared as a 25 mm stock solution in nitrogen-purged dimethyl formamide and kept stored in the dark at −20 °C until used. Fluorescence measurements were obtained with an Aminco/Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM Instruments, Inc.) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 536 nm, respectively. Autofluorescence, which did not exceed 10% of the total fluorescence, was corrected for by the inclusion of parallel blanks, and the concentration of rhodamine 123 was calculated using rhodamine 123 standards. In some experiments, the products obtained from the oxidation of DHR by ⋅NO and O⨪2 were quantified by reversed phase HPLC. Briefly, samples were submitted to filtration followed by extraction with acetone and resuspension in acetonitrile. The samples were then injected onto a 250 × 4.6-mm 5-µm octadecyl silane C18 ultrasphere column (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) isocratically running at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with 75% acetonitrile and 1% acetic acid in distilled water. Dihydrorhodamine and rhodamine were detected at 290 nm, and the identity of each peak was confirmed by co-elution with authentic standards. The recovery of standards through this procedure was better than 80%. No oxidation product other than rhodamine could be detected from the oxidation of DHR by ⋅NO and O⨪2, and both the fluorescence and the HPLC methods gave identical results. Therefore only one parameter, the increase in fluorescence, will be shown. The oxidation of NADH was determined at 37 °C by measuring the decrease in NADH fluorescence every 5 s in a rapidly stirred temperature-controlled cuvette. Typical experiments contained 50 µm NADH, 100 µm DTPA, 500 µm hypoxanthine, and various concentrations of xanthine oxidase (0–20 milliunits/ml) and/or spermineNONOate (0 to 200 µm) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, 1 ml final volume). Fluorescence measurements were obtained using excitation and emission wavelengths of 339 and 460 nm, respectively. NADH concentrations were determined from NADH standard curves. All solutions were purged with helium and degassed immediately before use. One-ml reaction volumes containing 1 mm GSH, 100 µm DTPA, 500 µmhypoxanthine, and various concentrations of xanthine oxidase (0–20 milliunits/ml) and/or spermineNONOate (0–400 µm) in phosphate-buffered saline were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. All solutions were purged with helium and degassed immediately before use. Samples were rapidly subjected to ultrafiltration using centrifugal filter units with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The ultrafiltrates were then immediately injected onto a 250 × 4.6-mm 5-µm octadecyl silane C18 ultrasphere column (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) isocratically running at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with 0.5% acetonitrile and 1% acetic acid in distilled water. Glutathione, glutathione disulfide, andS-nitrosoglutathione were detected at 220 and 334 nm, and the identity of each peak was confirmed by co-elution with authentic standards with a detection limit of 50 nmol. For groups of three or more, the data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and when a significant difference was suggested, the Tukey test was used as a post-hoc test. Comparisons restricted to two groups were analyzed using the Student'st test. A probability value of less than 0.05 was considered to represent a statistically significant difference. The reaction of DHR with peroxynitrite was studied under limiting concentrations of peroxynitrite at pH 7.4 and 27 °C (Fig.1). In the presence of a 5–15-fold excess of DHR, the increase in rhodamine concentration was first order. The apparent rate constant for the reaction was independent of the initial concentration of DHR, and it was within the experimental error identical to that of the self-decomposition of peroxynitrite at the same pH and temperature (Table I). These results indicated that the oxidation of DHR by peroxynitrite stemmed from its reaction with the intermediates formed during the self-decomposition of peroxynitrite and not from its direct reaction with peroxynitrite (14Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar).Table IApparent rate constants for the reaction of DHR with peroxynitriteDHRRateµms−100.22 ± 0.02500.25 ± 0.011000.25 ± 0.041500.24 ± 0.02The reaction of DHR with peroxynitrite was studied under limiting concentrations of peroxynitrite at pH 7.4 and 27 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Rate constants represent averages of five experiments. Open table in a new tab The reaction of DHR with peroxynitrite was studied under limiting concentrations of peroxynitrite at pH 7.4 and 27 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Rate constants represent averages of five experiments. To confirm that the oxidation of peroxynitrite was indirect, we performed a series of competition experiments between NADH, DHR, and glutathione as shown in Fig. 2. NADH and glutathione were selected because their reactivity toward peroxynitrite is different. NADH reacts with ⋅OH and⋅NO2 formed during the self-decomposition of peroxynitrite, whereas glutathione directly reacts with peroxynitrite at a neutral pH (7Goldstein S. Czapski G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NADH should inhibit competitively only those reactions that involve ⋅OH and ⋅NO2 and not peroxynitrite itself. In accordance, we found that NADH did not significantly inhibit the oxidation of glutathione (50 µm) by peroxynitrite (20 µm; see Fig. 2). However, NADH completely inhibited the oxidation of DHR (50 µm) by peroxynitrite (20 µm, IC50 = 4.96 µm), indicating that the main species oxidizing DHR were ⋅OH and/or⋅NO2. The oxidation of DHR by peroxynitrite generated in situ was studied previously by the co-addition of a chemical source of ⋅NO, spermineNONOate, and an enzymatic source of O⨪2, xanthine oxidase, with hypoxanthine as a substrate (4Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The advantage of this approach is the ability to evaluate DHR oxidation at different ⋅NO/O⨪2ratios. In the following experiments, we sought to re-evaluate this system in light of the recent studies suggesting a number of artifactual limitations (10Reiter C.D. Teng R.J. Beckman J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32460-32466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 11Sawa T. Akaike T. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32467-32474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). One problem was related to the accumulation of the peroxynitrite scavenger urate formed from the oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase that might inhibit the oxidation of DHR by peroxynitrite. Questions were also raised regarding the depletion of oxygen in solution upon oxidation of hypoxanthine, which in turn may affect the rate of O⨪2 production, reduce steady-state levels of peroxynitrite, and diminish DHR oxidation yields over time. To address these issues, we used lumazine as an alternative substrate for xanthine oxidase that does not form a peroxynitrite scavenger upon oxidation (16Nagano T. Fridovich I. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we verified that violapterin, the oxidation product of lumazine, did not inhibit the oxidation of DHR by peroxynitrite (data not shown). We also utilized shorter incubation times to ensure that oxygen depletion was not a limiting factor for maintaining equal rates of ⋅NO and O⨪2 production. Based on the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochromec, we observed a concentration-dependent generation of O⨪2 upon co-incubation of increasing concentration of xanthine oxidase with either hypoxanthine (500 µm) or lumazine (500 µm) (Fig.3 A). The rates of O⨪2generation for both substrates were linear for at least the first 10 min of incubation (data not shown). In the presence of lumazine, the amount of xanthine oxidase was adjusted to obtain the same rates of O⨪2 generation as for hypoxanthine (Fig. 3 A). The initial rate of ⋅NO generation via spermineNONOate decomposition at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 100 µm DTPA was determined electrochemically using an⋅NO-specific electrode. A linear relationship was found between the initial rate of ⋅NO release and spermineNONOate concentrations (0–400 µm; data not shown). Fig. 3 B illustrates a typical experiment in which DHR (50 µm) in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 µmDTPA was preincubated at 37 °C with a combination of either hypoxanthine (500 µm) and xanthine oxidase (1 milliunit/ml) or lumazine (500 µm) and xanthine oxidase (4 milliunits/ml). The rates of O⨪2 production in the presence of hypoxanthine and lumazine were 0.68 ± 0.01 and 0.69 ± 0.05 µm/min, respectively. Superoxide generation alone resulted in a low dose-dependent oxidation of DHR to rhodamine that was subtracted from the signal obtained in the presence of spermineNONOate to calculate the rate of rhodamine formation upon co-generation of O⨪2 and ⋅NO. After the addition of spermineNONOate (25 µm, 0.64 ± 0.01 µm/min ⋅NO generated), the formation of rhodamine was linear over the 150-s time frame examined. The concentration of spermineNONOate utilized was selected to establish a flux of ⋅NO that would match the fluxes of O⨪2. Under these specific conditions (equimolar fluxes of ⋅NO and O⨪2), the rates of rhodamine formation were 0.28 ± 0.04 and 0.26 ± 0.04 µm/min in the presence of hypoxanthine and lumazine, respectively. The efficiencies of rhodamine formation, relative to O⨪2 fluxes, were 39.43 and 37.68%, which was in good agreement with the yields of DHR oxidation by chemically synthesized peroxynitrite (14Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4 A, it was evident that the rates of rhodamine formation increased sharply from negligible amounts in the absence of O⨪2 to a maximum of 0.31 ± 0.04 µm/min and 0.26 ± 0.04 µm/min for hypoxanthine and lumazine, respectively. These maxima were attained for O⨪2 fluxes that were equal to those of⋅NO (0.64 ± 0.01 µm/min). Most importantly, excess O⨪2 production over ⋅NO completely inhibited rhodamine formation in a fashion that was identical for both hypoxanthine and lumazine. Fig. 4 B shows that neither O⨪2 nor ⋅NO alone at fluxes of ∼0.7 µm/min were capable of producing more than 0.04 µm/min rhodamine. In contrast, the rates of rhodamine formation of ∼0.3 µm/min were attained upon the generation of equimolar fluxes of ⋅NO and O⨪2. The addition of superoxide dismutase (0.5 mg/ml) but not catalase (15 µg/ml) inhibited the oxidation of DHR by more than 90%. All together, our results demonstrated that the inhibition of DHR oxidation seen in the presence of excess O⨪2 over ⋅NO could not be ascribed to the scavenging of peroxynitrite by urate produced from the oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase. This is because the utilization of lumazine, which does not form a peroxynitrite scavenger upon oxidation by xanthine oxidase, was also inhibitory in the presence of excess O⨪2 over ⋅NO. The oxidation of DHR with increasing fluxes of ⋅NO in the presence of a constant flux of O⨪2 is shown in Fig.5 A. The rate of rhodamine formation increased from undetectable levels to a maximum rate of 0.73 ± 0.08 µm/min for a flux of ⋅NO (1.49 ± 0.03 µm/min) that was ∼2-fold higher than the flux of O⨪2 applied to the system (0.73 ± 0.07 µm/min). Increasing ⋅NO fluxes above 1.5 µm/min produced a decrease in the rate of rhodamine formation such that when the flux of ⋅NO approached 4 µm/min, there was an ∼ 80% reduction in rhodamine formation. No oxidation product other than rhodamine could be detected from the oxidation of DHR by ⋅NO and O⨪2 using HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”), and both the fluorescence and the HPLC methods gave identical results (data not shown). Earlier, Kooy et al. (14Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) proposed that the one-electron oxidation product of DHR might reversibly reduce molecular oxygen to form O⨪2. It is possible that excess ⋅NO may drive this reaction by reacting with O⨪2, forming more peroxynitrite, which would increase the rate of rhodamine formation and shift the maximum to higher⋅NO/O⨪2 ratios. Thus, to investigate whether the oxidation of DHR by peroxynitrite generated O⨪2, we determined O⨪2 production by measuring the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome cspectrophotometrically as depicted in Fig. 5 B. We found that the addition of incremental amounts of DHR (0–150 µm) resulted in a statistically significant increase in the amount of O⨪2 formed upon incubation with peroxynitrite (20 µm), suggesting that the reaction of DHR with peroxynitrite indeed generated O⨪2. To further evaluate the physiological relevance of excess ⋅NO production on peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation reactions, we examined the oxidation of NADH by O⨪2 in the presence of various fluxes of ⋅NO (Fig. 6). The efficiency of the oxidation of NADH at equimolar fluxes of ⋅NO (0.37 ± 0.06 µm/min) and O⨪2 (0.40 ± 0.02 µm/min) was 88 ± 19%. This was consistent with the oxidation of NADH occurring via a chain reaction in which the one-electron oxidation product of NADH reduces molecular oxygen to yield O⨪2 and subsequent oxidation of NADH by O⨪2 (7Goldstein S. Czapski G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We found that the rate of NADH oxidation in the presence of a constant flux of O⨪2 (0.40 ± 0.02 µm/min) increased to a maximum of 0.89 ± 0.13 µm/min for a flux of ⋅NO of 1.17 ± 0.19 µm/min. In a fashion similar to DHR, increasing ⋅NO fluxes above 1.2 µm/min produced a decrease in NADH oxidation to levels observed in the absence of O⨪2. Increasing fluxes of ⋅NO in the absence of xanthine oxidase resulted only in minimal oxidation. The oxidation of glutathione to glutathione disulfide with increasing fluxes of ⋅NO in the presence or absence of a constant flux of O⨪2 is shown in Fig. 7. In the absence of O⨪2, glutathione disulfide increased from undetectable levels in the absence of ⋅NO to 40 µmfor a flux of ⋅NO of ∼8.0 µm/min (15-min incubation time). In the presence of a constant flux of O⨪2, the amounts of glutathione disulfide increased in a dose-dependent manner over fluxes of ⋅NO ranging from 0 to ∼8.0 µm/min. In fact, the amounts of glutathione disulfide formed were indistinguishable from those obtained in the absence of O⨪2 when ⋅NO fluxes reached ∼0.7 µm/min or higher. These results indicated that the oxidation of glutathione was not inhibited by increasing fluxes of⋅NO. This is consistent with previous studies showing that glutathione directly reacts with peroxynitrite at a neutral pH, in contrast to NADH and DHR, thus precluding any inhibitory effect of⋅NO via OH and NO2 scavenging (15Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although⋅NO reacts with peroxynitrite itself (5Pfieffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Merényi G. Lind J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), this reaction is too slow to inhibit the oxidation of glutathione in the presence of⋅NO and O⨪2. It is important to note thatS-nitrosoglutathione was also formed in micromolar concentrations with a shift to lower amounts formed when O⨪2was also produced because of the formation of peroxynitrite as shown previously (data not shown) (17Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Kim S.Y. Vodovotz Y. Pacelli R. Krishna M.C. Russo A. Mitchell J.B. Jourd'heuil D. Miles A.M. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11147-11151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite (ONOO−/ONOOH) is presumably formedin vivo through the diffusion-limited reaction of ⋅NO with O⨪2. Upon protonation to peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH, pK a = 6.8), the peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−) rapidly decomposes at physiological pH to form nitrate (NO 3−; Fig. 8) as well as free hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) and nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2). Recent studies indicate that the yield of⋅OH and ⋅NO2 formation approximates 25–35% in the absence of competitive reactions (18Coddington J.W. Hurst J.K. Lymar S.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2438-2443Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19Richeson C.E. Mulder P. Bowry V.W. Ingold K.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7211-7219Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, peroxynitrite-induced oxidation reactions include those directly mediated by peroxynitrite itself as well as those mediated indirectly by ⋅OH and ⋅NO2 (Fig. 8). In physiological settings where bicarbonate abounds, the formation of ⋅OH and⋅NO2 is limited by the reaction of peroxynitrite with carbon dioxide to form the nitrosoperoxocarbonate anion (ONOOCO 2−; Fig. 8), 33% of which decomposes to carbonate radical (CO⨪3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (20Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 37: 294-301Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Another important aspect related to the production of peroxynitrite in vivo is the fact that the timing and location of ⋅NO and O⨪2 production in tissues are different and have only a limited overlap such that peroxynitrite formation always occurs in excess of either ⋅NO or O⨪2(21Grisham M.B. Jourd'heuil D. Wink D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 39: G315-G321Google Scholar). The oxidative chemistry associated with the production of peroxynitrite in situ has been most often examined by using 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) (22Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16702-16708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or pulse radiolysis (7Goldstein S. Czapski G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to generate equimolar fluxes of ⋅NO and O⨪2. These methods do not allow for the examination of the effect of excess production of one free radical over the other. The use of NONOates and xanthine oxidase as a source of ⋅NO and O⨪2 has provided a unique opportunity to examine the oxidative and nitrative chemistry associated with peroxynitrite that would be expected to occur in vivo,i.e. at different ⋅NO/O⨪2 ratios (3Rubbo H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Kalyanaraman B. Barnes S. Kirk M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26066-26075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Miles A.M. Bohle D.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, a number of methodological limitations has been raised recently questioning the validity of the results obtained with this experimental approach (10Reiter C.D. Teng R.J. Beckman J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32460-32466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 11Sawa T. Akaike T. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32467-32474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mainly, oxidation reactions might be inhibited by the progressive accumulation of the peroxynitrite scavenger urate formed from the oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase. It is important to note that the first product formed from the oxidation of hypoxanthine is xanthine such that the accumulation of urate is considerably minimized, at least during the first few minutes of the experiment (16Nagano T. Fridovich I. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both xanthine and urate have similar absorption spectra, which may lead to misleading information if an increase in absorbance at 292 nm is taken as an indication of urate formation. In fact, the oxidation of the model compound DHR over time was linear (Fig. 3), which was inconsistent with the progressive accumulation of urate that would have resulted in the curving of the slope over time. Most importantly, substituting hypoxanthine with lumazine to eliminate the production of urate did not alter the biphasic oxidation profile of DHR in the presence of ⋅NO and increasing fluxes of O⨪2(Fig. 4). Thus, our results clearly indicated that the production of urate could not account for the inhibitory effect of excess O⨪2production on the oxidation of DHR by peroxynitrite generated in situ. Another possibility would be that the decrease in DHR oxidation with increased fluxes of O⨪2 or ⋅NO might involved the interaction of O⨪2 or ⋅NO with a free radical intermediate of DHR to yield adducts with diminished fluorescence (14Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). However, we failed to detect any oxidation product other than rhodamine utilizing HPLC techniques (data not shown). It is important to note that excess ⋅NO production also inhibited the oxidation of NADH, which is structurally different from DHR. This observation reinforces our opinion that the reaction pathways underlying the inhibitory effect of O⨪2 and ⋅NO are not specific to DHR and might apply to a large variety of physiologically relevant targets. Previous interpretations of the inhibition of the oxidation of DHR by excess ⋅NO or O⨪2 were based on the assumption that peroxynitrite directly oxidized DHR (4Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 14Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and that excess ⋅NO or O⨪2 reacted with peroxynitrite with a consequential inhibition of DHR oxidation. However, recent studies indicate that the reaction of ⋅NO with peroxynitrite is too slow to account for the inhibition seen, at least at high fluxes of ⋅NO (5Pfieffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Merényi G. Lind J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Herein, we show that the oxidation of DHR to rhodamine takes place indirectly via reaction with the ⋅OH and ⋅NO2formed during the self-decomposition of peroxynitrite (Figs. 1 and 2and Table I). These results indicate that competing reactions involving excess ⋅NO or O⨪2 with ⋅OH and/or⋅NO2 might represent important pathways by which the oxidative chemistry of peroxynitrite may be modulated. Both ⋅OH and ⋅NO2 oxidize DHR (14Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and the rate constants for the reaction of ⋅NO or O⨪2 with ⋅OH and/or⋅NO2 are high enough to be relevant in the presence of excess ⋅NO or O⨪2, as illustrated in TableII. Additional reactions such as the rapid reaction of nitrite (NO 2−) with⋅OH may also contribute to the inhibition associated with excess⋅NO production (Table II).Table IIRate constants for the reaction of ⋅OH and NO 2⋅ with ⋅NO, O⨪2, and nitritekm−1 · s−1⋅NO2 + ⋅NO → N2O31.1 × 109 2-aRate constants (studied at 25 °C) were taken from Ref. 7.⋅OH +⋅NO → HNO21.0 × 1010 2-aRate constants (studied at 25 °C) were taken from Ref. 7.⋅NO2 + O⨪2 → O2NOO−4.5 × 109 2-aRate constants (studied at 25 °C) were taken from Ref. 7.⋅OH + O⨪2 → OH− + O21.0 × 1010 2-bRate constant (studied at 25 °C) was taken from Ref. 27.NO⨪2+ ⋅OH → ⋅NO2 + OH−5.3 × 109 2-aRate constants (studied at 25 °C) were taken from Ref. 7.2-a Rate constants (studied at 25 °C) were taken from Ref. 7Goldstein S.

Open table in a new tab Another interesting aspect was the observation that the efficiency of DHR oxidation was increased from ∼40% at equimolar fluxes of⋅NO and O⨪2 to almost 100% upon generation of a 2-fold excess of ⋅NO over O⨪2 and then decreased at higher⋅NO fluxes (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with NADH (i.e. a shift of the maximum to higher⋅NO/O⨪2 ratios) that were reminiscent of simulation data suggesting that maximum oxidation yield of NADH in the presence of⋅NO and O⨪2 might be attained when ⋅NO is generated in excess over O⨪2 (7Goldstein S. Czapski G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We detected the formation of O⨪2 upon co-incubation of peroxynitrite with DHR (Fig. 5), which we attributed to the reversible reduction of molecular oxygen by the free radical intermediate formed from the oxidation of DHR with peroxynitrite (14Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 23Rota C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Excess ⋅NO might drive this reaction by reacting with O⨪2, forming additional peroxynitrite, which would increase the rate of rhodamine formation and shift the maximum to higher ⋅NO/O⨪2 ratios. Thus, the reaction of physiologically relevant substrates with one-electron oxidants produced during the decay of peroxynitrite may yield O⨪2. This may in turn alter oxidation yields when ⋅NO and O⨪2 are generated simultaneously, but ultimately excess ⋅NO will effectively inactivate any additional ⋅OH and/or⋅NO2 formed. As already mentioned, the reaction of peroxynitrite with carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major route for peroxynitrite activity in vivo (Fig. 8; Ref. 24Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We have already shown that the presence of CO2 did not alter the oxidation profile of DHR, suggesting that substantial inhibition of peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation reactions by excess ⋅NO might occur in vivo even in the presence of carbon dioxide (25Jourd'heuil D. Miranda K.M. Kim S.M. Espey M.G. Vodovotz Y. Laroux S. Mai C.T. Miles A.M. Grisham M.B. Wink D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this case, the inhibitory pathways would be similar to that of CO2-free peroxynitrite, in which excess ⋅NO would scavenge CO⨪3/⋅NO2 instead of⋅OH/⋅NO2 (7Goldstein S. Czapski G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In either case, dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), a potent nitrosating agent, is produced from the reaction of ⋅NO with NO2, which supports the notion that the oxidative chemistry of peroxynitrite is decreased in favor of nitrosation reactions in the presence of excess⋅NO (17Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Kim S.Y. Vodovotz Y. Pacelli R. Krishna M.C. Russo A. Mitchell J.B. Jourd'heuil D. Miles A.M. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11147-11151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition to oxidation reactions, peroxynitrite promotes the nitration of aliphatic and aromatic residues including the amino acid tyrosine (26Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Tyrosine is oxidized by the free radical intermediates derived from peroxynitrite to the tyrosyl radical, which then reacts with ⋅NO2 to form 3-nitrotyrosine (8Goldstein S. Czapski G. Lind J. Merényi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3031-3036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Pfeiffer and Mayer (5Pfieffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) reported that excess generation of O⨪2 over⋅NO inhibited the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine, suggesting that peroxynitrite-mediated nitration reactions in vivo may also be inhibited by excess production of O⨪2. The inhibition of tyrosine nitration is best explained by experimental and simulation data, showing that O⨪2 competes with ⋅NO2for the tyrosyl radical intermediate such that the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine may be inhibited when the rates of O⨪2generation exceed those of ⋅NO (8Goldstein S. Czapski G. Lind J. Merényi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3031-3036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Hodges G.R. Marwaha J. Paul T. Ingold K.U. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All together, this indicates that both oxidation and nitration reactions mediated by peroxynitrite are influenced greatly by the relative rates of⋅NO and O⨪2 production. In conclusion, the finding that excess production of ⋅NO or O⨪2 inhibits the oxidative chemistry associated with the production of peroxynitrite or CO2-peroxynitrite in situ provides an additional pathway that affects the fate of peroxynitrite in vitro and in vivo. In biologically relevant systems, only a small fraction of peroxynitrite will undergo spontaneous decomposition, because most peroxynitrite will be directly consumed through bimolecular reactions with a variety of molecules such as glutathione, cysteine, ascorbate, and bicarbonate. Whether the oxidative processes initiated by CO⨪3/⋅NO2 formed from the interaction of CO2 with peroxynitrite will be inhibited in vivoby excess ⋅NO or O⨪2 will depend on the presence and relative concentrations of biomolecules capable of competing with⋅NO or O⨪2 for CO⨪3/NO2."

In this paper, we have studied the possibility that D2 and D3receptors interact functionally by forming receptor heterodimers. Initially, we split the two receptors at the level of the third cytoplasmic loop into two fragments. The first, containing transmembrane domains (TM) I to V and the N-terminal part of the third cytoplasmic loop, was named D2trunk or D3trunk, and the second, containing the C-terminal part of the third cytoplasmic loop, TMVI and TMVII, and the C-terminal tail, was named D2tail or D3tail. Then we defined the pharmacological profiles of the homologous (D2trunk/D2tail and D3trunk/D3tail) as well as of the heterologous (D2trunk/D3tail and D3trunk/D2tail) cotransfected receptor fragments. The pharmacological profile of the cross-cotransfected fragments was different from that of the native D2 or D3 receptors. In most cases, the D3trunk/D2tail was the one with the highest affinity for most agonists and antagonists. Moreover, we observed that all of these receptor fragments reduced the expression of the wild type dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, suggesting that D2 and D3 receptors can form complexes with these fragments and that these complexes bind [3H]nemonapride less efficiently or are not correctly targeted to the membrane. In a second set of experiments, we tested the ability of the split and the wild type receptors to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC) types V and VI. All of the native and split receptors inhibited AC-V and AC-VI, with the exception of D3, which was unable to inhibit AC-VI. We therefore studied the ability of D2 and D3 to interact functionally with one another to inhibit AC-VI. We found that with D2 alone, R-(+)-7-hydroxydypropylaminotetralin hydrobromide inhibited AC-VI with an IC50 of 2.05 ± 0.15 nm, while in the presence of D2 and D3 it inhibited AC-VI with an IC50 of 0.083 ± 0.011 nm. Similar results were obtained with a chimeric cyclase made from AC-V and AC-VI. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that D2 and D3 receptors are capable of physical interaction.

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that D2 and D3 receptors are capable of physical interaction. adenylyl cyclase forskolin R-(+)-7-hydroxydypropylaminotetralin hydrobromide transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptors are seven-transmembrane domain proteins that mediate a variety of signaling processes. Dopamine receptors are members of this family and are important for a variety of functions in the nervous system, including drug reward, learning, motor activity, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Molecular cloning has revealed the existence of five different receptor subtypes that have been grouped into two different classes based on pharmacological and biochemical profiles: (i) the D1-like receptors, D1 and D5, are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC),1 and (ii) the D2-like receptors, D2, D3, and D4, are negatively coupled to this enzyme (for a review, see Ref. 1Sokoloff P. Schwartz J.-C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 270-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). An alternative splicing of 29 amino acids at the level of the third cytoplasmic loop of the dopamine D2 receptor leads to the generation of two molecular forms: the dopamine D2long (D2l) and D2short(D2s) receptors (2Dal Toso R Sommer B.

Fuchs S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5872-5878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Traditionally, the interaction of G protein-coupled receptors has been described by models that assume that the receptor exists as a monomer coupled to G protein in a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, these classical models of receptor/G protein coupling may be oversimplified. It has now been shown that many G protein-coupled receptors can form dimers or higher order oligomers and that this phenomenon has relevance to receptor function (for a review, see Ref. 6Hebert T.E. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Dopamine receptors have also been shown to form dimers and higher order oligomers. Evidence has been provided for D1, D2, and D3homodimers in transfected cell lines (7Ng G.Y.K. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Chung H.T. Brann M.R. Seeman P. George S.R Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Tallerico T. Seeman V. Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rocheville et al. (11Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Patel S.C. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. Science. 2000; 288: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the dopamine D2 receptors not only form homodimers but also form heterodimers with somatostatin SSTR5 receptors. In addition, Gines et al. (12Gines S. Hillion J. Torvinen M. Le Crom S. Casado V. Canela E.I. Rondin S. Lew J.Y. Watson S. Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Vernier P. Lluis C. Ferrè S. Fuxe K. Franco R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 15: 8606-8611Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar) have shown that the dopamine D1 receptor forms hetero-oligomers with the adenosine A1 receptor. As the issue of G protein-coupled receptor homo- and heterodimerization is becoming more and more important, it is crucial to define the mechanism(s) of receptor-receptor interactions in order to predict which receptors can interact with one another. The results obtained until now suggest that more than one mechanism exists and that one receptor can interact with another in more than one way. One of the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain receptor dimerization is the phenomenon of domain swapping proposed by Gouldsonet al. (13Gouldson P.R. Snell C.R. Reynolds C.A. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3871-3886Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Gouldson P.R. Snell C.R. Bywater R.P. Higgs C. Reynolds C.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Domain swapping is a very efficient method for forming dimers, since the interactions within the monomers are being preserved in the dimer. We have previously shown that this mechanism occurs between two chimeras of α2-adrenergic and m3-muscarinic receptors (15Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar); more recently, using a pharmacological approach, we have shown that domain swapping also occurs between the wild type m2- and m3-muscarinic receptors (16Maggio R. Barbier P. Colelli A. Salvadori F. Demontis M.-G. Corsini G.-U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 251-257PubMed Google Scholar). Since different dopamine receptors (including D2 and D3) are often physiologically coexpressed in the same cells (17Le Moine C. Bloch B. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Gurevich E.V. Joyce J.N. Neuropsycopharmacology. 1999; 20: 60-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), we decided to use this same domain swapping approach to identify the interaction between the D2- and D3-dopamine receptors. As mentioned above, these two receptors belong to the family of D2-like receptors, and they share a high degree of amino acid homology and are therefore suitable for an interaction through domain swapping. We have previously shown that the dopamine D2 receptor can be split at the level of the third cytoplasmic loop into two fragments (D2trunk and D2tail) and that the mixture of the two fragments retains the binding and functional activity of the wild type receptor (19Scarselli M. Armogida M. Chiacchio S. Demontis M.-G. Colzi A. Corsini G.U. Maggio R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 397: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended this analysis to the D3 receptor, and in addition, we cross-cotransfected the fragments originating from the two dopamine receptors in order to study the pharmacology of the mixed D2trunk/D3tail or D3trunk/D2tail receptor fragments. We further investigated whether the wild type D2 and D3receptors can functionally interact to inhibit AC. The results show that, indeed, the cotransfection of fragments originating from D3 was able to rescue in full the pharmacology and the functional activity of this receptor. Moreover, the mixed D2trunk/D3tail and D3trunk/D2tail receptor fragments were able to bind dopamine ligands and to inhibit AC activity. The D2receptor was able to rescue the ability of the dopamine D3receptors to inhibit AC type VI in conditions under which the D3 receptor by itself does not communicate with this AC isozyme (20Robinson S.W. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments provide further confidence that D2 and D3 receptors are able to physically interact. Together, these results demonstrate the formation of functional, active D2-D3 heterodimers. [3H]Adenine and [3H]nemonapride were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; forskolin (FS), pertussis toxin, clozapine, (−)-quinpirole, R-(−)-apomorphine, R-(+)-7-hydroxydypropylaminotetralin hydrobromide (7-OH-DPAT), dopamine, and haloperidol were from Sigma; Ro-20–1724 was from Calbiochem. Olanzapine and pergolide were from Lilly; domperidone and BP897 were kindly provided by Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Beerse, Belgium) and C. G. Wermuth (Université Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France), respectively. Tissue culture media and sera were from Sigma and Life Technologies, Inc. Full-length cDNA (∼2.1 kilobase pairs) coding for the rat dopamine D2s receptor was subcloned between theHindIII and ApaI sites of the pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct, pRc/CMV-D2s, was used to prepare the D2trunk and D2tail receptor fragments (Fig. 1; see Ref. 20Robinson S.W. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar for details). A full-length cDNA (∼1.4 kilobase pairs) encoding the rat D3 receptor was subcloned in the pRc/CMV vector between theEcoRI and SalI sites of the pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen). For the construction of the truncated receptor fragments, polymerase chain reaction was utilized. The D3trunkfragment (containing the extracellular N-terminal part of the D3 receptor, TMI–TMV and the proximal portion of the i3 loop until Ser-315) was obtained using two primers: the sense primer, containing a HindIII site and spanning the start codon (underlined) of the dopamine D3 receptor (CCCAAGCTTCCATGGCACCTCTGAGCCAG), and the antisense primer, containing a stop codon and an XbaI site and spanning the region of Ser-315 (GCTCTAGATCAGCTTGGGTGTCTCAAGGCA). The amplified polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with HindIII and XbaI and introduced into the polylinker region of the pRc/CMV vector. The D3tail fragment (containing the distal portion of the i3 loop starting from Glu-317, TMVI and TMVII, and the C-terminal part of the D3 receptor) was constructed using two primers: the sense primer, containing a HindIII site and an initiation ATG codon and spanning the codon for Glu-317 of the dopamine D3 receptor (CCCAAGCTTCCATGGAAGGCGGGGCAGGGATGA), and the antisense primer, containing an XbaI site and spanning the region of the stop codon (GCTCTAGAGTGCGGTCTCTTCTCCTC). The amplified polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested withHindIII and XbaI and introduced into the polylinker region of the pRc/CMV vector. Mouse D2l and D3l subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA/Neo (Stratagene) were kindly provided by Dr. Sara Fuchs. Binding experiments were performed with rat dopamine receptors, while functional experiments were performed with mouse and rat dopamine receptors. Descriptions of the cDNAs for rabbit AC-V in pXMD1 and rat AC-VI in pCMV-neo were given previously (21Avidor-Reiss T. Nevo I. Saya D. Bayewitch M. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5040-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the AC-V/VI chimera was prepared in pXMD1 by joining the cDNA encoding amino acids 1–856 of rabbit AC-V with that encoding amino acids 774–1166 of rat AC-VI at an AflIII site. The junction was made at an area of homology between AC-V and AC-VI in the carboxy part of the ninth transmembrane domain of the AC molecules. COS-7 cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (containing 5% CO2) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106/100-mm dish. 24 h later, they were transiently transfected with the plasmid DNA encoding the dopamine receptors and, when indicated, also AC types V and VI, by the DEAE-dextran chloroquine method (22Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA used for each transfection was completed to 4 µg by the addition of an appropriate amount of vector DNA. For the binding assays, in order to increase the expression of the receptors, cells were incubated with 5 mm sodium butyrate (sterilized by filtration) for the last 24 h before membrane preparation. Three days after transfection, confluent plates of cells were lysed by replacing the medium with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (1 mm Na-HEPES, 2 mm EDTA). After 20 min, the cells were scraped off the plate and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 20 min. The lysed cell pellet was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in the binding assay buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 155 mm NaCl, 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Binding of [3H]nemonapride (82 Ci/mmol) was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 1 ml. Dopamine (2 mm) was used to define nonspecific binding. For saturation experiments, seven different concentrations of the radioligand [3H]nemonapride were used. Displacement experiments were performed with 12 concentrations of the unlabeled competitor in the presence of a fixed concentration of the radioligand. In competition binding studies in which agonists were used, the membranes were resuspended in assay buffer containing 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.025% ascorbic acid. The bound ligand was separated from the unbound ligand using glass fiber filters (Whatman; GF/B) with a Brandel Cell Harvester, and the filters were counted with a scintillation β-counter. 24 h after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and recultured in 24-well plates, and after an additional 24 h, the cells were assayed for AC activity. The assay was performed in triplicate as described by Avidor-Reiss et al.(23Avidor-Reiss T. Bayewitch M. Levy R. Matus-Leibovitch N. Nevo I. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29732-29738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells in the 24-well plates were incubated for 2 h with 0.25 ml/well of fresh growth medium containing 5 µCi/ml [3H]adenine, and this medium was replaced with 0.5 ml/well of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.5 mm) and RO-20–1724 (0.5 mm). AC activity was stimulated by the addition of 1 µm FS in the presence or absence of the indicated dopamine receptor ligands. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the medium was removed, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of perchloric acid containing 0.1 mm unlabeled cAMP, followed by neutralization with KOH. The amount of [3H]cAMP formed was determined by a two-step column separation procedure, as described by Avidor-Reiss et al. (23Avidor-Reiss T. Bayewitch M. Levy R. Matus-Leibovitch N. Nevo I. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29732-29738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Immunopreceipitation and immunoblotting were carried out essentially as described by Karpaet al. (24Karpa K.D. Lin R. Kabbani N. Levenson R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, FLAG-tagged human D2 and HA-tagged monkey D3 dopamine receptors were expressed either singly or together in HEK 293 cells. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and immunocomplexes were captured using Protein A/G resin (CytoSignal, Irvine, CA). Following separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transfer to nitrocellulose filters, proteins were detected using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). We had previously shown that the dopamine D2 receptor can be split at the level of the third cytoplasmic loop and retains its pharmacological and functional characteristics (19Scarselli M. Armogida M. Chiacchio S. Demontis M.-G. Colzi A. Corsini G.U. Maggio R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 397: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this work, we extended this analysis to the dopamine D3 receptor. The mixture of D3trunk and D3tail fragments (defined as D3trunk/D3tail; Fig.1) was coexpressed in COS-7 cells, and the cells were tested for binding. The radioligand [3H]nemonapride bound with high affinity to the split dopamine D3 receptor, and the K D was not significantly different from that of the wild type receptor (TableI). Neither of the two fragments, when transfected alone, bound [3H]nemonapride (data not shown). The pharmacological profile of the split D3trunk/D3tail receptor perfectly superimposed over that of the dopamine D3 receptor (Table I). These results show that the two halves of the D3 receptor recognize each other to form an active complex.Table IComparison of the binding profile of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors with the split trunk/tail dopamine receptorsD2D2trunk/D2tailD2trunk/D3tailD3trunk/D2tailD3trunk/D3tailD3[3H]Nemonapride binding parametersK d(nm)0.0140.0160.0950.0100.0600.064B max(fmol/mg)1331162159303821125Antagonists (displacement, K i(nm))Clozapine64.263.113422.4188161Olanzapine12.615.3904.8046.640.6Haloperidol1.011.632.392.595.575.04Domperidone0.520.573.081.0214.411.7Agonists (displacement, IC50corr (nm))Dopamine31403260582483124111Quinpirole4784432145413622925Pergolide32.027.55.595.852.415.12Apomorphine11813569.524.327.229.47-OH-DPAT19218059.04.841.111.25BP89724.228.327.51.020.720.41Saturation and displacement binding experiments were performed in membranes of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the indicated receptors.

The IC50corrrepresents the concentration of the unlabeled ligand that displaces 50% of the labeled sites, corrected for the radioligand occupancy. In a second set of experiments, we tested whether or not the cross-cotransfection of fragments originating from D2 and D3 results in the formation of protein complexes that are able to bind [3H]nemonapride. We found that D2trunk mixed with D3tail(D2trunk/D3tail) and D3trunk mixed with D2tail (D3trunk/D2tail) receptor complexes were both able to bind [3H]nemonapride with high affinity (Table I). We next defined the pharmacological profile of these mixed receptors. The two antipsychotic drugs, clozapine and olanzapine, showed the highest affinity for the split D3trunk/D2tail receptor complex, with a 3-fold gain in affinity with respect to D2 and about 8-fold gain in affinity with respect to D3 (Table I). Furthermore, the D3trunk/D2tail receptor fully retained a high affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor-preferring antagonist domperidone, while the split D2trunk/D3tailreceptor complex showed an intermediate affinity (between the values for the D2 and D3 receptors) for this compound (Table I). Among the dopamine agonists, pergolide and apomorphine showed a high affinity for the split D3trunk/D2tail receptor, with a 5-fold gain in affinity with respect to D2, while dopamine and quinpirole had intermediate affinities for the split heteroreceptors, between those of the wild type D2 and D3 receptors (Table I). We also tested two highly selective agonists for the D3 receptor, 7-OH-DPAT and BP897. Both of them displayed high affinity for the split D3trunk/D2tail receptor similar to that of the wild type D3 receptor and a gain in affinity with respect to D2 of 40- and 24-fold for 7-OH-DPAT and BP897, respectively (Table I). All of the agonists gave inhibition curves that were best fitted by a one-site model. The high degree of scatter in the binding data, together with the small proportion of receptors in the high affinity state has precluded a two-site fit. However, since some curves had a Hill coefficient significantly lower than 1, we preferred to express the data as IC50 corrected for the radioligand occupancy (IC50corr). Receptor fragments were also cotransfected with the wild type D2 and D3 receptors, and the cells were tested for binding, in order to see if an eventual interaction between fragment and receptor could result in a modification of the binding affinity to selected compounds. To this end, we cotransfected the cells with either dopamine D2 receptor together with the D3trunk fragment or with D3 receptor together with the D2tail fragment, and we tested the binding affinity of 7-OH-DPAT and of domperidone. In both cases, we found that none of the fragments modified the affinity of 7-OH-DPAT and domperidone for the wild type receptors (data not shown). Despite this apparent lack of interaction in terms of binding affinity, all of the fragments interfered with the expression level of the wild type receptors. As shown in Table II, all of the four receptor fragments reduced the number of D2 and D3 receptor binding sites. As shown here for the D2trunk mixed with the D2 receptor, this phenomenon could be directly correlated with the amount of D2trunk cDNA used in the transfection (Table II). As control, we showed that expression of the truncated muscarinic m2 receptor, m2trunk, did not modify expression of full-length dopamine D2 or D3 receptors (Table II).Table IIEffect of receptor fragments on the expression (in binding capacity, in fmol/mg of protein) of D2 and D3 in transfected COS cellsFragment (µg)D2 receptor,B maxD3 receptor,B max1 µg2 µg1 µg2 µgfmol/mg proteinfmol/mg proteinVector (2–3)735 ± 541125 ± 68632 ± 411258 ± 112m2trunk (1)672 ± 471262 ± 101662 ± 751210 ± 92D2trunk (1)251 ± 29710 ± 35312 ± 37769 ± 48D2trunk (2)145 ± 17D2trunk (3)83 ± 9D2tail (1)301 ± 41840 ± 42295 ± 32758 ± 32D3trunk (1)331 ± 33815 ± 62187 ± 18819 ± 39D3tail (1)340 ± 69765 ± 25211 ± 26806 ± 47Dopamine receptor density (B max) was detected by radioligand binding assay in membranes of COS-7 cells transiently cotransfected with 1 or 2 µg of the D2 or D3 receptor and the indicated amounts of receptor fragments (in µg).

The data represent the means ± S.E. of two experiments, each performed in duplicate. In the second part of the work, we tested whether agonist activation of the split dopamine receptors has the ability to regulate the activity of AC and thus to inhibit the FS-induced increase in cAMP production. For this purpose, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with dopamine receptors, together with AC-V. As shown in TableIII, both wild type D2 and D3 as well as the split dopamine receptors were able to inhibit AC-V when activated by quinpirole. The calculated IC50 values for inhibition by quinpirole were in the nanomolar range. However, the wild type D3 receptor showed a 3-fold higher potency than D2 (IC50values were 0.68 ± 0.24 and 2.23 ± 0.34 nm for the D3 and D2 receptors, respectively). Moreover, the extent of inhibition was different among the receptors; the largest inhibition was observed with the dopamine D2receptor (61.4 ± 5.9%), while the weakest was seen with the D3 receptor, 25.2 ± 9.5% (Fig.2 A). The split D2and D3 receptors (D2trunk/D2tailand D3trunk/D3tail) gave an inhibition of 35.1 ± 7.5 and 40.7 ± 8.1%, respectively. The two mixed split receptors, D2trunk/D3tail and D3trunk/D2tail, gave a percentage inhibition of 32.5 ± 4.4 and 37.4 ± 2.1%, respectively.Table IIIRelative potency of quinpirole and 7-OH-DPAT on the inhibition of AC-V and AC-VI via D2, D3, and various combinations of split dopamine receptorsReceptorQuinpirole AC-V, IC507-OH-DPAT AC-V, IC507-OH-DPAT AC-VI, IC50nmD22.23 ± 0.343.91 ± 1.013.58 ± 1.14D2trunk/D2tail0.93 ± 0.294NDNDD2trunk/D3tail1.06 ± 0.274.32 ± 1.326.72 ± 2.39D3trunk/D2tail0.82 ± 0.240.121 ± 0.0160.093 ± 0.014D3trunk/D3tail1.59 ± 0.14NDNDD30.68 ± 0.240.074 ± 0.011NIThe amount of DNA transfected for each fragment or wild type receptor was 1 µg, while the amount of DNA for AC-V or AC-V1 was 2 µg.

https://openalex.org/W2055032002,"Abstract An elevated concentration of plasma total homocysteine is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Greater than 80% of circulating homocysteine is covalently bound to plasma protein by disulfide bonds. It is known that albumin combines with cysteine in circulation to form albumin-Cys34-S–S-Cys. Studies are now presented to show that the formation of albumin-bound homocysteine proceeds through the generation of an albumin thiolate anion. Incubation of human plasma withl-35S-homocysteine results in the association of >90% of the protein-bound 35S-homocysteine with albumin as shown by nonreduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Treatment of the complex with β-mercaptoethanol results in near quantitative release of the boundl-35S-homocysteine, demonstrating that the binding of homocysteine to albumin is through a disulfide bond. Furthermore, using an in vitro model system to study the mechanisms of this disulfide bond formation, we show that homocysteine binds to albumin in two steps. In the first step homocysteine rapidly displaces cysteine from albumin-Cys34-S–S-Cys, forming albumin-Cys34 thiolate anion and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide. In the second step, albumin thiolate anion attacks homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide to yield primarily albumin-Cys34-S–S-Hcy and to a much lesser extent albumin-Cys34-S–S-Cys. The results clearly suggest that when reduced homocysteine enters circulation, it attacks albumin-Cys34-S–S-Cys to form albumin-Cys34thiolate anion, which in turn, reacts with homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide or homocystine to form albumin-bound homocysteine."

https://openalex.org/W2003118746,"Archaebacteria thrive in environments characterized by anaeobiosis, saturated salt, and both high and low extremes of temperature and pH. The bulk of their membrane lipids are polar, characterized by the archaeal structural features typified by ether linkage of the glycerol backbone to isoprenoid chains of constant length, often fully saturated, and with sn-2,3 stereochemistry opposite that of glycerolipids of Bacteria and Eukarya. Also unique to these bacteria are macrocyclic archaeol and membrane spanning caldarchaeol lipids that are found in some extreme thermophiles and methanogens. To define the barrier function of archaebacterial membranes and to examine the effects of these unique structural features on permeabilities, we investigated the water, solute (urea and glycerol), proton, and ammonia permeability of liposomes formed by these lipids. Both the macrocyclic archaeol and caldarchaeol lipids reduced the water, ammonia, urea, and glycerol permeability of liposomes significantly (6–120-fold) compared with diphytanylphosphatidylcholine liposomes. The presence of the ether bond and phytanyl chains did not significantly affect these permeabilities. However, the apparent proton permeability was reduced 3-fold by the presence of an ether bond. The presence of macrocyclic archaeol and caldarchaeol structures further reduced apparent proton permeabilities by 10–17-fold. These results indicate that the limiting mobility of the midplane hydrocarbon region of the membranes formed by macrocyclic archaeol and caldarchaeol lipids play a significant role in reducing the permeability properties of the lipid membrane. In addition, it appears that substituting ether for ester bonds presents an additional barrier to proton flux.

Academic Press, New York1985: 459-497Google Scholar). The major role of the cell membrane is to provide a selective barrier between the external environment and the inside of the cell. Given the extreme environmental conditions in which these bacteria thrive, it is not surprising that their plasma membranes are composed of lipids that differ markedly in structure and physicochemical properties from the glycerolipids of eubacterial, animal, and plant cell membranes. In these unique bacteria, the membrane lipids are characterized by the presence of ether linkages instead of ester linkages, and they contain regularly branched phytanyl and biphytanyl chains instead of fatty acyl chains (6Sprott G.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The presence of ether rather than ester bonds is thought to contribute to greater chemical stability at extreme pH. Moreover the glycerol ethers contain an sn-2,3 stereochemistry that is opposite that of the naturally occurring sn-1,2 stereochemistry of glycerophospholipids of the other domains (7Kates M. Kates M. Kushner D.J. Matheson A.T. The Biochemistry of Archaea). Elsevier, New York1993: 261-295Google Scholar). The basic lipid core structures of these unique organisms are summarized in Fig. 1 (6Sprott G.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,7Kates M. Kates M. Kushner D.J. Matheson A.T. The Biochemistry of Archaea). Elsevier, New York1993: 261-295Google Scholar). There are two major classes of archaebacterial lipids, the archaeol lipids (diphytanyl glycerol diethers) and the caldarchaeol lipids (dibiphytanyl diglycerol tetraethers). 1Archaeobacterial lipids were designated using the nomenclature proposed for core lipid moieties (49Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); here, AS refers to 2.3-di-0-phytanyl-sn-glycerol, and caldarchaeol refers to 2,2′,3,3′-tetra-0-dibiphytanyl-sn-diglycerol. Variations in cores herein are shown as AM and CP(cyclopentane rings (P) designated from 0 to 8). The caldarchaeol lipids span the membrane, and liposomes made from these lipids form a monolayer as opposed to the bilayer formed with conventional glycerophospholipids (8Elferink M.G. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Beveridge T.J. Choquet C.G. Patel G.B. Sprott G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the tetraether lipids are phosphoglycolipids containing one or more sugar residues on one pole, most commonly gulose, glucose, mannose, or galactose, and a phosphopolyol moiety, such as phosphoglycerol, or inositol on the other. The more bulky sugar residue(s) may be expected to face outward, and the phosphate residue may be expected to face toward the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (10De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Nicolaus B. J. Biol. Sci. 1983; 16: 287-294Google Scholar). Depending on the growth temperature, certain thermophilic archaea are capable of controlling membrane fluidity by altering the number of cyclopentane rings from 0 to 8 in the caldarchaeol lipid chains (11De Rosa M. Esposito E. Gambacorta A. Nicolaus B. Bu'Lock J.D. Phytochemistry. 1980; 19: 827-831Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The macrocyclic archaeol lipid has so far been found only in M. jannaschii (6Sprott G.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and Methanococcus igneus (12Trincone A. Nicolaus B. Palmieri G. De Rosa M. Huber R. Huber G. Stetter K.O. Gambacorta A. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 11-17Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transport of small molecules across lipid bilayers is a fundamental biological process. Most of the biologically important transport of ions and bulky molecules with very low permeability across the lipid component of the membrane occurs through proteins. Small, uncharged molecules (e.g. water, ammonia, urea, and glycerol), however, permeate across the lipid component of the membrane at an appreciable rate. The archaebacterial lipid membranes have been shown to exhibit low permeability to protons and 5,6-carboxyfluorescein (8Elferink M.G. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Indeed, the caldarchaeol lipids of T. acidophilum form liposomes that retain carboxyfluorescein even during brief autoclaving at 121 °C (13Choquet C.G. Patel G.B. Sprott G.D. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 183-186Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Elferink et al. (8Elferink M.G. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) showed that in liposomes made from caldarchaeol lipids of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, which has an optimal growth temperature of 85 °C at pH 2.0, there is remarkable thermal and mechanical stability. Also, at temperatures below 40 °C, proton permeability was barely detectable. In a similar study of the major polar lipids from S. acidocaldarius, it was shown that membrane surface charge was responsible for low CF2 permeability but not for proton permeability. The low proton permeability was attributed to tight and rigid packing of the lipids in these membranes (14Komatsu H. Chong P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because some archaebacteria, including some wall-less strains, live and thrive in highly adverse environments, it appears likely that their plasma membranes exhibit strikingly low permeabilities to water, small nonelectrolytes such as urea, and gases such as ammonia. In addition to the question of bacterial comparative biology, the unique lipids of the membranes of Archaea can provide us with a detailed understanding of the chemical mechanisms governing the permeation of small molecules across membranes. By comparing the permeabilities of liposomes prepared from the lipids shown in Fig. 1, we can begin to examine how permeability may be influenced by the following factors: 1) the methyl groups along the aliphatic chains (Escherichia coli lipids versus Dph-PC); 2) the ester versus the ether linkages between the aliphatic chains and the glycerol backbone of the lipid (Dph-PC versusarchaeol); and 3) the effects of limiting the mobility of the distal ends of the aliphatic chains (archaeol versus AMand CP lipids). These studies permit us to define how archaebacteria can survive in hostile environments and the role of different components of lipid structure in impeding the flux of small molecules. These results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of permeation of biological membranes. H. salinarum (ATCC 33170) was grown aerobically as described in Ref. 15Sprott G.D. Agnew B.J.

Following growth at optimal conditions (17Sprott G.D. Meloche M. Richards J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3907-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), lipids were extracted from frozen-thawed cell paste by the Bligh and Dyer method, and total polar lipids were obtained by acetone precipitation as described earlier (18Swain M.

All archaeal polar lipid extracts were analyzed by negative-ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and the analysis of ions obtained was consistent with that reported earlier (17Sprott G.D. Meloche M. Richards J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3907-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A comparison of m/z values of all polar lipids detected from batch to batch indicated that similar proportions of core lipids were present in each lipid mixture extracted from fresh biomass (6Sprott G.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 3–4 mg of lipids were dissolved in chloroform-methanol (2:1) and dried at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen. Residual traces of solvent were removed by placing the lipids in an evacuated chamber for at least 3 h followed by bath sonication in a buffer containing 15 mmCF, 155 mm KCl, and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. Caldarchaeol lipids from T. acidophilum and macrocyclic archaeol-rich lipids from M. jannaschii were bath-sonicated for 16–20 min, whereas the lipids from other archaea and commercial lipids were sonicated for 4–6 min. The liposomal suspension was left overnight and extruded through a 0.2-µm polycarbonate filter (20 passes) using the Avanti-mini extruder assembly (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL). The un-entrapped CF was removed by passing the liposome suspension over a Sephadex PD-10 column. Liposomes were sized by quasi-elastic light scattering using a DynaPro LSR particle size analyzer. All liposome preparations behaved as homogeneous population and showed a mean diameter of 161 ± 22, 164 ± 26, 156 ± 16, 168 ± 14, 174 ± 27, and 189 ± 30 nm (n = 3) for E. coli, Dph-PC, As, As+C0, AM + C0 + As, and CP + Asliposomes, respectively. Osmotic water permeability (P f) was measured at 25 °C as described (19Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 20Negrete H.O.

Liposomes containing 15 mm CF were abruptly exposed to a doubling of external osmolarity in a stopped-flow fluorometer (SF.17 MV, Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, United Kingdom) with a measurement dead time of less than 1 ms. The rate of water efflux from liposomes was measured as a decrease of CF fluorescence due to self-quenching of the fluorophore. Data from 8–10 measurements were averaged and fitted to a single exponential curve. The P f was calculated using the following equation, dV(t)/dt=(Pf)(SAV)(MVW){[Cin/V(t)]−Cout}(Eq. 1) where V(t) is the relative volume of the liposomes at time t, SAV is the surface area to volume ratio, MVW is the molar volume of water (18 cm3/mol), andC in and C out are the initial concentrations of solute inside and outside the liposomes, respectively. Using parameters, which included the rate constant, vesicle diameter, and applied osmotic gradient, P fwas calculated using MathCad software (MathSoft Inc., Cambridge, MA) as described earlier (22Grossman E.B. Harris Jr., H.W. Star R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1109-C1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Permeability measurements were performed as described using a stopped-flow fluorometer (21Rivers R. Blanchard A. Eladari D. Leviel F. Paillard M. Podevin R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar, 22Grossman E.B. Harris Jr., H.W. Star R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1109-C1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hill W.G.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C367-C374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, liposomes were equilibrated in buffer (500 mosmol/kg) containing 200 mm solute (glycerol or urea) for 2 h at room temperature. In the stopped-flow device, liposomes were rapidly mixed with an equal volume of a solution with identical osmolality containing 100 mm solute. The concentration gradient results in solute efflux from liposomes followed by water efflux. Vesicle shrinkage can be monitored due to CF self-quenching. By use of parameters from the single exponential curve fit to the data,P solute was solved using MathCad software as described earlier (22Grossman E.B. Harris Jr., H.W. Star R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1109-C1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hill W.G. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30176-30185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Osmolalities of all solutions were confirmed and adjusted, if necessary, by measuring freezing point depression on a Precision Instruments Osmette A osmometer. Apparent proton permeabilities were measured using pH-dependent quenching of CF fluorescence as described (23Hill W.G. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30176-30185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Lande M.B. Priver N.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J.

Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow experiments were performed in which the liposomes were pretreated with 1 µm valinomycin and then rapidly mixed with an identical buffer acidified to pH 6.50. Valinomycin, which was used to collapse any potential difference arising as a result of proton influx, did not appear to be necessary, as permeability measurements performed in its absence did not alter the results. Buffer capacity was determined on an SLM-Aminco 500C spectrofluorometer by adding 10 mm acetate (final concentration) to liposomes as described (21Rivers R. Blanchard A. Eladari D. Leviel F. Paillard M. Podevin R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence data from the stopped-flow device were fit to a single exponential curve, and fitting parameters were used to solve the following equation forP H+, JH+=(PH+)(SA)(ΔC)=(ΔpH/t)(BCV)(Eq. 2) where J H+ is the flux of protons, ΔC is the initial difference in concentration of protons between the inside and the outside of the vesicle, ΔpH is the change in pH when time equals τ (the time constant of the single exponential curve describing the initial change in fluorescence as a function of time), and BCV is the buffer capacity of an individual vesicle. NH3 permeability was determined using stopped-flow fluorometry by monitoring the pH-sensitive increase in CF fluorescence when vesicles equilibrated to pH 6.8 were rapidly mixed with the same buffer containing 20 mm NH4Cl as described (21Rivers R. Blanchard A. Eladari D. Leviel F. Paillard M. Podevin R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lande M.B. Priver N.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J.

NH3, upon entry into the liposome interior, becomes protonated to NH4+ and thereby increases the liposomal pH. By combining values for the rate of change of intravesicular pH, the final intravesicular pH and the buffer capacity (assessed in the same way as for proton permeability),P NH3 was calculated (19Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The program SigmaStat (Jandel Corp., Corte Madera, CA) was used for Bonferroni t test, which allows for multiple comparisons. Differences in permeability values were considered significant when p < 0.05 was obtained. Fig.2 A shows representative averaged fluorescence tracings observed as liposomes shrank following their abrupt exposure to a doubling of external osmolality. For each curve, averaged data and fitted single exponential curves are shown. Fig. 2 B compiles the averages from determinations taken from several different preparations of liposomes to give mean ± S.E. of permeability values for each type of lipid as labeled. For the purposes of comparison, permeabilities of extracted lipids fromE. coli were also measured. Liposomes composed of E. coli polar lipids (4.9 ± 0.16 × 10−3 cm/s), Dph-PC (4.29 ± 0.30 × 10−3 cm/s), and polar lipids from H. salinarum composed entirely of archaeol lipids (3.88 ± 0.73 × 10−3 cm/s) showed comparable water permeabilities (Fig. 2 B). On the basis of these results, it appears that the shift from an ester to an ether linkage or the presence of methyl groups (Dph-PC versus E. coli lipids) does not have a major effect on the water permeability. Liposomes made of total polar lipids of M. jannaschii, which is mainly composed of macrocyclic archaeol and caldarchaeol lipids, showed reduced water permeability, 0.87 ± 0.040 × 10−3 cm/s, compared with the prior lipids. Similarly, liposomes made of caldarchaeol lipids (90% CP) from T. acidophilum also showed a marked reduction in water permeability, 0.66 ± 0.06 × 10−3 cm/s compared with the other lipids.E. coli lipids showed slightly higher permeability, and lipids of M. smithii (60% archaeol and 40% caldarchaeol) showed an intermediate permeability. Temperature dependence of water permeation is shown in Fig.3. In a plot of ln k versus 1/T, the slope of the curve is equal toEa/R, where Ea is the activation energy and R is the gas constant. Arrhenius activation energies of water permeation for various lipids are shown in TableI. The range of activation energy values seen in Table I shows a strong dependence of water permeability on temperature. Also shown are the estimated water permeability values at the optimal growth temperatures of the archaebacteria, calculated by extrapolation of data in Fig. 3.Table IActivation energyLipidsActivation energyEstimated permeability (P f)Kcal/molcm/sDph-PC12.10.060 at 60 °CE. coli lipids12.20.085 at 60 °CAs (H. salinarum)13.50.061 at 60 °CAM + C0 + As (M. jannaschii)15.60.030 at 65 °C1-aExtrapolated permeability at their optimal growth temperature assuming that the As and caldarchaeol lipids (no cyclopentane rings, C0) mainly constitute the permeability barrier for water in these archaea.CP (T. acidophilum)15.60.014 at 59 °C1-aExtrapolated permeability at their optimal growth temperature assuming that the As and caldarchaeol lipids (no cyclopentane rings, C0) mainly constitute the permeability barrier for water in these archaea.1-a Extrapolated permeability at their optimal growth temperature assuming that the As and caldarchaeol lipids (no cyclopentane rings, C0) mainly constitute the permeability barrier for water in these archaea. Open table in a new tab Liposomes were preloaded with 200 mm glycerol or urea as a permeant solute, and the efflux of the solute under isoosmotic conditions was measured by a decrease in CF fluorescence. Figs. 4 A and5 A show that the efflux of glycerol and urea was relatively rapid in liposomes composed ofE. coli phospholipids, Dph-PC, and archaeols, whereas the flux was extremely slow in liposomes composed of macrocyclic archaeols and/or caldarchaeol lipids. Permeability to both glycerol and urea was comparable for liposomes composed of Dph-PC or archaeols, and liposomes made of E. coli lipids showed a slightly more enhanced permeability. A drastic reduction in permeability was seen in liposomes made of macrocyclic archaeol and/or caldarchaeol lipids (Figs. 4 B and 5 B). Urea permeability was reduced by more than 70-fold compared with Dph-PC liposomes, and glycerol permeability was reduced by ∼120-fold.Figure 5Glycerol permeability of liposomes.

B, coefficient of glycerol permeability, calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig.6 A shows the internal acidification of liposomes after exposure to an acidic external buffer as monitored by entrapped CF. The permeability of archaeol liposomes (1.6 ± 0.46 × 10−4 cm/s) was approximately one-third that of Dph-PC (5.1 ± 1.3 × 10−4 cm/s), as seen in Fig. 6 B. The presence of caldarchaeol lipids further decreased the apparent proton permeability, as seen in liposomes composed of 60% archaeols and 40% caldarchaeols (0.41 ± 0.12 × 10−4cm/s) and 90% caldarchaeol lipids (0.47 ± 0.10 × 10−4 cm/s). A similar reduction in permeability was seen with macrocyclic archaeol lipids (0.29 ± 0.11 5 × 10−4 cm/s). E. colilipids showed slightly higher apparent proton permeability (10.1 ± 1.5 × 10−4 cm/s). The presence of an ether rather than an ester bond and isoprenoid chains rather than unbranched chains seems to decrease the apparent proton permeability markedly. Upon entry into the liposome, gaseous ammonia is protonated and increases the internal pH, which is measured as an increase in fluorescence of entrapped CF. Fig.7 A shows the time course of ammonia entry into liposomes composed of various lipids. Fig.7 B shows that ammonia permeability of liposomes composed ofE. coli lipids (20 ± 1.0 × 10−2 cm/s), Dph-PC (24 ± 3.0 × 10−2 cm/s), and archaeols (23 ± 8.4 × 10−2 cm/s) was comparable. A marked reduction in ammonia permeability was observed in liposomes composed of 60% archaeol and 40% caldarchaeol (3.1 ± 1.3 × 10−2 cm/s), macrocyclic archaeol lipids (3.8 ± 0.8 × 10−2 cm/s), and caldarchaeol lipids (2.4 ± 0.9 × 10−2 cm/s). There was an ∼6–10-fold reduction in ammonia permeability of macrocyclic archaeol and caldarchaeol lipids compared with that of Dph-PC. Water permeability and solute permeability across various membranes and model systems have been measured (14Komatsu H. Chong P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen.

Wiley Interscience, New York1987: 153-201Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanisms of its permeation are not well understood. The unique structural features of archaebacterial lipids allowed us to test the effects of presence of ester bond compared with ether bond, phytanyl chains compared with acyl chains, and the affects of restricted mobility of the phytanyl chain in macrocyclic lipids (AM and CP). Our results show that the water permeability is not affected by the presence of an ether bond instead of ester bond or isoprenoid chain instead of acyl chain, as E. coli lipids, Dph-PC, and archaeol lipids exhibited similar permeabilities (Fig. 2 B). Permeability studies of model bilayer systems indicate that the region of the acyl chain adjacent to the headgroup is the site likely to offer the most resistance for water and solute permeation (19Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 28Xiang T.X. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1108-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Xiang T.X. Chen X. Anderson B.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 78-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The midplane region of the bilayer formed by acyl chains farthest from the headgroup exhibit higher mobility (fluidity) and is thought to offer a reduced resistance to permeation. However, in macrocyclic archaeol lipids, in which the mobility of the distal aliphatic chain might be restricted due to linkage of terminal carbon atoms within the same lipid molecule (Fig.1), the water permeability was reduced by ∼ 5-fold (Fig.2 B). Similar results (∼6.5-fold reduction) were also seen in monolayer liposomes of caldarchaeol lipids with restricted midplane mobility (Figs. 1 and 2 B). Water diffusion is satisfactorily described by the “mobile kink” hypothesis, which assumes that the rapidly diffusing small pockets of free volume carry the permeant across the membrane. This hypothesis requires the formation of gauche-trans-gauche kinks and their propagation by fast lateral diffusion of lipids (30Haines T.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A large reduction in water permeability was shown in DPPC lipids in gel state compared with liquid crystalline state (26Hill W.G. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Carruthers A. Melchior D.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5797-5807Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 32Jansen M. Blume A.

J. 1997; 72: 223-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and is thought to be due to reduced number of gauche conformers in gel state. It has also been shown that rigidification of the outer leaflet of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes with the rare earth metal praeseodymium causes a significant reduction of water and solute permeabilities (26Hill W.G. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The lateral diffusion of the main polar caldarchaeol lipid of T. acidophilum at 30 °C, 5 × 10−9 cm2/s is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of phospholipids in liquid crystalline phase, which are typically around 10−7cm2/s (34Jarrell H.C. Zukotynski K.A. Sprott G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1369: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recent fluorescence studies in giant liposomes formed from caldarchaeol lipids of thermoacidophilic archaebacteriumS. acidocaldarius also showed that the lipids are rigid and tightly packed (35Bagatolli L. Gratton E. Khan T.K. Chong P.L. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 416-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is difficult to imagine the formation of g-t-g kinks in biphytanyl chains of a tetraether lipid that is tethered at both ends and that contains branched methyl groups and cyclopentane rings. These results, taken together with our permeability data, suggest that the reduced water permeability might be due to the low probability of occurrence of a rapidly diffusing kink given the tight lipid packing of caldarchaeol lipids. Water permeability shows strong temperature dependence in model membrane systems and cells lacking water channels (31Carruthers A. Melchior D.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5797-5807Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because the optimal growth temperatures for T. acidophilum and M. jannaschii are in the range of 55–79 °C, the water permeability was calculated for caldarchaeol and macrocyclic archaeol-rich lipids at optimal growth temperatures, by extrapolation of the measured permeability data of Fig. 3. The calculatedP f values were found to be in the range of 0.014–0.030 cm/s (see Table I). These values are remarkably close to that reported for native cell membranes expressing water channels such as erythrocytes (0.022 cm/s) and AQP2 containing endosomes (0.016 cm/s) (36Lande M.B. Jo I. Zeidel M.L. Somers M. Harris Jr., H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5552-5557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37Mathai J.C. Mori S. Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Mohandas N. Collins M. van Zijl P.C. Zeidel M.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1309-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A BLAST search of archaebacterial genomic data base revealed the presence of putative water channels in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and Archaeoglobus fulgidus that have optimal growth temperatures of 65 and 83 °C, respectively. Because the calculated basal permeability values of the archaeal lipids at these growth temperatures show very high water permeability (more than that of native mammalian membranes with water channels), it is reasonable to speculate that these putative aquaporins in the thermophilic archaea may be involved in transport of other solutes, rather than only water. Solute permeability across macrocyclic archaeol and caldarchaeol lipids was also markedly reduced, by 70–120-fold for urea and glycerol compared with Dph-PC (Figs. 4 B and 5 B). A significant reduction in urea and glycerol permeability was also shown in phosphatidylcholine liposomes containing sphingomylein and cholesterol (23Hill W.G. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30176-30185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is known that permeabilities of biological membranes and model lipid bilayers depend strongly on the degree of packing of lipid chains in the membrane (19Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 38Xiang T.X. Anderson B.D. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2658-2671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the size of the permeating solute (39Xiang T.X. Anderson B.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 40Walter A. Gutknecht J. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Membranes that are highly ordered show very low permeability and exhibit a steep dependence on size of the solute (23Hill W.G. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30176-30185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38Xiang T.X. Anderson B.D. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2658-2671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 41Stein W.D. Transport and Diffusion across Cell Membranes. Academic Press, Orlando1986Google Scholar). The gas ammonia is known to rapidly diffuse across cell membranes. Rigidification of the outer leaflet of the bilayer was shown to cause a significant decrease in ammonia permeability (26Hill W.G. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 6 B) suggest that the rigid packing of lipids causes a significant reduction in ammonia permeability of ∼ 6–10-fold in liposomes made of either macrocyclic archaeol lipids or caldarchaeol lipids. The observation that the fold reduction of ammonia permeability is similar to that of water (∼6–8-fold) suggests that the rate-limiting steps for permeation of both water and ammonia might be similar. Apparent proton permeabilities have been studied in various model systems, and yet the mechanisms of permeation are not well understood. The proton permeability was only weakly influenced by fluidity of the bilayer (19Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 42Paula S. Volkov A.G. Van Hoek A.N. Haines T.H. Deamer D.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 339-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). By contrast, rigidification of the outer leaflet of the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes by the rare earth metal praeseodymium led to a significant decrease in apparent proton permeability (26Hill W.G. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These apparently anomalous results suggest that proton flux occurs by a mechanism distinct from that of water and solute. The apparent proton permeability data in Fig. 6 Bshow that unlike water and solute permeability, a ∼3-fold reduction in permeability is seen in archaeol liposomes compared with Dph-PC. It has been suggested that protons move as hydrogen-bonded clusters of water molecules (water wires) dissolved in the hydrophobic core of the membrane (43Deamer D.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 457-479PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that presence of an ether bond, the oxygen of which lacks a lone pair of electrons, might disrupt the hydrogen-bonding network, leading to a barrier for proton diffusion in that region. Low proton permeability and sodium permeability at high salt concentrations were also shown in liposomes made of archaeol lipids from the extreme halophile H. salinarum and haloalkalophile Halorubrum vacuolatum (44van de Vossenberg J.L. Driessen A.J. Grant W.D. Konings W.N. Extremophiles. 1999; 3: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 6 B show a further reduction in proton permeability of 10–17-fold in macrocyclic archaeol and caldarchaeol lipids compared with Dph-PC lipids. Caldarchaeol lipids from thermoacidophilic archaeonS. acidocaldarius showed reduced proton permeability compared with archaeol lipids from the mesophilic E. coli or thermophilic Bacillus stearothermophilus (8Elferink M.G. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Komatsuet al. (14Komatsu H. Chong P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) reported proton permeability values in the range of 10−8 cm/s for caldarchaeol liposomes composed of polar lipid fraction E from S. acidocaldarius. Various proton permeability values have been reported in the literature from 10−4 to 10−9 cm/s for proton permeability based on the experimental conditions chosen. Small pH gradient leads to permeability values in the range of 10−4 cm/s (45Nichols J.W. Deamer D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2038-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and a large pH gradient leads to permeability values in the range of 10−9 cm/s. These extremely low permeability coefficients have been hypothesized to occur as a result of formation of diffusion potentials (46Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4324-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The apparent proton permeability measurement in this study employed well established methods using a small pH gradient of 0.5 pH unit (19Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 26Hill W.G. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 47Deamer D.W. Nichols J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The presence of sugar headgroups on these lipids may have an effect on solute and ion permeability, but the magnitude of the effects observed cannot be explained merely by the presence of sugar groups. Negative membrane surface charge was shown not be a factor for proton permeation in egg phosphatidylglycerol liposomes (14Komatsu H. Chong P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our proton permeability data are consistent with a tightly packed bilayer, which could reduce the occurrence of proton wires and thereby further decrease the proton permeability. However, the mechanism of proton permeation is not clearly understood. The low proton permeability and ion impermeability of the membrane are important features in the bioenergetics of the archaebacteria, considering that ATP synthesis is driven by proton/ion gradients (48Schafer G. Engelhard M. Muller V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 570-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that need to be maintained at extremes of external pH conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2004199183,"Full activation of protein kinase B (PKB, also called Akt) requires phosphorylation on two regulatory sites, Thr-308 in the activation loop and Ser-473 in the hydrophobic C-terminal regulatory domain (numbering for PKB alpha/Akt-1). Although 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) has now been identified as the Thr-308 kinase, the mechanism of the Ser-473 phosphorylation remains controversial. As a step to further characterize the Ser-473 kinase, we examined the effects of a range of protein kinase inhibitors on the activation and phosphorylation of PKB. We found that staurosporine, a broad-specificity kinase inhibitor and inducer of cell apoptosis, attenuated PKB activation exclusively through the inhibition of Thr-308 phosphorylation, with Ser-473 phosphorylation unaffected. The increase in Thr-308 phosphorylation because of overexpression of PDK1 was also inhibited by staurosporine. We further show that staurosporine (CGP 39360) potently inhibited PDK1 activity in vitro with an IC(50) of approximately 0.22 microm. These data indicate that agonist-induced phosphorylation of Ser-473 of PKB is independent of PDK1 or PKB activity and occurs through a distinct Ser-473 kinase that is not inhibited by staurosporine. Moreover, our results suggest that inhibition of PKB signaling is involved in the proapoptotic action of staurosporine."
https://openalex.org/W2067826437,"The Menkes protein is a transmembrane copper translocating P-type ATPase. Mutations in the Menkes gene that affect the function of the Menkes protein may cause Menkes disease in humans, which is associated with severe systemic copper deficiency. The catalytic mechanism of the Menkes protein, including the formation of transient acylphosphate, is poorly understood. We transfected and overexpressed wild-type and targeted mutant Menkes protein in yeast and investigated its transient acyl phosphorylation. We demonstrated that the Menkes protein is transiently phosphorylated by ATP in a copper-specific and copper-dependent manner and appears to undergo conformational changes in accordance with the classical P-type ATPase model. Our data suggest that the catalytic cycle of the Menkes protein begins with the binding of copper to high affinity binding sites in the transmembrane channel, followed by ATP binding and transient phosphorylation. We propose that putative copper-binding sites at the N-terminal domain of the Menkes protein are important as sensors of low concentrations of copper but are not essential for the overall catalytic activity. The Menkes protein is a transmembrane copper translocating P-type ATPase. Mutations in the Menkes gene that affect the function of the Menkes protein may cause Menkes disease in humans, which is associated with severe systemic copper deficiency. The catalytic mechanism of the Menkes protein, including the formation of transient acylphosphate, is poorly understood. We transfected and overexpressed wild-type and targeted mutant Menkes protein in yeast and investigated its transient acyl phosphorylation. We demonstrated that the Menkes protein is transiently phosphorylated by ATP in a copper-specific and copper-dependent manner and appears to undergo conformational changes in accordance with the classical P-type ATPase model. Our data suggest that the catalytic cycle of the Menkes protein begins with the binding of copper to high affinity binding sites in the transmembrane channel, followed by ATP binding and transient phosphorylation. We propose that putative copper-binding sites at the N-terminal domain of the Menkes protein are important as sensors of low concentrations of copper but are not essential for the overall catalytic activity. Menkes Wilson metal-binding site bathocuproinedisulfonic acid Chinese hamster ovary wild-type MNK with the conserved hinge domain mutated 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid Copper is an essential trace element: its ability to redox cycle between Cu(I) and Cu(II) states is utilized by cuproenzymes participating in redox reactions. However, these same properties make excess copper toxic to biological systems (1Linder M.C. Goode C.A. Frieden E. Biochemistry of the Elements. Plenum Press, New York1991: 331-342Google Scholar). Finely tuned complex mechanisms of copper homeostasis have evolved to allow the regulated uptake of copper, its delivery to target proteins, and detoxification by chelation and/or efflux from the cell (2Rensing C.

Copper-translocating P-type ATPases found in a variety of organisms are implicated in the delivery of copper to some cuproenzymes and in the efflux of copper from the cell (2Rensing C. Ghosh M.

Mutations in the Menkes gene that cause the loss of function of the MNK protein result in Menkes disease in humans, a potentially lethal X-linked disorder associated with severe systemic copper deficiency. Menkes patients suffer from neurological and connective tissue abnormalities as a result of copper deficiency, which reduces the activity of copper-dependent enzymes (9Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.V. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). Through clinical and laboratory studies on Menkes disease patients, the role of the MNK protein in the absorption of dietary copper from gut epithelium, delivery of copper to cuproenzymes, and efflux from the cell were established (9Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.V. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar, 10Camakaris J. Petris M.J. Bailey L. Shen P. Lockhart P.

Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 12Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle of P-type ATPases is characterized by the coupled reactions of cation translocation and ATP hydrolysis with a transient aspartyl phosphate formed as a part of the reaction cycle. The phosphorylation results in the enzyme changing its conformation from the high affinity cation and nucleotide binding state, E1, to the low affinity, E2, state. This transition coincides with cation translocation from the cytosolic to the lumenal side of the membrane. The release of the cation is followed by the hydrolysis of the aspartyl phosphate bond, and the return of the enzyme to the E1 state. Fig. 1shows a proposed model for the reaction cycle of MNK based on the model proposed for classical P-type ATPases (13Carafoli E. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 14MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). The E1-P conformation is also characterized as ADP-sensitive because the enzyme can be dephosphorylated by ADP (reverse reaction), whereas the E2-P state is ADP-insensitive (13Carafoli E. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 14MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol.

Investigating the properties of transient aspartyl phosphate provided important structure-function information on the catalytic mechanism of P-type ATPases.Although H+, Na+/K+ and Ca2+ P-type ATPases have been studied extensively (15Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), copper P-type ATPases have been discovered relatively recently (16Solioz M. Odermatt A. Krapf R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the mechanism of catalysis is still poorly understood. Thus, even the hallmark of P-type ATPases, the formation of the acylphosphate intermediate, has not been assessed in detail. Apart from eight highly conserved domains, the structure of human copper P-type ATPases differs considerably from other enzymes of that family (17Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The most prominent feature of human Menkes protein and the related Wilson (WND) protein, a copper P-type ATPase expressed in the liver, is six repeats of the putative metal-binding motifs (GMXCXXC) at the N-terminal domain (5Mercer J.F. Livingston J. Hall B. Paynter J.A. Begy C. Chandrasekharappa S. Lockhart P. Grimes A. Bhave M. Siemieniak D. Glover T.W. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Copper binding properties of the putative metal-binding sites (MBSs) of human copper P-type ATPases have been a major focus of studies on the structure of these enzymes. Several reports have established a stoichiometrical binding of Cu(I) to the N terminus of MNK and WND (18Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,19DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, the copper exchange between this domain and a cytosolic copper chaperone, ATOX1, has been demonstrated in vitro (20Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). At least some of the MBSs appear to be involved in regulation of copper-stimulated trafficking of MNK, which is believed to be essential for copper absorption into the body and copper detoxification (22Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Goodyer I.D. Jones E.E. Monaco A.P. Francis M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, despite these findings, the role of MBSs in the catalysis of copper translocation, the pivotal function of MNK, is yet to be fully understood.The observation that functional complementation of the yeast copper P-type ATPase, Ccc2, can be provided by the MNK and WND proteins has become the basis for an indirect assay. The Δccc2 yeast cannot grow in copper/iron-depleted medium, as in the absence of the Ccc2 protein, copper cannot be delivered and incorporated into cuproenzyme Fet3, the function of which is essential for high affinity iron uptake. The expression of MNK or WND complements the growth of Δccc2 yeast through, presumably, high affinity copper transport (24Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore, any MNK or WND mutant unable to complement the Δccc2 phenotype has been considered inactive. The analysis of various MNK or WND mutants suggested that at least some MBSs were essential for the complementation of the yeast copper transport system and were thus presumed to be involved in the catalysis of copper translocation (25Yuan D.S.

In contrast to these reports, we have demonstrated directly using an in vitro vesicle64Cu translocation assay and in vivo whole cell64Cu accumulation assays that the MBSs of MNK are not essential for 64Cu translocating activity of the MNK protein in mammalian cells (28Voskoboinik I.

Through these studies, we examined the role of putative MBSs in catalysis, and we propose that their role is high affinity copper sensing/activation of the MNK protein.RESULTSThe wild-type and mutant MNK proteins were expressed stably and at a relatively high level in yeast. A similar content of the wild-type and mutant MNK protein in membrane vesicles (Fig.2) provided a significant advantage in terms of the use of yeast over the mammalian expression system, in which the expression of MNK mutants used in the present study was unstable and variable despite the constant selection with an antibiotic G418 (22Strausak D.

The MNK protein expressed in yeast had a smaller apparent molecular weight than MNK expressed in CHO cells from the same cDNA construct (Fig. 2). The protein was not truncated, as the Western immunoblotting analysis detected both yeast and CHO cells expressed MNK using anti-MNK antibodies raised against the C terminus and the N terminus of the protein (data not shown). A similar observation has been reported previously and may be due to an altered posttranslational modification(s), such as hypoglycosylation, of MNK (26Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Figure 2Western immunoblotting analysis of the Menkes protein expressed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeyeast and cultured CHO cells.

The Δccc2 phenotype was complemented by wtMNK and mMBS1–3 as indicated by the growth of yeast on the copper/iron-deficient medium (Fig.3). The Δccc2complementation was independent of the level of expression of wtMNK, as two clones of yeast expressing significantly different levels of wtMNK (Fig. 2) both complemented the growth of Δccc2 yeast (Ref. 27Forbes J.R.

As predicted, the D1044E and mHD mutants, which lacked essential catalytic domains, as well as the empty vector control, could not complement the growth of Δccc2 yeast (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The mutation of all six MBSs (mMBS1–6) resulted in the loss of Δccc2complementation by MNK (Fig. 3).Figure 3Δccc2 complementation assay in yeast.

The wtMNK protein was phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP on wet ice (0 + 2 °C) in a time-dependent manner with the maximum phosphorylation occurring within 20 s. (Fig.5A). A labeling longer than 20 s resulted in irreversible acylphosphate-independent phosphorylation of MNK. 2I. Voskoboinik, J. Mar, D. Strausak, and J. Camakaris, unpublished observations. In the presence of a copper chelator, 1 mm BCS, there was no significant phosphorylation observed, suggesting that copper was essential for the formation of acylphosphate (Figs. 5 A and6). Hydrolysis of the [32P]MNK complex with 100 mm hydroxylamine is consistent with the acylphosphate nature of the intermediate (Fig.5 A). “Pulse-chase” of MNK acylphosphate with 1 mm “cold” ATP demonstrated the transient nature of the phosphorylated intermediate, with almost a complete turnover of MNK being observed by 60 s (Fig. 5, D and E). The formation of MNK acylphosphate was reversible in the presence of 1 mm ADP or 1 mm BCS, as indicated by rapid dephosphorylation of the [32P]wtMNK complex (Fig.7). The results suggested that, by analogy with other P-type ATPases, under the experimental conditions, at least 70% of the phosphorylated MNK protein was present in the ADP-sensitive E1-like state, as ∼30% phosphorylated intermediate remained phosphorylated following pulse-chase with ADP (Figs. 1 and7 B). Presumably, the latter represents the E2-P ADP-insensitive state of MNK. As expected for a P-type ATPase, orthovanadate inhibited the phosphorylation of MNK. However, at least 200 µm of the inhibitor was required to inhibit the formation of acylphosphate significantly (Fig. 5 A).Figure 5The formation of transient acylphosphate from [γ-32P]ATP by the MNK protein and its mutants (see under “Experimental Procedures”).

The lack of phosphorylation of the mHD mutant indicated that the alteration of the conserved motif within the ATP-binding loop probably prevented the ATP binding and consequently resulted in the inability of the mutant to be acyl-phosphorylated (data not shown) and transport 64Cu (Fig. 4).The formation of acylphosphate was copper concentration-dependent, with the maximum level of phosphorylation observed at 5 µm copper (Fig. 6). A further increase in copper concentration resulted in the inhibition of phosphorylation, due, most likely, to substrate inhibition and/or protein denaturation. This is in agreement with the 64Cu translocation vesicle assay, in which the transport of 64Cu could not be measured at >∼5–6 µm copper (27Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicated the heterologously expressed human wtMNK in yeast was a fully active copper pump that had all the features characteristic of a P-type ATPase and was essentially indistinguishable from MNK expressed in mammalian cells. The formation of wtMNK acylphosphate intermediate appeared to be copper-specific, as no detectable phosphorylation was observed in the presence of other heavy metals, such as cadmium, zinc, and mercury (Fig. 5 F).The MNK mutant with the first three N-terminal MBSs mutated (mMBS1–3) remained catalytically active with respect to 64Cu translocation, although its activity was reduced by 40–50% compared with wtMNK (Fig. 4). The apparent kinetics parameters for mMBS1–3 wereK m = 4.0 ± 0.7 µm copper andV max = 0.37 ± 0.03 nmol of copper/min/mg of protein, and with respect to ATP, K m = 13 ± 4 µm ATP (±S.E.), similar to the wtMNK (see above). The mutant protein formed transient aspartyl phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP and turned over in the presence of 1 mm ATP identically to wtMNK (Fig. 5, D andE).The substitution of Cys to Ser in all six MBSs of MNK resulted in the mutant mMBS1–6, which had no detectable 64Cu-translocating activity under the assay conditions (1–5 µm64Cu). Because of the inhibitory effect of copper (see above), we were unable to test whether the mMBS1–6 mutant could transport 64Cu at concentrations >5 µmcopper. However, the mutant protein was transiently phosphorylated in a copper-specific and copper concentration-dependent manner and was turning over, as judged by the pulse-chase experiment in the presence of 1 mm ATP, in a fashion similar to the wtMNK and mMBS1–3 proteins (Fig. 5, B, D, E, and F). The phosphorylation of mMBS1–6 also appeared to be reversible in the presence of ADP or BCS (Fig. 7).In order to clarify the role of MBSs in catalysis and to understand potential reasons for apparently conflicting results between phosphorylation assays suggesting that the mMBS1–6 mutant is catalytically active, and the lack of 64Cu-translocating activity and Δccc2 complementation (Fig. 3), we attempted to simulate the conditions of the yeast growth assay in vitro, i.e. severe copper limitation. Thus, the phosphorylation assay was conducted in the presence of copper to stimulate the phosphorylation, but copper was rendered unavailable by increasing concentrations of the copper chelator BCS, which is commonly added to yeast growth medium in order to conduct the Δccc2assay. The results of this experiment indicated that the phosphorylation of mMBS1–6 was up to 2-fold lower than wtMNK in the presence of BCS (Fig. 8). This was consistent with a faster rate of dephosphorylation of mMBS1–6 than wtMNK in the presence of BCS (Fig. 7 A), suggesting that the mutant copper transporter had a lower affinity for copper than the wild-type MNK protein.Figure 8Inhibition of phosphorylation of wtMNK and mMBS1–6 by the copper chelator BCS. Labeling with [γ-32P]ATP was conducted for 20 s. The level of phosphorylation in the absence of BCS was normalized to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Importantly, orthovanadate, a common inhibitor for P-type ATPases (40O'Neal S.G. Rhoads D.B. Racker E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), appeared to be a more potent inhibitor of the phosphorylation of mMBS1–6 than wtMNK (Fig. 9). Orthovanadate is a structural homologue of orthophosphate that binds to the invariant Asp1044 residue of MNK in the ADP-insensitive E2 state (see Fig. 1). Therefore, in the absence of high affinity copper-binding sites in mMBS1–6, a relatively higher proportion of the mutant appears to be present in the E2-like conformation (Fig.7 B), which can be more susceptible to the orthovanadate inhibition, as documented for other P-type ATPases.Figure 9The inhibition of phosphorylation of wtMNK and mMBS1–6 by sodium orthovanadate. Membrane vesicles were preincubated with orthovanadate for 5 min on ice. The labeling with [γ-32P]ATP was conducted for 20 s.

However, the mutant was unable to complement the Δccc2 phenotype in yeast (Fig. 10 B) and could not transport 64Cu in the vesicle transport assay (Fig. 10 C).

That suggests the Tx-MNK mutation in the putative transmembrane domain 8 of MNK affected high affinity copper binding, potentially within the cation channel, that prevented the mutant MNK from acquiring the putative high affinity ATP binding conformation.Figure 10The effect of M1393V (Tx-MNK) mutation on the activity of MNK.

The α chains of laminins have been shown to have various biological activities. In this study, we identified a sequence of the α3 chain C-terminal globular domain (LG1-LG5 modules) required for both heparin binding and cell adhesion using recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides. We found that the LG3 and LG4 modules have activity for heparin binding and that LG4 has activity for cell adhesion. Studies with synthetic peptides delineated the A3G75aR sequence (NSFMALYLSKGR, residues 1412–1423) within LG4 as a major site for both heparin and cell binding. Substitution mutations in LG4 and A3G75aR identified the Lys and Arg of the A3G75aR sequence as critical for these activities. Cell adhesion to LG4 and A3G75aR was inhibited by heparitinase I treatment of cells, suggesting that cell binding to the A3G75aR site was mediated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We showed by affinity chromatography that syndecan-2 from fibroblasts bound to LG4. Solid-phase assays confirmed that syndecan-2 interacted with the A3G75aR peptide sequence. Stably transfected 293T cells with expression vectors for syndecan-2 and -4, but not glypican-1, specifically adhered to LG4 and A3G75aR. These results indicate that the A3G75aR sequence within the laminin α3 LG4 module is responsible for cell adhesion and suggest that syndecan-2 and -4 mediate this activity.

Three chains are assembled into a cross-shaped heterotrimer (αβγ) by forming a triple-stranded coiled-coil structure through the α-helical domain of each chain (6Utani A. Nomizu M. Timpl R.

In cultured keratinocytes, laminin-5 is secreted in an unprocessed form containing a 200-kDa α3 chain, a 140-kDa β3 chain, and a 155-kDa γ2 chain and then processed into a mature form containing of a 165-kDa α3 chain, a 140-kDa β3 chain, and a 105-kDa γ2 chain (20Marinkovich M.P.

The unprocessed laminin α3 chain (200 kDa) was found in cell layers of the provisional edge of the cell sheet in cultured keratinocytes. In vivo, the unprocessed α3 chain has been identified especially in the newly synthesized epidermal basement membrane in wounds (18, 31; for review, see Ref. 33Nguyen B.P. Ryan M.C. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, the biological function of the C terminus globular modules of the α3 chain is unknown. In the present work, we used recombinant proteins to discover that the LG4 module of the laminin α3 chain has activity for heparin binding and cell adhesion. We delineated this activity to the sequence NSFMALYLSKGR by mutation analyses with recombinant LG4 and synthetic peptides. We demonstrated with affinity chromatography and DNA transfection assays that syndecan-2 and -4 are responsible for LG4-mediated cell adhesion. Anti-human syndecan-2 antibody (l-18) and human syndecan-4 antibody (N-19) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. FITC1-conjugated anti-heparan sulfate monoclonal antibody 10E4 and anti-neo-heparan sulfate antibody 3G10 were obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan. FITC-conjugated mouse IgM, k monoclonal immunoglobulin standard (anti-TNP) was from PharMingen. For Western blotting and solid-phase assays, biotinylated anti-human IgG and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Moss Inc., Pasadena, MD) were used. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Sigma) was used for solid-phase assays for syndecan-2 binding. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG, anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for Western blotting of syndecans and glypican-1. Human neonatal dermal fibroblasts were obtained form Asahi Techno Glass Co., Tokyo, Japan. The HaCat human keratinocyte cell line was a kind gift of Dr. Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). 293T cells were derived from 293 cells as a highly transformed human renal epithelial line expressing two viral oncogenes, adenovirus E1a and SV40 large T antigen (34Numa F. Hirabayashi K. Tsunaga N. Kato H. O'Rourke K. Shao H. Stechmann-Lebakken C. Varani J. Rapraeger A. Dixit V.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4676-4680PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. cDNA was synthesized using mRNA from human fibroblasts and HaCat cells by the Superscript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) and amplified by the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). A DNA sequence for the 27-amino acid signal peptide of the laminin γ2 chain was inserted into the XhoI and NheI-BamHI sites of the MO90 vector, which expresses the human IgG Fc portion under the EF1-α promoter (35Zettlmeissl G. Gregersen J.P. Duport J.M. Mehdi S. Reiner G. Seed B. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). cDNA for the LG modules of the human laminin α3 chain (GenBankTML34155) was amplified and cut byAvrII and cloned into the NheI site of the above vector. The expression vector encodes a recombinant protein with the γ2 signal peptide, a laminin α3 LG module, and IgG Fc. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a thermo sequenase Cy5 dye terminator and ALF express II DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primers for RT-PCR were as follows: LG1–5 (2,344–5,139 nt of the laminin α3 chain), 5′-GAGCCTAGGCCGACTGCCAAATGACCTGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGCCTAGGCCCTGGTCAGGACAACCATTCAG-3′ (backward); LG1–2 (2,344–3,438 nt, forward), same as the forward primer of LG1–5; backward, 5′-GAGCCTAGGACCTTCCAGTCTTCCGAG-3′; LG3 (3,421–4,083 nt), 5′-GAGCCTAGGGTCGGAAGACTGGAAGCTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGCCTAGGGCCTGGGTCTTGGGAAGTGGT-3′ (backward); LG4 (4,042–4,611 nt), 5′-GAGCCTAGGAAGGTGTGGCAAGATGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGCCTAGGTTCTCCAAAGGACCACCCAAG-3′ (backward); LG5 (4,574–5,139 nt), 5′-GAGCCTAGGTTCTTCAAGCTTTCGGGGTGTCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGCCTAGGCCCTGGTCAGGACAACCATTCAG-3′ (backward). For γ2-s (GenBankTM accession number 9845499, 84–1924 nt, the N-terminal 611 amino acids of the γ2 chain), RT-PCR product from HaCat cell mRNA was cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites located 5′ of the human IgG Fc sequence in the MO90 vector. The primers used are: 5′-GAGCTCGAGACCGCCATGCCTGCGCTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGGATCCGAGCAAGCTGGACAGCTGAATG-3′ (backward). Primers for the signal peptide of the human laminin γ2 chain (84–170 nt, 27 amino acids): forward, same as the forward primer for γ2-s and backward, 5′-GGGATCCGTCGACGCTAGCACTTCCCTCCTGGAGGTGG-3′. Serine substitutions in LG4 were prepared by PCR-mediated mutagenesis with T4 DNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA ligase (Takara Shuzo, Co. Ltd., Shiga, Japan). Primers for PCR were as follows: LG4-SGR, 5′-GGACGTCTGGTCTTTGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGATGAAAGATAAAGAGCCATAAAG-3′ (backward); LG4-KGS, 5′-TCCCTGGTCTTTGCACTGGGGACA (forward) and 5′-TCCTTTTGAAAGATAAAGAGC-3′ (backward); LG4-SGS, 5′-GGATCCCTGGTCTTTGCACTGGGGACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGATGAAAGATAAAGAGCCATAAA-3′ (backward). Recombinant proteins were expressed in 293T cells by the Ca-P transfection kit (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). Conditioned media (CM) with 1.5% fetal bovine serum in DMEM were collected for 4 days at 12-h intervals. After addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture, including 7 µg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma), 2 µm leupeptin (Sigma), 10 mm benzamidine (Sigma), and 26 µg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), CM were frozen and kept at −80 °C until use. CM were precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by dialysis against PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), pH 7.4. The dialyzed samples were applied on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), PBS and 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The bound materials were eluted with 0.1 m acetic acid and neutralized by 1 m Tris-HCl, then concentrated with Centricon YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The protein concentration was calculated by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Purity of proteins was determined by reducing 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. After transfection, CM were collected, and 1 ml of CM was adjusted to 0.40 m NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with 60 µl of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The bound materials were eluted with SDS buffer for Western blotting after rinsing four times with 1 ml of 0.40 m NaCl, phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.5% Triton X-100. In protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography, 60 µl of protein A-Sepharose was mixed with 1.0 ml of CM. Competition assays were performed by incubation with various amounts of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), including heparin, chondroitin sulfate A, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant proteins, GST-LG4-N (N-terminal 101 amino acids), and 83 amino acids of C-terminal LG4 were expressed as a GST fusion protein using the pGEX-5T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Bugbuster protein extraction kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to manufacture's protocols. The primers for PCR were as follows: GST-LG4-N (4,063–4,365 nt), 5′-GAGGAATTCTCACCACTTCCCAAGACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGGTCGACTTAATCATGGCCAAACACAC-3′ (backward). The amounts of the fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose were calculated with the BCA protein assay kit after elution with 10 mm glutathione (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. All peptides of the laminin α3LG4 were manually synthesized by the Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-based solid-phase methods with a C-terminal amide as described previously (6Utani A. Nomizu M. Timpl R. Roller P.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19167-19175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac 5C18 column and a gradient of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purity of the peptides was confirmed by analytical high performance liquid chromatography. Identity of the peptides was confirmed by a Sciex API IIIE triple quadrupole ion spray mass spectrometer. Heparin-albumin (Sigma) was coated on Nunclon surface 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and air-dried overnight. The amount of heparin-albumin was changed from 0 to 200 ng/well to obtain saturation curve and 2 ng/well of heparin-albumin was used as coated substrates for LG4 binding assays. After a 4-h block at room temperature with blocking buffer (10% nonfat dry milk, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20), purified recombinant proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking in 50 µl of blocking buffer containing 0.40 m NaCl. After rinse with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, the wells were incubated with biotinylated anti-human IgG (×2,000), followed by the incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (×5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound recombinant proteins were detected with alkaline phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate using a microplate reader at A 405 nm (Toyo Soda, Tokyo, Japan). Background OD without heparin coating was subtracted from each OD value. For competition assays using synthetic peptides, 200 µg/ml amounts of each peptide and 0.5 µg/ml of LG4 were mixed during incubation on wells coated with heparin-albumin (2.0 ng/well). Substrates used were BM165 affinity-purified processed laminin-5, which does not contain the LG4–5 modules (kindly provided from Dr. Amano, Shiseido Co., Tokyo, Japan) (36Amano S. Scott I.C.

Surface 96-well plates were coated with substrates in distilled water overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with water, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) in DMEM for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were trypsinized and recovered in 10% fetal bovine serum, DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere followed by three rinses with 10 ml of 0.1% BSA, DMEM. After rinsing, 100 µl of the cell suspension (2 × 105/ml) in 0.1% BSA, DMEM was plated on the wells for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The wells were rinsed once with PBS and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% methanol (v/v) for 10 min. The attached cells were counted in three randomly selected fields (×200). For competition assays, cells were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with synthetic peptides or heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate C, and hyaluronate (Seikagaku Kogyo). Enzyme treatment was performed as described previously (26Hoffman M.P. Nomizu M. Roque E. Lee S. Jung D.W. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol.

Then, cells were collected as described above in the presence of cycloheximide. Cells were incubated with 50 milliunits/ml heparitinase I (Seikagaku Kogyo) for 90 min at 37 °C, with mixing every 15 min, followed by adhesion assays as described above. Early confluent dermal fibroblasts from three 75-cm2 flasks were rinsed with PBS and scraped into 10 ml of PBS with a cell scraper and centrifuged, resuspended in 50 µl of DMEM, and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence or absence of heparitinase I (50 milliunits/ml). The cells were lysed with 30 µl of lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, PBS in the presence of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture) for 60 min on ice with occasional vortexing. The lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were boiled in SDS buffer and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-syndecan-2 antibody (1:500) (Santa Cruz) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Sigma) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For affinity chromatography with recombinant fusion proteins, cells were scraped into PBS, washed, and lysed with lysis buffer as described above. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants (20 mg/ml) were frozen at −80 °C until use. The supernatant (80 µl) was diluted with 500 µl of 0.40 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated with 3.0 µg of GST-LG4-N or GST protein overnight at 4 °C. The bound materials were eluted with 10 mm glutathione, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by dialysis against distilled water. Heparan sulfate chains were removed by treatment with heparitinase I (1 milliunit/ml, 5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0) at 42 °C for 30 min twice. Western blotting was performed as described above after lyophilization of the samples. cDNA for the entire coding region of human syndecan-2 (GenBankTMaccession number J04621), human syndecan-4 (GenBankTMaccession number X67016), and human glypican-1 (GenBankTMaccession number MN_002081) were amplified using mRNA from dermal fibroblasts with the following primers: syndecan-2 (577–1,245 nt), 5′-GAGCCTAGGTCCCTGGGGAATATGCGGCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGCCTAGGTTACGCATAAAACTCCTTAGT-3′ (backward); syndecan-4 (9–623 nt), 5′-GAGCCTAGGTCTCCAGTCCGCGGTGCCATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGGAATTCTCACGCGTAGAACTCATTGG-3′ (backward); glypican-1 (122–1,901 nt), 5′-GAGTCTAGAGGACCTTGGCTCTGCCCTTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGGAATTCTTACCGCCACCGGGGCCTGGCTAC-3′ (backward). PCR products were sequenced and cloned into an expression vector containing a cytomegalovirus promoter, IRES (37Jackson R.J. Howell M.T. Kaminski A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 477-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and a puromycin-resistant gene (38Lacalle R.A. Pulido D. Vara J. Zalacain M. Jimenez A.

BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and clones expressing syndecan-2, syndecan-4, or glypican-1 were selected with 0.4 µg/ml of puromycin (Sigma). Expression of syndecans in the selected clones was confirmed by both Western blotting and immunofluorescence study. For Western blotting of syndecan-2 and -4 expressed in 293T cells, the cell lysates were prepared as described above except for 20 passes through a 21-gauge needle before lysis on ice. The supernatants (20 mg/ml) were boiled for 10 min in 6 m urea/40 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 100 µl was applied to DEAE-cellulofine (Seikagaku Kogyo). After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS, the bound materials were eluted with 1.0 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS and dialyzed against water at 4 °C. Heparitinase I digestion was performed as above, and Western blotting was done with anti-syndecan-2 and -4 antibodies (1:500). For Western blotting of glypican-1 and syndecan-2 overexpressed in 293T cells, heparitinase I treatment of intact cells was also performed before lysis as described above. Glypican-1 was probed with anti-neo-heparan sulfate monoclonal antibody 3G10 (0.2 µg/ml). For immunocytochemistry of syndecans and glypican-1, cells expressing syndecan-2, syndecan-4, or glypican-1 or parental 293T cells were placed on a cover glass for 24 h and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 15 min at room temperature, blocked with 5% normal donkey serum (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA), 1% BSA, PBS for 15 min, and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-heparan-sulfate monoclonal antibody 10E4 (20 µg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. FITC-conjugated mouse IgM, k monoclonal immunoglobulin standard (anti-TNP) (PharMingen), was used as a negative control and showed no staining (data not shown). The pictures were taken by Nikon fluorescent microscopy. Cell lysates (20 mg/ml) were obtained from the 293T syndecan-2-expressing clone syn-2-#3. 500 µl was used for GST-LG4N affinity chromatography, and the bound materials were eluted and digested with heparitinase I. Syndecan-2 was probed with anti-syndecan-2 antibody as described above. For solid-phase assay, 5 µl of cell lysates/well was used as a source of syndecan-2. The bound syndeca-2 was detected as described above. The expression vectors for the C-terminal G domain modules, LG1–5, LG1–2, LG3, LG4, and LG5, were transfected into 293T cells and recombinant proteins secreted in the CM were purified by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Purified LG1–2, LG4, and LG5 showed a single band in SDS-PAGE with the predicted molecular mass (Fig. 1 A). LG1–5 and LG3 showed several bands with the largest corresponding for the predicted molecular size, while the smaller bands were partially degraded products (Fig. 1 A). LG1–5, LG3, and LG4 bound heparin in heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, whereas LG1–2 and LG5 did not (Fig. 1 B). Heparin binding activity of LG3 and LG4 was observed even in the presence of 0.40 m NaCl during affinity chromatography, indicating a strong interaction with heparin. We next examined specificity of heparin binding of LG4 by inhibition assays using various glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as competitors (Fig.1 C). Increasing amounts of heparin inhibited LG4 binding to a heparin-Sepharose affinity column, but chondroitin sulfate A, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid failed to inhibit. Binding of LG4 to heparin was also examined by solid-phase assays (Fig.1 D). The LG4 binding was dose-dependent and half-maximal binding was achieved at 0.5 µg/ml (∼8 nm). To delineate the active sequence within LG4 for heparin binding (Fig.1 E), overlapped synthetic peptides covering the entire sequence of LG4 were prepared (Table I). Competition assays with synthetic peptides demonstrated that peptide A3G75 efficiently blocked LG4 binding to heparin. These data indicated that the A3G75 sequence in the LG4 module was essential for heparin binding.Table ISynthetic peptidesPeptideSequencePeptideSequenceA3G67ASPRSVKVWQDAA3G78DGKKLRIKSKEKA3G68SPLPKTQANHGAA3G79NGDKWHTVVFGHA3G69NHGALQFGDIPTA3G80VFGHDGEKGRLVA3G70DIPTSHLLFKLPA3G81GRLVVDGLRAREA3G71FKLPQELLKPRSA3G82RAREGSLPGNSTA3G72KPRSQFAVDMQTA3G83GNSTISIRAPVYA3G73DMQTTSSRGLVFA3G84IRAPVYLGSPPSGKA3G74RG"

We have characterized the ligand binding activity of SdrG, a fibrinogen-binding microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules from S. epidermidis. Western ligand blot analysis showed that a recombinant form of the N-terminal A region of SdrG bound to the native Bβ chain of fibrinogen (Fg) and to a recombinant form of the Bβ chain expressed in Escherichia coli. By analyzing recombinant truncates and synthetic peptide mimetics of the Fg Bβ chain, the binding site for SdrG was localized to residues 6–20 of this polypeptide. Recombinant SdrG bound to a synthetic 25-amino acid peptide (β1–25) representing the N terminus of the Fg Bβ chain with a K D of 1.4 × 10−7m as determined by fluorescence polarization experiments. This was similar to the apparentK D (0.9 × 10−7m) calculated from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay where SdrG bound immobilized Fg in a concentration-dependent manner. SdrG could recognize fibrinopeptide B (residues 1–14), but with a substantially lower affinity than that observed for SdrG binding to synthetic peptides β1–25 and β6–20. However, SdrG does not bind to thrombin-digested Fg. Thus, SdrG appears to target the thrombin cleavage site in the Fg Bβ chain. In fact, SdrG was found to inhibit thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting by interfering with fibrinopeptide B release.

Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common pathogenic species of coagulase-negative staphylococci and accounts for 74–92% of the infections caused by this group of staphylococci (1Garrett D.O. Jochimsen E. Murfitt K. Hill B. McAllister S. Nelson P. Spera R.V. Sall R.K. Tenover F.C. Johnston J. Zimmer B. Jarvis W.R. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 1999; 20: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The molecular pathogenesis of most infections is complex and involves multiple microbial factors and host components but is generally initiated by the adherence of the microbe to host tissues. Bacterial adherence involves specific surface components called adhesins. Bacterial pathogens, such as staphylococci that live in the extracellular space of the host, target extracellular matrix components, including fibrinogen (Fg)1 and fibronectin, for adherence and colonization. This process is mediated by a subfamily of adhesins that have been termed microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs)1 (2Patti J.M. Höök M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Staphylococcus aureus expresses multiple MSCRAMMs, of which several have been characterized in some detail (for a recent review see Ref. 3Foster T.J. Höök M. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 484-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In addition to S. epidermidis, S. aureus also causes serious foreign body infections. S. aureus appears to adhere to the biomaterial through an indirect mechanism. Upon implantation, the foreign body rapidly becomes coated with host proteins derived primarily from plasma with Fg being a dominant component. S. aureus appears to adhere to the absorbed proteins rather than to the biomaterial itself using adhesins of the MSCRAMM family (4Galliani S. Viot M. Cremieux A. Van der Auwera P. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar, 5Vaudaux P. Pittet D. Haeberli A. Huggler E. Nydegger U.E. Lew D.P. Waldvogel F.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1989; 160: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). At least four of the S. aureusMSCRAMMs recognize Fg. Two of these MSCRAMMs, ClfA and ClfB (clumping factors A and B), have Fg-binding A regions followed by a long segment of Ser-Asp (SD) dipeptide repeats. The other two Fg-binding MSCRAMMs contain a similar ligand-binding A region followed by a fibronectin-binding motif that is repeated five times (6Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Because the fibronectin binding activity was identified first, these two MSCRAMMs are known as FnbpA and FnbpB (fibronectin-binding proteins A and B) (7Flock J.I. Fröman G. Jonsson K. Guss B.

Studies have demonstrated the importance of ClfA and ClfB in the adherence of S. aureus to plasma-coated biomaterials.S. aureus mutants deficient in one or both of these MSCRAMMs exhibited an impaired ability to adhere to plasma-coated cathetersin vivo or ex vivo (9Nı́ Eidhin D.

Albrecht R.M. Lew D.P. Wabers H. Cooper S.L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 585-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For S. epidermidis, adherence to foreign bodies could involve both specific and nonspecific processes. The bacteria may initially associate directly with the foreign body through nonspecific interactions, whereas the later stages of adherence may involve more specific interactions between bacterial adhesins and host ligands.S. epidermidis expresses polysaccharide adhesins including polysaccharide adhesin and polysaccharide intercellular adhesin, which are encoded by the ica locus (11McKenney D. Hubner J. Muller E. Wang Y. Goldmann D.A. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4711-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cramton S.E. Gerke C. Schnell N.F. Nichols W.W. Götz F. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5427-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we (13McCrea K.W. Hartford O. Davis S., Nı́ Eidhin D. Lina G. Speziale P. Foster T.J. Höök M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and others (14Nilsson M. Frykberg L. Flock J.I. Pei L. Lindberg M. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2666-2673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown that S. epidermidiscontains surface proteins structurally related to S. aureusMSCRAMMs. Two of these S. epidermidis proteins, called SdrF and SdrG (serine-aspartate repeat proteins F and G), have features typical of Gram-positive bacterial proteins that are anchored to the cell wall. Both proteins show significant amino acid sequence homology to ClfA and ClfB from S. aureus including an ∼500-amino acid-long A region, a SD dipeptide repeat region, and features required for cell wall anchoring, including a LPXTG motif (see Fig.1A). Recent studies by Pei et al. (15Pei L. Palma M. Nilsson M. Guss B. Flock J.I. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4525-4530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that one of these S. epidermidis proteins, SdrG (also called Fbe), can bind Fg and specifically recognizes the Bβ chain of this molecule. In the current study, we have localized the SdrG-binding site in the Fg Bβ chain to the N-terminal segment of this polypeptide, proximal to the thrombin cleavage site. In fact, we have demonstrated that SdrG inhibits thrombin-induced fibrin clot formation by interfering with the release of fibrinopeptide B. Escherichia coli strain JM101 was used for plasmid cloning. E. colistrain Topp3 (Stratagene) was used for protein expression. Strains harboring plasmids were grown in Lennox L broth (Sigma) or on Lennox L agar (Sigma) supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin. The gene fragment encoding the entire A region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using S. epidermidisK28 genomic DNA as a template. The oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-CCCGGATCCGAGGAGAATACAGTACAAGACG-3′ and 5′-CCCGGTACCGATTTTTTCAGGAGGCAAGTCACC-3′. The restriction enzyme cleavage sites (underlined) BamHI and KpnI were incorporated into the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The reactions were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermocycler. The reactions contained 50 ng of template DNA, 100 pmol of forward and reverse primers, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mmMgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm of each dNTP, and 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Amplification was performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min for 25 cycles. The amplifiedsdrG fragment was digested with BamHI andKpnI and ligated into the expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen Inc.) that had been digested with the same enzymes, yielding the construct pSdrG (50). The recombinant protein rSdrG (50) expressed from this plasmid contains a N-terminal extension of six histidine residues (His tag). E. coli transformed with pSdrG (50) was grown for ∼2 h for the cultures to give anA 600 of 0.6. rSdrG (50) expression was induced by the addition of 225 µmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 3 h. The bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.5 (140 mm NaCl, 270 µm KCl, 430 µm Na2HPO4, 147 µmKH2PO4) and frozen overnight at −20 °C. Bacterial cells were thawed and mechanically lysed by using a French pressure cell (SLM Amnico). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and filtration through a 0.45-µm filter membrane. The supernatant containing the recombinant protein was applied to a Ni2+-charged (87.5 mm) 5-ml Hi Trap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was equilibrated with buffer A (0.1m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) before the application of the filtered lysate. The column was then washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with a continuous linear gradient of imidazole (5 -120 mm; total volume, 160 ml) in buffer A. Fractions were monitored for protein by determining the absorbance at 280 nm, and fractions containing rSdrG (50) were identified by SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). These fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.5. The dialyzed protein was then applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The bound protein was eluted with a continuous linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 mm; total volume, 160 ml) in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the purified rSdrG (50) were identified by determining the absorbance at 280 nm and by SDS-PAGE. The truncated A region of ClfA was purified as previously reported (17McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The synthetic Fg peptides β1–25, β1–25S, β1–20, and β6–25 were custom ordered from Research Genetics, and the FpA and FpB (fibrinopeptides A and B) were from Bachem. Peptides β6–20 and β11–20 were synthesized in our laboratory using a multiple peptide synthesizer by Advanced Chemtech. For the following peptides the residue numbers are given and the sequence follows (residue 1 corresponds to the first residue of the mature Bβ chain): peptide β1–25, composed of the first 25 amino acid residues of the N terminus of the Bβ chain of Fg (QGVNDNEEGFFSARGHRPLDKKREE); peptide β1–20 (QGVNDNEEGFFSARGHRPLD); peptide β6–25 (NEEGFFSARGHRPLDKKREE); peptide β1–25S, a scrambled version of peptide β1–25 (FSERKDLHQGEGNPREFVENDAKGR); peptide β6–20 (NEEGFFSARGHRPLD); peptide β11–20 (FSARGHRPLD); FpA (ADSEGEGDFLAEGGGVR); and FpB (QGVNDNEEGFFSAR). Peptides were purified by HPLC and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Microtiter plates (Immulon 4, Dynatech Laboratories Inc.) were coated with 1 µg of Fg (Enzyme Research Labs) in PBS, pH 7.5, for 18 h at 4 °C. The plates were washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with PBST and rSdrG (50), diluted into PBS, and added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with PBST and bound rSdrG (50) was detected by adding a 1:2000 dilution of an anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) in PBST, 0.1% BSA. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times with PBST. A 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated polyclonal antibodies (Bio-Rad) in PBST, 0.1% BSA were added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with PBST and developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in 1 m diethanolamine, 0.5 mmMgCl2, pH 9.0, at room temperature for ∼30 min. The plates were read at 405 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Thermomax microplate reader, Molecular Devices). In the inhibition experiments, 50 nm rSdrG (50) in PBS was preincubated with the indicated amounts of selected peptides for 1 h at room temperature. The sample mixtures were added to the Fg-coated wells, and bound rSdrG (50) was detected as described above. For the ELISA with thrombin-digested Fg, the plate was coated with Fg and blocked as described above. The plate was washed three times with PBST, and 50 µl of 1.0 NIH unit/ml of thrombin was added to the Fg-coated wells. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The plate was washed three times with PBST, and 50 µl of 1.0 NIH unit/ml of hirudin (Sigma) was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The plate was washed three times with PBST and blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBST, 100 µl of biotin labeled rSdrG (50) (25–1000 nm) or a rSdrG (50)/hiudin (1.0 NIH unit/ml) mixture was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed three times with PBST and a 1:5000 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugated (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in PBST, 0.1% BSA was added to the wells for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed three times with PBST and developed as described above. An E. coli strain harboring plasmid p668, which contains the cDNA for the Fg Bβ chain, was kindly provided by Dr. Susan T. Lord (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The 1525-base pair fragment from p668 was subcloned into the plasmid pQE30 to produce recombinant mature Bβ chain with a N-terminal His tag. Additional Bβ chain constructs (see Fig. 3A) were made by subcloning into either pQE30 or pGEX-KG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce recombinant proteins with a N-terminal His tag or glutathioneS-transferase fusion. Whole E. colilysates harboring each respective Fg Bβ chain construct were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane with a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated overnight with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS, pH 7.5, at 4 °C to saturate nonspecific binding sites. After blocking, the membrane was washed three times with PBST and then incubated with biotin labeled rSdrG (50) (0.5 µm) for 1 h at room temperature. rSdrG (50) was biotin labeled using EZ Link-sulfo-NHS-LC biotin (Sigma) according to the manufacturers' instructions. After three more washes with PBST, the blot was incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugated for 1 h at room temperature and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Bio-Rad) in carbonate:bicarbonate buffer (14 mmNa2CO3, 36 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm MgCl2:6H2O, pH 9.8) for ∼15 min at room temperature. Fluorescence polarization was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) for the interaction of rSdrG (50) with peptide β1–25. The peptide was labeled with fluorescein as described previously (18O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of rSdrG (50) in PBS, pH 7.5, were incubated with 10 nm labeled peptide for 3 h in the dark at room temperature. The reactions were allowed to reach equilibrium. Polarization measurements were taken with a Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B using FL WinLab software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression used to fit a binding function as defined by the following equation. ΔP=ΔPmax·[protein]KD+[protein](Eq. 1) where ΔP corresponds to the change in fluorescence polarization, ΔP max is the maximum change in fluorescence, and K D is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the interaction. A single binding site was assumed in this analysis. 150 µl of a 3.0 µm Fg solution was incubated with 10 µl of rSdrG (50) or BSA (1.0–6.0 µm) and 50 µl of thrombin (Sigma) (1.0 NIH unit/ml) in microtiter wells at room temperature. Clot formation was monitored by measuring the increase in A 405 over time and expressed as A 405/min (mOD/min). A plate reader (Thermomax microplate reader, SOFTmax software, Molecular Devices) was used to monitor absorbance. Using the kinetic mode with one wavelength (L1 = 405 nm), the samples were read every 10 s for 5 min. In this assay, 1.0 NIH unit/ml of thrombin incubated with 3.0 µm Fg produced a fibrin clot in 5 min at room temperature. The thrombin catalyzed release of fibrinopeptides A and B was analyzed as follows. Fg solutions were diluted to 0.3 µm in 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmε-aminocapriotic acid, and 1.0 mm CaCl2. ε-Aminocapriotic acid was included to inhibit any possible plasmin contaminant activity. Thrombin was added to a final concentration of 0.05 NIH units/ml. rSdrG (50) was added to a final concentration of 0.3, 0.6, or 1.5 µm. The tubes were mixed by inversion, and 500-µl aliquots were removed for the 15- and 60-min time points. The aliquots were incubated at room temperature and then immersed in boiling water for 15 min to halt the reaction. The aliquots were stored on ice for the remainder of the time course. At the end of the reaction the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were removed and stored at −20 °C overnight prior to analysis by high performance liquid chromatography. The fibrinopeptides released were monitored by reverse phase HPLC essentially as described (19Mullin J.L. Gorkun O.V. Binnie C.G. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25239-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The samples were loaded onto a Waters Delta-Pak C18 column equilibrated with buffer A (25 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.0). Fibrinopeptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 100% buffer A to 40% buffer B (buffer A with 50% acetonitrile) and monitored by absorbance at 205 nm. Fibrinopeptide peak area was determined using the software Waters Millennium32. To characterize the ligand binding activity of SdrG, a recombinant form of the putative ligand-binding A region (residues 50–597) (Fig.1 C) was expressed in E. coli with a N-terminal His tag. This protein construct, rSdrG (50), was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography. The purity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis, where it migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ∼97 kDa (Fig. 1 B). This is larger than the theoretical molecular mass of 63.7 kDa predicted from the primary amino acid sequence of this protein. Analysis of rSdrG (50) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry indicated a molecular mass of 63.3 kDa. Aberrant migration in SDS-PAGE has also been observed with recombinant MSCRAMMs derived from S. aureus and may be explained by the hydrophilic nature of these proteins (9Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 13McCrea K.W. Hartford O. Davis S., Nı́ Eidhin D. Lina G. Speziale P. Foster T.J. Höök M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). SdrG is closely related to the recently described fibrinogen binding MSCRAMM Fbe (15Pei L. Palma M. Nilsson M. Guss B. Flock J.I. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4525-4530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially examined the ligand binding specificity of SdrG for Fg in an ELISA. In this assay, rSdrG (50) bound immobilized Fg but failed to bind to other immobilized extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, collagen types I and IV, vitronectin, laminin, and thrombospondin (data not shown). Binding of increasing concentrations of rSdrG (50) to absorbed Fg exhibited saturation kinetics (Fig.2). Together these observations demonstrate the specificity of the SdrG-Fg interaction. Furthermore, biotin-labeled rSdrG (50) recognized the Bβ chain but not the Aα or γ chains of Fg when analyzed by Western ligand blotting (data not shown). The observation that rSdrG binds the Fg Bβ chain fractionated under reducing and denaturing conditions in Western ligand blot analysis suggests that the MSCRAMM recognizes a specific linear amino acid sequence in the Bβ chain. To explore this possibility and locate the SdrG-binding site, a recombinant mature Fg Bβ chain and a series of truncated forms of the Bβ chain expressed in E. coli were analyzed by Western ligand blot. The recombinant Bβ chain constructs were expressed as either His tag or glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins (Fig.3 A). The fractionated proteins were transferred to a supporting membrane and probed with biotin labeled rSdrG (50) (Fig. 3 B). rSdrG (50) recognized the mature recombinant Bβ chain (residues 1–462) as well as the recombinant truncates encompassing residues 1–341, 1–220, 1–195, and 1–95. However, rSdrG (50) failed to bind to the two recombinant truncates that lacked the N-terminal 25 amino acid residues of the Bβ chain, rβ (25–95) and rβ (25) (Fig.3 B). These observations demonstrate that rSdrG (50) recognizes a linear sequence in Fg and suggests that this site lies within the N-terminal region of the Bβ chain. To further define the rSdrG (50) binding site in the Fg Bβ chain, we used a peptide mimetic approach. A series of peptides representing segments of the N-terminal region of the Fg Bβ chain were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of rSdrG (50) to Fg in an ELISA (Fig.4). In Fig. 4 A, peptides β1–25 and β6–25 were shown to inhibit the binding of rSdrG (50) to Fg in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the scrambled version of β1–25, peptide β1–25S, did not interfere with the binding of rSdrG (50) to Fg. Effective inhibition of rSdrG (50) binding to Fg was also observed with peptide β6–20 and, to a somewhat lesser degree, with β1–20. Peptide β11–20 was essentially inactive in this assay (Fig.4 B). The thrombin cleavage sites in Fg lie between residues 14 (Arg) and 15 (Gly) in the Bβ chain and between 16 (Arg) and 17 (Gly) in the Aα chain. Upon cleavage of Fg by thrombin the fibrinopeptides FpA and FpB are sequentially released. The fibrinopeptides were examined as inhibitors of rSdrG (50) binding to Fg in an ELISA. FpB inhibited the binding of rSdrG (50) in a concentration-dependent manner, but this peptide was at least 10-fold less active than the synthetic peptide β1–25 (Fig. 4 C). FpA was essentially inactive and behaved similarly to the scrambled peptide β1–25S. Taken together, this suggest that rSdrG (50) recognizes a linear amino acid sequence in the Bβ chain located within residues 6–20. This recognition site appears to overlap the thrombin cleavage site in this polypeptide. The rSdrG-binding site seems to lie within close proximity to the thrombin cleavage site; therefore, we investigated whether rSdrG (50) could bind to Fg in which the thrombin cleavage site was abolished. Fg-coated microtiter wells were pretreated with thrombin or thrombin plus hirudin (which inhibits thrombin activity) to remove FpB and destroy the cleavage site. The ability of rSdrG (50) to bind to this thrombin-digested Fg was significantly impaired (Fig. 5), suggesting that the thrombin cleavage site residues Bβ Arg14 and Gly15 and residues within FpB (1–14) are essential for rSdrG (50) to bind Fg. An equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) for the interaction of rSdrG (50) with the Fg Bβ chain peptide β1–25 was determined. By analyzing the binding of increasing concentrations of rSdrG (50) to the fluorescein-labeled β1–25 peptide in a fluorescence polarization assay, rSdrG (50) binding to the labeled peptide exhibited saturation kinetics with a K D of 1.4 ± 0.01 × 10−7m (Fig.6A). To demonstrate the specificity of this interaction, the binding of rSdrG (50) to the labeled β1–25 peptide was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled peptide (β1–25) or scrambled peptide (β1–25S). The unlabeled β1–25 peptide but not peptide β1–25S inhibited binding of rSdrG (50) to the fluorescein-labeled β1–25 peptide, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.6 B). The apparent K D determined for the binding of rSdrG (50) to the fluorescein-labeled peptide β1–25 is similar to the apparent K D (0.9 × 10−7m) for the interaction of rSdrG (50) with immobilized, intact Fg as determined by ELISA (Fig. 2). In the final stages of the blood coagulation cascade, thrombin cleaves Fg releasing the fibrinopeptides and producing fibrin monomers. These fibrin monomers then polymerize to form a fibrin clot (20Herrick S. Blanc-Brude O. Gray A. Laurent G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The localization of the SdrG-binding site described above raises the possibility that rSdrG (50) may be able to inhibit thrombin-induced fibrin clot formation, perhaps by directly competing with thrombin for binding to the N terminus of the Bβ chain of Fg or by binding to a proximal site and sterically blocking the proteolytic attack of thrombin on the Bβ chain. To test this hypothesis, we designed a fibrin clot inhibition assay in which 3.0 µmFg, 0–6.0 µm rSdrG (50), and 1.0 NIH unit/ml of thrombin were incubated, and the formation of a fibrin clot was monitored by measuring the increase in optical density at 405 nm. Fig.7shows that rSdrG (50) inhibited fibrin clot formation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas BSA had no effect. This suggests that rSdrG (50) can interfere with thrombin activity by binding to a site in the Fg Bβ chain that is proximal to or overlaps the binding site for thrombin. The release of FpA and FpB from the N terminus of the Aα and Bβ chains of Fg by thrombin can be monitored and quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography (19Mullin J.L. Gorkun O.V.

We examined the effect of rSdrG (50) on fibrinopeptide release by measuring the peak areas of FpA and FpB, as detected by HPLC. The HPLC chromatograms shown in Fig.8show the expected fibrinopeptide release following digestion of Fg with thrombin superimposed with the fibrinopeptide release when Fg and thrombin are incubated with rSdrG (50). A significant decrease in the amount of FpB release was shown with a 1:1 ratio of rSdrG (50) to Fg (TableI), whereas a 5:1 ratio was effectively able to inhibit the release of FpB (Fig. 8). This effect was seen at incubation times of 15 and 60 min. There was no apparent interference of FpA release by rSdrG (50).Table IPercentage of FpB released in the presence of SdrGSdrG:Fg15 min60 min0:11001001:165.445.22:113.917.45:1<0.001<0.001Fg (0.3 µm) was incubated with SdrG and 0.5 NIH units/ml of thrombin at room temperature, and the samples were analyzed by HPLC. The amount of fibrinopeptide released was determined by measuring the area under the peaks on the HPLC chromatograms. The data were normalized to compare the data from separate chromatograms assuming that the release of FpA is not affected by the presence of SdrG. The peak area representing FpB in the absence of SdrG was set to 100%. Open table in a new tab Fg (0.3 µm) was incubated with SdrG and 0.5 NIH units/ml of thrombin at room temperature, and the samples were analyzed by HPLC. The amount of fibrinopeptide released was determined by measuring the area under the peaks on the HPLC chromatograms. The data were normalized to compare the data from separate chromatograms assuming that the release of FpA is not affected by the presence of SdrG. The peak area representing FpB in the absence of SdrG was set to 100%. In this study, we have shown that SdrG binds the N terminus of the Bβ chain of Fg with a high degree of specificity. The binding of SdrG to an N-terminal Fg peptide exhibits a K D of 1.4 × 10−7m, which is significantly lower than the K D determined for the binding of ClfA to a γ chain peptide (2.0 × 10−5m) (18O'Connell D.P.

Thus, SdrG appears to have a higher affinity for its respective synthetic Fg peptide target compared with the S. aureusMSCRAMM. The K D determined for the binding of SdrG to the synthetic peptide β1–25 is similar to the apparentK D estimated for the binding of SdrG to intact Fg absorbed onto microtiter wells. This observation suggests that the SdrG binding site in the synthetic peptide is presented in a nearly optimal form and that additional segments of Fg do not significantly contribute to the formation of the SdrG-binding site. Several studies have examined the role of Fg-binding MSCRAMMs fromS. aureus as virulence factors in animal models. Strains in which the genes encoding ClfA or ClfB have been inactivated are less virulent compared with the wild type strain in a rat model of catheter-induced endocarditis (23Moreillon P. Entenza J.M. Francioli P. McDevitt D. Foster T.J. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4738-4743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Entenza J.M. Foster T.J., Nı́ Eidhin D. Vaudaux P. Francioli P. Moreillon P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5443-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ClfA- and ClfB-mediated adherence is required for the maximum virulence potential of S. aureus to be expressed. ClfB has been shown to promote S. aureus adherence to ex vivohemodialysis tubing, further confirming that ClfB contributes to bacterial attachment to biomaterials coated with host proteins (9Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In a recent study, Stutzmann Meier et al. (25Stutzmann Meier P. Entenza J.M. Vaudaux P. Francioli P. Glauser M.P. Moreillon P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that heterologous expression of ClfA on Streptococcus gordonii, which is generally considered a nonvirulent bacterium, rendered this organism pathogenic in a rat endocarditis model. With the discovery that SdrG is a Fg-binding MSCRAMM expressed by S. epidermidis, the possibility arises that SdrG can act as a virulence factor in S. epidermidis-induced infections and plays a role similar to that of the Fg-binding MSCRAMMs in S. aureus-induced infections. We have mapped the binding site of rSdrG (50) in the Fg Bβ chain to a linear sequence in the N-terminal region of this polypeptide. Peptide β6–20 is a potent inhibitor of the binding of rSdrG (50) to Fg, whereas FpB (1–14) has poor inhibitory activity. Because peptide β6–20 but not β11–20 is recognized by this MSCRAMM, the N-terminal border of the binding site must lie between residues 6 and 11 of the Bβ chain. The observation that rSdrG (50) is unable to bind to thrombin-digested Fg, i.e.the fibrinopeptides are absent, suggests that the C terminus of this binding site is located between residues 14 and 20 of the Bβ chain. It is striking that many of the identified staphylococcal MSCRAMMs appear to specifically recognize Fg, although the sites targeted in Fg by these proteins vary. ClfA, FnbpA, and FnbpB of S. aureusall recognize the C terminus of the Fg γ chain (6Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E. Turner N. McIntire L. Foster T. Höök M. Eur. J.

Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and SdrG is here shown to bind to the N terminus of the Bβ chain. Thus, these MSCRAMMs use a conserved A region to bind different sites in Fg. Furthermore, the MSCRAMMs appear to target sites in Fg that are important in the molecular physiology of this key component of hemostasis. The C terminus of the γ chain is recognized by the platelet integrin αIIbβ3, and ClfA is a potent inhibitor of Fg-induced platelet aggregation (26Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. Chung D.W. Davie E.W.

Here, we show that the binding site in the Bβ chain for rSdrG (50) appears to overlap the thrombin cleavage site and that rSdrG (50) can interfere with fibrin clot formation by inhibiting the thrombin-induced release of FpB. Fg may play an important role in the host's defense against microbial infections, and interfering with this function gives the bacteria an advantage and the ability to survive in a hostile environment. One such potential advantage may be related to the observed chemotactic activity of FpB for human peripheral blood leukocytes (28Kay A.B. Pepper D.S. McKenzie R. Br. J. Haematol. 1974; 27: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Richardson D.L. Pepper D.S. Kay A.B. Br. J.

Invest. 1986; 77: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We have shown that rSdrG (50) can prevent the release of FpB; thus one can speculate that the reason S. epidermidis possesses a protein that can bind to this region of the Fg Bβ chain is to prevent the release of chemotactic elements. This may reduce the influx of phagocytic neutrophils and help to ensure the survival of the bacteria in the host. We thank Dr. Elisabeth Wann for advice. We are very grateful to Dr. Susan Lord for providing the E. coli strain harboring the plasmid with Fg Bβ chain cDNA."

In this study, we demonstrate that LARG is a functional Dbl protein. Expression of LARG in cells caused activation of the serum response factor, a known downstream target of Rho-mediated signaling pathways. Transient overexpression of LARG did not activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, suggesting LARG is not an activator of Ras, Rac, or Cdc42. We performed in vitro exchange assays where the isolated Dbl homology (DH) or DH/pleckstrin homology domains of LARG functioned as a strong activator of RhoA, but exhibited no activity toward Rac1 or Cdc42. We found that LARG could complex with RhoA, but not Rac or Cdc42, in vitro, and that expression of LARG caused an increase in the levels of the activated GTP-bound form of RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42, in vivo. Thus, we conclude that LARG is a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Finally, like activated RhoA, we determined that LARG cooperated with activated Raf-1 to transform NIH3T3 cells.

Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To date, at least 18 human Rho GTPases have been identified, with RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 being the most widely studied and characterized (2Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J.

Rho proteins are molecular switches that are active and transduce downstream signals when they are bound to GTP and are inactive when bound to GDP. Dbl proteins activate Rho proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP bound to Rho and are selective toward specific Rho family members (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways regulated by Rho proteins control cell cycle progression, transcription, and actin cytoskeletal arrangement. Hence, it is not surprising that the aberrant activation of Rho GTPases has been shown to promote the uncontrolled growth as well as the invasive and metastatic properties of tumor cells (2Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 3Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). All Dbl family proteins contain a tandem Dbl homology (DH) domain/pleckstrin homology (PH) domain structure (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The DH domain is the catalytic region of the protein, whereas the PH domain regulates the DH domain as well as the subcellular localization of the Dbl protein (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S.

Whereas some DH domains act as GEFs for specific Rho GTPases, others show broad activity and can cause activation of multiple Rho GTPases. For example, Vav can act as a GEF for RhoA, RhoG, Rac1, and Cdc42 (5Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell.

For a number of Dbl family proteins, activation of transforming activity was a result of either amino-terminal (Dbl, Vav, Ect2, etc.) (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim.

Although some of these screens involved the analyses of DNA from tumor cell lines, the rearrangements that led to activation of transforming activity were due to artifacts of the transfection procedure. One Dbl family protein, BCR, is rearranged in the leukemia-associated BCR-Abl translocation gene product (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, the transforming function of this oncoprotein has been attributed to the Abl tyrosine kinase portion rather than the rearranged BCR sequences (17Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, to date, no Dbl family protein has been found to be aberrantly activated in human cancers. LARG is a Dbl family member that was identified as a fusion partner with MLL in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (18Kourlas P.J. Strout M.P. Becknell B. Veronese M.L. Croce C.M. Theil K.S. Krahe R. Ruutu T. Knuutila S. Bloomfield C.D. Caligiuri M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2145-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition to a DH and a PH domain, LARG contains a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) box, suggesting that it may bind and function as a GTPase-activating protein toward α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (19Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 20Siderovski D.P. Strockbine B. Behe C.I. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

The presence of the RGS domain also suggests that LARG may link G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling with Rho GTPases. p115-RhoGEF also contains an RGS box, and Gα13 association with this domain promotes p115-RhoGEF activation of RhoA (21Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). LARG also contains a PDZ domain that is likely involved in protein-protein interactions (22Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Since the catalytic activity of Dbl proteins can be activated by amino-terminal truncation, the putative exchange activity of LARG may be altered in the MLL-LARG fusion, where the amino-terminal end of LARG is deleted. Consequently, as Rho proteins are known to regulate cellular growth and transformation it, is possible that deregulation of these proteins by mutations in Dbl family proteins plays a role in carcinogenesis. Since not all Dbl family proteins are functional GEFs, whether LARG is an activator of a specific Rho GTPase(s) and whether LARG exhibits growth-promoting activity has not been determined. In this study, we determined that LARG is a specific activator of RhoA, and not Rac1 or Cdc42, in cells and that overexpression of LARG can promote growth transformation. These observations suggest that aberrant LARG and RhoA function may contribute to the development of AML. A human prostate cDNA library (CLONTECH) clone containing the entire 4635-base pair LARG open reading frame was modified to includeBamHI restriction sites at 5′ and 3′ ends by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Expand PCR system, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The modified cDNA was cloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced completely. A truncatedLARG cDNA representing nucleotides 925–4635 in the published sequence (GenBank™ accession no. NM_015313) was generated and encodes the portion of LARG retained in theMLL-LARG chimeric gene identified (designated ΔN308 LARG) (18Kourlas P.J. Strout M.P. Becknell B. Veronese M.L. Croce C.M. Theil K.S. Krahe R. Ruutu T. Knuutila S. Bloomfield C.D. Caligiuri M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2145-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This cDNA was modified by PCR to include flanking BamHI sites. The LARG cDNA was further truncated to include nucleotides 2263–4635 in the published sequence and encodes an amino-terminal truncated protein that lacks essentially all sequences upstream of the DH/PH domains (designated ΔN754 LARG). This cDNA was modified by PCR to include flankingBamHI sites. Following complete sequencing, the cDNAs for LARG, ΔN308 LARG, and ΔN754 LARG were cloned into theBamHI site of the pCGN-hyg eukaryotic expression vector, which is a derivative of pCGN (23Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). This provided the attachment of an amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag to the amino terminus of each LARG protein. These cDNAs were also cloned into theBamHI site of pZBE-HA (a gift from Adrienne D. Cox, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC), a derivative of the pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 eukaryotic expression vector (24Cepko C.L. Roberts B.E. Mulligan R.C.

The pET-28a bacterial expression constructs encoding the LARG DH domain and the LARG DH/PH domains were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 22 °C. The recombinant proteins were His6-tagged at their carboxyl terminus and were purified from bacterial lysate on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) (33Self A.J. Hall A.

Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GDP incorporation into GDP-preloaded Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, RhoG, RhoE, and TC10 was carried out using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 B Spectrometer at 20 °C essentially as described (36Abe K.

Exchange reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 400 nm mant-GDP (Biomol), and 2 µm GTPase were prepared and allowed to equilibrate with continuous stirring. After equilibration (300 s), each LARG or Vav2 polypeptide was added to 100 nm, and the relative mant fluorescence (λex = 360 nm, λem = 440 nm) was monitored. All experiments were performed in duplicate. A 70% confluent 100 mm dish of NIH3T3 cells was transfected with pCGN-ΔN754LARG by using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were lysed with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for two min and split into four aliquots (250 µg of protein/sample). Thirty µg of either bacterially expressed GST, GST-Cdc42(15A), GST-Rac1(15A), or GST-RhoA(17A) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to each sample. The samples were rotated at 4 °C for 45 min, and the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Affinity-precipitated proteins were eluted in protein sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies.

GST-PAK-RBD fusion protein was used to affinity-precipitate activated Rac1-GTP and Cdc42-GTP from cell lysates. Briefly, 7 h after transfection of 293T cells, these cells were placed in medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 10 min. GST-PAK and GST-rhotekin fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were incubated with 100–200 µg of cell lysates in a final volume of 0.5 ml for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in protein sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The following antibodies were used for Western blot analyses to verify expression of transfected genes: anti-HA (16B12, Covance Research Products), anti-Myc (9E10,Roche Molecular Biochemicals) anti-RhoA (sc-418), and anti-Cdc42 (sc-87) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology). LARG is a Dbl family protein that was identified as a fusion partner with MLL in a patient with AML (18Kourlas P.J. Strout M.P. Becknell B. Veronese M.L. Croce C.M. Theil K.S. Krahe R. Ruutu T.

LARG contains many previously identified functional domains including a PDZ domain (22Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem.

Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), as well as a putative nuclear localization signal (Fig.1 A). LARG resembles two other Dbl family members: p115RhoGEF/Lsc (10Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which has an RGS domain; and PDZ-RhoGEF (47Rumenapp U. Blomquist A. Schworer G. Schablowski H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) which has both a PDZ domain and an RGS domain. In order to characterize LARG function, we introduced the cDNA encoding LARG into the pCGN-hyg eukaryotic expression vector. This also facilitated the attachment of an HA epitope tag at the amino terminus of the protein. In addition, we also generated expression vectors encoding two amino-terminally truncated versions of LARG. ΔN308 LARG represents the portion of LARG still present in the AML-associated MLL-LARG fusion protein (18Kourlas P.J. Strout M.P. Becknell B. Veronese M.L. Croce C.M. Theil K.S. Krahe R. Ruutu T. Knuutila S. Bloomfield C.D. Caligiuri M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2145-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). ΔN754 LARG is similar to an activating deletion mutation of PDZ-RhoGEF (Fig. 1 A) (48Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Since LARG contains the DH/PH domain structures found in all members of the Dbl family of Rho protein activators (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we first investigated the ability of these LARG proteins to activate signaling pathways known to be stimulated by Rho GTPase activation (49Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, 50Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays, LARG activated the serum response factor (SRF) (52Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) as measured by a luciferase reporter gene that is only responsive to SRF activity (Fig. 1 B). RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have all been shown to activate SRF (49Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike our observations with BCR, another Dbl family member mutated in leukemias, where we failed to observe activation of SRF, 2G. W. Reuther and C. J. Der, unpublished observations. we did find that LARG can mediate signaling activities shared with Rho GTPases. Amino-terminal truncation of Dbl family members often results in constitutively activated mutants of these proteins (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, we were surprised to find that amino-terminal truncation did not enhance LARG-mediated SRF activity (Fig. 1 B). Unlike what has been observed with p115-RhoGEF (21Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and PDZ-RhoGEF (48Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), deletion of the RGS domain did not result in variants of LARG with enhanced signaling activity. These data also indicate that the ability of LARG to activate known Rho-responsive signaling pathways does not depend on functional PDZ or RGS domains. Activation of Rac1 and Cdc42, but not RhoA (50Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 51Coso O.A.

These kinases phosphorylate and activate the c-Jun transcription factor (53Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-104PubMed Google Scholar, 54Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine if LARG activates JNK, a Gal-Jun reporter system was utilized in which the Jun transactivation region is fused to a Gal4 DNA binding domain (26Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK leads to the phosphorylation of the transactivation domain leading to activation of the reporter. LARG was unable to activate Gal-Jun, suggesting Rac1 and Cdc42 are not downstream targets of LARG (Fig. 1 C). LARG also did not activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase, suggesting it is not an activator of Ras. 5G. W. Reuther, Q. T. Lambert, and C. J. Der, unpublished observations. These data suggest that LARG may target other Rho family members that are not upstream activators of JNK. We next used three approaches to evaluate the ability of LARG to interact with and activate specific Rho GTPases. First, we expressed recombinant protein corresponding to the isolated DH domain and the DH/PH domains of LARG and we performedin vitro exchange assays using bacterially expressed RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42.

To clarify the roles of the mycobacterial acyl carrier protein (AcpM) and MCAT in fatty acid and mycolic acid biosynthesis, we have cloned, expressed, and purified acpM andmtfabD (malonyl-CoA:AcpM transacylase) from M. tuberculosis. According to the culture conditions used, AcpM was produced in Escherichia coli in two or three different forms: apo-AcpM, holo-AcpM, and palmitoylated-AcpM, as revealed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The mtfabD gene encoding a putative MCAT was used to complement a thermosensitive E. coli fabD mutant. Expression and purification of mtFabD resulted in an active enzyme displaying strong MCAT activity in vitro. Enzymatic studies using different ACP substrates established that holo-AcpM constitutes the preferred substrate for mtFabD.

The relative impermeability of the mycobacterial cell wall contributes largely to the intrinsic resistance of the bacterium to these microbicidal factors (1Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). The cell wall is based on a conventional peptidoglycan, covalently linked to an arabinogalactan esterified with mycolic acids. Mycobacterial mycolic acids are high molecular weight (C60-C90) α-alkyl, β-hydroxy fatty acids and represent 40–60% by weight of the mycobacterial cell envelope (2Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Academic Press, New York1982: 95-184Google Scholar). Mycolic acids form the basis of a complex lipid bilayer outer membrane, which constitutes a permeability barrier of extremely low fluidity (3Liu J. Rosenberg E.Y. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Several components of the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway, such as enoyl-ACP reductase, have already been described as targets for important antitubercular drugs (5Quémard A. Sacchettini J.C.

Fatty acid biosynthesis in mycobacteria involves at least two different types of enzyme systems, fatty acid synthase (FAS)1 I and FAS-II (10Kremer L. Baulard A.R. Besra G.S. Hatfull G.F. Jacobs W.R. Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 173-190Google Scholar). FAS-I is a single polypeptide with multiple catalytic activities generating short-chain acyl CoA esters (11Kolattukudy P.E. Fernandes N.D. Azad A.K. Fitzmaurice A.M. Sirakova T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which then serve as precursors for elongation by other fatty acid and polyketide synthases (PKS). In contrast to FAS-I, FAS-II consists of dissociable enzyme components, which act upon a substrate bound to an acyl carrier protein (ACP), recently designated as AcpM in M. tuberculosis (12Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X. Mead D. Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). FAS-II is incapable of de novo fatty acid synthesis, but elongates myristoyl-AcpM and palmitoyl-AcpM to long chain fatty acids ranging from 24 to 56 carbons in length (10Kremer L. Baulard A.R. Besra G.S. Hatfull G.F. Jacobs W.R. Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 173-190Google Scholar). We have recently shown that mtFabH, a β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase, forms a pivotal link between the type I and type II FAS elongation systems in M. tuberculosis. Indeed, mtFabH uses lauroyl-CoA (C12) and myristoyl-CoA (C14) to generate myristoyl-AcpM (C14) and palmitoyl-AcpM (C16), respectively, the preferred substrates of the FAS-II system (13Choi K.H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28201-28207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase A (KasA) belongs to the FAS-II system and catalyzes the first reaction of the elongation step by condensing a two-carbon unit from malonate (malonyl-AcpM) to a pre-existing carbon chain esterified to the phosphopantetheine moiety of AcpM. 2L. Kremer and G. S. Besra, unpublished results.2L. Kremer and G. S. Besra, unpublished results. The reaction requires activated malonate in the form of malonyl-AcpM as a substrate. In bacteria, transacylation of holo-ACP with malonate involves malonyl-CoA and the enzyme malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (MCAT) encoded by fabD (14Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the M. tuberculosisgenome (15Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar) revealed that acpM (Rv2244) is genetically linked to Rv2243 whose product is homologous to FabD proteins from various microorganisms (16Verwoert I.I.

BothacpM and mtfabD belong to the same transcriptional unit that also includes kasA andkasB. In this study, we overexpressed, purified, and characterized M. tuberculosis AcpM and mtFabD. Overexpression of AcpM in Escherichia coli produced holo-AcpM, apo-AcpM, and palmitoylated-AcpM. The relative abundance of each form could be modulated by the growth conditions, a useful feature in generating valuable substrates (holo-AcpM and palmitoylated-AcpM) for future studies in fatty acid and mycolic acid biosynthesis inM. tuberculosis.2 Furthermore, we provide evidence that the product encoded by mtfabD catalyzes MCAT activity both in vivo and in vitro using E. coli holo-ACP and M. tuberculosis holo-AcpM, respectively, as substrates for transacylation. All cloning steps were performed in E. coli Top-10 (Invitrogen). Liquid cultures of recombinant E. coli were grown in LB broth at 37 °C with either 150 µg/ml ampicillin or 25 µg/ml kanamycin, according to the selection marker present on the plasmid. Strain LA2-89, a thermosensitive E. coli fabD mutant (fabD89), was a generous gift from A. R. Stuitje (16Verwoert I.I. Verbree E.C. van der Linden K.H. Nijkamp H.J. Stuitje A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2851-2857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli C41(DE3), which expresses the T7 RNA polymerase, was used as a host for the overproduction of M. tuberculosisAcpM and mtFabD and was kindly provided by B. Miroux and J. E. Walker (19Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Roche, and Vent DNA polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs. All DNA manipulations were performed using standard protocols, as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch F.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). TheacpM gene (Rv2244) was amplified by PCR fromM. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using the following primers: acpM-sense, 5′-ccg gcc cca tat gcc tgt cac tca gga aga aat cat-3′ (containing aNdeI restriction site, underlined); andacpM-antisense, 5′-cgaattctc act tgg act cgg cct caa-3′ (containing anEcoRI restriction site, underlined). The 365-base pair PCR product was purified, digested with NdeI andEcoRI, and ligated into pET28a (Novagen) that had been digested with the same enzymes. The DNA insert was sequenced to verify the absence of PCR artifacts. The resulting plasmid designated pET28a::acpM was used to transform E. coli C41 (DE3) for overproduction of the recombinant protein. An overnight culture of E. coli C41 (DE3) carrying pET28a::acpM was used to inoculate a large volume of LB broth supplemented with 25 µg/ml kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C under shaking until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.75. The culture was then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Growth was continued for another 3 h at 37 °C, and cells were harvested by centrifugation to obtain sample A. The pellet was resuspended in breakage buffer, 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5m NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, containing DNase, RNase, complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche), and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma). Bacteria were disrupted by passing twice through a French pressure cell, and the resulting extract was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and applied onto a Ni2+-charged His-Trap column (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with breakage buffer. The column was extensively washed with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm imidazole and eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole (50–500 mm). One-ml fractions were collected, and the presence of AcpM was detected by 15% SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Fractions containing pure AcpM were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. To determine changes in the relative amounts of different AcpM products, other culture conditions were also used. Briefly, to obtain sample B, cells were grown in LB to an optical density of 0.75, washed, transferred to fresh Terrific Broth medium supplemented with kanamycin, and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 16 °C. The M. tuberculosis holo-AcpM obtained above was further purified using a Thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with binding buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl). The products obtained from the Ni2+-charged His-Trap column were loaded onto the column and after several washes with binding buffer; holo-AcpM was eluted using binding buffer containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Purified holo-AcpM was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The PCR product corresponding tomtfabD (Rv2243) was obtained using the following primers:mtfabD-sense, 5′-ccg gcc ccatatgat tgc ctt gct cgc acc cgg aca g-3′ (containing aNdeI restriction site, underlined); andmtfabD-antisense, 5′-cgaattctg gcc gag tcc gcg gtt ata g-3′ (containing anEcoRI restriction site, underlined). The 941-base pair PCR product was purified, digested with NdeI andEcoRI, and ligated into pET28a that had been previously digested with the same enzymes. The DNA insert was sequenced to verify the absence of PCR artifacts. The resulting plasmid designated pET28a::mtfabD was used to transform strainE. coli C41 (DE3) for overproduction of the recombinant protein. Recombinant mtFabD was purified using the same conditions as described above for AcpM, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and stored at -20 °C. The purity of mtFabD was evaluated by 10% SDS-PAGE analysis. For complementation studies in E. coli,mtfabD from M. tuberculosis was first amplified by PCR using the following primers: mtfabD1-sense, 5′-cgg ccc cat atg att gcc ttg ctc gca ccc gga cag-3′; andmtfabD-antisense, 5′-cga att ctg gcc gag tcc gcg gtt ata g-3′. This PCR product was then ligated into pUC18 linearized bySmaI, thus generating pUC18::mtfabD, in which mtfabD was cloned in frame and downstream of thelacZ promoter. E. coli LA2-89 was transformed with either pUC18 or pUC18::mtfabD and grown on LB medium containing 2 g/liter NaCl and supplemented with 150 µg/ml ampicillin. Plates were incubated either at 37 °C (permissive temperature) or at 40 °C (non-permissive temperature). Different mtFabD mutant proteins were constructed using pET28a::mtfabD as template for the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primers: Q9A, 5′-ttg ctc gca ccc gga gcg ggt tcg caa acc gag-3′ and 5′-ctc ggt ttg cga acc cgc tcc ggg tgc gag caa-3′; R116A, 5′-gcg ctg gcc gcc acc gcc ggc gcc gag atg gcc-3′ and 5′-ggc cat ctc ggc gcc ggc ggt ggc ggc cag cgc-3′; H194A, 5′-gtc gcc gga gcg ttc gcc acc gag ttc atg gcg-3′ and 5′-cgc cat gaa ctc ggt ggc gaa cgc tcc ggc gac-3′; Q243A, 5′-gac acc ctg gtc tcc gcg ctc acc caa ccg gtg-3′and 5′-cac cgg ttg ggt gag cgc gga gac cag ggt gtc-3′; S191A, 5′-cgt ggc cgg cca cgc cgt cgg cga aat cgc ggc-3′ and 5′-gcc gcg att tcg ccg acg gcg tgg ccg gcc acg -3′; S91T, 5′-ccg gcc aca ccg tcg gcg a-3′ and 5′-tcg ccg acg gtg tgg ccg g-3′. All mutant clones used for enzyme preparations were verified by DNA sequencing. A 25-µl reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 µg of mtFabD, and 75 nCi of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (50–62 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding acidic gel loading buffer, and the reaction products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. mtFabD was assayed by its ability to catalyze the transfer of the malonyl group from [2-14C]malonyl-CoA to holo-AcpM. Briefly, a reaction mixture containing 10 µm malonyl-CoA (9.2 µm unlabeled malonyl-CoA and 0.8 µm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA [36,000 cpm]), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and 10 nm mtFabD in a final volume of 100 µl was incubated for 5 min at room temperature during which the malonyl-CoA substrate did not become rate-limiting. The reaction was subsequently quenched by the addition of 900 µl of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Precipitation was completed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Centrifugation at 18,000 ×g for 10 min yielded a pellet that was washed with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 20 µl of 2% SDS containing 20 mm aqueous NaOH. The total cpm of radiolabeled material in the suspension was measured by scintillation counting using 5 ml of EcoScintA. The apparent K m values of mtFabD for M. tuberculosis AcpM were determined by initial velocity measurements under standard conditions using variable concentrations of holo-AcpM. The apparent K m value of mtFabD for malonyl-CoA was determined using 20 µm holo-AcpM and variable concentrations of malonyl-CoA with a fixed activity of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA as described in the standard assay. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a MiniProtean II system (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) and stained with Coomassie Blue R350 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce Europe, Oud-Beijerland, Netherlands). Mass spectrometry was carried out on a Micromass Platform II single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The sample was delivered into the mass spectrometer by an Agilent 1050 liquid chromatograph after in-line desalting. Edman degradation was carried out on an Agilent Edman sequencer. In this study, we have cloned the M. tuberculosis acpM into an E. coliexpression vector, allowing AcpM to be produced as a His-tagged protein. Different culture conditions were used, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” to generate sample A and sample B. Recombinant proteins were overexpressed and purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+ affinity column. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the eluted fractions from sample A showed the presence of three distinct protein bands (Fig. 1,lane 1), which were subjected to automated N-terminal sequencing. The sequence obtained, GSSHHHHHHGLVPRGSHM, was consistent with the expected N terminus of AcpM (minus the N-terminal Met residue). This was confirmed by ES-MS of the intact protein and was also a characteristic feature of the proteins analyzed from sample B by ES-MS. The major mass spectral peaks from sample A are shown in Fig.2. The calculated mass of the apo-AcpM (based on the amino acid sequence and taking into account the N-terminal data) is 14,556 Da. The holo-AcpM form of the protein (after addition of the 4′-phosphopantetheine group, 339 Da) has a molecular mass of 14,895 Da. The analysis by ES-MS demonstrates that the major product of sample A is apo-AcpM with significant amounts of holo-AcpM and palmitoylated-AcpM assuming an error of ±2 Da (Fig. 2). In contrast, sample B contains predominantly holo-AcpM and palmitoylated-AcpM with a minor peak observed at 14,554 Da for apo-AcpM, by ES-MS analyses (data not shown). Analysis by PAGE (Fig. 1,lane 2), supported by the above ES-MS analysis, confirms the identity of the middle band as apo-AcpM. Subsequent purification of sample B using thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B chromatography yielded the top band (Fig. 1, lane 3), which by ES-MS analysis (data not shown) was confirmed as holo-AcpM and a substrate for mtFabD (see below). Therefore, the identity of the lower band was deduced as palmitoylated-AcpM. Interestingly, treatment of either sample A or B with dithiothreitol2 cleaved the acyl group from palmitoylated-AcpM, yielding higher concentrations of holo-AcpM (data not shown), also confirming the identity of the lower band by PAGE analysis as an acyl-AcpM product. Altogether, the N-terminal sequencing and ES-MS analysis demonstrate that both samples contain AcpM, and appear to contain apo-, holo-, or palmitoylated forms, although present in different relative proportions. Sample A consists of apo-AcpM > palmitoylated AcpM > holo-AcpM, whereas sample B consists of holo-AcpM > palmitoylated AcpM ≫ apo-AcpM. In addition, these differences in intensities do appear to correspond to those seen on PAGE analysis (Fig. 1).Figure 2Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis ofM. tuberculosis AcpM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The predicted product of the first open reading frame (Rv2243) of the acpM/kasAB operon is a 30.7-kDa protein that bears strong similarity with MCAT (FabD) from various microorganisms as shown in Fig.3. Rv2243 is 29% and 51% identical to its E. coli and Streptomyces coelicolor A3 FabD, respectively. A high resolution crystal structure of E. coliFabD has been reported (22Serre L. Verbree E.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12961-12964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and has revealed that Ser-92 and His-201 are involved in catalysis. In addition, the main chain carbonyl of Gln-250 serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor in an interaction with His-201. Two other residues, Arg-117 and Gln-11, have also been shown to be located in the active site (22Serre L. Verbree E.C. Dauter Z. Stuitje A.R. Derewenda Z.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12961-12964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The five catalytic residues belonging to the E. coli FabD (Gln-11, Ser-92, Arg-117, His-201, Gln-250) are fully conserved among the different organisms and are referred to as Gln-9, Ser-91, Arg-116, His-194, and Gln-243 in the mycobacterial protein (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the catalytic Ser-91 is located at the center of a GHSVG pentapeptide, which corresponds to the GXSXG signature motif of serine-dependent acylhydrolases (23Brenner S. Nature. 1988; 334: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To provide evidence of the function of M. tuberculosis Rv2243, complementation experiments were undertaken. The gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into pUC18. The construct, named pUC18::mtfabD, was used to transform E. coli LA2-89 temperature-sensitive mutant deficient in MCAT activity. This strain carries an amber mutation in the fabD gene together with a supEtRNA suppressor (24Verwoert I.I. Verhagen E.F. van der Linden K.H. Verbree E.C. Nijkamp H.J. Stuitje A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The complementation of strain LA2-89 with pUC18::mtfabD at 37 °C (permissive temperature) and 40 °C (non-permissive temperature) are shown in Fig.4. The complemented strain was able to grow at both 37 °C and 40 °C, whereas the control strain (LA2-89 transformed with pUC18) failed to grow at the non-permissive temperature of 40 °C, directly demonstrating that Rv2243 possesses MCAT activity in E. coli. A hexa-histidine (His6)-tagged mtFabD protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography as shown in Fig. 5. Its observed molecular mass of ∼33 kDa is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of mtFabD (30.7 kDa) plus the 6-His containing N-terminal extension. The purified protein was used to determine its enzymatic characteristics. Initial velocities were first measured as a function of malonyl-CoA concentration (Fig.6A). The double-reciprocal plot analysis indicated that mtFabD has an apparentKm for malonyl-CoA of 12.6 µm(Fig. 6 A). In a second series of experiments, the concentration of malonyl-CoA was kept constant, whereas increasing concentrations of holo-AcpM were added to the reaction mixture. Under these conditions, an apparent Km for holo-AcpM of 14.1 µm was obtained (Fig. 6 B). Holo-AcpM constituted a better substrate than E. coli holo-ACP, since it was more rapidly malonylated by M. tuberculosis MCAT (Fig. 6 C). Nevertheless, the mycobacterial mtFabD was able to convert the E. coli holo-ACP into malonyl-ACP, confirming the previous data obtained in vivo in the complementedfabD mutant LA2-89 strain.Figure 6Kinetic analysis and substrate specificity of mtFabD for malonyl-CoA and different ACPs. A, initial velocities of malonyl-AcpM production were measured with purified mtFabD and holo-AcpM, in the presence of increasing concentrations of malonyl-CoA. The linear fit was used to calculate theKm and V max values for malonyl-CoA. B, initial velocities of malonyl-AcpM production were measured with purified mtFabD, malonyl-CoA, and increasing concentrations of M. tuberculosis holo-AcpM.C, comparison of velocities for M. tuberculosisholo-AcpM (●) and E. coli holo-ACP (○). It was also interesting to note that storage and freeze thawing of the mtFabD proteins resulted in ∼70% reduction in MCAT activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Extensive analysis of acyltransferases from various fatty acid or polyketide synthases has demonstrated that a serine, such as Ser-92 in the E. coli FabD protein (16Verwoert I.I.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), is the active nucleophilic residue of these enzymes. During its transfer from malonyl-CoA to ACP, the malonyl moiety is transiently attached to this serine to form a stable malonyl-serine enzyme intermediate (26Prescott D.J. Vagelos P.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1972; 36: 269-311PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleophilic attack of this ester by the sulfhydryl of ACP yields malonyl-ACP. An alignment of different FabD enzymes from various organisms suggested the assignment of Ser-91 as the active residue in mtFabD (Fig. 3). Therefore, we constructed and analyzed a number of mtFabD mutant proteins (Fig.7A). In two of these mutant proteins, designated S91A and S91T, in which either Ala or Thr substituted the active Ser, no MCAT activity could be detected, indicating that Ser-91 plays a key role in catalysis (Fig.7 B). Based on the three-dimensional structure of theE. coli protein, four other residues were also shown to play a critical role in catalysis. Alignments presented in Fig. 3 revealed that these residues are fully conserved among various microorganisms. We replaced Gln-9, Arg-116, His-194, and Gln-243 individually by alanine, and the purified proteins were analyzed for MCAT activity (Fig. 7, A and B). MCAT activity of all mutants was abolished, confirming the importance of these amino acids in transacylation (Fig. 7 B). Incubation of the wild-type mtFabD and mutant mtFabD proteins with 14C-labeled malonyl-CoA and analysis by SDS-PAGE autoradiography showed that the malonyl group could be covalently attached to some of the proteins, i.e.Q9A and R116A, in addition to wild-type mtFabD (Fig.7 C). It has been previously shown that FabD is a critical enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in all bacteria, by catalyzing the transacylation reaction of malonate from malonyl-CoA to holo-ACP; malonyl-ACP is a key substrate for elongation of fatty acids.

In bacteria, the SsrA·SmpB quality control system helps to ensure proper protein synthesis by rescuing stalled ribosomes and by marking the incomplete proteins associated with these ribosomes for destruction (1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). SsrA is an RNA molecule (363 bases in Escherichia coli) with a tRNA-like domain that can be charged with alanine and a short mRNA-like reading frame encoding the peptide sequence ANDENYALAA (Refs. 2Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 3Ushida C. Himeno H. Watanabe T. Muto A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9322-9326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1A). Together with SmpB, an associated and required protein factor, SsrA appears to be recruited when ribosomes stall on mRNAs during translation (5Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 6Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A cotranslational tagging process then occurs in which SsrA first acts as tRNA, donating its charged alanine to the stalled peptide chain, then displaces the problematic message, and finally serves as mRNA, directing synthesis of the last 10 residues of the AANDENYALAA peptide tag. SsrA recruits the termination factors required to release the tagged protein, and the modified protein is subsequently recognized and degraded by specific proteases (5Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 7Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) The SsrA·SmpB system is universally conserved among bacteria, and a variety of phenotypes are observed in mutant strains (1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 9Keiler K.C. Shapiro L. Williams K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7778-7783Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Deletions of SsrA or SmpB are lethal in some bacteria and cause slow growth under stress conditions in other bacteria (10Hutchison C.A. Peterson S.N. Gill S.R. Cline R.T. White O. Fraser C.M. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Science. 1999; 286: 2165-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 11Huang C. Wolfgang M.C. Withey J. Koomey M. Friedman D.I.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In E. coli, for instance, the growth defects of strains lacking SsrA are magnified at high temperatures or under carbon starvation (2Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 13Oh B.K. Apirion D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that quality assurance becomes more important when the incidence of translational errors is elevated. Other phenotypes of SsrA-defective E. coli include reduced motility (2Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), increased protease activity (14Kirby J.E. Trempy J.E. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2068-2081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), defects in plating of phage λimmP22 and induction of temperature-sensitive lysogens of phage Mu (6Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 15Retallack D.M. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2082-2089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and increased levels of LacI, λ cI, and LexA repression (16Retallack D.M. Friedman D.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 227-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). What features of mRNAs lead to ribosome stalling and SsrA recruitment? SsrA tagging has been demonstrated for proteins translated from truncated mRNAs that lack in-frame stop codons (5Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). A message of this type is translated to its 3′ end where the ribosome stalls because there is no termination codon to recruit release factors. Tagging of E. coli LacI repressor appears to occur by this mechanism, with truncation of the mRNA occurring because Lac repressor binds to an operator site within the lacI gene and blocks completion of transcription (17Abo T. Inada T. Ogawa K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3762-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In a SsrA-defective cell, active Lac repressor missing a short, non-essential C-terminal region is synthesized from the truncated transcript. This presumably explains why Lac repressor activity is elevated in SsrA deletion strains. SsrA tagging of model substrates has also been shown to occur when their mRNAs contain rare codon repeats (18Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In this case, the principal site of tagging corresponded to the first rare codon of the repeat, and tagging could be suppressed by overproduction of the cognate tRNA, suggesting that ribosome stalling at the rare codon repeat leads to recruitment of SsrA and subsequent tagging. At present, Lac repressor is the only normal E. coli protein for which SsrA tagging has been demonstrated (17Abo T. Inada T. Ogawa K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3762-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, although it seems likely that prolonged ribosome stalling may cause SsrA tagging in cases other than truncated mRNAs or runs of rare codons, this has not been demonstrated. SsrA tagging of proteins in vivois difficult to probe directly because the tagged proteins are degraded. To obviate this problem, a mutant (SsrA-DD) with base substitutions that change the C terminus of the peptide tag from AA to DD has been used with antibodies specific for the mutant tag allowing detection of tagged proteins (17Abo T. Inada T. Ogawa K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3762-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Studies of this type have revealed low-level tagging of at least 20–30 proteins in E. coli, but the actual number and identities of these tagged proteins are unknown. In this paper, we have constructed a novel SsrA mutant that adds a His6 affinity tag to modified proteins. Affinity purification of these tagged proteins followed by separations on two-dimensional gels has allowed us to estimate the extent of tagging and to identify additional proteins that are subject to SsrA tagging. In two cases, characterization of the tagged product by mass spectroscopy has shown that the tag is added immediately after the normal C-terminal residue of the protein, suggesting that the ribosome stalls and tagging occurs at a position corresponding to the normal termination codon. E. coli strain ER1000A isssrA::cat slyD::kan ara Δ(lac pro) nalA argEam rif thi-1/F'lac+ pro+lacIq and was constructed by P1 transduction of the ssrA::catgene disruption from strain X90ssrA::cat (5Keiler K.C.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 1B. Brown, unpublished data. Strain W3110ssrA::kan has been previously described (2Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), as have plasmids pKW1 (control), pKW11 (wild-type SsrA), pKW22 (SsrA-DD), and pKW23 (SsrA-DD), each of which contains a p15a origin of replication and a tetracycline resistance gene (18Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Plasmid pKW24 (SsrA-H6) is identical to pKW11 except for the mutations indicated in Fig. 1 and was constructed in collaboration with Kelly Williams. Plasmid pPW500 expresses the λ-cI-N-trpAt message with no in-frame stop codon (5Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTMK1 2T. Karplus, unpublished data. is a pBR322 derivative (ampR) that encodes the λcI repressor gene under lac promoter control from pKB280 (20Nelson H.C. Sauer R.T. Cell. 1985; 42: 549-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTrc-99a was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phage λimmP22 dis c2–5 (15Retallack D.M. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2082-2089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was plated on strain W3110 ssrA::kantransformed with pKW1, pKW11, pKW22, or pKW24. Growth at 37 °C or 43 °C of strain W3110 ssrA::kancontaining pKW1, pKW11, or pKW24 was assayed by changes inA 600; the values from two independent cultures were averaged and fit to an exponential function for determination of growth rates. All strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) media containing 24 µg/ml tetracycline unless indicated. Strain X90ssrA::cat transformed with pPW500 and either pKW1, pKW11, pKW23, or pKW24 was grown in LB broth containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 50 µg/ml tetracycline to an A 600 of roughly 0.8, and expression of λ-cI-N-trpAt was induced by addition of IPTG3 to 1 mm. After 1 h, samples were removed to ice, and the cells were collected and frozen at −80 °C. Thawed cell pellets were lysed with SDS sample buffer, heated to >95 °C, and electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide SDS Tris-tricine gel, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was probed with M2 anti-FLAG antibodies (Eastman Kodak) to detect the FLAG epitope present in the λ-cI-N-trpAt protein. Strain ER1000A transformed with pKW1 and pTMK1, pKW24 and pTrc-99a, or pKW24 and pTMK1 was grown in LB broth containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 20 µg/ml tetracycline to an A 600 of roughly 0.5, and 1 mm IPTG was added to induce expression of λ repressor from the lac promoter. After 2 h, samples were removed, processed as described above, electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide SDS Laemmli gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Different portions of the resulting blot were probed with either His probe H-15 HRP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 51F 7G11 antibodies to λ cI repressor (21Breyer R.M. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13355-13360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SsrA-H6-tagged λ repressor was purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography under denaturing conditions according to the Qiagen protocol with minor modifications. All purification steps were performed in 6 m guanidine·Cl (Mallinckrodt). Binding and wash buffers contained 10 mmimidazole, and the elution buffer contained 0.1 m acetic acid. The pH value of the eluate was increased by addition of 1/10 volume of 2 m Tris (pH 9.5), and the eluted proteins were concentrated by a second round of Ni2+-NTA chromatography. The final eluate was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8) and assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The SsrA-H6-tagged repressor was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager instrument with sinapinic acid as the matrix and horse heart myoglobin and chymotrypsinogen A (Sigma) as internal standards. Mass fingerprinting of tryptic peptides from in-gel digests of tagged repressor was performed as described below and without alkylation. For experiments comparing SsrA-H6 (pKW24) cells to those lacking SsrA (pKW1), multiple 1-liter cultures were grown to an A 600 of 0.8–0.9 in 6-liter flasks and purified through two rounds of Ni2+-NTA chromatography. To obtain more concentrated proteins for identification, 10-liter fermentor cultures of ER1000A/pKW24 were grown to an A 600 of 1.8, and three rounds of Ni2+-NTA purification were performed. The pattern of tagged proteins obtained by both methods was similar. Purifications performed either in 6 m guanidine·Cl or in deionized 8m urea (Mallinckrodt or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, both >99.5% purity) also gave similar results. Cells from a typical fermentor culture were suspended in 200 ml lysis buffer (6 m guanidine·Cl, 1% Triton, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 8) and lysed by stirring for an h. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at >30,000 g, and the supernatant was mixed with 6 ml of a Ni2+-NTA slurry equilibrated in lysis buffer and allowed to bind with rocking for one h. The resin was collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 40 ml of lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with 16 ml of elution buffer (6 m guanidine·Cl, 1% Triton, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m acetic acid), and the pH vavlue was raised by adding 1/10 volume of 2 m Tris (pH 9.5). This eluate was rebound to 1.5 ml Ni2+-NTA slurry in wash buffer (lysis buffer containing 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) by rocking for 1 h. The resin was collected and washed twice with 10 ml of wash buffer, bound protein was eluted with 4 ml elution buffer, and the pH value was raised by Tris addition. In the final round of purification, proteins were bound to 1 ml of resin slurry, washed twice with 6 ml of wash buffer, and eluted in small steps resulting in recovery of the majority of protein in a single 0.4 ml fraction. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed according to protocols in the Amersham Pharmacia manuals. Equal volumes of Ni2+-NTA purified protein and rehydration solution were mixed with 18-cm, pH range 4–7 immobilized pH gradient strips. Following rehydration, isoelectric focusing was performed on a Multiphor II unit. Proteins were alkylated by soaking the immobilized pH gradient strips in SDS equilibration solution containing iodoacetamide as described. Purification in the second dimension was performed by electrophoresis on a 10–18% gradient polyacrylamide gel with SDS Laemmli buffer using the Hoefer Dalt system. Silver staining was performed essentially as described (22Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Western blots were also performed on the Dalt system and were probed with His probe H-15 HRP antibodies. Silver-stained gels were dried, and protein spots were excised and processed for peptide mass fingerprinting as described (22Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar) except alkylation was not repeated and digestions of proteins in the gel used 80 ng/µl modified trypsin (Roche Diagnostics). Tryptic peptides were eluted from the gel by multiple extractions with 5% formic acid and 50% acetonitrile, dried under vacuum, resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and bound to C18 ZipTips (Millipore). Samples were eluted with a 50–75% acetonitrile solution containing α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and were spotted directly on target plates for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager instrument. Calibration of mass spectra was typically performed using trypsin autodigestion peaks as internal standards. Spectra were compared with controls obtained by processing an empty portion of the gel, and only peaks significantly above background were selected. Peptide fingerprint searches were performed using MS-Fit (prospector.ucsf.edu), searching the Swiss-Prot database of E. coli sequences of all molecular weights and pI's. The PAWS program (ProteoMetrics) was used to help identify junction peptides containing the SsrA-H6 tag. The reading frame of the SsrA degradation tag was modified by directed mutagenesis to encode HHHHHH as its C-terminal residues (Fig.1 A). This mutant RNA, called SsrA-H6, was designed to have the same length of coding sequence as wild-type SsrA and to maintain base pairing within the stem-loop region that begins with the final codons of the tag sequence (Fig. 1 A). We expected that the His6 epitope on proteins tagged by SsrA-H6 would slow degradation and also allow affinity purification. SsrA-H6 RNA showed biological activity in several different assays. Active SsrA is required for efficient plating of the hybrid phage λimmP22 (15Retallack D.M. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2082-2089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An SsrA-deletion strain expressing SsrA-H6 RNA from a plasmid supported λimmP22 growth at about 50% of the efficiency of a comparable strain expressing plasmid-borne wild-type SsrA, whereas the deletion strain showed a 10,000-fold reduction in plaque formation (Fig.1 B). Expression of SsrA-H6 RNA also largely complemented the slow growth of SsrA-deficient E. coli at 43 °C (Fig. 1 C) and at 37 °C, where the growth defect is subtle (Fig. 1 C, inset). Co-expression of SsrA-H6 RNA and λ-cI-N-trpAt mRNA, an artificial substrate expressing the N-terminal domain of λ repressor without in-frame termination codons (5Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), resulted in tagging of the λ-cI-N-trpAt protein (Fig. 1 D,lane a, upper band). This tagged band was not observed in the absence of SsrA-H6 (Fig. 1 D,lane c). As judged by the ratio of tagged to untagged products, SsrA-H6 tagging of λ-cI-N-trpAt was at least as efficient as tagging by the SsrA-DD mutant (Fig.1 D, lane b). However, tagging mediated by these plasmid-borne SsrA mutants is less efficient than tagging mediated by plasmid-borne or chromosomal wild-type SsrA (Ref. 18Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar; essentially no untagged protein appears in Fig. 1 D, lane d). This experiment also shows that proteins with the AANDEHHHHHH tag are not subject to rapid degradation in contrast to λ-cI-N-trpAt protein tagged by wild-type SsrA (Ref. 5Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 D, lane d). Hence, although SsrA-H6-tagged proteins are not degraded rapidly, the SsrA-H6 mutant is still biologically active. This result is consistent with previous studies that have shown that the ribosome-rescue functions of SsrA are more important for biological function than the subsequent degradation of tagged proteins (23Withey J. Friedman D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As noted above, λ repressor activity is increased in SsrA-defective strains (16Retallack D.M. Friedman D.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 227-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To test if this phenotype might be a consequence of tagging by SsrA, we co-expressed SsrA-H6 RNA and wild-type λ repressor from an overproducing plasmid. Western blots of cell lysates were then probed with anti-His6 antibodies, revealing a major tagged band (Fig. 2, lane b). This band was shown to be tagged λ repressor by several criteria. First, it was not observed if either SsrA-H6 or λ repressor was absent (Fig. 2, lanes a and c). Second, a band with the same electrophoretic mobility also cross-reacted with anti-λ repressor antibodies (Fig. 2, lane e) and was missing if either SsrA-H6 or λ repressor was not expressed (Fig. 2,lanes d and f). The SsrA-H6-tagged λ repressor was present at roughly 3–5% of the level of untagged λ repressor as judged by the intensities of both bands in Western blots. Expression of SsrA-H6 also resulted in the tagging of several additional proteins (Fig. 2,lanes b and c) that were missing in the absence of SsrA-H6 (Fig. 2, lane a). Cell lysates containing the SsrA-H6-tagged λ repressor were purified by several cycles of chromatography on Ni2+-NTA resin under denaturing conditions. SDS gels of the final eluate showed a major band corresponding in size to SsrA-H6-tagged λ repressor (data not shown). A few proteins of lower molecular weight were present in the eluate, but these species were also observed in a parallel purification from cells lacking SsrA (data not shown). MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy of the eluate gave one major peak above 15 kDa with a mass of 27,437 ± 42 Da, which corresponded within error to that expected for the complete λ repressor sequence plus the 11-residue AANDEHHHHHH tag (27,404 Da; Fig. 2). The tagged repressor was digested in-gel with trypsin, and the masses of eluted peptides were determined. A tryptic peptide of mass 2687.7 ± 0.8 Da was observed that did not occur in the normal repressor sequence but matched a junction peptide including the C-terminal tryptic fragment of λ repressor plus the SsrA-H6 tag (2687.8 Da; Fig. 2). These observations indicate that tagging occurs after the normal C-terminal residue of the λ repressor protein. Tagging at this position suggests that when ribosomes stop translation at the UGA codon at the 3′ end of the λcI gene, SsrA tagging competes with the termination and release mechanism mediated by release factor 2. How many E. coli proteins are tagged by the SsrA·SmpB system? To address this question, Ni2+-NTA purifications involving two to three rounds of chromatography under denaturing conditions were performed in parallel, starting with lysates of log-phase cultures of cells containing or lacking SsrA-H6. The resulting eluates were further purified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with the focusing dimension ranging from pH 4 to 7, which includes the isoelectric points of most E. coli proteins. Silver staining of the two-dimensional gel from the control purification (no SsrA-H6) showed a number of spots (Fig.3A) even though the gene for SlyD, a His-rich protein that binds to Ni2+-NTA, was disrupted in the strain used for these studies. By comparison, however, far more proteins were observed in the two-dimensional gel from the strain containing SsrA-H6 (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, most proteins observed in the SsrA-H6 strain but not the control strain cross-reacted with anti-His6 antibodies in a Western blot (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that a complex mixture of tagged proteins is generated in E. coli, even under non-stress conditions where nutrients are plentiful. The mass of SsrA-H6-tagged proteins obtained by affinity purification represented roughly 0.01 to 0.05% of the total mass of cellular proteins as judged by the intensities of stained gels (data not shown). However, estimates of the abundance and number of tagged proteins may be somewhat low because tagged proteins of high molecular weight seemed to be selectively lost during purification (data not shown) and SsrA-H6 is less active in tagging than wild-type SsrA (Fig. 1D). The presence of shadow spots at slightly lower pI's for many of the proteins in the control and SsrA-H6 samples (Fig. 3) is also a complicating factor. Nevertheless, whether these shadow spots are produced by modifications in vivo or during purification, it is clear that a large number of species with different isoelectric points and molecular weights are generated by tagging mediated by the SsrA·SmpB quality control system. Roughly 20 of the most prominent SsrA-H6-tagged proteins from the two-dimensional gels were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The resulting sets of peptide masses were then used to search a database for potential matches. Several differences from a standard proteomics analysis are noteworthy. First, tagging at internal positions will lead to truncated proteins, and fewer peptides will therefore be available to match the wild-type sequence. Second, although characterization of the junction peptide containing both the protein and the tag sequences could determine the site of tagging, the mass of this peptide cannot be predicted a priori, and it is possible that tagging could occur at different sites resulting in a heterogeneous set of junction peptides. In the end, we were able to identify five SsrA-tagged proteins, including YbeL (spot A,Fig. 3 B); LacI (spot B, Fig. 3 B); SlyD (spot C, Fig. 3 B); GalE (spot D, Fig.3 B); and RbsK (spot E, Fig. 3 B) with a high degree of confidence using the search program MS-Fit (prospector.ucsf.edu).

https://openalex.org/W2015112918,"Mammalian phospholipase D (PLD) plays a key role in several signal transduction pathways and is involved in many diverse functions. To elucidate the complex molecular regulation of PLD, we investigated PLD-binding proteins obtained from rat brain extract. Here we report that a 43-kDa protein in the rat brain, β-actin, acts as a major PLD2 direct-binding protein as revealed by peptide mass fingerprinting in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We also determined that the region between amino acids 613 and 723 of PLD2 is required for the direct binding of β-actin, using bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of PLD2 fragments. Intriguingly, purified β-actin potently inhibited both phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate- and oleate-dependent PLD2 activities in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 5 nm). In a previous paper, we reported that α-actinin inhibited PLD2 activity in an interaction-dependent and an ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1)-reversible manner (Park, J. B., Kim, J. H., Kim, Y., Ha, S. H., Kim, J. H., Yoo, J.-S., Du, G., Frohman, M. A., Suh, P.-G., and Ryu, S. H. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 21295–21301). In vitro binding analyses showed that β-actin could displace α-actinin binding to PLD2, demonstrating independent interaction between cytoskeletal proteins and PLD2. Furthermore, ARF1 could steer the PLD2 activity in a positive direction regardless of the inhibitory effect of β-actin on PLD2. We also observed that β-actin regulates PLD1 and PLD2 with similar binding and inhibitory potencies. Immunocytochemical and co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated the in vivointeraction between the two PLD isozymes and actin in cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the regulation of PLD by cytoskeletal proteins, β-actin and α-actinin, and ARF1 may play an important role in cytoskeleton-related PLD functions.

These relationships suggest that agonist-induced PLD activation may play roles in multiple signaling events (2Jones D. Morgan C. Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys.

The mammalian PLD isozymes identified thus far, PLD1 and PLD2, share a sequence homology of ∼50%, but they have very different regulatory properties. PLD1 has low basal activity in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and can be activated by several cytosolic factors including protein kinase C α and small GTP-binding proteins such as Rho A, Rac-1, ARF1, RalA, and CDC42 (8Sung T.C.

PLD2 also depends on PIP2 but has a higher basal activity than PLD1 (16Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12846-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that PLD2 may be closely associated with different cellular inhibitors. Although many studies continue to focus on the functional relationships and the isozyme specificities of the PLD isozymes, the molecular mechanism of the regulation of the PLDs has not been fully elucidated. In this regard, the identification of PLD-binding partners may provide clues toward the understanding of the complex regulatory mechanism of PLD in different cells. It has been observed in many studies that PLD is crucially implicated in the actin-based cytoskeleton of cells. More recently, PLD activity has been found in the detergent-insoluble fraction of various cell types that contain a wide range of cytoskeletal proteins (17Hodgkin M.N. Clark J.M. Rose S. Saqib K. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Iyer S.S. Kunser D.J. J. Biol.

Several cytoskeletal proteins such as fodrin and gelsolin have been found to act as PLD-specific inhibitors in vitro (19Lukowski S. Mira J.P. Jachowski A. Geny B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, we reported previously that α-actinin, an F-actin cross-linking protein, also binds to PLD2 to inhibit its activity (25Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y Ha S.H. Kim J.H. Yoo J. Du G.

Thus, there is a strong body of evidence supporting a possibly close regulatory association between PLD and the actin cytoskeleton. In our present study, we found for the first time that β-actin, a major cytoskeletal protein, negatively regulates PLD by direct binding. We also looked at the relationships and modes of action of ARF1 and other cytoskeletal proteins on PLD using PLD2 as a model enzyme, and the results obtained suggest possible mechanisms for the regulation of PLD by these cellular components. The enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL system), dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-[methyl-3H]choline, chelating-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, and Sephadex-150 resin were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, PIP2, dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, paraformaldehyde, and sodium oleate were purchased from Sigma. Anti-actin antibody was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. GTPγS was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Anti-ARF monoclonal antibody was provided kindly by Dr. Richard A. Kahn (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Full-length cDNAs of murine PLD2 and its N-terminal deletion mutant were provided generously by Dr. Michael A. Frohman (State University of New York, NY). Hexa-histidine (His6)-tagged PLD1 and PLD2 were purified from detergent extracts of baculovirus-infected sf9 cells by chelating-Sepharose affinity column chromatography as described previously (26Kim J.H.

Rat brains (3 g) were homogenized in homogenation buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 150 mm NaCl) using a polytron homogenizer. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was used to investigate potential PLD2-binding partners. Protein concentrations in the brain extract were determined using the methods developed by Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-PLD antibodies immobilized on protein A resin (PLD antibody complex) were first incubated with purified recombinant PLD2 (3 µg) for 2 h. After a brief centrifugation, the immune complexes were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1% TX-100, and 1% deoxycholate). The prepared brain extract (3 mg of protein) was then incubated with the complexes for 2 h at 4 °C. Finally, the co-precipitated proteins were washed again three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, loaded onto a gel, and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The technique used was performed as described previously (25Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y Ha S.H. Kim J.H. Yoo J. Du G. Frohman M.A. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol.

In brief, the fraction containing 43-kDa protein (p43) after co-immunoprecipitation from rat brain extract was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and the band corresponding to p43 was excised and digested with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 6 h at 37 °C. The masses of the tryptic peptides obtained were determined with a Voyager DE time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perceptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) in the Korea Basic Science Institute. Delayed ion extraction resulted in peptide masses with better than 50 ppm mass accuracy on average. Using the amino acid sequences and the mass numbers of the tryptic peptides of p43, the Swiss-Prot data base was searched for a protein match. β-actin was purified from rat brain as described previously (28Bray D. Thomas C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 105: 527-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and assessed to be >90% pure by Coomassie staining. Myristoylated recombinant ARF1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified (29Lambeth J.D. Kwak J.-Y. Bowman E.P. Perry D. Uhlinger D.J. Lopez I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2431-2434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of human PLD2 was digested into fragments containing specific domains. These individual PLD2 fragments were then ligated into the EcoRI or SmaI site of the pGEX4T3 vector. Human β-actin cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Jungchul Kim (Kyungpook National University, Korea), was then ligated into the EcoRI site of the pGEX4T1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subcloning and the polymerase chain reaction were used to produce the expression vectors encoding the respective GST fusion proteins (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with individual expression vectors encoding the GST fusion proteins, and after harvesting the cells the GST fusion proteins expressed were purified by standard methods (31Lee C.

All operations were performed at 4 °C in a refrigerated room or on ice. The two recombinant PLD isozymes prepared or COS-7 cell extracts overexpressing wild type and the N-terminal deletion mutant of murine PLD2 (Δ1–185) were first bound to PLD antibody complexes. These were then respectively incubated with the indicated amounts of purified β-actin or ARF1 for 15 min at 37 °C. At this stage, all of the PLD-binding partners were present in the PLD assay buffer (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, and 80 mm KC1) containing 0.5% β-octylglucopyranoside. After brief centrifugation, the co-precipitated complexes were washed three times in the same buffer before being loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel. The in vitrobinding of the GST-PLD2 fragments with β-actin was also performed in the same buffer containing 1% TX-100. All procedures using α-actinin binding were similar to those used for β-actin binding. In brief, PLD2 immune complexes were incubated with α-actinin and β-actin at 37 °C for 15 min in the PLD assay buffer, and the resulting co-precipitates were washed with the same buffer containing 0.25% CHAPS as described previously (25Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y Ha S.H. Kim J.H. Yoo J. Du G. Frohman M.A. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21295-21301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PIP2-dependent PLD activity was assayed by measuring choline release from phosphatidylcholine (12Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, the reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min in a 125-µl assay mixture containing the PLD assay buffer, the PLD preparation, and 25 µl of phospholipid vesicles composed of dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, PIP2, dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, and dipalmitoyl[methyl-3H]choline (a total of 150,000 cpm/assay) in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1. Oleate-dependent PLD activity was assayed as described earlier (26Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, PC vesicles (25 µl) containing 5 nmol of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine and 200,000 dpm of dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-[methyl-3H]choline were added to a reaction mixture (175 µl) containing 50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 20 µm sodium oleate, and 0.1 m KCl. The final concentration of PC in the reaction mixture was 25 µm. The assay mixture was then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.3 ml of 1 n HCl/5 mm EGTA and 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:50:0.3). After a brief centrifugation, the amount of [methyl-3H]choline in 0.5 ml of the aqueous phase was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C in a Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting using the Bio-Rad wet transfer system. After blocking in TTBS buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk powder, the membranes were incubated with individual monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, which was subsequently followed by another incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, as required, coupled with horseradish peroxidase. Detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit according to manufacturer instructions. The tetracycline-regulated (Tet-off) expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to induce the expression of PLD2 in PC12 cells (33Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5 µg/ml tetracycline, 10% (v/v) equine serum, and 5% fetal calf serum. To induce PLD2, the cells were grown in the same medium without tetracycline. COS-7 cells were maintained in a growth medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2-controlled (5%) incubator. For transfection and the transient expression of PLD isoforms, COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 100-mm dishes and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (34Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5462-5470PubMed Google Scholar). PLD2-inducible PC12 cells cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline or COS-7 cells overexpressing PLD1 were lysed with PLD assay buffer containing 1% cholate, 1% TX-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 5 µg/ml aprotinin. After brief sonication, the cell lysates were incubated for 2 h with constant agitation and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The cell extracts (1 mg of protein) recovered were incubated with anti-PLD antibody-immobilized on protein A resin for 2 h. After brief centrifugation, the co-immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer before being loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel for immunoblot analysis. Cells transfected with the wild type and the N-terminal deletion mutant of murine PLD2 (Δ1–185) were disrupted by sonication in ice-cold PLD assay buffer. The lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and referred to as membranes. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (35Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.A. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Jang I.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13621-13627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, PC12 cells grown on coverslips in the presence or absence of tetracyclin were rinsed with PBS four times and fixed with 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. After rinsing with PBS and blocking with PBS containing 1% goat serum and 0.1% TX-100 for 4 h at 4 °C, the cells were incubated with 2 µg/ml primary polyclonal antibody specific to PLD overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed six times with PBS containing 0.05% TX-100 and then incubated in this washing medium with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and rhodamine-phalloidin for 1 h to visualize PLD2 and filamentous actin (F-actin), respectively. To visualize F-actin in COS-7 cells overexpressing GFP, GFP-PLD1, or GFP-PLD2 (36Kim Y. Kim J.E. Lee S.D. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park J.B. Han J.M. Jang S.K. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), they were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin as described above. Slides were then examined under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Because the regulation of PLD could possibly occur through direct interaction between PLD and other binding partners, we started our investigation by looking for cellular PLD2-binding proteins from rat brain extract using purified PLD2 complexed with anti-PLD antibody. After the precipitation (PLD2 precipitate) and protein analysis by SDS-PAGE, we found that the co-precipitate contained major PLD2-binding proteins with relative molecular masses of 48 (p48), 43 (p43), and 35 kDa (p35) and some minor proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, these bands appeared in distinctive patterns only in PLD2 immunoprecipitates. A major band corresponding to p43 in the PLD2 precipitates was excised from the gel for identification by peptide mass fingerprinting. A trypsinized peptide mixture of p43 was then subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Fig. 2Ashows the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrum of the digested peptides of p43. The masses obtained, marked as P1–P7, were compared with proteins in the Swiss-Prot data base using the MS-Fit peptide mass search program. As shown in TableI, the peptides exhibited molecular masses that were almost identical to the calculated masses of the corresponding theoretically predicted tryptic peptides of β-actin. The accuracy of this peptide search result was obtained with 50 ppm, and the analyzed peptides covered 21% of the β-actin sequence (Table. I). To substantiate the identity of this protein further, the presence of actin in the PLD2 precipitate was confirmed using a monoclonal antibody to actin. As shown in Fig. 2 B, actin was strongly detected in the PLD2 precipitate but not in a control immune complex. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the 43-kDa protein in the PLD2 precipitate from the rat brain extract was β-actin.Figure 2Identification of p43 as β-actin.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether β-actin associates directly with PLD2, β-actin from rat brain was purified to over 90% (data not shown) using the methods of Bray and Thomas (28Bray D. Thomas C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 105: 527-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and incubated with the PLD2-bound immune complexes. As shown in Fig.3A, the resulting co-precipitation demonstrated that β-actin interacts directly with PLD2. To identify the PLD2 sequence involved in the β-actin binding, we constructed the GST fusion proteins shown in Fig. 3 B and tested them for their ability to bind to purified β-actin. GST-PLD2 (amino acids 613–723) was found to be the region that most potently bound to β-actin (Fig. 3 C). It seems therefore that the region of the protein encoded between amino acids 613 and 723 may be important for the direct interaction with β-actin. We monitored PLD activity to determine the effect of β-actin on PLD2. As shown in Fig. 4A, the PIP2-dependent activity of PLD2 was inhibited specifically in a β-actin concentration-dependent manner. Using β-actin purified from rat brain, the concentration required for half-maximal inhibition was about 5 nm. To further confirm the inhibitory effect of β-actin on PLD2 activity, we constructed and purified a GST-β-actin for reconstitution assays of PLD activity. As expected, we observed that this GST-β-actin had an inhibitory effect that was similar to that of the β-actin purified from rat brain. To exclude the possibility that the β-actin-inhibited PLD2 activity might be caused by PIP2 sequestration or masking in the substrate phospholipid vesicles, we also performed a PLD2 activity assay in the absence of PIP2. We previously reported that PLD2 could be activated specifically by oleate (18:1) in the absence of PIP2 (26Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, PLD2 activated by oleate was inhibited progressively by increasing either the concentration of β-actin purified from rat brain or GST-β-actin with similar inhibitory potency. The inhibitory efficacy of β-actin, under the condition of the oleate assay, was close to that observed under the condition that included PIP2 (Fig.4 A). Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibitory effect of β-actin on PLD2 might be mediated by direct interaction. In a previous study, we found that α-actinin binds directly to the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–185) of PLD2 and inhibits activity of the enzyme (25Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y Ha S.H. Kim J.H.

To clarify the relationship between the two cytoskeletal proteins, β-actin and α-actinin, in terms of PLD2 binding, in vitro binding assays were performed. Fig. 5Ademonstrates that an increase in β-actin reduced α-actinin binding to PLD2 in a competitive and concentration-dependent manner. In other words, the binding of β-actin to PLD2 induced the release of α-actinin already bound to PLD2. To exclude the possibility that this mode of competition occurs through the same binding site on the two proteins, we used an N-terminal α-actinin binding region deletion mutant of PLD2 (PLD2Δ (1)).

Immunol. 1995; 7: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the expression of intracellular and surface-bound markers. The first cells expressing IgM during this developmental process are the immature B cells. At this stage in their development the B cells translocate from the bone marrow to the spleen (3Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Lentz V.M. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4431-4444PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rolink A.G. Andersson J. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the spleen, B cells are still immature and are distinguishable from their mature counterparts (3Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Lentz V.M. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4431-4444PubMed Google Scholar, 5Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2533-2540PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hardy R.R. Carmack C.E.

Immunol. 1989; 1: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The subsequent differentiation event leads to mature B cells and is characterized by a series of changes in surface marker expression and in the activities of these cells. Only 5 to 10% of the newly generated immature B cells are selected into the pool of long-lived antigen-responsive mature B cells (7Thomas-Vaslin V. Freitas A.A. Int. Immunol. 1989; 1: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Rajewsky K. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 40-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms controlling the selection of immature B cells and especially their differentiation in the spleen are largely unknown. The process of B cell development is controlled by a set of transcription factors, as well as stage- and lineage-restricted genes. Recently several studies implicated NF-κB as a major regulator of the final stage of B cell maturation. Cells deficient in the NF-κB family members, c-Rel and RelA, were found to be arrested at the immature stage (9Grossmann M. O'Reilly L.A. Gugasyan R. Strasser A. Adams J.M. Gerondakis S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6351-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), indicating that these factors are essential for antigen-independent B cell development in the spleen. In addition, IκBα overexpression in B cells inhibited the formation of a mature B cell population (10Bendall H.H. Sikes M.L. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that NF-κB has an essential role in late B cell differentiation. We have shown that invariant chain (Ii),1 a major histocompatibility complex class II chaperone, plays a crucial role in the differentiation of immature B cells in the spleen (11Shachar I. Flavell R.A. Science. 1996; 274: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In mice lacking Ii, the development from immature to mature B cells is impaired, and B cells are arrested at an immature stage characterized by low expression levels of IgD and CD23 and poor response to T-independent antigens (11Shachar I. Flavell R.A. Science. 1996; 274: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Kenty G. Martin W.D. Van Kaer L. Bikoff E.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 606-614PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kenty G. Bikoff E.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we succeeded in disengaging the chaperonin activity of Ii from its role in B cell maturation and demonstrated that Ii N-terminal domain is directly involved in the maturation of B cells. 2D. Matza, D. Lantner, Y. Bogoch, L. Flaishon, R. Heshkoviz, and I. Shachar, submitted for publication. However, at present, the molecular mechanism by which Ii induces B cell maturation is still unknown. Because B cells that are deficient in either Ii or NF-κB family members, c-Rel and RelA, are both arrested at the immature stage in the spleen, in this study, we investigated a possible link between Ii-induced maturation and NF-κB. Indeed, our results indicate that Ii induces maturation by activating a pathway leading to up-regulation of transcription mediated by the p65 component of NF-κB and its coactivator, TAFII105. Spleen cells were obtained from the various mice at 6–8 weeks of age as described previously (15Elliott E.A. Drake J.R. Amigorena S. Elsemore J. Webster P. Mellman I. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 681-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). B cell population was enriched by treating the splenocyte suspension with antibodies against T cell surface molecules (anti-Thy 1.2, CD4, and CD8; Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) for 1 h followed by incubation with low Tox-M complement (Cederlane) for 1 h at 37 °C. The method used was adapted from a procedure described previously (16McMahon S.B. Norvell A. Levine K.J. Monroe J.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 179: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Purified Ii−/− B cells were incubated with 50 µg/ml lipopolysaccharide fromSalmonella typhosa (Sigma). After 48 h, the cells were washed with RPMI medium and transfected with TransFast transfection reagent (Promega) using 12 µl/4 µg of DNA (2 µg of pBabe-puro Ii construct + 2 µg of empty vector or 4 µg of empty vector) according to the manufacturer's directions. The cells were collected after 48 h and analyzed for their cell surface marker expression by FACS analysis. IκB, p65, and p50 constructs were described previously (21Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol.

The percentage increase of IgD+cells was calculated by subtracting the X mean value of IgD+ staining of empty expression plasmid and dividing it to the same X mean value multiplied by 100%. 293 cells (human embryonic kidney fibroblasts) were maintained in F12 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using the standard CaPO4 method. For reporter assay the cells were seeded in a 24-well multidish, using a total of 1 µg of plasmid. Usually, 25 ng of NF-κB or AP-1 reporters were used, together with 500 or 800 ng of Ii expression plasmid, and the total amount of DNA was kept by adding pBabe vector. When Gal4 luciferase reporter was analyzed 5 ng of the reporter and 1–5 ng of DBD fusion plasmids were used (21Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Invariant chain-deficient transfected cells were stained with the 9.1 anti-IgD (Pharmingen) antibody as was described previously (17Shachar I. Elliot E.A. Chasnoff B. Grewal I.S. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 373-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) from Ii−/− primary B cells or from 293 cells. A double stranded oligonucleotide, containing the NF-κB site, was labeled with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I as a probe. The sequence of the oligonucleotide is as follows: 5′ GATCCAGAGGGGACTTTTCCGAGAG 3′; 5′ GATCCTCTCGGAAAGTCCCCTCTG 3′. Spleen B cells from Ii-deficient mice are arrested at the immature stage. We have developed an in vitro system to analyze B cell maturation. In this assay primary immature B cells from Ii-deficient mice can differentiate to mature cells in culture, by introducing Ii expression plasmid (Fig.1, A andB).2 To investigate the involvement of NF-κB in Ii-induced B cell maturation, we cotransfected an undegradable mutant form of IκB, an inhibitor of NF-κB, along with p31 Ii. In addition we introduced the 1–82 Ii fragment (Ii1–82) lacking its lumenal domain. This IκB mutant abolished both p31- and Ii1–82-mediated maturation (Fig. 1 B). As p65/RelA is a direct target for inhibition by IκB and is also associated with the process of B cell maturation, it is plausible that NF-κB p65/RelA is a downstream effector of Ii-induced maturation. If so overexpression of p65/RelA should induce maturation of Ii−/− primary immature B cells. Indeed, p65/RelA overcame the developmental arrest of the Ii−/− B cells and directly induced maturation, and its effect was abolished by dominant IκB (Fig. 1 C). To characterize the specificity of NF-κB dimers in inducing maturation of Ii-deficient primary B cells, we analyzed maturation induction by p50·p65 dimer. In contrast to the p65·p65 complex, the heterodimeric complex, p65·p50, was unable to induce differentiation of B cells (Fig. 1 D). To address the mechanism by which Ii induces B cell maturation via NF-κB, we examined the effect of Ii expression on NF-κB transcription activity. For these studies we used human 293 cells that do not express the endogenous Ii gene. The use of non-B cells for studies of B cell-specific transcription has been shown in many studies to provide valuable functional information for transcription factors and transcription modulators (19Henderson A. Calame K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 163-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A luciferase reporter plasmid containing two tandem NF-κB sites and a minimal core promoter was transfected, along with the expression plasmid for Ii, and luciferase activity was measured 24 h later. As a control NF-κB-mutated or AP-1-dependent reporter plasmids were similarly analyzed. Microscopic examination showed Ii-transfected cells to have the same healthy morphology as untransfected cells. As shown in Fig.2 A Ii enhanced the constitutive NF-κB-dependent activity in a dose-dependent manner (columns 1–3). The NF-κB-mutated reporter displayed negligible activity and was not affected by Ii expression (columns 4–6). The AP-1-dependent reporter gene was not affected by Ii expression (columns 7–9) confirming the specificity of the effect of Ii on NF-κB. As the N-terminal segment of Ii (p31 1–82) is capable of promoting B cell maturation similar to the wild type protein, we next analyzed the effect of this mutant on NF-κB transcription activity. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, amino acids 1–82 enhanced the constitutive NF-κB-dependent activity to the same extent as the full-length protein. Moreover, a construct of Ii lacking part of its cytosolic domain, amino acids 2–17 (Δ 2–17), was unable to enhance this activity (Fig. 2 B). Thus, Ii N-terminal 17 amino acids are important for induction of NF-κB transcription activity. A major pathway for NF-κB activation involves induction of its nuclear localization. To determine whether Ii expression affects this process, nuclear extracts were prepared from 293 cells transfected with either empty or invariant chain expression plasmids (efficiency of transfection was above 80%). These extracts were used in electrophoresis mobility shift assay with an NF-κB-specific probe. Similar levels of nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity were found in control or Ii-expressing cells, indicating that Ii does not induce nuclear transport of NF-κB (Fig. 2 C). The observed DNA binding activity is NF-κB-specific as incubation of these extracts with antibodies against the p65/RelA component of NF-κB resulted in a supershifted complex (data not shown). Thus, Ii stimulates transcription activity of NF-κB through a pathway that is independent of NF-κB nuclear transport. To investigate the mechanism by which Ii controls NF-κB, we examined whether the effect of Ii is directed to the transcriptional activation function of p65/RelA. For this purpose we used an expression plasmid that encodes a fusion of the C-terminal transactivation domain of p65/RelA (TA1) with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4. As a control, the E2A activation domain fused to Gal4 was used. These plasmids were transfected into 293 cells, along with a luciferase reporter containing upstream Gal4-binding sites in the presence or absence of Ii plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2 D, Ii strongly and specifically stimulated the activity of the Gal4p65 but not Gal4E2A fusion proteins. These results indicate that the effect of Ii on NF-κB activity is at least in part targeted to the activation function of p65/RelA. TAFII105 is a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID, which is enriched in B cells (20Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). TAFII105 appears to be present only in a subset of TFIID complexes and therefore is likely to function in the context of specific genes. TAFII105 was shown to act as an activation domain-specific coactivator of p65/RelA homodimers. This function of TAFII105 involves its direct interaction with the p65/RelA activation domain (21Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To examine whether TAFII105 is also involved in B cell differentiation, we employed two dominant negative forms of TAFII 105 lacking the TFIID interaction region (TAFII105ΔC) in the Ii-mediated B cell maturation assay. TAFII105ΔCΔ 452–472 is a double mutant of TAFII105ΔC that is unable to bind p65/ RelA (TAFII105ΔC-ΔNF-κB; see Ref. 22Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of TAFII105ΔC with the p31 or 1–82 Ii fragment abolished maturation (Fig. 3 A). Apparently, suppression of the endogenous TAFII105 activity by the competing dominant negative TAFII105ΔC prevented the maturation process. By contrast, cotransfection of TAFII105ΔC-ΔNF-κB with p31 Ii did not interfere with the maturation process (Fig. 3 A). This result further supports the involvement of p65/RelA and the NF-κB pathway in Ii-induced B cell maturation. Next, we analyzed the effect of TAFII105ΔC on Ii-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity using a luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 3 B Ii-enhanced NF-κB-dependent activity was dramatically inhibited when cotransfected with TAFII 105ΔC. In contrast, TAFII105ΔC impaired in NF-κB binding (TAFII105ΔC-ΔNF-κB) did not interfere with the Ii-induced activity. Together, these results strongly suggest that NF-κB and TAFII105 are directly involved in Ii-mediated B cell maturation. The role of Ii as a chaperone for major histocompatibility complex class II molecules has been well characterized. Recently, we have described a novel role for Ii. In mice lacking this chain, B cell maturation is impaired, and their secondary lymphoid organs are enriched with immature B cells (11Shachar I. Flavell R.A. Science. 1996; 274: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study reveal that Ii is most likely a signaling molecule that regulates this maturation step by inducing a specific gene expression program. Essential elements in this process are the p65 component of NF-κB and its coactivator TAFII105, a subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIID, which is highly expressed in B cells. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, maturation by Ii was suppressed by NF-κB-specific inhibitors, IκB and the dominant negative mutant of TAFII105 (TAFII105ΔC). However, mutant TAFII105ΔC lacking the p65 interaction domain failed to inhibit Ii-induced maturation. Furthermore, we show that p65/RelA could efficiently overcome the B cell maturation block of Ii-deficient B cells. The differentiation induced by p65 is similarly inhibited by IκB and by TAFII105ΔC (data not shown). Interestingly, only p65·p65 but not p65·p50 NF-κB dimeric complexes have the capacity to activate the maturation process, a result consistent with the finding that TAFII105 preferentially associates with p65/RelA homodimer (21Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, these findings indicate that the activity of p65·p65 is not redundant with that of the p50·p65 complex in the regulation of this stage of B cell differentiation. In conclusion, a transcription complex of p65·p65 and TAFII105 is an essential downstream component of a signaling pathway stimulated by Ii that leads to specific gene activation. NF-κB is a family of transcription factors that is activated by a broad range of extracellular signals. A major pathway in regulating NF-κB activity involves its nuclear transport (23Baldwin A.S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). Several studies have characterized additional pathways for inducing the activation potential of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. The activation domain of this molecule was shown to be affected by several signaling pathways including cAMP-dependent protein kinase (24Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), protein kinase C (25Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol.

Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways enhance the activation function of p65. Our experiments show that one possible pathway utilized by Ii involves modulation of the p65/RelA activation domain. We speculate that this event augments the interaction of p65 with coactivator molecules such as TAFII105, resulting in activation of specific genes required for B cell maturation. We suggest that Ii initiates a signaling cascade that is transmitted to the nucleus and activates protein kinases leading to modulation of either the p65 activation domain or its coactivators. The role of p65/RelA in the transition from immature to mature B cells in the spleen is consistent with recent studies showing that c-Rel and RelA play a crucial role in the final stages of B cell development (9Grossmann M. O'Reilly L.A. Gugasyan R. Strasser A. Adams J.M. Gerondakis S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6351-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In that study c-Rel and RelA double deficient B cells, like Ii-deficient cells (11Shachar I. Flavell R.A. Science. 1996; 274: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Kenty G.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar) were arrested at the immature stage. The nature of the Ii signal essential for the maturation, as well as the pathway by which the Ii signal is transmitted to the nucleus, is still open to questions.

It is involved in the allergic responses of 65% of patients suffering olive pollinosis. Ole e 9 (molecular mass of 46.4 kDa) displays 1,3-β-endoglucanase activity (38.9 ± 5.6 mg of glucose released/min × µmol of protein at pH 4.5–6.0 using laminarin as substrate). It is the first 1,3-β-glucanase, a member of the “pathogenesis-related” protein family, detected in pollen tissue. Seven tryptic peptides of the allergen were sequenced by Edman degradation and used for designing primers to clone the cDNA codifying the protein. Specific cDNA for Ole e 9 was synthesized from total RNA and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. The allergen sequence showed an open reading frame of 460 amino acids comprising a putative signal peptide of 26 residues. It shows 39, 33, and 32% sequence identity including the catalytic residues when compared with 1,3-β-glucanases from wheat, willow, andArabidopsis thaliana, respectively.

Accurate diagnosis and efficient immunotherapy protocols are strongly dependent on the use of standardized extracts or well characterized allergen mixtures (1van Ree R. Allergy. 1997; 52: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, allergenic sources frequently contain complex mixtures of allergens from which only a limited number is currently well known. Olive pollinosis is one of the most important causes of inhalant allergy in Mediterranean countries and some areas of North America (2Macchia L. Caiaffa M.F. D'Amato G. Tursi A.

Previous studies have reported the presence of a high number of allergens in olive (Olea europaea) pollen extracts, at least 20 fractions with allergenic activity using IEF1, radioallergosorbent test, and radioallergosorbent test inhibition (5Blanca M. Bulton P. Brostoff J. González-Reguera I. Clin. Allergy. 1983; 13: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Eight olive allergens, Ole e 1–8, with different incidences among the allergic patients so far have been completely or partially characterized (6Villalba M. Batanero E. López-Otı́n C. Sánchez L.M.

All these proteins have molecular masses of <35 kDa (Ole e 1 = 20 kDa, profilin Ole e 2 = 16 kDa, polcalcin Ole e 3 = 9.2 kDa, Ole e 4 = 32 kDa, Ole e 5 = 16 kDa, Ole e 6 = 5.8 kDa, Ole e 7 = 10 kDa, and Ole e 8 = 18.8 kDa). But the allergenic pattern of olive also displays polypeptides of higher molecular mass that have not been explored yet. IgE reactive proteins of 42, 45–47, 60–65, and 70 kDa have been detected in the pollen extract (12Tejera M.L. Villalba M. Batanero E. Rodrı́guez R. J. Allergy Clin.

Some allergens have been biochemically characterized. Thus, cysteine-protease, hyaluronidase, or glutathioneS-transferase are enzyme activities observed for Der p 1, hymenoptera venom allergens, and Bla g 5, respectively (18Chua K.Y. Stewart G.A.

Among pollen allergens, profilins (Bet v 2), defense-related proteins (group 1 allergens such as Bet v 1, Aln g 1, and Cor a 1), Ca2+-binding proteins (Bet v 3, Bet v 4, Cyn d 7, Bra n 1, Phl p 7, and Aln g 4), or pectate lyase (Cry j 1) have been described previously (21Valenta R.

Olive pollen extracts contain profilin (Ole e 2), two allergens belonging to the EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein family (Ole e 3 and Ole e 8), and superoxide dismutase (Ole e 5) (8Ledesma A. Rodrı́guez R. Villalba M. Allergy. 1998; 53: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Batanero E. Villalba M. Ledesma A. Puente X.S. Rodrı́guez R. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, Ole e 1 has been suggested to be involved in the hydration of the pollen during germination (6Villalba M. Batanero E. López-Otı́n C. Sánchez L.M. Monsalve R.I.,. González de la Peña M.A. Lahoz C. Rodrı́guez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The biological function of Ole e 4, Ole e 6, and Ole e 7 cannot be deduced because neither biochemical activity has been demonstrated nor were putative homologous polypeptides found in EMBL/GeneBank/DDBJ databases. The knowledge of the biochemical role of a novel allergen can substantially improve the strategy for its purification as well as its analysis and genetic manipulation, and it can also help to explain relationships between the biological function and allergenic activity (25Dudler T.

Med. 1999; 190: 1897-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Moreover, the analysis of the similarity among homologous counterparts from different sources may suggest the existence of cross-reactivity among allergens from taxonomically related or nonrelated biological sources. Among the protein components of pollens, those specifically expressed in this tissue have been scarcely analyzed. The availability of new well characterized enzymes or their clones should help the studies of the pollen metabolism, germination, and defense mechanisms. 1,3-β-Glucanases (glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.39) are a family of hydrolytic enzymes widely localized in higher plants (27Meins Jr., F. Neuhaus J.-M. Sperisen C. Ryals J. Genes Involved in Plant Defense. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1992: 245-282Crossref Google Scholar). They have been described as belonging to the pathogenesis-related (PR) 2 group of the PR protein superfamily and exist as multiple forms that differ in size, primary structure, isoelectric point, cellular localization, pathogen induction, and pattern of regulation. Although the expression of many 1,3-β-glucanase genes is induced in response to pathogen attack (28Van Loon L.C. van Kammen A.

Finally, active 1,3-β-glucanase has also been found in banana fruit (39Peumans W.J. Barre A. Derycke V. Rouge P. Zhang W. May G.D. Delcour J.A. Van Leuven F. Van Damme E.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1188-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and allergenic isoforms have been described in latex extracts (40Sunderasan E. Hamzah S. Hamid S. Ward M.A. Yeang H.Y. Cardosa M.J. J. Natl. Rubb. Res. 1995; 10: 82-99Google Scholar). We herein describe the isolation and characterization of an olive pollen allergen, Ole e 9, which exhibits high clinical significance. Its identification as an active pollen-specific 1,3-β-glucanase as well as its amino acid sequence is also reported. Olive tree pollen was obtained from Biopol (Spokane, WA) lot No. 97-0524 containing 0.17% foreign pollen and 0.68% other plant parts. The extract was prepared as described previously (9Batanero E. Villalba M. Ledesma A. Puente X.S. Rodrı́guez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The lyophilized saline extract was dissolved in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate and fractionated on a size exclusion Sephadex G-150 column equilibrated in the same solution. Fractions containing proteins in the range of 30–60 kDa were pooled and rechromatographed onto the same column. IgE binding activity of the fractions obtained in all the chromatographic steps were tested by immunoblotting using sera from patients that were allergic to olive tree pollen. IgE-positive samples were applied onto a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl. After a thorough washing, a gradient of 0.5-0.0 m NaCl in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, was applied. A last elution step with distilled water was carried out to remove the allergen. Afterward, Ole e 9 fractions were applied on a Nucleosil C-18 column (RP-HPLC), and the elution was performed with an acetonitrile gradient (35- 60%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar) in 12 and 15% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue or electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Carbohydrate detection of samples transferred to nitrocellulose membranes was performed as described previously (42Batanero E. Villalba M. Rodrı́guez R. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using a biotinylated ConA solution. The staining was developed by horseradish peroxidase reaction as described previously (42Batanero E. Villalba M. Rodrı́guez R. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Protein samples were hydrolyzed at 105 °C with 5.7 m HCl for 24 h and analyzed on a Beckman System 6300 amino acid analyzer. Cysteine content was determined as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation. The pI of the protein was determined by using the Protean IEF system from Bio-Rad according to the manufacturer's protocol. Standard proteins from Bio-Rad (IEF standards, pI range 4.54–9.6) were used to calibrate the strips. After IEF, the proteins were stained with 10% acetic acid containing 0.04% Coomassie Blue R-250, 0.5% CuSO4, 27% isopropyl alcohol. Protein concentration of purified Ole e 9 solutions was measured by amino acid analysis. Total protein determination was estimated according to Lowry et al. (43Lowry O. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular mass determination was performed using a Bruker Reflex II MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer as described previously (44Huecas S. Villalba M. González E. Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Rodrı́guez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The equipment was externally calibrated employing singly, doubly, and triply charged signals from either cytochrome c (12,360 Da) or bovine serum albumin (66,430 Da). Native protein (1–1.8 nmol) was digested with sequence grade tosylphenylalanine-chloromethane-treated trypsin as described previously (6Villalba M. Batanero E. López-Otı́n C. Sánchez L.M. Monsalve R.I.,. González de la Peña M.A. Lahoz C. Rodrı́guez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. An enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/5 (w/w) was used at 37 °C for 3 h. After treatment, trifluoroacetic acid was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 0.1%. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Soluble peptides were fractionated by RP-HPLC on a Nucleosil C-18 column with an acetonitrile gradient (0–50%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. N-terminal Edman degradation of peptides were performed on a 494 sequencer (Applied Biosystems-PE Corp.). Sera from 118 allergic patients, kindly provided by Dr. J. Quiralte (Hospital de Especialidades, Jaén, Spain) and Dr. M. Martı́n-Esteban (Hospital Infantil “La Paz”, Madrid, Spain), were used in this study. The patients fulfilled the following criteria: (i) seasonal rhinitis and/or bronchial asthma from April to June; (ii) a positive skin prick test response to olive pollen extract (ALK-Abelló, Madrid, Spain); (iii) no previous olive pollen immunotherapy. A pool of sera from healthy subjects was included as control. IgE-reactive proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes were immunostained as described previously (7Villalba M. Batanero E.

The membranes were incubated with a pool of sera from patients allergic to olive pollen (diluted 1:10) followed by reaction with mouse anti-human IgE (diluted 1:5000) kindly donated by Dr. M. Lombardero (ALK-Abelló). Afterward, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) diluted 1:5000 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% skim milk. The peroxidase reaction was developed using the ECL Western blotting reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (7Villalba M. Batanero E. Monsalve R.I.,.

IgE quantitation was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in microtiter plates coated with 100 µl/well of protein (1 µg/ml) according to Tejera et al. (12Tejera M.L. Villalba M. Batanero E.

The binding of human IgE was detected by mouse anti-human IgE antibodies diluted 1:5000 followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:5000). Peroxidase reaction was developed using fresh enzyme substrate (12Tejera M.L. Villalba M. Batanero E. Rodrı́guez R. J. Allergy Clin.

Each value was calculated as the mean of two determinations. 1,3-β-Glucanase activity was determined colorimetrically by measuring at 540 nm the reducing equivalents (45Chen L. Fincher G.B. Hoj P.B.

Two determinations were performed for each protein concentration. Glucose was used as a standard. The pH dependence of enzyme activity was measured under the same conditions at pH 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0. Total RNA from olive tree pollen was extracted as described previously (7Villalba M. Batanero E. Monsalve R.I.,. González de la Peña M.A. Lahoz C. Rodrı́guez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15217-15222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 µg of total RNA using the SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) following the user manual. The peptide sequences obtained by Edman degradation were used to design oligonucleotides (Table I), which were included as primers in the cloning strategy (Fig.1). From the sequences, two sense and one antisense degenerate sequences (OL9C, OL9B, and OL9A, respectively) were used in the first step of this protocol. The SMARTTMRACE cDNA amplification kit used allowed the synthesis of a double-stranded cDNA from total RNA using the 3′-RACE cDNA synthesis primer (Table I). This cDNA was subjected to a PCR amplification with the primers OL9C and OL9A, and a fragment of 701 base pairs was obtained, purified, and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector included in the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Based on the sequence of this fragment, a number of nondegenerated oligonucleotides was synthesized, some of them containing several restriction sites were added for cloning purposes (Table I). The same procedure was followed to get the sequences of the remaining PCR products. In the following steps, Ole e 9 3′-end amplification was performed with a gene-specific primer, OL9D, and a nonspecific primer, 3′-CDS, which hybridizes to the adaptor sequence. PCR amplification of the Ole e 9 5′-end was carried out using OL9F and the SMART II primer. The confirmation of the nucleotide sequence of several segments needed the use of the OL9B and OL9E primers. These partial amplifications allowed the design of the primers NTC-OL9, NT-OL9, and CT-OL9 to determine the full-length of the nucleotide-coding sequence of Ole e 9. The DNA nucleotide sequencing was carried out according to Sanger et al. (48Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). Homology searches were performed using the BLAST network based on Altschul et al. (50Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 540-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from different olive tissues (pollen, stem, leaf, and fruit) and from different pollens (Syringa vulgaris, Ligustrum vulgare,Lolium perenne, Fraxinus excelsior, Cynodon dactylon, Salsola kali, and Betula verrucosa) were isolated for olive pollen (7Villalba M.

Membranes were prehybridized with hybridization buffer (Ambion). A 701-base pair fragment, generated from olive pollen cDNA by PCR with OL9C and OL9A primers, was radiolabeled with a commercial random-primed kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This probe was denatured and hybridized to the immobilized RNA in prehybridization solution for 16 h at 42 °C. The hybridization conditions and development of signals were performed following the experimental procedure described previously (7Villalba M. Batanero E. Monsalve R.I.,.

IgE binding immunoblotting assays with the sera from 72 patients that were allergic to olive revealed the presence of a protein band in the olive pollen extract at 45 kDa that was recognized by 44 sera (61.1%). 16 of these positive sera were selected for the immunological assays performed along the isolation procedure of this new olive allergen. Based on these preliminary prevalence data, this allergen would be in addition to Ole e 1 the most important allergen from olive pollen. The olive pollen extract was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography in Sephadex G-150. Fractions containing IgE-binding proteins of molecular mass ranging from 35 to 50 kDa (determined by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and lyophilized. This sample was again chromatographed in the same column to mainly eliminate the dimeric form of Ole e 1 (40 kDa), which interfered in the following steps. The aller"
https://openalex.org/W2092945190,"Many of nitric oxide's biological effects are mediated via NO binding to the iron in heme-containing proteins. Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is structurally similar to heme and is a cofactor for methionine synthase, a key enzyme in folate metabolism. NO inhibits methionine synthase activity in vitro, but data concerning NO binding to cobalamin are controversial. We now show spectroscopically that NO reacts with all three valency states of cobalamin and that NO's inhibition of methionine synthase activity most likely involves its reaction with monovalent cobalamin. By following incorporation of the methyl moiety of [14C]methyltetrahydrofolic acid into protein, we show that NO inhibits methionine synthase activity in vivo, in cultured mammalian cells. The inhibition of methionine synthase activity disrupted carbon flow through the folate pathway as measured by decreased incorporation of [14C]formate into methionine, serine, and purine nucleotides. Homocysteine, but not cysteine, attenuated NO's inhibition of purine synthesis, providing further evidence that NO was acting through methionine synthase inhibition. NO's effect was observed both when NO donors were added to cells and when NO was produced physiologically in co-culture experiments. Treating cells with an NO synthase inhibitor increased formate incorporation into methionine, serine, and purines and methyl-tetrahydrofolate incorporation into protein. Thus, physiological concentrations of NO appear to regulate carbon flow through the folate pathway.

Beutler E. Lichtman M.A. Coller B.S. Lipps T.J. Williams Hematology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Pernicious anemia is characterized by megaloblastic erythropoiesis and is secondary to decreased activity of methionine synthase, one of two mammalian enzymes that requires vitamin B12 (cobalamin) as a cofactor (2Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Methionine synthase catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine via a methylcobalamin intermediate with cycling of cobalamin between the +1 valency state (i.e.cbl(I))1 and the +3 valency state (i.e. cbl(III)) (2Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Methyltetrahydrofolate is the major intracellular storage form of folates, and its synthesis from 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate is essentially irreversible in vivo (2Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 4Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Lue-Shing S. Wong P.W.K. Berlow S. Narisawa K. Baumgartner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Thus, decreased methionine synthase activity leads to trapping of intracellular folates as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and the megaloblastic anemia of vitamin B12 deficiency is virtually indistinguishable from the megaloblastosis of folate deficiency (1Babior B.M. Beutler E. Lichtman M.A. Coller B.S. Lipps T.J. Williams Hematology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by most cell types and regulates a diverse array of biological functions (5Ignarro L. Murad F. Nitric Oxide: Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Therapeutic Implications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995Google Scholar, 6Lloyd-Jones D.M. Bloch K.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). NO has been reported to inhibit methionine synthase activity in vitro (7Brouwer M. Chamulitrat W. Ferruzzi G. Sauls D.L. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nicolaou A. Warefield C.J. Kenyon S.H. Gibbons W.A. Eur. J.

Invest. 1996; 26: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and it might be expected to bind to the cobalt in cobalamin because (i) NO binds tightly to the iron in heme (10Kharitonov V.G. Bonaventura J. Sharma V.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 40-45Google Scholar); (ii) ferrous heme and cbl(III) are isoelectronic; and (iii) in both heme and cobalamin, the metal ion is coordinated to four in-plane nitrogen atoms of a tetrapyrrole ring and has two out-of-plane ligands (3Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, conflicting results have been published concerning NO binding to cobalamin: Bauer (11Bauer J.A. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1998; 9: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that NO binds to divalent cobalamin (i.e. cbl(II)); Brouweret al. (7Brouwer M. Chamulitrat W. Ferruzzi G. Sauls D.L. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that NO binds to both cbl(II) and (III); Firth et al. (12Firth R.A. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Thorp R.G. Williams R.J.P. J. Chem. Soc. 1969; A: 381-386Crossref Google Scholar) found no evidence of NO binding to either cbl(II) or (III); and Rochelle and associates (13Rochelle L.G. Morana S.J. Kruszyna H. Russell M.A. Wilcox D.E. Smith R.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 48-52PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kruszyna H. Magyar J.S. Rochelle L.G. Russell M.A. Smith R.P. Wilcox D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar) initially reported that NO binds to cbl(III) and oxidizes cbl(II) to cbl(III) but subsequently concluded that NO does not react with either species. There have been no studies of NO reaction with cbl(I), but nitrous oxide (N2O), another oxide of nitrogen, inhibits methionine synthase activity by oxidizing cbl(I) to cbl(II), and inhalation of this gas is the most common cause of acute megaloblastosis (1Babior B.M. Beutler E. Lichtman M.A. Coller B.S. Lipps T.J. Williams Hematology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995Google Scholar, 15Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We found that NO reacts with all three oxidation states of cobalamin but that its mechanism of methionine synthase inhibition appears to be similar to that of N2O, i.e. oxidation of cbl(I) to cbl(II). We show that NO inhibits methionine synthase activityin vivo and that NO produced by three different pharmacological agents or produced physiologically by rat C6 glioma cells inhibits carbon flow through the folate pathway. Contrarily, an NO synthase inhibitor increased carbon flow through folates. Thus, the data suggest that NO may modulate folate-mediated one-carbon transfer reactions. Cbl(III)-OH (Sigma; acetate salt) was prepared in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, in a spectrophotometer cell sealed with a rubber septum and deoxygenated by passing argon through the solution for 30 min. Cbl(II) and cbl(I) were produced from deoxygenated cbl(III) solutions using 300 µmdithiothreitol and zinc dust suspended in 10% aqueous ammonium chloride, respectively (16Schrauzer G.N. Holland R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 4060-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Chemically pure grade NO gas (minimum 99% purity; Matheson Gas Products) was passed through 1 m NaOH immediately prior to use to remove contaminating nitrogen oxide species; it was then added anerobically to cobalamin solutions. Similar results were obtained when NO was generated from the NO donor PAPA-NONOate (Cayman Chemical). Absorption spectra were obtained using a dual beam Kontron 860 spectrophotometer. CS-54 rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, which maintain differentiated properties through multiple subcultures, were obtained from A. Rothman (University of California, San Diego) (17Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith W.J. Nadal-Ginard B. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemic cells and baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblasts were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection, and C6 rat glioma cells were obtained from M. Ellisman (University of California, San Diego). All four cell lines were routinely cultured as described previously: CS-54, BHK, and C6 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and HL-60 cells in RPMI 1640 medium (18Scheele J.S.

Unless otherwise noted, experiments were performed using methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 200 µmdl-homocysteine thiolactone (Sigma) and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). This medium, which will be referred to as experimental medium, was used because it allowed optimal incorporation of radioactive label into methionine residues of protein. It contains 9 µm folic acid but lacks purines and pyrimidines, and although cells did not grow in it because of lack of serum growth factors, they were fully viable in the medium for at least 24 h. CS-54 cells were transferred from growth medium into the experimental medium and were shaken gently for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 200 µmPAPA-NONOate or 2 mm N G-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (NAME, Alexis Biochemicals). The cells were then incubated for 2 h with 2.5 µCi of 5-[14C]methyltetrahydrofolic acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 57 mCi/mmol, final medium concentration 53 µm). At the end of the incubation, cells were extracted for 20 min in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid; the extracts were heated to 80 °C for 30 min and cooled on ice for 30 min, and precipitated protein free of DNA and RNA was collected on glass microfiber filters as described previously (21Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity on the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting, and the assay was linear with time from 1 to 3 h and with cell number from 2 to 5 × 106. Rates of methionine and serine synthesis were measured as described previously following [14C]formate incorporation into methionine and serine in protein (22Boss G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J.

Briefly, HL-60 cells at a density of 1 × 106/ml or subconfluent BHK or CS-54 cells were transferred to the experimental DMEM; for the experiments presented in Fig. 7, cells were transferred to DMEM containing 100 µmmethionine, 100 µm arginine, and 0.2% BSA. The cells were shaken gently at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence or presence of 100 µm PAPA-NONOate, 200 µm S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; Alexis Biochemicals), 100 µm S-nitrosoglutathione (GS-NO; Calbiochem), or 2 mm NAME. They were then incubated for 2 h with 20 µCi of [14C]formate (Moravek Radiochemicals; 52 mCi/mmol, final medium concentration 190 µm). The cells were extracted as described above for measuring [14C]methyltetrahydrofolate incorporation into protein, but after heating and cooling the extracts, they were centrifuged at 800 × g; the protein pellet free of DNA and RNA was washed three times in 10% trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 6 n ultrapure HCl, and heated at 120 °C for 20 h. The HCl was evaporated, and the residue containing free amino acids was resuspended in H2O. Methionine was separated from serine by thin layer chromatography in a phenol/ethanol H2O/NH4OH (65:20:20:2) system, and appropriate spots were cut out with radioactivity quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The assays were linear with time from 1 to 3 h and with cell number from 1 to 5 × 106. To be strictly comparable with the above experiments, cells were incubated in experimental medium during measurement of purine nucleotide synthesis; however, as described later, similar results were obtained when the medium contained methionine. In the experiments shown in Fig. 5, homocysteine was omitted from the experimental medium. Cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence or presence of drugs as described above for measuring rates of methionine and serine synthesis, and then rates of de novo and salvage purine nucleotide synthesis were measured as described previously (21Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,25Pilz R.B. Willis R.C. Boss G.R. J. Biol.

Briefly, for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis, cells were incubated with 10 µCi of [14C]formate for 1 h and then extracted in 0.4 n perchloric acid; the cell extracts were heated at 100 °C for 70 min, and the resulting free purine bases were isolated by Dowex 50 ion exchange chromatography. Radioactivity incorporated into the bases was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting, and the data are expressed as cpm incorporated/h/106 cells. The assay was linear with time from 15 min to 2 h and with cell number from 1 × 106 to 5 × 106. To measure purine nucleotide synthesis by the salvage pathway, cells were incubated with 10 µCi of [8-14C]guanine (ICN; 56 mCi/mmol, final medium concentration 180 µm) for 1 h and then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% BSA. The cells were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, and radioactivity in the lysate was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The assay was linear with time and cell number, and we have shown previously that this method follows the incorporation of guanine into guanine nucleotides with <10% of the radioactivity remaining as free intracellular guanine (25Pilz R.B.

To six-well cluster dishes that were either empty or contained ∼1 × 106 rat C6 glioma cells that had been grown to confluence were added 1 × 106 HL-60 cells in 1 ml of experimental DMEM. To half of the cultures was added 10 µm hemoglobin (as an NO scavenger), and after a 30-min equilibration period, the cells were incubated with [14C]formate as described above. Rates of methionine, serine, and de novo purine synthesis were measured in HL-60 cells only by recovering the cells with three gentle washes with phosphate-buffered saline; we showed by cell counting that >95% of the HL-60 cells were recovered and by microscopic examination that the monolayer of C6 cells was left intact. As described previously for other cell types (27Bhullar R.P. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we found in preliminary experiments that C6 glioma cells excrete only a small amount of newly synthesized purines into the culture medium and that the amount of purines excreted was <5% of the amount of purines synthesized by the HL-60 cells during the incubation period. Thus, it is unlikely that the C6 cells contributed significantly to the measurement of purine synthesis by HL-60 cells. To determine if NO binds to cobalamin, we performed spectral studies of NO reactions with all three oxidation states of cobalamin. We found that NO caused a small but definite change in the spectrum of cbl(III)-OH (Fig. 2 a), similar to that found by Brouwer et al. (7Brouwer M. Chamulitrat W. Ferruzzi G. Sauls D.L. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These spectral changes on adding NO to cbl(III) were considered too small to infer NO binding to cbl(III). We therefore confirmed NO ligation to this species by showing that NO-exposed cbl(III) was reduced by dithiothreitol at a rate markedly slower than that of non-NO-exposed cbl(III) (Fig.2 a, inset); thus, a truly unique cbl(III)-NO species had been formed. In agreement with Brouwer et al.(7Brouwer M. Chamulitrat W. Ferruzzi G. Sauls D.L. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found no effect of NO on the visible spectra of CH3-cbl(III) or deoxyadenosyl-cbl(III) (data not shown). To determine if NO binds to cbl(II) and cbl(I), we generated these two species from cbl(III)-OH using dithiothreitol to produce cbl(II) and zinc dust suspended in ammonium chloride to produce cbl(I) (16Schrauzer G.N. Holland R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 4060-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Adding NO to cbl(II) changed its spectrum, indicating formation of cbl(II)-NO (Fig. 2 b); passing argon through this solution yielded back the spectrum of cbl(II). Adding NO to cbl(I) (Fig. 2 b,inset) immediately changed the spectrum to that of cbl(II); a longer exposure yielded the spectrum of cbl(II)-NO. Thus, NO binds to both cbl(II) and cbl(III), and it rapidly oxidizes cbl(I) to cbl(II). As discussed later, the following three observations concerning NO's reactions with cobalamins i.e. lack of binding to CH3-cbl(III), weak and reversible binding to cbl(II), and instantaneous reaction with cbl(I) suggest a mechanism whereby NO inhibits methionine synthase activity. Inhibition of methionine synthase activity in cell extracts and in purified enzyme preparations by high NO concentrations (7Brouwer M. Chamulitrat W. Ferruzzi G. Sauls D.L. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nicolaou A. Warefield C.J. Kenyon S.H. Gibbons W.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Nicolaou A. Kenyon S.H. Gibbons J.M. Ast T. Gibbons W.A. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 26: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) does not predict whether physiological concentrations of NO inhibit the enzyme in vivo. We therefore assessed methionine synthase activity in vivo by measuring [14C]methyltetrahydrofolate incorporation into protein in CS-54 pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. Although this assay cannot distinguish between incorporation of radioactivity into protein directly via methionine insertion as an amino acid residue or indirectly via protein methylation byS-adenosylmethionine, it is strictly dependent on methionine synthase activity (Fig. 1). Using this assay, we found that 200 µm PAPA-NONOate significantly decreased incorporation of radioactivity into protein, from 625 ± 53 cpm/h/106cells in the absence of the drug to 408 ± 43 cpm/h/106 cells in the presence of the drug (means ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate;p < 0.05, Student's t test). Similar results were found in C6 glioma cells. Thus, NO inhibits methionine synthase activity in vivo. Decreased cellular methionine synthase activity should decrease not only methionine synthesis from homocysteine, but because of trapping of folates as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, it should also decrease carbon flow through the folate pathway and thereby decrease serine synthesis (2Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 22Boss G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis, we measured [14C]formate incorporation into methionine and serine in HL-60 human leukemic cells and BHK fibroblasts; as described previously, this assay measures in vivo rates of methionine and serine synthesis and carbon flux through the folate pathway (22Boss G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,23Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We found that three different NO donors, SNAP, PAPA-NONOate, and GS-NO, at concentrations known to have physiological effects (28Fukuyama Y. Mitsudomi T. Sugio K. Ishida T. Akazawa K. Sugimachi K. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Pollman M.J. Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 748-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), decreased methionine and serine synthesis in both cell types (Fig.3, a and b; the effect of GS-NO is not shown but was similar to the other two NO donors). Methionine synthesis was decreased by 75–90% in HL-60 cells and by 70–80% in BHK cells, and serine synthesis was decreased by 70–80% in both HL-60 and BHK cells (Fig. 3, a andb). Neither acetylpenicillamine nor oxidized glutathione, end products of SNAP and GS-NO, had any effect on methionine or serine synthesis. The inhibition of methionine and serine synthesis by the three NO donors was not due to generalized toxicity of the drugs or to inhibition of protein synthesis, because over the course of the experiments, neither cell viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion, nor rates of protein synthesis as measured by [3H]leucine incorporation into protein were significantly affected. Trapping folates as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate should also decrease purine nucleotide synthesis by the de novo pathway, since two steps in the pathway require 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (Fig. 1). We found that the three NO donors reduced rates of de novo purine nucleotide synthesis by 60–75% in HL-60 cells (Fig.4 a) and 45–70% in BHK cells (Fig. 4 b) (again, only the data for SNAP and PAPA-NONOate are shown). In HL-60 cells, PAPA-NONOate inhibited purine synthesis at a concentration as low as 10 µm and exhibited maximal inhibition at 200 µm (data not shown). The inhibition ofde novo purine synthesis by PAPA-NONOate was rapidly reversible; when the drug was washed away from BHK cells prior to adding [14C]formate, rates of purine synthesis returned toward values observed in untreated cells (Fig. 4 b,inset). Although these experiments were performed in methionine-free experimental medium supplemented with 200 µmdl-homocysteine, similar results were obtained when the cells were incubated in experimental medium containing physiological concentrations (i.e. 10–30 µm) of methionine. As was observed in the methionine and serine synthesis experiments, neither acetylpenicillamine nor oxidized glutathione decreased rates of de novo purine synthesis in HL-60 or BHK cells. The three NO donors had no effect on purine nucleotide synthesis by the folate-independent salvage pathway as measured by [8-14C]guanine incorporation into guanylates (Fig.4 b; similar data were obtained for HL-60 cells). The latter data indicate that NO did not decrease the availability of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, the major rate-limiting substrate for purine nucleotide synthesis, whose intracellular concentration is tightly regulated (26Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6054-6059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If NO decreased rates of de novopurine nucleotide synthesis by inhibiting methionine synthase, then measuring purine synthesis in the absence of homocysteine, the substrate of methionine synthase, should increase the potency of inhibition by NO donors. We performed these experiments in CS-54 cells and found, in the absence of NO, an approximate 30% decrease inde novo purine synthesis when homocysteine was omitted from the medium (Fig. 5, comparecircles with triangles). These data are consistent with our previous finding that starvation for an essential amino acid reduces de novo purine synthesis (21Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicate that homocysteine can, at least in part, replace methionine. On adding PAPA-NONOate at increasing concentrations, purine synthesis progressively decreased, both in cells cultured in the absence or presence of homocysteine. However, the two curves were clearly shifted relative to each other yielding IC50 values of ∼70 and 140 µm PAPA-NONOate in the absence and presence of homocysteine, respectively. Adding cysteine, cystine, or homocystine to the medium was without effect (data are shown only for cysteine; Fig. 5, squares). Thus, homocysteine specifically diminished the effect of NO as an inhibitor of purine nucleotide synthesis, presumably by providing substrate and increasing the rate of the methionine synthase reaction. In the experiments presented in Figs.4 and 6, homocysteine was present in the medium, so the observed effects were not secondary to a deficiency of homocysteine. To determine if physiological levels of NO produced by intact cells could have a similar effect as the NO donors on methionine, serine, andde novo purine synthesis, we performed co-culture experiments using rat C6 glioma cells as a source of NO; these cells grow as a monolayer, have type I neuronal NO synthase, and produce NO constitutively (31Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Reis D.J. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We showed, by measuring nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the culture medium (20Idriss S.D. Gudi T. Casteel D.E. Kharitonov V.G. Pilz R.B. Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9489-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), that C6 cells produced NO at a rate of ∼25 pmol/h/106 cells, which agrees with results from previous studies (31Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Reis D.J. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Co-culture of HL-60 cells with C6 cells decreased rates of [14C]formate incorporation into methionine, serine, and purine nucleotides in HL-60 cells by 20–25% (p < 0.05, Student's t test; Fig. 6,a and b). Hemoglobin added to the culture medium as an NO scavenger completely reversed the inhibitory effects of C6 cells on methionine, serine, and purine synthesis in HL-60 cells while having no effect on HL-60 cells cultured in the absence of C6 cells (Fig. 6, a and b). Although rates of NO release by the NO donors are not known in the experiments shown in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, the considerably greater effect of the drugs compared with the co-culture experiments is consistent with their releasing more NO during the experimental period than the C6 cells. To study further the effect of physiologically produced NO on methionine, serine, and de novo purine nucleotide synthesis, we treated CS-54 cells with NAME, a competitive NO synthase inhibitor. These experiments were performed in experimental DMEM containing 100 µmmethionine, 100 µm arginine, and 0.2% BSA. NAME, at a concentration of 2 mm, significantly increased methionine, serine, and purine nucleotide synthesis (Fig.7; p < 0.05, Student'st test, compared with untreated cells). Similarly, we found that NAME increased [14C]methyltetrahydrofolate incorporation into protein, from 604 ± 49 cpm/h/106cells to 728 ± 68 cpm/h/106 cells (means ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate,p < 0.05, Student's t test). NO plays a critical role in many different physiological processes including blood pressure regulation, platelet aggregation, neurotransmission, and macrophage cytotoxicity (5Ignarro L. Murad F. Nitric Oxide: Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Therapeutic Implications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995Google Scholar, 6Lloyd-Jones D.M. Bloch K.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Many of NO's effects (e.g. blood pressure regulation and platelet aggregation) are mediated via NO binding to the iron in the heme prosthetic group of guanylate cyclase, which markedly activates the enzyme and thereby increases the intracellular concentration of the second messenger cGMP (32Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, 33Moro M.A. Russell R.J. Cellek S. Lizasoain I. Su Y. Darley-Usmar V.M. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1480-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). NO has a remarkably high affinity for ferrous heme with a binding constant on the order of 1012to 1014m−1, and NO also binds to ferric heme (34Traylor T.G. Sharma V.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2847-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Iron and cobalt are transition metals adjacent in the periodic table, and the porphyrin ring of heme and the corrin ring of cobalamin are both substituted tetrapyrrole rings (35———— Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology. 10th Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1999Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that NO binds to the cobalt in cobalamin, and we have shown that NO reacts with all three valency states of cobalamin. We used differences in rates of reduction of NO-exposed and non-NO-exposed cbl(III) to infer that spectral changes observed on NO binding to cbl(III), although small and thus dismissed as trivial in some studies (12Firth R.A. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Thorp R.G. Williams R.J.P. J. Chem. Soc. 1969; A: 381-386Crossref Google Scholar, 14Kruszyna H. Magyar J.S. Rochelle L.G. Russell M.A. Smith R.P. Wilcox D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar), are real and reflect NO ligation. Furthermore, we report for the first time that NO reacts rapidly and irreversibly with cbl(I). Further spectroscopic and EPR/FTIR studies showing NO ligation to cbl(II) and cbl(III) will be published separately. We used the well established method of following [14C]formate incorporation into methionine, serine, and purine nucleotides (21Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Boss G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Clin.

Perry J. Lumb M. Chanarin I. Br. J. Haematol. 1990; 74: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to show that NO inhibited carbon flow through the folate pathway in several different types of human and rodent cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells. NO's inhibition of carbon flow through folate intermediates was probably secondary to its inhibiting methionine synthase activity because (i) other workers have shown that NO is a potent inhibitor of methionine synthase activity in vitro (7Brouwer M. Chamulitrat W. Ferruzzi G. Sauls D.L. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nicolaou A. Warefield C.J. Kenyon S.H. Gibbons W.A. Eur. J.

Invest. 1996; 26: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); (ii) we found that NO donors decreased [14C]methyltetrahydrofolate incorporation into protein; and (iii) we showed that homocysteine reduced the effectiveness of PAPA-NONOate as an inhibitor of de novopurine nucleotide synthesis. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that NO-decreased purine nucleotide synthesis by additional mechanisms, e.g. NO, is known to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase (39Lepoivre M. Flaman J. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22994-23000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which could decrease DNA synthesis and thereby cause purine nucleotides to accumulate; the latter could inhibit de novo purine synthesis by a feedback mechanism. At the concentrations used, the NO donors did not appear to exhibit generalized toxicity, because they had no significant effect on [3H]leucine incorporation into protein or [8-14C]guanine incorporation into purine nucleotides. There are at least 16 enzymes that require cobalamin as a co-factor in bacteria and lower organisms, whereas in mammalian systems only two enzymes, methionine synthase and methyl-malonyl-coenzyme A mutase, are known to require cobalamin (3Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating the generation of free tetrahydrofolate from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, methionine synthase is one of four enzymes involved in regulating the cycling of methyl groups between methionine,S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet),S-adenosylhomocysteine, and homocysteine (2Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). AdoMet is the source of methyl groups for a large number of biological transmethylation reactions including those that methylate DNA, RNA, and protein (40Giulidori P. Galli-Kienle M. Catto E. Stramentinoli G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4205-4211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in addition, AdoMet provides propylamine for polyamine synthesis (40Giulidori P. Galli-Kienle M. Catto E. Stramentinoli G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4205-4211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase, the methyl group of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is transferred to cobalamin, generating a methyl-cbl(III) intermediate (3Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the methyl-cobalt bond occurs heterolytically, generating cbl(I), which, because of its highly reactive oxidation state, can be oxidized to cbl(II) (3Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A human methionine synthase reductase has been cloned recently that uses AdoMet to regenerate methyl-cbl(III) from cbl(II) (41Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, the methionine synthase reaction is complex, and because of its importance to several metabolic pathways, it is likely to be highly regulated. Our data suggest that NO may serve as a physiological regulator of methionine synthase, because we found that endogenously produced NO inhibited methionine, serine, and purine nucleotide synthesis and that an NO synthase inhibitor increased [14C]methyl-tetrahydrofolate incorporation into protein and increased [14C]formate incorporation into methionine, serine, and purine nucleotides. There are at least two possible mechanisms whereby NO's interaction with cobalamin could inhibit methionine synthase activity and thus interfere with carbon flow through the folate pathway. First, NO could bind to the methyl ligand binding site of cbl(III), thereby preventing or diminishing formation of the CH3-cbl(III) intermediate in the methionine synthase reaction. Second, NO could oxidize cbl(I) to cbl(II) and therefore interfere with the cbl(I) → cbl(III) cycle that is an essential part of the methionine synthase reaction. We found no evidence that NO could compete with the methyl group in CH3-cbl(III), and the binding equilibrium constant of cbl(II) with RC⋅H2 (where R represents H or deoxyadenosyl) is about 1013m−1 (42Halpern J. Science. 1985; 227: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) as opposed to weak binding of NO to cbl(II). Thus, it appears that direct reactions of NO with cbl(III) or cbl(II) derivatives [(CH3-cbl(III) or CH 3·-cbl(II)] play no significant role in enzyme inhibition. If NO inhibits methionine synthase by reacting with cbl(I), then our data would predict that NO will have little or no effect on the methyl-malonyl-coenzyme A mutase reaction, which involves only cbl(II) and cbl(III) oxidation states. Although NO, like N2O, appears to inhibit methionine synthase activity by interacting with cbl(I), the nature of enzyme inhibition may be quite different between the two gases. While N2O damages the protein by producing ⋅OH radical, with depletion of cobalamin being a secondary cause, NO should prevent only regeneration of the CH3-cbl(III) prosthetic group. NO is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation; therefore, NO is generally thought to be anti-atherogenic (6Lloyd-Jones D.M. Bloch K.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 43Moncada S. Higgs A. New Eng. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5742) Google Scholar). The NO-mediated inhibition of methionine synthesis we observed suggests that pharmacologically administered NO could raise the intracellular (and thus the serum) concentration of homocysteine, and because of homocysteine's known atherogenic properties, NO's effect on the vasculature may be more complex than previously realized (44Welch G.N. Loscalzo J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). In addition, it will be interesting to determine whether prolonged NO exposure, like prolonged N2O exposure, leads to megaloblastosis."

We have studied the effects of the osmolytes sarcosine, betaine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and taurine on the structure and stability of the protein·peptide complex RNase S using x-ray crystallography and titration calorimetry, respectively. The largest degree of stabilization is achieved with 6m sarcosine, which increases the denaturation temperatures of RNase S and S pro by 24.6 and 17.4 °C, respectively, at pH 5 and protects both proteins against tryptic cleavage. Four crystal structures of RNase S in the presence of different osmolytes do not offer any evidence for osmolyte binding to the folded state of the protein or any perturbation in the water structure surrounding the protein. The degree of stabilization in 6 m sarcosine increases with temperature, ranging from −0.52 kcal mol−1at 20 °C to −5.4 kcal mol−1 at 60 °C. The data support the thesis that osmolytes that stabilize proteins, do so by perturbing unfolded states, which change conformation to a compact, folding competent state in the presence of osmolyte. The increased stabilization thus results from a decrease in conformational entropy of the unfolded state. Osmolytes stabilize proteins to thermal and chemical denaturation.

Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12884-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 6Xie G. Timasheff S.N. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Proteins retain activity in the presence of osmolytes suggesting that native state structure and dynamics are not greatly perturbed. However, there is little high resolution structural information available for proteins in the presence of osmolytes. The main classes of osmolytes are sugars, methyl ammonium derivatives, polyhydric alcohols, and amino acids and their derivatives (1Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar). Molar concentrations of all the above classes of molecules have been shown to stabilize proteins. Many organisms accumulate osmolytes under conditions of water stress, such as high salinity, desiccation or freezing. In vivo, amino acid derivatives also counteract the accumulation of urea, which is capable of denaturing proteins. Marine cartilaginous fishes use, as osmolytes, a combination of urea and methylamines, i.e. a denaturant and a stabilizer, in a 2:1 ratio (1Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar, 7Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Lin T.Y. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12695-12701Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Stability studies on RNase T1, RNase A, and other proteins have shown that, if the 2:1 ratio of urea:methylamine is maintained, the methylamine is able to counteract the destabilizing effect of the denaturant (1Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar, 7Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem.

In an effort to further our understanding of the basis of osmolyte stabilization of proteins, we have studied the stabilization of the fragment complementation system ribonuclease S (RNase S)1 in four structurally similar osmolytes, namely sarcosine, betaine, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), and taurine. RNase S is a complex of two fragments, the N-terminal S peptide (S pep; residues 1–20) and the C-terminal S protein (S pro; residues 21–124). The fragments form a 1:1 complex in solution, and RNase S has properties similar to its parent molecule RNase A, in terms of structure (9Kim E.E. Varadarajan R. Wyckoff H.W. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12304-12314Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), activity as well as dynamics (10Chakshusmathi G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Madhu P.K. Varadarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7899-7904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A large number of crystal structures of RNase A, RNase S (9Kim E.E. Varadarajan R. Wyckoff H.W. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12304-12314Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and a number of mutants of RNase S (11Varadarajan R. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12315-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,12Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12365-12374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have been solved to a high resolution. Both fragments of RNase S have been extensively studied. S pep has been studied as a system to understand helicity in a polypeptide chain (13Mitchinson C. Baldwin R.L. Proteins. 1986; 1: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Kim P.S. Baldwin R.L. Nature. 1984; 307: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). S pro is unusual in terms of its folded, stable structure despite being a fragment of a natural protein (10Chakshusmathi G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Madhu P.K. Varadarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7899-7904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Richards F.M. Wycoff H.W. The Enzymes. 1971; 4: 647-806Crossref Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Although S pro is only 104 amino acids long, direct structural characterization by two-dimensional NMR has not been possible because of the tendency of S pro to aggregate at the millimolar concentrations required for NMR studies. S pro has also not been crystallized. Native state concentration-dependent hydrogen exchange studies using two-dimensional NMR have been used to get indirect information on the structure of S pro in its free state (10Chakshusmathi G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Madhu P.K. Varadarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7899-7904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The binding of S pep to S pro is one of the last steps in the folding pathway of RNase A (16Goldberg J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the S pro·S pep interaction is a model system to study protein folding and stability (12Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12365-12374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Connelly P.R. Varadarajan R. Sturtevant J.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6108-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Goldberg J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present work we have examined the effects of osmolytes on the structure and stability of RNase S. There are several advantages of using a bimolecular fragment complementation system such as RNase S, as opposed to a monomeric protein for these studies. The effect of osmolytes on the stability of the individual fragments (models for the unfolded and partially folded states) can be studied in addition to effects on the folded complex. RNase S is easily crystallized, and the structure of RNase S can be solved in the presence of molar concentrations of denaturants (19Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Proteins. 1999; 36: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and osmolytes. The thermodynamics of interaction of S pep with S pro in the presence of osmolytes can be characterized using titration calorimetry as a function of temperature. Thermodynamic binding parameters (ΔG 0,ΔH 0, ΔS, andΔC p) can be measured accurately without extrapolation of the data from high temperature or in the presence of denaturants. RNase A (type XII A), Subtilisin Carlsberg, ammonium sulfate, sarcosine, trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO), betaine, taurine, trypsin (TPCK-treated), andN α-benzoyl-l-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (BAAMC) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Stock solutions of 7 m sarcosine, 5 m betaine, 5 mTMAO, and 0.8 m taurine were made in MilliQ water, based on the solubility of each osmolyte. RNase S was prepared by subtilisin digestion of RNase A and was purified using a 1-ml Resource S column (20Nadig G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Vishveshwara S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). S pro was prepared, purified, and quantitated as described previously (10Chakshusmathi G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Madhu P.K. Varadarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7899-7904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reversibility of thermal denaturation for RNase A, RNase S, and S pro was studied as a function of pH and osmolyte to decide upon the experimental conditions for measurement of protein thermal stability. The S pro fragment at high concentrations (>1 mm) has a tendency to aggregate and precipitate near its isoelectric point (pI = 8.3). Osmolytes were mixed with protein at a single, high concentration of osmolyte (6m sarcosine, 4.5 m TMAO, 4.5 mbetaine, and 0.7 m taurine) at four different pH values (pH 5, 6, 7, and 8). The buffers used were 50 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl at pH 5 and 6, and 50 mmHepes, 100 mm NaCl at pH 7 and 8. Insoluble aggregation of protein (final concentration of 30 µm) was checked by scanning the solution (150 µl final volume) in a Bio-Rad 450 Microplate reader at 450 nm. S pro showed visible aggregation (see Table I) at 20 °C when added to a final concentration of 4.5 TMAO at pH 8. All solutions were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, which were heated in a heating block containing water to 90 °C over a period of 60 min. The solutions were allowed to cool slowly to 20 °C and transferred back to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate, and the aggregation of protein was checked once again. Heating and cooling seemed to enhance the aggregation of S pro in TMAO at pH 8, and aggregation was also seen at pH 7. S pro did not show visible precipitation in buffer alone under these experimental conditions. Visible aggregates were also seen in RNase S at pH 8, 4.5 mTMAO. RNase A, at pH 8, 4.5 m TMAO, also showed aggregation but to a very small extent. Apart from the conditions referred to above, no other well showed significant aggregation of protein. Based on the aggregation profile (Table I) of S pro, RNase S, and RNase A at different pH values, we chose to study the stabilization of the proteins in 100 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 5. This buffer is used for all further experiments unless indicated otherwise.Table IAggregation profile of S pro, RNase A, and RNase S in the presence of osmolytes after a temperature melt (see “Experimental Procedures”)ProteinOsmolytepH 51-aBuffers: pH 5 and 6 (50 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl), pH 7 and 8 (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl).pH 6pH 7pH 8S pro0m1-aBuffers: pH 5 and 6 (50 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl), pH 7 and 8 (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl).√√√√4.5 mTMAO√√xx1-bx, indicates aggregation: xxx, OD (optical density) at 450 nm between 1.0 and 0.8; xx, OD between 0.6 and 0.4; x, OD between 0.1 and 0.2; √, OD < 0.1.xxx1-bx, indicates aggregation: xxx, OD (optical density) at 450 nm between 1.0 and 0.8; xx, OD between 0.6 and 0.4; x, OD between 0.1 and 0.2; √, OD < 0.1.6 m sarcosine√√√√4.5 m betaine√√√√0.6 m taurine√√√√RNase S0 m√√√√4.5mTMAO√√x1-bx, indicates aggregation: xxx, OD (optical density) at 450 nm between 1.0 and 0.8; xx, OD between 0.6 and 0.4; x, OD between 0.1 and 0.2; √, OD < 0.1.xx1-bx, indicates aggregation: xxx, OD (optical density) at 450 nm between 1.0 and 0.8; xx, OD between 0.6 and 0.4; x, OD between 0.1 and 0.2; √, OD < 0.1.6 m sarcosine√√√√4.5 m betaine√√√√0.6 m taurine√√√√RNase A0 m√√√√4.5mTMAO√√√x1-bx, indicates aggregation: xxx, OD (optical density) at 450 nm between 1.0 and 0.8; xx, OD between 0.6 and 0.4; x, OD between 0.1 and 0.2; √, OD < 0.1.6 m sarcosine√√√√4.5 m betaine√√√√0.6 m taurine√√√√1-a Buffers: pH 5 and 6 (50 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl), pH 7 and 8 (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl).1-b x, indicates aggregation: xxx, OD (optical density) at 450 nm between 1.0 and 0.8; xx, OD between 0.6 and 0.4; x, OD between 0.1 and 0.2; √, OD < 0.1. Open table in a new tab Circular dichroic (CD) spectra were collected in a JASCO J720 spectrometer using a cuvette of 1-mm path length. The final concentrations of osmolytes used were 6, 4.5, 3, and 1 m. The 6 m data could be collected only for sarcosine, and data for taurine were collected at a single concentration of 0.5 m. Spectra were collected in the wavelength range of 300–235 nm with a protein concentration of 200 µm for RNase A, RNase S, and S pro. Spectra could not be collected below 235 nm because of the high absorbance of molar concentrations of osmolyte. The temperature denaturation studies (Tm) were done using a peltier cell in the temperature range 10–90 °C. Unfolding was monitored by the CD signal at 239 nm using a protein concentration of 50 µmfor RNase A, RNase S, or S pro. The protein concentrations were based on known molar extinction coefficients for these proteins (17Connelly P.R. Varadarajan R. Sturtevant J.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6108-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Nadig G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Vishveshwara S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RNase S was prepared by mixing S pro with a slight molar excess (1:1.1) of S pep. The S pep used in these studies was the S15 (M13Nle) peptide (21Thomson J. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Sturtevant J.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8587-8593Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Nle analog was used to minimize problems associated with oxidation of Met. The Tm data was fit to a two-component-dissociating system for RNase S (22Catanzano F. Giancola C. Graziano G. Barone G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13378-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Chakravarty S. Mitra N. Queitsch I. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Dubel S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and a two-state fit for S pro and RNase A. Fluorescence spectra were collected on an SPEX fluorometer. The excitation wavelength and slit width were set at 280 nm and 0.1 mm, respectively. Emissions were monitored from 300 to 400 nm with an emission slit width of 4 mm. Each spectrum was an average of five scans. The protein concentration in the cuvette was 10 µm, and the path length used was 1 cm. The buffer was the same as that used for the CD studies. A Superdex peptide HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column attached to the Akta FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was chosen to probe the effect of osmolytes on the conformational state of RNase S and its fragments. The column has a void volume of 7.7 ml and determines the molecular mass accurately in the range 14 to 0.1 kDa. It is, therefore, suitable for characterization of RNase A, RNase S, S pro, and S pep. Minor changes in the conformation of these proteins can be measured using this column. The column was pre-equilibrated with two column volumes (50 ml) of buffer/osmolyte and then run at 20 °C at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1 in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5, with or without 3 m sarcosine. 100 µl of sample (50 µm) was injected in each run. The absorbance was monitored simultaneously at 220, 254, and 280 nm. S pep does not absorb at 280 nm. Sarcosine was chosen for these experiments, because it stabilized RNase S and S pro to a significant extent at 3m, the maximal concentration at which we could work at a reasonable back pressure and flow rate. Proteolytic cleavage of proteins has been used as a probe of protein conformation and stability (20Nadig G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Vishveshwara S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Fontana A. Polverino de Laureto P. De Filippis V. Scaramella E. Zambonin M. Fold Des. 1997; 2: R17-R26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). RNase A is resistant to tryptic cleavage at room temperature, but RNase S and S pro are sensitive to tryptic cleavage (25Allende J.E. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The solution conditions for tryptic cleavage of RNase S and S pro have been described in detail earlier (20Nadig G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Vishveshwara S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cleavage was done at a single concentration of protein (0.1 mm) in 10 mm HEPES, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 8.0, 20 °C. Trypsin was used at a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml−1 in the absence and 0.2 mg ml−1 in the presence of 6 m sarcosine (see “Results”). To separate the effect of the osmolyte (6 msarcosine) on S pro/RNase S from the effect of osmolyte on the activity and stability of trypsin itself, an assay using a fluorescent trypsin substrate (BAAMC) was done in the presence and absence of osmolyte. The assay conditions and BAAMC storage were as described previously (26Ozer I. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The BAAMC cleavage reaction was monitored in an SPEX fluorometer with excitation at 333 nm (slit width, 0.7 nm) and emission at 440 nm (slit width, 10 nm). The assay was carried out at both pH 7 and 8 to facilitate comparison with earlier proteolytic cleavage experiments. Crystals of RNase S of size 0.7 × 0.5 × 0.4 mm were obtained (9Kim E.E. Varadarajan R. Wyckoff H.W. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12304-12314Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and stored in stabilization solution (70% ammonium sulfate, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.75) for a period of 1–8 weeks. RNase S crystals in 20 ml of stabilizing solution were transferred to stabilizing solutions containing increasing concentrations of the desired osmolyte in a stepwise manner by increasing the concentration of additive to the final concentration over a period of 2–3 h. Once at the final osmolyte concentration, the crystals were washed with 20 ml of solution three times (3 × 20 ml) and then soaked in the solution overnight (10–18 h). Crystals were stable in 2 m (but not in 2.5 m) of sarcosine, TMAO, and betaine, whereas for taurine, the crystals were unstable at any osmolyte concentration greater than 0.5 m. The data collection and refinement was done as described previously (19Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Proteins. 1999; 36: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Six data sets were collected. Out of these four was osmolyte-soaked crystals. The remaining two data sets (control-1 and control-2) were in the absence of osmolyte. These were collected on separate crystals but in identical solution conditions. For all six data sets identical data collection, data reduction, and refinement procedures were followed. The relevant data collection and refinement parameters are listed in Table II.Table IIData collection and refinement details of the experimental and control data setsDataCellR merge2-aRmerge is defined as 100 × Σ‖I h − 〈I〉‖/ΣI h, whereI h is the intensity of the reflection h.No. of ReflRes2-bCompletion of the data is based on the shell at which >50% of 2ς reflections are present.

For any parameter X, the ΔX = X control-2 −X control-1 was used as the expected background change of the parameter between two identical data sets. The possibility of changes in the packing density of the polypeptide chain after soaking the crystal in osmolytes was explored by using the Occluded Surface algorithm (29Pattabiraman N. Ward K.B. Fleming P.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 1995; 8: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and by calculating the radius of gyration of the protein. The parameters ΔOS (per residue) and Mean Packing Value were calculated as described previously (12Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12365-12374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,30Ratnaparkhi G.S. Ramachandran S. Udgaonkar J.B. Varadarajan R.

The Δ(Mean Normalized Packing Value) or ΔMP = Mean Normalized Packing Value of soaked structure or mutant − Mean Normalized Packing Value of control. The Normalized Mean Packing Value (29Pattabiraman N. Ward K.B. Fleming P.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 1995; 8: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) is the average of the packing value of all residues of a protein and has been shown (30Ratnaparkhi G.S. Ramachandran S. Udgaonkar J.B. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6958-6966Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to be a useful and sensitive parameter to quantitate the packing density of a protein. Calorimetric titrations were done on an isothermal titration calorimeter from MicroCal Inc. as previously described (12Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12365-12374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Connelly P.R. Varadarajan R. Sturtevant J.M. Richards F.M.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) in the temperature range 6–70 °C. The buffer used was 50 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 5. The thermodynamic parameters (K,ΔG 0, ΔH 0, andΔC p) for binding of S pep to S pro in the presence and absence of osmolytes were determined as described previously (31Varadarajan R. Connelly P.R. Sturtevant J.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Titrations above 40 °C could only be accomplished in the presence of sarcosine. In the case of TMAO and betaine, insoluble aggregation of S pro in the titration cell prevented collection of data. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was done on a Microcalorimeter from MicroCal Inc. as described (32Ganesh C. Shah A.N. Swaminathan C.P. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5020-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). DSC runs were done for RNase A, RNase S, and S pro under the same buffer conditions (pH 5) as the titration calorimetry at a protein concentration of 50 µm in the presence and absence of 6 msarcosine. The Scan rate was 90 K h−1, and runs were done in duplicate with multiple scans for each sample run to confirm reversibility. The S protein and RNase A scans were fit to a two-state model. The data for RNase S was fit to a dissociating system (22Catanzano F. Giancola C. Graziano G. Barone G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13378-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both titration calorimetry and the DSC data were analyzed using the ORIGIN package. Tmin the presence of molar concentrations of osmolytes show that RNase A, RNase S, and S pro are stabilized against heat denaturation in the presence of sarcosine, betaine, and TMAO (Fig. 1 A; Table III). The osmolytes stabilize RNase A, RNase S, and S pro to different extents, with sarcosine having the maximal stabilizing effect in all cases. These osmolytes have been shown to stabilize RNase A in previous studies (3Santoro M.M. Liu Y. Khan S.M. Hou L.X. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5278-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 7Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem.

The largest stabilization for all three systems is in the presence of 6 m sarcosine.

Fig. 1 B shows that in increasing concentrations of sarcosine the near-UV spectra show significant changes, both at 278 nm as well as 240 nm for S pro but not for RNase S and RNase A (data not shown). The increase in the ellipticity for S pro is larger than that observed for RNase S and is specially striking for the positive peak at 240 nm (marked by an asterisk). For RNase A and S, the weak positive band near 240 nm is primarily due to the disulfides (33Kurapkat G. Kruger P. Wollmer A. Fleischhauer J. Kramer B. Zobel E. Koslowski A. Botterweck H. Woody R.W.

In this study, we investigated (a) the roles of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) and ribose 1,5-bisphosphate (Rib-1,5-P2), potent activators of phosphofructokinase, (b) the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of Rib-1,5-P2, and (c) the mechanisms of regulation of these enzymes in H36.12j macrophages during the initial phase of hypoxia. Within 1 min after initiating hypoxia, glycolysis was activated through activation of phosphofructokinase. Over the same period, Fru-2,6-P2 decreased 50% and recovered completely upon reoxygenation. Similar changes in cAMP levels were observed. In contrast, the Rib-1,5-P2 concentration rapidly increased to a maximum level of 8.0 ± 0.9 nmol/g cell 30 s after hypoxia. Thus, Rib-1,5-P2 was the major factor increasing the rate of glycolysis during the initial phase of hypoxia. Moreover, we found that Rib-1,5-P2 was synthesized by two steps: the ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase (5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase; PRPP synthetase) reaction (EC 2.7.6.1) catalyzing the reaction, Rib-5-P + ATP → PRPP + AMP and a new enzyme, “PRPP pyrophosphatase” catalyzing the reaction, PRPP → Rib-1,5-P2 + Pi. Both PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase were significantly activated 30 s after hypoxia. Pretreatment with 1-octadecyl-2-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine and calphostin C prevented the activation of ribose PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase as well as increase in Rib-1,5-P2 and activation of phosphofructokinase 30 s after hypoxia. These data suggest that the activation of the above enzymes was mediated by protein kinase C acting via activation of phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase C in the macrophages during hypoxia.

Lee J.A. Underwood J.C. Harris A.L. Lewis C.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Macrophages are one of the cells, which adapt to low oxygen tension by switching from an aerobic to an anaerobic glycolytic pathway for ATP production (1Lewis J.S. Lee J.A. Underwood J.C. Harris A.L. Lewis C.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 2Kato H. Walz W. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that significant and rapid changes in glycolysis occur during the early phase of hypoxia. Yet, very little is known about either the factor(s) responsible for triggering the early phase of hypoxia-induced glycolysis or the signal transduction mechanisms underlying the rapid adaptation to hypoxia in macrophages.Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2),1the most potent activator of phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11; PFK), plays a crucial role in regulation of glycolysis in many mammalian cells (3Uyeda K. Furuya E. Luby L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8394-8399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A bifunctional enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC2.7.1.1)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.46) (Fru-6-P 2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase), catalyzes the synthesis and degradation of Fru-2,6-P2 (4Sakakibara R. Kitajima S. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 41-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several tissue-specific isozymes of the bifunctional enzymes have been identified in mammalian tissues. They are referred to as liver-, muscle-, heart-, testis-, brain-, and placenta-type (HP2K) (5Uyeda K. A Study of Enzymes: Mechanisms of Enzyme Action. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Boston, MA1991: 445-456Google Scholar, 6Sakai A. Kato M. Fukasawa M. Ishiguro M. Furuya E. Sakakibara R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among these isozymes, HP2K has three unique characteristics. First, HP2K lacks Fru-2,6-Pase activity and possesses only Fru-6-P 2-kinase activity (7Sakakibara R. Kato M. Okamura N. Nakagawa T. Komada Y. Tominaga N. Shimojo M. Fukasawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Second, HP2K is expressed in specific tissues and cells such as placenta, macrophage, and some cancer cell lines (8Sakakibara R. Okudaira T. Fujiwara K. Kato M. Hirata T. Yamanaka S. Naito M. Fukasawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Third, HP2K has phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) on the C terminus (9Okamura N. Sakakibara R. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These characteristics of HP2K are particularly suited for highly glycolytic cells such as macrophages and cancer cells. One assumption is that Fru-2,6-P2 plays an important role in regulation of glycolysis in these cells and HP2K is activated by phosphorylation under hypoxic conditions, leading to the increase in Fru-2,6-P2, which increase activities of PFK and glycolysis. Previously several studies have shown that Fru-2,6-P2 decreased during hypoxia in liver, skeletal muscle, and heart 5 min after hypoxia (10Hue L. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We also reported that the Fru-2,6-P2 underwent a rapid oscillation for 3 min after ischemia in liver and eventually decreased (11Fedorov S. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20826-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears Fru-2,6-P2 is important in regulation of glycolysis in the initial phase of ischemia in liver. The role of Fru-2,6-P2in hypoxic macrophages has not been investigated.Ribose 1,5-bisphosphate (Rib-1,5-P2) is another potent activator of PFK in various tissues (12Ogushi S. Lawson J.W. Dobson G.P. Veech R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10943-10949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ishikawa E. Ogushi S. Ishikawa T. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18875-18878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rib-1,5-P2 is formed during the initiation of the rapid activation of glycolysis and disappears within 1 min in rat brain (12Ogushi S. Lawson J.W. Dobson G.P. Veech R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10943-10949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Rib-1,5-P2 is thought to serve as a trigger to activate the PFK. However, it is unclear whether Rib-1,5-P2 plays a role in hypoxia-induced glycolysis in macrophages. Although, Rib-1,5-P2 can be synthesized from ribose-1-P and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glc-1,6-P2) by phosphoglucomutase (EC5.4.2.2) (14Rose I.A. Warms J.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 59: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in vitro, the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of Rib-1,5-P2 in vivohave not been identified.The aims of this study are to investigate, in H36.12j macrophages during hypoxia, (a) the roles of Fru-2,6-P2 and other factors such as Rib-1,5-P2 in the activation of PFK, (b) to determine what enzymes are involved in the synthesis and degradation of Rib-1,5-P2, and (c) how these enzymes were regulated under hypoxic conditions.DISCUSSIONFru-2,6-P2 is a dominant factor in activation of PFK and glycolysis in various tissues, especially in liver under a variety of conditions (3Uyeda K. Furuya E. Luby L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8394-8399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Uyeda K. A Study of Enzymes: Mechanisms of Enzyme Action. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Boston, MA1991: 445-456Google Scholar). However, Fru-2,6-P2 seems to have a passive role in the onset and during hypoxia-induced glycolysis in the macrophages. In contrast, Rib-1,5-P2 appeared to be the activator of PFK during the initiation of hypoxia for the following reasons: (a) in vitro assays indicated that Rib-1,5-P2 at 8 nmol/g cell was sufficient to activate PFK in the presence of physiological concentrations of other metabolites and activators; and (b) without Rib-1,5-P2, changes in other activators and inhibitors could not account for the 7-fold activation of PFK. This is in agreement with the previous results showing that Rib-1,5-P2is an activator of PFK in brain under ischemia (12Ogushi S. Lawson J.W. Dobson G.P. Veech R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10943-10949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).One of the objectives was to find a pathway for Rib-1,5-P2synthesis and the enzymes responsible for its synthesis. Since adenine nucleotides are degradated during hypoxia (22Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we have investigated the involvement of salvage pathway in Rib-1,5-P2 synthesis. PRPP is a substrate in the synthesis of virtually all nucleotides as well as an important regulator of rates of the de novopathways of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis (23Kim Y.A. King M.T. Teague Jr., W.E. Rufo Jr., G.A. Veech R.L. Passonneau J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E344-352PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PRPP concentration underwent a rapid increase with initiation of hypoxia and subsequently decreased, corresponding identically to the changes in Rib-1,5-P2 concentration. These observations suggested that PRPP might be a precursor of Rib-1,5-P2, and that there might be an unknown enzyme which hydrolyzes PRPP in the reaction, PRPP → Rib-1,5-P2+ Pi. We demonstrated the activity of PRPP pyrophosphatase in macrophage extracts. In addition, PRPP pyrophosphatase was significantly activated under hypoxia (Table II). It is reasonable to propose that PRPP synthetase, which was also activated by hypoxia, and PRPP pyrophosphatase were responsible for the Rib-1,5-P2 synthesis by the following two-step reaction.Rib­5­P+ATP→PRPP synthetasePRPP+AMPPRPP→PRPP pyrophosphataseRib­1,5­P2+PiREACTION1Counter to our proposed synthetic pathway for Rib-1,5-P2, Guha et al. (24Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) proposed the existence of a Rib-1-P 5-kinase, a different synthetic pathway for Rib-1,5-P2. They reported that under hypoxic conditions, AMP levels increased, accompanied by a decrease in the levels of ATP, which might generate increased ribose 1-phosphate and result in an increase in the levels of Rib-1,5-P2 by direct phosphorylation of ribose 1-phosphate (24Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the activity of Rib-1-P 5-kinase and Rib- 5-P 1-kinase were undetected (less than 5 pmol/h/mg protein) in hypoxic H36.12j macrophages. Although, the possibility that these produce Rib-1,5-P2 cannot be denied, PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase appear to be the main synthetic pathway of Rib-1,5-P2 in these macrophages.Although Rib-1,5-P2 completely disappeared within 3 min, PRPP pyrophosphatase remained active regardless of normoxic or hypoxia (Table II). Thus, PRPP pyrophosphatase did not seem to regulate production of Rib-1,5-P2. In contrast to the PRPP pyrophosphatase, PRPP synthetase was rapidly activated under hypoxia and subsequently inactivated (Table I). Thus, the disappearance of Rib-1,5-P2 might be caused by inactivation of PRPP synthetase in the presence of constant PRPP pyrophosphatase, resulting in the decreased PRPP.Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are important mechanisms for early response to various stimuli including hypoxia (25Weissmann N. Voswinckel R. Hardebusch T. Rosseau S. Ghofrani H.A. Schermuly R. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L90-95PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table III, pretreatment with ET-18-OCH3 or calphostin C prevented the increase in both PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase activity after hypoxia, and also prevented the increase in levels of Rib-1,5-P2 (Table III). Furthermore, activation of PFK was blocked by the pretreatment with ET-18-OCH3 and calphostin C that prevented the rise in Rib-1,5-P2 during hypoxia (Table IV and Fig. 8). ET-18-OCH3 is a highly selective ether lipid analogue, which inhibits conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol, which activates PKC (26Powis G. Seewald M.J. Gratas C. Melder D. Riebow J. Modest E.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2835-2840PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). On the other hand, calphostin C inhibits protein kinase C by competing at the binding site for diacylglycerol (28Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Since phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C is activated by short-term hypoxia (29Derevianko A. Graeber T. D'Amico R. Simms H. J. Surg. Res. 1996; 62: 32-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), one possibility to account for the signal transduction mechanisms for Rib-1,5-P2 synthesis is as follows (Fig. 9). Hypoxia activates phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, resulting in the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol binds to and activates PKC. The activated PKC phosphorylates both PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase, which in turn results in the increase in Rib-1,5-P2 and subsequent activation of PFK. It is known that phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C was activated and that diacylglycerol increased by 1 min after hypoxia (29Derevianko A. Graeber T. D'Amico R. Simms H. J. Surg. Res. 1996; 62: 32-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and PKC is activated during hypoxia in various cells and tissues (25Weissmann N. Voswinckel R. Hardebusch T. Rosseau S. Ghofrani H.A. Schermuly R. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L90-95PubMed Google Scholar, 30Simakajornboon N. Gozal E. Gozal Y.M. Gozal D. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 278: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These facts support our hypothesis. Beitner et al. (31Beitner J.D. Leibold J. Millhorn D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1998; 242: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that PKA is involved in mechanisms of adaptation of hypoxia. However, PKA appeared not to be involved in the regulation in the macrophages, since H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, did not result in any changes in PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase activities, and Rib-1,5-P2 concentration was not affected. The discrepancy between the two studies might be explained by the fact that the previous authors examined PKA and PKC activity in long-term of hypoxia. Thus, the signaling pathway for short-term of hypoxia may be different from that for long-term of hypoxia.In conclusion, we showed that Rib-1,5-P2, but not Fru-2,6-P2, may be the major factor causing the rapid increase in the rate of glycolysis during the onset of hypoxia in H36.12j macrophages. We discovered a new two-step pathway for the synthesis of Rib-1,5-P2 in vivo (see Reaction 1). We also found the enzyme activities catalyzing these reactions. We further presented studies with inhibitors, which suggest that the regulation of these enzymes, PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase, in H36.12j macrophages during acute hypoxia resulted from the activation of PKC through phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. We also demonstrated the presence of a phosphatase which hydrolyzes Rib-1,5-P2 to form Rib-5-P in macrophages. The number of macrophages has been reported to increase at hypoxic sites of various tissues and are able to carry out their varied functions in this inhospitable milieu (1Lewis J.S. Lee J.A. Underwood J.C. Harris A.L. Lewis C.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Macrophages are one of the cells, which adapt to low oxygen tension by switching from an aerobic to an anaerobic glycolytic pathway for ATP production (1Lewis J.S. Lee J.A. Underwood J.C. Harris A.L.

Thus, it is not surprising that significant and rapid changes in glycolysis occur during the early phase of hypoxia.

The aims of this study are to investigate, in H36.12j macrophages during hypoxia, (a) the roles of Fru-2,6-P2 and other factors such as Rib-1,5-P2 in the activation of PFK, (b) to determine what enzymes are involved in the synthesis and degradation of Rib-1,5-P2, and (c) how these enzymes were regulated under hypoxic conditions. DISCUSSIONFru-2,6-P2 is a dominant factor in activation of PFK and glycolysis in various tissues, especially in liver under a variety of conditions (3Uyeda K. Furuya E. Luby L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8394-8399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Uyeda K. A Study of Enzymes: Mechanisms of Enzyme Action. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Boston, MA1991: 445-456Google Scholar). However, Fru-2,6-P2 seems to have a passive role in the onset and during hypoxia-induced glycolysis in the macrophages. In contrast, Rib-1,5-P2 appeared to be the activator of PFK during the initiation of hypoxia for the following reasons: (a) in vitro assays indicated that Rib-1,5-P2 at 8 nmol/g cell was sufficient to activate PFK in the presence of physiological concentrations of other metabolites and activators; and (b) without Rib-1,5-P2, changes in other activators and inhibitors could not account for the 7-fold activation of PFK. This is in agreement with the previous results showing that Rib-1,5-P2is an activator of PFK in brain under ischemia (12Ogushi S. Lawson J.W. Dobson G.P. Veech R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10943-10949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).One of the objectives was to find a pathway for Rib-1,5-P2synthesis and the enzymes responsible for its synthesis. Since adenine nucleotides are degradated during hypoxia (22Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we have investigated the involvement of salvage pathway in Rib-1,5-P2 synthesis. PRPP is a substrate in the synthesis of virtually all nucleotides as well as an important regulator of rates of the de novopathways of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis (23Kim Y.A. King M.T. Teague Jr., W.E. Rufo Jr., G.A. Veech R.L. Passonneau J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E344-352PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PRPP concentration underwent a rapid increase with initiation of hypoxia and subsequently decreased, corresponding identically to the changes in Rib-1,5-P2 concentration. These observations suggested that PRPP might be a precursor of Rib-1,5-P2, and that there might be an unknown enzyme which hydrolyzes PRPP in the reaction, PRPP → Rib-1,5-P2+ Pi. We demonstrated the activity of PRPP pyrophosphatase in macrophage extracts. In addition, PRPP pyrophosphatase was significantly activated under hypoxia (Table II). It is reasonable to propose that PRPP synthetase, which was also activated by hypoxia, and PRPP pyrophosphatase were responsible for the Rib-1,5-P2 synthesis by the following two-step reaction.Rib­5­P+ATP→PRPP synthetasePRPP+AMPPRPP→PRPP pyrophosphataseRib­1,5­P2+PiREACTION1Counter to our proposed synthetic pathway for Rib-1,5-P2, Guha et al. (24Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) proposed the existence of a Rib-1-P 5-kinase, a different synthetic pathway for Rib-1,5-P2. They reported that under hypoxic conditions, AMP levels increased, accompanied by a decrease in the levels of ATP, which might generate increased ribose 1-phosphate and result in an increase in the levels of Rib-1,5-P2 by direct phosphorylation of ribose 1-phosphate (24Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the activity of Rib-1-P 5-kinase and Rib- 5-P 1-kinase were undetected (less than 5 pmol/h/mg protein) in hypoxic H36.12j macrophages. Although, the possibility that these produce Rib-1,5-P2 cannot be denied, PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase appear to be the main synthetic pathway of Rib-1,5-P2 in these macrophages.Although Rib-1,5-P2 completely disappeared within 3 min, PRPP pyrophosphatase remained active regardless of normoxic or hypoxia (Table II). Thus, PRPP pyrophosphatase did not seem to regulate production of Rib-1,5-P2. In contrast to the PRPP pyrophosphatase, PRPP synthetase was rapidly activated under hypoxia and subsequently inactivated (Table I). Thus, the disappearance of Rib-1,5-P2 might be caused by inactivation of PRPP synthetase in the presence of constant PRPP pyrophosphatase, resulting in the decreased PRPP.Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are important mechanisms for early response to various stimuli including hypoxia (25Weissmann N. Voswinckel R. Hardebusch T. Rosseau S. Ghofrani H.A. Schermuly R. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L90-95PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table III, pretreatment with ET-18-OCH3 or calphostin C prevented the increase in both PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase activity after hypoxia, and also prevented the increase in levels of Rib-1,5-P2 (Table III). Furthermore, activation of PFK was blocked by the pretreatment with ET-18-OCH3 and calphostin C that prevented the rise in Rib-1,5-P2 during hypoxia (Table IV and Fig. 8). ET-18-OCH3 is a highly selective ether lipid analogue, which inhibits conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol, which activates PKC (26Powis G. Seewald M.J. Gratas C. Melder D. Riebow J. Modest E.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2835-2840PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). On the other hand, calphostin C inhibits protein kinase C by competing at the binding site for diacylglycerol (28Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Since phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C is activated by short-term hypoxia (29Derevianko A. Graeber T. D'Amico R. Simms H. J. Surg. Res. 1996; 62: 32-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), one possibility to account for the signal transduction mechanisms for Rib-1,5-P2 synthesis is as follows (Fig. 9). Hypoxia activates phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, resulting in the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol binds to and activates PKC. The activated PKC phosphorylates both PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase, which in turn results in the increase in Rib-1,5-P2 and subsequent activation of PFK. It is known that phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C was activated and that diacylglycerol increased by 1 min after hypoxia (29Derevianko A. Graeber T. D'Amico R. Simms H. J. Surg. Res. 1996; 62: 32-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and PKC is activated during hypoxia in various cells and tissues (25Weissmann N. Voswinckel R. Hardebusch T. Rosseau S. Ghofrani H.A. Schermuly R. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L90-95PubMed Google Scholar, 30Simakajornboon N. Gozal E. Gozal Y.M. Gozal D. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 278: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These facts support our hypothesis. Beitner et al. (31Beitner J.D. Leibold J. Millhorn D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1998; 242: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that PKA is involved in mechanisms of adaptation of hypoxia. However, PKA appeared not to be involved in the regulation in the macrophages, since H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, did not result in any changes in PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase activities, and Rib-1,5-P2 concentration was not affected. The discrepancy between the two studies might be explained by the fact that the previous authors examined PKA and PKC activity in long-term of hypoxia. Thus, the signaling pathway for short-term of hypoxia may be different from that for long-term of hypoxia.In conclusion, we showed that Rib-1,5-P2, but not Fru-2,6-P2, may be the major factor causing the rapid increase in the rate of glycolysis during the onset of hypoxia in H36.12j macrophages. We discovered a new two-step pathway for the synthesis of Rib-1,5-P2 in vivo (see Reaction 1). We also found the enzyme activities catalyzing these reactions. We further presented studies with inhibitors, which suggest that the regulation of these enzymes, PRPP synthetase and PRPP pyrophosphatase, in H36.12j macrophages during acute hypoxia resulted from the activation of PKC through phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. We also demonstrated the presence of a phosphatase which hydrolyzes Rib-1,5-P2 to form Rib-5-P in macrophages. Fru-2,6-P2 is a dominant factor in activation of PFK and glycolysis in various tissues, especially in liver under a variety of conditions (3Uyeda K. Furuya E. Luby L.J. J. Biol.

Alternative splicing of Prx1 results in two isoforms, Prx1a and Prx1b, whereas only one isoform of Prx2 is produced. The Prx1a and Prx1b proteins have identical amino acids from 1 through 199, whereas their carboxyl termini are completely different. The carboxyl tail of Prx1a (amino acids 200–245) contains an evolutionarily conserved domain (OAR) present in at least 40 other members of the paired class (1Galliot B. de Vargas C. Miller D. Dev. Genes Evol. 1999; 209: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This domain is not encoded in the carboxyl terminus of Prx1b (200), making Prx1 the only murine homeobox gene that encodes an OAR domain in one isoform (Prx1a), but not in the second isoform (Prx1b). The function of the OAR domain is not well understood; however, three proteins with an OAR domain have been examined. In the Prx2 and Pitx2 homeoproteins, the OAR domain has been defined as inhibiting transactivation (6Norris R.A. Scott K.K. Moore C.S. Stetten G. Brown C.R. Jabs E.W. Wulfsberg E.A., Yu, J. Kern M.J.

Very little is known about the expression pattern of the two isoforms of Prx1. Although the Prx1a and Prx1b transcripts appear to be coexpressed in the limited mice and human tissues examined, there are dramatic tissue-specific differences in the ratio of these two mRNAs in human tissue (5Kern M.J.

The transcripts of Prx1and Prx2 are expressed primarily in mesoderm within regions of undifferentiated mesenchyme during embryogenesis, particularly in the ectomesenchyme of the craniofacial region and branchial arches, as well as mesenchymal cells of the developing limbs and cardiac cushions. Although Prx1 and Prx2 appear to be down-regulated during chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, expression of both is retained in the perichondrium and the periosteum (9Kuratani S. Martin J.F. Wawersik S.

The function of the Prx genes was investigated by creating null alleles in embryonic stem cells.The gene-targeted mice have demonstrated the developmental importance of Prx1 and Prx2(16Tenberge D.

Prx1-gene targeted mice die perinatally with a host of craniofacial and limb malformations. In contrast,Prx2 gene-targeted mice are morphologically normal. The double mutant mice (Prx1−/− Prx2−/−) developed more severe manifestations of the Prx1−/− phenotype, as well as novel craniofacial, limb, and vascular defects indicating functional compensation between these two loci. However, this compensation is unequal. Prx1 +/− Prx2−/− mice are morphologically normal demonstrating that only one allele of Prx1 is necessary to compensate for the lack of Prx2. The opposite is not true because one Prx2 allele on a Prx1 null background only decreases the severity of some malformations while completely rescuing others (16Tenberge D. Brouwer A. Korving J. Martin J.F. Meijlink F. Development. 1998; 125: 3831-3842PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bergwerff M. Gittenberger-de Groot A.C. Wisse L.J. DeRuiter M.C. Wessels A. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Kern M.J.

The mechanism underlying this unequal functional redundancy is not understood. A better understanding of how Prx1 and Prx2 proteins regulate transcription should provide insight into their biochemical function as well as this unequal compensation. Recently, we have identified important transcription regulatory regions in the Prx2 homeoprotein (6Norris R.A. Scott K.K. Moore C.S. Stetten G. Brown C.R. Jabs E.W. Wulfsberg E.A., Yu, J. Kern M.J. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To examine similarities and differences between the transcription factors encoded by the Prx1 andPrx2 loci, this study focuses on defining functional domains within the Prx1a and Prx1b homeoproteins. These data demonstrate that Prx1a and Prx2 are very similar and functionally different from Prx1b. Based on these experiments and our previous analysis of Prx2, we propose a mechanism for the unequal functional compensation between thePrx1 and Prx2 loci. All deletion mutants of the Prx1 protein were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 amplification with Q-Taq polymerase (Qiagen) and full-length mousePrx1a and Prx1b as the templates. The oligomers used terminated at nucleotides that encoded the Prx1 amino acids at positions 1, 28, 45, 78, 167, 199, 216, and 245 within the open reading frame. The PCR- amplified products were subcloned into the pCDNA3.1+ His (Invitrogen) downstream and in-frame with the start and histidine (6X) codons. Prx1 OAR mutations were generated by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Plasmids expressing the Gal4-Prx1 fusion proteins were generated by subcloning a PCR-amplified Gal4(1–147) DNA binding domain (DBD) into the expression plasmid pCDNA3.1+. PCR-generated pieces of Prx1 were inserted downstream and in-frame of the Gal4 DBD. The oligomers used to make the Prx1 pieces terminated at nucleotides that encoded the Prx1 amino acids 1, 93, 153, 216, and 245. The Prx1a-Pitx2 chimeric construct was generated by PCR using primers that terminated at 1 and 216 for Prx1a as well as 274 and 317 for Pitx2 (Swissprot P97474). The Gal4, tenascin-c, and Prx reporters were made as reported previously (6Norris R.A. Scott K.K. Moore C.S. Stetten G. Brown C.R. Jabs E.W. Wulfsberg E.A., Yu, J. Kern M.J. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All Prx1 expression constructs were derived from pCDNA3.1+ His, which contains a T7 promoter upstream from the insert. Constructs were transcribed and translated in vitro with the transcription and translation (TnT) kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled ([35S]methionine) Prx1 truncation mutants were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For DNA binding reactions, 4 µl of nonlabeled TnT-produced Prx1 truncation mutants were incubated for 10 min on ice with a 1 × electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) buffer (21Qu S.M. Tucker S.C. Zhao Q. deCrombrugghe B. Wisdom R. Development. 1999; 126: 359-369PubMed Google Scholar) and 500 ng of poly(dI-dC). Exactly 50,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled Prx binding site were added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 10 min. Reactions were run on a 4% stacking and 7.5% separating polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat). For affinity binding assays, TnT-produced Prx1 proteins were quantitated. Known amounts of purified Prx1 protein were used as a standard against dilutions of each TnT-produced Prx1 truncation mutant. Protein samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection was performed using an anti-Prx1 antibody. 2E. Chesterman and M. Kern, manuscript in preparation. Gel shift reactions were incubated on ice for 10 min and contained equimolar amounts of each truncated Prx1 protein, EMSA buffer (21Qu S.M. Tucker S.C. Zhao Q. deCrombrugghe B. Wisdom R. Development. 1999; 126: 359-369PubMed Google Scholar), and 500 ng of poly(dI-dC). For association analysis, increasing amounts of a 32P-labeled Prx consensus binding site (100, 200, 400, 800, 1,200, and 1,600 pg) were added and incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel containing three regions of different percentages as described previously (6Norris R.A. Scott K.K. Moore C.S. Stetten G. Brown C.R. Jabs E.W. Wulfsberg E.A., Yu, J. Kern M.J. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All gels were dried and exposed together on the same PhosphorImaging cassette (Molecular Dynamics). Densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Image software, and values were obtained for bound and free probe areas. For each EMSA, a slope corresponding to the binding avidity/stability was determined based on the nmamount of bound oligo versus free oligo. The slopes generated for each truncation were compared against the slope obtained for the 1–245 construct. All Gal4-Prx1 expression constructs were derived from pCDNA3.1+, which contains a T7 promoter upstream of the insert. Constructs were transcribed and translated in vitro with the TnT kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gal4-Prx1 fusion proteins produced in TnT reactions were evaluated by Western and EMSA analyses and were performed as described previously (6Norris R.A. Scott K.K. Moore C.S. Stetten G. Brown C.R. Jabs E.W. Wulfsberg E.A., Yu, J. Kern M.J. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All plasmids used for transfection were purified using the Endo-Free Maxi-prep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Procedures for maintenance of NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells as well as transfection assays were performed as described previously (6Norris R.A. Scott K.K. Moore C.S. Stetten G. Brown C.R. Jabs E.W. Wulfsberg E.A., Yu, J. Kern M.J. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate using 35-mm dishes; the results were averaged and then repeated a minimum of three times. The pSV-βGal vector (Promega) was used to normalize the results. The Prx1 proteins contain a number of regions that are conserved with other proteins (Fig. 1). These domains are identified solely on their amino acid sequence except for the homeodomain, which has been functionally examined in terms of DNA binding specificity (3Cserjesi P. Lilly B. Bryson L. Wang Y. Sassoon D.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1992; 115: 1087-1101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its homeodomain, Prx1a contains two other highly conserved regions, the Prx domain and the OAR domain. The Prx domain is only observed in the Prx1a, Prx1b, and Prx2 proteins, whereas the carboxyl OAR domain is present in many other paired type homeoproteins. Prx1a and Prx2 contain the OAR domain, whereas Prx1b does not. Splicing of Prx1 primary transcripts incorporates a fourth exon that codes for 18 different amino acids (200). This splicing also alters the alanine percentage in the carboxyl tail from 14% to 6% while not altering the high percentage of prolines and serines. Regions amino to the Prx1 homeodomain contain a high percentage of alanines, glycines, and serines (Fig. 1). Predominance of these residues is associated with transcription regulatory regions in other proteins (6Norris R.A. Scott K.K. Moore C.S. Stetten G. Brown C.R. Jabs E.W. Wulfsberg E.A., Yu, J.

To assess the ability of specific domains contained within the Prx1 protein to mediate transcription regulation, a series of truncation mutants was generated based on the domains described above. These expression plasmids were sequenced and then analyzed in vitro to ensure that proteins of the appropriate size were generated (data not shown). Radiolabeled TnT-produced proteins were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ability of each protein to bind a Prx consensus DNA sequence was evaluated by EMSA (data not shown). All Prx1 truncation mutants bound this DNA sequence, demonstrating that they were folded sufficiently to retain this function. The transcription regulatory properties of each truncation mutant were examined in eukaryotic cells. Transient cotransfection assays were performed using a plasmid containing the SV40 early promoter driving luciferase expression. Three Prx-responsive elements (3X PRE) were inserted immediately upstream of the SV40 promoter. Cotransfection of this reporter and full-length Prx1a into NIH3T3 cells resulted in essentially no change of luciferase gene transcription relative to base line (Fig. 1). Similarly, as the amino end of Prx1a was removed (constructs 28–245 and 78–245), very little if any change was detectable in reporter activation. However, when the carboxyl 29 amino acids were removed (1), a 10-fold increase in gene activity was observed, suggesting that this region functions as an inhibition or repressor domain. The carboxyl region containing the OAR domain likely functions as an inhibitor because any construct that contains it has very low activity (1–245, 28–245, and 78–245), whereas those without it (1–216 and 1–167) have higher activity. There were two other important regions identified by this assay. First, an activation domain is present in the carboxyl portion of the protein between amino acids 168 and 216 (compare 1–216 with 1–167). Second, the amino region of the Prx1a protein also activated transcription (compare 1–167 with 78–167). Finally, it should be noted that expression of full-length Prx1b functioned in a manner similar to the full-length Prx1a isoform in NIH3T3 cells with very little change in reporter gene activity compared with base line. Prx1 transcripts are highly expressed in embryonic and adult skeletal muscle (3Cserjesi P. Lilly B. Bryson L. Wang Y. Sassoon D.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1992; 115: 1087-1101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kern M.J. Witte D.P. Valerius M.T. Aronow B.J. Potter S.S.

Genome. 2000; 11: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose C2C12 myoblasts as a second cell line to examine the transcription regulatory properties of the Prx1 proteins. It should also be noted that Prx1 transcripts are present in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells (9Kuratani S. Martin J.F. Wawersik S. Lilly B. Eichele G. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Leussink B. Brouwer A. Elkhattabi M. Poelmann R.E. Gittenberger-degroot A.C. Meijlink F. Mech.

Biol. 1993; 158: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); C2C12 cells can be stimulated to undergo differentiation into osteoblasts and may be more mesenchymal-like than thought previously (27Okubo Y. Bessho K. Fujimura K. Iizuka T. Miyatake S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The transcription regulatory activity of the Prx1 protein and truncations was very different in C2C12 cells compared with NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1). In the C2C12 cell line, Prx1a repressed transcription 2.7-fold. A similar level of repression was demonstrated when the first 27 amino acids were removed (28). Less repression was evident when the first 77 amino acids were removed (78). The repression effect of Prx1 in C2C12 cells was completely overcome through the removal of the carboxyl terminus (1) and resulted in a 2-fold activation of transcription. The identical activity of truncations 78–245 and 78–167 suggests that the OAR domain is likely masking activation domains, similar to the results in NIH3T3 cells. Like the results in NIH3T3, a carboxyl activation domain was mapped within amino acids 168–216 (examine 1–216 and 1–167). In comparing the two cell lines, activation of transcription is predominant in NIH3T3 cells, whereas repression is more prevalent in the C2C12 cells. Furthermore, there is at least one regulatory activity in the amino end (28–77) of Prx1a which is functioning in C2C12 but not NIH3T3 cells. The Prx1b isoform was examined for its ability to regulate the 3X PRE-SV40 promoter in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1). A significantly higher level of repression was demonstrated for Prx1b compared with Prx1a. This result was cell-specific because there was no detectable difference in transcription regulation between the Prx1a and Prx1b isoforms in NIH3T3 cells. Because other homeoproteins have been described as being able to regulate gene transcription independent of DNA binding (6Norris R.A. Scott K.K. Moore C.S. Stetten G. Brown C.R. Jabs E.W. Wulfsberg E.A., Yu, J. Kern M.J. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Catron K.M. Wang H.Y. Hu G.H. Shen M.M. Abateshen C. Mech.

Biol. 1995; 15: 861-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is important to determine if Prx1 can also function this way. To test if DNA binding was essential, the constructs that gave the highest levels of transcription activity in NIH3T3 cells (1–216 and 1–167) were used in a cotransfection assay. These expression constructs were cotransfected with a reporter containing either Prx binding sites (3X PRE) or Gal4 binding sites (5X GAL4). Both Prx1 truncations are able to activate transcription to approximately the same level in the presence or absence of DNA-binding elements (Fig.2). To examine further the function of Prx1 domains involved in transcription regulation, expression constructs were generated which fused the Gal4 DBD with portions of the Prx1 protein. The constructs were sequenced, and the ability of these chimeric proteins to bind a Gal4 recognition sequence was evaluated by EMSA. All of the fusion proteins bound to this element, demonstrating that they were likely folded normally (data not shown). The chimeric Prx1 proteins were tested for their ability to regulate transcription by transient cotransfection assays in NIH3T3 cells (Fig.3). The Gal4-Prx1 1–245 construct repressed transcription ∼2-fold (data not shown). Removal of the carboxyl tail (construct 1–216) relieved this repressing effect and activated transcription 2-fold over base line. This demonstrated that the Gal4 DBD blunted the level of Prx1a transcription activation domains. However, these results were consistent with earlier data (compare with Figs. 1 and 2). Like the previous DNA-dependent transfection results, these results suggested that the carboxyl terminus contained either a repressor or a masking domain. The function of the carboxyl tail was examined further by fusing the last 29 amino acids of Prx1a to the Gal4 DBD. This chimeric protein did not activate or repress the reporter gene. When the entire carboxyl region of the Prx1 protein (153) was fused to the Gal4 DBD, luciferase activity was also maintained at basal levels. However, when the carboxyl terminus was removed (153), the activation doubled. Furthermore when this was trimmed to 153–199 the activation disappeared. In toto, these data indicate that not only is there an activation domain in the 200–216 region but that the 29 most terminal amino acids, a region that contains the OAR domain, masks transcription activation domains. The carboxyl terminus of the Prx1b protein was also examined with this approach. Fusion of the last 18 amino acids (200) to the Gal4 DBD resulted in base-line levels of transcription activity. When a larger portion of the Prx1b carboxyl region was examined (153), more than 2-fold repression was observed. The 153–"
https://openalex.org/W2041819287,"AP-2 transcription factors execute important functions during embryonic development and malignant transformation. Recently, we have isolated a transcriptional repressor of AP-2alpha expression, the novel Kruppel-related zinc finger protein AP-2rep (Klf12). Here, we show that repression of AP-2alpha transcription by AP-2rep is dependent on an N-terminal PVDLS motif that interacts specifically with the corepressor CtBP1 both in vivo and in vitro. This interaction motif was previously identified in the C-terminal region of the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A. Infection of both HeLa and PA-1 cells with adenovirus type 5 strongly induced AP-2alpha mRNA. Consistently, E1A was necessary and sufficient to mediate up-regulation of AP-2alpha. Transiently transfected wild-type E1A protein activated an AP-2rep sensitive cis-regulatory element of the AP-2alpha promoter, but E1A protein harboring a mutation in the PVDLS motif failed to activate. In summary, we conclude that the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A activates transcription from the endogenous AP-2alpha gene, an effect that involves transcriptional derepression of the AP-2alpha promoter by interaction of E1A with the AP-2rep corepressor CtBP1."

We used cultures of rat renal mesangial cells to study the regulation of EGF receptors (EGFRs) by various endogenous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs (5-hydroxytryptamine2A, lysophosphatidic acid, angiotensin AT1, bradykinin B2) were shown to transactivate EGFRs through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. This transactivation resulted in the initiation of multiple cellular signals (phosphorylation of the EGFRs and ERK and activation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), NF-κB, and E2F), as well as subsequent rapid down-regulation of cell-surface EGFRs and internalization and desensitization of the EGFRs without change in the total cellular complement of EGFRs. Internalization of the EGFRs and the down-regulation of cell-surface receptors in mesangial cells were blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and in HEK293 cells by transfection of cDNA constructs that encode dominant negative β-arrestin-1 or dynamin. Whereas all of the effects of GPCRs on EGFRs were dependent to a great extent on protein kinase C, those initiated by EGF were not. These studies demonstrate that GPCRs can induce multiple signals through protein kinase C-dependent transactivation of EGFRs.

Cross-talk can take the form of using shared signaling pathways (1Piiper A. Stryjek-Kaminska D. Zeuzem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1276-G1284PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ramirez I. Tebar F. Grau M.

Thus, contrary to relatively recent dogma, it is now abundantly clear that RTKs and GPCRs engage in extensive cross-talk with each other. Just as there are similarities in the mechanisms that initiate the signaling pathways of GPCRs and RTKs, there might also be similarities in the mechanisms by which those signals are terminated or desensitized. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence that GPCRs and RTKs share mechanisms that regulate signal desensitization. Desensitization is a group of processes through which receptors or components of their signaling pathways become less responsive after previous exposures to receptor ligands. Homologous desensitization occurs when cells become unresponsive only to subsequent activation of the receptor that was previously stimulated. This type of desensitization is usually mediated by receptor specific kinases (GRKs). Heterologous desensitization refers to attenuation of one receptor system by another and is usually mediated by broad spectrum serine/threonine kinase such as protein kinases C and A. A special form of heterologous desensitization may occur when RTKs desensitize GPCRs. RTKs can desensitize GPCRs by phosphorylating the GPCR (13Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Gelman M.S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by phosphorylating heterotrimeric G proteins (14Leibmann C. Graness A. Boehmer A. Kovalenko M. Adomeit A. Steinmetzer T. Nurnberg B. Wetzker R. Boehmer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31098-31105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or by other mechanisms (15Lamm M. Rajagopalan-Gupta R.

Life Sci. 1998; 63: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It is also possible that GPCRs could desensitize RTKs, but little is known about this phenomenon. Renal mesangial cells possess many mitogenic GPCRs, including angiotensin II AT1A (17Schlondorff D. DeCandido S. Satriano J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C113-C120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), bradykinin B2 (18El-Dahr S.S. Dipp S. Baricos W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F343-F352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Jaffa A.A.

Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2A) receptors (22Nebigil C.G. Garnovskaya M.N. Spurney R.F. Raymond J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F122-F127PubMed Google Scholar). Mesangial cells also express RTKs, which may participate in the proliferative phase of chronic renal failure (23Floege J. Eng E. Young B.A. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1993; 39: S47-S54PubMed Google Scholar) or in the recovery from renal failure (24Ranieri E. Gesualdo L. Petrarulo F. Schena F.P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1990-2001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells possess an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (25Takemura T. Murata Y. Hino S. Okada M. Yanagida H. Ikeda M. Yoshioka K. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that stimulates proliferative cascades in those cells (26Ghosh Choudhury G. Jin D.C. Kim Y. Celeste A. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Abboud H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is somewhat paradoxical that mesangial cells should express so many mitogenic receptors in that, under normal circumstances, proliferation is highly restrained within the confines of the glomerulus. This suggests that the responsiveness of mitogenic receptors must be rigidly controlled in mesangial cells. One mechanism through which rigid control of mitogenic signaling in mesangial cells might be exercised is desensitization. In this study, we report that pretreatment of kidney mesangial cells with GPCR ligands (5-HT, bradykinin, lysophosphatidic acid) results in a PKC-dependent transactivation of EGFR followed by a profound decrease in the ability of EGF to initiate multiple signals including autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR), phosphorylation of ERK, and regulation of transcription factor activities (NF-κB, E2F, CREB). Furthermore, the desensitization pathway involves PKC and results in a dramatic internalization of native EGF receptors and transfected EGFR-GFP fusion proteins. Thus, preconditioning of cells by GPCR ligands may be a novel method to abrogate deleterious signals initiated by EGFR and other RTK. Drugs and reagents were obtained from the following sources. 5-HT, bradykinin, lysophosphatidic acid, epidermal growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were from Sigma. Phospho-ERK antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) and protease inhibitors (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, EDTA, E-64, leupeptin, and aprotinin) were from Calbiochem. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99), protein A-agarose, and E2F oligonucleotides were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). NF-κB and CREB oligonucleotides were from Promega (Madison, WI). Rat renal mesangial cells were obtained from cortical sections of kidneys from young 100–150-gram Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats using standard sieving techniques (27Grewal J.S. Mukhin Y.V. Garnovskaya M.N. Raymond J.R. Greene E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F922-F930PubMed Google Scholar). The kidneys were harvested in accordance with a protocol reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Medical University of South Carolina. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 and were subcultured every 1–2 weeks by trypsinization until a pure culture of mesangial cells was obtained. These cells were plated at a density of 2–5 × 104cells/ml in RPMI medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin). Cells used were from passages 6–16. HEK293 cells were maintained in F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 µg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfections were performed on 50–70% confluent monolayers in 100-mm dishes, using LipofectAMINE, Lipofectin (Life Technologies), or FuGene™ 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Empty vectors were added to transfections to keep the total mass of DNA added per dish constant within experiments. 48 h prior to studies, cells were placed in serum-free medium supplemented with antibiotics and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells (∼1 × 107) were grown in 100-mm culture dishes, washed twice with phosphate-free buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl), and incubated in phosphate-free RPMI medium supplemented with 20 mmdextrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 100 µCi of [32P]phosphoric acid for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with mitogens for 3 min with or without pretreatment with inhibitors 30 min before stimulation. Cells were placed on ice, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 500 µm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 500 µm EDTA, 1 µm E-64, 1 µmleupeptin, and 1 µg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were rocked at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged to remove insoluble debris. The lysates were then diluted to a protein concentration of 1–2 mg/ml, and 500 µl was used for immunoprecipitation using 5 µg of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. The mixture was rocked for 1 h at 4 °C, then 20 µl of protein A- or protein G/A-agarose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated on a rocker for another 20 min at 4 °C. The immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation, washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and then dissociated from the agarose beads by adding Laemmli buffer. The samples were heated to 90 °C for 2 min and then loaded onto precast 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego) and resolved under nonreducing conditions. The gels were dried and analyzed with a PhosphorImager. ERK immunoblots were performed essentially as described previously (28Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y. Raymond J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The phospho-ERK antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution, whereas the control antibody, which recognizes equally well the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase, was used at a 1:500 dilution as per the manufacturers recommendations. After treatment, cells were scraped into Laemmli buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions with 4–20% pre-cast gels (Novex). After semi-dry transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the membranes were blocked with a BLOTTO buffer (5% defatted dried milk in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, pH 8.0). The membranes were incubated overnight with the BLOTTO containing the phospho-ERK antibody. The membranes were washed, then exposed to goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG (1:1000) in BLOTTO for 1 h, and then washed again. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by a chemiluminescent method (CDP Star™, New England Biolabs) using pre-flashed Kodak X-AR film. For other immunoblots, cell extracts were incubated with 5 µg/ml anti-EGFR or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies and visualized as described above, except the secondary antibody was a rabbit anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate. A bright green mutant of GFP, enhanced GFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), was attached to the carboxyl terminus of human EGFR as previously described (29Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This construct behaves like wild-type EGFR in assays of phosphorylation, protein-protein interactions, signal transduction, internalization, and degradation (29Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 6-well plates were incubated with vehicle, EGF, or 5-HT prior to incubation with various concentrations of EGF (1–100 ng/ml) for various times at 37 °C. Monolayers were then washed twice with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were then washed with cold acid wash buffer (50 mm glycine, 100 mm NaCl, pH 3.0) to dissociate bound EGF followed by three cold Hanks' balanced salt solution washings. Cells were then incubated with 50 pm125I-EGF for 90 min at 4 °C in HEPES binding medium (RPMI 1640 with 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) in the continuing presence of vehicle or 5-HT. Cells were then washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and dissolved in 1 ml of 1 m NaOH. The solubilized material was collected in scintillation vials and counted in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in quadruplicate wells containing 100 ng/ml unlabeled EGF and was subtracted from total binding to yield specific 125I-EGF binding at each time point. Data were analyzed using Prism 2.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Oligonucleotides (E2F1, CREB, or NF-κB transcription factor consensus binding sites) were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ32P]CTP. Nuclear extracts were prepared exactly as described (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay was modified from a previously published protocol (31Grewal J.S. Bag J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture comprised 10 µg of nuclear extracts, 1–2 µg of poly(dI-dC), 5 µl of 5× binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm spermidine, 15 mm MgCl2, 36% glycerol, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 15 mmdithiothreitol). This mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min, and then 40,000–70,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide were added. The reaction mixture was incubated further for 15 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were then resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gels and quantified with a PhosphorImager after drying. For the CREB assays, cells were pretreated with Ro20–1724 (4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone), a selective cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor. For competition assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with unlabeled oligonucleotides at room temperature for 15 min before adding 32P to the labeled oligonucleotide. When possible, reactions were also carried out by using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide carrying mutations in the consensus regions to check the specificity of the binding reaction. Assays for the inhibition of endocytosis were carried out as described previously by Jockerset al. (32Jockers R. Angers S. Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells that were serum-starved for 24 h in 6-well culture plates or 100-mm dishes were treated with various conditions that inhibit endocytosis, including potassium depletion (33Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), hypertonic medium (34Daukas G. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35Moss A.L. Ward W.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), concanavalin A (36Henis Y.I. Elson E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1981; 136: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and monodansylcadaverine (37Davies P.J. Davies D.R. Levitzki A. Maxfield F.R. Milhaud P. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Nature. 1980; 283: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 38Phonphok Y. Rosenthal K.S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with cycloheximide (5 µg/ml) for 30 min prior to treatment with mitogens to prevent the confounding effects of protein synthesis. Procedures to inhibit endocytosis were also performed for 30 min prior to experimentation coincident with cycloheximide. The buffers used were as follow: potassium depletion buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 4.5 mg/liter dextrose); hypertonic medium (RPMI 1640, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 4.5 g/liter dextrose, and 500 mm sucrose); and medium for chemical inhibition by concanavalin A (250 µg/ml) or 500 µmmonodansylcadaverine (RPMI 1640, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 4.5 g/liter dextrose). Cells were then shifted to 4 °C, and cell-surface EGFRs were measured by radioligand binding. HEK293 or mesangial cells were grown on round coverslips by placing coverslips at the bottom of the wells in 6- or 12-well culture plates. After rinsing in PBS, adherent cells transfected with the EGFR-GFP fusion protein were identified by incubating with rhodamine-concanavalin A (10 µg/ml in PBS) for 2 min at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed with PBS several times and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min followed by quenching the fixative with three 5-min washes with 50 mm NH4Cl at room temperature. For single labeling of EGFR, cells on coverslips were fixed as described above and were then inverted onto 20 µl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-EGFR antibody raised against an extracellular epitope of the receptor (1:100) dilution in PBS with 1% goat serum and incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were rinsed four times with PBS supplemented with 1% goat serum for 10 min. Coverslips were then mounted on a slide with Slow-Fade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and sealed with Cytoseal (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) solution before scanning under a confocal microscope (Olympus Merlin™ IX70, Melville, NY). Cells in 100 mm-culture dishes were treated with 30 µg/ml cycloheximide or puromycin dihydrochloride for 1 h before treatment with 5-HT for different time periods, after which cells were washed and scraped into a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer as described above. Total EGFR protein was visualized by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described above using anti-EGFR polyclonal antibody for immunoprecipitation and an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody for immunoblotting. Fig. 1 shows that when rat renal mesangial cells were treated with 1 µM 5-HT for 3 min, EGFRs became phosphorylated as detected by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of EGFRs. The increase was dependent upon both the concentration of 5-HT (EC50 = 160 nm) and time of incubation, peaking at 3–10 min. EGFR phosphorylation was blocked almost completely when cells were pretreated with the specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 for 30 min prior to exposure to 5-HT. Thus, the 5-HT2A receptor transactivates the EGFR through the intrinsic kinase activity of the EGFR in a manner already shown to occur with other GPCRs such as those for angiotensin II (6Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Inagami T. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Owada K.M. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 201-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), carbachol, lysophosphatidic acid, and thrombin (12Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 39Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Because both ERK and PKC can induce phosphorylation of the EGFR (40Morrison P. Takishima K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15536-15543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and because the 5-HT2A receptor has been shown to activate both ERK and PKC (27Grewal J.S. Mukhin Y.V. Garnovskaya M.N. Raymond J.R. Greene E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F922-F930PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ganz M.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F576-F585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used inhibitors of ERK kinase (MEK1) and PKC to determine which of those intermediates might be involved in 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR. Fig. 1 c shows that a PKC inhibitor (5 µm GF109203X) greatly attenuated 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR, whereas a MEK inhibitor (100 µm PD98059) did not. This concentration of PD98059 nearly completely attenuates ERK activation by the 5-HT2A receptor in these cells as previously determined by us (27Grewal J.S. Mukhin Y.V. Garnovskaya M.N. Raymond J.R. Greene E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F922-F930PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PKC (and not MEK/ERK) seems to be involved in the transphosphorylation of the EGFR by the 5-HT2A receptor in mesangial cells. Next, we examined the effects of 5-HT on the activation of three EGFR-stimulated transcription factors (E2F, CREB, and NF-κB). Fig. 2 shows that acute treatment with either 5-HT or EGF induced activation of all three transcription factors as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Moreover, the stimulation of all three transcription factors by 5-HT could be attenuated by preincubation with AG1478. Similarly, AG1478 blocked 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of ERK in mesangial cells (not shown). Those results suggest that the 5-HT2A receptor in mesangial cells activates transcription factors through the intermediary actions of the EGFR. To further explore the similarities between the effects of 5-HT and EGF on EGFR function, we next studied the effects of prior treatment with 5-HT on the activation of downstream signals by EGF. Our rationale for those studies is that EGF treatment has been shown to desensitize the EGFR to subsequent activation by EGF. Thus, we hypothesized that 5-HT pretreatment might also desensitize the EGFR. Fig. 3 shows the results of studies in which EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation was assessed after pretreatment with vehicle or 5-HT. Those results clearly demonstrate that pretreatment of mesangial cells with 5-HT results in a marked attenuation of the ability of EGF to induce phosphorylation of ERK. We used a similar paradigm to assess the effects of prior treatment with 5-HT on the ability of EGF to activate the three transcription factors shown in Fig. 2. Those results are shown in Fig.4, a–c. Pretreatment with 5-HT greatly reduced transcription factor activation as reflected by their binding with respective labeled consensuscis-elements. The specificity of the interactions of the transcription factors with their consensus oligonucleotides was confirmed by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides and mutant (nonbinding) oligonucleotides. Figs. 3 and 4 show that multiple signals residing downstream from the EGFR can be attenuated by pretreatment with 5-HT, which suggested to us that desensitization of the EGFR most likely occurs at the level of the receptor itself. Therefore, we tested the effects of pretreatment with 5-HT on the ability of EGF to induce autophosphorylation of the EGFR. Fig. 5shows that pretreatment of mesangial cells with 5-HT leads to a marked decrease in the ability of multiple concentrations of EGF to induce the phosphorylation of its receptor. The attenuation was consistent over a broad range of concentrations of EGF, suggesting that that this effect may be relevant under physiological conditions. If the effect of pretreatment of cells with 5-HT is truly important, we would expect that other GPCRs might also desensitize the EGFR. Indeed, attenuation of EGF-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR was observed when cells were pretreated with other mitogenic GPCR ligands such as bradykinin and lysophosphatidic acid (Fig.6, a and b) as well as angiotensin (not shown). Thus, the ability of GPCR to desensitize EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR is not limited to the 5-HT2A receptor. One of the major pathways that links Gi and Gq-coupled receptors to mitogenic signals in mesangial and other cells involves PKC (3van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.J.

We therefore examined the effects of direct stimulation of PKC on the ability of EGF to induce phosphorylation of the EGFR. Fig.6 c shows that when cells were pretreated with 1 µm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the ability of EGF to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR was reduced by at least 60%. These results suggest that PKC is involved in both transactivation and desensitization of the EGFR by GPCRs. One potential mechanism through which the EGFR could be desensitized is by internalization such that cell-surface EGFRs available for binding by EGF would be diminished. Thus, we measured cell-surface EGFRs by ligand binding and by confocal microscopy. For ligand binding, cells were treated for 1 h with vehicle, EGF, or 5-HT and subjected to acid wash, and then cell-surface125I-EGF binding was measured. Fig.7 shows that preincubation with either 5-HT (300 nm or 3 µm) or EGF (20 ng/ml) resulted in a marked down-regulation of cell-surface125I-EGF binding, which was nearly complete after 10 min of pre-incubation.

A nanometre-sized superconducting grain (commonly referred to as a Cooper-pair box2) connected to a reservoir by a Josephson junction is an important example of such a system. Although the grain contains a large number of electrons, it has been experimentally demonstrated6 that its states are given by a superposition of only two charge states (differing by 2e, where e is the electronic charge). Coupling between charge transfer and mechanical motion in nanometre-sized structures has also received considerable attention7,8,9,10. Here we demonstrate theoretically that a movable Cooper-pair box oscillating periodically between two remote superconducting electrodes can serve as a mediator of Josephson coupling, leading to coherent transfer of Cooper pairs between the electrodes. Both the magnitude and the direction of the resulting Josephson current can be controlled by externally applied electrostatic fields."

Although proteasomal activity generates the precise C termini of antigenic epitopes, the mechanism(s) involved in generation of the precise N termini is largely unknown. To investigate the mechanism of N-terminal peptide processing, we used a cell-free system in which two recombinant ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) constructs, one expressing the native H2-Kb-restricted ovalbumin (ova)-derived epitope SIINFEKL (ODC-ova) and the other expressing the extended epitope LESIINFEKL (ODC-LEova), were targeted to degradation by 26 S proteasomes followed by import into microsomes. We found that the cleavage specificity of the 26 S proteasome was influenced by the N-terminal flanking amino acids leading to significantly different yields of the final epitope SIINFEKL. Following incubation in the presence of purified 26 S proteasome, ODC-LEova generated largely ESIINFEKL that was efficiently converted to the final epitope SIINFEKL following translocation into microsomes. The conversion of ESIINFEKL to SIINFEKL was strictly dependent on the presence of H2-Kband was completely inhibited by the metalloaminopeptidase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. Importantly, the converting activity was resistant to a stringent salt/EDTA wash of the microsomes and was only apparent when transport of TAP, the transporter associated with antigen processing, was facilitated. These results strongly suggest a crucial role for a luminal endoplasmic reticulum-resident metalloaminopeptidase in the N-terminal trimming of major histocompatability complex class I-associated peptides.

The proteasome is an abundant cytosolic multisubunit protease consisting of the proteolytic 20 S core particle that associates with PA700 regulatory complexes to form 26 S proteasomes or with PA28 complexes (29Voges D.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) constitutes an exception because it is targeted to 26 proteasomes by antizyme in a ubiquitin-independent fashion (31Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S.

The in vitro cleavage specificities of purified 20 S proteasomes and the relevance of proteasomal processing for the generation of immunodominant epitopes have been investigated in great detail (1Rock K.L.

Although 20 S proteasomes have been shown to precisely cleave a number of known class I ligands out of model polypeptide substrates, a minor part of cleavage products is longer than the canonical length of class I-binding peptides (38Niedermann G.

On average, the 26 S proteasomal cleavage products were found to be slightly shorter than peptides generated by 20 S proteasomes containing greater proportions of peptides that are too short for efficient TAP-mediated translocation as well as for class I binding (40Kisselev A.F.

Proteasomes seem to be the dominant, if not the only, protease that generates the correct C terminus of class I ligands, whereas the N-terminal trimming of proteasomal products is insensitive to proteasome inhibitors (20Craiu A.

Leucine aminopeptidase, puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, and bleomycin hydrolase have been implicated in the cytoplasmic trimming of proteasomal products (44Beninga J. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. J.

In addition, tripeptidyl peptidase II has been suggested to play a role in the generation of class I ligands or precursors (46Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari-Hartz M. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. Niedermann G. Science. 1999; 283: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Different lines of evidence suggest that precursors of class I ligands can be trimmed in the ER lumen to their final lengths. Processing of peptide imported into microsomes was directly shown by biochemical methods (14Roelse J. Grommé M. Momburg F. Hämmerling G. Neefjes J. J. Exp.

The broad but not random substrate specificity of TAP precludes that 9-mer peptides containing a proline residue at position 2 or 3 are efficiently bound and transported by TAP (48Neefjes J.

Nevertheless, several MHC class I alloforms in man and mouse prefer a proline residue at position 2 or 3 in the associated 9-mer peptide (51Rammensee H.G. Falk K. Rötzschke O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Also for some peptides not containing proline, the addition of flanking residues to minimal epitopes strongly improved TAP affinities (50van Endert P.M. Riganelli D. Greco G. Fleischhauer K.

N-terminal trimming of a precursor peptide was recently suggested to depend on the presence of the correct class I restriction element (47Paz P. Brouwenstijn N. Perry R. Shastri N. Immunity. 1999; 11: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the identity and biochemical properties of the aminopeptidase(s) in charge remains elusive. To investigate the relative contribution of the proteasome and the cytosolic and ER peptidases to the generation of the definite class I epitope, we have developed an in vitro system in which recombinant ODC containing ovalbumin (ova) peptides are targeted to degradation by 26 S proteasomes followed by import into purified microsomes. We find that the yield of a finally processed H2-Kb-binding epitope was strongly influenced by N-terminal flanking amino acids in the protein sequence. We show that a slightly extended ova epitope precursor was efficiently trimmed following TAP-mediated import into microsomes. The conversion into the definite epitope could be blocked by the aminopeptidase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline (PNT) and was strictly dependent on the presence of MHC class I molecules known to associate with the epitope. The peptide SIINFEKL was synthesized by Anaspec (San Jose, CA). The peptide ESIINFEKL was synthesized by Dr. M. Fridkin at the Department of Organic Chemistry, The Weizmann Institute (Rehovot, Israel). The peptides HESIINFEKL, HLESIINFEKL, QSHESIINFEKL, and QSHLESIINFEKL were synthesized at the peptide synthesis core facility of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) (Heidelberg, Germany).

To inhibit proteasome activity, a 2-ml aliquot of the cytosol (20 mg of protein) was incubated with 35 µm lactacystin for 30 min at 37 °C. The lactacystin-treated cytosol was then dialyzed for 16 h at 4 °C against 500 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm DTT and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Inhibition of proteasome activity in the cytosol was greater than 90% as determined by the inhibition of fluorogenic peptide Suc-LLVY-methyl coumarin hydrolyzing activity (61Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomes were prepared according to the protocol described by Shepherd et al. (58Shepherd J.C. Schumacher T.N.M. Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Imaeda S. Ploegh H.L. Janeway Jr., C.A. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 74: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice (8–10 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 0.2 mg of poly(inosine-cytosine)/mouse 24 h prior to sacrifice. The livers and spleens were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized in a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem Teflon tissue grinder. Homogenization was in 3 ml/liver buffer A (50 mm triethanolamine acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 250 mm sucrose, and a 1:25 (w/v) solution of protease inhibitors). The extract was then subjected to fractional centrifugation at 1,000 × g and then at 10,000 × g. The supernatant from the 10,000 ×g spin was then placed on top of a sucrose cushion containing 1.3 m sucrose in buffer A at a ratio of 2:1 (sample:cushion) and then centrifuged at 140,000 ×g for 2.5 h. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in buffer B (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, and 250 mm sucrose) to a concentration of 200 A 280 nm units/ml. The microsome suspension was then stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The microsome suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min in 10 volumes of buffer C (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 0.5 m KCl, and 15 mm EDTA). The membrane suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g in a microcentrifuge. The membrane pellet was then resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer D without EDTA and immediately centrifuged as described above. The final membrane pellet was resuspended in the processing reaction mixture. The protein content of the stripped microsomes was less than 40% of that of untreated membranes as determined by measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm. TAP-mediated peptide transport was determined by measuring the ATP-dependent transport of the radioiodinated peptide TNKTRIDGQY into isolated microsomes as previously described (63Koopmann J.O. Post M. Neefjes J.J. Hämmerling G.J. Momburg F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Purified microsomes (1 unit) were incubated in a reaction mixture containing the following components in a final volume of 100 µl: 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 2.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, and 125I-labeled peptide (40 ng, 106 cpm). In reactions without ATP, 2-deoxyglucose (20 mm) and hexokinase (3 µg) were added instead of ATP and the ATP-regenerating system. Following incubation for 10 min at 37 °C the microsomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was removed, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2 and 1% Nonidet P-40) and then sonicated for 30 s at 50% output power in a water bath sonicator (Ultrasonic Processor, Heat Systems Inc., Farmingdale, NY). The detergent extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. The resulting supernatant was then mixed with 25 µl of concanavalin A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the mixture was then mixed gently for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g in a microcentrifuge and then washed twice with 1-ml portions of lysis buffer. The ATP-dependent transport of peptide was then determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity associated with the beads in the presence of ATP after subtraction of the concanavalin A-associated radioactivity obtained in a parallel reaction carried out in the absence of ATP. Antigen processing reaction mixtures contained the following components in a final volume of 75 µl: 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1.8 units of creatine phosphokinase, 10 µg of recombinant ODC, 15 µg of maltose-binding protein-antizyme fusion protein, and 10 units of 26 S proteasome (for the definition of proteasome units see Ref. 59Ben-Shahar S.

Where indicated purified microsomes (1 A 280 unit) and lactacystin-treated cytosol (60 µg of protein) were also supplemented. Following incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was extracted in 400 µl of ice-cold lysis solution (0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40). The mixture was then sonicated for 60 s at 50% output power in an ice-cooled bath sonicator. In processing reactions containing microsomes the membranes were first pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 ×g in a microcentrifuge and then extracted in lysis buffer as described above. The acid extract was then filtered through a 10-kDa cut-off filter (Microcon 10 concentrator, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the filtrate was collected and lyophilized. The lyophilized material was chromatographed by reverse phase HPLC, and the fractions corresponding to the elution position of synthetic SIINFEKL were pooled and lyophilized exactly as previously described (59Ben-Shahar S.

Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 100 µl containing the following components: 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 2.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, microsomes (1 unit), and 50 fmol of synthetic ESIINFEKL or HLESIINFEKL. Where indicated, 1,10-phenanthroline (2 mm) or bestatin (250 µm) were added. In reactions without ATP, hexokinase (3 µg) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2-deoxyglucose (20 mm) were added instead of ATP and the ATP-regenerating system. The reaction was preincubated for 4 min at 37 °C, and then ESIINFEKL was added for a further incubation for 8 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 450 µl of lysis buffer and then processed as described above. We detected low SIINFEKL activity even in the absence of microsomes. This activity was probably because of residual SIINFEKL present in the synthetic ESIINFEKL preparation that we estimated to be ∼5%"

Tropoelastin is soluble at 20 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, but at 37 °C equilibrium is established between soluble protein and insoluble coacervate. Sedimentation equilibrium studies performed before (20 °C) and after (37 °C) coacervation showed that the soluble component was strictly monomeric. Sedimentation velocity experiments revealed that at both temperatures soluble tropoelastin exists as two independently sedimenting monomeric species present in approximately equal concentrations. Species 1 had a frictional ratio at both temperatures of ∼2.2, suggesting a very highly expanded or asymmetric protein. Species 2 displayed a frictional ratio at 20 °C of 1.4 that increased to 1.7 at 37 °C, indicating a compact and symmetrical conformation that expanded or became asymmetric at the higher temperature. The slow interconversion of the two monomeric species contrasts with the rapid and reversible process of coacervation suggesting both efficiently incorporate into the coacervate. A hydrated protein of equivalent molecular weight modeled as a sphere and a flexible chain was predicted to have a frictional ratio of 1.2 and 1.6, respectively. Tropoelastin appeared as a single species when studied by pulsed field-gradient spin-echo NMR, but computer modeling showed that the method was insensitive to the presence of two species of equal concentration having similar diffusion coefficients. Scintillation proximity assays using radiolabeled tropoelastin and sedimentation analysis showed that the coacervation at 37 °C was a highly cooperative monomer-n-mer self-association. A critical concentration of 3.4 g/liter was obtained when the coacervate was modeled as a helical polymer formed from the monomers via oligomeric intermediates.

The precursor of elastin, tropoelastin, is devoid of cross-links. Following secretion from the cell surface, tropoelastin undergoes coacervation, which is a process of self-association characterized by an inverse temperature transition (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Tropoelastin is soluble in aqueous solution at room temperature in vitro, but upon raising the temperature to 37 °C the solution becomes turbid as tropoelastin molecules associate to form large aggregates (2Urry D.W. Starcher B. Partridge S.M. Nature. 1969; 222: 795-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,3Cox B.A. Starcher B.C. Urry D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 997-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process of coacervation results from multiple intermolecular interactions of the hydrophobic domains (3Cox B.A. Starcher B.C. Urry D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 997-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bressan G.M. Pasquali-Ronchetti I. Fornieri C. Mattioli F. Castellani I. Volpin D. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1986; 94: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The tropoelastin coacervate is a thick viscoelastic phase that is not miscible with the overlying solution (5Urry D.W. J. Protein Chem. 1988; 7: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). On cooling to 20 °C, the aggregates dissociate reversibly, and the solution turns clear. Alternating between hydrophobic domains in the protein are short sequences of amino acid residues that form the cross-linking domains (6Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Coacervation may concentrate and align tropoelastin molecules prior to elastin formation via lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linkage of the lysine residues that leads to a growing elastic fiber (4Bressan G.M.

Vrhovski et al. (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) demonstrated that maximal coacervation of recombinant human tropoelastin occurs under the physiologically relevant conditions of 37 °C, 150 mm NaCl, and pH 7–8. Through coacervation, tropoelastin molecules were thought to be converted from molecules largely lacking secondary and tertiary structure to a more ordered state (2Urry D.W. Starcher B. Partridge S.M. Nature. 1969; 222: 795-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Starcher B.C. Saccomani G. Urry D.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Electron micrographs show parallel arrays of 5-nm-wide filaments of tropoelastin coacervates that are similar to the fibrous structure of mature elastin (3Cox B.A. Starcher B.C. Urry D.W. J. Biol.

The importance of coacervation in the formation of lysine cross-links has been shown in smooth muscle cells where culturing at temperatures below 37 °C hampers elastin formation (12Narayanan A.S. Page R.C. Kuzan F. Cooper C.G. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Prosser I.W. Mecham R.P. Varner J.E. Self-assembling Architecture. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 1-23Google Scholar). In the work described here, analytical ultracentrifugation, pulsed field-gradient spin-echo (PGSE)1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and scintillation proximity assays were employed, in conjunction with computer modeling studies, to characterize the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of recombinant tropoelastin before (20 °C) and after (37 °C) coacervation. We show that at both temperatures soluble tropoelastin exists as at least two monomeric forms that have the capacity to coacervate in a manner similar to a classical critical concentration model of polymerization. Tropoelastin SHELΔ26A (M r = 60,140) was expressed and extracted from a culture of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as described previously (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21719-21724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). SHELΔ26A is a recombinant human tropoelastin lacking the hydrophilic domain encoded by exon 26A and is identical to a naturally occurring isoform of human tropoelastin found in connective tissue. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed to check the purity of protein samples (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 222: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Concentrations of acrylamide for the resolving gel and the stacking gel were 10 and 4%, respectively. For coacervation, full-length tropoelastin was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl, which mimics the ionic conditions found to be optimal for coacervation (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium of tropoelastin was performed in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at different initial loading concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 4.0 g/liter. The protein solution was dialyzed extensively against PBS at 4 °C and spun in a benchtop centrifuge at room temperature at ∼12,000 × g for 30 min prior to the ultracentrifuge experiments. 120-µl aliquots of tropoelastin were loaded into the sample channels of Yphantis 6-channel, 12-mm centerpieces, and 125 µl of diffusate into the corresponding reference channels. Centrifugation was conducted in an AnTi-60 rotor at 15,000 rpm to sedimentation equilibrium at 20 and 37 °C. Radial absorbance scans were collected in continuous scan mode at 280 and 250 nm every 4 h with 10 replicates and a step size of 0.001 cm. A base-line scan at 360 nm was taken to correct for optical imperfections. Sedimentation equilibrium was considered to have been achieved when there was an overlap between two consecutive scans. The Ω function was used to test for sample homogeneity and attainment of chemical equilibrium (16Milthorpe B.K. Jeffrey P.D. Nichol L.W. Biophys. Chem. 1975; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Ralston G.B. Morris M.B. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science.

Chem. 1975; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as indicated in Equation 1,Ω=c(r)exp[φ1M1(rF2−r2)]/c(rF)(Eq. 1) =a1(rF)c(r)/a1(r)c(rF)where c(r) is the total protein concentration at radial distance r;c(r F) is the total protein concentration at reference radial distance r F;a 1(r) is the thermodynamic activity of the protomer at radial distance r;a 1(r F) is the thermodynamic activity of the protomer at reference radial distancer F; and M 1 is the molar weight of the protomer. φ1 = (1 − v̄ ρ)ω2/2RT, wherev̄ is the partial specific volume (ml/g) of tropoelastin at the absolute temperature T; ρ is the density of the solvent (g/ml) at the experimental temperature; ω is the angular velocity of the rotor; and R is the universal gas constant. Protein concentrations were determined using the calculated extinction coefficient value of 0.322 liters/g/cm at 280 nm (GCG version 8.0-UNIX Peptidesort) and 0.154 liters/g/cm at 250 nm. The v̄ of SHELΔ26A was calculated from the amino acid composition to be 0.7574, 0.7595, and 0.7646 ml/g at 20, 25, and 37 °C, respectively (Sednterp version 1.01; retrieved from the RASMB server; 18Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The ρ of PBS was calculated to be 1.0057 and 1.0008 g/ml at 20 and 37 °C, respectively (Sednterp version 1.01). The WinNonlin version 1.035 software package (19Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) was used to fit plots of c(r) versus r 2/2 obtained from three different loading concentrations of tropoelastin centrifuged to chemical equilibrium. The program returned values of the molar weight and the second virial coefficient, B, together with values representing the 95% confidence intervals of the parameter values. B is a measure of the nonideality of the solute, which principally arises from the size and shape of the solute and its effective charge in the buffer conditions employed (19Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Values of apparent weight average molar weight,M wapp, were obtained by a sliding 19-point linear regression of plots of lnc(r) versus r 2. Regression of the plots and smoothing were performed with the Ommenu series of programs. 2The Ommenu package of programs for analyzing data using the Ω function or weight average molecular weights is available at biochem.uthscsa.edu/auc/. Click on the RASMB Mirror button under analysis software and download under the heading Software by Greg Ralston. M wapp is defined in Equation 2 (20Teller D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 346-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar),Mwapp=[dlnc(r)/dr2]/φ1(Eq. 2) =Mw/[1+BMwc(r)]where M w is the ideal weight average molar weight. Sedimentation velocity was performed in the Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at initial loading concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 5.0 g/liter. 400-µl aliquots of tropoelastin were loaded into the sample channels of double-sector, 12-mm centerpieces and 450 µl of buffer into the corresponding reference channels. Centrifugation was conducted in an AnTi-60 rotor at 48,000 rpm for 5 h at either 20 or 37 °C. Radial absorbance scans were collected in continuous scan mode at either 280 or 250 nm every 4 min with two replicates and a step size of 0.005 cm. Data analysis was performed by directly fitting plots of dc(r)/dt versus s* using the DCDT+ package. s* is the apparent sedimentation coefficient defined in Equation 3 (21Stafford III., W.F. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 119-137Crossref Google Scholar),s*=ln(r/rm)/ω2t(Eq. 3) where r m is the radial distance of the solution meniscus, and t is the equivalent time of sedimentation. The data were best fit by a model describing two independently sedimenting species, and the program returned values of the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients (s andD, respectively) for each species along with their standard errors (22Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Values of s and D were corrected to the equivalent values in water at 20 °C (s 20,w andD 20,w, respectively) using values for the viscosity, η, of PBS of 1.0192 and 0.70346 centipoise at 20 and 37 °C, respectively (Sednterp version 1.01), and density values as given above. Plots of s 20,w andD 20,w versus initial loading concentration were extrapolated to zero concentration by linear regression to give the s20,w0 and D20,w0 values. The molar weight, M, of each species was then calculated from the relationship (23van Holde K.S. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 79-121Google Scholar) shown in Equation 4,M=s20,w0RT/D20,w0(1−v¯ρ20,w)(Eq. 4) where ρ20,w is the density of water at 20 °C. Sedimentation data were used to calculate the frictional ratio f20,w0/f 0of tropoelastin. f20,w0 is defined in Equation 5 (23van Holde K.S. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 79-121Google Scholar),f20,w0=M(1−v¯ρ20,w)/Ns20,w0(Eq. 5) where N is Avogadro's number.f 0 is the frictional coefficient of a hard, unhydrated spherical particle and is defined in Equation 6 and as follows (23van Holde K.S. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 79-121Google Scholar),fo=6πηRe(Eq. 6) Re=(3Mv¯/4πN)1/3(Eq. 7) where η is the viscosity of water at 20 °C andR e is the radius of the sphere of the particle with molar weight of SHELΔ26A at 20 °C. By using values of f20,w0 calculated from Equation 5, R e for sedimenting species of tropoelastin was calculated using an equation analogous to Equation 6. The value of f20,w0/f 0was used to obtain an axial ratio, a/d, for a prolate spheroid of revolution (where a represents the major axis and d represents the minor axis) (23van Holde K.S. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 79-121Google Scholar). Tropoelastin was dissolved in both PBS and pure water, and the solutions were brought to concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 g/liter. Samples were loaded in 5-mm outer diameter NMR tubes (Shigemi) to a height of 1 cm. PGSE experiments were conducted on a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) with an Oxford Instruments 9.4 T vertical wide bore magnet (Oxford, UK), using a Bruker 10 T/m z axis gradient probe. PGSE experiments conducted at 20 °C used a pulse sequence as described previously (24Torres A.M. Taurins A.T. Regan D.G. Chapman B.E. Kuchel P.W. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 138: 135-143Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Experiments conducted at 37 °C used a double spin-echo pulse sequence to compensate for convection in the sample (25Sørland G.H. Seland J.G. Krane J. Anthonsen H.W. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 142: 132-135Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pulse sequence parameters for all experiments are as follows: duration of field-gradient pulses, δ = 2 ms; time interval between field-gradient pulses, Δ = 20 ms; 90° R F pulse, 18–20 µs; total spin-echo time, TE = 40 ms; between 128 transients per spectrum for the highest concentration sample (10 g/liter) and 4096 transients per spectrum for the lowest concentration sample (0.5 g/liter) were acquired; maximum field-gradient, g max = 3.75 T/m. The water signal was suppressed during the relaxation delay to allow the use of higher receiver gain. Routinely, 16 spectra were acquired with a sequential increase in the value of g. The gradients were calibrated using the known diffusion coefficient of water in an isotropic and unbounded region (26Mills R. J. Phys. Chem. 1973; 77: 685-688Crossref Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). A single experiment was conducted for each concentration of sample at 20 °C. At 37 °C duplicate experiments were conducted on a 10 g/liter sample of tropoelastin in water only. Tropoelastin forms a coacervate in PBS at 37 °C yielding a sedimenting phase in the sample tube (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), thus precluding this type of sample for diffusion measurements at 37 °C. In each spectrum the signal intensity was measured as the integral of the tropoelastin resonance envelope in the aliphatic region (∼5.5–2.5 ppm) after manual phase and base-line correction. Signal intensities were normalized with respect to the signal intensity in the first spectrum, corresponding to the smallest field gradient. The natural logarithm of the signal intensity was plotted as a function of the Stejskal-Tanner parameter, b, which is proportional to the square of the applied field gradient (27Stejskal E.O. Tanner J.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1965; 42: 288-292Crossref Scopus (6910) Google Scholar). The Origin software package (Microcal) was used to fit a straight line to the plotted data, and the slope of this line provided an estimate of the diffusion coefficient. Diffusion coefficients for tropoelastin in water and in PBS at 20 °C were then plotted as a function of concentration, and linear regression was used again to extrapolate the line to zero concentration thus yielding values for D 0.D 0 for tropoelastin in PBS was then corrected for the viscosity of water to yield D20,w0. A weight average D 37,w was calculated from the duplicate diffusion coefficients estimated for tropoelastin in water at 37 °C; the weighting factor was the inverse of the variance of each value. Computer modeling was used to address two questions arising from the ultracentrifuge data. First, is the resolution of the PGSE NMR diffusion data adequate to suggest the existence of more than one species? Second, does a system in which one species is modeled as a compact sphere and the other species as a flexible chain or rigid rod molecule account for the observed hydrodynamic properties? To answer the first question, a computer model (model I) was written in Maple (Waterloo Software Inc., Canada). Signal intensities for a PGSE NMR diffusion experiment were calculated for a series of gradient values using the same parameters as those used in the actual experiment. The model assumed two independent non-interacting species of equal concentration having D20,w0 of 4.0 and 6.0 × 10−11 m2/s (comparable to those determined by sedimentation velocity experiments at 20 °C, see “Results”). The following formula, shown in Equation 8, was used for the calculation,E=C1e−D1b+C2e−D2b(Eq. 8) where E is signal intensity;C 1 and C 2 are the concentrations of the two species; D 1 andD 2 are the diffusion coefficients of the two species; and b is the Stejskal-Tanner parameter (27Stejskal E.O. Tanner J.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1965; 42: 288-292Crossref Scopus (6910) Google Scholar). The signal-to-noise ratio and its standard deviation were calculated from the actual PGSE NMR experiment. Random noise, whose amplitude had a standard deviation equal to that of the experimental data, was then superimposed on the calculated signal intensities. The natural logarithm of the calculated signal intensity with its associated noise was then plotted as a function of the Stejskal-Tanner parameterb. Linear regression was used to fit a straight line to the simulated PGSE NMR data in order to determine whether there was any statistically discernible deviation from linearity. To answer the second question, a model (Model II) was written in Matlab (MathWorks) and was used to predict D20,w0 for a tropoelastin monomer, when it was modeled as follows: 1) a hard unhydrated sphere; 2) a hard hydrated sphere; 3) a hydrated flexible chain; and 4) a rigid rod. Note that the aim of the simulation was not to calculate accurate values of D20,w0 for possible conformations of the protein but rather to determine whether the difference in the experimental values could be explained in terms of these conformations. For this reason, the model assumed an ideal solution in which the diffusing molecules do not interact or give rise to excluded volume effects. The amino acid residues, which constitute the monomers in the flexible chain and rigid rod models, were assumed to be identical hard spherical units and to have the same partial specific volume (0.7574 ml/g) as was determined for the protein from its amino acid sequence (see “Materials and Methods”). The Stokes equation and the Einstein equation (also referred to as the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation (see Ref. 28Tyrrell H.J.V. Harris K.R. Diffusion in Liquids: A Theoretical and Experimental Study. Butterworths, London1984Google Scholar)) were used to calculate values of f20,w0 and D20,w0, respectively, of the amino acid residues in the flexible chain and rigid rod models, and of the unhydrated and hydrated spheres. The hydrodynamic parameters for the flexible chain were calculated using Equations 36 and 37 of Kirkwood and Riseman (29Kirkwood J.G. Riseman J. Auer P.L. Macromolecules. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc., New York1967: 67-80Google Scholar) and for the rigid rod using Equations 22 and 23 of Riseman and Kirkwood (30Riseman J. Kirkwood J.G. Auer P.L. Macromolecules. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc., New York1967: 96-106Google Scholar). A weighted average specific volume for the hydrated molecules was calculated to account for the associated water molecules. For a typical protein, each gram of its dry weight contains between 0.3 and 0.6 g of associated water, whose properties are significantly different to those of the bulk water (31Cooke R. Kuntz I.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1974; 3: 95-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This corresponds to limits of ∼1.4 and ∼2.8 water molecules per amino acid residue for tropoelastin monomers, and thus hydrodynamic parameters were calculated for all models on the basis of these two values. The values of f20,w0/f 0for the hydrated sphere, flexible chain, and rigid rod were calculated as the ratio of the molecule's f20,w0 to that of the hard unhydrated sphere. 125I-Labeled tropoelastin was prepared by incubating 1 mg of tropoelastin (in 0.5 ml of PBS) with 5 µl of 125I (supplied as sodium iodide byAmersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min at room temperature in a microcentrifuge tube coated with 20 ng of IODO-GEN.125I-Tropoelastin was separated from the unincorporated125I by passing the solution through a 9-ml column of Sephadex G-25 beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The scintillation proximity assays were carried out in FlashPlates (Canberra Packard Co.). 125I-Labeled tropoelastin was dissolved in PBS at 10 g/liter, and 100 µl of serially diluted solution was placed into duplicate wells. The plate was loaded into a Packard TopCount microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (Canberra Packard Co.) and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at 20 and 35 °C prior to counting. 35 °C is the highest functional temperature. Association of 125I-labeled tropoelastin by coacervation brought the radioactive signals in close proximity to excite the scintillant, whereas signals from the uncoacervated material remaining in solution very poorly excite scintillant. γ-Counts were determined for 1 min per well in the low energy range and normal efficiency mode. Cross-talk reduction was applied to reduce signals from neighboring wells. For each set of assays, the duplicate data were averaged. The data at 20 °C were subtracted from those at 35 °C to correct for passive coating of the wells by the protein. The corrected counts at 10 g/liter were normalized to 100%. A plot of the normalized counts versusthe total concentration of tropoelastin was then produced from three independent sets of data. Fig.1shows representative results from sedimentation equilibrium experiments performed at 15,000 rpm on tropoelastin in PBS before (20 °C) and after (37 °C) coacervation. Any insoluble coacervate was rapidly sedimented to the base of the solution column and was not detected. At both temperatures, the plots of apparent weight average molar weight,M wapp, versusconcentration, c(r), from three different loading concentrations of protein indicated that the soluble protein was monomeric (e.g. Fig. 1 A). Plots of the Ω function versus c(r) (e.g.Fig. 1 B) from the different loading concentrations overlapped closely, indicating that both chemical and sedimentation equilibrium had been attained. Thus, the samples were homogeneous, and there were no significant concentrations of incompetent species such as irreversibly formed aggregates or truncated species (16Milthorpe B.K. Jeffrey P.D. Nichol L.W. Biophys. Chem. 1975; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Ralston G.B. Morris M.B. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

Plots of c(r) versus r 2/2 were fit with a model describing a single nonideal species using nonlinear least squares techniques (e.g. Fig. 2A). Values were returned for both the molar weight,M w, of the species and its nonideality as measured by the second virial coefficient, B (TableI). This model adequately fitted the data obtained at both 20 and 37 °C as judged by the random distribution of residuals (e.g. Fig. 2 B). Returned estimates of the molar weight were consistent with that of the monomer of tropoelastin. The value of B increased with temperature (Table I) indicating molecular expansion and/or asymmetry. A monomer-dimer model equation fit to the data did not significantly improve the fit as judged by a lack of improvement in the sums of squares of the residuals.Table ISummary of thermodynamic parameters of tropoelastin in PBS, pH 7.4, as determined from sedimentation equilibrium experiments at 20 and 37 °CParameterEstimated value20 °C1-aValues of the parameters obtained by nonlinear regression of plots of c(r)versus r 2/2 (e.g. Fig. 2).

There is accumulating evidence that BHRF1 protects a variety of cell types from apoptosis induced by various external stimuli. To identify specific proteins from normal epithelial cells that interact with BHRF1 and that might promote or inhibit its anti-apoptotic activity, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library derived from human normal foreskin keratinocytes and identified a cellular gene encoding human prenylated rab acceptor 1 (hPRA1). The interaction of hPRA1 with BHRF1 was confirmed using glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation. Two regions of PRA1, amino acids 30–53 and the carboxyl-terminal 21 residues, are important for BHRF1 interactions and two regions of BHRF1, amino acids 1–18 and 89–142, including the Bcl-2 homology domains BH4 and BH1, respectively, are crucial for PRA1 interactions. PRA1 expression interferes with the anti-apoptotic activity of BHRF1, although not of Bcl-2.

Inappropriate regulation of apoptosis contributes to a wide variety of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune, and vascular diseases, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and neurodegenerative disorders (3Cohen G.M.

Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6186) Google Scholar). Among numerous proteins and genes involved in regulating the evolutionarily conserved apoptotic pathway, the best characterized are the Bcl-2 family of proteins (6Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4802) Google Scholar, 7Vaux D.L. Haecker G. Strasser A. Cell. 1994; 76: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), which includes regulatory molecules with both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects. Proteins of the Bcl-2 family possess four-conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains, BH1 to BH4, as well as a transmembrane domain (8Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and these domains have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions (8Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp.

Although the detailed mechanisms of action of the Bcl-2 family proteins remain to be elucidated, it seems that the balance of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, and pro-cell death proteins, such as Bax, is important in determining the susceptibility of cells to various apoptotic stimuli (12Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In addition, several members of the Bcl-2 protein family can interact physically with one another in a complicated network of homo- and heterodimers (11Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 13Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 14Sato T.

Recently, a number of Bcl-2-binding proteins, which do not belong to this family, have been identified, including Raf-1, calcineurin, Bag-1, R-Ras, H-Ras, p53-BP2, SMN, Bis, BI-1, Beclin, and BAR (8Antonsson B.

Evidence is accumulating that proteins of the Bcl-2 family fulfill their pro- or anti-apoptotic roles largely through exerting their effects on mitochondria (13Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 22Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria play a pivotal role in the apoptotic signaling pathway by releasing apoptogenic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytoplasm, such as cytochrome c (23Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4273) Google Scholar) which binds to Apaf-1 and activates caspase-9, thereby eliciting the downstream caspase cascade and inducing apoptosis (13Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 22Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Li P.

It has been shown that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins prevent cytochrome c release and in turn prohibit the activation of the caspase cascade and apoptosis (25Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). In the face of the tremendous diversity of viruses, higher vertebrates have evolved general defense mechanisms to control viral infection. The initiation of apoptosis by host cells is one such innate host response that can quickly and efficiently remove virus-infected cells, so limiting virus reproduction and total viral burden, reducing or eliminating the dissemination of progeny virus in the host, and minimizing the effects of virus infection and the susceptibility to mutational adaptation by virus (26Everett H. McFadden G. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 160-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction of specific host cellular proteins with viral proteins that promote proliferation or protect cells from apoptosis is a key determinant in influencing the dynamic equilibrium between life and death and the extent of virus infection. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded anti-apoptotic protein BHRF1 is of particular interest in this regard. EBV is a ubiquitous human γ-herpesvirus that infects B lymphocytes, where it establishes latent infections, and stratified squamous epithelium, where it undergoes productive replication (27Rickinson A.B. Kieff E. Field B.N. Kinpes D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2397-2446Google Scholar) and increases the susceptibility of these cells to oncogenic transformation. EBV is closely associated with a variety of human diseases, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, gastric carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, infectious mononucleosis, and lymphoproliferative diseases in immunocompromised hosts, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and transplant recipients (28Oda K.

BHRF1 is expressed during the EBV lytic cycle and is a component of the restricted early antigen complex (32Pearson G.R. Luka J. Petti L. Sample J. Birkenbach M. Braun D. Kieff E. Virology. 1987; 160: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The BHRF1 gene is present in the genomes of all natural EBV isolates examined to date and is highly conserved. It shares limited sequence homology to Bcl-2 (33Heller M. Dambaugh T. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1981; 38: 632-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Khanim F. Dawson C. Meseda C.A. Dawson J. Mackett M.

Virol. 2000; 61: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); alignment of BHRF1 and Bcl-2 reveals ∼25% amino acid sequence identity and 42% amino acid sequence similarity (36Marchini A. Tomkinson B. Cohen J.I. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5991-6000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like Bcl-2, BHRF1 is primarily located in the mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membranes (34Khanim F. Dawson C. Meseda C.A. Dawson J. Mackett M. Young L.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2987-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Hickish T. Robertson D. Clarke P. Hill M. di Stefano F. Clarke C. Cunningham D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2808-2811PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies indicated that BHRF1 is dispensable for EBV-induced transformation of B lymphocytes and for virus replication in vitro (36Marchini A. Tomkinson B. Cohen J.I. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5991-6000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lee M.A. Yates J.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, previous studies have also demonstrated that BHRF1 protects various cell types from apoptosis induced by a wide range of external stimuli, including growth factor deprivation, serum starvation, ionomycin treatment, heterologous viral infection, and DNA-damaging agents, such as cisplatin, etoposide, and mitomycin C (39Foghsgaard L.

In addition, BHRF1 also protects cells against the apoptotic effects of tumor necrosis factor-α, anti-Fas antibody, activated monocytes, and radiation (34Khanim F. Dawson C. Meseda C.A. Dawson J.

Thus, BHRF1 is both a structural and functional viral homologue of the cellular Bcl-2 protein. This suggests that BHRF1 can inhibit apoptosis during EBV replication, prolonging the life span of EBV-infected cells, and potentiating virus maturation and spread. In the present study, we explored the cellular factors that modulate the anti-apoptotic activity of BHRF1 through protein-protein interactions. The human prenylated rab acceptor 1 (hPRA1) was identified (47Bucci C. Chiariello M. Lattero D. Maiorano M. Bruni C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and its effect on the anti-apoptotic activity of BHRF1 revealed. A series of expression plasmids were established in vector pBTM116 (48Bartel P.L. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1993: 153-179Google Scholar), from which inserted genes were expressed in-frame with a LexA DNA-binding domain (LexA-DB). To construct pBTM/NBHRF1, the entire coding sequence of BHRF1, derived from nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue, was subcloned from plasmid pYYS-2 (49Liu M.Y. Shih Y.Y. Chou S.P. Chen C.J. Sheen T.S.

Truncations of NBHRF1, encoding amino acids (aa) 1–88, 1–142, 1–163, 19–191, and 61–191, were generated from pBTM/NBHRF1 by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the relevant regions. To construct pBTM/BBHRF1, in which BHRF1was derived from EBV associated with infectious mononucleosis, an EBV DNA fragment from genome coordinates 54,376 to 54,948 was amplified from cell line B95.8 by polymerase chain reaction. Plasmid pBTM/Bcl-2 contained a full-length human gene, bcl-2, which was subcloned from a Bcl-2-expression plasmid, pCΔj-SV2-bcl-2-neo (a gift from Y. Tsujimoto, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan) (50Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1958-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBTM/lamin, containing a lamin gene, was used as a control. A tetracycline inducible, “tet-on,” system (51Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar) was used to express NBHFR1. NBHRF1 was cloned into vector pUHD10.3 and its expression could be turned on by a holo-transactivator, composed of a transactivator and a co-transactivator. The transactivator was expressed from plasmid pUHD172–1neo and the co-transactivator was provided in the form of doxycycline (Dox), a tetracycline derivative. Vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) was used to express target proteins constitutively. An EBNA-1 tag (aa 408–446 from EBV nuclear antigen-1) from pCF7 (52Chen M.R. Huang H. Fen C.Y. Chen J.Y. J. Virol. Meth. 2000; 85: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was inserted into the vector for convenient identification of the target protein, resulting in the generation of plasmid pcDNA3.1/NA-1. For constitutive expression of BHRF1, wild type (WT) NBHRF1 and a mutant encoding aa 19–191 were inserted into pcDNA3.1/NA-1 in-frame with the EBNA-1 tag. Plasmids expressing rat PRA1 (rPRA1) and polypeptides derived from it were generously provided by J. K. Ngsee (University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada) (53Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The protein products included WT rPRA1 and polypeptides comprising aa 1–110, 1–164, 30–185, and 54–185, in each case as a fusion protein with a GAL4 activation domain (GAL4-AD) in pGAD424 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) (53Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding the WT protein and aa 1–164, 30–185, and 54–185 of rPRA1 were subcloned into vector pcDNA3-HA to generate an amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tag when expressed in mammalian cells. Human PRA1 (hPRA1) plasmid, pGAD-hPRA1, was a gift from C. B. Bruni (University of Napoli, Napoli, Italy) (47Bucci C. Chiariello M. Lattero D. Maiorano M. Bruni C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and had the entire gene fused to GAL4-AD in vector pGAD10 (CLONTECH). To obtain transient expression of hPRA1 in a mammalian cell system, DNA fragments encoding the WT hPRA1 and polypeptides comprising aa 1–164, 30–185, and 54–185 were subcloned into the pcDNA3-HA. Plasmid pGEX-5X-1/NBHRF1 was designed to express a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-BHRF1 fusion protein following subcloning of the NBHRF1 from pYYS-2 into vector pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out as described by Vojtek et al. (54Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bait plasmid, pBTM/NBHRF1, and a cDNA library of human normal foreskin keratinocytes (CLONTECH), in which the cDNA was fused to the GAL4-AD, were used sequentially to transformSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40. The resulting transformants were then plated on synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking tryptophan (Trp), uracial (Ura), leucine (Leu), lysine (Lys), and histidine (His) (SC-Trp, Ura, Leu, Lys, His) and SC-Trp, Ura, Leu, Lys as a control. His+ colonies were screened for β-galactosidase activity 3 days later by colony-lift filter assay as described (54Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). His+/LacZ+ colonies were candidate clones of cDNAs encoding BHRF1-interacting proteins. After subsequent purification and curing processes, the cDNAs were isolated and sequenced using an ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Core Kit on the ABI 373A DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Foster, CA). The resultant DNA sequences were then subjected to a BLAST search in the GenBankTM data base. The human embryonic kidney cell line, 293 (55Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3497) Google Scholar), and RHEK-1 epithelial cells (56Rhim J.S. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 1345-1365PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. RHEK-1 cells were established by immortalizing primary normal human foreskin keratinocytes with an adenovirus type 12-simian virus 40 hybrid. Transfections were carried out using a modified calcium phosphate method (57Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid DNA, which was dissolved in 125 mm CaCl2, 25 mm BES (pH 6.95), 140 mm NaCl, and 0.75 mmNa2HPO4, was added dropwise to 60% confluent cells and then incubated at 35 °C under 3% CO2 for 18 h. After the medium was refreshed, cells were moved to a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO2. For transient expression, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. To establish stable BHRF1-inducible clones, RHEK-1 cells were co-transfected with pUHD/NBHRF1 and pUHD172–1neo and the transfectants were selected in the presence of 800 µg/ml neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). A stable BHRF1-inducible clone, N27-2, and a pUHD10.3 vector-transfected control clone, V10-3, were maintained in medium containing 400 µg/ml neomycin. Bacterially expressed BHRF1 (49Liu M.Y. Shih Y.Y. Chou S.P. Chen C.J. Sheen T.S. Yang C.S. Chen J.Y. J. Med. Virol. 1998; 56: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was used to immunize BALB/c mice and produce monoclonal antibody (mAb). After several booster immunizations, mice with strong and specific immune responses were sacrificed and hybridoma cells were generated as described by Tsai et al. (58Tsai C.H. Liu M.T. Chen M.R. Lu J. Yang H.L. Chen J.Y. Yang C.S. J. Biomed. Sci. 1997; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The antibody clone with the highest reactivity to BHRF1, 3E8, was selected by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assays. 2S.-P. Chou, L.-Y. Li, C.-H. Tsai, M.-Y. Liu, and J.-Y. Chen, manuscript in preparation. BHRF1 was injected subcutaneously into the backs of rabbits to obtain a specific, polyclonal antiserum. After boosting several times, specific antisera were determined by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assays. N27-2 cells were grown on glass slides and transfected separately with HA-tagged hPRA1 or rPRA1. The cells were then induced with 1 µg/ml Dox for 24 h and fixed with acetone at room temperature for 10 min and the expression of HA-tagged PRA1 and BHRF1 was detected by double staining. The smear was reacted with mouse anti-HA mAb (BAbCO, Richmond, CA) and rabbit anti-BHRF1 polyclonal antiserum as primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Secondary antibodies were then applied to detect the primary antibodies by using Rhodamine RedTM-X-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Jackson, West Grove, PA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Jackson). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were mounted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 90% glycerol and examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Axiovert 135M photomicroscope; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To extract proteins from mammalian cells, the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm octyl glucoside, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.3m NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts from yeast were prepared as described by Sato et al. (14Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were then denatured at 100 °C for 5 min and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electrotransferred to HybondTM-C super nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the blots were reacted with specific antibodies as described previously (35Liu M.Y. Shih Y.Y. Li L.Y. Chou S.P. Sheen T.S. Chen C.L. Yang C.S. Chen J.Y. J. Med. Virol. 2000; 61: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used in this study included anti-LexA-DB rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-GAL4-AD mouse mAb (CLONTECH), anti-GST mouse mAb (kindly provided by C.-H. Tsai, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan), anti-HA mouse mAb (BAbCO), anti-BHRF1 mouse mAb 3E8, anti-EBNA-1 mouse mAb 5C11 (kindly provided by M.-R. Chen, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan) (52Chen M.R. Huang H. Fen C.Y. Chen J.Y. J. Virol. Meth. 2000; 85: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), anti-Bcl-2 mouse mAb (clone 124; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and mouse anti-β-actin mAb (clone AC-15; Sigma). For co-immunoprecipitation assay, cells transfected with appropriate expression plasmids were lysed in lysis buffer, extracts were then incubated with anti-HA mAb or anti-BHRF1 mAb 3E8 at 4 °C overnight. The resulting immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 2 h, washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline, and analyzed by Western blotting. Recombinant GST and GST-BHRF1 fusion proteins were purified and incubated with glutathione-agarose slurry in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mmNaCl) for 4 h at 4 °C. After three washes in binding buffer, the bound GST and GST-BHRF1 were incubated with in vitrotranscription and translation lysates of the [35S]methionine-labeled hPRA1 or [35S]methionine-labeled rPRA1, which was produced using a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). The protein complex bound to the beads was then eluted with 2 × SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 3% dithiothreitol, 0.01 mg/ml bromphenol blue), subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Storm 840; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). N27-2 cells were transfected transiently with plasmids expressing HA-tagged WT hPRA1, hPRA1-(1–164), hPRA1-(30–185), or vector control. One day after transfection, the cells were incubated with 1 µg/ml Dox for 24 h to induce BHRF1 expression and then trypsinized and plated at 4000 cells per well in 96-well plates. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the cells were treated for 72 h with 0, 50, and 100 µm cisplatin to induce apoptosis. Cell viabilities were determined by WST-1 assay using cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) as specified by the manufacturer. This method is a colorimetric assay to quantitate cell proliferation and cell viability. The mechanism is based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt, WST-1 (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene di-sulfonate), by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells to form highly water-soluble formazan. To study effects of hPRA1 on Bcl-2, BHRF1, or BHRF1-(19–191), 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with HA-tagged WT hPRA1 and plasmids expressing Bcl-2, EBNA-1-tagged BHRF1, or BHRF1-(19–191), respectively. The transfectants were plated at 6000 cells per well in 96-well plates and treated for 24 h with 0, 40, and 80 µm cisplatin, and viability of the cells was also determined by WST-1 assays. Previous studies demonstrated that BHRF1 could protect cells from apoptosis triggered by a broad range of stimuli. To identify the cellular factors regulating the anti-apoptotic activity of BHRF1, we employed yeast two-hybrid screening with a cDNA library of human normal foreskin keratinocytes using BHRF1 as bait. Screening of over 20 million yeast transformants enabled the identification of 80 positive clones that interacted specifically and reproducibly with the BHRF1. DNA sequence analysis and BLAST searches of GenBankTM revealed that one of these clones encodes a DNA fragment homologous to a rat gene encoding prenylated rab acceptor 1 (rPRA1), a protein that associates with Rab and VAMP2 (53Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, a human PRA1 (hPRA1) gene was identified by Bucciet al. (47Bucci C. Chiariello M. Lattero D. Maiorano M. Bruni C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and its published cDNA sequence is identical to our BHRF1-interactive clone. To verify the specificity of the BHRF1-PRA1 interaction, full-length hPRA1 or rPRA1 was fused to GAL4-AD and subsequently co-transformed into L40 cells with the bait plasmid expressing LexA-DB-tagged NBHRF1. Protein expression of individual clones was confirmed by Western blotting using specific antibodies as shown in Fig.1, A-C. The two-hybrid assays"

Ecdysone. Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989Google Scholar). In immature stages of insects, the prothoracic glands are the major source of ecdysteroids, generally ecdysone (E),1 in most species. However, in most Lepidoptera examined, the major products of the glands are 3-dehydroecdysone (3DE), accompanied by varying proportions of ecdysone (2Warren J.T. Sakurai S. Rountree D.B. Gilbert L.I.

Biochem. 1996; 242: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The observation that interconversion of ecdysone and 3DE by prothoracic glands is not detectable in the cotton leafworm,Spodoptera littoralis, suggests that 3DE is likely to be an independent product of pathways of ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the glands (6Chen J.-H. Webb T.J. Powls R. Rees H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After secretion, 3DE undergoes reduction to ecdysone by NAD(P)H-linked 3DE 3β-reductase in the hemolymph (3Sakurai S. Warren J. Gilbert L.I. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 10: 179-197Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Kiriishi S. Rountree D.B. Sakurai S. Gilbert L.I. Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 57-64Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Chen J.-H.

Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989: 188-196Google Scholar). Ecdysone then undergoes 20-hydroxylation in certain peripheral tissues, yielding 20-hydroxyecdysone, which is considered to be the major active molting hormone in most insect species (8Rees H.H. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 9-39Google Scholar). At specific stages in development, the ecdysteroid titer exhibits obligatory, distinct peaks (9Steel C.G.H. Vafopoulou X. Koolman J. Ecdysone. Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989: 221-231Google Scholar). In immature stages, these result from increased ecdysteroid synthesis in the prothoracic glands, whereas decreases in titer arise from elevated ecdysteroid inactivation reactions in conjunction with enhanced excretion. Several transformations contribute to ecdysteroid inactivation (8Rees H.H. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 9-39Google Scholar), including the formation of 3-epi (3α-hydroxy) ecdysteroids, which are regarded as hormonally inactive (10Nigg H.N. Svoboda J.A. Thompson M.J. Kaplanis J.N.

Production of 3-epiecdysteroids occurs in many insect orders but appears to be prominent in lepidopteran midgut cytosol and entails conversion of ecdysteroid into 3-dehydroecdysteroid followed by NAD(P)H-dependent irreversible reduction to 3-epiecdysteroid (Fig.1 and Refs. 8Rees H.H.

J. 2000; 349: 239-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These reactions occur with both ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone. Ecdysone oxidase (EC 1.1.3.16) is the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ecdysteroid and was first demonstrated, characterized, and extensively purified from the blowfly, Calliphora vicina (17Koolman J. Karlson P. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1975; 356: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Koolman J. Karlson P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the 3-dehydroecdysteroid can also undergo NAD(P)H-dependent 3DE 3β-reductase-catalyzed reduction back to ecdysteroid (for reviews, see Refs. 8Rees H.H. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 9-39Google Scholar and 19Lafont R. Koolman J. Hoffmann J. Porchet M. Biosynthesis, Metabolism and Mode of Action of Invertebrate Hormones. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 196-226Crossref Google Scholar). The significance of such competitive reactions between ecdysone oxidase and 3DE 3β-reductase is uncertain. Furthermore, particularly puzzling is the occurrence of enzymes for reversible interconversion of ecdysteroid and their 3-dehydro-derivatives in tissues of several species that are incapable of producing 3-epiecdysteroids (12Milner N.P. Rees H.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Lafont R. Koolman J. Hoffmann J. Porchet M. Biosynthesis, Metabolism and Mode of Action of Invertebrate Hormones. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 196-226Crossref Google Scholar). As part of our studies aimed at elucidating the regulation of ecdysteroid titer, including the reactions involved in ecdysteroid inactivation in S. littoralis, we have cloned and characterized the cDNA encoding the 3DE 3β-reductase (hemolymph) (20Chen J.-H. Turner P.C. Rees H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10551-10556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and 3DE 3α-reductase (Malpighian tubules) (16Takeuchi H. Chen J.-H. O'Reilly D.R. Rees H.H. Turner P.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 239-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have purified ecdysone oxidase from S. littoralis midgut plus attached Malpighian tubules, and evidence suggests that the native enzyme consists of a trimer with apparent molecular mass of ∼190 kDa and subunit molecular mass of ∼64 kDa (21Chen J.-H. Powls R. Rees H.H. Wilkinson M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 899-908Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of the NH2 terminus as well as of interior tryptic peptides of the purified enzyme have been determined. We now report the molecular cloning, characterization and heterologous expression of the cDNA encoding ecdysone oxidase of S. littoralis together with the analysis of the organization of the corresponding gene and its promoter. Conceptual translation and amino acid sequence analysis indicates that ecdysone oxidase belongs to the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase superfamily. In fact, the ecdysone oxidase is novel in being, hitherto, the only eukaryotic animal steroid-metabolizing oxidase enzyme to be reported and characterized at the molecular level. By contrast, oxidation of steroids in vertebrates occurs via NAD(P)+-linked dehydrogenases. Ecdysone oxidase from S. littoralis was purified as described previously (21Chen J.-H. Powls R. Rees H.H. Wilkinson M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 899-908Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 10% gel, electrotransferred to ProBlott™ membrane, and visualized by Coomassie staining. A single band was observed that was excised and sequenced by an automated pulsed liquid-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems 471A), giving the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence asXYAVGGXAGAGPAATYVA (where X represents an unidentified amino acid). To obtain sequences of the interior region of the enzyme, the purified protein was excised from an SDS-PAGE gel and cleaved with trypsin. The resulting tryptic peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. The best internal sequence was ETPYXWXFTTIXXGVT. A PCR-based cloning strategy was used to isolate a cDNA fragment encoding the region between the two peptide sequences described above. Four degenerate primers were synthesized. Primers EO3-3 and EO-5 were designed on the basis of a part of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence (EO3-3, 5′-GTN GGN GCI GGI CCI GC, where I represents inosine, and N is A, T, C, or G; EO-5, 5′-GCN GGI CCN GCI GCN ACN TAY GT, where Y represents T or C); primers EO-AS3-2 and EO-AS3-3 were designed based on the internal proteolytic peptide fragment (EO-AS3-2, 5′- ATI GTI GTR AAI NIC CAI NIR TAI GG, where R represents A or G; EO-AS3–3, 5′-GTI GTR AAI NIC CAI NIR TAI GGI GT). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Ltd.) from midgut dissected from larvae at 18 h into the last larval instar. First-strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from the total RNA using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with random primer p(dN)6 supplied with the kit. cDNA synthesized with random primer served as the template for PCR in which the above degenerate primers were used. PCR was carried out as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 47 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 7 min using EO3-3 and EO-AS3-2 primers. This PCR product was used as a template for nested PCR, which was carried out as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 7 min using EO-5 and EO-AS3-3 primers. The nested PCR yielded a product of ∼300 bp. The purified PCR product was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy Vector (Promega, Ltd.). Transformants were screened by colony PCR using M13 forward and reverse primers (5′-GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA G and 5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC, respectively), those showing the correct size of inserts were propagated in LB broth containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and plasmid DNA was purified after a 16-h incubation at 37 °C. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy termination method using Sequenase Version 2.0 (usb™, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequences of three independent clones were compared to detect errors that could have occurred during the reverse transcription and PCR amplification. 5′-RACE was carried out to obtain the 5′-end of the cDNA. For this, mRNA from total RNA was isolated using a Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Dynal Ltd.). A 5′-RACE system, Version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Ltd.) was used to amplify the 5′-terminus of the message for sequencing. Briefly, a gene-specific primer 1 (5′-CTT TCA AGG TTT GTC TTA A), designed on the basis of the sequence of the PCR product, was hybridized to the mRNA, and cDNA was synthesized using SUPERSCRIPT™ II reverse transcriptase. The RNA was then degraded with RNase mix (RNase H and RNase T1), and the cDNA was purified using a GlassMax spin cartridge supplied with the kit. A poly(dC) tail was added to the 3′ terminus of the purified cDNA using dCTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and the cDNA region corresponding to the 5′-end of the mRNA was amplified by two successive rounds of PCR using additional gene-specific primers 2 and 3 (5′-CCG GTA CAA TGC TCT CCT and 5′-GGT TCG GTC CTG CTT CTA, respectively), together with the anchor primers supplied by the manufacturer. The second round PCR yielded a product of ∼400 bp, which was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy Vector, and the nucleotide sequences of several clones were determined. The genomic library was constructed using a Lambda FIX® II/XhoI partial fill-in vector kit (Stratagene). The genomic DNA was prepared from the fat body and Malpighian tubules of S. littoralis in the last larval instar using a modified phenol extraction method as described in (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). It was partially digested withSau3AI, and the first two nucleotides of the 3′ termini were filled in. The genomic DNA fragments were ligated into the Lambda FIX® II arms and packaged with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene). Hybridization to the genomic library was performed for 18 h at 40 °C in 6× SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 µg/ml denatured, fragmented salmon sperm DNA, and a32P-labeled DNA fragment produced using EO-5 and EO-AS3-3 primers as a probe. Membranes were washed at low stringency (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 40 °C). The positive clones were analyzed by restriction digestion. The restriction fragments were subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) and sequenced. The transcription initiation site of ecdysone oxidase mRNA has been determined using the solid phase CapFinder approach (23Schramm G. Bruchhaus I. Roeder T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: e96Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). mRNA from total RNA was isolated using a Dynabeads mRNA purification kit and used to synthesize a solid-phase cDNA library with CapFinder Primer (5′- AAG CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA GTG GCC ATT ATG GCC GGG). The RNA was then degraded with RNase H, and the immobilized cDNA was purified by using a magnet. The cDNA region corresponding to the 5′-end of the mRNA was amplified by two successive rounds of PCR using gene-specific primers 4 and 5 (5′-GTT CGG TCC TGC TTC TAG CAG CA and 5′-CAC GCT GAA GCG GTT CTC CT, respectively) together with the 5′-primer (5′- AAG CAG TGG TAT C AA CGC AGA GT). The second-round PCR yielded a product of ∼400 bp, which was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector, and the nucleotide sequences of several clones were determined. Total RNA from various tissues was isolated using TRIzol reagent. mRNA was isolated from total RNA using a Dynabeads mRNA purification kit. 10 µg of total RNA or 200 ng of mRNA was fractionated on a formaldehyde/agarose gel, transferred to Electran® nylon membrane (Merck), and hybridized with a probe corresponding to the open reading frame of the ecdysone oxidase cDNA. The probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Ready-To-Go™ DNA-labeling kit (-dCTP) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and loading was normalized by probing with a mouse 18 S ribosomal RNA probe when using total RNA or with a S. littoralis muscle actin partial fragment corresponding to the coding region 2H. Takeuchi, J.-H. Chen, D. R. O'Reilly, P. C. Turner, and H. H. Rees, unpublished data. when using mRNA. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out using ULTRAhyb™ (Ambion, Inc.) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The blots were washed at low stringency (2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 40 °C), and labeled bands were visualized by autoradiography. Genomic DNA was prepared as described above. 10-µg aliquots of DNA were digested with BamHI, EcoRI,HindIII, or SalI, fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized using radiolabeled probes corresponding to different regions of ecdysone oxidase cDNA. Hybridization was carried out in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, and 100 µg/ml denatured, fragmented salmon sperm DNA at 55 °C overnight. The blot was washed at low stringency (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 40 °C), and labeled bands were visualized by autoradiography. Due to difficulty in amplifying the full length of the coding region, two fragments (115–1634 and 1589–1914) were amplified using reverse transcriptase-PCR separately, which were subsequently digested withEcoRV and ligated. For this PCR step, PLATINUM® Pfx DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. This cDNA containing the complete open reading frame of ecdysone oxidase was inserted into pSynXIV VI+X3 vector (24O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). This construct was cotransfected into Sf21 cells (∼2 × 106 cells) with vSynVI−gal DNA (24O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Recombination between viral sequences flanking ecdysone oxidase cDNA in pSynXIV VI+X3 and homologous sequences in the viral genome resulted in the replacement of the β-galactosidase in vSynVI−gal with the entire ecdysone oxidase cDNA and a functional polyhedrin gene. The recombinant viruses were identified by screening based on their β-galactosidase-negative, occlusion-body-positive plaque phenotype. Their structures were confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis followed by Southern blotting. Procedures used for maintenance of Sf21 cells for propagation of vSynVI−gal and for the construction and characterization of recombinant viruses are described in O'Reilly et al. (24O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). 2 × 106 High Five™ cells infected at the multiplicity of infection of 10 with wild typeAutographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus or with recombinant baculovirus were homogenized at different times post-infection in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% NaN3. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 170,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction. 5 µl of each fraction was added to an equal volume of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before loading onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained to allow visualization of the protein. Assay of the recombinant ecdysone oxidase activity was performed in triplicate by modification of the method described in Chen et al. (21Chen J.-H. Powls R. Rees H.H. Wilkinson M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 899-908Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 2 × 106High Five™ cells infected at the multiplicity of infection of 10 with either wild type or recombinant baculovirus were homogenized at 70 h post-infection in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% NaN3. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 170,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosol fraction. A 5-µl aliquot was assayed by incubation for 10 min at 40 °C in a 50-µl assay mixture consisting of 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 60 µmecdysone. Assays were quenched with 50 µl of methanol, and proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Three independent experiments were performed for each assay, with all assays carried out in duplicate. Injections were made via dorsal segments, and injection sites were sealed with low melting point wax. RH-5992 or 20-hydroxyecdysone was administered to the larvae in methanol (2 µl) as double injections (1 µg of RH-5992 or 4 µg of 20-hydroxyecdysone per insect) at 42 and 48 h into the sixth instar. Methanol-injected larvae served as controls. For the kinetic study of ecdysone oxidase, the reactions were performed as described above, but for 5 min, and included 1.85 kBq of [23,24-3H2]ecdysone and various concentrations of unlabeled ecdysone (15Webb T.J. Powls R. Rees H.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 809-816Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ecdysteroids were analyzed by HPLC through a C18 Nova-Pak cartridge (10 cm × 5 mm; Waters Associates) on a Waters instrument (Waters Associates) linked to a 440 ultraviolet detector set at 254 nm and eluted with an isocratic solvent system consisting of acetonitrile:0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water (22:78 (v/v)) at 1 ml/min (21Chen J.-H. Powls R. Rees H.H. Wilkinson M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 899-908Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A PCR-based cloning strategy, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” allowed us to obtain a cDNA fragment corresponding to the sequence between nucleotides 139 and 434 in Fig.2. Gene-specific primers derived from this sequence were synthesized and used for 5′-RACE to obtain the 5′-end of the cDNA. 5′-RACE produced a cDNA clone of ∼390 bp that contained a putative translation start site at position 115. A genomic library prepared from mixed tissues of S. littoralis was screened with the initial 295-bp fragment, resulting in isolation of three clones. Restriction digestion and Southern blot analysis suggested that the three clones were identical. Gene-specific primers derived from the sequence of the genomic clone were synthesized and used for reverse transcriptase-PCR and 3′-RACE. The amplified products were cloned and sequenced. Taken together, all overlapping cDNAs span a total of 2.8 kb. The polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is located at position 2838. As shown in Fig. 2, using the first ATG as the start codon, the full-length ecdysone oxidase cDNA encodes a protein of 599 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 65206.1, which is consistent with its apparentMr observed in our SDS-PAGE analysis (21Chen J.-H. Powls R. Rees H.H. Wilkinson M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 899-908Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This conceptually translated protein starts with MCYAVGGC and is consistent with the NH2-terminal fragment sequence we determined ofXYAVGGX, assuming that the initial methionine has been cleaved as is commonly observed (25Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The first Cys residue may have been obscured due to the generally high background in the first sequencing cycle coupled with poor sensitivity of detection of this residue. The protein is mildly acidic with an estimated pI of 5.82. Genomic DNA was prepared from combined fat body and Malpighian tubules and digested with various restriction enzymes, of which SalI andBamHI cleavage sites are found in the ecdysone oxidase genomic clone, whereas EcoRI and HindIII sites are not. The resultant DNA fragments were analyzed by Southern blot using probes representing different regions of the cDNA. As shown in Fig. 3, two bands were observed inBamHI (∼2.6 and 2.3 kb) and SalI (∼5 and 1 kb)-digested samples when the blot was subjected to hybridization with a probe, representing the whole coding region of ecdysone oxidase cDNA. However, when the same blot was re-probed with a cDNA fragment that corresponded to the NH2-terminal region, essentially only one band was detected in all samples. Again, a probe that represents the COOH-terminal region detected only one band in each case; in the case of EcoRI and HindIII, only a large band was observed. This analysis is most simply interpreted if ecdysone oxidase is encoded by a single-copy gene in the S. littoralis genome. A weak band of 2.6 kb in the SalI digests of Figs. 3, A and C, is most probably due to a polymorphic SalI site downstream of the gene, since this genomic DNA was prepared from 10 individuals. The genomic sequence of ecdysone oxidase showed that the mRNA was encoded by 5 exons. Exons 3, 4, and 5 contain the coding region (Fig.4 A), and all exon-intron boundaries followed the “GT-AG rule” for splice donor and acceptor sequences. A MOTIF (motif.genome.ad.jp) search revealed that the 5′-flanking region of the transcription initiation site contains the arthropod cap-site motif (26Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) at −1, a putative TATA box motif at −28, a putative Broad-Complex binding motif (27von Kalm L. Crossgrove K. Von Seggern D. Guild G.M. Beckendorf S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) at −578, and CF2 binding motifs (28Gogos J.A. Hsu T. Bolton J. Kafatos F.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1951-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) at −35 and −65 (Fig. 4 B). There is a repeat sequence (TTA)6 at −285 that is likely to be a microsatellite sequence. However, the 11-bp motif (CT(G/C)A(G/C)AGTAN(A/T)) is repeated 5 times at −548, −226, −171, −131, and −107, and since it resembles the binding motif for FTZ-F1, a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (29Lavorgna G. Ueda H. Clos J. Wu C. Science. 1991; 252: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 30Ayer S. Benyajati C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is very likely that the ecdysone oxidase in S. littoralis is regulated by a factor of this type. The deduced amino acid sequence of the coding region showed similarity to enzymes in the GMC oxidoreductase family (Fig. 5) such as Drosophila melanogaster glucose dehydrogenase (49%),Drosophila pseudoobscura glucose dehydrogenase (49%),Escherichia coli choline dehydrogenase (47%),Rhizobium meliloti choline dehydrogenase (45%),Pseudomonas oleovorans alcohol dehydrogenase (45%),Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase (38%) and Prunus serotina (R)-mandelonitrile lyase isoform 1 (40%). The ecdysone oxidase amino acid sequence exhibited features characteristic of the proteins of the GMC oxidoreductase family (31Cavener D.R. J. Mol.

For the molecular anatomy of this multifunctional enzyme, we have established a simultaneous expression of three P proteins in cultured insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. For purification of P protein complexes, the PA protein was expressed as a fusion with a histidine tag added at its N terminus. By using affinity chromatography, a complex consisting of the three P proteins was isolated from nuclear extracts of virus-infected cells. The affinity-purified 3P complex showed the activities of capped RNA binding, capped RNA cleavage, viral model RNA binding, model RNA-directed RNA synthesis, and polyadenylation of newly synthesized RNA. We conclude that a functional form of the viral RNA polymerase with the catalytic specificity of transcriptase is formed in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. Using the viral RNA-free 3P complex, we found that the capped RNA cleavage takes place in the presence of vRNA but not of cRNA, indicating that the vRNA functions as a regulatory factor for the specificity control of viral RNA polymerase as well as a template for transcription.

Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that this RNA polymerase is involved in both transcription (vRNA-directed mRNA synthesis) and replication (vRNA-directed synthesis of complementary RNA (cRNA) and cRNA-directed vRNA synthesis) (5Ishihama A.

The RNA polymerase also carries an apparent proofreading activity for nascent RNA chains (16Ishihama A. Mizumoto K. Kawakami K. Kato A. Honda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10417-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA polymerase is composed of one molecule each of three viral proteins, PB1, PB2, and PA (17Horisberger M.A. Virology. 1980; 107: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Honda A.

The PB1 protein plays a central role in RNA polymerase assembly by providing the contact surfaces for both PB2 and PA (19Toyoda T. Adyshev D.M. Kobayashi M. Iwata A. Ishihama A. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2149-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the virus particles, this RNA polymerase is bound at a double-stranded region of vRNA formed by base pairing between its 5′- and 3′-termini (20Honda A. Ueda K. Nagata K. Ishihama A. J. Biochem. 1987; 102: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Hsu M.-T. Parvin J.D. Gupta S. Krystal M. Palese P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Since the RNA polymerase is tightly associated with vRNA (18Honda A. Mukaigawa J. Yokoiyama A. Kato A. Ueda S. Nagata K. Krystal M. Nayak D. Ishihama A. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and since the content of RNA polymerase in virions is very low, i.e. less than 1% of total virion proteins (1Palese P. Kingsbury D.W. Genetics of Influenza Viruses. Springer-Verlag, Vienna1983Crossref Google Scholar, 22Kawakami K. Ishihama A. Hamaguchi M. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 17571-18751Google Scholar), no purification method yielding large amounts of the functional RNA polymerase has been established. Previously Kobayashi et al. (23Kobayashi M. Tuchiya K. Nagata K. Ishihama A. Virus Res. 1992; 22: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the viral RNA polymerase with RNA synthesis activity could be reconstitutedin vitro from three P proteins individually purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells, whereas Szewczyket al. (24Szewczyk B. Laver W.G. Summers D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) succeeded in recovering active RNA polymerase after renaturation of the P proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. In both cases, however, it was not enough to yield the efficient reconstitution of functional RNA polymerase in vitro. At present, therefore, the available methods for the analysis of structure-function relationships of this complex enzyme are limited. For detailed analysis of the structure-function relationship of each P protein, large quantities of the RNA-free form of functional RNA polymerase are essential. Here we show that all three P proteins simultaneously expressed in insect cells after coinfection of recombinant baculoviruses are assembled into a complex (the complex consisting of three P proteins is hereafter designated as “3P complex”). The isolated 3P complex was found to be active in viral model RNA-directed RNA synthesis and capped RNA cleavage. Using the 3P complex, we also found that the capped RNA cleavage takes place only when the 3P complex binds to vRNA but not cRNA. RNA elements for the expression of RNA polymerase functions were then analyzed using a set of variant model RNAs. Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus was used for construction of recombinant viruses. The construction of recombinant baculoviruses for expression of PB1 and PB2 was described previously (23Kobayashi M. Tuchiya K. Nagata K. Ishihama A. Virus Res. 1992; 22: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To construct recombinant virus for expression of PA with a His tag at N terminus, the cDNA for PA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted between the NcoI and BglII sites of pAcHLT-B (Pharmigen). The resulting plasmid DNA (pAcHLTPA) was co-transfected with linearized baculovirus DNA into Sf9 insect cells using the liposome method. After 96 h of culture at 28 °C, the supernatant was harvested and used for infection of Sf9 cells. After 96 h of culture, the titer of recombinant virus RBVH-PA in the culture medium reached to approximately108 plaque-forming units/ml as determined by plaque assay. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells and Trichoplusia ni Tn5 cells were used for recombinant baculovirus infection. Sf9 were grown in Grace medium with 5% serum, whereas Tn5 were grown in a serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Tn5 or Sf9 cells were coinfected with three species of the recombinant baculovirus each at a m.o.i. (multiplicity of infection) of 2. After 4 days of culture, 108 cells were harvested, suspended in 5 ml of a disruption buffer that contained 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,000 rpm and then homogenized in 3 ml of a nuclear extraction buffer that contained 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol. The homogenate was incubated for 30 min on ice with stirring and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 2 h. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was mixed with metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with constant rotation. The resin was washed with a washing buffer that contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole until proteins could not be detected as measured with a UV spectrometer and then eluted with an elution buffer that contained 50 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 100 mm imidazole. Proteins eluted were analyzed by SDS, 8% PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). P proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Nippon Genetics) in 10 mm CAPS buffer (pH 11) containing 10% methanol. The blotted filters were incubated with anti-PA, anti-PB1, and anti-PB2 antibodies and then with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, which was detected by staining with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dojin). Anti-P protein antibodies were raised in rabbits against each P protein purified from Escherichia coli BL21-expressing recombinant P proteins under the control of T7 promoter. 2Y. Asano and A. Ishihama, unpublished information. In vitro RNA synthesis was carried out for 60 min at 30 °C in 50 µl of the standard reaction mixture, which contained 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.25 mmeach ATP, GTP, and CTP, 4 µm UTP, 10 µCi [α-32P]UTP, 2.5 µg of bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mm ApG or 250 ng of globin mRNA, 1 unit of RNasin (Promega), and 1 pmol of v53 (53-nucleotide-long vRNA (v-sense or negative-strand RNA)) or c53 (53-nucleotide-long cRNA (c-sense or positive-strand RNA)) model RNA template (see “Preparation of Model RNA Templates” below for the preparation of model RNAs). Transcripts were electrophrased on 10% PAGE in the presence of 7 murea, and the gels were exposed to imaging plates to analyze with the BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). The purified 3P complex and radioactive RNA (about 10,000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 µl of RNA binding buffer that contained 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 10 µg of tRNA. After UV irradiation for 30 min on ice, anti-PB1 was added, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 1 h. Antigen-antibody complexes formed were recovered after incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on ice for 1 h. The protein A-Sepharose complexes were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then subjected to SDS, 8% PAGE. Gels were analyzed as above. Cross-linking of capped RNA to the P proteins was carried out essentially as described in Honda et al. (25Honda A. Mizumoto K. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Capped mRNA with 32P only at 5′ cap-1 structure (about 1,000 cpm) and the 3P complex or RNP were incubated in 50 µl of reaction mixture containing v-sense model RNA, 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1 unit of RNasin (Promega) at 30 °C for 30 min and then exposed to UV for 30 min (26Mahy B.W.J. Barrett T. Nichol S.T. Penn C.R. Wolstenholme A.J. Bishop D.H.L. Compans R.W The Replication of Negative Stranded Viruses. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1981: 379-384Google Scholar). The RNA-cross-linked proteins were digested with RNase A and RNase T1 and then incubated with anti-PB2 at 37 °C for 1 h. Antigen-antibody complexes formed were precipitated after incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h on ice. The precipitates were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and fractionated by electrophoresis on SDS, 8% gels. The gels were analyzed as above. The purified 3P complex was incubated in 50 µl of the reaction mixture, which contained 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Triton X-100, 2.5 µg of bovine serum albumin, and radioactive capped RNA with 32P only at the 5′ cap structure (about 2,000 cpm) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction products were extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed by 12% PAGE in the presence of 7 murea (10Kawakami K. Mizumoto K. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 11: 3637-3649Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The gel was analyzed as above. Oligotex (dT)25(Takara) was added to the reaction mixtures for in vitro RNA synthesis and incubated at 75 °C for 10 min. The heat-treated mixtures were placed on ice for 5 min, and then 5 m NaCl was added to a final concentration of 500 mm. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 rpm. Precipitates were washed with 10 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.5m NaCl, and 0.05% SDS and resuspended in 0.1 ml of distilled water. RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and then analyzed by PAGE in the presence of 7m urea. The model templates, v53 and c53, were synthesized by transcribing pV53 and pC53 plasmid DNA, respectively, with T7 RNA polymerase (27Parvin J.D. Palese P. Honda A. Ishihama A. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive v53 and c53 RNAs were prepared by transcribing pV53 and pC53 DNA in the presence of radioactive substrates. Two types of radioactive capped RNA, globin mRNA and capped poly(A), with 32P only at cap-1 structure, were synthesized. For radiolabeling, globin mRNA was subjected to one cycle of decapping and recapping reactions in the presence of [α-32P]GTP using vaccinia virus capping enzyme (Life Technologies, Inc.), whereas poly(A) was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and then capped in the presence of [α-32P]GTP using yeast-capping enzyme (28Ito N. Yamada H. Kaziro Y. Mizumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1989-1996PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses for the expression of three different P protein subunits of influenza virus RNA polymerase were constructed using cDNAs that were synthesized from vRNA segments 1, 2, and 3, each encoding PB2, PB1, and PA protein, respectively. For the purpose of the 3P complex purification, PA was expressed as a fusion with a histidine (His) tag sequence of 40 amino acids in length, added at its N terminus. As expected from the finding that the N-terminal sequence of PA is not involved in subunit-subunit contact (19Toyoda T. Adyshev D.M. Kobayashi M. Iwata A. Ishihama A. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2149-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the addition of this His tag did not interfere with the assembly and activity of RNA polymerase (see below). The construction of recombinant baculoviruses for PB1 and PB2 production was described previously (22Kawakami K. Ishihama A. Hamaguchi M. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 17571-18751Google Scholar). To check the expression of the P proteins, the recombinant baculoviruses were infected individually or in various combinations into Sf9 cells, and the whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunostaining with specific polyclonal antibodies against each P protein. When the recombinant baculovirus RBVH-PA was singly infected, a band cross-reactive against anti-PA was detected in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions following SDS, 8% PAGE (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and3). The migration of H-PA (His-tagged PA) was slightly slower than the authentic PA without the His tag (Fig. 1 A,lane 1). We could not detect any immunostained band in mock-infected cell extracts (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and5). Likewise, the expression of PB1 and PB2 was detected after single infection with the corresponding recombinant virus (data not shown). When all three recombinant viruses, RBVPB1, RBVPB2, and RBVH-PA, were coinfected into Sf9 cells, the expression of not only H-PA but also PB1 and PB2 were detected after immunostaining with anti-PB1 (Fig. 1 B) and anti-PB2 (Fig. 1 C), respectively. PB1 and PB2 were again recovered in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. To examine whether the three viral P proteins form complexes in insect cells, the three recombinant baculoviruses were coinfected (at a m.o.i. of 2 for each virus) into Tn5 cells (note that the expression levels of P proteins were higher for Tn5 than Sf9 (Fig. 1 E)). After SDS, 8% PAGE of the whole cell lysates, the expression of all three P proteins was confirmed by immunostaining using polyclonal antibodies against each P protein (see Fig. 1). Since the recovery was higher for the nuclear fraction than the cytoplasmic fraction, attempts were made to purify P protein complexes from the nuclear fraction. Nuclei were solubilized with a low concentration of a non-ionic detergent, and the nuclear extract was prepared after centrifugation for 1 h at 45,000 rpm. The supernatant was directly subjected to metal affinity resin purification. Proteins eluted with 100 mm imidazole were fractionated by SDS, 8% PAGE, and the gel was stained with CBB. Three stained bands were detected (Fig.1 D, lane 3) that cross-reacted with anti-PB1, anti-PA, and anti-PB2 antibodies in this order. Both PB1 and PB2 migrated on SDS-PAGE with the same mobility as the corresponding authentic proteins associated with viral RNP cores (compare Fig.1 D, lanes 1 and 3). On the other hand, the H-PA migrated as fast as the recombinant H-PA recovered from RBVH-PA virus-infected cells (Fig. 1 D, lane 2) but more slowly than the RNP-associated untagged authentic PA (Fig.1 D, lane 1). Thus we conclude that at least some of the PB1 and PB2 molecules are associated with the His-tagged PA protein. To set up a high level expression system for these influenza virus P proteins, we next compared their expression levels in two insect cell lines, Tn5 and Sf9, that were cultured under the same conditions at 28 °C. After metal affinity resin purification and SDS-PAGE, all three P proteins were detectable for both preparations even by CBB staining (Fig. 1 E). From the staining intensity, the 3P complex is composed of nearly equal amounts of three P proteins. Since the expression level in Tn5 cells was higher than that in Sf9, we hereafter used Tn5 for large scale purification of the 3P complex. Based on the CBB-staining intensity, the purification yield of the 3P complex was estimated to be about 5 µg from 107cells. The influenza virus RNA polymerase solubilized from viral RNP cores shows RNA synthesis activity in the presence of exogenously added model vRNA templates, which carry terminal conserved sequences of viral RNA segments (29Scholtissek C. Murphy B.R. Arch. Virol. 1992; 58: 323-333Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The RNA synthesis activity of the 3P complex purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells was tested using two model templates, v-sense (minus-strand) v53 and c-sense (plus-strand) c53, each consisting of 53 nucleotides, and two primers, dinucleotide ApG and globin mRNA. When ApG was used as a primer, RNA products were detected for both v53- and c53-directed reactions (Fig.2 A). The major product in v53-directed reaction migrated on PAGE in the presence of 7m urea as fast as the template v53 (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 8), whereas the major transcript in c53-directed reaction migrated faster than the template c53 (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 6). The small-sized RNA may represent a transcript initiated at an internal ApG-binding site within the cRNA template. The nuclear extract of mock-infected cells was unable to synthesize RNA (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the RNA synthesis as detected with the 3P complex fraction represents the activity of the influenza virus RNA polymerase formed in recombinant virus-infected insect cells but not of cellular enzymes. This prediction was confirmed by the finding that the 3P complex is unable to synthesize RNA when unrelated RNAs without the viral promoter sequences were used as template (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the 3P complex is able to recognize vRNA, as does the native viral RNA polymerase. Influenza virus RNA polymerase is interconvertible between transcriptase and replicase, but the capped RNA-primed initiation of RNA synthesis is a unique property of the transcriptase (5Ishihama A. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 6Honda A. Ishihama A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 483-488PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the replicase form of RNA polymerase is considered to initiate RNA synthesis de novo without using primers because the replication product or vRNA in virus particles retains 5′-triphosphate (30Honda A. Mizumoto K. Ishihama A. Virus Res. 1998; 55: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the absence of primer addition, a low level of RNA synthesis was detected for the v53-directed reaction (compare Fig.2 A, lanes 7 and 8). With the use of the c53 template, the 3P complex is virtually inactive in unprimed RNA synthesis (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Thus, we propose that the 3P complex formed in insect cell represents the transcriptase form of viral RNA polymerase. When in vitro RNA synthesis reaction was carried out using globin mRNA as a primer, products were detected only for the v53 template (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5and 6). Since the globin mRNA preparation used in this experiment was heterogenous in size and 5′ terminal structure, it was difficult to estimate the efficiency of transcription initiation between the synthetic primer ApG and the natural primer-capped RNA. Transcripts from the globin mRNA-primed reaction were heterogenous in size, but the majority migrated slower than a marker RNA of 100 nucleotides in length). In capped RNA-primed transcription, the capped oligonucleotides of 10–12 nucleotides in length generated after cleavage of capped RNA by the viral RNA polymerase-associated endonuclease (7Bouloy M. Plotch S.J. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4886-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Beaton A.R. Krug R.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 11: 3637-3649Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Shaw M.W. Lamb R.A. Virus Res. 1984; 1: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were used as primers for transcription initiation and remain associated with the 5′ termini of transcripts. Thus, the size of transcripts in the v53-directed and globin mRNA-primed reaction should be as long as 63–65 nucleotides. Some of the transcripts formed in v53-directed and globin mRNA-primed reaction by the 3P complex were, however, longer than the 100-nucleotide-long marker (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5and6), implying that transcripts contain various sizes of the poly(A) sequence. To test whether the slowly migrating RNAs carry poly(A) sequences, in vitro transcripts were mixed with oligo(dT)25 resin, and the resin-bound RNAs were eluted by heat treatment in the presence of high concentrations of salt. After 6% PAGE in the presence of 7 m urea, radioactive RNAs were detected, of which the majority migrated slower than the marker RNA of about 100 nucleotides in length (Fig.2 B, lanes 5 and 6). Some of the ApG-primed transcripts also bound to the oligo(dT)25 resin, but the sizes of these RNAs were shorter than the marker RNA (Fig.2 B, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that at least some of the RNA products formed on the vRNA model template in the presence of either ApG or mRNA primers contain A-rich sequences. Influenza virus RNA polymerase is associated with duplexes formed by both 5′- and 3′-terminal sequences of vRNA segments (20Honda A. Ueda K. Nagata K. Ishihama A. J. Biochem. 1987; 102: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Hsu M.-T. Parvin J.D. Gupta S. Krystal M. Palese P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and recognizes specific sequences located at 5′- and 3′-termini of vRNA and cRNA (31Seong B.L. Brownlee G.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 3115-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Fodor E. Seong B.L. Brownlee G.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These sequences are conserved among eight RNA segments and provide the initiation sites for transcription and replication (5Ishihama A. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 6Honda A. Ishihama A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 483-488PubMed Google Scholar). Some intrinsic activities of the RNA polymerase are exposed only after binding to these transcription promoter or replication origin sequences (33Hagen M. Chung T.D. Butcher J.A. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cianci C. Tiley L. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3995-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Li M.L. Ramirez B.C. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5844-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Distinct regions of the PB1 subunit are involved in the recognition of vRNA and cRNA (35Li M.L. Ramirez B.C. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5844-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 36Gonzalez S. Ortin J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To examine the RNA recognition specificity of the 3P complex, we then analyzed its binding activity to vRNA and cRNA. Radiolabeled model templates, v53 and c53, and an unrelated TMV RNA of similar size were incubated with the 3P complex for 30 min at 30 °C in the transcription assay mixture without substrates, then exposed for 30 min to UV light for cross-linking. After treatment with RNases, the 3P complex was immunoprecipitated with a combination of anti-PB1 and protein A, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS, 8% PAGE. Both vRNA (Fig.3, lanes 2 and 3) and cRNA (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6) model templates were cross-linked to the 3P complex to the same extent, but no cross-linked product was detected for the unrelated TMV RNA (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 9). These results support the notion that the 3P complex formed in insect cells carries the recognition activity of specific sequences on both vRNA and cRNA. One unique feature of influenza virus growth is that host cell-capped RNA is used as a source of primers for the initiation of viral transcription (4Krug R.M. Alonso-Caplen F.V. Julkenun I. Katze M.G. Krug R.M. The influenza Viruses. Plenum Press, New York1989: 89-152Crossref Google Scholar). Even more remarkably, the influenza virus RNA polymerase itself is able to cleave the capped RNA at specific positions near the 5′ cap structure (5Ishihama A. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 6Honda A. Ishihama A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 483-488PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that globin mRNA could serve as a primer for transcription by the 3P complex itself (see Fig.2B) indicates that this complex also carries the activities of capped RNA binding and cleavage. To confirm this prediction, we next investig"

Investigation of the mechanism of membrane fusion showed that the solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein receptor (SNARE)1 protein family plays essential roles in this process.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3293-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Littleton J.T. Chapman E.R. Kreber R. Garment M.B. Carlson S.D. Ganetzky B. Neuron. 1998; 21: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).SNAREs are thought to drive or catalyze membrane fusion. Recent studies using purified SNARE proteins in synthetic liposomes have shed light on the potential mechanical driving mechanism of SNAREs. Increasing the length of the linker between the transmembrane domain and the conserved helical domain of SNAREs decreased the liposome fusion efficiency (19McNew J.A. Weber T. Engelman D.M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 415-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacement of transmembrane anchors of syntaxin and VAMP with short covalently attached lipids prevented lipid mixing without detriment to the liposome docking, suggesting that membranes do not simply fuse passively when held together (6McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus SNAREs appear to exert force on their membrane anchors by pulling on the linker and transmembrane domains, thus actively promoting lipid rearrangement and fusion. This force is almost certainly derived from the assembly of the parallel core complex bridging the two membranes. It was shown in the cracked PC12 cell system that mutating the conserved hydrophobic residues that are important for core complex formation resulted in decreased thermostability of core complexes and also dramatically impaired the ability to function in exocytosis (14Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).Despite general agreement as to the major function of SNARE proteins, the sequence of events leading to complex assembly and bilayer fusion remain unclear. Some recent reports suggest that SNAREs interact prior to lipid mixing, perhaps as a partially assembled complex. Studies using synthetic liposomes and synaptosomes led to the same conclusion that SNAREs form complexes prior to the actual lipid and content mixing, although opposite conclusions were drawn as to whether NSF and α-SNAP disrupt such complexes (20Weber T. Parlati F. McNew J.A. Johnston R.J. Westermann B. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Lonart G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27703-27707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies using adrenal chromaffin cells showed that SNARE complexes exist in a dynamic equilibrium between a loose and a tight form before the arrival of the Ca2+ trigger, with the two forms leading to fusion with rate constants of 300 and 30 ms, respectively (15Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In crayfish neurons, an N-terminally zippered, C-terminally unzippered SNARE complex was suggested to exist prior to the fusion trigger (22Hua S.Y. Charlton M.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our recent results using the cracked PC12 cell system predict the existence of a reversibly assembled SNARE complex, with which the syntaxin coil is perhaps only loosely associated before the arrival of Ca2+ (23Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). If the full assembly of the SNARE complex is mechanically coupled to lipid fusion, a completely assembled four-helical bundle as in the crystal structure (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) should not exist before the fusion event itself and should only be the end product of the fusion event. Thus a clear distinction has to be made between a tight helical bundle complex and a partially assembled complex, as more than one kind of SNARE complex likely exists.A useful tool in studying exocytosis is a series of potent neurotoxins, botulinum and tetanus toxins, that proteolytically cleave SNARE (24Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) cleaves the SNAP-25 C-terminal helix (aa 142–206) between residues 180 and 181, removing a 26-amino acid peptide from the C terminus of SNAP-25 (25Binz T. Blasi J. Yamasaki S. Baumeister A. Link E. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Niemann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1617-1620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BoNT/E-cleaved SNAP-25 is incapable of forming an SDS-resistant SNARE complex (10Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells is abolished. We have shown previously that this inhibition can be reversed by adding a recombinant 65-mer SNAP-25 C-terminal coil (S25C) (14Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The added coil displaces the remaining half of the endogenous S25C coil (aa 142–180) and participates in SNARE complex formation as a complete new S25C coil. In the current study, we show that a peptide encompassing only aa 181–206 of SNAP-25, the 26-aa C terminus that is cleaved by BoNT/E, is also able to rescue exocytosis from BoNT/E-treated PC12 cells, albeit at higher concentrations than the full-length coil. This surprising finding prompted us to investigate the in vitro requirements for a functional SNARE complex, providing further insight into the mechanism of SNARE-mediated fusion. We also mutated each residue to alanine to study the functional contribution of each amino acid in this 26-aa region to SNAP-25 function.DISCUSSIONWe show that the SNAP-25 C-terminal 26-aa peptide can rescue BoNT/E-inhibited exocytosis. That a discontinuous S25C coil is able to function was initially surprising. Combined with the finding that the VAMP N-terminal peptide does not rescue BoNT/D-inhibited exocytosis, these results suggest that SNAP-25 likely promotes membrane fusion by contributing two cytoplasmic α-helices to stabilize the core complex, without directly doing work on the membranes. The lipid reorganization required for bilayer fusion is perhaps carried out by the two transmembrane SNAREs, syntaxin and VAMP, which can pull their membrane anchors upon core complex zippering (6McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Presumably the fact that two separate fragments of S25C with correct side chain arrangements can effectively rescue exocytosis means that no such force is transduced along the SNAP-25 C-terminal coil.The in vitro properties of the SNARE core complexes, most often SDS resistance and thermostability, have been used to predict their function inside cells. Whereas the normal core complex is known to be SDS-resistant and highly thermostable, we found that the core complex containing a discontinuous SNAP-25 coil is no longer SDS-resistant and much less stable. This is perhaps to be expected, given the structural disruption to the carbon backbone. We also found previously that if a core complex contains noncognate SNAREs or SNAP-25 mutations at non-“a/d” positions, the thermostability of the complex does not correlate with its ability to function in cracked cells (23Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It appears, then, that thermostability should only be used as an indicator of SNARE function in the case of mutating hydrophobic core residues involved in inter-SNARE interactions. When a surface residue of the core complex is mutated, the potential interaction of SNAREs with essential regulator(s) in a cellular context might be affected, which would not be reflected in the measured thermostability of purified SNARE complexes. In the case of the discontinuous SNAP-25 coil, the structural discontinuity probably causes a particularly dramatic effect on the heat-induced dissociation of the complex, which makes thermostability a less reliable indicator of SNARE function.The striking difference between the binding affinities of the wild-type SNAP-25 peptide in vitro and in PC12 cells (<5 µm versus ∼460 µm, an ∼100-fold or more difference) suggests that an energy-expensive reaction, likely membrane fusion, is coupled to the peptide binding. Because the peptide is only 26 residues long, it is unlikely that accessibility to a binding site accounts for the low rescuing efficiency, especially because the longer 65-mer S25C rescues more effectively at an equivalent concentration. It is likely that the free energy difference between peptide binding in vitro and in the cells is used by the SNAREs to lower the activation energy of membrane fusion. By lowering the activation energy barrier and stabilizing the transition state, SNAREs ensure that membranes fuse at a physiologically relevant rate.The 26-amino acid region of the SNAP-25 C terminus has been shown to be essential for Ca2+-dependent binding of synaptotagmin to SNARE complexes, perhaps mediating an element of the Ca2+ regulation of exocytosis (30Gerona R.R. Larsen E.C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6328-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 31Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis study may thus yield important information on the contribution of each residue to this regulation. In particular, the charged surface residues that affect exocytic function, Asp-186 and Arg-198, should be candidates for further investigation. In our system, however, the Ca2+ sensitivity of exocytosis was not abolished by any of the peptide mutants. We are currently studying possible subtle changes in Ca2+ sensing caused by these mutations.Some of our recent data obtained in this cracked cell system have put the mechanism of Ca2+ regulation of exocytosis in a different light. The results suggest that syntaxin might be regulated by Ca2+ to join a reversibly assembled VAMP·SNAP-25 complex to complete SNARE complex formation (23Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of this postulated syntaxin-bound Ca2+-sensitive fusion clamp is not known, but synaptotagmin (32Fernández-Chacón R. Königstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcı́a J. Matos M.F. Stevens C.F. Brose N. Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), tomosyn (33Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T.

Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) could all be potential candidates.The ability to manipulate the SNAP-25 C-terminal coil in cracked PC12 cells has allowed us to better understand the mechanism of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Our results suggest that SNARE proteins catalyze membrane fusion reaction by lowering the activation energy barrier. A future challenge in the field will lie in the regulation of SNARE complex formation, in particular the regulation by Ca2+. The ability to fuse two biological membranes is one of the essential features of every cell. Membrane fusion has been particularly well studied in the context of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones in neurons and neuroendocrine cells (1Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 2Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Investigation of the mechanism of membrane fusion showed that the solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein receptor (SNARE)1 protein family plays essential roles in this process. It is hypothesized that the v- or R-SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin, the plasma membrane t- or Q-SNAREs syntaxin, and SNAP-25 (3Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) assemble into a highly stable four-helical bundle, and in doing so bring the two membranes into close proximity and promote lipid mixing (4Hanson P.I.

Experimental support for this hypothesis includes structural data demonstrating a parallel organization of the SNARE coiled-coil bundle (4Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E.

Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). After membrane fusion is completed, cis-SNARE complexes (with their transmembrane domains in a single membrane) require α-SNAP and the ATPase NSF for disassembly, so that SNAREs can be re-used for the next round of fusion (16Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 17Xu T. Ashery U. Burgoyne R.D. Neher E.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). SNAREs are thought to drive or catalyze membrane fusion. Recent studies using purified SNARE proteins in synthetic liposomes have shed light on the potential mechanical driving mechanism of SNAREs. Increasing the length of the linker between the transmembrane domain and the conserved helical domain of SNAREs decreased the liposome fusion efficiency (19McNew J.A. Weber T. Engelman D.M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 415-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacement of transmembrane anchors of syntaxin and VAMP with short covalently attached lipids prevented lipid mixing without detriment to the liposome docking, suggesting that membranes do not simply fuse passively when held together (6McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus SNAREs appear to exert force on their membrane anchors by pulling on the linker and transmembrane domains, thus actively promoting lipid rearrangement and fusion. This force is almost certainly derived from the assembly of the parallel core complex bridging the two membranes. It was shown in the cracked PC12 cell system that mutating the conserved hydrophobic residues that are important for core complex formation resulted in decreased thermostability of core complexes and also dramatically impaired the ability to function in exocytosis (14Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Despite general agreement as to the major function of SNARE proteins, the sequence of events leading to complex assembly and bilayer fusion remain unclear. Some recent reports suggest that SNAREs interact prior to lipid mixing, perhaps as a partially assembled complex. Studies using synthetic liposomes and synaptosomes led to the same conclusion that SNAREs form complexes prior to the actual lipid and content mixing, although opposite conclusions were drawn as to whether NSF and α-SNAP disrupt such complexes (20Weber T. Parlati F. McNew J.A. Johnston R.J. Westermann B. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Lonart G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27703-27707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies using adrenal chromaffin cells showed that SNARE complexes exist in a dynamic equilibrium between a loose and a tight form before the arrival of the Ca2+ trigger, with the two forms leading to fusion with rate constants of 300 and 30 ms, respectively (15Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In crayfish neurons, an N-terminally zippered, C-terminally unzippered SNARE complex was suggested to exist prior to the fusion trigger (22Hua S.Y. Charlton M.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our recent results using the cracked PC12 cell system predict the existence of a reversibly assembled SNARE complex, with which the syntaxin coil is perhaps only loosely associated before the arrival of Ca2+ (23Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). If the full assembly of the SNARE complex is mechanically coupled to lipid fusion, a completely assembled four-helical bundle as in the crystal structure (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) should not exist before the fusion event itself and should only be the end product of the fusion event. Thus a clear distinction has to be made between a tight helical bundle complex and a partially assembled complex, as more than one kind of SNARE complex likely exists. A useful tool in studying exocytosis is a series of potent neurotoxins, botulinum and tetanus toxins, that proteolytically cleave SNARE (24Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) cleaves the SNAP-25 C-terminal helix (aa 142–206) between residues 180 and 181, removing a 26-amino acid peptide from the C terminus of SNAP-25 (25Binz T. Blasi J. Yamasaki S. Baumeister A. Link E. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Niemann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1617-1620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BoNT/E-cleaved SNAP-25 is incapable of forming an SDS-resistant SNARE complex (10Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells is abolished. We have shown previously that this inhibition can be reversed by adding a recombinant 65-mer SNAP-25 C-terminal coil (S25C) (14Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The added coil displaces the remaining half of the endogenous S25C coil (aa 142–180) and participates in SNARE complex formation as a complete new S25C coil. In the current study, we show that a peptide encompassing only aa 181–206 of SNAP-25, the 26-aa C terminus that is cleaved by BoNT/E, is also able to rescue exocytosis from BoNT/E-treated PC12 cells, albeit at higher concentrations than the full-length coil. This surprising finding prompted us to investigate the in vitro requirements for a functional SNARE complex, providing further insight into the mechanism of SNARE-mediated fusion. We also mutated each residue to alanine to study the functional contribution of each amino acid in this 26-aa region to SNAP-25 function. DISCUSSIONWe show that the SNAP-25 C-terminal 26-aa peptide can rescue BoNT/E-inhibited exocytosis. That a discontinuous S25C coil is able to function was initially surprising. Combined with the finding that the VAMP N-terminal peptide does not rescue BoNT/D-inhibited exocytosis, these results suggest that SNAP-25 likely promotes membrane fusion by contributing two cytoplasmic α-helices to stabilize the core complex, without directly doing work on the membranes. The lipid reorganization required for bilayer fusion is perhaps carried out by the two transmembrane SNAREs, syntaxin and VAMP, which can pull their membrane anchors upon core complex zippering (6McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Presumably the fact that two separate fragments of S25C with correct side chain arrangements can effectively rescue exocytosis means that no such force is transduced along the SNAP-25 C-terminal coil.The in vitro properties of the SNARE core complexes, most often SDS resistance and thermostability, have been used to predict their function inside cells. Whereas the normal core complex is known to be SDS-resistant and highly thermostable, we found that the core complex containing a discontinuous SNAP-25 coil is no longer SDS-resistant and much less stable. This is perhaps to be expected, given the structural disruption to the carbon backbone. We also found previously that if a core complex contains noncognate SNAREs or SNAP-25 mutations at non-“a/d” positions, the thermostability of the complex does not correlate with its ability to function in cracked cells (23Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It appears, then, that thermostability should only be used as an indicator of SNARE function in the case of mutating hydrophobic core residues involved in inter-SNARE interactions. When a surface residue of the core complex is mutated, the potential interaction of SNAREs with essential regulator(s) in a cellular context might be affected, which would not be reflected in the measured thermostability of purified SNARE complexes. In the case of the discontinuous SNAP-25 coil, the structural discontinuity probably causes a particularly dramatic effect on the heat-induced dissociation of the complex, which makes thermostability a less reliable indicator of SNARE function.The striking difference between the binding affinities of the wild-type SNAP-25 peptide in vitro and in PC12 cells (<5 µm versus ∼460 µm, an ∼100-fold or more difference) suggests that an energy-expensive reaction, likely membrane fusion, is coupled to the peptide binding. Because the peptide is only 26 residues long, it is unlikely that accessibility to a binding site accounts for the low rescuing efficiency, especially because the longer 65-mer S25C rescues more effectively at an equivalent concentration. It is likely that the free energy difference between peptide binding in vitro and in the cells is used by the SNAREs to lower the activation energy of membrane fusion. By lowering the activation energy barrier and stabilizing the transition state, SNAREs ensure that membranes fuse at a physiologically relevant rate.The 26-amino acid region of the SNAP-25 C terminus has been shown to be essential for Ca2+-dependent binding of synaptotagmin to SNARE complexes, perhaps mediating an element of the Ca2+ regulation of exocytosis (30Gerona R.R. Larsen E.C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6328-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 31Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis study may thus yield important information on the contribution of each residue to this regulation. In particular, the charged surface residues that affect exocytic function, Asp-186 and Arg-198, should be candidates for further investigation. In our system, however, the Ca2+ sensitivity of exocytosis was not abolished by any of the peptide mutants. We are currently studying possible subtle changes in Ca2+ sensing caused by these mutations.Some of our recent data obtained in this cracked cell system have put the mechanism of Ca2+ regulation of exocytosis in a different light. The results suggest that syntaxin might be regulated by Ca2+ to join a reversibly assembled VAMP·SNAP-25 complex to complete SNARE complex formation (23Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H.

Our results suggest that SNARE proteins catalyze membrane fusion reaction by lowering the activation energy barrier. A future challenge in the field will lie in the regulation of SNARE complex formation, in particular the regulation by Ca2+. We show that the SNAP-25 C-terminal 26-aa peptide can rescue BoNT/E-inhibited exocytosis. That a discontinuous S25C coil is able to function was initially surprising. Combined with the finding that the VAMP N-terminal peptide does not rescue BoNT/D-inhibited exocytosis, these results suggest that SNAP-25 likely promotes membrane fusion by contributing two cytoplasmic α-helices to stabilize the core complex, without directly doing work on the membranes. The lipid reorganization required for bilayer fusion is perhaps carried out by the two transmembrane SNAREs, syntaxin and VAMP, which can pull their membrane anchors upon core complex zippering (6McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Presumably the fact that two separate fragments of S25C with correct side chain arrangements can effectively rescue exocytosis means that no such force is transduced along the SNAP-25 C-terminal coil. The in vitro properties of the SNARE core complexes, most often SDS resistance and thermostability, have been used to predict their function inside cells. Whereas the normal core complex is known to be SDS-resistant and highly thermostable, we found that the core complex containing a discontinuous SNAP-25 coil is no longer SDS-resistant and much less stable. This is perhaps to be expected, given the structural disruption to the carbon backbone. We also found previously that if a core complex contains noncognate SNAREs or SNAP-25 mutations at non-“a/d” positions, the thermostability of the complex does not correlate with its ability to function in cracked cells (23Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It appears, then, that thermostability should only be used as an indicator of SNARE function in the case of mutating hydrophobic core residues involved in inter-SNARE interactions. When a surface residue of the core complex is mutated, the potential interaction of SNAREs with essential regulator(s) in a cellular context might be affected, which would not be reflected in the measured thermostability of purified SNARE complexes. In the case of the discontinuous SNAP-25 coil, the structural discontinuity probably causes a particularly dramatic effect on the heat-induced dissociation of the complex, which makes thermostability a less reliable indicator of SNARE function. The striking difference between the binding affinities of the wild-type SNAP-25 peptide in vitro and in PC12 cells (<5 µm versus ∼460 µm, an ∼100-fold or more difference) suggests that an energy-expensive reaction, likely membrane fusion, is coupled to the peptide binding. Because the peptide is only 26 residues long, it is unlikely that accessibility to a binding site accounts for the low rescuing efficiency, especially because the longer 65-mer S25C rescues more effectively at an equivalent concentration. It is likely that the free energy difference between peptide binding in vitro and in the cells is used by the SNAREs to lower the activation energy of membrane fusion. By lowering the activation energy barrier and stabilizing the transition state, SNAREs ensure that membranes fuse at a physiologically relevant rate. The 26-amino acid region of the SNAP-25 C terminus has been shown to be essential for Ca2+-dependent binding of synaptotagmin to SNARE complexes, perhaps mediating an element of the Ca2+ regulation of exocytosis (30Gerona R.R.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis study may thus yield important information on the contribution of each residue to this regulation. In particular, the charged surface residues that affect exocytic function, Asp-186 and Arg-198, should be candidates for further investigation.

We previously showed that the cytoplasmic domains of several other Syt isoforms also show Ca2+-dependent oligomerization activity (Fukuda, M., and Mikoshiba, K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.275, 28180–28185), but little is known about the involvement of their C2 domains in Ca2+-dependent oligomerization. In this study, we analyzed the Ca2+-dependent oligomerization properties of the first (C2A) and the second C2 (C2B) domains of Syt VII. Unlike Syt I, both C2 domains of Syt VII contribute to Ca2+-dependent homo- and hetero-oligomerization with other isoforms. For instance, the Syt VII C2A domain Ca2+-dependently binds itself and the C2A domain of Syt VI but not its C2B domain, whereas the Syt VII C2B domain Ca2+-dependently binds itself and the C2B domain of Syt II but not its C2A domain. In addition, we showed by gel filtration that a single Syt VII C2 domain is sufficient to form a Ca2+-dependent multimer of very high molecular weight. Because of this “two handed” structure, the Syt VII cytoplasmic domain has been found to show the strongest Ca2+-dependent multimerization activity in the Syt family. We also identified Asn-328 in the C2B domain as a crucial residue for the efficient Ca2+-dependent switch for multimerization by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results suggest that Syt VII is a specific isoform that can cluster different Syt isoforms with two hands in response to Ca2+.

Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Synaptic vesicle proteins are then recycled from the plasma membrane by endocytosis to prepare for the next round of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The synaptic vesicle cycle is now known to consist of at least four distinct steps: (i) docking of synaptic vesicles to active zones (docking step), (ii) an ATP-dependent priming step, (iii) actual fusion of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane (fusion step), and (iv) recycling of synaptic vesicles by endocytosis (reviewed in Refs. 3Jahn R.

Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). A variety of proteins involved in the regulation of each step of the synaptic vesicle cycle have already been identified (3Jahn R.

One of them, synaptotagmin I (Syt I),1 an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, is very interesting, because it regulates three distinct steps in the synaptic vesicle cycle (i.e.docking, fusion, and recycling). Synaptotagmins constitute a large family, both in vertebrates and invertebrates (5Lloyd T.E. Verstreken P. Ostrin E.J. Phillippi A. Lichtarge O. Bellen H.J.

Indeed, mutation (Tyr-312 to Asn substitution) in the C2B domain of mouse Syt II, which corresponds to the Drosophila AD3 mutation, impairs Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization activity, and this activity is inhibited by inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, a powerful blocker of neurotransmitter release, in vitro (29Fukuda M. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Llinás R. Sugimori M. Lang E.J. Morita M. Fukuda M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our previous study showed that Syt VII, which is involved in Ca2+-dependent lysosomal exocytosis in fibroblasts (31Martinez I. Chakrabarti S. Hellevik T. Morehead J. Fowler K. Andrews N.W. J.

(Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Syt VII Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization via the cytoplasmic domain occurs without tethering at the amino-terminal domain, whereas the Syt II Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization via the C2B domain occurs only when the two molecules are preassembled at the amino-terminal domain (26Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of Syt I (or II) has been shown to be mediated by the C2B domain (22Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

In this study, we sought to determine the structural basis of Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII. Unlike Syt I, both the C2A and C2B domains of Syt VII function as a Ca2+-dependent oligomerization site (i.e. Syt VII has “two hands”), and this explains its robust Ca2+-dependent oligomerization activity. We also showed that the single C2 domain is sufficient for Ca2+-dependent multimerization and identified Asn-328 in the C2B domain as a crucial residue for Ca2+-dependent multimerization by site-directed mutagenesis.

Cells expressing T7-Syt VII-C2A (or -Syt VII-C2B) proteins were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µm leupeptin, and 10 µmpepstatin A (buffer 1) and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, as described previously (33Fukuda M.

After incubation with 2 mm EGTA or 1 mm Ca2+ (final concentration) for 15 min, the extracts were applied to a Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration column (1 × 120 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) that had been equilibrated with buffer 1 containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA (or 1 mm CaCl2). Fractions were collected in 750 µl, and each fraction was analyzed by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody, as described previously (33Fukuda M.

The apparent molecular weight of Syt VII-C2A (or -C2B) in the presence and absence of 1 mm Ca2+ was estimated by loading gel filtration molecular weight markers (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) on the Sepharose CL-6B column. Cotransfection of pEF-T7-Syts and pEF-FLAG-Syts into COS-7 cells was carried out (5 × 105 cells the day before transfection/10-cm dish) by the DEAE-dextran method, as described previously (33Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).

T7-Syts were immunoprecipitated by anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+or 2 mm EGTA, as described previously (26Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analyses were also performed, as described previously (33Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Immunoreactive bands on x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Kodak) were captured by Gel Print 2000i/VGA (Bio Image) and analyzed with Basic Quantifier Software (version 1.0) (Bio Image). Multiple sequence alignment of the mouse synaptotagmin family was performed by using the ClustalW program, as described previously (38Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In our previous study we showed that the Syt VII cytoplasmic domain alone is sufficient for Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization activity (26Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To identify the domain responsible for the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of Syt VII, we produced various Syt VII deletion mutants and tagged them with T7 (see Fig. 1 A). Each T7-tagged mutant was coexpressed with the FLAG-Syt VII cytoplasmic domain (Syt VII-cyto) in COS-7 cells, and the associations between the T7- and FLAG-tag proteins were evaluated by immunoprecipitation, as described previously (33Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, T7-Syt proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose in the presence and absence of 500 µm Ca2+. The co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Syt-cyto proteins were first detected by anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1 B, upper panel), and the same blot was then stripped and reprobed with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibodies (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). Surprisingly, with the exception of T7-Syt VII-cytoΔC2AB (spacer domain alone), all the deletion mutants interacted with FLAG-Syt VII-cyto only in the presence of Ca2+, indicating that each of the C2 domains functions as an acceptor for the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization. By contrast, Syt I Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization has been shown to be mediated by the C2B domain alone and not by the C2A domain (22Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Desai R.C. Vyas B. Earles C.A. Littleton J.T. Kowalchyck J.A. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To investigate whether a single C2 domain alone is sufficient for the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization capacity of Syt VII, Ca2+-dependent association between T7- and FLAG-Syt VII-C2A (or C2B) was investigated as described above. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both C2 domains showed Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization activity, although some fractions (about 40%) of the C2A domain self-oligomerized even in the absence of Ca2+. Because the entire cytoplasmic domain of Syt VII did not show Ca2+-independent self-oligomerization activity (Fig. 1 B and Ref. 26Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-independent self-oligomerization of the Syt VII C2A domain observed may be an artifact, probably induced by removing the C2A domain from the whole protein. By contrast, no hetero-oligomerization activity was detected between the C2A and C2B domains (Fig. 2 A). In our previous study, we showed that the Syt VII cytoplasmic domain can interact with various Syt isoforms in a Ca2+-dependent manner (26Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Syt VII preferentially interacts with Syts V, VI, and X, weakly with Syts I, II, and IX, but not essentially with Syts III, IV, VIII, and XI (26Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,27Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine which C2 domains of Syt VII are involved in hetero-oligomerization with other Syt isoforms, FLAG-Syt VII-C2A (or -C2B) was coexpressed with T7-Syts II, IV, VI, and VIII cytoplasmic domains in COS-7 cells, and their associations were evaluated as described above. Surprisingly, Syt II-cyto weakly interacted with both C2 domains of Syt VII in the presence of Ca2+, whereas Syt-VI-cyto interacted only with the Syt VII C2A domain in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, Syt IV-cyto and Syt VIII-cyto did not interact with either C2 domain of Syt VII, consistent with the findings in a previous report (27Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To further specify the domains of Syt II (or Syt VI) that act as an acceptor for Ca2+-dependent hetero-oligomerization with Syt VII, each C2 domain of Syt II (or Syt VI) with a T7-tag was similarly coexpressed with FLAG-Syt VII-cyto in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig.2 C, the Syt II C2B and Syt VI C2A domains were found to be essential for Ca2+-dependent hetero-oligomerization with Syt VII. Thus, the contribution of the C2 domains to Syt Ca2+-dependent oligomerization differs among isoforms. Because the cytoplasmic domain of Syt VII showed Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization activity with an EC50 value of about 150 µmCa2+, we investigated the Ca2+ dependence of the self-oligomerization activity of each of the C2 domains of Syt VII (Fig. 3 A). The EC50 values for self-oligomerization by the Syt VII C2A and C2B domains were ∼150 µm Ca2+ and 250 µm Ca2+, respectively (Fig. 3 B; Syt VII-C2A, closed squares; Syt VII-C2B, open squares). Thus, the EC50 values for self-oligomerization with the isolated C2 domains and the full cytoplasmic domain are essentially the same. In the next set of experiments we sought to identify the amino acid residues responsible for the robust Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of Syt VII. First, we made sequence comparisons among mouse Syts I-XI C2 domains in a search for specific amino acid residues found only in Syt VII and not in other Syt isoforms. We found one Asn residue that was only present in the C2 domains of Syt VII (Asn-195 in the C2A domain and Asn-328 in the C2B domain of Syt VII), with the corresponding positions of Syts I–VI and VIII–XI being occupied by Thr (Fig.4 A, asterisk). These Asn residues of Syt VII are located between the β4 and β5 strands of the eight-stranded β-sandwich structure of the C2 domain and are in close proximity to the C2B effector domain responsible for inositol polyphosphate, AP-2 binding, and self-oligomerization of Syt I (two Lys residues in Fig. 4 A,number signs (##)) (24Chapman E.R.

Commun. 1997; 240: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of these Asn residues in the self-oligomerization of Syt VII, we performed site-directed mutagenesis, and obtained Syt VII-C2A(N195T) and -C2B(N328T) mutants. As expected, the C2B(N328T) mutant had completely lost Ca2+-dependent oligomerization activity (Fig. 4 B, right panel), although some fractions of C2B(N328T) mutant proteins showed Ca2+-independent oligomerization activity with the wild-type C2B domain. By contrast, the N198T mutation had no effect on Ca2+-dependent oligomerization by the C2A domain (Fig. 4 B, left panel). Similar experiments were performed by using the full cytoplasmic domain carrying the N195T or N328T mutation (Fig. 4 C), and interestingly, the N328T mutation completely abolished the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization activity (i.e. Ca2+-independent self-oligomerization), even when the C2A domain was intact. To further investigate the importance of Asn-328 of the C2B domain in Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization, we mutated this residue to other amino acids with different side-chain structures (N328A, N328L, N328D, N328K, N328P). As shown in Fig. 4 D, except for the N328P mutant, self-oligomerization of these mutants was also stimulated by Ca2+ (to an extent similar to that of the wild-type protein), but the Ca2+-independent self-oligomerization activity was significantly increased. By contrast, the N328P mutant resulted in the loss of Ca2+-dependent oligomerization, the same as the N328T mutation. These results indicate that Asn-328 in the C2B domain is associated with efficient Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization. Using a dominant negative approach, Chapman and co-workers (28Desai R.C. Vyas B. Earles C.A. Littleton J.T. Kowalchyck J.A. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) recently showed that Ca2+-dependent Syt I oligomerization is involved in fusion of secretory vesicles in PC12 cells and proposed that Ca2+-dependent Syt clustering may regulate opening and/or expansion of a “fusion pore.” Nevertheless, it remains unknown how many Syt molecules cluster in response to Ca2+, even though such information is quite important in evaluating whether Syt molecules can regulate the fusion pore. To address this, we used gel filtration to estimate the molecular weight of each Syt VII C2 domain in the presence and absence of 1 mm Ca2+ (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In the absence of Ca2+, the Syt VII-C2B proteins were eluted as a single peak (Fig.5, top panel, fractions 75–80), and their apparent molecular mass was estimated to be ∼10 kDa. Because the calculated molecular weight of T7-Syt VII-C2B is 17,451 and Syt VII-C2B did not form oligomers in the immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2 A), we concluded that Syt VII-C2B is present as a monomer in the absence of Ca2+(Fig. 5, top panel). By contrast, in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, Syt VII-C2B proteins were eluted as a single peak with a very high molecular weight (Fig. 5, second panel, fractions 31–36) that was identical to the elution profile of blue dextran (M r 2,000,000), an indicator of the void volume of the column (Fig. 5, bottom). Thus, we were unable to determine the exact number of the C2B domain clustered by Ca2+. The molecular weight shift induced by Ca2+ probably reflects direct clustering of the Syt VII C2B domain itself, and it is most unlikely to be mediated by certain adapter proteins (i.e.Ca2+-dependent binding partner of Syts, such as syntaxin I) (40Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), because after Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining of the gel we were unable to observe any bands other than Syt molecules and the anti-T7-tag antibody used for immunoprecipitation, and syntaxin I is not expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). We therefore concluded that the Syt VII-C2B domain forms a multimer in the presence of Ca2+. We also evaluated the apparent molecular weight of Syt VII-C2B(N328T) mutant protein by using the same gel filtration column. Interestingly, Syt VII-C2B(N328T) proteins form multimers irrespective of the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5,fifth and sixth panels). Similar results were obtained with the Syt VII-C2A domain (Fig. 5,third and fourth panels), although in the absence of Ca2+ the Syt VII-C2A domain eluted as a broad peak. Because the calculated molecular weight of T7-Syt VII-C2A is 16,667 and Syt VII-C2A formed Ca2+-independent oligomers in the immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2 A), this peak probably consists of the Syt VII-C2A dimer and monomer. In the present study we analyzed the Ca2+-dependent multimerization properties of the C2 domains of Syt VII to determine why Syt VII is the only member of the Syt family to exhibit robust Ca2+-dependent oligomerization activity (26Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), why Syt VII is able to interact with various Syt molecules (27Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and how many Syt VII molecules cluster in response to Ca2+. The results presented in this paper indicate that both C2 domains of Syt VII contribute to Ca2+-dependent homo- and/or hetero-multimerization, with slightly different affinities for Ca2+ (EC50 value for C2A domain self-multimerization of about 150 µm, and for the C2B domain self-multimerization, of about 250 µm). This finding is in considerable contrast to the results obtained for Syt I or II, because only the C2B domain of Syts I and II is involved in Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization (22Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Damer C.K. Creutz C.E. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32966-32972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The Syt VII C2A domain efficiently interacts with itself and the Syt VI C2A domain, and weakly with the C2B domain of Syt II, but cannot interact with its C2B domain. Similarly, the Syt VII C2B domain interacts with itself and weakly with the C2B domain of Syt II, but not with its C2A domain. The Ca2+-dependent homo- and hetero-oligomerization properties of Syt VII are summarized in Fig.2 D. Because of this two handed structure of Syt VII, it can oligomerize more efficiently than other Syt isoforms and can interact with various Syt isoforms without being tethered at the amino-terminal domain (26Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the Syt family and site-directed mutagenesis enabled us to identify Asn-328 in the C2B domain as a crucial residue for Ca2+-dependent self-multimerization by Syt VII. This Asn residue is found to be conserved in human, rat, and mouse Syt VII, but the corresponding position in other mouse Syt isoforms and Syts from other species is occupied by Thr (data not shown). Thus, the strong Ca2+-dependent multimerization properties are probably retained, at least in mammals. Recent crystallographic analysis of C2 domains of Syt I, phospholipase Cδ1 (PLCδ1), and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) showed the C2 domains to be composed of a common eight-stranded anti-parallel β-sandwich consisting of four-stranded β-sheets, although their structures have been classified into two groups based on their topology (e.g. synaptotagmin I C2A domain with type I topology and PLCδ1 C2 domain with type II topology) (41Sutton R.B.

Three flexible loops (named loops 1–3) protrude from the tip of the β-sandwich structure, and two of them (loops 1 and 3) are involved in Ca2+ binding in the Syt I-C2A domain, all three of which are loops in the PLCδ1- and cPLA2-C2A domains (41Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 42Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R.

Interestingly, Asn-677 (PLCδ1) and Asn-65 (cPLA2) in loop 2 bind Ca2+, and these residues correspond closely to the Syt VII Asn-328 residue located in loop 2, which is formed by β-4 and β-5 strands (Fig. 4 A), suggesting a role of Asn-328 in direct Ca2+ binding or indirect stabilization of Ca2+binding to loops 1 and 3. Because the Ca2+-binding sites of the two C2 domains of Syt III face each other (41Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and some fractions of the isolated C2A domain appear to form dimers in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5), it is tempting to speculate that the Asn-328 residue of Syt VII is also involved in Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of the C2A domain. Mutation of Asn-328 to Pro or Thr resulted in the loss of Ca2+-dependent multimerization, and these mutants showed Ca2+-independent multimerization (Figs.4 C, 4 D, and 5), whereas mutation of Asn-328 to Ala, Leu, Asp, or Lys had no significant effect on Ca2+-dependent self-multimerization but Ca2+-independent self-oligomerization activity was significantly increased (Fig. 4 D). If the Asn-328 residue serves as an interface for multimerization (i.e. a major site for multimerization), mutation of Asn-328 to other amino acids with different side-chain structures should result in loss of self-oligomerization activity. However, we could not obtain a mutant completely lacking self-multimerization activity by mutation of Asn-328, suggesting that the Asn-328 residue is crucial for controlling the Ca2+ dependence of self-multimerization rather than for multimerization itself. Indeed, the Syt I-C2B effector domain responsible for Ca2+-dependent oligomerization is located in the middle of the β-4 strand (side of the β-sandwich structure that is distinct from the putative Ca2+-binding site) (24Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32966-32972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Fukuda M. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that Ca2+ binding to the apex of the β-sandwich structure (loops 1–3) may change electrostatic charges or induce structural changes, which would allow the putative C2B effector domain of Syt VII (middle of the β-4 strand located at the side of the β-sandwich structure) to participate in self-multimerization. Further three-dimensional studies are required to elucidate how Asn-328 of Syt VII regulates Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of C2 domains. In summary, we showed that both the C2A and C2B domains of Syt VII contribute to Ca2+-dependent multimerization. Because of this two handed structure, Syt VII can cluster heterogeneous Syt isoforms (Syts I, II, V, VI, VII, IX, and X) in response to Ca2+, and this Ca2+-dependent Syt multimer may regulate vesicular exocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2027867616,"Incubation of murine tumor necrosis factor (mTNF) at subnanomolar concentrations results in partial dissociation of the trimers, coinciding with a decrease in bioactivity. Using size-exclusion chromatography, we observed that the conversion of labeled mTNF to monomers is not only prevented by coincubation with an excess of unlabeled mTNF but also with unlabeled human TNF (hTNF). Moreover, after coincubation of mTNF and hTNF four different TNF complexes were revealed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, viz. homotrimeric mTNF and hTNF, as well as two complexes with an intermediate migration pattern. Analytical gel filtration in combination with native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot immunodetection indicated that these new complexes consisted of heterotrimeric TNF molecules. We conclude that an exchange of monomers takes place during coincubation of two different species of TNF, which results in homotrimeric and heterotrimeric TNF. To assess receptor interaction in vitro, TNF heterotrimeric molecules were used as obtained after incubation of mTNF with labeled hTNF (which only binds to mTNF receptor I) or with labeled mutein mTNF75 (specific for mTNF receptor II). These heterotrimers were retained by both mTNF receptors, which means that the mTNF subunits incorporated in heterotrimeric complexes still can bind to both types of TNF receptor. In addition, the gradual decrease in mTNF bioactivity during preincubation at subnanomolar concentrations was prevented by the presence of mutein mTNF75, which is inactive in an L929 cytotoxicity assay, indicating that heterotrimerization can influence the overall bioactivity. Incubation of murine tumor necrosis factor (mTNF) at subnanomolar concentrations results in partial dissociation of the trimers, coinciding with a decrease in bioactivity. Using size-exclusion chromatography, we observed that the conversion of labeled mTNF to monomers is not only prevented by coincubation with an excess of unlabeled mTNF but also with unlabeled human TNF (hTNF). Moreover, after coincubation of mTNF and hTNF four different TNF complexes were revealed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, viz. homotrimeric mTNF and hTNF, as well as two complexes with an intermediate migration pattern.

TNF exists both as a transmembrane and as a circulating, homotrimeric complex that signals via interaction with two types of receptors,viz. the p55 TNF receptor (TNF-RI; CD120a) and the p75 TNF receptor (TNF-RII; CD120b). One TNF trimer can bind three TNF-R molecules, and this receptor clustering initiates the intracellular signaling cascade (4Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Beyaert R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W.

Human lymphotoxin (hLT)-α is another member of the TNF superfamily that also forms a homotrimeric complex and signals through both TNF-Rs. Its interaction with the solubilized, extracellular part of hTNF-RI has been studied by x-ray diffraction (6Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H.

The results showed in detail how the soluble receptors were bound in the three grooves, formed between neighboring LT-α subunits. In agreement with these data, receptor-specific muteins of hTNF were obtained by mutating amino acids bordering these grooves (7Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

Treatment with particular reagents promotes the dissociation of TNF, which can be reversed by increasing the TNF concentration or by removing the chemical agent (11Aderka D. Engelmann H. Maor Y.

Murine TNF (mTNF) is 79% identical in amino acid sequence to hTNF. The three-dimensional structure of mTNF and hTNF is similar, diverging mainly in regions that are flexible and/or involved in crystal packing (15Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Baeyens K.J. De Bondt H.L. Raeymaekers A. Fiers W. De Ranter C.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNF chimeric proteins, constructed by exchanging homologous regions between hTNF and mTNF DNA, are able to associate in trimeric, bioactive molecules (17Tavernier J. Marmenout A. Bauden R. Hauquier G. Van Ostade X. Fiers W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As we observed, by size-exclusion chromatography, that mTNF and hTNF prevent the conversion of labeled mTNF to monomers, we hypothesized that TNF subunits can be exchanged during coincubation of mTNF and hTNF, resulting in both heterotrimeric and homotrimeric TNF molecules. Experiments with monoclonal antibodies specific for mTNF and hTNF confirmed that such heterotrimeric TNF molecules are formed during coincubation. To study the effect of subunit exchange on the interaction with mTNF-Rs, we used heterotrimers containing, in addition to mTNF subunits, hTNF that interacts only with mTNF-RI, and mutein mTNF75 that interacts specifically with mTNF-RII. Purified Escherichia coli-derived mTNF, hTNF, and hLT-α were produced in our laboratory; they had a specific biological activity of 2.1 × 108, 8.4 × 107, and 4.0 × 107 units/mg, respectively, in an L929 cytotoxicity assay. Mutein mTNF75 was created by site-specific mutagenesis of Arg-32 → Tyr and Ala-145 → Arg. This mutein binds only to mTNF-RII in anin vitro receptor binding assay. 1F3F3, a monoclonal antibody to mTNF (18Lucas R. Heirwegh K. Neirynck A. Remels L. Van Heuverswyn H. De Baetselier P.

De Baetselier (Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium). 61E71, a monoclonal antibody to hTNF (19Stevens H.P. van der Kwast T.H. van der Meide P.H. Vuzevski V.D. Buurman W.A. Jonker M.

Immunol. 1989; 142: 3884-3893PubMed Google Scholar), and polyclonal rabbit antiserum against mTNF and hTNF were kindly provided by Dr. W. A. Buurman (University of Limburg, Limburg, The Netherlands). mTNF and hTNF were radiolabeled using an Iodogen iodination agent (Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, IL). Labeled proteins were separated from unincorporated radioactivity on a G-25 column (PD10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and had a specific radioactivity of 10–50 µCi/µg. Gel filtration of radiolabeled TNF was performed on a Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated and eluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.02% NaN3 (PBS/BSA) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected and tested for radioactivity in a γ-counter. All gel filtration chromatographies were performed at 4 °C. Gel filtration of unlabeled TNF was performed on a Superdex-75 fast protein liquid chromatography column (1-cm internal diameter × 30 cm;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluted protein was detected by UV absorbance at 280 nm and collected in 1-min fractions. This procedure was performed according to the instructions of Bio-Rad. Proteins were dissolved in sample buffer (75 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and applied to a separating 10% polyacrylamide gel (375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8). Running buffer consisted of Tris-glycine (24.8 mm, 191.8 mm, pH 8.3). Proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or by immunodetection with anti-TNF antibodies after Western blotting on nitrocellulose. Proteins in native polyacrylamide gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose in a semi-dry blotting apparatus with a Tris-glycine buffer (48 mm, 39 mm) containing SDS (0.0375%) and methanol (20%). Blots were saturated in PBS containing 4% milk powder and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-mTNF or anti-hTNF serum. Subsequently the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled conjugate (Pierce). Finally, blots were incubated with Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent plus (DuPont); light emission was detected with autoradiography films. 96-Well plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibody (2.5 µg/ml; 100 µl/well) in PBS. After coating, wells were saturated for 3 h at 26 °C with 150 µl/well of PBS containing 2% BSA. After washing with PBS, plates were incubated with samples containing radiolabeled TNF and diluted in PBS/BSA (100 µl/well) for 90 min at 26 °C. After washing with PBS, wells were separated and individually counted in a γ-counter. Soluble (extracellular) fragments of mTNF-RI (smTNF-RI) or smTNF-RII were produced with the baculovirus expression system in Sf9 insect cells and partially purified. Microtiter plates were coated with smTNF-RI (0.66 µg/ml) or smTNF-RII (1 µg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Blocking was achieved with PBS/2% BSA. The microtiter plates were incubated with 400 pm (20 ng/ml) 125I-labeled TNF in the presence of different concentrations of unlabeled TNF. After a 4-h incubation at 26 °C, the wells were washed with PBS/0.02% BSA, and bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. L929 murine fibrosarcoma cells (Rega Institute, Leuven, Belgium) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 µg/ml), andl-glutamine (2 mm) (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal calf serum). Cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at 30,000 cells/well. The next day, a serial dilution of TNF in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal calf serum with or without mutein mTNF75 was added to the cells in the presence of actinomycin D (1 µg/ml). After an 18-h incubation, the amount of surviving cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric method (21Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46513) Google Scholar). The stability of mTNF after incubation at subnanomolar concentrations was studied by size-exclusion chomatography on Sephacryl S100, which allows discrimination between trimeric and monomeric forms of TNF. Without prior incubation, iodinated mTNF (400 pm) eluted in a single peak with a molecular mass of 49 kDa, whereas after overnight preincubation at 26 °C mTNF eluted in two peaks with a molecular mass of 49 and 11 kDa, corresponding to mTNF trimers and monomers, respectively (Fig.1 A). When unlabeled mTNF (4 nm) had been added during preincubation, almost all labeled mTNF remained in the trimer peak. When labeled mTNF (400 pm) was preincubated for 16 h in the presence of hTNF (4 nm), all label remained in the trimer peak, indicating also that hTNF can keep labeled mTNF subunits in a trimeric form (Fig.1 B). Similarly, the appearance of labeled hTNF monomers following preincubation at low concentrations was prevented by the addition of a higher concentration of hTNF or mTNF (data not shown). Coincubation with hLT-α (up to 10 nm), however, did not affect the elution profile of labeled mTNF or labeled hTNF (Fig.1 B). This argues against an aspecific effect because of the presence of higher levels of protein. Gel filtration experiments showed that mTNF and hTNF specifically influence each other's quaternary structure during prolonged coincubation; they do not, however, directly prove the formation of heterotrimeric complexes. As mTNF and hTNF have a nearly identical molecular mass, they cannot be discriminated by SDS-PAGE. However, mTNF migrates faster than hTNF during native PAGE because of differences in overall charge distribution (Fig. 2 A). After coincubation of mTNF and hTNF (both at 3 µg/10 µl) for 16 h at 4 °C, two additional bands with a migration pattern intermediate between that of homogeneous mTNF and hTNF are revealed by native PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 2). These additional bands already become apparent after coincubation of only 4 h. Western blot immunodetection of these native gels showed that the two additional bands are recognized efficiently both by anti-hTNF and anti-mTNF antibodies (Fig. 3,A and B).Figure 3Characterization of TNF complexes by native PAGE followed by Western blot immunodetection. TNF samples (0.3 µg/10 µl) were incubated at 4 °C and subjected to native 10% PAGE. Proteins were detected by Western blot immunodetection with anti-hTNF antibodies (A) and with anti-mTNF antibodies (B). Lane 1, hTNF (16 h); lane 2, hTNF + mTNF (16 h); lane 3, hTNF + mTNF (4 h); lane 4, mTNF (16 h). TNF complexes are as follows: h, homotrimeric hTNF; hm and mh, heteromeric TNF; m, homotrimeric mTNF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the conformation of the complexes formed during coincubation of mTNF and hTNF (both 30 µg), we applied the mixture to a Superdex 75 fast protein liquid chromatography column. Calibration of this column revealed that mTNF (trimers) and hTNF (trimers) eluted after 20.7 and 21.2 min, corresponding with an apparent molecular mass of 49 and 46 kDa, respectively (Fig.4 B). After coincubation, all TNF complexes eluted in a single peak between 20 and 23 min (Fig.4 A). The peak fractions were analyzed by native PAGE, followed by Western blot immunodetection with anti-hTNF (Fig.4 C). Homotrimeric hTNF (the band migrating the slowest after native PAGE) was detected in the fractions 21–23, whereas complexes migrating faster were detected in the fractions 20–23. This indicates that homotrimeric TNF molecules elute together with heterotrimeric TNF molecules containing both mTNF and hTNF subunits after gel filtration. As the TNF complexes revealed by native PAGE were treated with SDS and methanol to enhance electroblotting before incubation with anti-TNF antibodies, we tested whether undenatured heterotrimeric TNF molecules still interact with monoclonal antibodies specific for mTNF or hTNF. Labeled mTNF (200 pm) does not bind to wells coated with 61E71, an hTNF-specific monoclonal antibody. However, after prior overnight coincubation with hTNF (1 nm) almost 14% of labeled mTNF was retained on 61E71-coated wells (TableI). Likewise, almost 18% of labeled hTNF (200 pm) was retained on wells coated with 1F3F3, an mTNF-specific monoclonal antibody, after preincubation with mTNF (1 nm). Preincubation with mTNF did not lead to binding of labeled hTNF on wells coated with TN3, another mTNF-specific monoclonal antibody (Table I).Table IFormation of heterotrimeric TNF molecules as revealed by RIACoating antibodyLabeled mTNF bound (% of total)Labeled hTNF bound (% of total)Labeled mTNF preincubated in PBS/BSAWith hTNFLabeled hTNF preincubated in PBS/BSAWith mTNFTN346.5 ± 0.521.1 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.11F3F341.1 ± 1.830.5 ± 0.40.3 ± 0.117.9 ± 0.761E710.3 ± 0.113.8 ± 2.631.8 ± 0.132.3 ± 0.5125I-TNF (200 pm) was incubated for 24 h at 26 °C with or without unlabeled TNF (1 nm).

After 90 min at 26 °C, the wells were washed with PBS/BSA, and the remaining label in the individual wells was counted in a γ-counter.

Subsequently, the samples were diluted 1:5 in PBS/BSA and applied to wells coated with anti-mTNF monoclonal antibodies (TN3 and 1F3F3) and anti-hTNF antibody (61E71). After 90 min at 26 °C, the wells were washed with PBS/BSA, and the remaining label in the individual wells was counted in a γ-counter. Results (bound label/applied label × 100) are means ± S.D. of three experiments. The binding on 1F3F3-coated wells of labeled heterotrimers, formed during coincubation of labeled hTNF and at increasing concentrations of unlabeled mTNF, shows a bell-shaped curve (Fig.5). Maximal binding was obtained when labeled hTNF was incubated with 600 to 1600 pm unlabeled mTNF. At higher mTNF concentrations, there is increased competition for binding on the antibody between labeled heterotrimeric molecules and unlabeled homotrimeric mTNF. Formation of heterotrimeric TNF at 26 or 37 °C reached a maximum after 24 h but was already clearly detectable after 2 h. At 4 °C the formation of heterotrimeric TNF molecules was slower but reached an almost comparable level after prolonged coincubation (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed, using an 1F3F3-RIA, that natural mTNF derived from a murine macrophage cell line was as efficient as recombinant mTNF to form heterotrimeric complexes with labeled hTNF (data not shown). To study the specificity of different monoclonal antibodies for monomeric and/or trimeric TNF forms, labeled TNF (1.6 nm) was dissociated by treatment with 3 m guanidinium chloride or 0.1% Triton X-100 (19Stevens H.P. van der Kwast T.H. van der Meide P.H. Vuzevski V.D. Buurman W.A. Jonker M. Transplantation. 1990; 50: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Sheehan K.C. Ruddle N.H. Schreiber R.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3884-3893PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently subjected to gel filtration. The TNF-containing fractions were then isolated and used in RIA with different monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig.6, 1F3F3 trapped the label present in the peak with homotrimeric mTNF (maximum around fraction 40) more efficiently than that in the peak with monomeric mTNF (maximum around fraction 60). TN3, on the other hand, trapped the label in the peak with monomeric TNF better than that in the trimeric peak. It is also obvious that TN3 cannot bind heterotrimeric TNF (Table I). 61E71 bound trimeric hTNF more efficiently than monomeric hTNF (data not shown). As the interaction between TNF and TNF-Rs determines its biological function, we studied the binding of heterotrimeric TNF with both mTNF-Rs. As expected, labeled hTNF only interacted with smTNF-RI in an in vitro receptor binding assay; this binding could be blocked by competition with unlabeled hTNF or mTNF. However, after preincubation with mTNF, a significant amount of labeled hTNF was retained also on smTNF-RII-coated wells (Fig. 7). Similar observations were made with mTNF75, a mutein of mTNF, which binds strongly to smTNF-RII but not to smTNF-RI (Fig.8). Labeled mTNF75 was retained on smTNF-RII-coated wells, and this binding was inhibitable by unlabeled mTNF, whereas the mutein did not bind to smTNF-RI-coated wells. However, after prior incubation of labeled mutein with unlabeled mTNF, allowing the formation of heterotrimers, part of the label was retained on wells coated with smTNF-RI.Figure 8Binding of labeled mTNF75 mutein to smTNF-Rs. 125I-mTNF75 (400 pm) was incubated with mTNF for 24 h and subsequently applied to wells coated with smTNF-RI (white circles) or smTNF-RII (black triangles). Bound label was measured in a γ -counter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dissociation of mTNF at subnanomolar concentrations is accompanied by a strong decrease in cytotoxicity to L929 cells (Table II). This decrease in mTNF activity was partially prevented by mTNF75, a mutein that is inactive in this assay (Table II). The mTNF75 mutein did not affect the biological activity of mTNF when no preincubation took place. These experiments demonstrate that the apparent receptor specificity of a TNF species can be lost because of incorporation of heterologous TNF subunits.Table IIEffect of mTNF75 mutein on the biological activity of mTNFL929 cytotoxicity assaymTNFmTNF75PreincubationBiological activitypmhu/ml180−−11550 ± 610180200−11100 ± 300180600−11850 ± 210180−24210 ± 1018020024550 ± 6018060024800 ± 280mTNF was serially diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/FCS, with or without mTNF75, and directly or after a 24-h preincubation at 37 °C, 100 µl was added to wells containing L929 cells.

Bioactive TNF trimers, capable of clustering three TNF-R molecules on the cell surface, dissociate to inactive monomers during incubation at subnanomolar concentrations or by treatment with particular reagents, such as Triton X-100 or guanidinium chloride. This dissociation was shown to be reversible by enhancing the TNF concentration or by removing the chemical agent (12Corti A. Fassina G. Marcucci F. Barbanti E. Cassani G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Hlodan R. Pain R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present report we studied TNF stability during coincubation of different types of TNF and the influence of coincubation on the interaction with monoclonal antibodies and TNF-Rs. Using size-exclusion chromatography we showed that the appearance of labeled mTNF monomers was not only prevented by the presence of excess unlabeled mTNF but also by hTNF, whose amino acid sequence is 79% identical to mTNF. It may be noted that hTNF and mTNF form trimeric complexes with a similar three-dimensional structure, although detailed differences have been observed (15Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Baeyens K.J. De Bondt H.L. Raeymaekers A. Fiers W. De Ranter C.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Excess hLT-α, which is 32% identical to mTNF, did not mask this dissociation, indicating that the effect was specific and not because of a change in overall protein concentration. Intriguingly, coincubation of mTNF and hTNF at micromolar concentration resulted in the formation of two new TNF complexes. These could be discriminated from homotrimeric mTNF or hTNF by native PAGE and were recognized both with anti-mTNF and anti-hTNF antibodies. Finally, gel filtration clearly indicated that these complexes are trimeric. The experiments show that TNF trimer/monomer transitions occur both at subnanomolar and at micromolar concentrations. Because of these transitions TNF heterotrimeric molecules (A2B and AB2) are formed during coincubation of two different TNF species (A3and B3). Undoubtedly, the relative abundance of the different forms depends on several parameters, such as the initial concentration of TNF species, reaction temperature, and coincubation time. RIA experiments with monoclonal antibodies specific for mTNF (1F3F3) or hTNF (61E71) yield evidence that these heterotrimeric TNF molecules still interact with specific anti-TNF antibodies, indicating that their (trimer) conformation is similar to that of homotrimeric TNF complexes. To assess the binding of heterotrimeric TNF to mTNF-R, we preincubated unlabeled mTNF with labeled hTNF, which binds only to mTNF-RI, or with an mTNF75 mutein specific for mTNF-RII. We proceeded to measurement of the binding of label to immobilized smTNF-RI and smTNF-RII. In both situations label was retained by both types of receptor, indicating that the mTNF subunits present in heterotrimers still bind to both TNF-R types. These results imply that the receptor specificity and/or biological activity of a given mutein can be affected by coincubation with a different type of TNF. The resulting overall activity is then dependent on the specificities of the two partners. To rationalize this, we can consider the formation of heterotrimers between mTNF and mTNF75 (the latter does not bind to mTNF-RI and is therefore inactive in L929 assays). As the two mutations in mutein mTNF75 are oriented toward the same intersubunit groove, the heterotrimeric molecule (mTNF75/mTNF2) should have two wild-type intersubunit grooves and one mutated groove. It may be assumed that such a heterotrimeric molecule can bind three TNF-RII molecules or two TNF-RI molecules. Transfection studies with chimeric erythropoietin receptor (extracellular)/TNF-R (intracellular) constructs, which become dimerized after binding of erythropoietin, indicated that dimerization is sufficient to induce signal transduction (22Bazzoni F. Alejos E. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5376-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, studies with chimeric erythropoietin receptor/TNF-RII constructs showed that signaling after dimerization of TNF-RII (intracellular) is less efficient than after trimerization (23Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The fact that mTNF75 only partially restored mTNF bioactivity might have two explanations. First, part of the heterotrimers will have the mTNF752/mTNF conformation and hence be unable to induce clustering of TNF-RI. Second, it can be assumed that clustering/dimerization of TNF-RI after binding of an mTNF75/mTNF2 molecule will be less efficient in signal induction than trimerization with mTNF. The observation that mTNF75 partially prevents the decrease in mTNF bioactivity after preincubation confirms that heterotrimerization with this mutein can affect the overall bioactivity. This conclusion is also relevant to some in vivo experiments. Because endogenous TNF is induced after a single administration to monkeys of a TNF-RI-specific hTNF mutein (24Van Zee K.J. Stackpole S.A. Montegut W.J. Rogy M.A. Calvano S.E. Hsu K.C. Chao M. Meschter C.L. Loetscher H. Stüber D. Ettlin U. Wipf B. Lesslauer W. Lowry S.F. Moldawer L.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), endogenous TNF might also be induced by repeated administration of hTNF needed to obtain tolerization or to treat tumor-bearing mice (25Takahashi N. Brouckaert P. Bemelmans M.H.A. Buurman W.A. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi N. Fiers W. Brouckaert P. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is likely that in such in vivo situations monomer exchange occurs between administered and endogenous TNF. The effect of such exchanges on TNF pharmacokinetics or overall biological activity deserves further study. We are indebted to A. Raeymaekers and F.

BAP/TFII-I, a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation, is associated with Btk in B cells and is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine following B cell receptor engagement. BAP/TFII-I is a substrate for Btk in vitro and is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine upon coexpression with Btk in mammalian cells. In an effort to understand the physiologic consequences of BAP/TFII-I tyrosine phosphorylation following B cell receptor stimulation, site-directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide mapping were used to locate the predominant sites of BAP/TFII-I phosphorylation by Btk in vitro. These residues, Tyr248, Tyr357, and Tyr462, were also found to be the major sites for Btk-dependent phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I in vivo. Residues Tyr357 and Tyr462 are contained within the loop regions of adjacent helix-loop-helix-like repeats within BAP/TFII-I. Mutation of either Tyr248, Tyr357, or Tyr462 to phenylalanine reduced transcription from a c-fos promoter relative to wild-type BAP/TFII-I in transfected COS-7 cells, consistent with the interpretation that phosphorylation at these sites contributes to transcriptional activation.

Patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia exhibit an intrinsic defect in B cell development; peripheral B cells are rare and of an immature phenotype, but the number of pre-B cells in the bone marrow is not significantly reduced, consistent with impairment of the pre-B to B cell transition (3Pearl E.R.

A point mutation in the orthologous tyrosine kinase is responsible for an X-linked deficiency of B cell function (X-linked immunodeficiency, or xid) in the mouse (4Rawlings D.J. Saffran D.C.

Immunol. 1982; 33: 1-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Antibody responses to some T cell-independent antigens are absent, but responses to most T cell-dependent antigens are intact. Peripheral B cells are slightly reduced and skewed toward an immature phenotype. Survival of peripheral B cells is diminished, and the peritoneal B-1 B cell population is absent. Notably, xid mice do not exhibit the block in early B cell development observed in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Btk null mice exhibit a phenotype resembling xid, suggesting that B cell development has a more stringent requirement for Btk in humans than in mice (7Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. Parks D.R.

This group of kinases is related to the Src family by the presence of SH3, SH2, and SH1 (catalytic) domains. It is distinguished from the Src family by 1) the presence of pleckstrin homology and Tec homology domains, which serve as binding sites for phospholipids and SH3 domains, respectively; 2) the absence of an N-terminal myristoylation site; and 3) the lack of a regulatory tyrosine residue near the carboxyl terminus (11Siliciano J.D.

Immunol. 1999; 91: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Upon engagement of the B cell receptor, Btk is phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Lyn at residue Tyr551. This permits Btk to undergo autophosphorylation at residue Tyr223, after which kinase activity is increased (22Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.P. Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The activity of Btk can also be modulated by association with Gqα proteins (23Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), Gβγ proteins (24Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Wan Y. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A fraction of Btk coimmunoprecipitates with a protein of ∼135 kDa termed BAP (for Btk-associated protein); based on this association, BAP was purified, and its cDNA was molecularly cloned (26Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). BAP is identical to the putative transcription factor TFII-I (27Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which was identified by its ability to stimulate transcription from initiator elements (27Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and its synergy with Phox I and serum response factor in enhancing transcription from the c-fos promoter (28Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of BAP/TFII-I is the occurrence of six helix-loop-helix (HLH)-like repeats. In contrast to typical HLH motifs, however, which contain loop regions of between 6 and 20 amino acids (29Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), the HLH-like repeats of BAP/TFII-I contain extended loop regions of ∼70 amino acids (27Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Four isoforms of BAP/TFII-I, generated by alternative splicing of primary RNA transcripts, are differentially expressed in various tissues. Amino acid sequence differences among these four isoforms are confined to the interval between the first and second HLH-like domains (30Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 2H. Taylor, and S. Desiderio, unpublished results. Two sequence motifs resembling the Src kinase autophosphorylation consensus sequence (EDXDY) are present within this interval and are preserved in all four BAP/TFII-I isoforms. BAP/TFII-I is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine following B cell receptor engagement, with kinetics that closely follow tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk (26Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I is also observed upon cotransfection with Btk into fibroblastoid cells. This response is dependent upon Btk kinase activity, since cotransfection with the kinase-inactive mutant Btk(K430E) fails to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I (26Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These observations and the physical association of Btk with BAP/TFII-I in B lymphoid cells (26Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) suggested that BAP/TFII-I is a physiologic substrate for phosphorylation by Btk following B cell receptor stimulation. Several lines of evidence suggest that phosphorylation modulates the ability of BAP/TFII-I to stimulate transcription. First, dephosphorylation impairs the ability of BAP/TFII-I to stimulate transcription from a Vβ promoter in vitro, while sparing its ability to bind the Vβ initiator element (31Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33443-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Second, stimulation of Vβ transcription by BAP/TFII-I in transfected cells is enhanced by wild-type Btk but not by a kinase-inactive mutant (32Novina C.D. Kumar S. Bajpai U. Cheriyath V. Zhang K. Pillai S. Wortis H.H. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5014-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Third, the transcriptional activity of BAP/TFII-I in transfected cells is impaired by mutation of a site conforming to the Src autophosphorylation consensus (31Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33443-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fourth, epidermal growth factor, which enhances c-fos promoter activity, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I (33Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). While these observations are consistent with the interpretation that Btk activates BAP/TFII-I by tyrosine phosphorylation, definitive evidence is lacking. As an essential step in defining a regulatory relationship between Btk and BAP/TFII-I, we have mapped the major Btk phosphorylation sites in BAP/TFII-I. Bacterially expressed, purified Btk phosphorylates BAP/TFII-I at three predominant sites: Tyr248, Tyr357, and Tyr462. The first site lies in the interrepeat region between the first and second HLH-like domains; the two other sites are at analogous positions in putative loop regions of the second and third HLH-like domains. When Btk is coexpressed with BAP/TFII-I in mammalian cells, BAP/TFII-I is specifically hyperphosphorylated at the same three sites. Btk-specific hyperphosphorylation of a BAP/TFII-I fragment in vivo was eliminated by mutation of these sites to phenylalanine. The ability of BAP/TFII-I to stimulate expression of a c-fos reporter, in COS-7 cells was impaired by mutation of Tyr248, Tyr357, or Tyr462 to phenylalanine, consistent with the interpretation that phosphorylation of these sites plays a role in transcriptional activation. Phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I by Btk, and perhaps other Tec-related kinases, may link engagement of receptors such as surface immunoglobulin to modulation of gene expression. Plasmid pBAPmyc, encoding the shortest isoform of BAP/TFII-I (BAP/TFII-I A), fused at the carboxyl terminus to a Pro-Gly linker and the c-Myc epitope EQKLISEEDL, was constructed from a BAP cDNA clone (26Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction. The plasmid pBAPmyc(BN) was generated from pBAPmyc by introduction of SalI, XbaI, and in-frameBamHI sites 5′ of the BAP/TFII-I coding sequence. The following BAP/TFII-I carboxyl- and amino-truncations were constructed from pBAPmyc(BN) using polymerase chain reaction: pBAP-N-1R (residues 1–189), pBAP-N-NR2 (residues 1–303), pBAP-N-2R (residues 1–398), pBAP-N-3R (residues 1–503), pBAP-4R-CT (residues 514–957), and pBAP-5R-CT (residues 675–957). All constructs share an identical initiation sequence (34Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and a carboxyl-terminal c-Myc epitope. Tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutations were introduced using divergent polymerase chain reaction (35Jones D.H. Winistorfer S.C. BioTechniques. 1992; 12 (, 532, 534–535): 528-530PubMed Google Scholar). The identities of mutant constructs were verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. For expression of c-Myc-tagged BAP/TFII-I and BAP truncation proteins in Escherichia coli under inducible control of thearaBAD promoter, the BamHI/EcoRV fragments of pBAPmyc(BN) and its derivatives, encoding full-length BAP/TFII-I or BAP/TFII-I truncation proteins, were inserted between theBglII and PvuII sites of pBADHisB (Invitrogen). For eukaryotic expression studies, the SalI/NotI fragments of pBAPmyc(BN) and its derivatives, encoding full-length or truncated BAP/TFII-I proteins, were inserted between theXhoI and NotI sites of pCIS2 (36Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar). Btk pCIS2 and Btk mutant K430E pCIS2 have been described (37Yang W. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20832-20840Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Plasmids for bacterial expression of Btk (pMal-C2Btk) or Btk(K430E) (pMal-C2Bke), fused at the amino terminus to maltose-binding protein (MBP), were constructed by inserting the 2-kilobase pairBamHI fragments of pCIS2Btk and pCIS2Btk(K430E) into theBamHI site of pMal-C2 (New England Biolabs). A reporter construct containing the murine c-fos wild-type promoter (33Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of D. Kim and B. Cochran. TheHindII fragment containing the c-fos promoter was cloned into the HindII site upstream of the firefly luciferase gene within the Promega PGL3 basic vector, and orientation was confirmed by sequence analysis. The herpes simplex thymidine kinaseRenilla vector (pRL-TK) was purchased from Promega. The human embryonic kidney fibroblast cell line 293 and the simian fibroblast cell line COS-7 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. E. coli BL21, transformed with either pMal-C2Btk or pMal-C2Bke, was cultured overnight at 37° C in 50 ml of rich medium containing 2 g/liter glucose and 50 µg/ml carbenicillin. The overnight cultures were diluted 1:20 in the same medium and grown at 37 °C until A 600was 0.5. Expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.3 mm, and incubation was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of buffer F (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml chymostatin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, and 2 µg/ml antipain) per 500-ml culture. Lysozyme and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to 1 mg/ml and 1 mm, respectively. After incubation for 30 min on ice, bacterial suspensions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. MBP-Btk and MBP-Btk(K430E) fusion proteins were purified by amylose affinity chromatography (New England Biolabs). Frozen bacterial suspensions were thawed in a 30 °C water bath with gentle agitation and then placed on ice. Ice-cold EDTA was added for a final concentration of 2 mm, and EGTA was added for a final concentration of 10 mm. After mixing by inversion, the lysate was sonicated for three cycles of 10 pulses each with a Branson microtip sonifier (power output 5, duty cycle 50%). An equal volume (25 ml) of lysate dilution buffer (300 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 2% Nonidet P-40, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml chymostatin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, and 2 µg/ml antipain) was added to 25 ml of bacterial suspension. Suspensions were mixed by inversion, incubated on ice for 20 min, and then clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded twice over a 2-ml amylose resin, pre-equilibrated with wash buffer 1 (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml chymostatin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, and 2 µg/ml antipain). The column was washed sequentially with 10 ml of wash buffer 1, 10 ml of wash buffer 1 supplemented to 1 m NaCl, and 10 ml of wash buffer 2 (100 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). Bound protein was eluted with 3 ml of elution buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm maltose, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). Eluates were dialyzed against elution buffer lacking maltose, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Wild-type and mutant BAP/TFII-I fragments, tagged at the amino terminus with polyhistidine, were expressed from the BAP pBAD HIS constructs in E. coli (TOP10; Invitrogen). Bacterial cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C in 2× YT containing 50 µg/ml carbenicillin, diluted 1:10 in the same medium, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Expression was induced by the addition of arabinose to 0.002% (w/v) and further incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer F (25 ml per 500-ml culture). After the addition of lysozyme to 1 mg/ml and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mm, bacterial suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Bacterial suspensions were thawed with gentle agitation in a 30 °C water bath and placed on ice immediately upon thawing. Samples were sonicated for three cycles of 10 pulses each with a Branson microtip sonifier (power output 5, duty cycle 50%). One volume of 2× imidazole wash buffer (500 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 40 mm imidazole) containing 0.4% Tween 20 was added, and samples were incubated on ice for 20 min. Lysis was completed by sonication for two cycles of 10 pulses each (output 5, duty cycle 50%). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, diluted 2-fold with imidazole wash buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm imidazole) and loaded twice onto Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Invitrogen). Columns were washed with 50 bed volumes of imidazole wash buffer, followed by 2 volumes of imidazole pre-elution buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm imidazole, 15% glycerol). Samples were eluted with 1 bed volume of imidazole elution buffer (300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 10% glycerol); dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol; frozen in liquid nitrogen; and stored at −80 °C.

Purified MBP-Btk or MBP-Btk(K430E) (2 µg in 5 µl) was added to a total volume of 40 µl, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. Products were fractionated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF (Millipore Corp.) for tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method (38Paborsky L.R. Fendly B.M. Fisher K.L. Lawn R.M. Marks B.J. McCray G. Tate K.M. Vehar G.A. Gorman C.M. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transiently transfected with 5 µg of wild-type or mutant BAP/TFII-I expression constructs in pCIS2, 5 µg of pCIS2Btk or pCIS2Btk(K430E), and 1 µg of pRSVT. At 40 h after transfection, cells were labeled for 4 h at 37 °C with 250 µCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Cells were treated for 10 min at 37 °C with 1 mm sodium pervanadate, washed once with 5 ml of cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm EDTA, collected by centrifugation, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa2MoO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 µg/ml pepstatin, 2.5 µg/ml antipain, and 1 µg/ml chymostatin) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Epitope-tagged BAP/TFII-I was immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 for 1 h on ice. Following the addition of 25 µl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), suspensions were rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times for 10 min each in radioimmune precipitation buffer; immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized in SDS-loading buffer and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein was transferred to PVDF (Millipore) for tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Tryptic phosphopeptides were prepared according to methods previously described (39Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 210: 110-153Google Scholar) and analyzed by alkaline gel electrophoresis (40West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, PVDF membrane slices containing phosphoproteins were excised, washed with water, and then soaked in 0.5% polyvinylpyrolidone (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Membranes were then washed five times with water and once with freshly prepared 0.05 mNH4HCO3. Immobilized proteins were digested with 1 ml of 0.3 mg/ml trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, Sigma) in 0.05 mNH4HCO3 overnight at 37 °C. Supernatants were dried under vacuum and washed three times in water. Dried pellets were dissolved in 10 µl of sample buffer (0.125 mTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6 m urea) and fractionated on a 40% alkaline gel as described (40West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were detected by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The ability of BAP/TFII-I to stimulate transcription from the c-fospromoter was assessed as previously described (33Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with modifications. COS-7 cells, grown to 80–90% confluence, were trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids (NEAA), and seeded in 24-well plates at 6 × 104 cells/well. Cells were transfected 16–20 h later using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each well was transfected with 0.1 µg of c-fos in PGL3, 0.1 µg of pRL-TK, and 0.6 µg of either pCIS2 or wild-type or mutant BAPmyc in pCIS2. For each well, 1 µl of LipofectAMINE 2000 was diluted in 50 µl of OPTI-MEM (Life Technologies), incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and then combined with DNA diluted in 50 µl of OPTI-MEM. Complexes were allowed to form for 30 min at room temperature and then added to each well, which contained 250 ml of fresh DMEM containing 0.1 mm NEAA. After 5 h at 37 °C, medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. At 36–40 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 10% FBS for 5 h. Cells were then lysed in 100 ml of passive lysis buffer and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using the Promegadual luciferase kit, and c-fos reporter activity was assessed as the ratio of firefly to Renilla activities. The effects of Btk and BAP/TFII-I on the activity of the c-fospromoter were assessed as above, except that transfections contained 0.4 µg of pCIS2 vector or pCIS2-BAP/TFII-I and 0.3 µg of pCIS2Btk or pCIS2Btk(K430E). The overall strategy used in these phosphorylation site mapping studies was 1) to determine which portions of BAP/TFII-I are phosphorylated by Btk in vitro; 2) to define the specific tyrosine residues phosphorylated by Btk in vitro by a combination of phosphopeptide mapping and site-directed mutagenesis; and 3) to verify that the same tyrosine residues are hyperphosphorylated in vivo upon coexpression of BAP/TFII-I with active Btk. The shortest BAP/TFII-I isoform, BAP/TFII-I A, contains all 24 tyrosine residues present in the larger isoforms (Fig.1A).2 This isoform and its derivative polypeptide fragments were therefore used forin vitro phosphorylation site mapping. The following BAP/TFII-I protein fragments, fused at the amino terminus to polyhistidine and the carboxyl terminus to a c-Myc epitope, were expressed in bacterial cells and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Fig.1 B): BAP N-3R (residues 1–503), BAP N-2R (residues 1–398), BAP N-NR2 (residues 1–303), BAP N-1R (residues 1–189), BAP 4R-CT (residues 514–957), and BAP 5R-CT (residues 675–957). Wild-type BAP/TFII-I, tagged with polyhistidine and a c-Myc epitope, was expressed and purified in parallel. To define the sites at which Btk phosphorylates BAP/TFII-I in vitro, it was essential to obtain active Btk in a form free of contaminating tyrosine kinases. Btk immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells was unsatisfactory for this purpose, since pilot experiments with a kinase-inactive mutant Btk revealed the presence of additional tyrosine kinase activities in such preparations. Recovery of catalytically active Btk, expressed inE. coli, has been demonstrated (23Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).

Each year 300–500 million people are infected by malaria parasites, and this results in 1.5–3 million deaths (1World Health Organization Fact Sheet N94. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1998Google Scholar). Efforts to eradicate malaria generally have failed, and currently the disease is endemic in more than 90 countries throughout the tropics. Widespread and increasing drug and insecticide resistance have exacerbated the situation, undermining the effectiveness of existing malaria control methods that depend on chemotherapy and vector control, respectively. Novel means to fight the disease are needed urgently, and a vaccine is predicted to have the greatest impact in addition to being the most cost-effective control measure (2Miller L.H. Hoffman S.L. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Experimental support for the development of a vaccine for human malaria was provided first by the use of radiation-attenuated sporozoites as immunogens (3Clyde D.F. Most H. McCarthy V.C. Vanderberg J.P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1973; 266: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The success of this experimental vaccination provided the impetus for the search for mechanisms of protective immune responses and the target antigens involved. The circumsporozoite (CS) protein was identified as the major surface antigen ofPlasmodium sporozoites (4Yoshida N. Nussenzweig R.S. Potocnjak P. Nussenzweig V. Aikawa M. Science. 1980; 207: 71-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 5Zavala F. Cochrane A.H. Nardin E.H. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp.

Science. 1984; 225: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The CS protein has been a leading vaccine candidate antigen because irradiated sporozoite-induced, protected human volunteers have high titers of anti-CS1 antibodies (7Herrington D. Davis J. Nardin E.H. Beier M. Cortese J. Eddy H. Losonsky G. Hollingdale M.R. Sztein M. Levine M. Nussenzweig R.S. Clyde D.F. Edelman R. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1991; 5: 539-547Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and CS-specific monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes could adoptively transfer protection in a rodent malaria model system (8Weiss W.R. Berzovsky J.A. Houghten R.A. Sedegah M. Hollingdale M.R. Hoffman S.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2103-2109PubMed Google Scholar). However, attempts to induce protection in humans using P. falciparum CS-based vaccines, despite recent improvement in their immunogenicity, have repeatedly yielded only partial success (9Ballou W.R. Hoffman S.L. Sherwood J.A. Hollingdale M.R. Neva F.A. Hockmeyer W.T. Gordon D.M. Schneider I. Wirtz R.A. Young J.F. Wasserman G.F. Reeve P. Diggs C.L. Chulay J.D.

Dis. 1998; 178: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The inability to develop a vaccine based on the CS protein was interpreted to indicate that additional antigens play a role in irradiated sporozoite-mediated protection against infection (14Galey B. Druilhe P. Ploton I. Desgranges C. Asavanich A. Harinasuta T. Marchand C. Brahimi K. Charoenvit Y. Paul C. Young J. Gross M. Beaudoin R.L. Infect. Immun. 1990; 9: 2995-3001Crossref Google Scholar). It then becomes important to identify antigens that may act independently, additively or synergistically with the CS protein in the development of a multicomponent vaccine. Here we report the characterization ofMB2, a novel gene encoding a P. falciparumsporozoite surface antigen identified by screening a CS-depleted sporozoite expression cDNA library with serum from a human volunteer protected by the bites of P. falciparum-infected and irradiated mosquitoes. The MB2 gene is expressed in sporozoites, the exoerythrocytic stages, the asexual blood stages, and gametocytes, but the gene product is localized differentially in these developmental stages. This differential localization provides multiple opportunities to exploit the MB2 gene product as a vaccine and drug target. A CS-depleted sporozoite cDNA library was constructed from a P. falciparumsalivary gland sporozoite cDNA library (strain NF54; Ref. 15Fidock D.A. Nguyen T.V. Ribeiro J.M. Valenzuela J.G. James A.A. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 95: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) using a hydroxyapatite column-based subtractive hybridization technique (16Usui H. Falk J.D. Dopazo A. Lecea L.D. Erlander M.G. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to prepare the target cDNA sense-strands, DNA from the unsubtracted library was linearized with NotI and used as a template to transcribe antisense cRNAs with T7 RNA polymerase (Megascript, Ambion). Template DNA was removed by DNase treatment and the antisense cRNA strands were used to generate cDNA sense strands in a reaction using SuperScript (Life Technologies, Inc.) reverse transcriptase. To prepare the driver cRNA, a CS clone, G89 (17McCutchan T.F. Hansen J.L. Dame J.B. Mullins J.A. Science. 1984; 225: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was linearized with NotI. Digestion products were used to generate antisense CS cRNA with T7 RNA polymerase (Megascript, Ambion). The target cDNA sense strands were allowed to reassociate with a 50-fold excess of the driver cRNA antisense strands. The reassociation mix was loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column and non-duplex, single-stranded target cDNA was separated from duplex cDNA/cRNA by elution with a high molarity phosphate buffer. Primers specific for the UniZap λ phage vector (Stratagene) were used to amplify the subtracted cDNA, and the amplification products were subcloned into the phage arms of the UniZap vector and packaged. Phage were plated and lifted onto nitrocellulose membranes that were soaked in 10 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside and air-dried prior to use. Membranes were incubated in the serum of human volunteer 5 2W. O. Rogers, unpublished data. at a 1:100 dilution, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG+IgM were used to detect positive antibody reactions by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Positive phage were screened a second time to isolate single phage clones. Additional cDNA and genomic clones (strain ITO) were recovered using MB2-derived32P-labeled probes and standard library-screening techniques (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The primary nucleotide sequences of all clones were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52605) Google Scholar) using a 33P nucleotide terminator kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Specific oligonucleotide primers for sequencing were made by Heligen Laboratories (Huntington Beach, CA). Contiguity of clones was verified by gene amplification of genomic DNA using the following primers: a, 5′-GGTGATGACATTGAAGATATGAATG-3′; b, 5′-CAATAGAATAGATATAATCACC; c, 5′-CTGGGTCATCATATGGAAAAGTG-3′; and d, 5′-CAATACACCCTGCAACCTTTCC-3′. P. falciparum genomic DNA was isolated using a phenol/chloroform-based procedure (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) from blood-stage parasites (strain FCR3) cultured in vitro. The DNA was digested with various restriction endonucleases, and Southern blots were prepared as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probe for Southern blot analyses was prepared by labeling the sporozoite cDNA clone, spz-MB2, with radioactive [32P]ATP using the Megaprime DNA system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from blood-stage parasites of the same strain cultured in vitro using the Trizol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 15–20 µg of total RNA were electrophoresed and Northern blots were prepared as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two 32P-labeled probes consisting of nucleotides 1–580 and 2393–2836 of the coding sequence ofMB2 were used separately on filters to which RNA from blood-stage parasites had been transferred. Segments of the MB2 open reading frame (ORF) were expressed in bacteria as GST-MB2–6xHis fusion proteins from the dual-affinity expression vector, pAK1–6H (20Stratmann T. Schmid S.R. Harper J. Kang A.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). NcoI and SmaI cloning sites were created for each insert by amplifying NF54 strain genomic DNA. The primer pair, 5′-GATGCCATGGAATATAATAGAATATGCTCA-3′ and 5′-GATCCCGGGTTTTTATTATTAGAAGAATCA-3′, was used to amplify a sequence that encodes a peptide, designated MB2-B, that overlaps amino acids (aa) 95–206. The primer pair, 5′-GATGCCATGGATTCTTCTAATAATAAAAAT-3′ and 5′-ATGCATCCCCGGGTCATTTTTTATTTGAAGAATTCTC-3′, was used to amplify a sequence that encodes a second peptide, designated MB2-C, that overlaps aa 200–316. The primer pair, 5′-GTATGCCATGGTCCACGAAAATAAAGAATATAATTCAAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCGGGTCATCGAGCGATTCATTTTGGTC-3′, was used to amplify a sequence encoding the peptide, MB2-FA, that overlaps aa 764–945. Finally, the primer pair, 5′-GATGCCATGGATGG TAATAGAACAAATAATGAC-3′ and 5′-GATCCCGGGTACGCTTCGATTATATCGTTTGGCTC-3′, was used to amplify a sequence that encodes the peptide, MB2-IF2, that overlaps aa 1337–1606. The amplification products were digested withNcoI and SmaI and ligated into pAK1–6H. The ligation mixture was used to transform Escherichia coliDH10B, and transformants were selected. Bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C in SuperBroth (Life Technologies, Inc.) to anA 600 = 0.6 and induced in 1 mm final concentration of isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 3–4 h to express recombinant proteins. Purification of recombinant proteins was done using the ProBond resin (Invitrogen) modified by the inclusion of imidazole at 85 mm final concentration in the washing buffer. Eluted fractions were analyzed for the presence of recombinant proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. 400 µg of purified recombinant protein were injected subcutaneously into a rabbit four times at 2-week intervals. Ten days following the last injection, high titer sera were obtained from the rabbit. The sera were depleted of anti-GST antibodies by chromatography on GST-bound nickel columns. P. falciparumparasites and parasite-infected cells or tissues were fixed for 30 min at 4 °C with 1% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH = 7.4. Fixed samples were washed, dehydrated and embedded in LR White resin (Polysciences, Inc.). Thin sections (70–80 nm) were blocked in a phosphate buffer containing 5% w/v nonfat dry milk and 0.01% v/v Tween 20 (21Aikawa M. Atkinson C.T. Adv. Parasitol. 1990; 29: 151-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Grids were incubated at 4 °C overnight in solutions containing variable concentrations of rabbit antiserum reactive to domain-specific recombinant proteins diluted in the blocking buffer. Pre-immune sera were used as negative controls. After washing, grids were incubated for 1 h in 15 nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:40 in phosphate buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Tween 20. Following the 1-h incubation, grids were rinsed with phosphate buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Tween 20 and fixed with glutaraldehyde to stabilize the gold particles. Samples were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined by electron microscopy. Protein extracts from parasites were prepared by boiling them in sample buffer for 10 min (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). For the sporozoite stage, parasites were isolated from dissected salivary glands of infected mosquitoes. For the asexual blood stages, parasites were obtained from a saponin lysis of infected red blood cells grown in culture (23Hyde J.E. Read M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 133-143PubMed Google Scholar). Protein extracts were fractionated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated in rabbit antiserum diluted 1:500 for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was used to detect positive signals using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Preimmune sera and lysates from uninfected human red blood cells were used as negative controls. To evaluate the efficiency of CS depletion in the subtracted cDNA library, 100 ng of the recovered single-stranded cDNA were amplified with oligonucleotide primers complementary to the cloning vector to generate a heterogeneous mixture of fragments of 200–1000 bp in size. The products were amplified again with gene-specific primers. Although two marker genes, TRAP(24Robson K.J. Hall J.R. Jennings M.W. Harris T.J. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Tate V.E. Weatherall D.J.

Parasitol. 1998; 89: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), were detected, no signal corresponding to the CS gene was amplified, indicating that the subtraction technique was highly efficient (data not shown). The amplification products were subcloned into the UniZap vector and packaged in λ phage, producing a library of 1.45 × 106 primary phage. A screening of 1 × 104 primary phage with the human volunteer serum led to the selection of 18 candidate phage clones. These were rescreened, and 12 phage again were reactive for antibodies. Southern analyses showed that 1 of the 12 secondary clones hybridized specifically to P. falciparum genomic DNA and showed patterns of hybridization consistent with a single-copy gene (Fig.1 A). This 496-bp sporozoite cDNA clone was designated spz-MB2 and was selected for further characterization. Northern analyses of RNA isolated from blood-stage parasites cultured in vitro and hybridized with probes derived from both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the complete ORF (described below) produced a single positive signal at ∼7.5 kilobases (Fig. 1 B). A comparison of the size of the spz-MB2 cDNA with the mRNA detected in the Northern analyses indicates that it is not a full-length cDNA. Furthermore, primary sequencing ofspz-MB2 showed that it lacked a translation termination codon and represented an incomplete ORF. Sequence complementary toMB2 was detected in an asexual blood-stage cDNA library using specific gene amplification primers, and therefore the library was screened with the spz-MB2 cDNA. Two overlapping blood-stage cDNAs, c3–1-18 and c18–4-23, were identified (Fig. 2 A). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the reading frame ofspz-MB2 was contained entirely within a contig formed by these two cDNAs. The c3–1-18 clone contained a putative translation initiation codon and a 435-bp 5′ end untranslated region (UTR). The 3′ end termini of the c3–1-18 andc18–4-23 cDNAs each have what appear to be polyadenylation (poly(A)) sequences characteristic of the 3′ end termini of processed mRNAs. However, there were no translation termination codons located to the 5′ end of the poly (A) tracks in either of the cDNAs, and the overlap of c3–1-18 withc18–4-23 revealed that the 17 terminal A nucleotides inc3–1-18 comprise an internal A-rich nucleotide stretch inc18–4-23. Therefore, we concluded that the oligo(dT) primed the mRNA for cDNA synthesis from within the coding region. To obtain additional 3′ end sequence of MB2, aSau3AI genomic library (strain ITO) was screened using as a probe the 400 nucleotides at the 3′ end of c18–4-23. A genomic clone, g2–4-4#5, was identified having overlapping and contiguous sequence with c18–4-23. The sequence ofg2–4-4#5 confirmed that the 17-A region at the 3′ end ofc18–4-23 is an internal A-rich nucleotide track, supporting the conclusion that these A-rich internal nucleotide tracks were primed by oligo(dT). To obtain additional 3′ end cDNA sequence, the 600 nucleotides at the 3′ end of g2–4-4#5 were used to screen the blood-stage cDNA library, resulting in the identification of the cDNA clone, c3–4-29. Sequencing ofc3–4-29 revealed that it was contiguous withc18–4-23. In addition, there are three stop codons at the 3′ end of c-3–4-29, commencing at nucleotides 5266, 5272, and 5293, and there is a putative poly(A) region near the 3′ end of the last stop codon. The positions of the stop codons and the authenticity of the poly(A) of the MB2 cDNA were supported by the genomic clone, g6–2-2, identified by screening the genomic library with a probe derived from the 3′ end of c3–4-29. Similarly, the 5′ end UTR and the start codon of MB2 also were verified by the clone g2–6-8, isolated from the genomic library using a probe derived from the 5′ end ofc3–1-18. The overlapping primary sequences of the three blood-stage cDNA clones and the contiguity of their reading frames allowed us to assemble a complete ORF of MB2 that is 4830 nucleotides in length, of which 77% of the bases are A-T pairs (data not shown). No nucleotide polymorphisms were observed among the cDNA and genomic sequences, indicating that there is a single allele of the MB2 gene encoded and expressed in the parasite strains used in our analyses. Because the nucleotide sequences of the three genomic clones did not overlap, we designed gene amplification primers a, b, c, and d (Fig.2 A) to assess the contiguity of the MB2 gene in the parasite genome. Amplification products produced by the primer pairs a+b and c+d with parasite genomic DNA as the template gave the predicted product sizes, ∼700 and ∼1000 bp, respectively (data not shown), indicating that MB2 is organized as a contiguous, single-exon gene in the parasite genome. MB2 encodes a putative translation product that is 1610 aa in length with an approximate molecular mass of 187 kDa (Fig. 2, B and C). The predicted protein is rich in asparagine (15%) and lysine (13%) and is strongly basic with a calculated net charge of +20 at pH 7 and a pI of 8.3. The primary amino acid sequence can be separated into three distinct, linear domains, the first of which is an amino-terminal basic domain of 490 residues (aa 1–490) with a calculated net charge of +30 and a pI of 9.4. We have designated this the “B” domain. This domain contains a region of six 9-aa imperfect repeats (aa 211–264) with the consensus sequence L, N, S, K, K, N, D/N, N, T/S. The central acidic domain, designated “A,” encompasses 496 residues (aa 491–986) with a calculated net charge of −6.2 and a pI of 6.1. The boundary between the B and A domains was selected to maximize the basic and acidic properties of the respective domains. The A domain contains two regions of imperfect repeats of 5 amino acids. The first region (aa 493–542) contains 10 repeats with a consensus sequence of D, N, Q/P, N, Y. The second region (aa 870–914) contains nine repeats with a consensus of I/M, N/D, V, Q, D. No similarities to any sequences of known function deposited in the data bases were detected for either the B or A domains. Finally, a 624-residue carboxyl-terminal domain (aa 987–1610) with sequence similarity to the GTP-binding domain of the prokaryotic translation initiation factor 2, IF2, as revealed by the BLAST search program (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59748) Google Scholar) has been designated “G.” The boundary between the A and G domains was selected based on the start of the regions of similarity of theMB2 protein with known IF2 molecules. In contrast to its overall hydrophilic nature, the MB2 polypeptide contains at the amino terminus a strongly hydrophobic region (aa 1–25) mapped by a Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plot. The PSORT computer program (28Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) predicted an uncleavable signal peptide in the hydrophobic amino-terminal region of MB2. However, the SignalP program (29Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar) predicted that the signal peptide could be cleaved between a pair of S-S residues at aa 27–28 (Fig. 2 C). Currently, we have no experimental data that support one alternative over the other. The PSORT program also predicted a number of nuclear localization signals (NLS), PKKK (aa 120–123), RRKK (aa 173–176), KKKKK (aa 652–656), and a bipartite NLS, KKNKELPFNNKFKKIIK (aa 718–734), within the B and A domains. Multiple putative sites for N-glycosylation,N-myristoylation, and phosphorylation were detected by the ScanProsite program (Ref. 30Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar; data not shown). There is a polybasic motif, KKKKKGKSRKK (aa 956–966), just before the start of the G domain, that could function as a plasma membrane localization signal as well as a cell-surface retention sequence (CRS) (31Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). This sequence also could be a putative NLS, although PSORT failed to identify it as such. The similarity of the G domain to the GTP-binding domains of the prokaryotic IF2 proteins includes the conservation of sequence and spacing of three motifs, GX 4GK (aa 999–1005), DX 2K (aa 1046–1049), and NKXD (aa 1100–1104), common to this family of proteins (32Dever T.E. Glynias M.V. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). There is a small variation in the third motif, TKXD, in MB2 as compared with the consensus seen in other G proteins (Fig. 2 C). Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) was used to study the subcellular localization of theMB2 antigen. All rabbit antisera prepared against recombinant peptides derived from the B and A domains (Fig.2 A), and reacted with sectioned material containing sporozoites, showed that MB2 protein was localized predominantly to the surface (Fig. 3,A–D). This was true of sporozoites in salivary glands (Fig.3, A and B), as well as those that invadedin vitro cells of the human liver cell line, HepG2-A16 (Fig.3, C and D). No antibody reaction was detected with sporozoites using the anti-G domain antibody (data not shown). Preimmune control sera for all reagents were negative (data not shown). In contrast, the majority of the MB2 protein detected in blood-stage parasites using both antisera against the B domain was localized in the nucleus, with some antibody reactivity detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, E and F) and data not shown). Rabbit antisera against the A and G domains detected protein only in the cytoplasm of these parasites (Fig. 3 G and data not shown). Furthermore, the numbers of gold particles observed in sections of parasites exposed to antibodies against the A and G domains were low when compared with the signal produced by the anti-B domain antisera, indicating probably that the majority of MB2 protein present at the blood stages does not contain the A and G domains. MB2 protein was detected in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and parasitophorous vacuole (PV) space of gametocyte-stage parasites using the anti-B domain antiserum (Fig. 3 H). MB2protein detected by the anti-A domain antiserum was localized only in the PV space (Fig. 3 I), indicating that the protein detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm with the anti-B domain antiserum does not contain the A domain. The anti-G domain antiserum produced a high background signal, making it difficult to interpret any specific localization pattern. Finally, we attempted to use IEM to look at the localization ofMB2 protein in the exoerythrocytic stages of the parasite. A section of the liver of an infected Aotus monkey was reacted with the anti-B domain antiserum. It is hard to locate the parasites in these sections, but we were able to find some that revealed that the protein is localized mostly in the cytoplasm with some in the PV space (Fig. 3 J). Sections reacted with the anti-A domain antiserum had high backgrounds obscuring any evidence of a specific localization pattern. A series of immunoblotting experiments were performed with parasite protein extracts prepared from the sporozoite and blood stages to determine the relative size of theMB2 protein (Fig. 4). Both anti-B and anti-A domain antisera detected a single polypeptide of ∼120 kDa at the sporozoite stage (Fig. 4, A andB). No immunoblot analyses were done on sporozoite preparations with anti-G domain antiserum because of the negative results obtained in the IEM analyses. Immunoblotting using anti-B domain antibody detected a single polypeptide of ∼66 kDa at the blood stages (Fig. 4 C). Furthermore, the 66-kDa polypeptide was not detected with either the anti-A or anti-G domain antibodies (Fig.4 D and data not shown). These data are consistent with the IEM study and indicate that the MB2 polypeptide located at the surface of sporozoites consists of only the B and A domains, and the polypeptide translocated into the nucleus of parasites at the blood stages consists primarily of the B domain. A major difficulty in immunoscreening of expression libraries to identify P. falciparum sporozoite antigens is the abundant and immunodominant characteristics of the CS protein. The abundant expression of the CS gene results in its representation in high frequency in cDNA libraries (15Fidock D.A. Nguyen T.V. Ribeiro J.M. Valenzuela J.G. James A.A. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 95: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and its immunodominant repeat domain induces a high antibody titer in the host providing the screening antiserum (7H"
