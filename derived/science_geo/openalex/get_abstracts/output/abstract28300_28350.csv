https://openalex.org/W1963620791,"The existence of a computer-predicted cloverleaf structure for the first 100 nucleotides at the 5' end of poliovirus RNA was verified by site-directed mutagenesis and by chemical and RNAase probing. Mutations that modified the cloverleaf in the positive strand but not the negative strand were lethal to the virus. This RNA cloverleaf structure binds a cellular protein and the viral proteins 3Cpro and 3Dpol. Mutations in specific regions of the RNA cloverleaf prevented this binding. Mutations in either 3Cpro or the RNA that disrupted ribonucleoprotein complex formation inhibited virus growth and selectively affected positive strand RNA accumulation. Phenotypic reversion of these mutations restored the ability to form the complex. Thus, a cloverleaf structure in poliovirus RNA plays a central role in organizing viral and cellular proteins involved in positive strand production."
https://openalex.org/W1991536902,"A human poliovirus receptor (PVR) gene was used to generate transgenic mice that express PVR transcripts and poliovirus binding sites in a wide range of tissues. Intracerebral inoculation of PVR transgenic mice with poliovirus type 1, Mahoney strain, resulted in viral replication in the brain and spinal cord and development of paralytic poliomyelitis. P1/Mahoney did not replicate or cause paralysis in nontransgenic mice. PVR transgenic mice failed to develop clinical disease when inoculated intracerebrally with the live attenuated Sabin type 1 vaccine strain. These results demonstrate that the PVR is the major determinant of poliovirus host range in mice. Transgenic mice expressing human PVR should be useful for studying poliovirus neurovirulence, attenuation, and tissue tropism, and for development and testing of poliovirus vaccine strains."
https://openalex.org/W165372149,"An hepatic protein kinase that phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) on Ser/Thr residues is markedly activated after intraperitoneal injection of cycloheximide in the rat. The enzyme has been purified greater than 10,000-fold to near homogeneity and corresponds to a 54-kDa polypeptide, based on auto-phosphorylation, renaturation of activity from sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, and gel filtration. The protein kinase activity is unaffected by prior autophosphorylation, Ca2+, diacylglycerol and phospholipids, cyclic nucleotides, staurosporine, and protein kinase inhibitor, but can be totally and specifically deactivated by the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A. The enzyme is inhibited completely but reversible by transition metals and p-chloromercuribenzoate, and is strongly stimulated by poly-L-lysine toward most, but not all protein substrates. The activity of the cycloheximide-stimulated MAP-2 kinase (pp54 MAP-2 kinase) toward potential polypeptide substrates was compared to that of an insulin-stimulated MAP-2 kinase (pp42 MAP-2 kinase). Although both MAP-2 kinases exhibited little or no ability to phosphorylate histones and casein, the two kinases had a distinguishable substrate specificity. At comparable MAP-2 phosphorylating activities, pp42 MAP-2 kinase, but not pp54 MAP-2 kinase, phosphorylated and activated the Xenopus S6 protein kinase II. Moreover, pp42 MAP-2 kinase phosphorylated myelin basic protein at 10-12-fold higher rates than did pp54 MAP-2 kinase. Cycloheximide-activated pp54 MAP-2 protein kinase appears to be a previously uncharacterized protein kinase that is itself regulated through Ser/Thr phosphorylation and, perhaps, polypeptide regulators with basic domains. The identity of the upstream regulatory elements and the native substrates remain to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1508055552,"Agonist-stimulated divalent cation entry was studied in fura-2-loaded hepatocytes. In the presence of extracellular Mn2+, the Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormone vasopressin produced a severalfold stimulation of the basal rate of fura-2 fluorescence quenching as a result of Mn2+ influx; this effect was blocked by the presence of Ni2+ in the incubation medium. Half-maximum and maximum stimulation of Mn2+ influx was observed with 0.1 and 0.8 nM vasopressin, respectively. Agonist-stimulated Mn2+ influx was also seen with angiotensin II, ATP, phenylephrine, and the combination of AlCl3 and NaF. The stimulation of Mn2+ influx did not occur immediately after addition of Ca2(+)-mobilizing agents, but was characterized by a latency period of 20-30 s. In contrast to vasopressin, glucagon did not stimulate Mn2+ influx into hepatocytes, but produced both a 3-fold enhancement of the rate of vasopressin-stimulated Mn2+ entry and the abolishment of the latency period. The effects of glucagon were mimicked by forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with pertussis toxin or depolarization of the cells altered neither the basal rate of Mn2+ entry nor the ability of vasopressin to stimulate this rate. Emptying of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ store by treatment with 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBuBHQ) did not enhance Mn2+ entry into hepatocytes; however, exposure of the cells to tBuBHQ for 2 min markedly enhanced the ability of vasopressin, alone or in combination with glucagon, to increase the rate of Mn2+ influx. Furthermore, pretreatment with tBuBHQ for 2 min abolished the latency of vasopressin-stimulated Mn2+ influx. It is concluded that Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones stimulate Ca2+ influx in hepatocytes, possibly through receptor-operated Ca2+ channels. The stimulation of divalent cation entry is transduced by a G protein, and the rate of influx appears to be controlled both by the intracellular level of cAMP and the empty state of an intracellular Ca2+ pool that may be inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-insensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1544370487,"Cleavage of a defined linear duplex DNA by vaccinia virus DNA topoisomerase I was found to occur nonrandomly and infrequently. Approximately 12 sites of strand scission were detected within the 5372 nucleotides of pUC19 DNA. These sites could be classified as having higher or lower affinity for topoisomerase based on the following criteria. Higher affinity sites were cleaved at low enzyme concentration, were less sensitive to competition, and were most refractory to religation promoted by salt, divalent cations, and elevated temperature. Cleavage at lower affinity sites required higher enzyme concentration and was more sensitive to competition and induced religation. Cleavage site selection correlated with a pentameric sequence motif (C/T)CCTT immediately preceding the site of strand scission. Noncovalent DNA binding by topoisomerase predominated over covalent adduct formation, as revealed by nitrocellulose filter-binding studies. The noncovalent binding affinity of vaccinia topoisomerase for particular subsegments of pUC19 DNA correlated with the strength and/or the number of DNA cleavage sites contained therein. Thus, cleavage site selection is likely to be dictated by specific noncovalent DNA-protein interactions. This was supported by the demonstration that a mutant vaccinia topoisomerase (containing a Tyr—-Phe substitution at the active site) that was catalytically inert and did not form the covalent intermediate, nevertheless bound DNA with similar affinity and site selectivity as the wild-type enzyme. Noncovalent binding is therefore independent of competence in transesterification. It is construed that the vaccinia topoisomerase is considerably more stringent in its cleavage and binding specificity for duplex DNA than are the cellular type I enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1533480923,"D-myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) regulates intracellular Ca2+ by mobilizing Ca2+ from a non-mitochondrial store. We have investigated the effects of Ca2+ on the binding of [32P]Ins (1,4,5)P3 to permeabilized rat hepatocytes and a liver plasma membrane-enriched fraction. Increasing the free Ca2+ concentration in the medium from 0.1 nM to 0.7 microM increased the capacity of a high affinity binding component (KD = 2-3 nM) in permeabilized cells by a factor of 10. If the membrane fraction was preincubated at 37 degrees C before binding was measured at 4 degrees C, all of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors were transformed to a low affinity state (KD = 65 +/- 12 nM, Bmax = 3.1 +/- 0.1 fmol/mg, n = 4). When 0.7 microM of Ca2+ was added, the receptors were totally transformed to a high affinity state (KD = 2.8 +/- 0.4 nM, Bmax = 2.7 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg, n = 4). The EC50 of the Ca2(+)-induced interconversion of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor was 140 nM. This Ca2(+)-induced transformation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor from a low affinity to a high affinity state was associated with an inhibition of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized hepatocytes. These data suggest that the Ins(1,4,5)P3-dependent hormones, by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, induce a reversible transformation of the receptor from its low affinity state, coupled to the Ca2+ release, to a desensitized high affinity state. Transformation of the receptor may play a role in the oscillatory release of Ca2+ observed in single isolated hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1607412327,"A human erythrocyte cytosolic phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP kinase) and a membrane-bound PIP kinase have been purified by phosphocellulose chromatography. Fractionation of the membrane-bound PIP kinase activities by phosphocellulose separated activity into two peaks, which eluted at 0.6 M NaCl (type I PIP kinase) and 1.0 M NaCl (type II PIP kinase). The cytosolic PIP kinase and the membrane-bound type II PIP kinase are 53 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, have indistinguishable 125I-peptide maps, and are immunochemically indistinguishable, suggesting that they are sequence identical. Antibodies raised to the cytosolic PIP kinase inhibit activity of both the membrane-bound type II and the cytosolic PIP kinases. The type I PIP kinase appears to be distinct from the cytosolic and membrane-bound type II PIP kinase; it is not immunocross-reactive, and antibodies toward type II PIP kinases do not inhibit type I PIP kinase. Further, membrane-bound type II PIP kinase can be removed from type I PIP kinase without loss of activity. Functional characterization of the PIP kinases demonstrates that the type I kinase has a 10-fold lower Km for PIP and a 5-fold higher Km for ATP compared with the type II enzymes. The type I and type II (membrane-bound or cytosolic) PIP kinases are modulated differentially by spermine and heparin. Finally, the type I PIP kinase phosphorylates intrinsic PIP on isolated erythrocyte membranes, whereas the type II PIP kinases have no activity toward native membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1532235425,"The rat insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptor develops transmembrane signaling functions by directly coupling to a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) having a 40-kDa alpha subunit, Gi-2, whereas recent studies have indicated that the IGF-II receptor is a molecule identical to the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), a receptor implicated in lysosomal enzyme sorting. In this study, by using vesicles reconstituted with the clonal human CI-MPR and G proteins, we indicated that the CI-MPR could stimulate guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) binding and GTPase activities of Gi proteins in response to IGF-II. The stimulatory effect of IGF-II on Gi-2 depended on the reconstituted amount of the CI-MPR; it could not be found in vesicles reconstituted with Gi-2 alone; and it was also observed on Gi-1 reconstituted with the CI-MPR in phospholipid vesicles. Of interest, such stimulatory effect was not reproduced by Man-6-P in CI-MPR vesicles reconstituted with either G protein. Furthermore, the affinity for Man-6-P-mediated beta-glucuronidase binding to several kinds of native cell membranes was not reduced by 100 microM GTP gamma S. Instead, however, Man-6-P dose-dependently inhibited IGF-II-induced Gi-2 activation with an IC50 of 6 microM in vesicles reconstituted with the CI-MPR and Gi-2. The action of 100 nM IGF-II was completely abolished by 1 mM Man-6-P. Such an inhibitory effect of Man-6-P was reproduced by 4000 times lower concentrations of beta-glucuronidase or similar concentrations of fructose 1-phosphate, but not by mannose or glucose 6-phosphate. These results indicate that the human CI-MPR has two distinct signaling functions that positively or negatively regulate the activity of Gi-2 in response to the binding of IGF-II or Man-6-P."
https://openalex.org/W1581490322,"We have developed a simple immunoaffinity chromatography procedure for the purification of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) from bovine serum. The enzyme was initially purified by a procedure consisting of 9% polyethylene glycol precipitation, Q Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography, S-300 gel filtration, wheat germ lectin-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite agarose, zinc chelate matrix, Mono Q-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and Superose 12 (gel filtration) HPLC. Using this purified material as immunogen, we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies. A low affinity antibody was selected for the purification of catalytically active GPI-PLD from bovine serum by immunoaffinity chromatography, followed by wheat germ lectin-Sepharose and Mono Q-fast protein liquid chromatography. The latter method provides a simple purification procedure with an overall yield of 26%. The purified enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of about 100,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a pI of about 5.6 by isoelectric focusing gel analysis. On Superose 12 HPLC, the material purified by the latter method elutes as a single peak with an apparent molecular weight of 200,000 as determined by protein standards. The enzyme activity is inhibited by [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid or 1,10-phenanthroline. Phosphatidic acid is the only 3H-labeled product when [3H]myristate-labeled variant surface glycoprotein is hydrolyzed by the purified enzyme. Amino terminal sequence analysis of the intact 100-kDa protein reveals no strong homology to that of any other known protein. Twelve tryptic peptides derived from the intact protein have been subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. Two of them share sequence homology with each other and with the metal ion binding domains of members of the integrin family. Based upon these criteria, it appears that the purified enzyme is distinct from other phospholipases with specificity for inositol phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1541971708,"Abstract Purified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) from rat liver was used for a quantitative analysis of the protein-DNA interaction at specific GR-binding segments within the 5'-long terminal repeat of the mouse mammary tumor virus. A truncated receptor was generated and used to demonstrate formation of heterodimeric GR, which furthermore was shown to be in rapid equilibrium with receptor-monomer. The relative affinity for GR binding to specific GR sites versus random calf thymus DNA was approximately 2 x 10(3). At equilibrium a free GR concentration of 3 x 10(-10) M was required for half-maximal saturation of the two functionally important DNA sites within the mouse mammary tumor virus 5'-long terminal repeat. Although these two DNA segments act synergistically in mediating hormonal response, we did not detect cooperative GR binding to these regions in vitro. However, GR bound cooperatively within the downstream binding region. Similarly, GR was unable to facilitate factor binding to a neighboring nuclear factor 1 site, another essential element in the promoter. In contrast, nuclear factor 1 binding was inhibited slightly by GR."
https://openalex.org/W1589615575,"The reaction of xanthine and xanthine oxidase generates superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. In contrast to earlier works, recent spin trapping data (Kuppusamy, P., and Zweier, J.L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9880-9884) suggested that hydroxyl radical may also be a product of this reaction. Determining if hydroxyl radical results directly from the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction is important for 1) interpreting experimental data in which this reaction is used as a model of oxidant stress, and 2) understanding the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Consequently, we evaluated the conditions required for hydroxyl radical generation during the oxidation of xanthine by xanthine oxidase. Following the addition of some, but not all, commercial preparations of xanthine oxidase to a mixture of xanthine, deferoxamine, and either 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide or a combination of alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl-nitrone and dimethyl sulfoxide, hydroxyl radical-derived spin adducts were detected. With other preparations, no evidence of hydroxyl radical formation was noted. Xanthine oxidase preparations that generated hydroxyl radical had greater associated with them, suggesting that adventitious was a possible contributing factor. Consistent with this hypothesis, addition of H2O2, in the absence of xanthine, to iron xanthine oxidase preparations generated hydroxyl radical. Substitution of a different chelator, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid for deferoxamine, or preincubation of high xanthine oxidase preparations with chelating resin, or overnight dialysis of the enzyme against deferoxamine decreased or eliminated hydroxyl radical generation without altering the rate of superoxide production. Therefore, hydroxyl radical does not appear to be a product of the oxidation of xanthine by xanthine oxidase. However, commercial xanthine oxidase preparations may contain adventitious bound to the enzyme, which can catalyze hydroxyl radical formation from hydrogen peroxide."
https://openalex.org/W1512554485,"Two methods are described for directing the expression of genes to the livers of animals using retroviral vectors containing the predominantly liver-specific promoter from the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-linked to the structural gene for either amino 3'-glycosyl phosphotransferase (neo) or bovine growth hormone (bGH). Replication-incompetent retrovirus was used to infect the livers of fetal rats by intraperitoneal injection of animals in utero or to infect adult rats by direct injection into the portal vein after partial hepatectomy. The proviruses were integrated into the hepatic DNA, and the chimeric genes were expressed from the PEPCK promoter for as long as 8 months after infection. The expression of the PEPCK-bGH gene was regulated by diet and hormones in a manner similar to the regulation of the endogenous PEPCK gene in the liver. The potential of this method for targeting genes to the liver is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1515566625,"The origin binding protein (OBP) or herpes simplex virus 1 has been expressed in Escherichia coli and used to study the role of multiple OBP binding sites in the herpes simplex virus #1 origin of replication, oris. Our results showed that the sequence CGTTCGCACTT was required for the binding of OBP to duplex DNA with high affinity. The minimal oris contains three repeats of this sequence or close derivatives thereof. Filter binding experiments have demonstrated that specific binding occurs to two of these repeats, box I and box II. An investigation using the DNase I footprinting technique revealed that the binding of OBP to box I and box II was cooperative and led to the formation of a highly organized complex in which the entire oris sequence was induced. We observed furthermore that the AT-rich sequence of the oris dyad was readily accessible to macromolecules even in the OBP.oris complex. The DNase I cleavage pattern of this sequence was, however, altered radically, indicating that a significant conformational change had occurred. A tentative structural model for the OBP-oris interaction is discussed on the basis of these observations."
https://openalex.org/W1499826012,"Fully functional chimeric receptors, consisting of major epidermal growth factor and insulin receptor domains, were co-expressed with kinase-negative epidermal growth factor and insulin receptor mutants in human kidney fibroblasts. Under these conditions, homologous extracellular and cytoplasmic domains mediated association of receptors and their precursors. The significance of receptor-receptor interaction was confirmed by transphosphorylation of kinase-negative receptors by ligand-activated chimeric receptors, which was observed between receptors sharing the same cytoplasmic domain as well as between receptors bearing only the same extracellular domain and containing heterologous kinases. Furthermore, the impaired ligand internalization capacity of a kinase-deficient insulin receptor was partially restored by transphosphorylation. Our experiments suggest interreceptor transphosphorylation and transactivation as a possible mechanism for signal amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1498177570,"Treatment of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid, NG108-15, cells with prostaglandin E1, which in these cells activates adenylate cyclase, produced a marked (50%) reduction in immunologically detectable levels of Gs alpha associated with the plasma membrane. This effect was dependent both on the time of treatment and on the concentration of the receptor ligand used and did not involve a translocation of Gs alpha from the membrane to the cytoplasm of the cells. Both the 45- and 42-kDa forms of Gs alpha which are expressed by these cells were reduced in levels by treatment with the agonist but the greater effect was on the more prevalent 45-kDa polypeptide. By contrast, treatment of the cells with forskolin over the same period did not produce a reduction in levels of Gs alpha, indicating that the effect of prostaglandin E1 was independent of cAMP production. Prostaglandin E1-mediated down-regulation of Gs alpha levels was not produced at the transcriptional level as amounts of mRNA encoding Gs alpha were not reduced by treatment of the cells with agonist. Further, treatment of NG108-15 cells with cycloheximide, throughout the time period required to produce maximal prostaglandin E1-dependent down-regulation of Gs alpha, demonstrated that complete suppression of de novo protein synthesis could not mimic the effect of prostaglandin E1 and hence even complete inhibition of transcription of the Gs alpha gene and/or translation of pre-existing mRNA could not account for these results. Prostaglandin E1 treatment of the cells had no effect on steady-state levels of the alpha subunits of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins, Gi2, Gi3, Go, which are expressed by these cells or on the level of G-protein beta subunit. Fluoride stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in membranes of S49 cyc- cells following addition of sodium cholate extracts of membranes of prostaglandin E1-treated NG108-15 cells was only some 50% as effective as with equivalent extracts from untreated cells. These results provide evidence for a novel mechanism of receptor-mediated control of the stimulation of adenylate cyclase, involving reduction in the steady-state amounts of Gs alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1601701782,"This report demonstrates that the high affinity binding of ankyrin to two well characterized ankyrin-binding proteins, the erythrocyte anion exchanger and kidney Na+K(+)-ATPase, requires interaction of these proteins with unique sites on the ankyrin molecule. Binding of 125I-labeled erythrocyte ankyrin and ankyrin proteolytic domains was measured to the anion exchanger and Na+K(+)-ATPase incorporated into phosphatidylcholine liposomes. 125I-Labeled ankyrin associated with both anion exchanger and Na+K(+)-ATPase liposomes with a high affinity (KD ranging from 10 to 25 nM), and a capacity approaching 1 mol of ankyrin/2 mol of ATPase and 1 mol of ankyrin/8 mol of anion exchanger. The 43 kDa cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte anion exchanger inhibited binding of ankyrin to both the anion exchanger and Na+K(+)-ATPase liposomes with a 50% reduction at approximately 90 nM for both proteins. Further binding experiments using proteolytic domains derived from ankyrin demonstrated the following differences between the anion exchanger and Na+K(+)-ATPase in interactions with ankyrin: 1) 125I-Labeled Na+K(+)-ATPase associated with both the 89-kDa domain as well as the spectrin binding domain of ankyrin, while the anion exchanger only associated with the 89-kDa domain. 2) The 125I-labeled 89-kDa domain of ankyrin associated with Na+K(+)-ATPase liposomes with at least a 20-fold lower affinity compared with intact ankyrin while this domain associated with the anion exchanger with a 2-3-fold increase in affinity compared with intact ankyrin. 3) The 125I-labeled spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin associated with the Na+K(+)-ATPase liposomes to at least an 8-fold greater extent than to anion exchanger liposomes. The data are consistent with an independent acquisition of high affinity ankyrin binding activity for the anion exchanger and Na+K(+)-ATPase proteins through a convergent evolutionary process."
https://openalex.org/W1483808523,"Apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) is a constituent of low density lipoproteins that has been implicated in the development of coronary artery disease (Editorial (1988) Lancet 1, 1141-1142). It is produced primarily in the liver, but mechanisms of secretory control are unclear. We examined the possibility that rapid reuptake of newly secreted lipoproteins regulates the net output of apoB by cultured liver cells. Polyclonal blocking antibodies to the low density lipoprotein receptor markedly increased apoB output, and varying the width of the unstirred water layer around the cells also changed apoB output, consistent with local reuptake. Labeled apoB added to the bulk fluid phase of the incubation media was not detectably taken up, implying that re-uptake is predominantly local. We conclude that a major site of apoB secretory control resides in the unstirred water layer, external to the cell. Because many cells secrete products for which they possess receptors, local re-uptake from the unstirred water layer may be a general mechanism for secretory control."
https://openalex.org/W1679273654,"A recombinant full length human glucocorticoid receptor stimulates transcription in vitro of test genes containing synthetic glucocorticoid and progesterone response elements or murine mammary tumor virus promoter. The receptor expressed in a baculoviral vector is highly active, enhancing transcription of hormone response genes greater than 30-fold even at a receptor concentration of 1.2 nM. The enhancement of transcription is glucocorticoid and progesterone response element-dependent, suggesting that it is a receptor mediated event. In vitro and in vivo treatment with the agonist dexamethasone or with the antagonist Ru486 did not alter significantly the functional activity of partially purified receptor. Kinetic studies suggest that both glucocorticoid receptor and HeLa cell extracts are required for formation of a stable committed transcriptional complex. Our results indicate that the action of glucocorticoid receptor on gene transcription is similar to that defined recently for the progesterone receptor and may be a general mechanism for all steroid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1497849810,"Purified carbohydrate-binding protein 35 (CBP35) and extracts of mouse cells containing CBP35 were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Such an analysis on recombinant CBP35, obtained by expression of a cDNA clone in Escherichia coli, yielded a pI value of 8.7. When extracts of mouse 3T3 cells were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, two spots were observed, corresponding to pI values of 8.7 and 8.2. The pI 8.2 species represents post-translational modification of the CBP35 polypeptide (pI 8.7) by the addition of a single phosphate group. This conclusion is based on the finding that purified CBP35 contained a pI 8.2 species that was labeled with 32PO4 and could be converted to the unlabeled pI 8.7 species by alkaline phosphatase treatment. The phosphorylated (pI 8.2) form of CBP35 is found in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, whereas the unphosphorylated (pI 8.7) species is found exclusively in the nuclei. Quiescent populations of 3T3 fibroblasts (confluent monolayers or serum-starved sparse cultures) are characterized by the predominance of phosphorylated CBP35. Stimulation of the same cells into the proliferative state resulted in an increase in the amount of the phosphorylated species; more dramatic, however, is the elevation of the level of the unphosphorylated form, which is barely detectable in quiescent cells."
https://openalex.org/W1508862061,"The main role of the ovarian granulosa cells is to nurse the oocyte and to produce estradiol and progesterone upon stimulation by gonadotropins. In fact, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone control the expression of several genes during granulosa cell differentiation via cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylations. Cyclic AMP stimulates transcription of genes that carry the cAMP-responsive element (CRE,5'TGACGTCA3') in their promoters. The fibronectin (FN) gene contains one CRE sequence at position -170. However, gonadotropins and cAMP inhibit FN gene expression in granulosa cells. To study the mechanism of the inhibition we developed a bovine granulosa cell line (BGC-1) that synthesizes estradiol in response to FSH and in which FSH and dibutyryl cAMP specifically decrease FN synthesis and its mRNA levels. The inhibitory effect (a) is not due to an alteration in FN mRNA stability, (b) requires upstream sequences other than CRE, located between positions -510 and -223, that are able to bind granulosa cell nuclear proteins, (c) is entirely dependent on the synthesis of intermediate proteins induced and or phosphorylated by cAMP, and (d) effectively suppresses the CRE-dependent transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W1484560547,"RecA protein aligns homologous single- and double-stranded DNA molecules in three-stranded joints that can extend over thousands of base pairs. When cross-linked by 4‘-amino-4,5‘,8-trimethyl-psoralen the joint structure observed in nonuniform and divided into multiple substructures each a few hundred base pairs long. Two paired substructures are observed; at least one, and possibly both, are right-handed triple helices. Sites of homologous contact are interspersed with regions where the DNA molecules are arranged side-by-side without contact. These substructures alternate in all combinations. The length and frequency of joints is much greater when one of the DNA substrates is linear, and interwinding is unrestricted, than when there are topological restrictions between the pairing partners. The results are consistent with the idea that recA protein facilitates the formation of a right-handed triple-helical DNA pairing intermediate during strand exchange. The results further suggest that recA filaments do not promote the formation of structures that provide efficient topological compensation for right-handed interwinding of two paired DNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1484415245,"The superoxide-generating respiratory burst oxidase (NADPH oxidase) from human neutrophils can be activated in a cell-free system consisting of plasma membranes, cytosol, and an anionic amphiphile such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or arachidonate, and guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP(gamma)S) augments activation. We report herein that short-chain diacylglycerols (e.g. dioctanoylglycerol (diC8)) synergize with SDS in the activation of superoxide generation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, resulting in rates up to 1400 nmol/min/mg plasma membrane protein, or 250-700% higher than the rate seen with SDS alone. diC8 did not affect significantly the dose response for either cytosol or SDS, indicating that the activation was not due to increased sensitivity of the oxidase toward either of these components. At optimal concentrations of SDS and diC8, additional activation was observed in the presence of GTP(gamma)S, indicating that diC8 and GTP activate by separate mechanisms. In contrast to diC8, other known activators of protein kinase C (phorbol myristate acetate and mezerein) augmented SDS activation only minimally (typically 20-30%), and neither diacylglycerols nor tumor promoters activated in the absence of SDS. Activation by diC8 was calcium and phosphatidylserine independent, and the specificity for neutral lipids was atypical for protein kinase C. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (staurosporine and a peptide substrate analog) also failed to inhibit the response. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of several neutrophil proteins including p47phox was seen with both SDS and diC8, and synergistic phosphorylation of p47phox was seen when both activating factors were present. Thus, diacylglycerol synergizes with SDS in activating both superoxide generation and p47phox phosphorylation in the cell-free activation system, but the activation is atypical of a protein kinase C mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1566554479,"Most DNA-dependent DNA polymerases exist as a complex with one or more noncovalently bound accessory proteins, whose presence is necessary for the correct functioning of the holoenzyme. Using the herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase as a representative member of the alpha-polymerase family, we have recreated the association between the polymerase and its accessory protein UL42 in vitro through the translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate of bacteriophage RNA polymerase-generated transcripts encoding the two polypeptides. Study of the ability of deleted versions of the polymerase protein to bind UL42, as detected by coimmunoprecipitation of the two polypeptides, defined a carboxyl-terminal region of the DNA polymerase that was both necessary and sufficient for the association. This domain is distinct from regions of the protein previously characterized as involved in catalysis. The results suggest a strategy for the design of novel targeted antiviral drugs, which would disrupt the DNA polymerase-UL42 complex."

The amounts of the Na,K-ATPase alpha and beta subunits, determined by Western blot, increase coordinately to greater than 2-fold over control by 24 h in low K+ and remained elevated for the duration of the study period (48 h). Na,K-ATPase activity, measured enzymatically, increased 1.4-fold by 24 h and remained elevated. In order to determine if this response was initiated pretranslationally, alpha and beta subunit mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis. While there was no change in alpha-mRNA levels, beta levels increased significantly, to 1.9-fold over control by 6 h of treatment and remained elevated. This selective increase in beta-mRNA was accompanied by 1.6- and 3.1-fold increases in the respective rates of accumulation of newly synthesized alpha and beta subunits, assessed by immunoprecipitating subunits from pulse-labeled cells. The degradation rates of mature Na,K-ATPase subunits did not change during 16 h of exposure to low K+, but after 16 h there was a selective decrease in the alpha degradation rate, relative to control. These results suggest that increased pretranslational regulation of the beta subunit alone is sufficient to increase accumulation of both alpha and beta subunits. These findings support the notion that in LLC-PK1 cells newly synthesized beta is rate-limiting and thus regulates, through alpha beta assembly, the number of pumps transported to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1538745462,"We have characterized the activities of the cytochrome bc1 complex in mitochondrial membranes from a yeast strain in which we deleted the nuclear gene (QCR6, COR3) which codes for the highly acidic subunit 6 of the bc1 complex. The chromosomal copy of QCR6 was replaced with a plasmid derived copy of QCR6, in which the entire coding region of QCR6 was replaced with the yeast LEU2 gene. The resulting deletion strain, MES8, contained no detectable mRNA for QCR6, and the cytochrome bc1 complex purified from the deletion strain lacked subunit 6. The deletion strain respired and grew on nonfermentable carbon sources such as ethanol and glycerol. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity of mitochondria from the deletion strain was decreased 50% under conditions where the activity is zero order with respect to cytochrome c, and there was a similar decrease in the first-order rate constant for cytochrome c reduction. The loss of bc1 complex activities, observed at physiological ionic strengths, was reversible. Both the zero order rate and the first-order rate constant for cytochrome c reduction could be recovered to those of the parental strain by measuring these activities in mitochondrial membranes under conditions of low ionic strength. The zero order rate and first-order rate constant for cytochrome c reduction in membranes from the parent, wild-type yeast showed essentially no change coincident with this change in ionic strength. The 50% drop in both turnover number and first-order rate constant of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity indicates that half of the cytochrome bc1 complexes are inactive in the deletion strain at physiological ionic strengths. Inhibition by myxothiazol of cytochrome c reductase activity of mitochondrial membranes from the deletion strain showed an ionic strength-dependent lag in the titration curve that extended to the point where half of the inhibitor sites are filled. This lag was not observed with membranes from the wild-type, parent strain. This response to the inhibitor is consistent with half of the cytochrome bc1 complexes being inactive in mitochondria from the deletion strain at physiological ionic strength, but with both active and inactive complexes still able to bind inhibitor. The reversible, half-of-the-sites reactivity indicates that the bc1 complex must be dimeric in situ, in agreement with previous findings that the complexes isolated from fungal (Leonard, K., Wingfield, P., Arad, T., and Weiss, H. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 149, 259-274) and mammalian (Nalecz, M. J., Bolli, R., and Azzi, A. (1985) Arch. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W1529383919,"The types of inositol phosphates (InsPs) formed in response to activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes were determined in collagenase-dispersed renal cells and hepatocytes by high pressure liquid chromatography separation. In hepatocytes, which contain only the alpha 1b subtype, norepinephrine stimulated rapid (10-s) formation of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 and slower (5-min) formation of Ins(1,4)P2 and Ins(1)P. Selective inactivation of alpha 1b receptors by chloroethylclonidine almost completely blocked the effects of norepinephrine in hepatocytes. In renal cells, which contain both alpha 1a and alpha 1b receptors in a 60:40 ratio, norepinephrine did not significantly increase the size of any peaks until 5 min after agonist activation. At this time, only a peak eluting with Ins(1)P and one eluting shortly after Ins(1,4)P2 were significantly elevated. Incubation with norepinephrine for 2 h caused small but significant increases in peaks co-eluting with Ins(1)P and Ins(1,4,5)P3 in renal cells; however, only the increase in Ins(1)P was inhibited by chloroethylclonidine pretreatment. Extraction under neutral conditions suggested that cyclic InsPs may be the primary compounds formed in response to norepinephrine in renal cells. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ caused a 60% reduction in the InsP response to norepinephrine in renal cells but had no effect in hepatocytes. These results suggest that activation of alpha 1a and alpha 1b receptor subtypes results in formation of different InsPs and that the response to alpha 1a activation may require influx of extracellular Ca2+."

The extent of phosphorylation obtained was 5.65 mol of phosphate/mol of caldesmon. Phosphorylated protein was subjected to the complete trypsin proteolysis and the produced phosphopeptides were purified by C-8 reverse phase chromatography. Nine phosphopeptides were isolated and by amino acid sequence analysis, eight phosphorylation sites were identified. According to the published amino acid sequence of chicken gizzard caldesmon (Bryan, J., Imai, M., Lee, R., Moore, P., Cook, R. G., and Lin, W.-G. (1989) J. Biol.

The time course of phosphorylation of these sites was also measured and it was concluded that the first site was serine 73, the second site was serine 26, the third site was serine 726, and the fourth site was serine 587. The preferred phosphorylation sites were located in the amino terminus myosin binding domain whereas slower phosphorylation occurred in the carboxyl terminus actin/calmodulin domain."
https://openalex.org/W1492180015,"During transcription, positive and negative superhelical stresses are generated on a DNA template which could potentially affect nucleosomal structure. When transcription was performed on a closed circular plasmid containing nucleosomes, using T7 RNA polymerase and topoisomerase I, nucleosomal structure was lost from the DNA. Nucleosome content was assayed by analyzing both the topological state of the DNA and the nuclease-resistant fragments produced by micrococcal nuclease and DNase I treatment. This nucleosome dissolution required positive superhelical stress as evidenced by the requirement that the extended RNA transcript remain associated with the polymerase during the transcription process. Rates of transcription were found to be independent of whether the nucleosomes dissolved. When transcription was performed in the absence of topoisomerase I, nucleosome reformation occurred very rapidly. This observation suggests that negative superhelical stress, induced in the wake of polymerase action, facilitates nucleosome reformation."
https://openalex.org/W1515639871,"Cultured fibroblasts (REF52 cells) were employed to investigate phospholipid degradation in response to vasopressin (VP) treatment. There have been few studies in fibroblasts which characterize the pattern and relationship of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and non-phosphoinositide hydrolysis elicited by VP. Here we demonstrate that VP-induced PIP2 hydrolysis is closely accompanied by phosphatidylcholine (PC) degradation by phospholipase D. Cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid showed rapid formation and diminution of [3H]diacylglycerol (DG) (5-15s) when treated with VP; this was accompanied by a reduction in polyphosphoinositide radioactivity. Radiolabeled inositol trisphosphate was generated with a similar time frame. In cells prelabeled with [3H]myristic acid, which is predominantly incorporated into cellular PC, VP elicited the generation of [3H]myristoyl phosphatidate (PA) as early as 15 s, in the absence of an increase in labeled DG. In the presence of ethanol the pattern of [3H]myristoyl phosphatidylethanol (PEt) formation coincided with [3H]myristoyl-PA formation in the absence of ethanol. PEt was similarly formed, in response to VP treatment, in cells prelabeled with 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. The formation of PC-derived [3H]myristoyl-DG was characterized by a lag period of approximately 1 min, after which DG increased steadily over a 10-min period. Biphasic formation of DG was observed in cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid, and the formation of [3H]PA occurred in an uninterrupted fashion. Two protein kinase C agonists, phorbol diester and dioctanoylglycerol, elicited the formation of [3H]myristoyl-PEt. The inclusion of staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, blocked VP-induced [3H]myristoyl-PEt formation by 88%. These data demonstrate that VP elicits the coordinated hydrolysis of PIP2 by phospholipase C and PC hydrolysis by phospholipase D. This event results in the prolonged generation of PA and biphasic formation of DG. From the time courses shown, we hypothesize that the early generation of PA, heretofore ascribed to products of the polyphosphoinositide cycle, are in part derived from PC by phospholipase D."
https://openalex.org/W1611023918,"Na+/H+ exchange activation by growth factors is proposed to be an important early signal for mitogenesis; however, little is known of its duration and requirement during later stages of the cell cycle. Macrophage-specific colony factor (CSF-1) rapidly activates murine bone marrow-derived macrophage Na+/H+ exchange, resulting in stimulation of Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity. The response to CSF-1 is maintained for at least 24 h. Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange with 5-N,N-dimethylamiloride prevents CSF-1-stimulated DNA synthesis and cell growth. This is unlikely to be due to cytoplasmic acidosis, but more likely reflects a requirement for Na+/H+ exchange-mediated Na+ influx. DMA addition even up to 8 h after the growth factors suppresses S-phase progression. Na+/H+ exchange appears not to be involved in the induction of other early growth factor responses (c-fos and c-myc mRNA induction and general RNA and protein synthesis). We propose that growth factor-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange late in G1 of the cell cycle is required for S-phase progression but not for certain early growth factor responses."
https://openalex.org/W1517013856,"Abstract An elongated beta-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase was found in fibroblast strains derived from two patients with juvenile Sandhoff disease and two asymptomatic individuals sharing an unusual isoenzyme pattern: a low level of residual A (alpha beta) isoenzyme activity (3-6% of normal for the juvenile Sandhoff and 9-10% for the asymptomatic strains) without B (beta beta) isoenzyme activity. The elongated beta-subunit was abnormal in other ways: It reacted with antiserum against the unfolded polypeptide, it was not phosphorylated on mannose residues, it was not processed to the mature form, and it was degraded rapidly. The increased length of the beta-subunit was caused by two different mutations. Cells from two juvenile Sandhoff and one asymptomatic individuals had the previously described G----A transition in intron 12 that creates a splice site, causing an in-frame insertion of 24 intronic nucleotides into mRNA (Nakano, T., and Suzuki, K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5155-5158). The second mutation was found in cells from the asymptomatic girl whose A+B- isoenzyme pattern had been designated Hexosaminidase Paris (Dreyfus, J. C., Poenaru, L., Vibert, M., Ravise, N., and Boue, J. (1977) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 29, 287-293); duplication of a region straddling the junction of intron 13 and exon 14 generates an alternate splice site, causing an in-frame insertion of 18 nucleotides into mRNA. Although the two new splice sites are used preferentially, the normal sites may be used to some extent, accounting for the residual A isoenzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1536231611,"We have prepared by semisynthetic methods a two-chain insulin/insulin-like growth factor I hybrid that contains a synthetic peptide related to residues 22-41 of insulin-like growth factor I linked via peptide bond to ArgB22 of des-octapeptide-(B23-B30)-insulin and have applied the analog to the analysis of ligand interactions with the type I insulin-like growth factor and insulin receptors of placental plasma membranes. Relative potencies for the inhibition of 125I-labeled insulin-like growth factor I binding to type I insulin-like growth factor receptors were 1.0:0.20:0.003 for insulin-like growth factor I, the hybrid analog, and insulin, respectively. Corresponding relative potencies for the inhibition of 125I-labeled insulin binding to insulin receptors were 0.007:0.28:1 for the three respective peptides. Additional studies identified that the hybrid analog interacts with only one of two populations of insulin-like growth factor I binding sites on placental plasma membranes and permitted the analysis of insulin-like growth factor I interactions with the separate populations of binding sites. We conclude that (a) des-octapeptide-(B23-B30)-insulin can serve well as a scaffold to support structural elements of insulin-like growth factor I and insulin necessary for high affinity binding to their receptors, (b) major aspects of structure relevant to the conferral of receptor binding affinity lie in the COOH-terminal region of the insulin B chain and in the COOH-terminal region of the insulin-like growth factor I B domain and in its C domain, and (c) the evolution of ligand-receptor specificity in these systems has relied as much on restricting interactions (through the selective introduction of negative structural elements) as it has on enhancing interactions (through the introduction of affinity conferring elements of structure)."
https://openalex.org/W1593050089,"It is shown by the use of EPR spectroscopy that formation of the hydroxyl radical adduct with the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) in the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system is hydrogen peroxide-independent. Production of the DMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct is inhibited by superoxide dismutase but is unaffected by purified grades of catalase. Hydroxyl radicals are a secondary product of the decomposition of the DMPO-superoxide radical adduct and are also formed as a result of trace metals such as iron present in the buffer. These results are in contrast with a recent report (Kuppusamy, P., and Zweier, J. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9880-9884) in which the assertion is made that the hydroxyl radical adduct arises from the trapping of hydroxyl radicals generated via the direct reduction of hydrogen peroxide by xanthine oxidase. It is demonstrated here that treatment of phosphate buffer with the chelator deferoxamine mesylate is not in itself sufficient to suppress the effect of contaminating adventitious metal ions in xanthine-xanthine oxidase incubations."
https://openalex.org/W1512974202,"The bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor was solubilized from Swiss mouse 3T3 cell membranes in an active form and was purified about 90,000-fold to near homogeneity by a combination of wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and ligand affinity chromatography. The purified receptor displayed a single diffuse band with a Mr of 75,000-100,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After treatment of the receptor with N-glycanase, removing N-linked oligosaccharide moieties, the protein yielded a Mr = 38,000 band. These results agree with the Mr value estimated for the GRP receptor that was labeled on Swiss 3T3 cells by cross-linking to 125I-GRP1-27. GRP1-27 bound to the purified receptor with a Kd of 0.038 +/- 0.019 nM. By comparison, the soluble receptor in unfractionated extracts and intact membranes displayed a Kd for GRP1-27 of 0.036 +/- 0.003 nM and 0.13 +/- 0.04 nM, respectively. The relative potencies of a series of GRP analogs for the soluble receptor and intact membranes indicated that the extraction procedure did not significantly alter the receptor's ligand binding specificity. However coupling of the receptor to its guanyl nucleotide regulatory protein was not maintained in the soluble extract, and a G-protein did not co-purify with the receptor. Physiological concentrations of NaCl greatly inhibited the binding of some GRP analogs to the receptor, while the binding of other analogs was not affected. A domain on the GRP molecule involving Lys-13 or Arg-17 was identified which promoted binding to the GRP receptor under conditions of low ionic strength. These findings aided the development of an effective ligand affinity resin for the purification of the GRP receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1532402086,"Prostaglandins (PGs) of the E series are recognized by specific receptors on T lymphocytes which lead to an increase in cAMP. The role of cAMP in modulation of T lymphocyte function is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that agents which increase cAMP in human T cells raise the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). This increase in [Ca2+]i occurred following receptor stimulation with PGEs or by bypassing the receptor with the cell-permeant analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP or forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase. The calcium response to a submaximally stimulatory concentration of PGE2 was potentiated by the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine. A time course of cAMP production in response to PGE2 stimulation closely resembled the calcium response and suggested that the two events were coincident. The PGE2 concentrations required to achieve 50% maximum effect of cAMP production and increases in [Ca2+]i were similar, 0.07 and 0.15 microM respectively. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ did not abolish the PGE2-stimulated Ca2+ response, suggesting that an intracellular source of calcium was sensitive to cAMP. Significant inositol phosphate production was not detected in response to PGE2 over a wide concentration range. The PGE2-induced calcium response curves were of lesser magnitude with shorter times to peak than those of a known inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate-producing agonist, anti-CD3, suggesting distinct Ca2+ release mechanisms. However, the cAMP-releasable store appeared to be contained within the inositol trisphosphate-releasable store since no response could be seen with cAMP-elevating agents following emptying of the inositol trisphosphate-sensitive pool of Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1597446389,"F9 embryonal mouse teratocarcinoma cells were differentiated to a primitive endoderm-like phenotype by retinoic acid and to a parietal endoderm-like phenotype by retinoic acid in combination with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The secretion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a characteristic of the cells displaying the differentiated phenotypes. The fundamental question of whether tPA secretion is regulated acutely by G-protein-mediated transmembrane signaling was explored. Cells differentiated to primitive and parietal endoderm demonstrated a rapid tPA response to stimulation by beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol). Adenylyl cyclase activity in response to isoproterenol and GTP, but not forskolin, was greater in primitive and parietal endoderm than F9 stem cells. Both primitive and parietal endoderm cells, but not F9 stem cells, displayed beta-adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation. Retinoic acid induced F9 stem cells to the primitive endoderm phenotype and increased beta-adrenergic receptor levels 3-fold. Gi alpha 2 levels declined, G beta-subunits increased, and Gs alpha levels were unchanged following differentiation to primitive endoderm. In parietal endoderm cells beta-adrenergic receptors increased 2-fold over F9 stem cells, Gi alpha 2 levels declined even further than in primitive endoderm, G beta-subunits increased compared to F9 stem cells, and Gs alpha levels again were unchanged. The marked potentiation of short-term stimulation of tPA secretion in the differentiated state may be best explained by the retinoic acid-induced increase in expression of beta-adrenergic receptors coupled with a decline in Gi alpha 2 levels. Short-term regulation by G-protein-linked receptors represents a novel mode for the control of tPA secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1575274357,"We have tried to identify iodinated thyroglobulin molecules in purified thyroid-coated vesicles to determined whether the internalization of the thyroid prohormone could proceed via a mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Coated vesicles isolated from pig thyroids by differential centrifugation and centrifugation on 2H2O-sucrose cushion were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and analyses of the polypeptide composition by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and Western blot using anti-clathrin heavy chain and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. Clathrin and thyroglobulin (Tg) appeared as the two major components of the purified thyroid coated vesicles (TCV). Purified TCV fraction was homogeneous when analyzed by isopycnic centrifugation on 30% Percoll gradient. TCV had an apparent buoyant density of 1.035 g/ml. The presence of Tg molecules inside TCV was ascertained by (a) immunogold labeling on cryosections of TCV pellet and (b) identification by gel electrophoresis and radio-immunoassay of a definite fraction of Tg (3-5% of total protein) in TCV treated by Triton X-100. The detergent-treated TCV also contained protein-bound iodine: 0.5-0.7 micrograms of iodine/mg protein. Pulse-chase experiments on in vitro reconstituted thyroid follicles have been used to further document the presence of iodinated Tg molecules in coated vesicles. TCV were isolated from reconstituted thyroid follicles previously labeled with [125I]iodide to radioiodinate Tg of the follicular lumen (the pre-endocytotic compartment) and incubated with or without thyrotropin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP to activate intraluminal 125I-Tg endocytosis. Autoradiographic analyses revealed the presence of 125I-Tg in purified TCV and Triton X-100-treated TCV. 125I-Tg present in TCV represented 1-2% of the total intracellular protein-bound radioactivity. Thyrotropin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased 2-3-fold the 125I-Tg content of TCV. Our results clearly show that iodinated Tg, the molecular form of the thyroid prohormone known to be internalized, is present into TCV. The data suggest that coated vesicles are involved in the uptake and transport of Tg from the follicular lumen to the lysosomal compartment and therefore, that the internalization of Tg could proceed, at least for a part, via a mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1608630683,"In an earlier study (Miwa, M., Hill, C., Kumar, R., Sugatani, J., Olson, M. S., and Hanahan, D. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 527-530) it was shown that an inhibitor of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a powerful endogenous mediator of platelet aggregation, was present in freeze-clamped perfused livers. Subsequently, we determined that this substance was a mixture of unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA). Among these FFA, oleic acid between 10 and 100 microM was found to be a potent inhibitor of PAF-induced platelet aggregation and serotonin secretion. Consequently, in order to understand the molecular mechanism of oleic acid action, we investigated the effects of this FFA on several biochemical events associated with platelet aggregation induced by PAF. The effect of oleic acid and/or PAF on the level of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was examined by using platelets labeled with [32P]phosphate. Oleic acid induced a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of [32P]PIP and [32P]PIP2; a maximal decrease in [32P]PIP and [32P]PIP2 of approximately 50 and 25%, respectively, was observed within seconds after the addition of 20 microM oleic acid and persisted for at least 15 min. Oleic acid did not induce the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates in platelets prelabeled with [3H]inositol, suggesting that the decrease in [32P]PIP and [32P]PIP2 was not due to a stimulation of phospholipase C. In contrast to oleic acid, PAF induced a dose-dependent increase in the [32P]PIP level, reaching a maximum of approximately 200% 3 min after the addition of 1 nM PAF to the platelets. This increase in [32P]PIP was accompanied by platelet aggregation and secretion, and a close correlation was established between the [32P]PIP level and the degree of aggregation. Oleic acid and PAF, when added together to the platelets, interacted by affecting the level of [32P]PIP and [32P]PIP2 in an opposite way since the decrease in the level of [32P]PIP and [32P] PIP2 induced by oleic acid was partially reversed by an excess of PAF. The decrease in the levels of [32P] PIP and [32P]PIP2 caused by oleic acid was associated with an inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by PAF. Interestingly, oleic acid did not block [3H]PAF binding to platelets but inhibited the PAF-induced phosphorylation of platelet proteins of 20 kDa and 40 kDa. These results suggest that inhibition of the PAF response by oleic acid may be at one of the steps in the signal transduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

All three agents decreased asbestos fiber uptake in a dose-response fashion, but no agent provided complete protection against fiber penetration. We conclude that uptake of amosite asbestos fibers is mediated in part by active oxygen species (most likely OH.), but that other mechanisms of fiber uptake must also exist."
https://openalex.org/W1556276752,"Abstract The Escherichia coli primosome is a mobile multiprotein DNA replication-priming apparatus that assembles at a specific site (termed a primosome assembly site (PAS] on single-stranded DNA-binding protein-coated single-stranded DNA. The PRI A protein (factor Y, protein n') is a PAS sequence-specific (d)ATPase as well as a DNA helicase and is believed to direct the assembly of the primosome at a PAS. In this report, the PRI A DNA helicase reaction is dissected in vitro, by use of a strand displacement assay, into three steps with distinct ATP requirements. First, the PRI A protein gains entry to the DNA via an ATP-independent, PAS sequence-specific binding event. Second, the PRI A protein translocates along the single-stranded DNA in the 3'----5' direction at a maximal rate of 90 nucleotides/s. DNA translocation requires ATP hydrolysis. The ATP concentration required to support half of the maximal translocation rate is 100 microM, which is identical to the Km for ATP of the PRI A protein DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Finally, the PRI A protein unwinds duplex DNA. The ATP concentration required for duplex DNA unwinding depends upon the length of the duplex region to be unwound. Displacement of a 24-nucleotide long oligomer required no more ATP than that required for the translocation of PRI A protein along single-stranded DNA, whereas displacement of a 390-nucleotide long DNA fragment required a 10-fold higher concentration of ATP than that required for oligomer displacement."
https://openalex.org/W1521370670,"Stimulation of rat Kupffer cells in primary culture with platelet-activating factor (PAF) caused a rapid hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate with a concomitant increase in the levels of myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. This phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides was independent of extracellular Ca2+ but was inhibited by the intracellular Ca2+ antagonist TMB-8. A second slower response to PAF was characterized by deacylation of PI leading to the accumulation of glycerophosphoinositol (GPI). PAF-induced GPI synthesis was not inhibited by TMB-8. These effects of PAF were accompanied by initial transient mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores followed by a rather slow influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. PAF-stimulated deacylation and phosphodiesteric hydrolysis of inositol lipids were differentially affected by cholera toxin and pertussis toxin. Pretreatment of the Kupffer cells with either of these toxins caused inhibition of phospholipase C activity. Pertussis toxin also inhibited PAF-stimulated deacylation. However, cholera toxin itself stimulated GPI release and addition of PAF to the cholera toxin-treated cells caused a further increase in GPI release. Phorbol ester inhibited PAF-induced phosphodiesteric hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, but not deacylation. PAF-induced metabolism of phosphoinositides was inhibited by the PAF antagonist, U66985. These results suggest that PAF-induced phosphodiesteric hydrolysis and deacylation of inositol phospholipids are regulated via distinct mechanisms involving activation of separate G-proteins in rat Kupffer cells. Also the regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism by Ca2+ mobilization from two separate Ca2+ pools is indicated by this study."
https://openalex.org/W1588394302,"Pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase is a key enzyme in photosynthesis in some plants that exploit the C4 photosynthetic pathway for the fixation of CO2. The gene for this enzyme has been cloned and its primary structure has been analyzed. The sequence of the cloned genes spans about 12 kilobase pairs and consists of 19 exons. The site of initiation of transcription is located 211 nucleotides upstream from the first nucleotide of the initiation codon (position -211). Typical TATA and inverted CCAAT elements are present in the anticipated regions, as well as a sequence that is homologous to the binding site of Sp-1 protein (-51 to -42). Three long, direct-repeated sequences are present contiguously in the 5'-flanking region (-286 to -172), and two of the repeated sequences include sequences homologous to the core sequence of SV40 enhancer in the 3'-end portions. Southern blot analysis, coupled with mapping by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism, indicates that the gene for the enzyme involved in C4 photosynthesis is encoded by a single-copy gene and is located on chromosome 6. To test the promoter activity of the isolated gene, a chimeric gene composed of the 5'-flanking region of the gene and a structural gene for bacterial beta-glucuronidase was constructed and introduced into tobacco protoplasts by electroporation or used to transform tobacco plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transfer of the gene. In both cases, expression of the beta-glucuronidase gene was observed, indicating that the 5'-flanking region of the gene can act as a promoter in tobacco cells."

Angiotensin II, alpha-thrombin, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) all stimulated Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport in a concentration-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin pretreatment reduced the effects of angiotensin II and alpha-thrombin but not that of EGF. Addition of the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine or down-regulation of protein kinase C by prolonged incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate partially reduced the effects of angiotensin II and alpha-thrombin and completely blunted the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced stimulation of Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport but did not affect EGF-induced stimulation. Exposure of cells to a calcium ionophore, A23187, resulted in a concentration-dependent stimulation of Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport, which was not significantly inhibited by down-regulation of protein kinase C but was completely inhibited by the calmodulin antagonist, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7). Stimulation of the cotransport by angiotensin II or alpha-thrombin was also partially inhibited by W-7. Inhibitory effects of protein kinase C down-regulation and W-7 were additive and, when combined, produced a complete inhibition of angiotensin II-induced stimulation of Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport. In saponin-permeabilized mesangial cells, phosphorylation of a synthetic decapeptide substrate for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ser-Ser-NH3, was demonstrated. Maximal activation of the decapeptide substrate phosphorylation required the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin and was dependent on Ca2+ concentration. These findings indicate that stimulation of Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport by angiotensin II and alpha-thrombin is mediated by protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases whereas the action of EGF is mediated by other pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1576861325,"We present here a chemical and enzymatic footprinting analysis of a branched DNA molecule formed from four complementary 50-mer strands. These strands are designed to form a stable junction, in which two steps of branch point migration freedom are possible. Exposure of the junction to Fe(II).EDTA shows protection of 3 or 4 residues in each strand at the branch, while two resolvase enzymes (endonuclease VII from phage T4 and endonuclease I from phage T7), cleave all four strand near the branch. Chemical footprinting of this junction using the reagents MPE.Fe(II) and (OP)2Cu(I) shows that the branch site is hyper-reactive to cutting induced by these probes as it is in an immobile four-arm junction. The effects involve more residues than in the immobile case. In the absence of divalent cations, the structure of the junction alters, sites of enhanced cleavage by MPE.Fe(II) and (OP)2Cu(I) disappear, and purines at the branch become reactive to diethyl pyrocarbonate. Our interpretation of these results is based on the properties of immobile junction analogs and their response to these probes. In the presence of Mg2+, the three migrational isomers coexist, each probably in the form of a 2-fold symmetric structure with two helical arms stacked."
https://openalex.org/W2166043855,"Active neuropeptide Y receptors were solubilized from rabbit kidney membranes using the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS). In membrane fragments and soluble extracts neuropeptide Y binding was time dependent, saturable, reversible, and of high affinity. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data indicated a single class of binding sites with respective KD and Bmax values of 0.09 nM and 530 fmol/mg of protein for the membrane-bound receptors and 0.10 nM and 1585 fmol/mg of protein for the soluble receptors. Neuropeptide Y binding was specifically inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 28 and 0.14 microM for membrane-bound and soluble receptors, respectively, suggesting that neuropeptide Y receptors are functionally coupled to GTP-binding regulatory proteins. Cross-linking studies were performed with the heterobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate and the monofunctional neuropeptide Y derivative, azidobenzoyl and led to the identification of a 100 kDa peptide that should represent the covalently labeled neuropeptide Y receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1482856850,"Treatment of cultured Kupffer cells with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 microM) for a short period of time (30 min) attenuated the subsequent platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced arachidonic acid release and cyclooxygenase-derived eicosanoid (e.g. thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin E2) production. This effect of isoproterenol was highly specific since the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine and the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol had no effect on the stimulatory effect of 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (AGEPC). The inhibitory effect of isoproterenol on the AGEPC-induced arachidonic acid release was demonstrated through the use of a specific beta-adrenergic subtype agonist and antagonist to be mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors on Kupffer cells. These inhibitory effects of isoproterenol can be mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP but not by dibutyryl cGMP, suggesting that a cAMP-dependent mechanism is likely involved in the regulatory action of isoproterenol. Ligand binding studies indicated that short term (i.e. 30 min) treatment of the cultured Kupffer cells with either isoproterenol or dibutyryl cAMP had no effect on the specific [3H]PAF binding. However, long term incubation (9-24 h) with dibutyryl cAMP caused down-regulation of the PAF receptors in rat Kupffer cells. Forskolin (0.1 mM), an adenylyl cyclase activator, down-regulated the surface expression of the AGEPC receptors more rapidly, decreasing the specific [3H]AGEPC binding by approximately 40% within 2 h. The receptor regulatory effect of dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin was time- and concentration-dependent. These observations suggest that a cAMP-dependent mechanism coupled with beta 2-adrenergic receptors may have important regulatory effects on the PAF receptor and post-receptor signal transducing mechanisms for PAF in hepatic Kupffer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1565827698,"Anaerobic nitrate respiration is regulated by oxygen at the level of nitrate transport; however, the mechanism of O2 inhibition is unknown. Potentially, oxygen could inhibit directly by causing conformational changes in the porter system or indirectly through diversion of electron flow from the nitrate reductase complex to oxygen reduction. Inhibition due to electron diversion implies that nitrate reduction is required for nitrate transport. In this regard, nitrate uptake and its regulation by oxygen were studied in mutants of Escherichia coli (strain AN386) deficient in cytochrome d (RG98), cytochrome o (RG101), and a mutant deficient in both cytochrome d and cytochrome o (RG99). Respiratory nitrate uptake in RG99 was highly resistant to the effects of oxygen supporting the indirect mechanism of electron diversion in oxygen regulation. Nitrate transport in RG98 and RG101 is highly sensitive to oxygen; these mutants exhibited 81 and 85% inhibition, respectively, which is similar to inhibition in the wild type. These results indicate that during nitrate respiration, O2 inhibits transport by limiting the supply of electrons to the nitrate reductase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1507235466,"Extensive trypsinization of the purified alpha 2-adrenergic receptor and repurification by wheat germ agglutinin-agarose chromatography yields an adrenergic ligand-binding hydrophobic core of the receptor. Allosteric modulation of adrenergic ligand binding by Na+, H+, and 5-amino-substituted analogs of amiloride is quantitatively retained in this core, as assessed by the ability of these agents to accelerate the rate of [3H] yohimbine dissociation from the adrenergic ligand-binding site. These findings refine our understanding of where within the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor structure these allosteric agents bind and, for the effects of Na+ and H+, allow certain predictions to be made as to which carboxylic acid side chains are probable candidates for participation in a monovalent cation-binding pocket within the hydrophobic tryptic core of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1588361168,"We report on the preparation, crystallization, and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody 8F5 that neutralizes infectivity of human rhinovirus serotype 2 (HRV2). Fab fragments prepared from this antibody by papain digestion were purified to isoelectric homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography and chromatofocusing. Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using ammonium sulfate as precipitant. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions a = 59.9 A, b = 86.3 A, c = 128.2 A and diffract to at least 2.8-A resolution. The cell volume suggests the presence of one molecule per asymmetric unit, and the solvent content is estimated to be 61%."
