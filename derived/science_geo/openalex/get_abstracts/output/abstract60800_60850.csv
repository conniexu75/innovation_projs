https://openalex.org/W1646291673,"Abstract A nuclease with specificity for double-stranded RNA (RNase III) has been found in extracts of Escherichia coli. It remains within osmotically shocked cells attached to the ribosomes. It sediments with the ribosomes in less than 0.20 m NH4Cl, but is detached at higher concentrations. A purification is described which utilizes this property. The free enzyme, after diethylaminoethyl Sephadex and carboxymethyl Sephadex chromatography, shows an absolute specificity for polymers containing double helical polyribonucleotide regions—other polymers (single- and double-stranded DNAs, single-stranded RNAs) are not digested, nor do they inhibit the digestion of double-stranded RNAs when present in excess. RNase III shows an absolute requirement for divalent cations, including Mg++ and Mn++, and for monovalent cations, including NH4+, K+, and Na+. The optimal pH range for the reaction is from pH 7.6 to pH 9.75. RNase III is inactivated by exposure to many substances at monovalent cation concentrations below 0.2 m. The enzyme is not a factor required for protein synthesis in vitro. Its mode of action appears to be endonucleolytic."
https://openalex.org/W2096595259,"Abstract DNA polymerase induced in Escherichia coli by phage T4 am N82 has been prepared in a highly purified state. The molecular weight of about 112,000 for this enzyme compares with a value of 109,000 for the host (E.coli) DNA polymerase. The amino acid compositions of the two enzymes, however, are distinctive, especially the half-cystine value of 15 residues for the phage enzyme and 3 for the bacterial enzyme. The purified phage enzyme contains an exonuclease activity which is physically inseparable from the polymerase activity but is suppressed or obscured by conditions favorable for replication. The polymerase requires a single stranded template, with a free 3'-hydroxyl terminus, which is replicated to an extent that approaches but never exceeds the DNA input. The product is a helical structure in which the newly synthesized strand is covalently linked from its 5'-terminus to the 3'-terminus of the template. Various features of the replication process and the product suggest a mechanism in which the 3'-terminus of the template first loops back upon itself and then serves as the priming end for replication of the remainder of the template. The evidence indicates that the phage polymerase, unlike the E. coli enzyme, is unable to initiate new strands or utilize a fully helical DNA as template."
https://openalex.org/W1598280952,"Abstract A procedure has been developed for the purification of lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, and thioredoxin from Escherichia coli B, in which the four proteins are purified together in the initial stages separation effected in two steps, and the individual purifications completed in one or two steps. The extinction coefficient of FAD in thioredoxin reductase has been determined. Amino acid analyses of lipoamide dehydrogenase and thioredoxin reductase are given. The half-cystine content of the E. coli lipoamide dehydrogenase is only one-half of that found with the pig heart enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1824075202,"Abstract The regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase from Escherichia coli were investigated. Both fructose 1,6-diphosphate and AMP were found to activate the enzyme. These two positive effectors, however, had fundamentally different effects on the sigmoidal plots of rate-concentration data with P-enolpyruvate as the variable substrate. While fructose-1,6-di-P changed the Vmax but not the sigmoidality of the rate-concentration curves, AMP only changed the Km and converted the sigmoidal plot into a hyperbola. The enzyme lost its activity on storage at 4° but could be reactivated by dithiothreitol by a time-dependent process. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed that dithiothreitol caused a dimerization of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1576027783,"Abstract Polyauxotrophic aromatic mutants of Salmonella typhimurium, previously classified aro B, E, C, A, and D, were shown to be blocked in Reactions 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, respectively. 3-Deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthetase (Enzyme 1) was derepressed about 10-fold in wild type cells grown in the presence of all amino acids except phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, and in leaky mutants grown with a limiting aromatic amino acid supplement. The first reaction was catalyzed by at least two separable isoenzymes which were under feedback control of phenylalanine or tyrosine. Enzymes 2, 3, 4, and 5 responded only slightly or not at all to end product starvation. Noncoordinate repression of the intermediate enzymes is in accord with the known observation that the genes specifying them are not linked."

https://openalex.org/W66000058,"Abstract It has been shown that the enzymic addition of valine to valine transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) of Escherichia coli is exceedingly sensitive to alcohol or salt concentrations and that the rate of the reaction is predictable from the Debye-Huckel equations, if it is assumed that there are somewhat more than 4 positive charges and 4 negative charges involved in the rate-determining step. (For instance, the binding of the tRNA to the ligase and the rate of the subsequent reaction may be increased 3-fold by 10% ethanol or decreased 6-fold by 0.15 m NaCl.) The reaction has been found to be base-catalyzed, tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, imidazole, and NH4+ being stimulatory at low concentrations but following the salt inhibition curve at concentrations above 0.1 m. It is noted that other enzymic reactions involving RNA show a strong salt or solvent dependence of the same magnitude and kind. It is concluded that, although van der Waals' forces, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic bonds may determine specificity, the binding of an RNA molecule to an enzyme also requires a great deal of ionic bonding."
https://openalex.org/W1518804869,"A method for the purification of polynucleotide phosphorylase from Escherichia coli has been developed. The purified enzyme has a specific activity 700-fold higher than the crude extract. When enzyme fractions obtained at different stages of the purification were assayed by phosphorolysis of polyadenylic acid (poly A) or 32P-orthophosphate exchange with the 5'-diphosphates of adenosine, uridine, cytidine, guanosine, and inosine, the degree of purification at each step was approximately the same. Various factors affecting the exchange reactions between labeled orthophosphate and different ribonucleoside diphosphates were examined. An activating factor which enhances the rate of the ADP-Pi exchange reaction 3- to 6-fold was isolated during the purification of the enzyme. It affects only the exchange reaction and not the phosphorolysis of poly A. It was found to be susceptible to proteolytic enzyme action, but not to RNase degradation. The effect of the dinucleoside monophosphate ApA on the polymerization and exchange reactions was studied. At low Mg++ concentration, it could overcome the lag period in the polymerization of ADP and also stimulate the rate of the ADP-Pi exchange reaction. The results presented in this report support the hypothesis that the polymerization and exchange reactions are catalyzed by the same enzyme. Their relation to the mechanism of the exchange reaction is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1526847591,"Abstract Three glycine acceptor transfer RNAs (tRNAs) have been separated from the crude tRNA of Staphylococcus aureus H. All three support the incorporation of glycine into peptidoglycan. Two of them participate in polypeptide synthesis as examined by various methods. However, one of the glycyl-tRNAs is inactive in polynucleotide-directed polypeptide synthesis as well as in the synthesis of rabbit hemoglobin. This tRNA does not bind to ribosomes in the presence of any of the known codons for glycine."
https://openalex.org/W1519586668,"Abstract In order to assess the importance of the terminal carboxyl group to the process of peptide transport in bacteria, a series of peptides without carboxyl groups has been synthesized. The compounds prepared are lysylcadaverine oligopeptides, which are analogues of lysine oligopeptides. It was observed that an Escherichia coli lysine auxotroph can use lysyl- and dilysylcadaverine as sources of lysine. However, the higher oligomers do not support growth. A mutant was selected that had lost the ability to transport lysine oligopeptides; the mutant was also unable to transport the lysylcadaverine peptides, indicating that both series use a common transport system and that this system does not manifest a requirement for the carboxyl group. Evidence from the use of this mutant points to the existence of distinct transport mechanisms for dipeptides and oligopeptides, the former having a requirement for the carboxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1482935828,"Abstract The two different subunits of aspartate transcarbamylase were characterized by their amino acid composition, amino-terminal residues, and molecular weights in 8 m urea solution. The equivalent weights for 1 amino-terminal residue agree with the molecular weights in urea solution. From these results it is concluded that the aspartate transcarbamylase molecule contains four regulatory and four catalytic polypeptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1556820416,"Abstract The partially purified, biodegradative l-threonine dehydrase of Escherichia coli was shown to exist as a number of forms ranging from 3.2 S to 8.0 S, which correspond to molecular weights of approximately 40,000 to 160,000. A protomer → tetramer equilibrium was postulated to account for these values. In the presence of AMP and at increased dehydrase concentration, this equilibrium is shifted toward forms of higher s value. Evidence is presented that oxidation or disulfide interchange yields an inactive protomer of 3.2 S, which is not converted into higher molecular weight forms by adding AMP or by increasing the dehydrase concentration. Reduction of oxidized dehydrase with dithiothreitol reactivates and allows oligomer formation. AMP also increases the affinity of the dehydrase for l-threonine about 40-fold without altering Vmax. In sucrose gradients, which approximate the assay conditions used for Km determination both in composition and in dehydrase level, the s values were characteristic of the protomer form in the absence of AMP and of the tetramer form with excess AMP. Apodehydrase was shown to have an s value of approximately 2.6 S and a molecular weight of about 40,000; it was incapable of oligomer formation in the presence of AMP. The addition of pyridoxal phosphate re-formed the active monomer with an s value of about 3.9 S; in the presence of AMP, higher forms characteristic of the native dehydrase were produced. The apodehydrase was prepared by dialysis against cysteine. Either dithiothreitol or AMP in combination with inorganic phosphate prevented both the resolution of pyridoxal phosphate and the loss in activity caused by dialysis against water or buffer."

https://openalex.org/W1600696921,"Abstract The interaction of amino pyrrolopyrimidine nucleotides with enzymes catalyzing different steps in the reaction sequence leading to the incorporation of amino acids into polypeptides has been studied. None of the analogue nucleotides could function as the energy source for activation of amino acids or esterification of transfer RNA (tRNA) by mammalian or bacterial enzymes. Toyocamycin 5'-triphosphate and sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate were competitive inhibitors of the reactions catalyzed by mammalian enzymes. Tubercidin 5'-triphosphate, toyocamycin 5'-triphosphate, and sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate were effective substrates for rabbit liver tRNA with adenosine nucleoside terminus pyrophosphorylase; the corresponding nucleosides were incorporated at the 3' termini of tRNA, and the amino acid acceptor and transfer activities of the analogue-containing polynucleotides were studied. tRNA molecules with tubercidin termini were near normal in these respects, whereas the acceptor activities of tRNA molecules with sangivamycin and toyocamycin termini were greatly diminished. The coding properties of several tubercidin-containing polyribonucleotides were indistinguishable from those of the corresponding polymers containing adenosine."

The heterocyclic base residues of nucleosides and their methyl groups have been shown to be relatively stable to this treatment. This procedure has been used to examine the degree of sugar methylation in the transfer RNA of an Escherichia coli strain and the result agrees well with values from this and other laboratories obtained by more laborious procedures."

https://openalex.org/W1491260071,"Abstract Cyanogen bromide treatment of the tryptophan synthetase A protein (α subunit) of Escherichia coli gave five major fragments, as was expected from the number of methionine residues in the polypeptide chain. Three of the fragments were isolated by chromatography on Dowex 50; their combined amino acid content accounted for 34 residues. The other two fragments contained a total of 233 residues; they were obtained in pure form by preparative electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel columns. The amino acid composition of each of the five fragments was in agreement with the composition of the tryptic peptides identified as components of each fragment. The order of the fragments in the A protein was determined, and definitive information was obtained on the order of several tryptic peptides. These results further establish that the tryptophan synthetase A protein is a single polypeptide chain containing 267 amino acid residues."

Feeding has been interpreted as a continuous process of indiscriminate ingestion and pumping of an endless column of sapropel through the digestive tract1. We have gathered evidence, however, which does not support this generalization, but indicates selective feeding."

https://openalex.org/W1607621686,"Abstract A study was undertaken of the shikimate kinase activity of extracts of Salmonella typhimurium. Chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose revealed consistently the presence of two widely separated peaks of activity, the faster moving enzyme being more unstable than the slower moving, major enzymic constituent. The latter shikimate kinase was purified more than 100-fold on Sephadex G-200. The existence of two isoenzymes could account for the absence in Salmonella of single gene mutants lacking shikimate kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1516979672,"The isolation and partial sequences of 48 chymotryptic peptides of the tryptophan synthetase A protein (α subunit) of Escherichia coli are described. Some 17 peptic and 12 tryptic peptides isolated from the chymotrypsin-resistant core fraction are also described. Together, they account for 254 of the 267 amino acid residues in the A protein. Of the 23 overlapping peptides required to link the 24 nonoverlapping tryptic peptides comprising the A protein, 22 overlaps can be recognized. However, because of the abundance of single residue overlaps, many of these cannot be defined with certainty. The assignment of overlaps and the nature of the chymotryptic core are discussed with reference to the proposed structure of the A protein."

These two peptides plus those described previously account for all the known tryptic peptides of the A protein. One of the peptides, the largest obtained from the A protein, was purified by gel filtration and paper chromatography. The other peptide could not be obtained intact in sufficient quantities for sequence analyses, but was isolated as two fragments from tryptic digests of cyanogen bromide-treated protein."

https://openalex.org/W2070416267,"GASTRIC juice of healthy people contains a high molecular weight iron binding protein “gastroferrin”1. A role for the gastric iron binding protein in the regulation of iron absorption has been proposed2,3, and alterations in its production have been described in clinical conditions of iron deficiency3 and iron overload2. The gastric juice obtained for the studies previously reported was free of saliva. Normally, however, swallowed saliva contributes substantially to the total volume of secretions present in the stomach. It was therefore decided to investigate the possible iron binding properties of this secretion. The effect of acid-peptic digestion on the iron binding properties of saliva was also studied because of the possibility that hydrochloric acid and pepsin secreted by the gastric mucosa react with the saliva present in the stomach."

https://openalex.org/W2029359527,"BOTH haematin hydrochloride and ferric ammonium citrate can abolish the protective effect of immune serum in experimental infections with Pasteurella septica in mice1. Ferric ammonium citrate has the same effect with Clostridium welchii Type A infections in guinea-pigs2. The importance of these observations depends on the fact that iron can abolish the bacteriostatic effect of sera against Cl. welchii in vitro3. Because iron compounds seem to have such similar effects both in vitro and in vivo, it seems quite likely that the bacteriostatic action of serum may play an important part in resistance to bacterial infections."

https://openalex.org/W1537477351,"Abstract Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, one of the three enzymes comprising the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, was treated with increasing amounts of 131I2 at pH 9.0 and 0°. A maximum of 2.7 moles of iodine was incorporated per mole of transacetylase subunit (36,000g). Good correlation was obtained between the amount of radioactive iodine incorporated and the amount of diiodotyrosyl residues produced. Iodination of 1 tyrosyl residue per chain occurred readily and resulted in a decrease of about 20% in the binding capacity of the transacetylase for pyruvate dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. However, the enzymatic activity of the transacetylase was not affected. Iodination of the remaining tyrosyl residues was increasingly difficult and resulted in a concomitant decrease in enzymatic activity and in binding capacity. Iodination of all the tyrosyl residues resulted in total loss of enzymatic activity and binding capacity, but did not affect the gross structure of the transacetylase. It appears that all 3 tyrosyl residues in each transacetylase subunit are necessary to maintain the integrity of binding sites for the pyruvate dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, but that only 2 of the tyrosyl residues are essential to maintain an intact active site."
