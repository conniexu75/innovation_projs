https://openalex.org/W2969705160,"Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA; valine, leucine and isoleucine) supplementation is often beneficial to energy expenditure; however, increased circulating levels of BCAA are linked to obesity and diabetes. The mechanisms of this paradox remain unclear. Here we report that, on cold exposure, brown adipose tissue (BAT) actively utilizes BCAA in the mitochondria for thermogenesis and promotes systemic BCAA clearance in mice and humans. In turn, a BAT-specific defect in BCAA catabolism attenuates systemic BCAA clearance, BAT fuel oxidation and thermogenesis, leading to diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, active BCAA catabolism in BAT is mediated by SLC25A44, which transports BCAAs into mitochondria. Our results suggest that BAT serves as a key metabolic filter that controls BCAA clearance via SLC25A44, thereby contributing to the improvement of metabolic health. The solute carrier transporter protein SLC25A44 regulates uptake of branched-chain amino acids in mitochondria of brown adipose tissue in which they are utilized for thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2969551943,"Direct recognition of invading pathogens by innate immune cells is a critical driver of the inflammatory response. However, cells of the innate immune system can also sense their local microenvironment and respond to physiological fluctuations in temperature, pH, oxygen and nutrient availability, which are altered during inflammation. Although cells of the immune system experience force and pressure throughout their life cycle, little is known about how these mechanical processes regulate the immune response. Here we show that cyclical hydrostatic pressure, similar to that experienced by immune cells in the lung, initiates an inflammatory response via the mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1. Mice lacking PIEZO1 in innate immune cells showed ablated pulmonary inflammation in the context of bacterial infection or fibrotic autoinflammation. Our results reveal an environmental sensory axis that stimulates innate immune cells to mount an inflammatory response, and demonstrate a physiological role for PIEZO1 and mechanosensation in immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2969725318,"PIEZO1 is a mechanosensitive channel that converts applied force into electrical signals. Partial molecular structures show that PIEZO1 is a bowl-shaped trimer with extended arms. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to show that PIEZO1 adopts different degrees of curvature in lipid vesicles of different sizes. We also use high-speed atomic force microscopy to analyse the deformability of PIEZO1 under force in membranes on a mica surface, and show that PIEZO1 can be flattened reversibly into the membrane plane. By approximating the absolute force applied, we estimate a range of values for the mechanical spring constant of PIEZO1. Both methods of microscopy demonstrate that PIEZO1 can deform its shape towards a planar structure. This deformation could explain how lateral membrane tension can be converted into a conformation-dependent change in free energy to gate the PIEZO1 channel in response to mechanical perturbations. Cryo-electron microscopy and high-speed atomic force microscopy reveal that PIEZO1 can reversibly deform its shape towards a planar structure, which may explain how the PIEZO1 channel is gated in response to mechanical stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2969673299,"Intestinal commensal bacteria can inhibit dense colonization of the gut by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections1,2. A four-strained consortium of commensal bacteria that contains Blautia producta BPSCSK can reverse antibiotic-induced susceptibility to VRE infection3. Here we show that BPSCSK reduces growth of VRE by secreting a lantibiotic that is similar to the nisin-A produced by Lactococcus lactis. Although the growth of VRE is inhibited by BPSCSK and L. lactis in vitro, only BPSCSK colonizes the colon and reduces VRE density in vivo. In comparison to nisin-A, the BPSCSK lantibiotic has reduced activity against intestinal commensal bacteria. In patients at high risk of VRE infection, high abundance of the lantibiotic gene is associated with reduced density of E. faecium. In germ-free mice transplanted with patient-derived faeces, resistance to VRE colonization correlates with abundance of the lantibiotic gene. Lantibiotic-producing commensal strains of the gastrointestinal tract reduce colonization by VRE and represent potential probiotic agents to re-establish resistance to VRE."
https://openalex.org/W2969814176,"Mitochondria provide chemical energy for endoergonic reactions in the form of ATP, and their activity must meet cellular energy requirements, but the mechanisms that link organelle performance to ATP levels are poorly understood. Here we confirm the existence of a protein complex localized in mitochondria that mediates ATP-dependent potassium currents (that is, mitoKATP). We show that-similar to their plasma membrane counterparts-mitoKATP channels are composed of pore-forming and ATP-binding subunits, which we term MITOK and MITOSUR, respectively. In vitro reconstitution of MITOK together with MITOSUR recapitulates the main properties of mitoKATP. Overexpression of MITOK triggers marked organelle swelling, whereas the genetic ablation of this subunit causes instability in the mitochondrial membrane potential, widening of the intracristal space and decreased oxidative phosphorylation. In a mouse model, the loss of MITOK suppresses the cardioprotection that is elicited by pharmacological preconditioning induced by diazoxide. Our results indicate that mitoKATP channels respond to the cellular energetic status by regulating organelle volume and function, and thereby have a key role in mitochondrial physiology and potential effects on several pathological processes."

https://openalex.org/W2969828256,"Background Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are both associated with an increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness. Whilst LV ejection fraction is frequently normal in both, LV strain assessment could differentiate between the diseases. We sought to establish if cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking (CMR-FT), an emerging method allowing accurate assessment of myocardial deformation, differentiates between both diseases. Additionally, CMR assessment of fibrosis and LV hypertrophy allowed association analyses and comparison of diagnostic capacities. Methods Two-hundred twenty-four consecutive subjects (53 HHD, 107 HCM, and 64 controls) underwent 1.5T CMR including native myocardial T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Global longitudinal strain (GLS) was assessed by CMR-FT (CVi42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc.). Results GLS was significantly higher in HCM patients (-14.7±3.8 vs. -16.5±3.3% [HHD], P = 0.004; or vs. -17.2±2.0% [controls], P<0.001). GLS was associated with LV mass index (HHD, R = 0.419, P = 0.002; HCM, R = 0.429, P<0.001), and LV ejection fraction (HHD, R = -0.493, P = 0.002; HCM, R = -0.329, P<0.001). In HCM patients, GLS was also associated with global native T1 (R = 0.282, P = 0.003), and LGE volume (ρ = 0.380, P<0.001). Discrimination between HHD and HCM by GLS (c = 0.639, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.550–0.729) was similar to LV mass index (c = 0.643, 95% CI 0.556–0.731), global myocardial native T1 (c = 0.718, 95% CI 0.638–0.799), and LGE volume (c = 0.680, 95% CI 0.585–0.775). Conclusion CMR-FT GLS differentiates between HHD and HCM. In HCM patients GLS is associated with myocardial fibrosis. The discriminatory capacity of CMR-FT GLS is similar to LV hypertrophy and fibrosis imaging markers."

https://openalex.org/W2969636548,"We present results of the largest multidisciplinary human mobility investigation to date of skeletal remains from present-day Denmark encompassing the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. Through a multi-analytical approach based on 88 individuals from 37 different archaeological localities in which we combine strontium isotope and radiocarbon analyses together with anthropological investigations, we explore whether there are significant changes in human mobility patterns during this period. Overall, our data suggest that mobility of people seems to have been continuous throughout the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. However, our data also indicate a clear shift in mobility patterns from around 1600 BC onwards, with a larger variation in the geographical origin of the migrants, and potentially including more distant regions. This shift occurred during a transition period at the beginning of the Nordic Bronze Age at a time when society flourished, expanded and experienced an unprecedented economic growth, suggesting that these aspects were closely related."
https://openalex.org/W2969978423,"This study evaluates the unique and combined effects of three complementary ICT-based extension methods - interactive radio, mobile SMS messages and village-based video screenings - on farmers' knowledge and management of fall armyworm (FAW), an invasive pest of maize that is threatening food security in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Building on a survey of maize farmers in western Uganda and using various selection-on-observables estimators, we find consistent evidence that participation in the ICT-based extension campaigns significantly increases farmers' knowledge about FAW and stimulates the adoption of agricultural technologies and practices for the management of the pest. We also show that exposure to multiple campaign channels yields significantly higher outcomes than exposure to a single channel, with some evidence of additive effects. These results are robust to alternative estimators and also to hidden bias. Results further suggest that among the three ICT channels, radio has greater reach, video exerts a stronger impact on the outcome measures, and greater gains are achieved when video is complemented by radio. Our findings imply that complementary ICT-based extension campaigns (particularly those that allow both verbal and visual communication) hold great potential to improve farmers' knowledge and trigger behavioural changes in the identification, monitoring and sustainable management of a new invasive pest, such as FAW."
https://openalex.org/W2969644851,"The Hippo pathway is an emerging signaling pathway that plays important roles in organ size control, tissue homeostasis, tumorigenesis, metastasis, drug resistance, and immune response. Although many regulators of the Hippo pathway have been reported, the extracellular stimuli and kinase regulators of the Hippo pathway remain largely unknown. To identify novel regulars of the Hippo pathway, in this study we created the first ultra-bright NanoLuc biosensor (BS) to monitor the activity of large tumor suppressor (LATS) kinase 1, a central player of the Hippo pathway. We show that this NanoLuc BS achieves significantly advanced sensitivity and stability both in vitro using purified proteins and in vivo in living cells and mice. Using this BS, we perform the first kinome-wide screen and identify many kinases regulating LATS and its effectors yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ- binding motif (TAZ). We also show for the first time that activation of receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) by its extracellular ligand family with sequence similarity (FAM)150 activates Hippo effector YAP/TAZ by increasing their nuclear translocation. Significantly, we show that constitutively active ALK induces tumorigenic phenotypes, such as increased cancer cell proliferation/colony formation via YAP/TAZ and elevated immune evasion via YAP/TAZ-programmed death-ligand 1 in breast and lung cancer cells. In summary, we have developed a new LATS BS for cancer biology and therapeutics research and uncovered a novel ALK-LATS-YAP/TAZ signaling axis that may play important roles in cancer and possibly other biologic processes.-Nouri, K., Azad, T., Lightbody, E., Khanal, P., Nicol, C.

However, whether an Nrf2 activator can protect tubules from proteinuria-induced tubular damage via anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress mechanisms is unknown. Using an Institute of Cancer Research-derived glomerulonephritis (ICGN) mouse model of nephrosis, we examined the effects of dihydro-CDDO-trifluoroethyl amide (dh404), a rodent-tolerable bardoxolone methyl analog, in protecting the tubulointerstitium; dh404 markedly suppressed tubular epithelial cell damage in the renal interstitium of ICGN mice. The tubular epithelial cells of ICGN mice showed a decrease in the size and number of mitochondria, as well as the breakdown of the crista structure, whereas the number and ultrastructure of mitochondria were maintained by the dh404 treatment. To further determine the effect of dh404 on mitochondrial function, we used human proximal tubular cells in vitro. Stimulation with albumin and free fatty acid increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, dh404 administration diminished mitochondrial ROS. Our data show that dh404 significantly reduced proteinuria-induced tubular cell mitochondrial damage, suggesting that improved redox balance and mitochondrial function and suppression of inflammation underlie the cytoprotective mechanism of Nrf2 activators, including bardoxolone methyl, in diabetic kidney disease.—Nagasu, H., Sogawa, Y., Kidokoro, K.,Itano, S., Yamamoto, T., Satoh, M., Sasaki, T., Suzuki, T., Yamamoto, M., Wigley, W.

We have previously shown that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)–S6K1 pathway mediates cytoophidium assembly in mammalian cells. Here, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model of a unicellular eukaryote, we demonstrate that the target of rapamycin (TOR)-signaling pathway regulates cytoophidium formation (from the S. pombe CTPS ortholog Cts1) also in S. pombe. Conducting a systematic analysis of all viable single TOR subunit–knockout mutants and of several major downstream effector proteins, we found that Cts1 cytoophidia are significantly shortened and often dissociate when TOR is defective. We also found that the activities of the downstream effector kinases of the TORC1 pathway, Sck1, Sck2, and Psk1 S6, as well as of the S6K/AGC kinase Gad8, the major downstream effector kinase of the TORC2 pathway, are necessary for proper cytoophidium filament formation. Interestingly, we observed that the Crf1 transcriptional corepressor for ribosomal genes is a strong effector of Cts1 filamentation. Our findings connect TOR signaling, a major pathway required for cell growth, with the compartmentalization of the essential nucleotide synthesis enzyme CTPS, and we uncover differences in the regulation of its filamentation among higher multicellular and unicellular eukaryotic systems.

https://openalex.org/W2969990133,"Background Achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by improving financial protection and effective service coverage is target 3.8 of the Sustainable Development Goals. Little is known, however, about the extent to which paying bribes within healthcare acts as a financial barrier to access and, thus, UHC. Methods Using survey data in adults from 32 sub-Saharan African countries in 2014–2015, we constructed a multilevel model to evaluate the relationship between paying bribes and reported difficulties of obtaining medical care. We controlled for individual-, region-, and country-level variables. Results Having paid bribes for medical care significantly increased the odds of reporting difficulties in obtaining care by 4.11 (CI: 3.70–4.57) compared to those who never paid bribes, and more than doubled for those who paid bribes often (OR = 9.52; 95% CI: 7.77–11.67). Respondents with higher levels of education and more lived poverty also had increased odds. Those who lived in rural areas or within walking distance to a health clinic had reduced odds of reporting difficulties. Sex, age, living in a capital region, healthcare expenditures per capita, and country Corruption Perception Index were not significant predictors. Conclusions We found that bribery in healthcare is a significant barrier to healthcare access, negatively affecting the potential of African countries to make progress toward UHC. Future increases in health expenditures—which are needed in many countries to achieve UHC—should be accompanied by greater efforts to fight corruption in order to avoid wasting money. Measuring and tracking health sector-specific corruption is critical for progress toward UHC."

We studied whether supplementation of coenzyme Q10, (CoQ10) a potent antioxidant, can reduce Tac-induced nephrotoxicity via improving mitochondrial function. In an in vitro study, CoQ10 reduced the production of Tac-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and abolished the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in proximal tubular cell line. Assessment of mitochondrial function revealed that CoQ10 decreased oxygen consumption and mitochondrial respiration rate increased by Tac, suggesting improvement of mitochondrial function to synthesize ATP with CoQ10 treatment. The effect of the CoQ10in vitro study was observed in an experimental model of chronic Tac-induced nephropathy. CoQ10 attenuated Tac-induced oxidative stress and was accompanied by function and histologic improvement. On electron microscopy, addition of CoQ10 increased not only the number but also the volume of mitochondria compared with Tac treatment only.

Information on gender (male, female, and transsexual, transgender and transvestite -TTTs-); nationality; health status; migratory background; and experiences with violence was obtained. Fifty-eight migrants participated in in-depth interviews to explore any experiences of violence during their journey. A descriptive analysis was performed and a probit regression model was applied to analyze the factors associated with violence. Qualitative information was analyzed to understand experiences, meanings and responses to violence.The overall prevalence of suffering from any form of violence was 29.4%. Nearly 24% reported physical violence, 19.5% experienced psychological violence, and approximately 2% reported sexual violence. TTTs experienced a significantly greater burden of violence compared to men and women. Violence occurred more frequently among migrants from Central American (30.6%) and other countries (40.0%) than it did among Mexican migrants (20.5%). Experiences involving sexual, physical and psychological violence as well as theft and even kidnapping were described by interviewees. Migrants mistrust the police, migration authorities, and armed forces, and therefore commonly refrain from revealing their experiences.Migrants are subjected to a high level of violence while in transit to the US. Those traveling under irregular migratory conditions are targets of even greater violence, a condition exacerbated by gender inequality. Migrants transiting through Mexico from Central American and other countries undergo violence more frequently than do Mexican migrants. Protective measures are urgently needed to ensure the human rights of these populations."

This transcription factor is usually latent within cells. Under basal conditions, the dimeric multidomain protein Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) binds to Nrf2 and promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by acting as an adaptor for the Cul3-based E3 ligase. Oxidants react with key sulfhydryl groups of Keap1, which then loses its ability to target Nrf2 for degradation. Consequently, Nrf2 enters the nucleus, where it forms a heterodimer with small Maf proteins. This heterodimer binds to antioxidant-response elements (AREs) to drive the expression of antioxidant enzymes that compensate for the physiological and pathophysiological outcomes of oxidant exposure (20Li J.

Crossing mice in which the Nrf2 gene is overexpressed selectively in astrocytes with two ALS mouse models leads to double transgenic mice with a significant delay in onset and extended survival compared with the single transgenic ALS mice (23Kraft A.D.

Moreover, activation of the Nrf2 pathway in astrocytes increases neuronal survival (25Vargas M.R. Johnson J.A.

We recognized that this synergism between astrocytes and neurons resembles aspects of ANG-mediated neuroprotection. ANG is enriched in motor neurons and protects them against various ALS-related insults, such as excitotoxicity, hypoxia, and endoplasmic reticulum stress (7Kieran D. Sebastia J. Greenway M.J.

Here, we reveal that ANG does indeed activate the astrocytic Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, this activation transmits survival-promoting signals to proximal neurons, protecting them from oxidative stress. The Nrf2 pathway mediates the transcriptional induction of a battery of genes that comprise the antioxidant response system. We examined whether ANG activates Nrf2 in cultured cells that were derived from ARE–hPAP transgenic mice. Upon induction, the ARE drives hPAP expression, which increases the level of human placental alkaline phosphatase (hPAP). The phosphatase activity of hPAP was measured as a readout of Nrf2/ARE-dependent promoter activation (29Johnson D.A. Andrews G.K. Xu W. Johnson J.A. Activation of the antioxidant response element in primary cortical neuronal cultures derived from transgenic reporter mice.J. Neurochem. 2002; 81 (12068071): 1233-124110.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.00913.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) is a known inducer of Nrf2 and was used as positive control in these experiments (30Kraft A.D. Johnson D.A. Johnson J.A. Nuclear factor E2–related factor 2–dependent antioxidant response element activation by tert-butylhydroquinone and sulforaphane occurring preferentially in astrocytes conditions neurons against oxidative insult.J.

Remarkably, in a mixed culture of astrocytes and neurons, hPAP activity was elevated by 249-fold (Fig. 1E), suggesting that cross-talk between neurons and astrocytes amplifies activation of the Nrf2 pathway. WT ANG activated hPAP comparably to tBHQ. Relative to vehicle, WT ANG induced the highest hPAP signal in a mixed culture, induced the second-highest signal in astrocytes, and caused no change in neurons (Fig. 1, B, D, and F). Moreover, the effect of ANG was dose-dependent, because ANG treatment at 5 μg/ml produced greater hPAP activity than at 1 μg/ml. To demonstrate signal specificity, we evaluated the phosphatase activity produced by ALS-associated ANG variants. As described previously (4Greenway M.J. Andersen P.M. Russ C. Ennis S. Cashman S.

None of these variants promoted hPAP gene expression (Fig. 1, B, D, and F). Next, we sought to demonstrate the intrinsic activation of ARE-dependent gene expression upon ANG treatment. Nrf2 induces the transcription of an array of antioxidant genes, and we selected three for analysis. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is involved in the reduction of quinones to hydroquinones to prevent redox cycling, which often generates free radicals (32Guo Y. Zhang Y. Wen D. Duan W. An T.

GSH S-transferase α4 (GSTα4) catalyzes the conjugation of reduced GSH to electrophilic substrates, detoxifying endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents (34Benedusi V. Martorana F. Brambilla L. Maggi A. Rossi D. The peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ (PPARγ) controls natural protective mechanisms against lipid peroxidation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.J. Biol.

Using qPCR, we evaluated the expression of these antioxidant genes following treatment with ANG. In this experiment, tBHQ again served as a positive control. tBHQ treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of NQO1, GCLM, and GSTα4, consistent with the results of the reporter assay, in both neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with the hPAP activity data, ANG activated Nrf2-dependent genes in astrocytes but not in neurons. Taken together, data from the reporter assay and on antioxidant gene expression indicate that WT ANG activates Nrf2-dependent gene expression. Then we asked whether Nrf2 is required for this ANG-mediated induction of gene expression. In WT astrocytes derived from ARE-hPAP reporter mice, there was a significant increase in hPAP activity with ANG treatment (Fig. 3A). This ANG-mediated increase was attenuated in cultures from ARE-hPAP/Nrf2−/− mice (Fig. 3B). As expected, none of the ANG variants increased hPAP activity in WT or Nrf2-deficient astrocytes. Further, the increase in NQO1 and GSTα4 expression following ANG treatment was reversed almost completely in Nrf2-deficient cultures (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that ANG-mediated changes are dependent on Nrf2. In astrocytes, ANG is internalized after it binds to syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (35Aparicio-Erriu I.M. Prehn J.H.

To compete with the heparan sulfate–binding site within syndecan-4, we applied a saturating amount of heparin, which mimics heparan sulfate and is known to prevent the intracellular accumulation of ANG (37Yeo K.J. Hwang E. Min K.-M. Jee J.-G. Lee C.-K. Hwang K.Y. Jeon Y.H. Chang S.-I. Cheong H.-K. The dual binding site of angiogenin and its inhibition mechanism: the crystal structure of the rat angiogenin–heparin complex.Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2014; 50 (25219815): 12966-1296910.1039/C4CC05175KCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment with heparin did indeed prevent the ANG-mediated increase hPAP activity (Fig. 3A). These data support the hypothesis that the binding of ANG to syndecan-4 is essential for activation of the Nrf2 pathway. As described above, Nrf2 is the master regulator of antioxidant responses (18Johnson D.A. Johnson J.A. Nrf2: a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 88 (26281945): 253-26710.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.07.147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Small-molecule Nrf2 activators can provide cells with powerful protection from oxidative damage (19Kanninen K.M. Pomeshchik Y. Leinonen H. Malm T. Koistinaho J. Levonen A.L. Applications of the Keap1–Nrf2 system for gene and cell therapy.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 88 (26164630): 350-36110.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.06.037Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Accordingly, tBHQ treatment protected cells from H2O2-mediated toxicity (Fig. 4, A, C, and E). The degree of protection did, however, vary among cell types; astrocytes were most responsive to tBHQ treatment, followed by a mixed culture, and then neurons. We note that WT ANG treatment likewise activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The robustness of activation appeared to correlate positively with the degree of cellular protection against H2O2-mediated toxicity (Fig. 4). As expected, WT ANG treatment protected astrocytes and a mixed culture less potently than did tBHQ (Fig. 4, B and F). Nonetheless, the protective effect of WT ANG in these cultures was significant. No protection was observed in neuronally enriched cultures (Fig. 4D). Once again, the data suggest that neuron–astrocyte communication is necessary to support neuronal survival against the deleterious consequences of oxidative stress. Previous studies have demonstrated that stressed neurons secrete ANG, which is then taken up by astrocytes (36Skorupa A. King M.A. Aparicio I.M. Dussmann H. Coughlan K. Breen B. Kieran D. Concannon C.G. Marin P. Prehn J.H. Motoneurons secrete angiogenin to induce RNA cleavage in astroglia.J.

We replicated these findings, detecting a high level of secreted ANG in conditioned medium collected from neurons exposed to a low nontoxic dose of H2O2. Using a zymogram that provides a highly sensitive assessment of ribonucleolytic activity (38Bravo J. Fernández E. Ribó M. de Llorens R. Cuchillo C.M.

Then we estimated that normal and stressed neuronal conditioned medium contained 0.5 and 4.0 μg of ANG/ml, respectively (Fig. 5A). Then we investigated how well stressed neurons are protected when treated with astrocytic conditioned medium that was pre-exposed to WT ANG. First, we treated astrocytes with 5 μg/ml of WT ANG or the inactive H114R variant. After 24 h, we collected the astrocytic conditioned medium and treated neurons with that medium for 24 h. The neurons were then subjected to H2O2-mediated toxicity. Only conditioned medium from astrocytes that were stimulated by WT ANG protected the neurons; conditioned medium from astrocytes exposed to the H114R ANG variant had no effect. Likewise, no change was observed from conditioned medium derived from Nrf2-deficient astrocytes, even upon stimulus with WT ANG (Fig. 5B). Members of the ptRNase superfamily have evolved to be efficient, nonspecific catalysts of RNA degradation (40Raines R.T. Ribonuclease A.Chem.

This observation has stimulated interest in understanding the molecular basis of the role of ANG in neuroprotection. We find that ANG activates the Nrf2 pathway in astrocytes and that this activation protects neurons from oxidative injury. In this mechanism of action (Fig. 6), stressed neurons secrete high levels of ANG, which then binds to syndecan-4 receptors on astrocytes and enters the astrocytes via endocytosis (51Ferguson R. Subramanian V. The cellular uptake of angiogenin, an angiogenic and neurotrophic factor is through multiple pathways and largely dynamin independent.PLoS One. 2018; 13 (29486010): e019330210.1371/journal.pone.0193302Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The binding of ANG to the receptor activates PKCα, which phosphorylates Nrf2, endowing it with the ability to evade the Keap1 inhibitor (52Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B.

Phosphorylated Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and forms heterodimers with Maf. These dimers bind to AREs to stimulate antioxidant gene expression that defends against H2O2-mediated toxicity. A fraction of the ANG in endosomes escapes into the cytosol. Cytosolic ANG is sequestered in granules through the recruitment of 5′-tiRNAs, which are produced by the ANG-mediated cleavage of tRNAs (9Lyons S.M. Fay M.M. Akiyama Y. Anderson P.J. Ivanov P.

https://openalex.org/W2969363258,"Metabolic pathways play important roles in proliferation and differentiation of malignant cells. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAr), a precursor in purine biosynthesis and a well-established activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), induces widespread metabolic alterations and is commonly used for dissecting the role of metabolism in cancer. We have previously reported that AICAr promotes differentiation and inhibits proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells. Here, using metabolic assays, immunoblotting, flow cytometry analyses, and siRNA-mediated gene silencing in leukemia cell lines, we show that AICAr-mediated differentiation was independent of the known metabolic effects of AMPK, including glucose consumption, but instead depends on the activation of the DNA damage–associated enzyme checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) induced by pyrimidine depletion. LC/MS/MS metabolomics analysis revealed that AICAr increases orotate levels and decreases uridine monophosphate (UMP) levels, consistent with inhibition of UMP synthesis at a step downstream of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). AICAr and the DHODH inhibitor brequinar had similar effects on differentiation markers and S-phase arrest, and genetic or pharmacological Chk1 inactivation abrogated both of these effects. Our results delineate an AMPK-independent effect of AICAr on myeloid leukemia differentiation that involves perturbation of pyrimidine biosynthesis and activation of the DNA damage response network."

The lack of Hsp70 resulted in a significant reduction in airway inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and Th2 cytokine production, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. An analysis of the BAL fluid suggested that Hsp70 is critically required for eosinophilic infiltration, collagen accumulation, and Th2 cytokine production in allergic airways. Furthermore, our bone marrow (BM) transfer studies show that SEA-induced airway inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and Th2 cytokine production were attenuated in WT mice that were reconstituted with Hsp70-deficient BM, but these effects were not attenuated in Hsp70-deficient mice that were reconstituted with WT BM.

Furthermore, our bone marrow (BM) transfer studies show that SEA-induced airway inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and Th2 cytokine production were attenuated in WT mice that were reconstituted with Hsp70-deficient BM, but these effects were not attenuated in Hsp70-deficient mice that were reconstituted with WT BM. Together, these studies identify a pathogenic role for Hsp70 in hematopoietic cells during allergic airway inflammation; this illustrates the potential utility of targeting Hsp70 to alleviate allergen-induced Th2 cytokines, goblet cell hyperplasia, and airway inflammation. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects more than 300 million subjects worldwide and has an increasing prevalence every year in both developing and developed countries (1Croisant S. Epidemiology of asthma: prevalence and burden of disease.Adv Exp. Med. Biol. 2014; 795 (24162900): 17-2910.1007/978-1-4614-8603-9_2Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Loftus P.A. Wise S.K.

Th2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, are implicated in airway inflammation and remodeling in allergic asthma (3Wynn T.A. Type 2 cytokines: mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 (25882242): 271-28210.1038/nri3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). IL-4 is responsible for Th2 cell polarization as well as the class switching of activated B cells to produce IgE. However, IL-13 is implicated in the fibrotic remodeling of airways and AHR. Because both IL-4 and IL-13 share a common receptor, they can induce overlapping inflammatory and airway remodeling effects (4Munitz A. Brandt E.B. Mingler M. Finkelman F.D. Rothenberg M.E. Distinct roles for IL-13 and IL-4 via IL-13 receptor α1 and the type II IL-4 receptor in asthma pathogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Immunol. 2008; 9 (18066066): 25-3310.1038/ni1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). IL-5 is a primary cytokine that initiates the recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils in airway inflammation, whereas IL-13 is critical for AHR through different mechanisms, including the contraction of airway smooth muscle cells, goblet cell hyperplasia, and mucus hypersecretion (6Wills-Karp M. Interleukin-13 in asthma pathogenesis.Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202 (15546393): 175-19010.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.00215.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In support of these findings, clinical trials targeting Th2 cytokines have shown promising outcomes to improve the quality of life and to control asthma exacerbations (7McGregor M.C. Krings J.G. Nair P. Castro M. Role of biologics in asthma.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2019; 199 (30525902): 433-44510.1164/rccm.201810-1944CICrossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Flood-Page P.

However, there are endotypes of asthma that are unresponsive to classic corticosteroids and to Th2 cytokine–targeted therapeutic agents; this suggests that multiple Th2 cytokines may concomitantly participate in the development of the disease (9Hastie A.T.

Additionally, the initiation and development of airway inflammatory responses to allergen exposure involve multiple other pathways that concurrently contribute to the pathophysiology of airway inflammation (10Anderson G.P.

Hsps are generally grouped within seven major families according to their molecular weight, including Hsp40, Hsp27, and Hsp70 (14Kampinga H.H. Hageman J. Vos M.J. Kubota H. Tanguay R.M. Bruford E.A.

Most Hsps are constitutively expressed at low levels in different cells, whereas the cellular expression of other Hsps, including Hsp70, is inducible and increased in response to stress conditions such as inflammation, infection, and environmental allergens (12Zininga T.

Hsp70s are highly conserved proteins within species that play a major role in cellular proteostasis and prevent cellular damage in association with other cochaperones such as Hsp27 and Hsp40 (13Malyshev I. Immunity, Tumors and Aging: the Role of HSP70.in: Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2013: 15-29Google Scholar). Inducible murine Hsp70s include two isoforms, Hsp70.1 and Hsp70.3, which are identical except for one amino acid (16Hunt C.R. Dix D.J. Sharma G.G. Pandita R.K. Gupta A. Funk M. Pandita T.K.

In allergic diseases, Hsp70 is elevated in the serum of patients with atopic dermatitis or allergic asthma (19Yusuf N. Nasti T.H. Huang C.M. Huber B.S. Jaleel T. Lin H.Y. Xu H. Elmets C.A.

Furthermore, asthmatic patients have elevated levels of Hsp70 in induced sputum and serum compared with healthy subjects, and this increase correlates with disease severity (23Hou C. Zhao H. Li W.

Those studies have suggested a proinflammatory role for Hsp70 in the development of allergic diseases, whereas other reports have described Hsp70 as an anti-inflammatory mediator (24Shevchenko M.A. Troyanova N.I. Servuli E.A. Bolkhovitina E.L. Fedorina A.S. Sapozhnikov A.M.

The role of Hsp70 in allergic diseases has been associated with divergent or dual conclusions, ranging from pro- to anti-inflammatory effects. However, few studies have examined the relationship among Hsp70, the Th2 immune responses, and allergic airway inflammation. In this study, we investigated the role of Hsp70 in the regulation of airway inflammatory responses during soluble egg antigen (SEA)-induced allergic lung inflammation in mice. Our data reveal that the loss of Hsp70 is sufficient to attenuate airway inflammation, eosinophilia, goblet cell hyperplasia, and the production of Th2 cytokines in SEA-challenged mice. Furthermore, the bone marrow transfer studies suggest that Hsp70-expressing hematopoietic cells play a pathogenic role by inducing Th2 cytokine production, goblet cell hyperplasia, and airway inflammation. In this study, we used a mouse model of SEA-induced airway inflammation model to study the role of Hsp70 in the development of Th2 responses and inflammation in mouse airways. SEA preparations of Schistosoma mansoni have been used for decades to study Th2-polarized immune responses in chronic lung diseases, including allergic asthma. SEA is well-documented as an inducer of airway inflammation and Th2 immune responses without the use of an adjuvant. Previous studies from our group and others have shown that SEA-induced airway inflammation and Th2 responses share features with other allergens such as house dust mite (5Ramalingam T.R. Pesce J.T.

The WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice were sensitized twice and consecutively challenged with SEA to induce allergic inflammatory responses (Fig. 1A). The absence of Hsp70 gene expression was confirmed by measuring transcripts in the lungs of mice challenged with SEA or saline, and as expected, no expression of Hsp70 was detected in the Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice (Fig. 1B). Additionally, the sensitization and challenge with SEA did not modify the gene expression of Hsp70 in the WT mice. Because Hsp70 interacts with other cochaperones to maintain the protein refolding pathway, we assessed whether its deletion may affect the expression of other chaperone molecules. The loss of Hsp70 did not modify the expression of the cochaperones Hsp27 and Hsp40 nor did the SEA challenge in either the WT or the Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice (Fig. 1B). The lung sections of the WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice that were challenged with SEA or PBS were stained with H&E to measure the airway inflammation (Fig. 1, C–E). As expected, the SEA challenge induced a robust airway inflammation with immune cell infiltration in the WT mice, which was further confirmed by a quantitative measurement of the peribronchial and perivascular inflammation scores. Notably, the Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice that were challenged with SEA developed attenuated airway inflammation with a decrease in both the peribronchial and perivascular inflammation scores compared with the WT mice (Fig. 1, D and E). Alcian blue–periodic acid–Schiff (ABPAS) staining was used to detect mucus-producing goblet cells in lung sections. Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice exhibited attenuated Goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus score compared with WT mice (Fig. 1, F and G). Airway inflammation in allergic asthma is largely due to immune cell infiltration in the airways as well as in the sputum and BAL fluids. We further investigated whether the loss of Hsp70 was also associated with a decrease in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) eosinophilia. Concomitant with the decrease in airway inflammation in Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice, the total count of BAL cells was remarkably reduced in Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice compared with that in the WT mice following the SEA challenge. Notably, the loss of Hsp70 induced a significant decrease in airway eosinophilia, whereas the lymphocyte and macrophage counts were increased compared with those of the WT mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Lung sections were further stained with Picrosirius Red to measure collagen deposition in inflamed airways following SEA challenge. Lungs of WT mice challenged with SEA presented an increased deposition of collagen when compared with the saline-treated group. However, Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice presented levels of collagen deposition similar to WT mice with no statistical differences (Fig. S1). These findings suggest that Hsp70 contributes to the development of airway inflammation and mucus production in SEA-induced airway inflammation. The loss of Hsp70 induces partial, rather than complete, suppression of SEA-induced airway inflammation and mucus production.Figure 2Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice have decreased numbers of eosinophils and reduced levels of Th2 cytokines in the BAL fluid.

Because the loss of Hsp70.1/.3 induced attenuated airway inflammation with decreased airway eosinophilia and mucus production, we further investigated whether Hsp70-mediated airway inflammation was associated with a reduction of Th2 cytokine production. The protein and transcript levels of Th2 cytokines were quantified in the BAL fluid and lung tissues of WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice. The Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were significantly increased in the BAL fluid of WT mice following the SEA challenge. However, the concentration of these cytokines was decreased in the Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice (Fig. 2, C–E). Similarly, the transcripts of the Th2 cytokines and IL-17 were increased in the lungs of WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice following the SEA challenge (Fig. 3, A–D). Interestingly, the transcript levels of IL-4 and IL-13 were reduced in the Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice compared with the SEA-challenged WT mice, whereas no significant difference in the transcript levels of IL-5 and IL-17 was observed between the WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice that were challenged with SEA (Fig. 3, B and D). Given that T helper cells are a dominant source of type 2 cytokine production in this model (3Wynn T.A. Type 2 cytokines: mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 (25882242): 271-28210.1038/nri3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), we examined whether the Hsp70-dependent reduction of Th2 cytokine production correlates with the decrease in Th2 cytokine–producing T cells. Immune cells that were isolated from the lungs of WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice were analyzed for intracellular cytokine production by flow cytometry. The percentage and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IL-13+ CD4 T cells were significantly increased in the lungs of SEA-treated WT mice, whereas Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice presented a significant reduction in the IL-13+ CD4 T cells compared with the WT mice (Fig. 3, E and F). Although the percentage and MFI of the IL-17+ CD4 T cells were increased in both the WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice in response to the SEA challenge, no difference was observed between the groups, suggesting that the production of IL-17 is Hsp70-independent (Fig. 3, G and H). These findings indicate that Hsp70 plays a critical role in type 2 cytokine production and the associated inflammatory responses to these cytokines in allergic airway inflammation. As Hsp70 is a major chaperone that is involved in proteostasis, we aimed to further identify the major cellular pathways that might be regulated by Hsp70 in allergic airway inflammation. The total RNA was extracted from the lung lysates of the WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice that were challenged with SEA or saline, and the RNA was utilized in a comparative microarray assay to identify genes with significant changes in differential expression (1.5-fold up or down) that could be associated with Hsp70.1/.3 deletion as detailed under “Materials and methods.” Differences in gene expression were observed between the WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice. The largest group of genes subject to change following SEA-induced allergic airway inflammation was in the lungs of WT mice (1,254 genes), whereas the loss of the Hsp70 gene resulted in the change of 678 transcripts in the Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice. WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice shared 437 transcripts with differential changes following SEA treatment (Fig. 4A and Tables S1 and S2). Serpin family B genes (Serpinb11), retinoic acid early transcript 1E (Raet1d), mast cell protease 8 (Mcpt8), Acta1, Adra2a, and Calpain 9 (Capn9) were the top up-regulated genes with exclusive differential expression in the Hsp70.1/.3−/− lung transcriptome, whereas Cxcl11, ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier (Isg15), growth differentiation factor 3 (Gdf3), and interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7) were up-regulated in the WT mice (Table S1). Common genes that were up-regulated following the challenge with SEA included Clca1, Rnase2, RetnlB, Retnla, and Ccl8 among the top genes with the highest -fold change (Table S2). We further analyzed the genes that were differentially expressed in the WT and Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice by subjecting them to a functional analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). This analysis generated major pathways that are involved in tissue inflammation and remodeling, with the top pathways including the adhesion of agranulocytes and granulocytes and fibrosis (Fig. 4, B–E). The genes involved in cell adhesion and diapedesis were up-regulated, whereas fibrotic pathway–regulated genes were down-regulated in Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice. The genes involved in the cell adhesion and diapedesis pathways were mainly chemokines such as Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and Cxcl11, which are involved in lymphocyte chemoattraction, and Cxcl2 and Cxcl3, which have been shown to regulate neutrophil recruitment (Fig. 4, C and E). These findings mirror the increase in BAL lymphocytes and macrophages of Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice (Fig. 2B). In addition, the genes involved in the T helper cell differentiation pathway were also down-regulated in lung transcriptomes of Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice (data not shown). These findings indicate that Hsp70 plays a significant role in immune cell infiltration and tissue remodeling during SEA-induced allergic airway inflammation. To understand the mechanisms underlying Hsp70-mediated Th2 immune responses and airway inflammation, we assessed the expression of Hsp70 in SEA-challenged mice. The lung sections of WT mice challenged with SEA were immunostained using an anti-Hsp70 antibody. Hsp70 was localized in the bronchial epithelial cells and the infiltrating immune cells in the peribronchial areas of lung sections from SEA-treated mice (Fig. 5A). The observed expression of Hsp70 in both the infiltrating immune cells and the bronchial epithelial cells prompted us to determine which cellular source of Hsp70 might be the key driver of Hsp70-mediated airway inflammation and Th2 immune responses. To address this question, we performed chimeric bone marrow (BM) transfers from WT or Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice into lethally irradiated WT or Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice. Thus, generated chimeric mice were challenged with SEA as described under “Materials and methods.” Chimeric mice that were reconstituted with WT BM displayed airway inflammation with increased goblet hyperplasia compared with chimeric mice with Hsp70.1/.3−/− BM (Fig. 5, B and C). Similarly, the BAL cells and eosinophils were significantly decreased in chimeric mice with Hsp70.1/.3−/− BM, and inversely, the BAL eosinophil number was increased in chimeric mice with WT BM (Fig. 6, A and B). The increased airway inflammatory responses and the BAL eosinophilia in chimeric Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice that received WT BM correlated with the increased lung inflammation score (Fig. 5C). Similar changes were observed with cytokine production in the BAL fluid of chimeric mice challenged with SEA. The Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were significantly reduced in the BAL fluid of WT mice with Hsp70.1/.3−/− BM. Conversely, these cytokines tended to increase in the BAL fluid of Hsp70.1/.3−/− mice with WT BM, although no significant difference was observed (Fig. 6, C–E). These findings indicate that Hsp70 expression by hematopoietic cells but not by epithelial cells is critical to induce airway inflammation, eosinophilia, and Th2 cytokine production during SEA-induced allergic airway inflammation.Figure 6Transfer of WT bone marrow to Hsp70.1/3-deficient mice restored airway inflammation and Th2 cytokine production.

Mothers with IUGR at 24–34 weeks’ gestation were recruited from Barnes-Jewish Hospital obstetrical clinic. Consented mothers were randomized to treatment (8 oz. pomegranate juice) or placebo (8 oz. polyphenol-free juice) and continued to take juice daily from enrollment until delivery (mean 20.1 and 27.1 days, respectively). Infants underwent brain MRI at TEA (36–41 weeks’ gestation). Brain measures were compared between groups including: brain injury score, brain metrics, brain volumes, diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional connectivity. Statistical analyses were undertaken as modified intention-to-treat (including randomized participants who received their allocated intervention and whose infants received brain MRI) and per-protocol (including participants who strictly adhered to the protocol, based on metabolite status). Seventy-seven mothers were randomized to treatment (n = 40) or placebo (n = 37). Of these, 28 and 27 infants, respectively, underwent term-equivalent MRI. There were no group differences in brain injury, metrics or volumes. However, treatment subjects displayed reduced diffusivity within the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule compared with placebo. Resting state functional connectivity demonstrated increased correlation and covariance within several networks in treatment subjects, with alterations most apparent in the visual network in per-protocol analyses. Direct effects on health were not found. In conclusion, maternal pomegranate juice intake in pregnancies with known IUGR was associated with altered white matter organization and functional connectivity in the infant brain, suggesting differences in brain structure and function following in utero pomegranate juice exposure, warranting continued investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2969578920,"Peritoneal fibrosis is a common complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) and the principal cause of ultrafiltration failure during PD. The initial and reversible step in PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although the mechanisms in the EMT have been the focus of many studies, only limited information is currently available concerning microRNA (miRNA) regulation in peritoneal fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to characterize the roles of microRNA-145 (miR-145) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) in peritoneal fibrosis. After inducing EMT with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in vitro, we found that miR-145 is significantly up-regulated, whereas FGF10 is markedly down-regulated, suggesting a close link between miR-145 and FGF10 in peritoneal fibrosis, further confirmed in luciferase reporter experiments. Furthermore, in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (i.e. HMrSV5 cells), miR-145 mimics induced EMT, whereas miR-145 inhibition suppressed EMT, and we also observed that miR-145 suppressed FGF10 expression. In vivo, we found that the exogenous delivery of an miR-145 expression plasmid both blocked FGF10 and intensified the EMT, whereas miR-145 inhibition promoted the expression of FGF10 and reversed the EMT. In conclusion, miR-145 promotes the EMT during the development of peritoneal fibrosis by suppressing FGF10 activity, suggesting that miR-145 represents a potential therapeutic target for managing peritoneal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2969522390,"Activation-induced deaminase (AID) and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit (APOBEC) enzymes convert cytosines to uracils, creating signature mutations that have been used to predict sites targeted by these enzymes. Mutation-based targeting maps are distorted by the error-prone or error-free repair of these uracils and by selection pressures. To directly map uracils created by AID/APOBEC enzymes, here we used uracil-DNA glycosylase and an alkoxyamine to covalently tag and sequence uracil-containing DNA fragments (UPD-Seq). We applied this technique to the genome of repair-defective, APOBEC3A-expressing bacterial cells and created a uracilation genome map, i.e. uracilome. The peak uracilated regions were in the 5′-ends of genes and operons mainly containing tRNA genes and a few protein-coding genes. We validated these findings through deep sequencing of pulldown regions and whole-genome sequencing of independent clones. The peaks were not correlated with high transcription rates or stable RNA:DNA hybrid formation. We defined the uracilation index (UI) as the frequency of occurrence of TT in UPD-Seq reads at different original TC dinucleotides. Genome-wide UI calculation confirmed that APOBEC3A modifies cytosines in the lagging-strand template during replication and in short hairpin loops. APOBEC3A's preference for tRNA genes was observed previously in yeast, and an analysis of human tumor sequences revealed that in tumors with a high percentage of APOBEC3 signature mutations, the frequency of tRNA gene mutations was much higher than in the rest of the genome. These results identify multiple causes underlying selection of cytosines by APOBEC3A for deamination, and demonstrate the utility of UPD-Seq."

We aimed to study myocardial deformation indices in cardiac asymptomatic SSc patients using cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) and correlate these findings to the phenotypic and autoimmune background. Methods Fifty-four cardiac asymptomatic SSc patients (44 females, 56±13 years), with normal routine cardiac assessment and CMR evaluation, including cine and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images, were included. SSc patients were compared to 21 sex- and age- matched healthy controls (17 females; 54±19 years). For CMR-FT analysis, a mid-ventricular slice for LV peak systolic radial and circumferential strain and a 4-chamber view for LV/RV peak systolic longitudinal strain were used. Results Twenty-four patients had diffuse cutaneous SSc and 30 limited cutaneous SSc. Thirteen patients had digital ulcers. Median disease duration was 3.6 years. LV ejection fraction was higher in SSc patients compared to controls (62±6% vs. 59±5%, p = 0.01). Four patients had no LGE examination; in the remaining patients LGE was absent in 74%, while 18% had RV insertion fibrosis and 8% evidence of subendocardial infarction. LV longitudinal strain differed in those with insertion fibrosis (-18.0%) and infarction (-16.7%) compared to no fibrosis (-20.3%, p = 0.04). Patients with SSc had lower RV longitudinal strain and strain rate compared to controls (p<0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). All other strain and strain rate measurements were non-significant between patients and controls. Conclusions In cardiac asymptomatic SSc patients with normal routine functional indices, CMR-FT identifies subclinical presence of insertion fibrosis and/or myocardial infarction by impaired LV longitudinal strain. RV derived longitudinal indices were impaired in the patient group. CMR FT indices did not correlate to the patients’ phenotypic and autoimmune features."
https://openalex.org/W2969405704,"In advanced chronic liver disease (CLD), the translocation of intestinal bacteria and the resultant increase of proinflammatory cytokines in the splanchnic and systemic circulation may contribute to the progression of fibrosis. We therefore speculated that fibrosis and portal hypertension (PHT) would be attenuated in a mouse model of limited intestinal colonization with altered Schaedler flora (ASF) compared to a more complex colonization with specific pathogen-free (SPF) flora. We induced liver fibrosis in ASF and SPF mice by common bile duct ligation (BDL) or by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment. We then measured portal pressure (PP), portosystemic shunts (PSSs), and harvested tissues for further analyses. There were no differences in PP between sham-treated ASF or SPF mice. After BDL or CCl4 treatment, PP, PSSs, and hepatic collagen deposition increased in both groups. However, the increase in PP and the degree of fibrosis was significantly higher in ASF than SPF mice. Expression of fibrotic markers α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β were significantly higher in ASF than SPF mice. This was associated with higher activation of hepatic immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils) and decreased expression of the intestinal epithelial tight junction proteins (claudin-1, occludin-1). In 2 models of advanced CLD, SPF mice presented significantly attenuated liver injury, fibrosis, and PHT compared to ASF mice. In contrast to our hypothesis, these findings suggest that a complex intestinal microbiota may play a ""hepato-protective"" role.-Moghadamrad, S., Hassan, M., McCoy, K.

https://openalex.org/W2969893943,"RASSF1A encodes a tumor suppressor that inhibits the RAS→RAF→MEK→ERK pathway and is one of the most frequently inactivated genes in human cancers. MUC1-C is an oncogenic effector of the cancer cell epigenome that is overexpressed in diverse carcinomas. We show here that MUC1-C represses RASSF1A expression in KRAS wild-type and mutant cancer cells. Mechanistically, MUC1-C occupies the RASSF1A promoter in a complex with the ZEB1 transcriptional repressor. In turn, MUC1-C/ZEB1 complexes recruit DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) to the CpG island in the RASSF1A promoter. Targeting MUC1-C, ZEB1, and DNMT3b thereby decreases methylation of the CpG island and derepresses RASSF1A transcription. We also show that targeting MUC1-C regulates KRAS signaling, as evidenced by RNA-seq analysis, and decreases MEK/ERK activation, which is of importance for RAS-mediated tumorigenicity. These findings define a previously unrecognized role for MUC1-C in suppression of RASSF1A and support targeting MUC1-C as an approach for inhibiting MEK→ERK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2969557157,"Calcium homeostasis is essential for cell survival and is precisely controlled by several cellular actors such as the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.

Although mitochondrial Ca2+ overload has been well-identified as being a main contributor to the latter phenomena, the origin of this Ca2+ is still unclear. Little is known about whether the internal Ca2+ stores alone are sufficient to promote mPTP opening in cardiomyocytes or whether extracellular Ca2+ entry is also required. Growing evidences have involved sarcolemmal channels and transporters such as the connexin and pannexin hemichannels (17Rodríguez-Sinovas A. Sánchez J.A. Fernandez-Sanz C. Ruiz-Meana M. Garcia-Dorado D. Connexin and pannexin as modulators of myocardial injury.Biochim Biophys Acta. 2012; 1818 (21839721): 1962-197010.1016/j.bbamem.2011.07.041Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCX (18Satoh H.

Their inhibition reduced Ca2+ overload and decreased myocardial injury, suggesting the involvement of extracellular Ca2+. However, none of these studies have evaluated the respective participation of this extracellular Ca2+ and the internal Ca2+ stores to the mitochondria Ca2+ overload process. Answering this question may help rationalizing therapeutic strategies relying on Ca2+ fluxes modulation. This maximum ability of Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria before mPTP opening and mitochondrial swelling is defined as Ca2+ retention capacity (CRC) (reviewed in Ref. 19Del Arco A. Contreras L. Pardo B. Satrustegui J. Calcium regulation of mitochondrial carriers.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863 (27033520): 2413-242110.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.03.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This feature of mitochondria may vary according to the cell type, as well as the physiological (e.g. oxidative stress and pH) or pathological cellular state. CRC measurement is experimentally performed on isolated mitochondrial preparations or on cellular models and is conventionally realized with the addition of exogenous Ca2+ enabling the simple quantification of the Ca2+ amount required to open mPTP. Therefore, the role of reticular Ca2+ stores (the major Ca2+ store besides the mitochondria) in the mitochondrial Ca2+ overload was not studied. Although several factors are implicated in mPTP opening, numerous studies have shown evidence of the crucial implication of Ca2+ overload in mPTP opening especially during ischemia reperfusion (20Talukder M.A. Zweier J.L. Periasamy M. Targeting calcium transport in ischaemic heart disease.Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 84 (19640931): 345-35210.1093/cvr/cvp264Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Bompotis G.C.

However, we ensure that the other factors contributing to mPTP opening are still present in our experimental condition by using a cellular environment. We investigated concomitantly the role of reticular and extracellular Ca2+ in the regulation of mPTP on a model of isolated cardiomyocytes. We modified the standard CRC method by combining the effect of extracellular Ca2+ (depicted by the addition of Ca2+ pulses) and reticular Ca2+ mobilization by stimulating ryanodine receptors using caffeine or ryanodine. We validated our experimental model by showing that, as expected, both pharmacological treatment of cardiomyocytes with cyclosporine A (CsA), an inhibitor of cyclophilin D (CypD), or the genetic ablation of CypD in cyclophilin D knockout (CypD-KO) cardiomyocytes required a greater amount of Ca2+ in the mitochondria to open mPTP. In addition, we demonstrated that in both normoxia and anoxia–reoxygenation (AR) conditions, reticular Ca2+ stores alone were not sufficient to trigger mPTP opening and that extracellular Ca2+ import (Ca2+ pulses addition) was required to open mPTP. Finally, we proposed an estimation of these Ca2+ sources contributions to mPTP opening. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), Ca2+ transfers were properly recorded with both probes in isolated cardiomyocyte preparation. Ca2+ Green-5N probe reported Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria after each Ca2+ pulse, followed by a spontaneous cytoplasmic release indicating mPTP opening (Fig. 1A). Conversely, Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria was reported by the increase in Rhod2-AM fluorescence after each Ca2+ pulse (Fig. 1B), proving that exogenous Ca2+ added during the assay was indeed taken up by the mitochondria. When cardiomyocytes were subjected to ∼900 s of incubation before Ca2+ pulses (Fig. 1C), CRC was still similar to basal condition (Fig. 1A) (i.e. 10 Ca2+ pulses were needed to open mPTP). In addition, cardiac mitochondria in situ and permeabilized cellular integrity was preserved during at least 2000 s of incubation in the presence of Ca2+ Green-5N probe (Fig. 1D). Fluorescence was stable throughout the experiment reflecting the absence of intracellular Ca2+ leak and the absence of fluorescence bleaching. We also used Rhod2-AM staining to confirm that the mitochondrial network was not affected in permeabilized cardiomyocytes (40 μm digitonin) (Fig. 1E) and that Rhod2-AM colocalized with MitoTracker Green, proving a strict mitochondrial localization of Rhod2-AM staining in our experimental conditions (Fig. 1F). Another control experiment for our method validation was performed on isolated mitochondria (250 μg of protein). Standard CRC was performed in basal conditions (Fig. 2A), and in the presence of 5 mm caffeine (Fig. 2B) or 10 nm ryanodine (Fig. 2C). CRC values were similar in all experiments (Fig. 2D), indicating that, at the used concentrations, these ryanodine receptors agonists had no direct mitochondrial targets. To study the effect of reticular Ca2+ on mPTP opening, CRC was evaluated either by adding exogenous Ca2+ pulses alone (Fig. 3A, black panel) or by using 5 mm caffeine or 10 nm ryanodine followed by exogenous Ca2+ pulse addition (Fig. 3A, gray and blue panels, respectively). In basal conditions (Fig. 3, B and C, black plots), 10 pulses (20 nmol Ca2+/pulse) of exogenous Ca2+ were needed to open mPTP. The addition of caffeine (Fig. 3B, gray plot) or ryanodine (Fig. 3C, blue plot) did not induce fluorescence elevation, suggesting that mitochondria take up the amount of Ca2+ released by caffeine or ryanodine stimulation (Fig. 3, B and C, insets). This was confirmed when cardiomyocytes preincubated with 1 μm FCCP were stimulated with 5 mm caffeine: an increase in extramitochondrial fluorescence was observed (Fig. 3D), representing the caffeine-induced reticular Ca2+ release that cannot be taken up by the mitochondria. The same observation was made after stimulation with 5 mm caffeine in the presence of 1 μm RU360, a specific mitochondrial Ca2+ intake inhibitor (Fig. 3E). No massive Ca2+ depletion from mitochondria was observed after a 900-s caffeine treatment, indicating that the amount of Ca2+ released from reticulum stores was not sufficient to open mPTP. Five additional pulses of 20 nmol of Ca2+ were required to induce mPTP opening (Fig. 3, B and C). The same experiments performed in Rhod2-AM–loaded cardiomyocytes showed an increase in fluorescence after stimulation with 5 mm caffeine (Fig. 3F, gray plot and inset) or 10 nm ryanodine (Fig. 3F, blue plot and inset). Overall, these experiments show that the caffeine-induced Ca2+ is quickly and efficiently taken up by mitochondria with a limited Ca2+ leak toward cytosol. Maximal release of reticular Ca2+ was triggered by three repetitive stimulations with 5 mm caffeine. However, the amount of Ca2+ released was still insufficient, and additional pulses of 20 nmol Ca2+ were necessary to open mPTP (data not shown). After stimulation with 5 mm caffeine or 10 nm ryanodine, the amount of Ca2+ necessary to open mPTP significantly decreased to 127 ± 13 nmol/mg protein (p = 0.0286) and 137 ± 16 nmol/mg protein (p = 0.0375), respectively, when compared with basal condition value (267 ± 22 nmol/mg protein) (Fig. 3G). In our conditions, reticular Ca2+ released after stimulation with 5 mm caffeine or 10 nm ryanodine represents ∼50% (48 ± 7% and 52 ± 6%, respectively) of the Ca2+ amount necessary for mPTP opening in the basal condition (Fig. 3G). This suggests that the reticular Ca2+ stores of cardiomyocytes cannot induce mPTP opening by itself. To confirm our previous results, we assessed whether preloading cardiac mitochondria with 50% of the Ca2+ amount necessary to open mPTP could allow the reticular Ca2+ content to drive mPTP opening (Fig. 4A). In three independent experiments, the addition of 5 mm caffeine (Fig. 4B) or 10 nm ryanodine (Fig. 4C) induced a strong and sustained increase in fluorescence intensity indicating a massive mitochondrial Ca2+ leak. The reticular Ca2+ release induced by either caffeine or ryanodine was sufficient to trigger mPTP opening when cardiomyocytes were loaded with 50% of the Ca2+ amount necessary to open mPTP. Both caffeine and ryanodine induced a massive reticular Ca2+ release after mitochondria Ca2+ preloading, suggesting an absence of or a limited induction of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release (CICR) mechanism. This was confirmed by the addition of one 20-nmol Ca2+ pulse after the massive fluorescence increase induced by caffeine and ryanodine. This Ca2+ pulse was not taken up by the mitochondria, ensuring that the mPTP was indeed opened. As a control of the potential effect of the experiment duration on mPTP opening, we preloaded cardiomyocytes with the same Ca2+ amount and recorded fluorescence without the addition of caffeine or ryanodine. In this condition, mPTP did not open, even after 2000 s of incubation time (Fig. 4D), demonstrating that mPTP opening observed in Fig. 4 (B and C) was triggered by caffeine- or ryanodine-induced Ca2+ release. In the presence of 110 ± 10-nmol Ca2+ load, no additional external Ca2+ was needed to open mPTP after internal Ca2+ stimulation with caffeine or ryanodine (Fig. 4E). These results are consistent with the previous observation from Fig. 3 and confirm our estimation that caffeine/ryanodine-induced reticular Ca2+ release represented ∼50% of the Ca2+ amount necessary to open mPTP. One of the most studied cardioprotective strategy within the last decade has relied on either the pharmacological inhibition or the genetic ablation of cyclophilin D, which, under Ca2+ stimulation, is known to enhance mPTP opening. Assuming that the reticular Ca2+ content is stable, we wondered whether CypD inhibition/suppression would also shift the amount of extracellular Ca2+ required to open mPTP in our experimental model. We first determined the amount of Ca2+ necessary to open mPTP after CypD inhibition/suppression and then loaded cardiomyocytes with 50% of this amount prior to inducing reticular Ca2+ release with 10 nm ryanodine (Fig. 5A). When CsA was added to the preparation, an additional 63.3 ± 14.5 nmol Ca2+/mg protein were necessary to induce mPTP opening after ryanodine stimulation (Fig. 5B, blue plot). If rotenone, a complex I inhibitor, was added to CsA, the amount of Ca2+ required to open mPTP was raised to 133.7 ± 27.0 nmol Ca2+/mg protein (Fig. 5C, blue plot). Similar results were observed in CypD-KO adult cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5D, blue plot), in which the addition of 177.7 ± 15.3 nmol Ca2+/mg protein was necessary to induce mPTP opening. Compared with the control condition tested in Fig. 4C (where no additional Ca2+ was needed to open mPTP after stimulation of reticular Ca2+ release), the inhibition/suppression of CypD in our model significantly increase mitochondria capacity to uptake Ca2+ (Fig. 5E). Altogether, our results emphasized the major contribution of both internal Ca2+ stores and extracellular Ca2+ to mitochondrial/cellular fate in normoxic condition. We next assessed whether AR would modify this dynamic. Cardiomyocytes were subjected to 30 min of anoxia followed by a 15-min reoxygenation period (in the presence or absence of 1 mm extracellular Ca2+) prior to CRC measurement. As a control (sham groups), cardiomyocytes were incubated for 45 min in normoxic condition also in the presence or absence of 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 6A). AR protocol was determined based on our previous work and on a recent study from Panel et al. (22Panel M. Ghaleh B. Morin D. Ca2+ ionophores are not suitable for inducing mPTP opening in murine isolated adult cardiac myocytes.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28655872): 428310.1038/s41598-017-04618-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), to guarantee a sufficient amount of viable cardiomyocytes after AR and to achieve a valuable measurement of mPTP opening. The amount of Ca2+ needed to open mPTP was determined (as in Fig. 3) either using only Ca2+ pulses addition (sham groups and AR1 groups) or using 5 mm caffeine (to induce reticular Ca2+ release) followed by Ca2+ pulse addition (AR2 groups) (Fig. 6A). As expected, the amount of Ca2+ added to open mPTP decreased after AR protocol. AR1 with or without 1 mm Ca2+ compared with respective sham (Fig. 6B): 108 ± 19 versus 210 ± 35 nmol Ca2+/mg protein (p < 0.0001; with 1 mm extracellular Ca2+) and 193 ± 22 versus 290 ± 40 nmol Ca2+/mg protein (p < 0.0001; without 1 mm extracellular Ca2+). In AR2, our results showed that even after AR protocol, either with or without 1 mm extracellular Ca2+, reticular Ca2+ release after caffeine stimulation was not sufficient to open mPTP. Additional Ca2+ pulses were added to trigger mPTP opening. Moreover, in the presence of 1 mm extracellular Ca2+, CRC values significantly decreased when compared with the respective condition in the absence of 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ (sham, AR1, and AR2 with 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ versus sham, AR1, and AR2 without 1 mm extracellular Ca2+, respectively; p < 0.0001). Strikingly, in none of these conditions were intracellular Ca2+ stores sufficient to trigger mPTP opening, even though the presence of extracellular Ca2+ during AR facilitates mPTP opening. In all these conditions, the addition of exogenous Ca2+ pulses was needed to induce mPTP opening. Interestingly, other biophysical features can be evaluated using our measurement method, which is described below. These stores can be estimated by measuring the difference between CRC value in sham without extracellular Ca2+ and the CRC value in AR2 without extracellular Ca2+ (Table 1). The mobilized internal Ca2+ stores in our model would be ∼187 ± 38 nmol Ca2+/mg protein.Table 1Estimation of the mobilized Ca2+ cross-talk during ARMobilized internal Ca2+ storesRemaining internal Ca2+ storesProportion of internal stores Ca2+ leak during ARExternal Ca2+ amount that entered the cell during AR(Sham without Ca2+) − (AR2 without Ca2+)(AR1 without Ca2+) − (AR2 without Ca2+)100 − [(2) × 100/(1)](AR2 without Ca2+) − (AR2 without Ca2+)187 ± 38 nmol/mg protein80 ± 39 nmol/mg protein57 ± 23%48 ± 14 nmol/mg protein(1)(2)—— Open table in a new tab The measured CRC values without 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ were significantly different in AR1 compared with AR2 (p < 0.005). Therefore, the remaining internal Ca2+ stores after AR can be estimated by subtracting CRC value in AR1 from CRC value in AR2 without 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ and were equivalent to 80 ± 39 nmol Ca2+/mg protein (Table 1). Knowing both the total internal Ca2+ amount (187 ± 38 nmol Ca2+/mg protein) and the remaining internal Ca2+ after AR (80 ± 39 nmol Ca2+/mg protein), we can estimate the internal Ca2+ that leaked during AR to 57 ± 23% (Table 1). The difference between the CRC values of AR2 in the absence and the presence of 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ represents an estimation of the amount of extracellular Ca2+ that entered the cells during AR and was equal to 48 ± 14 nmol Ca2+/mg protein (Table 1). The 48 ± 14 nmol Ca2+/mg protein represented approximately half of the internal Ca2+ stores that leaked to the mitochondria (187 − 80 = 107 nmol Ca2+/mg protein). Overall, we can conclude that in our experimental conditions, two-thirds of the Ca2+ loaded to the mitochondria during AR may come from internal Ca2+ stores (mainly from the reticulum), whereas approximately one-third seems to be of extracellular origin. Mitochondria are involved in multiple cell processes such as the control of cytoplasmic Ca2+ level because of their Ca2+ uptake capacity. This participation is particularly important when the cellular environment is subjected to major stress such as ischemia–reperfusion during which the absence of oxygen induces the drop of ATP synthesis and consequently the inhibition of SERCA activity contributing thus to several physiological mishandling including a massive intracellular Ca2+ overload (23Barry W.H. Calcium and ischemic injury.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1991; 1 (21239319): 162-16610.1016/1050-1738(91)90022-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In such a situation, mPTP transient activity could act as a safety valve, which enables Ca2+ leak with an increase rate of efflux. Ultimately, this mechanism triggers mitochondrial swelling, which has been associated with cell death. This finely tuned regulation, balanced by Ca2+ and mediated by CypD, has been extensively studied (24Argaud L. Gateau-Roesch O. Muntean D. Chalabreysse L. Loufouat J. Robert D. Ovize M. Specific inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition prevents lethal reperfusion injury.J. Mol.

However, in most of the studies, no distinctions were made regarding the origin of Ca2+ (internal Ca2+ stores and/or extracellular Ca2+) inducing the opening of mPTP, more likely because there was no reliable method to investigate it. The proposed method in this study is derived from classical CRC assay and proposes a simple mean to quantitatively estimate the respective contribution of internal Ca2+ stores and extracellular Ca2+ toward mPTP opening. CRC can be achieved by the addition of exogenous Ca2+ pulses to isolated mitochondria (27Gharib A. De Paulis D. Li B. Augeul L. Couture-Lepetit E. Gomez L. Angoulvant D. Ovize M.

https://openalex.org/W2969675319,"It is recognized that stress can induce cardiac dysfunction, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that chronic negative stress leads to alterations in DNA methylation of certain cardiac genes, which in turn contribute to pathologic remodeling of the heart. We found that mice that were exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 4 wk exhibited cardiac remodeling toward heart failure, as characterized by ventricular chamber dilatation, wall thinning, and decreased contractility. CRS also induced cardiac arrhythmias, including intermittent sinus tachycardia and bradycardia, frequent premature ventricular contraction, and sporadic atrioventricular conduction block. Circulating levels of stress hormones were elevated, and the cardiac expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker of sympathetic innervation, was increased in CRS mice. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, we found that although CRS did not lead to global changes in DNA methylation in the murine heart, it nevertheless altered methylation at specific genes that are associated with the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (e.g., desmin) and adrenergic signaling of cardiomyocytes (ASPC) (e.g., adrenergic receptor-α1) pathways. We conclude that CRS induces cardiac remodeling and arrhythmias, potentially through altered methylation of myocardial genes associated with the DCM and ASPC pathways.-Zhang, P., Li, T., Liu, Y.-Q., Zhang, H., Xue, S.-M., Li, G., Cheng, H.-Y.M., Cao, J.-M.

Specific roles of autophagy-related proteins in lung fibrosis development remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of autophagy marker protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β (LC3B) in the development of lung fibrosis. LC3B-/- mice upon aging show smaller lamellar body profiles, increased cellularity, alveolar epithelial cell type II (AECII) apoptosis, surfactant alterations, and lysosomal and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Autophagosomal soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor syntaxin 17 is increased in the AECII of aged LC3B-/- mice and patients with IPF. Proteasomal activity, however, remained unaltered in LC3B-/- mice. In vitro knockdown of LC3B sensitized mouse lung epithelial cells to bleomycin-induced apoptosis, but its overexpression was protective. In vivo, LC3B-/- mice displayed increased susceptibility to bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis. We identified cathepsin A as a novel LC3B binding partner and its overexpression in vitro drives MLE12 cells to apoptosis. Additionally, cathepsin A is increased in the AECII of aged LC3B-/- mice and in the lungs of patients with IPF. Our study reveals that LC3B mediated autophagy plays essential roles in AECII by modulating the functions of proteins like cathepsin A and protects alveolar epithelial cells from apoptosis and subsequent lung injury and fibrosis.-Kesireddy, V.

https://openalex.org/W2969805220,"Three individuals dating to the Great Migration Period (5th century CE) were discovered in a pit at the Hermanov vinograd site in Osijek, Croatia. We were inspired to study these individuals based on their unusual burial context as well as the identification of two different types of artificial cranial deformation in two of the individuals. We combine bioarchaeological analysis with radiographic imaging, stable isotopes analysis, and ancient DNA to analyze their dietary patterns, molecular sex, and genetic affinities in the context of the archaeological data and their bioarchaeological attributes. While all three individuals were adolescent males with skeletal evidence of severe malnutrition and similar diets, the most striking observation is that they had major differences in their genetic ancestry. Results of the genetic analyses of the nuclear ancient DNA data for these individuals indicate that the individual without artificial cranial deformation shows broadly West Eurasian associated-ancestry, the individual with tabular oblique-type has East Asian ancestry and the third individual with circular erect-type has Near Eastern associated-ancestry. Based on these results, we speculate that artificial cranial deformation type may have been a visual indicator membership in a specific cultural group, and that these groups were interacting intimately on the Pannonian Plain during the Migration Period."

Its function, other than cell-matrix adhesion, remains unclear. We generated a mouse strain with BP180 dysfunction (termed ∆NC16A), which develops spontaneous skin inflammation accompanied by an influx of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We used the B16 mouse melanoma model to demonstrate that BP180 dysfunction in either skin or basal keratinocytes promotes MDSC influx into skin and tumor progression. MDSC depletion reduced tumor progression in ∆NC16A mice, demonstrating a critical role for BP180 dysfunction-driven MDSCs in melanoma progression. This study provides the first direct evidence that BP180, a cell-cell matrix adhesion molecule, possesses antitumor function through modulating infiltration of MDSCs. Basal keratinocytes actively participate in skin microenvironment changes caused by BP180 dysfunction. ∆NC16A mice could be a new animal model to study the melanoma microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2969215353,"Foraminifera are expected to be particularly susceptible to future changes in ocean carbonate chemistry as a function of increased atmospheric CO2. Studies in an experimental recirculating seawater system were performed with a dominant benthic foraminiferal species collected from intertidal mudflats. We investigated the experimental impacts of ocean acidification on survival, growth/calcification, morphology and the biometric features of a calcareous species Elphidium williamsoni. Foraminifera were exposed for 6 weeks to four different pH treatments that replicated future scenarios of a high CO2 atmosphere resulting in lower seawater pH. Results revealed that declining seawater pH caused a decline in foraminiferal survival rate and growth/calcification (mainly through test weight reduction). Scanning electron microscopy image analysis of live specimens at the end of the experimental period show changes in foraminiferal morphology with clear signs of corrosion and cracking on the test surface, septal bridges, sutures and feeding structures of specimens exposed to the lowest pH conditions. These findings suggest that the morphological changes observed in shell feeding structures may serve to alter: (1) foraminiferal feeding efficiency and their long-term ecological competitiveness, (2) the energy transferred within the benthic food web with a subsequent shift in benthic community structures and (3) carbon cycling and total CaCO3 production, both highly significant processes in coastal waters. These experimental results open-up the possibility of modelling future impacts of ocean acidification on both calcification and dissolution in benthic foraminifera within mid-latitude intertidal environments, with potential implications for understanding the changing marine carbon cycle."

The infection is confirmed by conventional serological methods while molecular methods have become in valuable tools to evaluate parasitemia in treated and non-treated chronic Chagas disease patients. The objective of this study was to determine, by conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction, the presence of T. cruzi kinetoplastid DNA in peripheral blood samples from 114 adult individuals with confirmed chronic Chagas disease, before and 6.6 years (average) after treatment with nifurtimox. The samples were received and preserved in guanidine-EDTA until DNA purification. Conventional PCR assays were performed in triplicate with T. cruzi kinetoplastid DNA primers 121 and 122. The amplified products were fractionated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. A 330 bp product represented a positive assay. 84.2% (96 cases) and 6.1% (7 cases) of the samples taken before and after the treatment, respectively, were positive. The McNemar test showed a statistically significant difference between the groups of samples (p<0.001). Since serological negativization (the current cure criterion) delay many years after therapy and positive parasitological results represent a treatment failure, the conversion of pre-therapy positive conventional PCR is a qualitative and complementary tool that could be included in protocols of prolonged follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2969680197,"13C Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C-MFA) is a powerful tool for quantification of carbon flux distribution in metabolic pathways. However, the requirement to obtain accurate labeling patterns, especially for compounds with low abundance, poses a challenge. Chromatographic separation and high sensitivity of the modern mass spectrometers (MS) alleviate this problem to a certain extent. However, the presence of derivatives such as in-source fragments, multimer ion adducts, and multiply charged ions result in reduced intensity of the molecular ion. While multimer ion adducts have been reported in the field of metabolomics, their presence is considered undesirable in quantitative studies. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of dimer ion adducts in calculating the mass isotopologue distribution (MIDs) of the corresponding monomer ions for public domain and in-house generated datasets comprising of 13C-labeling time-course experiments. Out of the 100 standard compounds analyzed, we could detect multimer ion adducts in 24 of the intermediate metabolites. Further, a subset of these multimer ions were detected in all the biological samples analyzed. Majority of these ion adducts were either not detected in the original study or labeled as a putative features. Regression analysis was performed to estimate the monomer MIDs from those of the dimer. This resulted in accurate estimation regardless of the biological system, chromatographic method, the MS hardware, or the relative abundance of the dimer ion. We argue that this analysis may be useful in cases where satisfactory data cannot be extracted from the chromatographic peaks of the monomer ions."

Universal access to safe drinking water, improving coverage of sanitation in a district beyond 71 percent across the country and beyond 78 percent among the non-south DLHS districts, has the potential to realise reductions in the prevalence of diarrhoea in under-five children in a district. The effect of improved sanitation seems to work synergistically with these indicators only at better levels of prevalence of diarrhoea in under-five children in a district.

We develop and apply an empirical, stochastic bio-economic model for the Senegalese artisanal purse seine fishery on small pelagic fish and compare the simulated fishery’s development using four climate projections and two policy scenarios. We find that economic processes of adaptation may amplify the effects of climate variations. The regions’ catch potential increases with climate change, induced by stock distribution changes. However, this outcome escalates over-fishing, whose effects outpace the incipiently favorable climate change effects under three of the four climate projections. Without policy action, the fishery is estimated to collapse in 2030–2035 on average over 1000 runs. We propose an easily implementable and overall welfare-increasing intervention: reduction of fuel subsidies. If fuel subsidies were abolished, ecological sustainability as well as the fishery’s welfare contribution would increase regardless of the climate projection."

Data were collected through document review, observations (n = 34) in home and clinic settings and semi-structured interviews (n = 44) with caregivers and providers. Data analysis was based on realist principles.High levels of treatment initiation and adherence were observed. Taste masking, neutral packaging and easy storage made the new formulation highly acceptable. Caregivers developed individual strategies to deliver the treatment, particularly to overcome specific problems e.g. in case of just-weaned babies or food shortage. A refined program theory emerged from the triangulated findings showing that ease of administration combined with increased self-efficacy and competences of the caregivers, and effective provider support contributed to high levels of adherence.Formulating combined antiretroviral treatment in the form of pellets is clearly a more acceptable solution for infants and children and their caregivers compared to the syrup. Further research in non-trial settings may shed light on factors related to providers, services and the health system that contribute to better adherence of such formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2969726846,"Glycoprotein G (gG) is a conserved protein, and it has been described as a chemokine-binding protein in most members of the alphaherpesviruses. In case of the infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), an alphaherpesvirus that infects chickens, this protein is a virulence factor that plays an immunomodulatory role in the chicken immune response. Nevertheless, the gG production profile during ILTV infection has not yet been studied. In this study, we developed monoclonal antibodies in order to determine the gG production profile during ILTV infection in chicken hepatocellular carcinoma (LMH) cell cultures as well as embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs and SPF chickens using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Despite the fact that inoculated LMH cell cultures showed an increase in both gG production and viral genome copy number up to 96 h after inoculation, we observed that gG production started earlier than the increase in viral genome copy number in ILTV infected embryonated SPF chicken eggs. Likewise, a gG production peak and an increase of viral genome copy number was observed prior to the appearance of clinical signs in infected SPF chickens. According to the production profiles, gG was also produced quite early in eggs and chickens inoculated with ILTV. These findings contribute to the knowledge of the gG role during the ILTV infection as a virulence factor."

The endogenous sources of damage contributing to FA phenotypes and the links between FA and metabolic disease remain poorly understood. Here, using mice lacking the Fancd2 gene, encoding a central FA pathway component, we investigated whether the FA pathway protects against metabolic challenges. Fancd2−/− and wildtype (WT) mice were fed a standard diet (SD), a diet enriched in fat, cholesterol, and cholic acid (Paigen diet), or a diet enriched in lipid alone (high-fat diet (HFD)). Fancd2−/− mice developed hepatobiliary disease and exhibited decreased survival when fed a Paigen diet but not a HFD. Male Paigen diet–fed mice lacking Fancd2 had significant biliary hyperplasia, increased serum bile acid concentration, and increased hepatic pathology. In contrast, female mice were similarly impacted by Paigen diet feeding regardless of Fancd2 status. Upon Paigen diet challenge, male Fancd2−/− mice had altered expression of genes encoding hepatic bile acid transporters and cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism proteins, including Scp2/x, Abcg5/8, Abca1, Ldlr, Srebf1, and Scd-1. Untargeted lipidomic profiling in liver tissue revealed 132 lipid species, including sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and glycerolipids, that differed significantly in abundance depending on Fancd2 status in male mice. We conclude that the FA pathway has sex-specific impacts on hepatic lipid and bile acid metabolism, findings that expand the known functions of the FA pathway and may provide mechanistic insight into the metabolic disease predisposition in individuals with FA."

https://openalex.org/W2969507092,"We examine individual-level trading data from several markets in the PredictIt exchange to determine what strategies correlate with financial success. PredictIt provides many markets with futures contracts linked to political issues, ranging from ongoing policy outcomes to political elections. High fees along with restrictions blocking automatic trading and constraining a one-to-one match between people and accounts, combine to severely limit the upside to investment returns over the fixed costs: this ensures that traders are all retail investors. We have the individual-level data from two markets: Democratic and Republican Iowa Caucuses in 2016. This data includes all orders and trades from every trader across the markets. We are able to fully reconstruct market activity and study trader behavior both within and between markets. We show that understanding how markets and trades works is more important to financial success than proxies for (1) confidence or funding (2) information or objectivity in trading. The work should be a call-to-action in favor of simplifying markets and trading for any exchange with retail investors, and for more research into effects of differential trading efficiency in all financial markets."
