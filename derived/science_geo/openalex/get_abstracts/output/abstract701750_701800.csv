https://openalex.org/W4300861302,"Hyperglucagonemia contributes to hyperglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, novel therapeutics that block glucagon action could improve glycemic control. This phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of volagidemab, an antagonistic monoclonal glucagon receptor (GCGR) antibody, as an adjunct to insulin therapy in adults with T1D. The primary endpoint was change in daily insulin use at week 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 13, in average daily blood glucose concentration and time within target range as assessed by continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) and seven-point glucose profile at week 12, incidence of hypoglycemic events, the proportion of subjects who achieve HbA1c reduction of ≥0.4%, volagidemab drug concentrations and incidence of anti-drug antibodies. Eligible participants (n = 79) were randomized to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of placebo, 35 mg volagidemab or 70 mg volagidemab. Volagidemab produced a reduction in total daily insulin use at week 12 (35 mg volagidemab: -7.59 units (U) (95% confidence interval (CI) -11.79, -3.39; P = 0.040 versus placebo); 70 mg volagidemab: -6.64 U (95% CI -10.99, -2.29; P = 0.084 versus placebo); placebo: -1.27 U (95% CI -5.4, 2.9)) without meeting the prespecified significance level (P &lt; 0.025). At week 13, the placebo-corrected reduction in HbA1c percentage was -0.53 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.17, nominal P = 0.004) in the 35 mg volagidemab group and -0.49 (95% CI -0.85 to -0.12, nominal P = 0.010) in the 70 mg volagidemab group. No increase in hypoglycemia was observed with volagidemab therapy; however, increases in serum transaminases, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and blood pressure were observed. Although the primary endpoint did not meet the prespecified significance level, we believe that the observed reduction in HbA1c and tolerable safety profile provide a rationale for further randomized studies to define the long-term efficacy and safety of volagidemab in patients with T1D."

https://openalex.org/W4300687923,"Background Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are early symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Between 20–80% of infected individuals report subjective altered sense of smell and/or taste during infection. Up to 2/3 of previously infected experience persistent olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction after 6 months. The aim of this study was to examine subjective and psychophysical olfactory and gustatory function in non-hospitalized individuals with acute COVID-19 up to 6 months after infection. Methods Individuals aged 18-80-years with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test no older than 10 days, were eligible. Only individuals able to visit the outpatient examination facilities were included. Gustatory function was tested with the Burgharts Taste Strips and olfactory function was examined with the Brief Smell Identifications test (Danish version). Subjective symptoms were examined through an online questionnaire at inclusion, day 30, 90 and 180 after inclusion. Results Fifty-eight SARS-CoV-2 positive and 56 negative controls were included. 58.6% (34/58) of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals vs. 8.9% (5/56) of negative controls reported subjective olfactory dysfunction at inclusion. For gustatory dysfunction, 46.5% (27/58) of positive individuals reported impairment compared to 8.9% (5/56) of negative controls. In psychophysical tests, 75.9% (46/58) had olfactory dysfunction and 43.1% (25/58) had gustatory dysfunction among the SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals at inclusion. Compared to negative controls, SARS-CoV-2 infected had significantly reduced olfaction and gustation. Previously infected individuals continued to report lower subjective sense of smell 30 days after inclusion, whereafter the difference between the groups diminished. However, after 180 days, 20.7% (12/58) positive individuals still reported reduced sense of smell and taste. Conclusion Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are prevalent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is inconsistency between subjective reporting and psychophysical test assessment of especially olfaction. Most individuals regain normal function after 30 days, but approximately 20% report persistent olfactory and gustatory dysfunction 6 months after infection."
https://openalex.org/W4300689917,"Dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 10 days is the recommended treatment for patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The evidence on the benefit of high-dose dexamethasone is limited. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of 6 mg daily vs. 20 mg daily of dexamethasone in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.We conducted a single-center, randomized, clinical trial involving hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Participants were randomized 1:1 to dexamethasone 6 mg daily or dexamethasone 20 mg daily, and were stratified by the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI). The primary outcome was clinical improvement equal to or greater than 2 points by OSCI on day 28. Secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, intensive care unit-free days, and ventilator-free days on day 28.Of the 107 patients who enrolled and completed the follow up, 55 patients enrolled in the low-dose group and 52 patients enrolled in the high-dose group. Treatment with dexamethasone 20 mg daily compared with dexamethasone 6 mg daily did not result in better clinical improvement based on OSCI on day 28 (71.2% vs. 78.2%; odds ratio, 1.45 [0.55-3.86]; p = 0.403). For participants who required high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation at randomization, the 6-mg group had better survival than the 20-mg group on day 28 (100% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.025). Although more participants in the 6-mg group received immune modulators (40% vs. 21.2%; p = 0.035), 50% of death cases in the 20-mg group who required high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation at randomization received immune modulators.Dexamethasone 20 mg daily did not result in better clinical outcome improvement, and was probably associated with higher 28-day mortality in patients on high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation, compared with dexamethasone 6 mg daily.Clinialtrials.gov number, NCT04707534, registered January 13, 2021."

In order to achieve a positive relationship and interaction between environmental regulation, research and development (R&D) investment, and green technology innovation, and effectively solve the ""strange circle"" problem between high-quality economic development and environmental pollution in China and even the world, this paper takes the panel data of industrial enterprises above designated size in Chinese mainland 31 provinces from 2009 to 2019 as a research sample. The comprehensive index of R&D investment and green technology innovation was established by the entropy method, and the panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model was constructed from the dynamic endogenous perspective, and the dynamic interaction and regional heterogeneity between environmental regulation, R&D investment, and green technology innovation were empirically analyzed by using impulse response function and variance decomposition. We obtain the following findings: (1) Environmental regulation has a two-way interaction relationship with R&D investment and green technology innovation, and R&D investment has a promotion effect on the ""green degree"" of technological innovation, but its role is still weak and has lagging characteristics. (2) There is significant regional heterogeneity in the dynamic responses of the eastern, central and western parts of China. (3) In the long run, environmental regulation has a ""negative crowding out effect"" on R&D investment in the central region, and the phenomenon of ""central collapse"" still exists but will gradually weaken. Environmental regulation has a ""positive innovation compensation effect"" on green technology innovation. Green technology innovation and R&D investment have an obvious ""Pareto improvement"" effect on environmental regulation, especially in the eastern region. The conclusions of this study help to clarify the dynamic interaction between environmental regulation, R&D investment, and green technology innovation, further improve environmental regulatory policies and green technology innovation R&D decision-making, and provide an effective way to achieve green and sustainable development in China and other parts of the world."

https://openalex.org/W4300688456,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has many variants capable of rapid transmission causing serious illness. Timely surveillance of new variants is essential for an effective public health response. Ensuring availability and access to diagnostic and molecular testing is key to this type of surveillance. This study utilized reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and whole genome sequencing results from COVID-19-positive patient samples obtained through a collaboration between Aegis Sciences Corporation and Walgreens Pharmacy that has conducted more than 8.5 million COVID-19 tests at ~5,200 locations across the United States and Puerto Rico. Viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to mutations in the S-gene that cause reduced or failed S-gene amplification in diagnostic PCR tests. These anomalies, labeled reduced S-gene target performance (rSGTP) and S-gene target failure (SGTF), are characteristic of variants carrying the del69-70 mutation, such as Alpha and Omicron (B.1.1.529, BA.1, and BA.1.1) lineages. This observation has been validated by whole genome sequencing and can provide presumptive lineage data following completion of diagnostic PCR testing in 24-48 hours from collection. Active surveillance of trends in PCR and sequencing results is key to the identification of changes in viral transmission and emerging variants. This study shows that rSGTP and SGTF can be utilized for near real-time tracking and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and is superior to the use of SGTF alone due to the significant proportion of Alpha and Omicron (B.1.1.529, BA.1, and BA.1.1) lineages known to carry the del69-70 mutation and observed to have S-gene amplification. Adopting new tools and techniques to both diagnose acute infections and expedite identification of emerging variants is critical to supporting public health."

https://openalex.org/W4300689174,"“Open banking,” as a concept, was initially developed by a UK regulation to foster competition in banking through sharing client data (with their consent) amongst competitors. Today, it is regulated in several most relevant banking jurisdictions. Despite its growing relevance, consensus about the definition of open banking is lacking. This study examines 282 articles on open banking using bibliometric clustering techniques. Moreover, within the 282 articles and applying discourse analysis, we analyze 47 idiosyncratic definitions of open banking to test an integral framework that supports our proposed definition of the concept. Our study contributes to the literature by providing a generalized multidisciplinary definition of open banking. It identifies four main drivers behind the concept: business model change, client data sharing, incorporation of technological companies (fintechs and others), and regulation. These four elements, which should be considered in new regulations in the globalized banking sector, foresee open banking as a critical enabler of a new strategic dynamic in banking."
https://openalex.org/W4300689284,"Background Studies on the susceptibility of vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms to coronary artery disease (CAD) reached controversial results. We performed this study for a more accurate evaluation between the VDR polymorphisms and CAD susceptibility. Methods PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wan Fang, and VIP databases were searched. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to evaluate the associations. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was introduced to estimate the positive associations. The potential functions of the VDR polymorphisms were analyzed based on the SNPinfo and ENSEMBL databases. Results Thirteen studies were finally included. In the overall analysis, increased CAD risks were observed in the VDR rs1544410 polymorphism and verified by the TSA; for the rs2228570 and rs731236 polymorphisms, significant associations with high heterogeneity were detected; decreased risk was remarkably observed for the rs7975232 polymorphism. In the subgroup analysis, wide associations with reduced heterogeneity were observed in the rs2228570, rs1544410, and rs731236 polymorphisms. The RNAfold analysis indicated the mutant G allele of the rs1544410 polymorphism was easier to disperse from the DNA double helix structure and may have a potential crucial role in the VDR transcription process. Conclusions Our analysis supports the role of the rs1544410 polymorphism in the VDR gene as a risk factor for CAD. The VDR rs2228570 and rs731236 polymorphisms were associated with increased CAD risks in the White population. Restrict decreased CAD risk was firstly discovered in the rs7975232 polymorphism. Limitations Firstly, the language was restricted to English and Chinese, which will cause the limited number of studies included; secondly, other unknown polymorphisms in VDR polymorphisms could also be associated the CAD susceptibility, and more case-control studies with comprehensive clinical outcomes and GWAS studies were required; thirdly, the rs1544410, rs7975232 and rs731236 polymorphism are in strong LD, haploid factors with CAD risk need to be considered; fourthly, the mechanisms of the VDR polymorphism on the VDR gene or RNA or protein were not discussed enough, further mechanistic studies are required; at last, genetic factor was the one side for CAD susceptibility, the interaction between environmental risk factors should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W4300689772,"The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of genes related to muscle growth, hypoxia and oxidative stress responses, a multi-substrate serine/threonine-protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK-related kinases, carbohydrate metabolism, satellite cells activities and fibro- adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) in fast-growing (FG) (n = 30) and medium-growing (MG) chickens (n = 30). Pectoralis major muscles were collected at 7d, 14d, 21d, 28d, 35d and 42d of age. According to their macroscopic features, the samples from FG up to 21d of age were classified as unaffected, while all samples collected at an older age exhibited macroscopic features ascribable to white striping and/or wooden breast abnormalities. In contrast, MG samples did not show any feature associated to muscle disorders. The absolute transcript abundance of 33 target genes was examined by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. The results showed differential gene expression profiles between FG and MG chickens at different ages. While most genes remained unchanged in MG chickens, the expression patterns of several genes in FG were significantly affected by age. Genes encoding alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 2 and gamma 3 isoforms of AMPK, as well as AMPK-related kinases, were identified as differentially expressed between the two strains. The results support the hypothesis of oxidative stress-induced muscle damage with metabolic alterations in FG chickens. An increased expression of ANXA2, DES, LITAF, MMP14, MYF5 and TGFB1 was observed in FG strain. The results suggest the occurrence of dysregulation of FAP proliferation and differentiation occurring during muscle repair. FAPs could play an important role in defining the proliferation of connective tissue (fibrosis) and deposition of intermuscular adipose tissue which represents distinctive traits of muscle abnormalities. Overall, these findings demonstrate that dysregulated molecular processes associated with myopathic lesions in chickens are strongly influenced by growth rate, and, to some extent, by age."
https://openalex.org/W4300690802,"Evidence suggests that older people aged ≥65 years and those aged 60–64 years with chronic medical conditions are at higher risk of developing severe complications due to influenza virus infection when compared with young, healthy adults. Although seasonal influenza is monitored through a nationwide passive surveillance in Japan, influenza related outcomes and medical resource consumption have not been fully documented. This retrospective database study aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of medically attended influenza cases aged ≥60 years and the associated medical resource consumption in Japan. We used clinically diagnosed influenza (CDI) based on the international classification of disease codes, and laboratory-confirmed influenza (LCI) based on influenza test results, to identify the patient population during a total of nine seasons (2010/2011 to 2018/2019). A total of 372,356 CDI and 31,122 LCI cases were identified from 77 medical institutions. The highest numbers of medically-attended influenza episodes were in patients aged 65–74 years and 75–84 years. On average, across seasons, 5.9% of all-cause hospitalizations were attributable to CDI and 0.4% were LCI. Influenza viruses type A and B co-circulated annually in varying degree of intensity and were associated with similar level of complications, including cardiovascular-related. Oxygen therapy increased with age; by contrast, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, blood transfusion, and intensive care unit admission were higher in the younger groups. In-hospital mortality for inpatients aged ≥ 85 years with CDI and LCI were 18.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Considering the burden associated with medically-attended influenza in this population, influenza prevention, laboratory confirmation and clinical management should be emphasized by general practicians and specialists like cardiologists to protect this aging population."
https://openalex.org/W4300690850,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common brain motor disorder, characterized by a substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Motor impairments, such as dyskinesia, bradykinesia, and resting tremors, are the hallmarks of PD. Despite ongoing research, the exact PD pathogenesis remains elusive due to the disease intricacy and difficulty in conducting human studies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as an ideal model for researching PD pathophysiology. Even though 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been used to induce PD in zebrafish, behavioural findings are frequently limited to a single time point (24 hours post-injection). In this sense, we aim to demonstrate the effects of MPTP on zebrafish swimming behaviour at multiple time points. We administered a single dosage of MPTP (200μg/g bw) via intraperitoneal injection (i/p) and assessed the locomotor activity and swimming pattern at 0h, 24h, and 96h post-injection through an open field test. Analysis of the behaviour revealed significant reductions in swimming velocity (cm/s) and distance travelled (cm), concurrent with an increase in freezing maintenance (duration and bouts) in zebrafish injected with MPTP. In addition, the MPTP-injected zebrafish exhibited complex swimming patterns, as measured by the turn angle, meander, and angular velocity, and showed abnormal swimming phenotypes, including freezing, looping, and erratic movement. To conclude, MPTP administration into adult zebrafish induced hypolocomotion and elicited motor incoordination. Plus, the effects of MPTP were observable 24 hours after the injection and still detectable 96 hours later. These findings contribute to the understanding of MPTP effects on adult zebrafish, particularly in terms of swimming behaviours, and may pave the way for a better understanding of the establishment of PD animal models in the future."

A better understanding of molecular events underlying the biological behavior of this tumor, as well as identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets are the prerequisite to improve its clinical management. ZNF521 gene amplifications are present in >6% of OCs and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that it may play an important role in OC. Increased ZNF521 expression resulted in an enhancement of OC HeyA8 and ES-2 cell growth and motility. Analysis of RNA isolated from transduced cells by RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR revealed that several genes involved in growth, proliferation, migration and tumor invasiveness are differentially expressed following increased ZNF521 expression. The data illustrate a novel biological role of ZNF521 in OC that, thanks to the early and easy detection by RNA-Seq, can be used as biomarker for identification and treatment of OC patients."
https://openalex.org/W4300689138,"This study aims to propose a novel and high-accuracy prediction model of plastic limit (PL) based on soil particles passing through sieve # 200 (0.075 mm) using gene expression programming (GEP). PL is used for the classification of fine-grained soils which are particles passing from sieve # 200. However, it is conventionally evaluated using sieve # 40 passing material. According to literature, PL should be determined using sieve # 200 passing material. Although, PL200 is considered the accurate representation of plasticity of soil, its' determination in laboratory is time consuming and difficult task. Additionally, it is influenced by clay and silt content along with sand particles. Thus, artificial intelligence-based techniques are considered viable solution to propose the prediction model which can incorporate multiple influencing parameters. In this regard, the laboratory experimental data was utilized to develop prediction model for PL200 using gene expression programming considering sand, clay, silt and PL using sieve 40 material (PL40) as input parameters. The prediction model was validated through multiple statistical checks such as correlation coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and relatively squared error (RSE). The sensitivity and parametric studies were also performed to further justify the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model. The results show that the model meets all of the criteria and can be used in the field."

The GIFT macro applies a validated method which distinguishes fiber diameters based on distance frequencies within an image. In this work, we introduce an applied version of the GIFT method which has been designed to be user-friendly while still allowing complete control over the various parameters involved in the image processing steps. The macro quickly processes large data sets and creates results that are reproducible and accurate. The program outputs both raw data and fiber diameter averages, so that the user can quickly assess the results and has the opportunity for further analysis if desired. The GIFT macro was compared directly to other software designed for fiber diameter measurements and was found to have comparable or lower average error, especially when measuring very small fibers, and reduced processing times per image. The macro, detailed instructions for use, and sample images are freely available online ( https://github.com/IBMTRostock/GIFT ). We believe that the GIFT macro is a valuable new tool for researchers looking to quickly, easily and reliably assess fiber diameters in electrospun materials."
https://openalex.org/W4300689472,"Mitral valve reconstruction (MVR) is one of the cardiosurgical procedures which cannot be substituted by any intervention owing to the quality of the quasi-anatomical, physiological repair. However, technique and strategies have changed over the years. We looked at procedural characteristics and outcome in an all-comer, non-selected cohort of patients.738 out of 1.977 patients were retrospectively analyzed receiving MVR with and without concomitant procedures. The cohort was divided into three periods. P1: 2004-2009 (134 pts.); P2: 2010-2014 (294 pts.), and P3: 2015-2019 (310 pts.).Early mortality increased from P1 to P2 and decreased from P2 to P3 (9% P1, 13% P2, 10% P3). All patients received an annuloplasty-ring. In P1 resection measures dominated. In P3 artificial chordae were dominant. Age, BMI, and risk scores correlated with early mortality. Survival rates were 66% (5-years), 55% (10-years), 44% (15-years) in P1, 63% (5-years), 50% (10-years) in P2, and 80% (5-years) in P3. Odds ratio for reduced long-term survival were concomitant venous only bypass surgery (10-years 2,701, p = 0.026). 10-year survival was positively influenced by isolated MVR (0.246, p = 0.001), concomitant isolated arterial bypass (IMA) (0.153, p = 0.051), posterior leaflet measure (0.178, p<0.001), and use of artificial chordae (5-years 0.235, p<0.001).Indication for ring implantation remained mandatory while preference changed alongside improved designs. Procedural characteristics changed from mainly resection maneuvers to predominant use of artificial chordae. Long-term results were negatively influenced by co-morbidities and positively influenced by posterior leaflet repair and artificial chordae.

The audit data were collected based on the European Society of Endodontology guidelines retrospectively via assessing the patient's clinical records and intraoral periapical radiograph. Root canal obturation quality was evaluated based on the following parameters: adaptation, length, taper, and mishap. A root filling is defined as satisfactory only when all four parameters were graded as acceptable. Subsequently, the data were recorded and analysed using Chi-Square test with the level of significance set at p = 0.05.A total of 111 patient records with 111 root canal-treated teeth were evaluated. The highest percentage of documented evidence was noted in the patient's general records, while the endodontic treatment records showed the lowest percentage of documented evidence. 78 (70.3%) of root canal-treated teeth were deemed satisfactory with acceptable adaptation, length, taper, and absence of mishap. Moreover, no statistical significance in terms of root canal filling quality was noted between anterior and posterior teeth, and between maxillary and mandibular arch.Although patient records and root canal fillings quality were deemed satisfactory in most cases, strict documentation requirements and continuing dental education in audit training are necessary for quality assurance."

https://openalex.org/W4300817233,"In low-dimensional data and within the framework of a classical linear regression model, we intend to compare variable selection methods and investigate the role of shrinkage of regression estimates in a simulation study. Our primary aim is to build descriptive models that capture the data structure parsimoniously, while our secondary aim is to derive a prediction model. Simulation studies are an important tool in statistical methodology research if they are well designed, executed, and reported. However, bias in favor of an ""own"" preferred method is prevalent in most simulation studies in which a new method is proposed and compared with existing methods. To overcome such bias, neutral comparison studies, which disregard the superiority or inferiority of a particular method, have been proposed. In this paper, we designed a simulation study with key principles of neutral comparison studies in mind, though certain unintentional biases cannot be ruled out. To improve the design and reporting of a simulation study, we followed the recently proposed ADEMP structure, which entails defining the aims (A), data-generating mechanisms (D), estimand/target of analysis (E), methods (M), and performance measures (P). To ensure the reproducibility of results, we published the protocol before conducting the study. In addition, we presented earlier versions of the design to several experts whose feedback influenced certain aspects of the design. We will compare popular penalized regression methods (lasso, adaptive lasso, relaxed lasso, and nonnegative garrote) that combine variable selection and shrinkage with classical variable selection methods (best subset selection and backward elimination) with and without post-estimation shrinkage of parameter estimates."
https://openalex.org/W4300688160,"Recent neurocognitive models of second language learning have posited specific roles for declarative and procedural memory in the processing of novel linguistic stimuli. Pursuing this line of investigation, the present exploratory study examined the role of declarative and procedural memory abilities in the early stages of adult comprehension of sentences in a miniature language with natural language characteristics (BrocantoJ). Thirty-six native Italian young adults were aurally exposed to BrocantoJ in the context of a computer game over three sessions on consecutive days. Following vocabulary training and passive exposure, participants were asked to perform game moves described by aural sentences in the language. Game trials differed with respect to the information the visual context offered. In part of the trials processing of relationships between grammatical properties of the language (word order and morphological case marking) and noun semantics (thematic role) was necessary in order reach an accurate outcome, whereas in others nongrammatical contextual cues were sufficient. Declarative and procedural learning abilities were respectively indexed by visual and verbal declarative memory measures and by a measure of visual implicit sequence learning. Overall, the results indicated a substantial role of declarative learning ability in the early stages of sentence comprehension, thus confirming theoretical predictions and the findings of previous similar studies in miniature artificial language paradigms. However, for trials that specifically probed the learning of relationships between morphosyntax and semantics, a positive interaction between declarative and procedural learning ability also emerged, indicating the cooperative engagement of both types of learning abilities in the processing of relationships between ruled-based grammar and interpretation in the early stages of exposure to a new language in adults."

The highest recorded relative potential habitat increase was observed for O. stricta at ~205% under RCP2.6 and ~223% under RCP8.5. Although L. camara and O. stricta were observed to have habitat losses, the losses will be very low as compared to that of S. campylacanthum. L. camara and O. stricta relative habitat losses were predicted to be between ~1% under RCP2.6 to ~4.5% under RCP8.5 by 2070 while that of S. campylacanthum was between ~50% under RCP2.6 to ~68% under RCP8.5 by the year 2070. From this study we conclude that the target study species are expected to remain a big threat to inhabited areas as well as biodiversity hotspot areas especially in the Mt. Kenya and the Aberdare forest and national park reserves under climate change. The information generated through this study can be used to inform policy on prioritizing management of these species and subsequent determination of their absolute distributions within the area."
https://openalex.org/W4300689122,"The recent era has witnessed exponential growth in the production of multimedia data which initiates exploration and expansion of certain domains that will have an overwhelming impact on human society in near future. One of the domains explored in this article is content-based image retrieval (CBIR), in which images are mostly encoded using hand-crafted approaches that employ different descriptors and their fusions. Although utilization of these approaches has yielded outstanding results, their performance in terms of a semantic gap, computational cost, and appropriate fusion based on problem domain is still debatable. In this article, a novel CBIR method is proposed which is based on the transfer learning-based visual geometry group (VGG-19) method, genetic algorithm (GA), and extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. In the proposed method, instead of using hand-crafted features extraction approaches, features are extracted automatically using a transfer learning-based VGG-19 model to consider both local and global information of an image for robust image retrieval. As deep features are of high dimension, the proposed method reduces the computational expense by passing the extracted features through GA which returns a reduced set of optimal features. For image classification, an extreme learning machine classifier is incorporated which is much simpler in terms of parameter tuning and learning time as compared to other traditional classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on five datasets which highlight the better performance in terms of evaluation metrics as compared with the state-of-the-art image retrieval methods. Its statistical analysis through a nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test also exhibits significant performance."
https://openalex.org/W4300689278,"Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a common molecular tool to analyse the expression of transcripts in non-traditional animal models. Most animals experience tissue-specific seasonal changes in cell structure, growth, and cellular function. As a consequence, the choice of reference or 'house-keeping' genes is essential to standardize expression levels of target transcripts of interest for qPCR analyses. This study aimed to determine the abundance, efficiency and stability of several reference genes commonly used for normalisation of qPCR analyses in a model of seasonal biology: the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus). Liver, brown-adipose tissue (BAT), white adipose tissue (WAT), testes, spleen, kidney, the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, and the pituitary gland from either long or short photoperiod Siberian hamsters were dissected to test tissue-specific and photoperiod effects on reference transcripts. qPCR was conducted for common reference genes including 18s ribosomal RNA (18s), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt), and actin-β (Act). Cycling time (Ct), efficiency (E) and replicate variation of Ct and E measured by percent coefficient of variance (CV%) was determined using PCR miner. Measures of stability were assessed using a combined approach of NormFinder and BestKeeper. 18s and Act did not vary in Ct across photoperiod conditions. Splenic, WAT and BAT Gapdh Ct was higher in long compared to short photoperiod. Splenic Hprt Ct was higher in long photoperiods. There was no significant effect of photoperiod, tissue or interaction on measures of efficiency, Ct CV%, or efficiency CV%. NormFinder and BestKeeper confirmed that 18s, Gapdh and Hprt were highly stable, while Act showed low stability. These findings suggest that 18s and Hprt show the most reliable stability, efficiency, and abundance across the tissues. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive and standardised approach to assess multiple reference genes in the Siberian hamster and help to inform molecular assays used in studies of photoperiodism."
https://openalex.org/W4300689556,"Calcareous red algae are foundation species and ecosystem engineers with a global distribution. The principles governing their calcification pathways are still debated and the morphological characters are frequently unreliable for species segregation, as shown by molecular genetics. The recent description of the new species Lithophyllum pseudoracemus, previously undetected and morphologically confused with Lithophyllum racemus, offered a challenging opportunity to test the effectiveness of microanatomy and ultrastructural calcification traits as tools for the identification of these two species, for integrative taxonomy. High resolution SEM images of molecularly identified samples showed that the different size of the perithallial cells and the features of the asexual conceptacle chambers may contribute to the separation of the two species. The two species share the same crystallite morphology in the primary and secondary cell-wall calcification, as previously described in other species belonging to the same clade. However, the perithallial secondary calcification was significantly thicker in L. racemus than in L. pseudoracemus. We described a granular calcified layer in the innermost part of the cell wall, as a putative precursor phase in the biomineralization and formation of the secondary calcification. The hypothesis of different pathways for the formation of the primary and secondary calcification is supported by the observed cell elongation associated with thicker and higher Mg/Ca primary calcification, the inverse correlation of primary and secondary calcification thickness, and the absence of primary calcification in the newly formed wall cutting off an epithallial cell from the meristem."
https://openalex.org/W4300689824,"Economic evaluations have been widely used to inform and guide policy-making process in healthcare resources allocation as a part of an evidence package. An intervention is considered cost-effective if an ICER is less than a cost-effectiveness threshold (CET), where a CET represents the acceptable price for a unit of additional health gain which a decision-maker is willing to pay. There has been discussion to increase a CET in many settings such as the United Kingdom and Thailand. To the best of our knowledge, Thailand is the only country that has an explicit CET and has revised their CET, not once but twice. Hence, the situation in Thailand provides a unique opportunity for evaluating the impact of changing CET on healthcare expenditure and manufacturers' behaviours in the real-world setting. Before we decide whether a CET should be increased, information on what happened after the CET was increased in the past could be informative and helpful.This study protocol describes a proposed plan to investigate the impact of increased cost-effectiveness threshold using Thailand as a case study. Specifically, we will examine the impact of increasing CET on the drug prices submitted by pharmaceutical companies to the National List of Essential Medicine (NLEM), the decision to include or exclude medications in the NLEM, and the overall budget impact.Retrospective data analysis of the impact of increased CET on national drug committee decisions in Thailand (an upper middle-income country) will be conducted and included data from various sources such as literature, local organizations (e.g. Thai Food and Drug Administration), and inputs from stakeholder consultation meetings. The outcomes include: (1) drug price submitted by the manufacturers and final drug price included in the NLEM if available; (2) decisions about whether the drug was included in the NLEM for reimbursement; and (3) budget impact. The independent variables include a CET, the variable of interest, which can take values of THB100,000, THB120,000, or THB160,000, and potential confounders such as whether this drug was for a chronic disease, market size, and primary endpoint. We will conduct separate multivariable regression analysis for each outcome specified above.Understanding the impact of increasing the CET would be helpful in assisting the decision to use and develop an appropriate threshold for one's own setting. Due to the nature of the study design, the findings will be prone to confounding effect and biases; therefore, the analyses will be adjusted for potential confounders and statistical methods will be explored to minimize biases. Knowledge gained from the study will be conveyed to the public through various disseminations such as reports, policy briefs, academic journals, and presentations."
https://openalex.org/W4300690057,"Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic Gram-negative organisms prevalent in nearly all habitats. A detailed proteomics study of Cyanobacteria has not been conducted despite extensive study of their genome sequences. Therefore, we conducted a proteome-wide analysis of the Cyanobacteria proteome and found Calothrix desertica as the largest (680331.825 kDa) and Candidatus synechococcus spongiarum as the smallest (42726.77 kDa) proteome of the cyanobacterial kingdom. A Cyanobacterial proteome encodes 312.018 amino acids per protein, with a molecular weight of 182173.1324 kDa per proteome. The isoelectric point (pI) of the Cyanobacterial proteome ranges from 2.13 to 13.32. It was found that the Cyanobacterial proteome encodes a greater number of acidic-pI proteins, and their average pI is 6.437. The proteins with higher pI are likely to contain repetitive amino acids. A virtual 2D map of Cyanobacterial proteome showed a bimodal distribution of molecular weight and pI. Several proteins within the Cyanobacterial proteome were found to encode Selenocysteine (Sec) amino acid, while Pyrrolysine amino acids were not detected. The study can enable us to generate a high-resolution cell map to monitor proteomic dynamics. Through this computational analysis, we can gain a better understanding of the bias in codon usage by analyzing the amino acid composition of the Cyanobacterial proteome."

There are no evidence-based withdrawal treatments, and no medication is approved for the treatment of MA withdrawal. Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) dimesilate, used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and binge eating disorder has the potential as an agonist therapy to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms, and improve outcomes for patients.A single arm, open-label pilot study to test the safety and feasibility of LDX for the treatment of MA withdrawal. Participants will be inpatients in a drug and alcohol withdrawal unit, and will receive a tapering dose of LDX over five days: 250mg LDX on Day 1, reducing by 50mg per day to 50mg on Day 5. Optional inpatient Days 6 and 7 will allow for participants to transition to ongoing treatment. Participants will be followed-up on Days 14, 21 and 28. All participants will also receive standard inpatient withdrawal care. The primary outcomes are safety (measured by adverse events, changes in vital signs, changes in suicidality and psychosis) and feasibility (the time taken to enrol the sample, proportion of screen / pre-screen failures). Secondary outcomes are acceptability (treatment satisfaction questionnaire, medication adherence, concomitant medications, qualitative interviews), retention to protocol (proportion retained to primary and secondary endpoints), changes in withdrawal symptoms (Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionnaire) and craving for MA (visual analogue scale), and sleep outcomes (continuous actigraphy and daily sleep diary).This is the first study to assess lisdexamfetamine for the treatment of acute MA withdrawal.

In the linear case, we show, under a large set of cost structures, that substantial differentiation exists and is stable. In the quadratic case, maximum differentiation is the only equilibrium for all cost structures in the model but firms' profits are higher than in the original case. We also consider the case where customers transportation costs are quadratic while firms logistics costs are linear."
https://openalex.org/W4300690377,"Soil erosion has a severe impact on habitat and productivity. It is considered to be a major environmental threat prevalent in ecosystems. However, few researchers have studied the spatial distribution of soil erosion intensity among different geographic environmental factors. The Qin River Basin is a geographical unit consisting of mountains, hills, and plains with significant regional characteristics, and it has a basin area of 14,810.91 km2. This study uses the Geographical Information Systems, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in the soil-erosion intensity in the Qin River Basin from 1990 to 2018. Different environmental factors of land use, slope and altitude on erosion intensities of 19 secondary land types were analyzed. It can better reflect the soil erosion under different environmental factors and different land use types. Results show that the soil erosion modulus of Qin River Basin were 10.25 t hm-2 a-1, and it belong to slight erosion from 1990 to 2018. Soil erosion intensity is greater in grassland and woodland than in cropland. The strongest soil erosion occurred in the sparse forestland, and the lowest was in beach land. Soil erosion was the highest for a slope of 15~25° and an altitude of 1200~1500 m. Rainfall and slope are important factors lead to soil erosion, indicating weak water and soil conservation implemented in these areas. Therefore, priority should be given to these geomorphic units to formulate and implement soil-erosion control and ecological restoration policies in the Qin River Basin. This study provides a good reference for preventing and controlling soil erosion in river basins."
https://openalex.org/W4300690614,"Purpose Little is known about the associations between mild intellectual disability (MID), borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) and aggressive behaviour in general mental health care. The study aims to establish the association between aggressive behaviour and MID/BIF, analysing patient characteristics and diagnoses. Method 1174 out of 1565 consecutive in-and outpatients were screened for MID/BIF with the Screener for Intelligence and Learning Disabilities (SCIL) in general mental health care in The Netherlands. During treatment, aggressive behaviour was assessed with the Staff Observation Aggression Scale-Revised (SOAS-R). We calculated odds ratios and performed a logistic and poisson regression to calculate the associations of MID/ BIF, patient characteristics and diagnoses with the probability of aggression. Results Forty-one percent of participating patients were screened positive for MID/BIF. Patients with assumed MID/BIF showed significantly more aggression at the patient and sample level (odds ratio (OR) of 2.50 for aggression and 2.52 for engaging in outwardly directed physical aggression). The proportion of patients engaging in 2–5 repeated aggression incidents was higher in assumed MID (OR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.82–4.95) and MID/BIF (OR = 4.20, 95% CI 2.45–7.22). Logistic regression showed that patients who screened positive for BIF (OR 2,0 95% CL 1.26–3.17), MID (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.87–4.46), had a bipolar disorder (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.79–5.28), schizophrenia (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.80–4.19), and younger age (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.15–2.50), were more likely to have engaged in any aggression. Poisson regression underlined these findings, showing a SCIL of 15 and below (β = 0.61, p&lt;0.001) was related to more incidents. Conclusions We found an increased risk for aggression and physical aggression in patients with assumed MID/BIF. We recommend screening for intellectual functioning at the start of treatment and using measures to prevent and manage aggressive behaviour that fits patients with MID/BIF."
https://openalex.org/W4300690840,"Investigating the chemical diversity of natural products from tropical environments is an inspiring approach to developing new drug candidates for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). In the present study, phenotypic screenings for antiprotozoal activity and a combination of computational and biological approaches enabled the identification and characterization of four cytochalasins, which are fungal metabolites from Brazilian biodiversity sources. Cytochalasins A-D exhibited IC50 values ranging from 2 to 20 μM against intracellular Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum amastigotes, values comparable to those of the standard drugs benznidazole and miltefosine for Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, respectively. Furthermore, cytochalasins A-D reduced L. infantum infections by more than 80% in THP-1 cells, most likely due to the inhibition of phagocytosis by interactions with actin. Molecular modelling studies have provided useful insights into the mechanism of action of this class of compounds. Furthermore, cytochalasins A-D showed moderate cytotoxicity against normal cell lines (HFF-1, THP-1, and HepG2) and a good overall profile for oral bioavailability assessed in vitro. The results of this study support the use of natural products from Brazilian biodiversity sources to find potential drug candidates for two of the most important NTDs."
https://openalex.org/W4300688008,"This study evaluated in 2019-2021 the use of willow chips for compost production and its effect on Sinapis alba L. germination index and seedling growth. Peatlands and peat are of very important economic but above all environmental significance. The conservation of peatland resources is one of the most crucial future challenges. Composts and other forms of lignin-cellulosic biomass are potentially the best renewable alternative to peat in its economic use. Composted lignin-cellulosic biomass can replace peat and be used as a substrate for vegetable transplant production. The impact of modifying the willow lignin-cellulosic biomass composting process has not been well analysed. A compost experiment with willow biomass was conducted to study its effect on selected compost indexes (particle size structure in %, bulk density (kg m-3), and total nitrogen content). The quality assessment of the willow composts was determined after six months of composting process based on the N content and morphological characteristics of tested plant in vegetative chamber. Sinapis alba L. was germinated on a water extract made from willow compost using the following additives to willow biomasses: W0-without additives, WN-with the addition of nitrogen, WF-with the addition of mycelium, WNF-with the addition of nitrogen and mycelium. During the composting process, samples were taken after each mixing of the biomass pile to assess their maturity through the use of a bioassay. Willow biomass did not have a negative effect on biological evaluation parameters, and in some indicators, such as the length of embryonic roots in the VI period of the measurements, it was stimulating (61-84% longer in W0 and WF than in the control). The addition of nitrogen during the composting process, especially in the initial composting period, had a strong inhibitory effect."

Studies investigating the interplay of alexithymia and affective experiences in determining sleep quality have yielded mixed results. To disentangle the inconsistency, this study examined the concurrent predictive power of alexithymia, and negative and positive affect, while incorporating interoceptive sensibility (IS) as a possible moderator.A sample of 224 (70.10% were female) participants completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), and Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (for controlling response bias) using paper and pencil. A two-stage cluster analysis of the MAIA was used to capture IS characteristics. Stepwise regression was conducted separately for each IS cluster.A three-group structure for IS characteristics was found. Higher alexithymia was predictive of poor sleep quality in the low IS group, while higher negative affect predicted poor sleep quality in the moderate and high IS groups. Additionally, alexithymia and positive affect were significantly different in the three IS groups, while negative affect and sleep quality were not.Emotion and cognitive arousal may impact sleep quality differently in individuals with different levels of internal focusing ability, depending on physiological versus emotional self-conceptualization. The implications on pathological research, clinical intervention, study limitations and future directions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4300688825,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a geographically expanding, fatal neurodegenerative disease in cervids. The disease can be transmitted directly (animal-animal) or indirectly via infectious prions shed into the environment. The precise mechanisms of indirect CWD transmission are unclear but known sources of the infectious prions that contaminate the environment include saliva, urine and feces. We have previously identified PrPC expression in deer interdigital glands, sac-like exocrine structures located between the digits of the hooves. In this study, we assayed for CWD prions within the interdigital glands of CWD infected deer to determine if they could serve as a source of prion shedding and potentially contribute to CWD transmission. Immunohistochemical analysis of interdigital glands from a CWD-infected female mule deer identified disease-associated PrPCWD within clusters of infiltrating leukocytes adjacent to sudoriferous and sebaceous glands, and within the acrosyringeal epidermis of a sudoriferous gland tubule. Proteinase K-resistant PrPCWD material was amplified by serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) from soil retrieved from between the hoof digits of a clinically affected mule deer. Blinded testing of interdigital glands from 11 mule deer by real-time quake-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) accurately identified CWD-infected animals. The data described suggests that interdigital glands may play a role in the dissemination of CWD prions into the environment, warranting future investigation."

It has been demonstrated that the primary molecular determinant of virulence phenotype is located in the 5' UTR of the viral genome. Translation initiation of CVB3 RNA is directed by the IRES element situated in the 5'UTR. In the present study, we analyse the effects of single point mutations introduced in different positions in the domain V of the IRES RNA of CVB3 wild type. We characterize in vitro virus replicative capacitiy and translation efficiency and we test in vivo virulence of different CVB3 mutants produced by the introduction of different mutations in the domain V of IRES by site-directed mutagenesis to abolish its structure. Our results demonstrate that all RNA mutants display different levels of decreased replication and translation initiation efficiency in vitro. The translation defect was correlated with significant reduced viral titer of mutant particles in comparison with the wild type. When inoculated in mice, mutant viruses were checked for inflammation and necrosis.In vitro and in vivo Findings strongly suggest that the most attenuated mutant strain could be considered a candidate for live-attenuated CVB3 vaccine."

This paper tests a number of proposed hypotheses to illustrate patterns of influence generated by economic and social globalization on perceived social distance relative to immigrants. The European Union (EU) constitutes an ideal study case as its Member States vary in exposure to globalization and attract immigrants from different countries of origin. We conduct a multilevel analysis combining individual level variables from Eurobarometer's recent dataset collected in 2017 and country-level variables from KOF of Globalization Index and other major sources. The results show that individuals in countries with higher degrees of social globalization have lower levels of social distance toward immigrants, while relative level of economic globalization has scant influence. Contact factors are also evaluated for their potential effects. Both casual and close contacts, as specified, reduce social distance. This study contributes to migration studies by offering a clearer specification of how social, rather than economic, globalization interact with contact factors to decrease one's perceived distance from immigrants in the EU."

This is a retrospective cohort study and the analysis was conducted on SARS death records between 02/16/2020 and 04/17/2021, obtained from the Information System for the Epidemiological Surveillance of Influenza (Sistema de Informação da Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe, SIVEP-Gripe). Pregnant and postpartum women, aged between 10 and 55 years, who died from SARS, were included and classified into two groups: SARS due to confirmed COVID-19 or SARS due to nonspecific cause. The cases were analyzed according to the women’s demographic and epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, risk factors and disease evolution. As results, 19,333 pregnant and postpartum women were identified. From these, 1,279 died (1,026 deaths from COVID-19 and 253 deaths from SARS with nonspecific cause). The groups showed significant differences in age, education, race, and occurrence of obesity and chronic lung disease. The group of women who died from confirmed COVID-19 presented a significantly higher frequency of symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, loss of taste, and loss of smell, as well as a higher rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Data analysis draws attention to the high number of cases of SARS without a causal diagnosis, the low access to ICU and orotracheal intubation (OTI), which might be explained by the demographic and regional inequalities in the access to healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W4300689938,"Ranking user reputation and object quality in online rating systems is of great significance for the construction of reputation systems. In this paper we put forward an iterative algorithm for ranking reputation and quality in terms of eigenvector, named EigenRank algorithm, where the user reputation and object quality interact and the user reputation converges to the eigenvector associated to the greatest eigenvalue of a certain matrix. In addition, we prove the convergence of EigenRank algorithm, and analyse the speed of convergence. Meanwhile, the experimental results for the synthetic networks show that the AUC values and Kendall's τ of the EigenRank algorithm are greater than the ones from the IBeta method and Vote Aggregation method with different proportions of random/malicious ratings. The results for the empirical networks show that the EigenRank algorithm performs better in accuracy and robustness compared to the IBeta method and Vote Aggregation method in the random and malicious rating attack cases. This work provides an expectable ranking algorithm for the online user reputation identification."

When symptoms persist for over 12 weeks following the initial infection, and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis, the term post-COVID-19 syndrome is used, or the patient-defined term of Long Covid. Understanding the lived experiences of Long Covid is crucial to supporting its management. However, research on patient experiences of Long Covid is currently not ethnically diverse enough. The study aim is to explore the lived experience of Long Covid, using qualitative interviews and art-based methods, among people from ethnically diverse backgrounds (in the UK), to better understand wider systems of support and healthcare support needs. Co-created artwork will be used to build on the interview findings. A purposive sampling strategy will be used to gain diverse experiences of Long Covid, sampling by demographics, geographic locations and experiences of Long Covid. Individuals (aged >18 years) from Black and ethnic minority backgrounds, who self-report Long Covid symptoms, will be invited to take part in a semi-structured interview. Interviews will be analysed thematically. A sub-sample of participants will be invited to co-create visual artwork to further explore shared narratives of Long Covid, enhance storytelling and increase understanding about the condition. A patient advisory group, representing diversity in ethnicity and experiences of Long Covid, will inform all research stages. Stakeholder workshops with healthcare professionals and persons, systems or networks important to people's management of Long Covid, will advise on the integration of findings to inform management of Long Covid. The study will use patient narratives from people from diverse ethnic backgrounds, to raise awareness of Long Covid and help inform management of Long Covid and how wider social systems and networks may inform better healthcare service access and experiences."
https://openalex.org/W4300690527,"Introduction Although several non-pharmacological interventions have been tested in the management of Fibromyalgia (FM), there is little consensus regarding the best options for the treatment of this health condition. The purpose of this network meta-analysis (NMA) is to investigate the comparative efficacy and acceptability of non-pharmacological interventions for FM, in order to assist clinical decision making through a ranking of interventions in relation to the most important clinical outcomes in these patients. Methods and analysis We will perform a systematic search to identify randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions endorsed in guidelines and systematic reviews. Information sources searched will include major bibliographic databases without language or date restrictions (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO and PEDro). Our primary outcomes will be pain intensity, patient-reported quality of life (QoL), and acceptability of treatment will be our secondary outcome. Risk of bias of the included trials will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2). For each pairwise comparison between the different interventions, we will present mean differences (MDs) for pain intensity and QoL outcomes and Relative Risks (RRs) for acceptability, both with respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Initially, standard pairwise meta-analyses will be performed using a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model for all comparisons with at least two trials and then we will perform a frequentist NMA using the methodology of multivariate meta-analysis assuming a common heterogeneity parameter, using the mvmeta command and network suite in STATA. In the NMA, two different types of control group, such as placebo/sham and no intervention/waiting list will be combined as one node called “Control”. The competing interventions will be ranked using the P-score, which is the frequentist analogue of surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for the outcomes of interest at immediate- (intervention duration of up to 2 weeks), short- (over 2 weeks up to 12 weeks) and long-terms (over 12 weeks). The confidence in the results from NMA will be assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta‐analysis (CINeMA) framework. Ethics and dissemination This work synthesises evidence from previously published studies and does not require ethics review or approval. A manuscript describing the findings will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

https://openalex.org/W4300690528,"Objective The objective of this study was to assess risk perception, community myths, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 among community in Southeast Ethiopia, 2020. Methods Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 854 participants selected using a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from previous literature. Descriptive statistics were done to summarize the variables. A generalized linear model with binary logistic specification was used to identify factors associated with risk perception and practice. Accordingly adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and those with p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered as significant factors associated with risk perception and practice. Cluster analysis using a linear mixed model was performed to identify factors associated with community myth and those with p-value &lt;0.05 were reported as significant factors associated with community myth. Results All 854 respondents gave their answer yielding 100% response rate. Of these 547 (64.1%) were male, 611 (71.5%) were rural residents, 534 (62.5%) got information about COVID-19 from TV/radio, 591 (69.2%) of them live near health facility, 265 (30.8%) have a history of substance use and 100 (11.7%) have a history of chronic illness, and 415 (48.6%) of them have a high-risk perception, 428 (50.1%) have a wrong myth about COVID-19 and 366 (42.9%) have poor practice respectively. Residence, distances from health facility and myths were significantly associated with risk perception. Occupation, knowledge, and practice were significantly associated with community myths. Also level of education, living near health facilities, having good knowledge and wrong myth were significantly associated with the practice of utilizing COVID-19 preventive respectively. Conclusion The study found high-risk perception, high wrong community myth, and relatively low utilization of available practices towards COVID-19 and factors associated with them."

The structure of SOR from Acidianus ambivalens (7X9W) was determined at 2.78 Å resolution. The active site of each subunit inside the central nanocompartment is composed of Fe3+ coordinated to two water molecules and the three amino acids (H86, H90 and E114). Second, we determined the structure of Lumazine Synthase (LS) from Aquifex aeolicus (7X7M) at 2.33 Å resolution. LS forms a cage-like structure consisting of 60 identical subunits each of MW ≃ 15 kDa arranged in a strict icosahedral symmetry. The LS subunits are interconnected by ion-pair network. Due to their thermostability and relatively easy purification scheme, both SOR and LS can serve as a model for the catalytic and structural characterization of biocatalysts as well as a benchmark for cryo-EM sample preparation, optimization of the acquisition parameters and 3D reconstruction."

During the visits public health nurses and physicians follow-up the growth and development of the child, evaluate the welfare of the family, give health counselling and vaccinate the children. The aim of this study was to measure the time used by the nurses and physicians for different tasks during the visits and evaluate the costs of preventive health care procedures. Special emphasis was on time and costs used for administering vaccinations. The study was conducted in four CHCs. Trained observers measured the time used for predefined tasks with a stopwatch application operating on a tablet computer. Labour costs of visits and vaccinations were evaluated by using the gross average salary costs of health care personnel. Time used for vaccine logistics and other administrative tasks was obtained by interviewing the nurses in charge of the vaccine logistics at each CHC. Altogether 325 CHC visits of children <13 months were followed. Public health nurse used for a visit in average 49 (range 12-101) minutes, and the corresponding labour costs were 17 (4-35) Euros. Vaccines were administered at 183 visits. Children got on average 2.4 (1-4) vaccine doses per visit. The observed time used for vaccinations was 10.2 (1.6-25) minutes and the costs 3.58 (0.57-8.62) Euros per visit. The observed time included guidance, preparation, administration, and documentation of vaccinations. Adding one dose into a visit increased the time spent on vaccination on average 2.8 minutes (0.99 Euros). The mean non-observed time used for vaccine logistics outside the visits was 3.4 minutes and cost 1.19 Euros per dose. Administering of the vaccines of the Finnish vaccination programme is relatively simple and inexpensive because Finnish children have regular scheduled visits to CHCs."
https://openalex.org/W4300690945,"Shear-induced platelet activation (SIPAct) is an important mechanism of thrombosis initiation under high blood flow. This mechanism relies on the interaction of platelets with the von Willebrand factor (VWF) capable of unfolding under high shear stress. High shear stress occurs in the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) commonly used for haemodialysis. A novel patient-specific approach for the modelling of SIPAct in the AVF was proposed. This enabled us to estimate the SIPAct level via computational fluid dynamics. The suggested approach was applied for the SIPAct analysis in AVF geometries reconstructed from medical images. The approach facilitates the determination of the SIPAct level dependence on both biomechanical (AVF flow rate) and biochemical factors (VWF multimer size). It was found that the dependence of the SIPAct level on the AVF flow rate can be approximated by a power law. The critical flow rate was a decreasing function of the VWF multimer size. Moreover, the critical AVF flow rate highly depended on patient-specific factors, e.g., the vessel geometry. This indicates that the approach may be adopted to elucidate patient-specific thrombosis risk factors in haemodialysis patients."

This study aimed to analyze the effects of solid matrix priming (SMP) on cauliflower and broccoli seed germination and early seedling growth under suboptimal temperature conditions. The SMP method used in this study included the following steps: (1) mixing seeds with vermiculite and water at a ratio of 2:3:2.5 (w/w/v) and incubating for 2 days in the dark at 20°C; (2) drying the SM-primed seed; (3) germinating the SM-primed and the nonprimed seeds at 10, 15, 20, and 25°C; (4) analyzing the antioxidant enzyme activities of SM-primed and nonprimed germinating broccoli and cauliflower seeds in the early germination stage at 10, 15, 20, and 25°C; and (5) testing the emergence of SM-primed and nonprimed control seeds in the early spring glasshouse. The results showed that the SMP improved seed germination vigor and early seedling growth and increased the activities of peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase in the germinating cauliflower and broccoli seeds under the suboptimal temperature conditions in the early germination stage compared with nonprimed seeds. It was observed that the suboptimal temperature conditions (i.e., 10 and 15°C) suppressed SM-primed and nonprimed seed germination and early seedling growth of cauliflower and broccoli. Inside a greenhouse, the SMP improved the emergence of cauliflower and broccoli seeds during the early spring season. SMP is an effective method for improving seed germination and the emergence of cauliflower and broccoli under suboptimal temperature conditions."
