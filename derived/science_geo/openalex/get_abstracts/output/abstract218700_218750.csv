https://openalex.org/W2022619320,"The papilloma, polyoma, and vacuolating agents seem to form a natural group of tumor viruses, for which the name papova virus group is proposed. Members of the group have the following properties: 45 mmicro diameter, deoxyribonucleic acid core, 42 capsomeres, absence of essential lipids, thermal resistance, slow growth cycle with multiplication within the cell nucleus, and tumorigenicity."

https://openalex.org/W1996079814,"A technique for the chronic infusion of mice is presented. Infusion of tritiated thymidine for 3 to 7 days labels most, but not all, of the cells of autochthonous breast tumors. Many of the unlabeled tumor cells are probably nonproliferating, but some may represent cells with exceptionally long intermitotic times."

After they were released from their cages, they had greater difficulty than normally reared littermates in performing a simple black-white discrimination and in subsequent reversal training."
https://openalex.org/W2053253458,The stimulation of mating behavior by means of the stereotaxic introduction of small implants of solid C(14)-diethylstilbestrol di-n-butyrate to the hypothalamus of ovariectomized cats is described. Autoradiographic examination of the brains of mating animals reveals that certain neurons in the region of these implants show a selective affinity for labeled estrogen.
https://openalex.org/W2088945669,"THE Technicon autoanalyser (Technicon, Ltd., Chertsey, Surrey), in combination with a fluorimeter (The Locarte Co., Ltd., London), has been adapted for the estimation of adrenaline and noradrenaline by a modification of a trihydroxyindole method1. The technique has been mainly applied to the analysis of blood and tissue extracts after initial purification by adsorption on alumina and elution with dilute acetic acid."

https://openalex.org/W100925835,"The enzyme used was a salt-free, twice crystallized sample of cu-chymotrypsin supplied by the Sigma Chemical Company. The methyl ester of hydrocinnamic acid (3-phenylpropionic acid) was prepared by refluxing 5 g of the acid with 750 ml of Fisher’s chemically pure methanol and a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 days. The excess of methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was extracted with ether. The ether was washed with 10 100 ml portions of 5% sodium bicarbonate. The ether was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the ester was distilled under reduced pressure, the middle 30% being collected. The boiling poin$ was 236-237” at atmospheric pressure. The methyl hippurate was prepared by heating a mixture of hippuric acid in the presence of a large excess of methanol to 190” under an atmosphere of hydrogen at approximately 2500 pounds per square inch (3). After subsequent purification, the melting point was 82-83”. The concentration of the enzyme was approximately 1"

https://openalex.org/W2049538039,The evidence for a 42 capsomere structure for the capsid of the papova viruses and 92 for reovirus and woundtumor viruses is corroborated. Some of the difficulties inherent in comparing large-scale icosahedral models with high-resolution electron micrographs of virus particles displaying cubic symmetry are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2045290263,"THE concentration of red cells is not the same in all parts of the circulatory system1, the cell plasma ratio being lower in the capillaries and small vessels than in the larger arteries and veins. The over-all cell percentage (body hæmatocrit) is determined from the direct measurement of both red cell volume and plasma volume, and from this the body/venous hæmatocrit ratio (BH/VH ratio) is calculated. In normal adults resident at sea-level the BH/VH ratio averages 0.91 (ref. 2)."

https://openalex.org/W2051346026,"DURING investigations on the water-soluble proteins of barley grain we have found that a few days standing has pronounced favourable effects on the extracts. While standing a small precipitate is formed. This precipitate contains only about 3 per cent of the total protein in the extract. Paper-electrophoreses of fresh extracts after 1–2 h extraction time are very blurred. After 2–7 days standing electrophoresis shows a good separation of eight fractions1. The fresh extracts also yield irreversible precipitates on ammonium sulphate fractionation, dialysis against water or freeze drying. After some days standing no irreversible precipitation occurs."

https://openalex.org/W2084958415,"SO far as we are aware, no measurements relating to the stability of clinical dextran solutions kept for several years have been published. Two dextran solutions made in the United States, A and B, and two made in Great Britain, C and D, were examined in 1954, and again after storage for 5 yr. at 4° C. Where applicable the methods of testing described in the British Pharmacopœia1 were used. The optical rotation of each dextran was determined and used in calculating the concentrations of solutions for the viscosity measurements (Table 1). Dextran D had undergone the most change; the changes in the others were relatively small."
