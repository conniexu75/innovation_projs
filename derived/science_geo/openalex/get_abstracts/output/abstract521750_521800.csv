Qiu et al. take this to new lengths through precise selection of longer polymer blocks that self-assemble through a crystallization process (see the Perspective by Lee et al. ). They chose polymer blocks that were either hydrophobic or polar and used miscible solvents that were each ideal for only one of the blocks. Their triblock comicelles generated a wide variety of stable three-dimensional superstructures through side-by-side stacking and end-to-end intermicellar association.

For the health of the organism as a whole, it is important that only healthy stem cells be used. Mohrin et al. elucidated a regulatory branch of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response that is coupled to cellular energy metabolism and proliferation in stem cells (see the Perspective by Ocampo and Belmonte). Mitochondrial protein folding stress triggered a metabolic checkpoint that regulates the cell cycle. Deregulation of this pathway interfered with stem cell quiescence and compromised regenerative function. Science , this issue p. 1374 ; see also p. 1319"

Upsetting this balance leads to autoimmunity. Regulatory T cells (T regs ), are a subset of immune cells that help to maintain this balance. Yang et al. found that murine T reg cells generated very early in life are distinct from those generated in older animals and play an especially important role in keeping autoimmunity in check (see the Perspective by Tanaka and Sakaguchi). These changes are due to differences in the way T regs develop in the thymus in newborn versus adult mice. Science , this issue p. 589 ; see also p. 506"

Sada et al. wanted to develop compounds to treat drug-resistant epilepsy (see the Perspective by Scharfman). They focused on a metabolic pathway in the brain, the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle. They found that lactate dehydrogenase, a key molecule in nerve cell metabolism, controls brain excitability. Searching for a substance that selectively targets this molecule, they found a potential anti-epileptic drug that strongly suppressed drug-resistant epilepsy in an animal model.

When and where ribosomes encounter mRNAs can regulate gene expression. Halstead et al. developed an RNA biosensor that allows single molecules of mRNAs that have never been translated to be distinguished from ones that have undergone translation by the ribosome in living cells (see the Perspective by Popp and Maquat). The authors demonstrated the utility of their technique by examining the spatial and temporal regulation of translation in single cells and in Drosophila oocytes during development.

https://openalex.org/W2169986172,"Cigarette smoke (CS)-induced cellular senescence is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The molecular mechanism by which CS induces cellular senescence is unknown. Here, we show that CS stress (exposure of primary lung cells to CS extract 0.2-0.75% with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of ∼0.5%) led to impaired mitophagy and perinuclear accumulation of damaged mitochondria associated with cellular senescence in both human lung fibroblasts and small airway epithelial cells (SAECs). Impaired mitophagy was attributed to reduced Parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria, which was due to CS-induced cytoplasmic p53 accumulation and its interaction with Parkin. Impaired Parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria was also observed in mouse lungs with emphysema (6 months CS exposure, 100 mg TPM/m(3)) as well as in lungs of chronic smokers and patients with COPD. Primary SAECs from patients with COPD also exhibited impaired mitophagy and increased cellular senescence via suborganellar signaling. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (Mito-Tempo) restored impaired mitophagy, decreased mitochondrial mass accumulation, and delayed cellular senescence in Parkin-overexpressing cells. In conclusion, defective mitophagy leads to CS stress-induced lung cellular senescence, and restoring mitophagy delays cellular senescence, which provides a promising therapeutic intervention in chronic airway diseases."

Comets are some of the most ancient bodies in the solar system and should contain the nitrogen compounds that were abundant when they formed. Using the ROSINA mass spectrometer aboard the Rosetta spacecraft orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Rubin et al. found molecular nitrogen at levels that are depleted compared to those in the primordial solar system. Depletion of such a magnitude suggests that the comet formed either from the low-temperature agglomeration of pristine amorphous water ice grains or from clathrates. Science , this issue p. 232"

https://openalex.org/W3023050740,"Following the early discovery of stripe-like order in La-based copper-oxide superconductors, charge ordering instabilities were observed in all cuprate families. However, it has proven difficult to distinguish between uni- (stripes) and bi-directional (checkerboard) charge order in Y- and Bi-based materials. Here we use resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) to measure the two-dimensional structure factor in YBCO, in reciprocal space. Our data reveal the presence of charge stripe order, i.e. locally unidirectional density waves, suggesting it as the true microscopic nature of charge modulations in cuprates. At the same time, we find that the well-established competition between charge order and superconductivity is stronger for charge correlations across than along the stripes, which provides additional evidence for the intrinsic unidirectional nature of the charge order."

By this means, Emmrich et al. found that individual copper and iron atoms formed toroidal structures on a copper surface. These shapes arise from the electrostatic attractions in the center of the atoms and Pauli repulsions at their edges. Individual atoms within clusters have underlying surface symmetry and can bind to different surface sites as clusters form. Science , this issue p. 308"
https://openalex.org/W2008817720,"Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (also known as gastro-resistant dimethyl fumarate), an oral therapeutic containing dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as the active ingredient, is currently approved for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. DMF is also a component in a distinct mixture product with 3 different salts of monoethyl fumarate (MEF), which is marketed for the treatment of psoriasis. Previous studies have provided insight into the pharmacologic properties of DMF, including modulation of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) pathway, and glutathione (GSH) modulation; however, those of MEF remain largely unexplored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effects of DMF and MEF on KEAP1 modification, activation of the NRF2 pathway, and GSH conjugation. Using mass spectrometry, DMF treatment resulted in a robust modification of specific cysteine residues on KEAP1. In comparison, the overall degree of KEAP1 modification following MEF treatment was significantly less or undetectable. Consistent with KEAP1 cysteine modification, DMF treatment resulted in nuclear translocation of NRF2 and a robust transcriptional response in treated cells, as did MEF; however, the responses to MEF were of a lower magnitude or distinct compared to DMF. DMF was also shown to produce an acute concentration-dependent depletion of GSH; however, GSH levels eventually recovered and rose above baseline by 24 hours. In contrast, MEF did not cause acute reductions in GSH, but did produce an increase by 24 hours. Overall, these studies demonstrate that DMF and MEF are both pharmacologically active, but have differing degrees of activity as well as unique actions. These differences would be expected to result in divergent effects on downstream biology."
https://openalex.org/W2020233555,"RNA kinetics may define regulatory hierarchy The double-helical structure of DNA suggests immediately how nucleic acid polymers can recognize and bind to homologous sequences. Target recognition by RNA is vital in many biological processes. Fei et al. used super-resolution microscopy of tagged RNAs and computer modeling to understand how RNA-RNA base-pairing reactions occur in vivo. They studied a small RNA (sRNA) that targets a messenger RNA (mRNA) for degradation in bacteria. They observed a slow rate of association as the sRNA searched for its mRNA target, but thereafter a fast rate of dissociation. This explains the need for high concentrations of sRNA to cause mRNA degradation. The sRNA found different target mRNAs at different rates, allowing the generation of a regulatory hierarchy.

Sunspots change over an 11-year time scale, which depends on the behavior of the probable magnetic dynamo within.

Their mathematical reasoning explains why the polar field activity can predict the sunspot cycle. Science , this issue p. 1333"
https://openalex.org/W1984543781,"Despite different aetiologies, most inherited retinal disorders culminate in photoreceptor loss, which induces concomitant changes in the neural retina, one of the most striking being reactive gliosis by Müller cells. It is typically assumed that photoreceptor loss leads to an upregulation of glial fibrilliary acidic protein (Gfap) and other intermediate filament proteins, together with other gliosis-related changes, including loss of integrity of the outer limiting membrane (OLM) and deposition of proteoglycans. However, this is based on a mix of both injury-induced and genetic causes of photoreceptor loss. There are very few longitudinal studies of gliosis in the retina and none comparing these changes across models over time. Here, we present a comprehensive spatiotemporal assessment of features of gliosis in the degenerating murine retina that involves Müller glia. Specifically, we assessed Gfap, vimentin and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG) levels and outer limiting membrane (OLM) integrity over time in four murine models of inherited photoreceptor degeneration that encompass a range of disease severities (Crb1rd8/rd8, Prph2+/Δ307, Rho-/-, Pde6brd1/rd1). These features underwent very different changes, depending upon the disease-causing mutation, and that these changes are not correlated with disease severity. Intermediate filament expression did indeed increase with disease progression in Crb1rd8/rd8 and Prph2+/Δ307, but decreased in the Prph2+/Δ307 and Pde6brd1/rd1 models. CSPG deposition usually, but not always, followed the trends in intermediate filament expression. The OLM adherens junctions underwent significant remodelling in all models, but with differences in the composition of the resulting junctions; in Rho-/- mice, the adherens junctions maintained the typical rod-Müller glia interactions, while in the Pde6brd1/rd1 model they formed predominantly between Müller cells in late stage of degeneration. Together, these results show that gliosis and its associated processes are variable and disease-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2042832353,"Protonation of methane (CH4), a rather rigid molecule well described by quantum mechanics, produces CH5(+), a prototypical floppy molecule that has eluded definitive spectroscopic description. Experimental measurement of high-resolution spectra of pure CH5(+) samples poses a formidable challenge. By applying two types of action spectroscopy predicated on photoinduced reaction with CO2 and photoinhibition of helium cluster growth, we obtained low-temperature, high-resolution spectra of mass-selected CH5(+). On the basis of the very high accuracy of the line positions, we determined a spectrum of combination differences. Analysis of this spectrum enabled derivation of equally accurate ground state-level schemes of the corresponding nuclear spin isomers of CH5(+), as well as tentative quantum number assignment of this enfant terrible of molecular spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1980145630,"Objectives The objective of the present study is to assess the performance of a high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA test with individual HPV-16/HPV-18 genotyping as a method for primary cervical cancer screening compared with liquid-based cytology (LBC) in a population of Greek women taking part in routine cervical cancer screening. Methods The study, conducted by the “HEllenic Real life Multicentric cErvical Screening” (HERMES) study group, involved the recruitment of 4,009 women, aged 25–55, who took part in routine cervical screening at nine Gynecology Departments in Greece. At first visit cervical specimens were collected for LBC and HPV testing using the Roche Cobas 4800 system. Women found positive for either cytology or HPV were referred for colposcopy, whereas women negative for both tests will be retested after three years. The study is ongoing and the results of the first screening round are reported herein. Results Valid results for cytology and HPV testing were obtained for 3,993 women. The overall prevalence of HR-HPV was 12.7%, of HPV-16 2.7% and of HPV-18 1.4%. Of those referred for colposcopy, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) was detected in 41 women (1.07%). At the threshold of CIN2+, cytology [atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or worse] and HPV testing showed a sensitivity of 53.7% and 100% respectively, without change between age groups. Cytology and HPV testing showed specificity of 96.8% and 90.3% respectively, which was increased in older women (≥30) in comparison to younger ones (25–29). Genotyping for HPV16/18 had similar accuracy to cytology for the detection of CIN2+ (sensitivity: 58.5%; specificity 97.5%) as well as for triage to colposcopy (sensitivity: 58.5% vs 53.7% for cytology). Conclusion HPV testing has much better sensitivity than cytology to identify high-grade cervical lesions with slightly lower specificity. HPV testing with individual HPV-16/HPV-18 genotyping could represent a more accurate methodology for primary cervical cancer screening in comparison to liquid-based cytology, especially in older women."

https://openalex.org/W2078565740,"Mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70) mediates essential functions for mitochondrial biogenesis, like import and folding of proteins. In these processes, the chaperone cooperates with cochaperones, the presequence translocase, and other chaperone systems. The chaperonin Hsp60, together with its cofactor Hsp10, catalyzes folding of a subset of mtHsp70 client proteins. Hsp60 forms heptameric ring structures that provide a cavity for protein folding. How the Hsp60 rings are assembled is poorly understood. In a comprehensive interaction study, we found that mtHsp70 associates with Hsp60 and Hsp10. Surprisingly, mtHsp70 interacts with Hsp10 independently of Hsp60. The mtHsp70-Hsp10 complex binds to the unassembled Hsp60 precursor to promote its assembly into mature Hsp60 complexes. We conclude that coupling to Hsp10 recruits mtHsp70 to mediate the biogenesis of the heptameric Hsp60 rings."
https://openalex.org/W2039926685,"Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) guide nucleotide modifications of cellular RNAs in the nucleus. We previously showed that box C/D snoRNAs from the Rpl13a locus are unexpected mediators of physiologic oxidative stress, independent of their predicted ribosomal RNA modifications. Here we demonstrate that oxidative stress induced by doxorubicin causes rapid cytoplasmic accumulation of the Rpl13a snoRNAs through a mechanism that requires superoxide and a nuclear splice variant of NADPH oxidase. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that box C/D snoRNAs as a class are present in the cytoplasm, where their levels are dynamically regulated by NADPH oxidase. These findings suggest that snoRNAs may orchestrate the response to environmental stress through molecular interactions outside of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2320293853,"Humans can not only perform some visual tasks with great precision, they can also judge how good they are in these tasks. However, it remains unclear how observers produce such metacognitive evaluations, and how these evaluations might be dissociated from the performance in the visual task. Here, we hypothesized that some stimulus variables could affect confidence judgments above and beyond their impact on performance. In a motion categorization task on moving dots, we manipulated the mean and the variance of the motion directions, to obtain a low-mean low-variance condition and a high-mean high-variance condition with matched performances. Critically, in terms of confidence, observers were not indifferent between these two conditions. Observers exhibited marked preferences, which were heterogeneous across individuals, but stable within each observer when assessed one week later. Thus, confidence and performance are dissociable and observers' confidence judgments put different weights on the stimulus variables that limit performance."

Our bioinformatics analyses also identified the specific immunomodulatory genes of the chemokine, IL, TNF, MHC, immunoglobulin-binding Fc receptor, calcium-binding S100, matrix metalloproteinase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, and ion channel families affected in both the P and D segments.

As such, mutations of Crb can cause different forms of cancers. The cell intrinsic role of Crb in cell polarity is governed by its conserved, 37-residue cytoplasmic tail (Crb-CT) via binding to moesin and protein associated with Lin7–1 (PALS1). However, the detailed mechanism governing the Crb·moesin interaction and the balance of Crb in binding to moesin and PALS1 are not well understood. Here we report the 1.5 Å resolution crystal structure of the moesin protein 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM)·Crb-CT complex, revealing that both the canonical FERM binding motif and the postsynaptic density protein-95/Disc large-1/Zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) binding motif of Crb contribute to the Crb·moesin interaction.

Coincidently, the aPKC phosphorylation sites in Crb-CT are located near or within the Crb-FBM (Fig. 1A), implying that the interaction(s) between Crb-FBM and its target(s) may be regulated by aPKC-mediated phosphorylation of Crb-CT.

The autoinhibited ERMs can be activated by phosphorylation on a conserved Thr (Thr-567 in ezrin, Thr-564 in radixin, Thr-558 in moesin) at their respective inhibitory C-terminal domain and/or via binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (34.Hirao M.

The activated ERMs then bind to membranes via their FERM domains (directly to membrane lipids and/or transmembrane proteins) and to actin filaments via their C-terminal actin binding motifs. In Drosophila epithelia, Crb exhibits close co-localization with moesin and stabilizes the apical membrane-cytoskeleton, leading to reinforcement of the zonula adherens and effective coupling between epithelial morphogenesis and cell polarity (25.Médina E. Williams J. Klipfell E. Zarnescu D. Thomas G. Le Bivic A. Crumbs interacts with moesin and β(Heavy)-spectrin in the apical membrane skeleton of Drosophila.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism governing the Crb·moesin interaction and Crb-mediated regulation between apical-basal cell polarity and apical cytoskeleton reorganization are not well understood. Here we biochemically and structurally characterized the interaction between Crb-CT and moesin FERM domain. The 1.5 Å resolution crystal structure of the moesin-FERM·Crb-CT complex reveals a typical FERM/FBM binding mode in which the FBM of Crb-CT forms a short β-strand and fits into the canonical F3 lobe target binding site. To our surprise, the PBM of Crb-CT also contributes to the binding to moesin-FERM by occupying the PIP2 binding site at the F1/F3 cleft, implying that Crb-CT may mimic the role of PIP2 in the activation of the ERM family proteins. We further show by NMR spectroscopy that phosphorylation of Crb-CT by aPKC disrupts the Crb·moesin association, likely by preventing the formation of the β-strand conformation of the Crb-FBM. The biological implications of these findings are discussed. The mouse moesin FERM domain (residues 1–297) and fly Crb-CT (residues 2110–2146) were amplified by PCR using their respective full-length cDNA as the templates. Each PCR product was individually cloned into a modified pET-32 M vector. Various mutants were created using standard two-step PCR-based methods and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins each with an N-terminal Trx-His6 tag were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells at 16 °C. The expressed proteins were purified by a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography followed by a size-exclusion chromatography. ITC was carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC at 25 °C. All proteins were dissolved in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The titration processes were performed by injecting 5–10-μl aliquots of protein samples in a syringe (concentration of 200 μm) into protein samples in cell (concentration of 20 μm) at time intervals of 120 s to ensure that the titration peak returned to the baseline. The relatively high salt concentration is used to ensure that the FERM domains used in the binding studies behave well in solution. The data were analyzed using the Origin 7.0 program and fitted by the one-site binding model. NMR samples containing 1.5 mm Crb-FBM (2111NKRATRGTYSPSAQE2125) or Crb-FBM_Thr(P)-2118 peptide were dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, with 90% H2O, 10% D2O. NMR spectra were acquired at 283 K on a Varian Inova 750-MHz spectrometer. Mixing times of 300 and 75 ms were used for the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments, respectively. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (38.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11549) Google Scholar) and analyzed with Sparky software. For crystallization, the tagged proteins were treated with a small amount of human rhinovirus 3C protease at 4 °C overnight to cleave the fusion tags and further purified by a step of size-exclusion chromatography. Crystals of the Moesin-FERM·Crb-CT complex were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C within 2 days. To set up a hanging drop, 1 μl of concentrated protein mixture at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio was mixed with 1 μl of crystallization solution with 20% PEG3350 and 0.2 m ammonium iodine. Before diffraction experiments, crystals were soaked in the crystallization solution containing an additional 30% glycerol for cryoprotection. The diffraction data were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (39.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38555) Google Scholar). The initial phase was determined by molecular replacement using the apo form of moesin-FERM (PDB code 1EF1) as the searching model. The model was refined in Phenix (40.Adams P.D.

Open table in a new tab Unlike its extracellular region, the Crb-CT, especially the PBM, FBM, and aPKC phosphorylation sites, is highly conserved across different species and isoforms (Fig. 1A). Specifically, the fly Crb-CT is essentially the same as mammalian Crb2-CT, and therefore, we continued to use the fly Crb-CT after our recent study of the Crb-CT/PALS1 interaction (20.Li Y. Wei Z. Yan Y. Wan Q. Du Q. Zhang M. Structure of Crumbs tail in complex with the PALS1 PDZ-SH3-GK tandem reveals a highly specific assembly mechanism for the apical Crumbs complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 17444-17449Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To investigate the Crb·moesin interaction, we used highly purified recombinant Crb-CT and moesin-FERM proteins. Quantitative binding assays showed that Crb-CT directly binds to moesin-FERM with a disassociation constant (Kd) of ∼5 μm in the presence of 400 mm NaCl in the assayed buffer (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, although sharing a high amino acid sequence identity with moesin-FERM, the FERM domain of merlin had no detectable binding to Crb-CT (Fig. 1C), indicating that moesin-FERM encodes its intrinsic target binding specificity. A moesin-FERM chimera (termed as moesin-FERMF3/Merlin), in which the F3 lobe was replaced by the corresponding F3 lobe of merlin, failed to bind to Crb-CT (Fig. 1D), indicating that the F3 lobe is chiefly responsible for the binding of moesin-FERM to Crb-CT. To understand the molecular basis governing the moesin·Crb interaction, we determined the structure of moesin-FERM in complex with Crb-CT by x-ray crystallography (Table 1). The moesin-FERM·Crb-CT complex crystals were diffracted to up to 1.5 Å resolution. In the crystals the moesin-FERM·Crb-CT complex forms a heterodimer with one complex per asymmetric unit. The final structural model contains most of residues from the complex, except for a flexible loop (residues 2127–2135) of Crb-CT, which connects its FBM and PBM (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2). Moesin-FERM adopts a typical cloverleaf architecture composed of three lobes (F1, F2, and F3). The overall fold of the FERM domain in the moesin·Crb complex structure is essentially identical to the apo moesin-FERM structure (the overall RMSD of 1.6 Å with the 285 aligned residues). The two highly conserved motifs in Crb-CT, FBM and PBM, bind to moesin-FERM at the F3 lobe and a cleft between the F1 and F3 lobes, respectively (Fig. 2). In FERM-containing proteins, F3 lobes act as the major target binding site. A groove (known as the αβ-groove) mainly formed by β5F3 and α1F3 is a well characterized target binding region in FERM domains including those of moesin (44.Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A.

Most of the previously characterized targets, especially those interacting with ERM proteins, bind to the αβ-groove in a β-strand or β-strand-like structures (Fig. 3B). In the moesin-FERM·Crb-CT complex, the FBM of Crb also adopts a β-strand structure and binds to the αβ-groove in the F3 lobe of moesin-FERM (Fig. 3A), extending the anti-parallel β-sheet formed by β5F3, β6F3, and β7F3. The FBM/F3 interaction is mainly mediated by hydrogen bonds. Some hydrophobic interactions (e.g. Pro-2121Crb inserts its aliphatic side chain into a hydrophobic cleft formed by Ile-245F3 and Ile-248F3) also contribute to the FBM/F3 interaction. The three consecutive and strictly conserved residues in the FBM, Gly-2117, Thr-2118, and Tyr-2119 (termed as the GTY motif and known as the iconic sequence of FBMs), are intimately involved in the FBM/F3 interaction (Fig. 3A).

https://openalex.org/W1555249890,"Regulators of G protein signaling control the duration and extent of signaling via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways by accelerating the GTP hydrolysis on G protein α subunits thereby promoting termination of GPCR signaling. A member of this family, RGS7, plays a critical role in the nervous system where it regulates multiple neurotransmitter GPCRs that mediate vision, memory, and the action of addictive drugs. Previous studies have established that in vivo RGS7 forms mutually exclusive complexes with the membrane protein RGS7-binding protein or the orphan receptor GPR158. In this study, we examine the impact of GPR158 on RGS7 in the brain. We report that knock-out of GPR158 in mice results in marked post-transcriptional destabilization of RGS7 and substantial loss of its association with membranes in several brain regions. We further identified the RGS7-binding site in the C terminus of GPR158 and found that it shares significant homology with the RGS7-binding protein. The proximal portion of the GPR158 C terminus additionally contained a conserved sequence that was capable of enhancing RGS7 GTPase-activating protein activity in solution by an allosteric mechanism acting in conjunction with the regulators of the G protein signaling-binding domain. The distal portion of the GPR158 C terminus contained several phosphodiesterase E γ-like motifs and selectively recruited G proteins in their activated state. The results of this study establish GPR158 as an essential regulator of RGS7 in the native nervous system with a critical role in controlling its expression, membrane localization, and catalytic activity. Background: RGS7 plays an essential role in regulating neuronal G protein signaling. Results: Elimination of GPR158 in mice reduces RGS7 expression and membrane localization. Unique domains in GPR158 control RGS7 catalytic activity. Conclusion: The function of RGS7 in the brain is critically regulated by binding to GPR158. Significance: This introduces a new player and its mechanism for regulating RGS activity in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2080066540,"Chronic low grade inflammation in adipose tissue during obesity is associated with an impairment of the insulin signaling cascade. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of palmitate or oleate overload of macrophage/Kupffer cells in triggering stress-mediated signaling pathways, in lipoapoptosis, and in the cross-talk with insulin signaling in hepatocytes. RAW 264.7 macrophages or Kupffer cells were stimulated with oleate or palmitate, and levels of M1/M2 polarization markers and the lipidomic profile of eicosanoids were analyzed. Whereas proinflammatory cytokines and total eicosanoids were elevated in macrophages/Kupffer cells stimulated with palmitate, enhanced arginase 1 and lower leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels were detected in macrophages stimulated with oleate. When hepatocytes were pretreated with conditioned medium (CM) from RAW 264.7 or Kupffer cells loaded with palmitate (CM-P), phosphorylation of stress kinases and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling was increased, insulin signaling was impaired, and lipoapoptosis was detected. Conversely, enhanced insulin receptor-mediated signaling and reduced levels of the phosphatases protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were found in hepatocytes treated with CM from macrophages stimulated with oleate (CM-O). Supplementation of CM-O with LTB4 suppressed insulin sensitization and increased PTP1B and PTEN. Furthermore, LTB4 decreased insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in hepatocytes, activated the NFκB pathway, and up-regulated PTP1B and PTEN, these effects being mediated by LTB4 receptor BTL1. In conclusion, oleate and palmitate elicit an opposite cross-talk between macrophages/Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Whereas CM-P interferes at the early steps of insulin signaling, CM-O increases insulin sensitization, possibly by reducing LTB4.Background: Chronic low grade inflammation during obesity is associated with impairments in the insulin signaling cascade.Results: Oleate and palmitate elicit opposite effects in insulin signaling in hepatocytes through macrophage stimulation.Conclusion: An endocrine/paracrine cross-talk between macrophages/Kupffer cells and hepatocytes modulates insulin signaling.Significance: Switching macrophage/Kupffer cell polarization will be of benefit against insulin resistance in the liver.

When hepatocytes were pretreated with conditioned medium (CM) from RAW 264.7 or Kupffer cells loaded with palmitate (CM-P), phosphorylation of stress kinases and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling was increased, insulin signaling was impaired, and lipoapoptosis was detected. Conversely, enhanced insulin receptor-mediated signaling and reduced levels of the phosphatases protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were found in hepatocytes treated with CM from macrophages stimulated with oleate (CM-O). Supplementation of CM-O with LTB4 suppressed insulin sensitization and increased PTP1B and PTEN. Furthermore, LTB4 decreased insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in hepatocytes, activated the NFκB pathway, and up-regulated PTP1B and PTEN, these effects being mediated by LTB4 receptor BTL1. In conclusion, oleate and palmitate elicit an opposite cross-talk between macrophages/Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Whereas CM-P interferes at the early steps of insulin signaling, CM-O increases insulin sensitization, possibly by reducing LTB4. Background: Chronic low grade inflammation during obesity is associated with impairments in the insulin signaling cascade. Results: Oleate and palmitate elicit opposite effects in insulin signaling in hepatocytes through macrophage stimulation. Conclusion: An endocrine/paracrine cross-talk between macrophages/Kupffer cells and hepatocytes modulates insulin signaling. Significance: Switching macrophage/Kupffer cell polarization will be of benefit against insulin resistance in the liver. Evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies has clearly established that obesity is the most common cause of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In fact, insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, such as liver and skeletal muscle, is an early metabolic abnormality in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (1.Kahn S.E. Hull R.L. Utzschneider K.M. Mechanisms linking obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.Nature. 2006; 444: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (3455) Google Scholar). Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance associated with obesity have not been completely elucidated, one major contributor is the chronic low grade systemic inflammation state that interferes with the early steps of the insulin signaling cascade, possibly through the effects of free fatty acids (FFAs) 3The abbreviations used are: FFAfree fatty acidPTP1Bprotein tyrosine phosphatase 1BPTENphosphatase and tensin homologIRinsulin receptorIRSinsulin receptor substrateCMconditioned medium/mediaCM-PCM-O, or CM-B, CM treated with palmitate, oleate, or BSA, respectivelyIKKIκB kinaseERendoplasmic reticulumPGprostaglandinLTleukotrieneCHOPtranscription factor C/EBP homologous protein11-HETE11-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,12E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid12-HHT12S-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid15-HETE15-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid. and cytokines secreted by the overgrowing white adipose tissue (2.Attie A.D.

Proinflammatory cytokines impair insulin action by activating stress kinases such as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), IκB kinase (IKK), and also protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated pathways (5.Hotamisligil G.S.

In addition, cytokines down-regulate early key mediators of the insulin signaling cascade, such as the insulin receptor (IR) or insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (7.Meshkani R. Adeli K.

In addition to the inflammatory effects, the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated signaling pathways by FFAs has been linked to obesity-associated immunometabolic dysregulation and insulin resistance (17.Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Görgün C. Glimcher L.H. Hotamisligil G.S.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress is reduced in tissues of obese subjects after weight loss.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). ER stress is sensed by three main proteins, X-BP1 (X-box-binding protein 1), PERK (PRKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), and ATF6 (activating transcription factor-6), which cooperate to mitigate ER stress by reducing protein translation, stabilizing proteins by chaperones, and activating ER-associated protein degradation (19.Scull C.M. Tabas I. Mechanisms of ER stress-induced apoptosis in atherosclerosis.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2011; 31: 2792-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Chemical chaperones (tauroursodeoxycholic acid and 4-phenylbutryate) that alleviate ER stress through protein stabilization, improve systemic glucose homeostasis, increase glucose uptake in adipose and skeletal muscle, and reduce hepatic glucose production (20.Ozcan U.

Chemical chaperones reduce ER stress and restore glucose homeostasis in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes.Science. 2006; 313: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Moreover, a study in obese subjects has revealed that treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid increases insulin sensitivity in liver and skeletal muscle by ∼30% compared with the placebo therapy (21.Kars M. Yang L. Gregor M.F. Mohammed B.S. Pietka T.A. Finck B.N. Patterson B.W. Horton J.D. Mittendorfer B. Hotamisligil G.S. Klein S. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid may improve liver and muscle but not adipose tissue insulin sensitivity in obese men and women.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). FFA-derived metabolites are relevant factors in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome (22.Norris P.C. Dennis E.A. A lipidomic perspective on inflammatory macrophage eicosanoid signaling.Adv. Biol. Regul. 2014; 54: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Eicosanoids (prostaglandins (PGs), tromboxanes, leukotrienes (LTs), and cytochrome P450 metabolites) are bioactive lipids synthesized from polyunsaturated FFAs, such as proinflammatory ω-6 arachidonic acid or anti-inflammatory ω-3 eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid through the cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and cytochrome P450 pathways. The functional role of eicosanoids in obesity and insulin resistance has recently been studied in humans and animal models. For instance, an accumulation of polyunsaturated FFAs, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and 6-keto-prostaglandin-F1α was observed in plasma from patients with metabolic syndrome (23.Novgorodtseva T.P. Karaman Y.K. Zhukova N.V. Lobanova E.G. Antonyuk M.V. Kantur T.A. Composition of fatty acids in plasma and erythrocytes and eicosanoids level in patients with metabolic syndrome.Lipids Health Dis. 2011; 10: 82Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, the development of insulin resistance in patients affected by metabolic syndrome leads to increased synthesis of thromboxane A2. Regarding studies in cellular and animal models, it was shown that PGE2 aggravates insulin resistance induced by interleukin 6 (IL6) in hepatocytes (24.Henkel J. Neuschäfer-Rube F. Pathe-Neuschäfer-Rube A. Püschel G.P. Aggravation by prostaglandin E2 of interleukin-6-dependent insulin resistance in hepatocytes.Hepatology. 2009; 50: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas BLT1 (LTB4 receptor 1)-deficient mice are resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (25.Spite M.

Immunol. 2011; 187: 1942-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported that besides adipocytes, adipose tissue resident macrophages, which migrate and accumulate in white adipose tissue, have a relevant role in obesity-induced chronic inflammation (26.Kamei N.

Although the importance of macrophages in the molecular mechanisms triggering insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue has been explored (29.Lumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R.

Palmitate-activated macrophages confer insulin resistance to muscle cells by a mechanism involving protein kinase C θ and ε.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e26947Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether the inflammatory milieu impacts insulin signaling in hepatocytes. On that basis, in this study, we have investigated for the first time the effect of macrophages activated by two distinct FFAs, palmitate (saturated) and oleate (unsaturated), on stress-mediated pathways, lipoapoptosis, and the insulin signaling cascade in hepatocytes. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) (catalog no. 10270) and culture medium DMEM (catalog no. 41966–029) were obtained from Invitrogen. TRIzol reagent (catalog no. T9424), sodium palmitate (catalog no. P9767), sodium oleate (catalog no. O7501), bovine serum albumin (BSA) (catalog no. A6003), fatty acid-free BSA endotoxin-free (catalog no. A8806), and insulin (catalog no. I0516) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Bradford reagent, acrylamide, immunoblotting PVDF membrane, and Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate were purchased from Bio-Rad. 2.5 mm FFA stock solutions were prepared by a modification of the Spector method (32.Spector A.A. Structure and lipid binding properties of serum albumin.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 320-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, cold sodium palmitate or sodium oleate was dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH by heating at 70 °C while 0.5 mm BSA solution was prepared by dissolving fatty acid-free BSA in NaCl 0.9% by heating at 50 °C (at maximum). Once BSA and FFA solutions were completely dissolved, palmitate and oleate solutions were diluted 10 times in the BSA solution and mixed by pipetting to achieve a final molar ratio of 5:1. Control BSA was prepared by adding the same amount of 0.1 m NaOH into 0.5 mm BSA solution. All preparations were filtered, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. The murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line, kindly provided by Dr. Tarín (CNIC, Madrid, Spain), was cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. The generation and characterization of immortalized mouse hepatocyte cell line have been described previously (33.Gonzalez-Rodriguez A. Clampit J.E. Escribano O. Benito M. Rondinone C.M. Valverde A.M. Developmental switch from prolonged insulin action to increased insulin sensitivity in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B-deficient hepatocytes.Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 594-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in DMEM plus 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Confluent macrophages were treated with BSA or FFA solutions (750 μm conjugated oleate/BSA or 750 μm conjugated palmitate/BSA) for 24 h to obtain the corresponding conditioned medium (CM) (31.Kewalramani G. Fink L.N. Asadi F. Klip A. Palmitate-activated macrophages confer insulin resistance to muscle cells by a mechanism involving protein kinase C θ and ε.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e26947Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CM were centrifuged to remove dead cells and directly added (without dilution) to hepatocytes for several time periods. In all experiments, comparable mRNA levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers were observed in RAW 264.7 macrophages. For Kupffer cell isolation, the supernatant from the first centrifugation of the hepatocyte isolation protocol was collected and centrifuged twice at 50 × g for 5 min to discard the pellet with the remaining hepatocytes. The latest supernatant was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet containing the Kupffer cells was resuspended in attachment medium. Cells were mixed by inversion with 50% Percoll and centrifuged at 1.059 × g for 30 min without acceleration or brake at room temperature. Finally, the Kupffer cell pellet was washed with 1× PBS and centrifuged twice at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to wash out the residual Percoll solution, and cells were resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were then plated on 12-well plates and maintained for 24 h before treatments. Conditioned medium was prepared as described in RAW 264.7 cells. Human hepatocytes were isolated by the two-step collagenase procedure from non-tumor areas of liver biopsies from patients submitted to a surgical resection for liver tumors after obtaining patients' written consent (34.Pichard L. Raulet E. Fabre G. Ferrini J.B. Ourlin J.C. Maurel P. Human hepatocyte culture.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 320: 283-293PubMed Google Scholar). Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from non-fasting male C57BL/6 mice (10–12 weeks old) by perfusion with collagenase as described (35.Benveniste R. Danoff T.M. Ilekis J. Craig H.R. Epidermal growth factor receptor numbers in male and female mouse primary hepatocyte cultures.Cell Biochem. Funct. 1988; 6: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on a 6-well plate (Corning, Inc.) and cultured in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) with 10% FBS, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (attachment medium) and maintained for 24 h before treatments. The generation and characterization of the immortalized mouse hepatocyte cell line have been described previously (33.Gonzalez-Rodriguez A. Clampit J.E. Escribano O. Benito M. Rondinone C.M. Valverde A.M. Developmental switch from prolonged insulin action to increased insulin sensitivity in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B-deficient hepatocytes.Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 594-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Ambion (Life Technologies) for gene silencing of mouse BLT1 and arginase 1. Immortalized mouse hepatocytes or RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded in 6-cm dishes and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight. When 40–50% confluence was reached, cells were transfected with BLT1 or arginase 1 siRNA at different concentrations (5–25 nm) or with a scrambled siRNA, used as a control. After 36 h, cells were used for experiments. 0.01% (w/v) of butylated hydroxytoluene in methanol was added to supernatants to prevent metabolite degradation. CM collected from macrophages treated with BSA or FFAs solutions were melted slowly, and 400 pmol of deuterated PGE2 and LTB4 were added as internal standards before solid phase extraction. Lipid metabolites were extracted using Bond Elut Plexa solid phase extraction columns (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) as indicated by the manufacturer. Columns were homogenized with 3 ml of methanol followed by 3 ml of water. Supernatants were acidified with 0.5% acetic acid, and 10% methanol was also added before sample loading. Samples were washed with 3 ml of 10% methanol, and finally, lipid products were eluted with 2 × 1.5 ml of 100% methanol. Lipid metabolites were concentrated under vacuum and redissolved in 100 μl of solvent A (water/acetonitrile/acetic acid, 70:30:0.02 (v/v/v)) for their analysis by HPLC/MS/MS. The chromatographic protocol was adapted from Dumlao et al. (36.Dumlao D.S. Buczynski M.W. Norris P.C. Harkewicz R. Dennis E.A. High-throughput lipidomic analysis of fatty acid derived eicosanoids and N-acylethanolamines.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1811: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Quantification was carried out by the integration of chromatographic peaks of the previously identified species compared with an external calibration curve made with analytical standards. The software Analyst 1.5.2 was employed in this process. To obtain total cell lysates, attached cells were scraped off and incubated for 10 min on ice with lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 2.5 nm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After protein content determination with Bradford reagent, total protein was boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and submitted to 8–15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to immunoblot PVDF membrane, and, after blocking with 3% BSA or 5% nonfat dry milk, membranes were incubated overnight with several antibodies, as indicated. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL Western blotting protocol. Densitometric analysis of the bands was performed using ImageJ software. The anti-phospho-PERK (Thr-980) (catalog no. 3179), anti-phospho-eIF2α (Ser-51) (catalog no. 9721), anti-phospho-JNK (catalog no. 9251), anti-phospho-STAT3 (catalog no. 9131), anti-phospho-MAPK (catalog no. 9101), and anti-MAPK (catalog no. 4695) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).

Anti-α-tubulin (T5168) and anti-β-actin antibodies (A5441) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-arginase 1 antibody (610708) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and was reverse transcribed using a SuperScriptTM III First-Strand Synthesis System for quantitative PCR following the manufacturer's indications. Quantitative PCR was performed with an ABI 7900 sequence detector using the SYBR Green method and d(N)6 random hexamer with primers purchased from Invitrogen. PCR thermocycling parameters were 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Each sample was run in triplicate and normalized to 18 S RNA. -Fold changes were determined using the ΔΔCt method. Primer sequences are available upon request. Cells were grown in glass coverslips and treated as described above. Then cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in p-formaldehyde (4%) for 10 min, and characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis were assessed by staining nuclei with DAPI followed by the analysis by fluorescence microscopy. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. and were compared by using the Bonferroni analysis of variance test. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM, Armonk, NY) software with two-sided tests. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. The liver is composed primarily of hepatocytes but also contains blood and lymph vessels, nerves, and immune cells. Because all of these cell types can potentially respond to a high fat-mediated inflammatory environment in vivo, we used a cell culture-based approach to investigate the specific cross-talk between macrophages and hepatocytes in the context of fatty acid overload. For this goal, RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with palmitate, a typical saturated FFA found in Western diets, for 24 h. Then, culture medium (conditioned medium) was removed. Conditioned medium was hereafter called CM-P (collected from RAW 264.7 cells treated with palmitate) or CM-B (from RAW 264.7 cells treated only with BSA as a control). CM-B or CM-P was added to immortalized mouse hepatocytes generated and validated in our laboratory (33.Gonzalez-Rodriguez A. Clampit J.E. Escribano O. Benito M. Rondinone C.M. Valverde A.M. Developmental switch from prolonged insulin action to increased insulin sensitivity in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B-deficient hepatocytes.Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 594-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for a further 24 h, and then cells were stimulated with 10 nm insulin for 10 min. As depicted in Fig. 1A, IR tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced in hepatocytes preincubated with CM from palmitate-treated macrophages compared with those treated with control CM-B. Likewise, levels of IRS1 decreased only in hepatocytes treated with CM-P in parallel with decreases in Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation in response to insulin. Notably, we found similar impairment of the insulin signaling in hepatocytes treated with CM collected from RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with palmitate for 8 h and then refed with fresh medium for a further 16 h (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the components of the CM-P are sufficient to mediate the negative effects observed in insulin signaling in hepatocytes. Next, we checked that the effects of CM-P on insulin signaling in hepatocytes were specific to palmitate treatment and not due to the FFA overload. For this goal, we obtained conditioned medium from RAW 264.7 cells treated with oleate, a well known nontoxic monounsaturated FFA. Conditioned medium was hereafter called CM-O (collected from RAW 264.7 cells treated with oleate). After the addition of CM-B, CM-O, or CM-P for 24 h, immortalized mouse hepatocytes were stimu"
https://openalex.org/W1991970255,"The mechanism by which ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths of sunlight trigger or exacerbate the symptoms of the autoimmune disorder lupus erythematosus is not known but may involve a role for the innate immune system. Here we show that UV radiation potentiates STING (stimulator of interferon genes)-dependent activation of the immune signaling transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in response to cytosolic DNA and cyclic dinucleotides in keratinocytes and other human cells. Furthermore, we find that modulation of this innate immune response also occurs with UV-mimetic chemical carcinogens and in a manner that is independent of DNA repair and several DNA damage and cell stress response signaling pathways. Rather, we find that the stimulation of STING-dependent IRF3 activation by UV is due to apoptotic signaling-dependent disruption of ULK1 (Unc51-like kinase 1), a pro-autophagic protein that negatively regulates STING. Thus, deregulation of ULK1 signaling by UV-induced DNA damage may contribute to the negative effects of sunlight UV exposure in patients with autoimmune disorders.Background: UV wavelengths of sunlight exacerbate the symptoms of autoimmunity.Results: UV and UV-mimetic chemical carcinogens stimulate STING-dependent innate immune signaling in keratinocytes and other human cells by disrupting the STING negative regulator ULK1.Conclusion: STING-dependent innate immune signaling is elevated in UV-irradiated human cells.Significance: Deregulation of innate immune signaling by UV light may contribute to autoimmunity. The mechanism by which ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths of sunlight trigger or exacerbate the symptoms of the autoimmune disorder lupus erythematosus is not known but may involve a role for the innate immune system. Here we show that UV radiation potentiates STING (stimulator of interferon genes)-dependent activation of the immune signaling transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in response to cytosolic DNA and cyclic dinucleotides in keratinocytes and other human cells.

However, there may be additional mechanisms that take place in viable and non-immune cells, such as keratinocytes, that modulate immune signaling within the skin and throughout the body. In this report, we show that UV and UV-mimetic chemical carcinogens stimulate STING-dependent IRF3 activation in response to cytosolic DNA and cyclic dinucleotides in keratinocytes and other human cells. Moreover, we find that this effect is independent of DNA repair and several major UV-dependent DNA damage response and cell stress signaling pathways. Instead, abrogation of the negative STING regulator and pro-autophagic factor ULK1 (Unc51-like kinase 1) (32.Konno H. Konno K. Barber G.N. Cyclic dinucleotides trigger ULK1 (ATG1) phosphorylation of STING to prevent sustained innate immune signaling.Cell. 2013; 155: 688-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) by UV-induced apoptotic signaling is responsible for potentiating the cellular innate immune responses to cytosolic DNA and cyclic dinucleotides. These data therefore provide a novel mechanism by which UV and related environmental genotoxins may trigger or exacerbate autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. Human THP-1 monocytes, HaCaT keratinocytes, and HEK293T cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in either RPMI1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293T cells stably expressing HA-tagged STING were generated by transfection of pUNO1-hSTING-HA3x (Invivogen) and selection with blasticidin. To expose cells to UV radiation, cells were placed under a GE germicidal lamp that emits primarily 254-nm UV light (UV-C) connected to a digital timer and irradiated with the indicated fluences of UV light (typically 100 J/m2). Other genotoxic compounds were added directly to tissue culture media as indicated. Fractionation of cells to yield cytosolic and nuclear fractions was performed as previously described (33.Kemp M.G.

The ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related) inhibitor VE-821 was purchased from Selleckchem. 2′,3′-cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP), 3′,3′-cGAMP, and c-di-GMP (cyclic di-GMP) were from Invivogen. ISD was transfected into THP-1 cells (typically 400,000 cells per ml in 2 ml of culture medium in a 3.5-cm plate) or HaCaT (90% confluent) using a 1:1 ratio of DNA (typically 5 μg) to Lipofectamine 2000 (5 μl) as recommended by Invitrogen. Where indicated, cells were irradiated with UV radiation 20–30 min before transfection with ISD. Transfection with 2′,3′-cGAMP, 3′,3′-cGAMP, and c-di-GMP was performed in a similar manner using Lipofectamine 2000. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were harvested 3.5–4 h after transfection, pelleted by centrifugation (1,600 × g, 4 min), washed with PBS, and then lysed for 10 min on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, and 10 mm glycerophosphate.

Chemiluminescence was visualized with Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) or Amersham Biosciences ECL Advance Substrate (GE Healthcare) using a Molecular Imager Chemi-Doc XRS+ system (Bio-Rad). Chemiluminescent signals were quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). For each treatment condition the phospho-IRF3 (IRF3-P) signals were normalized to total IRF3 levels and then normalized to the highest IRF3-P/IRF3 signal ratio for each blot (which was set to an arbitrary value of 100). All experiments were repeated at least twice, and the average and S.E. calculated for each treatment.

Briefly, after centrifugation and washing of UV-irradiated cells with cold PBS, the cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 m, and cells were incubated on ice for 1 h. Hirt lysates were then prepared by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and digested with proteinase K for 30 min at 60 °C. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the samples were resuspended in 10 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Half of the resuspended DNA was 3′-end labeled in a 10-μl reaction containing 6 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT; New England Biolabs), 0.25 mm CoCl2, and 3′-[α-32P]ATP (cordycepin 5′-triphosphate; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 1× TdT buffer (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the radiolabeled excised oligonucleotides were separated on urea-containing polyacrylamide gels and then detected with phosphorimaging.

Although exposure to UV wavelengths of sunlight is known to exacerbate the symptoms of the autoimmune disorder SLE (1.Baer R.L. Harber L.C. Photobiology of lupus erythematosus.Arch. Dermatol. 1965; 92: 124-128Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2.Epstein J.H. Tuffanelli D. Dubois E.L. Light sensitivity and lupus erythematosus.Arch.

Ultraviolet radiation and systemic lupus erythematosus.Lupus. 2014; 23: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for this effect and the relative roles of the innate and adaptive immune systems are not clear. Because the protein STING has emerged as a critical regulator of innate immunity (6.Ishikawa H. Barber G.N. STING is an endoplasmic reticulum adaptor that facilitates innate immune signalling.Nature. 2008; 455: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar, 7.Ishikawa H. Ma Z. Barber G.N.

The adaptor protein MITA links virus-sensing receptors to IRF3 transcription factor activation.Immunity. 2008; 29: 538-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar), we therefore considered the possibility that UV light may specifically modulate STING-dependent innate immune signaling. To test this hypothesis, THP-1 monocytes were exposed to increasing amounts of UV radiation and then harvested to examine STING activation. In response to specific immune stimuli such as cytosolic DNA, activated STING functions as a scaffold or adaptor protein to facilitate the phosphorylation of IRF3 on Ser-396 by the upstream kinase TBK1 (22.Tanaka Y. Chen Z.J. STING specifies IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 in the cytosolic DNA signaling pathway.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: ra20Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). As a positive control for activation of the STING-IRF3 pathway in these experiments, we transfected cells with a 45-bp-long dsDNA termed interferon-stimulatory DNA (ISD) for its ability to induce interferon expression in responsive cells (23.Stetson D.B. Medzhitov R. Recognition of cytosolic DNA activates an IRF3-dependent innate immune response.Immunity. 2006; 24: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, although ISD induced a robust response (lane 6), IRF3 phosphorylation was not observed in the UV-irradiated cells even at high doses of UV that saturate the ability of the nucleotide excision repair system to remove UV photoproducts from genomic DNA (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). We next performed time course experiments to monitor the kinetics of IRF3 phosphorylation after UV irradiation. Although UV induced rapid phosphorylation of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk1, there was no evidence of IRF3 phosphorylation at any time point after irradiation (Fig. 1B). Similarly, when we treated THP-1 cells with the UV-mimetic AAF, we did not observe detectable levels of IRF3 phosphorylation (data not shown). These results indicate that the exposure of cultured human cells to UV alone is not sufficient to activate IRF3. Because IRF3 phosphorylation is essential for downstream innate immune signaling responses to cytosolic DNA (23.Stetson D.B. Medzhitov R. Recognition of cytosolic DNA activates an IRF3-dependent innate immune response.Immunity. 2006; 24: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), we conclude that UV does not directly induce a STING/IRF3-mediated innate immune response. In addition to sunlight exposure, viral and microbial infections are additional risk factors for SLE (39.Nelson P. Rylance P. Roden D. Trela M. Tugnet N. Viruses as potential pathogenic agents in systemic lupus erythematosus.Lupus. 2014; 23: 596-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 40.Zandman-Goddard G. Shoenfeld Y. SLE and infections.Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2003; 25: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and may result in the release of pathogen-derived DNA into the cytosol of infected cells. Whether exposures to UV wavelengths of sunlight may work in concert with microbial infections to impact the symptoms of autoimmune disorders is not known. We, therefore, sought to mimic such a scenario by introducing DNA into the cytosol of UV-irradiated cells. THP-1 cells were irradiated with UV and then transfected with increasing amounts of ISD. As shown in Fig. 2A, under conditions where limiting amounts of ISD were introduced into cells, UV exposure enhanced IRF3 phosphorylation and, to a lesser extent, the phosphorylation of the upstream IRF3 kinase TBK1, which can undergo STING-dependent autophosphorylation (22.Tanaka Y. Chen Z.J. STING specifies IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 in the cytosolic DNA signaling pathway.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: ra20Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the level of IRF3 phosphorylation potentiated by UV in ISD-transfected cells was dependent on UV dose and became saturated at ∼100 J/m2 (Fig. 2B), which is a dose that saturates nucleotide excision repair capacity in THP-1 cells (Fig. 1A). Moreover, time course experiments showed that UV affected the amplitude of IRF3 phosphorylation but not the general kinetics of the response following ISD administration (Fig. 2C). Additional experiments aimed at determining how the timing of UV exposure relative to the exposure of the cytosol to DNA affected this response showed that UV exposures up to 1 h before or after transfection with ISD led to maximal stimulation of IRF3 phosphorylation but that prolonged incubation times of >1–2 h after irradiation and before ISD transfection instead inhibited TBK1-IRF3 signaling in response to ISD (data not shown). These results indicate that an optimal window of exposure exists under which UV can enhance TBK1-IRF3 signaling in response to cytosolic DNA. A quantitative analysis of the response of THP-1 monocytes to UV under optimized conditions of ISD concentration, UV dose, and treatment time is presented in Fig. 2D. These data show that the phosphorylation of IRF3 was completely ISD-dependent a"

Nevertheless, a considerable amount of active compounds is still under-investigated due to the high complexity of this venom. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of putative potassium channel toxins (KTxs) from the cDNA library of M. eupeus venom glands, and we compare the deduced KTx structures with peptides purified from the venom. For the transcriptome analysis, we used conventional tools as well as a search for structural motifs characteristic of scorpion venom components in the form of regular expressions. We found 59 candidate KTxs distributed in 30 subfamilies and presenting the cysteine-stabilized α/β and inhibitor cystine knot types of fold. M. eupeus venom was then separated to individual components by multistage chromatography. A facile fluorescent system based on the expression of the KcsA-Kv1.1 hybrid channels in Escherichia coli and utilization of a labeled scorpion toxin was elaborated and applied to follow Kv1.1 pore binding activity during venom separation. As a result, eight high affinity Kv1.1 channel blockers were identified, including five novel peptides, which extend the panel of potential pharmacologically important Kv1 ligands.

Cell-free carbohydrate binding assays revealed that AMPK autophosphorylation abolished its carbohydrate-binding capacity. X-ray structural data of the CBM displays the central positioning of threonine 148 within the binding pocket. Substitution of Thr-148 for a phospho-mimicking aspartate (T148D) prevents AMPK from binding to carbohydrate.

https://openalex.org/W2005410495,"It is recognized that genetic factors contribute to human longevity. Besides the hypothesis of existence of longevity genes, another suggests that a lower frequency of risk alleles decreases the incidence of age-related diseases in the long-lived people. However, the latter finds no support from recent genetic studies. Considering the crucial role of epigenetic modification in gene regulation, we then hypothesize that suppressing disease-related genes in longevity individuals is likely achieved by epigenetic modification, e.g. DNA methylation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the genome-wide methylation profile in 4 Chinese female centenarians and 4 middle-aged controls using methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing. 626 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were observed between both groups. Interestingly, genes with these DMRs were enriched in age-related diseases, including type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. This pattern remains rather stable after including methylomes of two white individuals. Further analyses suggest that the observed DMRs likely have functional roles in regulating disease-associated gene expressions, with some genes [e.g. caspase 3 (CASP3)] being down-regulated whereas the others [i.e. interleukin 1 receptor, type 2 (IL1R2)] up-regulated. Therefore, our study suggests that suppressing the disease-related genes via epigenetic modification is an important contributor to human longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2024221325,"Ser/Thr kinase NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase) mediates the activation of the noncanonical NF-κB2 pathway, and it plays an important role in regulating immune cell development and liver homeostasis. NIK levels are extremely low in quiescent cells due to ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, and cytokines stimulate NIK activation through increasing NIK stability; however, regulation of NIK stability is not fully understood. Here we identified CHIP (carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein) as a new negative regulator of NIK. CHIP contains three N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), a middle dimerization domain, and a C-terminal U-box. The U-box domain contains ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that promotes ubiquitination of CHIP-bound partners. We observed that CHIP bound to NIK via its TPR domain. In both HEK293 and primary hepatocytes, overexpression of CHIP markedly decreased NIK levels at least in part through increasing ubiquitination and degradation of NIK. Accordingly, CHIP suppressed NIK-induced activation of the noncanonical NF-κB2 pathway. CHIP also bound to TRAF3, and CHIP and TRAF3 acted coordinately to efficiently promote NIK degradation. The TPR but not the U-box domain was required for CHIP to promote NIK degradation. In mice, hepatocyte-specific overexpression of NIK resulted in liver inflammation and injury, leading to death, and liver-specific expression of CHIP reversed the detrimental effects of hepatic NIK. Our data suggest that CHIP/TRAF3/NIK interactions recruit NIK to E3 ligase complexes for ubiquitination and degradation, thus maintaining NIK at low levels. Defects in CHIP regulation of NIK may result in aberrant NIK activation in the liver, contributing to live injury, inflammation, and disease."

C.2009: 156-170Google Scholar). When a positive strand RNA virus first enters a cell to initiate infection, a minuscule number of invading viral genomic RNAs must compete with the overwhelming number of host mRNAs to gain a foothold in the translational machinery. Before RNA replication can commence, viral RNA must be translated in order to synthesize the viral replicase. To outcompete host mRNAs for the ribosomes and to evade host translational control mechanisms, positive strand RNA viruses have evolved a plethora of non-canonical translation initiation mechanisms (2.Reineke L.C.

Numerous plant and animal viral mRNAs do not possess a 5′-cap structure (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)N) in the mRNA and translate efficiently using alternative cap-independent pathways. Many viruses harbor sequences and a complex secondary structure within their untranslated regions (UTRs) that allow them to bypass cellular translation control steps to produce viral proteins. The 5′-terminal regions of animal and some plant viral mRNAs contain an IRES that recruits the 40S subunit to promote cap-independent translation (10.Pelletier J. Sonenberg N.

The loop of stem-loop III (3′-SL-III) of the 3′-BTE forms a long distance RNA-RNA “kissing” stem-loop base-pairing interaction with a loop in the 5′-end of the mRNA (25.Miller W.A. White K.A.

Rakotondrafara A.M. Miller W.A. Cap-independent translation of plant viral RNAs.Virus Res. 2006; 119: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Binding of the 3′-BTE to eIF4G and to the 5′-UTR are required for efficient cap-independent translation. Finally, the 3′-BTE does not appear to be an IRES, because this translation initiation requires ribosome scanning from the 5′-end of the mRNA (22.Guo L. Allen E.M. Miller W.A.

To accommodate these observations, two models have been proposed. Either eIF4F (via its eIF4G subunit) binds the 3′-BTE and is delivered to the 5′-UTR, via long distance base pairing, where it recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit (in the 43 S preinitiation complex), or eIF4F recruits the 40S subunit to the 3′-BTE. The BTE then base-pairs to the 5′-UTR to deliver the 43 S preinitiation complex to the 5′-end (23.Rakotondrafara A.M. Polacek C. Harris E. Miller W.A. Oscillating kissing stem-loop interactions mediate 5′ scanning-dependent translation by a viral 3′-cap-independent translation element.RNA. 2006; 12: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the involvement of any other initiation factors in BYDV translation initiation remains unknown (24.Treder K. Kneller E.L. Allen E.M. Wang Z. Browning K.S. Miller W.A. The 3′ cap-independent translation element of Barley yellow dwarf virus binds eIF4F via the eIF4G subunit to initiate translation.RNA. 2008; 14: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The results described here address these questions. We found that 40S ribosomal subunits bind directly to the 3′-BTE with a low affinity and that this affinity increases significantly in the presence of eIF4F, helicase factors eIF4A and eIF4B, and ATP. We also confirm that 80S ribosome loading to the start codon of the message is possible only in the presence of the 3′-BTE. Furthermore, we observed a ribosome toeprint in the SL-I region of 3′-BTE in the wheat germ in vitro translation system and with purified eIFs. Our results support the model in which the 40S subunit binds the 3′-BTE facilitated by the eIF4 translation factors and in which the long distance base pairing promotes transfer of the 40S complex to the 5′-UTR, where scanning and subsequent translation ensue. 3′-BTE and mutant 3′-BTE-BF transcripts were generated from synthetic DNA oligonucleotides with a T-7 promoter obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). BLucB is a reporter plasmid containing the firefly luciferase gene flanked by the BYDV genomic 5′- and 3′-UTRs.

BLucB-SL-Dm1 is a mutated BLucB plasmid where CUGACAA nucleotides of stem-loop D (5′-SL-D) were mutated to CUGUCAA to disrupt the “kissing loop” interaction.

Protein purity was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. All protein samples were dialyzed against buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm DTT). RNA unwinding using helicase (eIF4A-4B-4F) complex was performed as described previously (44.Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N.

Initiation factors eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F (2.0 μm concentration of each) and 5 mm ATP were incubated with 50 nm 32P-labeled 3′-BTE RNA or 3′-BTEBF RNA for 1 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 20 mm (HEPES)-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm GTP, 20 units of RNAsin (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 10 μl. After a 1-h incubation, 40S ribosomal subunits (final concentration of 500 nm) were added to the helicase reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. As a control experiment, mRNAs were incubated with eIF4F and 40S subunits separately under the same experimental conditions. Reactions were stopped by adding loading dye and applied to a native 2% polyacrylamide, 2% agarose gel that had been prerun at 30 mA for 30 min. Electrophoresis was carried out at 50 mA for 2 h at 4 °C. The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) overnight and quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). RNA structure probing was done by the selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) method (45.Wilkinson K.A. Merino E.J. Weeks K.M.

The RNA solution was treated with benzoyl cyanide (1 μl of 10× BzCN, 400 mm in DMSO) and allowed to react for 2.5 s (equal to five BzCN half-lives). Control reactions contained 1 μl of DMSO.

Although once considered a variant of multiple sclerosis, clues to the nature of disease were first revealed by the detection of an NMO-specific serum antibody (Ab) response, termed NMO-IgG, that immunostained the surface of microvessels, pia, subpia, and Virchow-Robin spaces in the CNS (1.Lennon V.A.

NMO IgG was subsequently shown to recognize the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which is expressed on astrocytes in the CNS and is preferentially polarized to astrocytic end-foot processes (2.Lennon V.A.

Med. 2005; 202: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). We showed that during disease exacerbation, CSF from NMO patients contained a dynamic population of expanded and clonally related plasmablasts that were enriched for cells producing Abs against the extracellular domains of AQP4 (3.Bennett J.L.

More importantly, AQP4-specific recombinant Abs (rAbs) derived from these CSF plasmablasts, when administered in experimental animals, recapitulated the myriad pathological features of NMO lesions that include perivascular loss of astrocytes, terminal complement activation, granulocyte infiltration, and subsequent oligodendrocyte cell death and myelinolysis (3.Bennett J.L.

Although knowledge of NMO pathology has been greatly enhanced by the identification of NMO-IgG, many questions remain regarding the origin of this CNS B cell response, its variation across the NMO patient population, and the steps and signaling pathways leading from astrocyte destruction to demyelination. One critical factor that promotes Ab-mediated CNS tissue damage is the ability of the M23 isoform of AQP4 to assemble from tetramers into large supramolecular structures called orthogonal array of particles (OAPs). AQP4 is expressed in alternative isoforms termed long (M1) and short (M23). The M23 isoform promotes OAP formation, and the size of OAPs is determined by the ratio of M23:M1 isoforms (8.Verbavatz J.M. Ma T. Gobin R. Verkman A.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4577-4580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A quantitative comparison of binding to the M1 and M23 isoforms shows that both serum NMO-IgG and most NMO CSF-derived rAbs bind with higher affinity to OAPs than to tetramers and that structural changes in the AQP4 epitope upon array assembly, and not bivalent binding of IgG, drive this increased affinity (10.Crane J.M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 16516-16524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). OAP formation is also required for anti-AQP4 Abs to initiate complement-dependent cell lysis, which likely occurs through the promotion of a multivalent interaction of C1q molecules with cell surface-bound AQP4 Abs (10.Crane J.M.

Presently, it is not known whether the binding of Abs to specific epitopes on AQP4 may preferentially affect lesion formation and contribute to differences in disease severity. Studies to define the depth and specificity of the NMO serum IgG response have been somewhat disparate. In two separate studies using serum NMO-IgG to define AQP4 epitopes, Pisani et al.

Recently, mutation of Asp69 has been shown to alter loop A conformation and reduce binding of NMO patient sera (14.Pisani F. Mola M.G. Simone L. Rosito S. Alberga D. Mangiatordi G.F. Lattanzi G.

Each of these studies, however, was hampered by the use of polyclonal serum NMO-IgG that contains multiple AQP4 autoantibodies with a wide range of affinities directed against many distinct epitopes, some of which may be nonpathogenic species directed against denatured AQP4 protein or protein fragments. In this study, we define the dominant epitopes recognized by a panel of AQP4-specific monoclonal recombinant Abs from CSF plasmablasts recovered from five NMO patients. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate seven 4- to 6-amino acid serial substitutions and 29-point mutations encompassing most amino acids (glycines excluded) within each of the three extracellular loops (A, C, and E) of the M23 isoform of human AQP4. The effects of each mutation on OAP array formation and AQP4 rAb binding were evaluated to define distinct and not previously appreciated patterns of antigen recognition. CSF was obtained from five NMO-IgG seropositive patients 1–8 weeks after the onset of unilateral monosymptomatic optic neuritis or transverse myelitis as part of their standard clinical care. The clinical testing of each patient's serum for NMO-IgG was performed at the Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Rochester, MN, using their standardized commercial clinical assay. Informed consent was obtained for all individuals prior to participation in this study. CSF cell collection, fluorescent labeling, and cell sorting of CD138+ CSF plasma cells and plasmablasts were performed as described (3.Bennett J.L. Lam C. Kalluri S.R. Saikali P. Bautista K.

Neurol. 2009; 66: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Cells were first selected in the size range of lymphocytes and plasma cells by forward and side light scattering. CD138+ cells were then identified and sorted into single wells of a 96-well PCR plate containing 20 μl of 1× RT buffer. cDNA synthesis, nested PCR amplification, and purification of PCR products were performed as described (3.Bennett J.L.

Sequences were analyzed and edited with 4Peaks software (Mek&Tosj.com) and then aligned to functional human immunoglobulin germline sequences using IMGT/V-QUEST. rAbs were produced from NMO CSF plasma cell and plasmablast clonal populations using a dual vector transient transfection system. VH and VL PCR products were cloned into the expression vectors pIgG1FLAG and pCEP4, respectively, as described. Final constructs were sequenced and verified. Constructs were co-transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, the cells were grown for 6–7 days in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); the supernatant was harvested, fresh medium was added, and cells were propagated for 6–7 days. The cell culture supernatant was subsequently removed and combined with the previous collection. The cell culture supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet cells and debris. Cell-free supernatants were passed twice through protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), and rAbs were eluted in 0.1 m glycine, 1 m NaCl, pH 3.0, and neutralized by the addition of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Recombinant IgG was subsequently exchanged and concentrated in storage buffer (PBS + 0.1% IgG/protease-free BSA) using Ultracell YM-30 microconcentrators (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Antibody integrity was confirmed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and the IgG concentration was determined by a human IgG capture ELISA or by BCA colorimetric protein quantification (Pierce). The specificity of each rAb used in this study was confirmed either by FACS or by fluorescence immunostaining of mock- and AQP4-expressing cells (3.Bennett J.L. Lam C. Kalluri S.R. Saikali P.

Both 4–6 amino acid serial alanine or glycine substitutions and point mutations were introduced into M23 AQP4 extracellular loops using the PCR-based GeneArt site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen) (Table 1). Partially overlapping sense and antisense primers were designed from the M23 AQP4 sequence with the desired nucleotide mutation(s) located near the center of each primer sequence. Methylation and mutagenesis reactions of AQP4 DNA were done using 20–25 ng of target AQP4 plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. AQP4 DNA mutations were confirmed by sequencing, and endonuclease-free plasmid DNA was purified for transfection into mammalian cells (Qiagen catalog no. 12362).TABLE 1Mutations introduced into the extracellular domains of AQP4AQP4 mutationaThe indicated amino acids located within the A, C, and E extracellular domains of the M23 isoform of human aquaporin 4 were mutated to alanine and or glycine residues as shown in column 2.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid DNA containing M23-AQP4 or mutated M23-AQP4 was then transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 into U-87MG or HEK293 EBNA cells growing on poly-l-ornithine-treated coverslips. Cells were incubated for ∼24 h at 37 °C, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Coverslips were stored at −20 °C until used. Plasmid DNA containing the AQP4-M23 cDNA sequence or the loop A mutant, ΔA3, cDNA sequence were linearized with PvuI for 1 h at 37 °C and then transfected into U-87MG astrocytoma cells with Lipofectamine 2000 per manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h post-transfection, G418 was added at a concentration of 400 μg/ml, and cells were monitored for survival. After ∼1 week, growing clonal populations were diluted in U-87MG selection media (DMEM high glucose media containing 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 300 μg/ml G418) to less than 10 cells/ml, and 100 μl were deposited into a 96-well plates. Plates were monitored 1–2 weeks for clonal growth and then 5–6 individual wells were eluted and expanded into a T75 flask. G418 selection was maintained at 200 μg/ml, and then cells were passaged and seeded onto coverslips to assess AQP4 expression. NMO rAbs were assayed for binding as described below. Cells on coverslips were blocked in 10% normal goat serum (NGS)/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Individual AQP4-positive rAbs at 10–20 μg/ml in 5% NGS/PBS were then applied to coverslips and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The concentration of Ab represented concentrations at or below their apparent Kd values. A secondary control M23-transfected coverslip that was used to correct for background staining of the Alexa Fluor 488 anti-human secondary antibody alone was included and remained in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed four times in 1× PBS for 3–5 min each, fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then blocked in 5% NGS/PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. All coverslips were then incubated with 4 μg/ml of a rabbit polyclonal anti-human AQP4 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 2% NGS/PBS for 1 h at room temperature to normalize for transfection efficiency. Coverslips were washed and incubated with 1:600–1:1000 dilutions of both a goat anti-human Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 Ab in 2% NGS/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed five times with 1× PBS for 3–5 min each and mounted onto clean microscope slides using Vectashield HardSet Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Immunostained coverslips were visualized on a Nikon E800 fluorescence microscope or on an Olympus IX81 confocal fluorescence microscope using either ×20 or ×40 objective lens. Images were acquired from 4 to 8 nonoverlapping visual fields per coverslip, and images were processed using AxioVision 4.8 software. For studies of Ab binding to AQP4 extracellular loop mutations, 2–5 independently transfected coverslips and 10–30 images were processed for quantitative analyses. The binding intensities of individual NMO rAbs (green fluorescence) and the C-terminal specific positive control anti-AQP4 rabbit polyclonal Ab (red fluorescence) were measured using ImageJ software, and the average background binding of anti-human secondary Ab (green fluorescence) alone to coverslips was subtracted, which typically represented 0.1–3% of rAb binding levels. The average ratio of NMO rAb to control polyclonal Ab (green/red) was calculated for each rAb and wildtype M23 AQP4 to normalize for AQP4 expression and the ratio of the fraction antibody bound on mutant and wildtype M23 AQP4 was then computed and reported as % M23 binding ± S.E. using Equation 1,% M23 Binding=Mutant(Green/Red)M23(Green/Red)×100(Eq. 1) The statistical effect of each mutation on binding to M23AQP4 was determined using an unpaired two-sided Student's t test with unequal variances. Transfected U-87MG cells were collected 24–48 h post-transfection, washed in cold PBS, and lysed in native PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% dodecyl-β-d-maltose. Samples were then electrophoresed through blue native gels, transferred onto PVDF membrane, and probed with a polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody against the intracellular C terminus of AQP4 Ab as described (10.Crane J.M. Lam C. Rossi A. Gupta T. Bennett J.L. Verkman A.S. Binding affinity and specificity of neuromyelitis optica autoantibodies to aquaporin-4 M1/M23 isoforms and orthogonal arrays.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16516-16524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Formation of OAPs was visualized by the characteristic ladder appearance (Fig. 1). Alternatively, OAP formation in transfected cells was visualized for some mutations by TIRF microscopy revealing a characteristic punctate staining at the cell surface (Fig. 1). The effects of serial and point mutations on tetramer and OAP formation are reported for each construct in Table 1. For SDS-PAGE analysis of NMO rAb binding to AQP4 M23, low speed cell lysates were prepared from AQP4-transfected cells and quantified by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and 20 μg of protein were resolved on a SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, dissected into individual lanes, blocked in 3% BSA, and then incubated with 1–2 μg/ml of the indicated NMO CSF-derived human rAb or the polyclonal anti-rabbit intracellular AQP4 Ab. Nitrocellulose strips were then washed in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween 20), incubated with goat anti-human HRP- or goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in 3% BSA, and then rewashed in TBS/Tween 20. Binding was visualized by chemiluminescence (Supersignal West Pico kit, Pierce). The three-dimensional mapping of putative AQP4 epitopes was based on the crystal structure of human M1-AQP4 (Protein Data Bank code 3DG8) at 1.8 Å (16.Ho J.D. Yeh R. Sandstrom A. Chorny I. Harries W.E. Robbins R.A. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Crystal structure of human aquaporin 4 at 1.8 A and its mechanism of conductance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7437-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional images of AQP4 monomers and tetramers were obtained and manipulated using Jmol Viewer at the Protein Data Bank. False colorations of AQP4 extracellular domains were performed manually on exported images using Adobe Photoshop. FACS single-cell sorting was used to isolate single CD138+ antibody-secreting cells from the CSF of five NMO-IgG-positive patients. Sequencing of their PCR-amplified heavy- and light-chain variable regions identified clonal populations within each repertoire, and Abs were generated from each clone as described previously (3.Bennett J.L. Lam C. Kalluri S.R. Saikali P. Bautista K. Dupree C. Glogowska M. Case D. Antel J.P. Owens G.P. Gilden D. Nessler S. Stadelmann C. Hemmer B. Intrathecal pathogenic anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies in early neuromyelitis optica.Ann. Neurol. 2009; 66: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). NMO CSF-derived rAbs specific for AQP4 failed to recognize denatured AQP4 protein monomers in SDS-PAGE protein immunoblots of lysates from AQP4-transfected CHOK1 cells (Fig. 2), indicating that CSF-derived Abs likely recognize conformational epitopes formed by the assembly of AQP4 tetramers and OAPs at the cell surface. To define regions of the AQP4 extracellular domain important for Ab recognition, we first introduced a series of alanine and/or glycine substitutions into the three extracellular domains of human M23 AQP4 as listed in Table 1. This included three sets of nonoverlapping serial substitutions covering loop A (ΔA1-ΔA3) and loop C (ΔC1-ΔC3), and one serial substitution that covers loop E (ΔE1). Plasmid DNA of each mutation and M23 AQP4 were separately transfected into U-87MG glioblastoma or HEK-EBNA cell lines, and binding to AQP4 was assayed by a dual immunostaining protocol in which AQP4 was immunostained using a polyclonal Ab recognizing the intracellular AQP4 C terminus. The double staining of normal and mutated AQP4-transfected cells with ONO7-5 #53 rAb (green fluorescence) and the AQP4-positive control Ab (red fluorescence) are shown in Fig. 3A. Whereas binding of the positive control Ab is largely unaltered in cells expressing AQP4 serial extracellular loop substitutions, binding of rAb #53 is absent in cells expressing the ΔC1-ΔC3 and ΔE1 mutations.

https://openalex.org/W1985302085,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important opportunistic pathogen that causes both healthcare- and community-acquired infections. An increase in the incidence of these infections may lead to a substantial change in the rate of vancomycin usage. Incidence of reduced susceptibility to vancomycin has been increasing worldwide for the last few years, conferring different levels of resistance to vancomycin as well as producing changes in the cell wall structure. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of vancomycin on cell wall thickening in clinical isolates of vancomycin-tolerant (VT) MRSA obtained from pediatric patients. From a collection of 100 MRSA clinical isolates from pediatric patients, 12% (12/100) were characterized as VT-MRSA, and from them, 41.66% (5/12) exhibited the heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) phenotype. Multiplex-PCR assays revealed 66.66% (8/12), 25% (3/12), and 8.33% (1/12) of the VT-MRSA isolates were associated with agr group II, I, and III polymorphisms, respectively; the II-mec gene was amplified from 83.3% (10/12) of the isolates, and the mecIVa gene was amplified from 16.66% (2/12) of the isolates. Pulsed field electrophoresis (PFGE) fingerprint analysis showed 62% similarity among the VT-MRSA isolates. Thin transverse sections analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed an average increase of 24 nm (105.55%) in the cell wall thickness of VT-MRSA compared with untreated VT-MRSA isolates. In summary, these data revealed that the thickened cell walls of VT-MRSA clinical isolates with agr type II and SCCmec group II polymorphisms are associated with an adaptive resistance to vancomycin."
https://openalex.org/W2014606060,"In the placenta, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) limits fetal glucocorticoid exposure and its inhibition has been associated to low birth weight. Its expression, encoded by the HSD11B2 gene is regulated by DNA methylation. We hypothesized that maternal diets supplemented with folic acid (FA) during pregnancy modify the expression of placental HSD11B2 through gene methylation. Wistar rats were fed with high (8 mg/kg) or normal low (1mg/kg, control) levels of FA during pregnancy. Concentrations of mRNA and protein in placentas were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Methylation in five CpG sites of the placental HSD11B2 promoter (−378 to −275) was analyzed by bacterial cloning and subsequent sequencing. In the FA-supplemented group, mRNA and protein levels of 11β-HSD2 decreased by 58% and increased by 89%, respectively, only in placentas attached to males. In controls, most CpG sites were not methylated except for the CpG2 site which was 80% methylated. CpG2 methylation level increased under the FA treatment; however, only in placentas attached to females was this increase significant (113%). This change was not related to HSD11B2 expression. Fetal weight of females from FA- supplemented mothers was 6% higher than females from control mothers. In conclusion, this is the first study reporting that FA over supplementation during pregnancy modifies the placental HSD11B2 gene expression and methylation in a sex-dependent manner, suggesting that maternal diets with high content of FA can induce early sex-specific responses, which may lead to long-term consequences for the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2035607534,"Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae bacteria in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is conferred by the Prf recognition complex, composed of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeats protein Prf and the protein kinase Pto. The complex is activated by recognition of the P. syringae effectors AvrPto and AvrPtoB. The N-terminal domain is responsible for Prf homodimerization, which brings two Pto kinases into close proximity and holds them in inactive conformation in the absence of either effector. Negative regulation is lost by effector binding to the catalytic cleft of Pto, leading to disruption of its P+1 loop within the activation segment. This change is translated through Prf to a second Pto molecule in the complex. Here we describe a schematic model of the unique Prf N-terminal domain dimer and its interaction with the effector binding determinant Pto. Using heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, we define multiple sites of N domain homotypic interaction and infer that it forms a parallel dimer folded centrally to enable contact between the N and C termini. Furthermore, we found independent binding sites for Pto at either end of the N-terminal domain. Using the constitutively active mutant ptoL205D, we identify a potential repression site for Pto in the first ∼100 amino acids of Prf.

https://openalex.org/W2004586376,"The success of global treatment as prevention (TasP) efforts for individuals living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is dependent on successful implementation, and therefore the appropriate contribution of social and behavioral science to these efforts. Understanding the psychosocial context of condomless sex among PLWHA could shed light on effective points of intervention. HPTN 063 was an observational mixed-methods study of sexually active, in-care PLWHA in Thailand, Zambia, and Brazil as a foundation for integrating secondary HIV prevention into HIV treatment. From 2010–2012, 80 qualitative interviews were conducted with PLWHA receiving HIV care and reported recent sexual risk. Thirty men who have sex with women (MSW) and 30 women who have sex with men (WSM) participated in equal numbers across the sites. Thailand and Brazil also enrolled 20 biologically-born men who have sex with men (MSM). Part of the interview focused on the impact of HIV on sexual practices and relationships. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated into English and examined using qualitative descriptive analysis. The mean age was 25 (SD = 3.2). There were numerous similarities in experiences and attitudes between MSM, MSW and WSM across the three settings. Participants had a high degree of HIV transmission risk awareness and practiced some protective sexual behaviors such as reduced sexual activity, increased use of condoms, and external ejaculation. Themes related to risk behavior can be categorized according to struggles for intimacy and fears of isolation, including: fear of infecting a sex partner, guilt about sex, sexual communication difficulty, HIV-stigma, and worry about sexual partnerships. Emphasizing sexual health, intimacy and protective practices as components of nonjudgmental sex-positive secondary HIV prevention interventions is recommended. For in-care PLWHA, this approach has the potential to support TasP. The overlap of themes across groups and countries indicates that similar intervention content may be effective for a range of settings."
https://openalex.org/W2052148251,"Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family that binds to a heterodimeric receptor consisting of IL-22 receptor 1 (IL-22R1) and IL-10R2. IL-22R expression was initially characterized on epithelial cells, and plays an essential role in a number of inflammatory diseases. Recently, a functional receptor was detected on cancer cells such as hepatocarcinoma and lung carcinoma, but its presence was not reported in glioblastoma (GBM). Two GBM cell lines and 10 primary cell lines established from patients undergoing surgery for malignant GBM were used to investigate the expression of IL-22 and IL-22R by using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and confocal microscopy studies. The role of IL-22 in proliferation and survival of GBM cell lines was investigated in vitro by BrdU and ELISA cell death assays. We report herein that the two subunits of the IL-22R complex are expressed on human GBM cells. Their activation, depending on exogenous IL-22, induced antiapoptotic effect and cell proliferation. IL-22 treatment of GBM cells resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated Akt, STAT3 signaling protein and its downstream antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL and decreased level of phosphorylated ERK1/2. In addition, IL-22R subunits were expressed in all the 10 tested primary cell lines established from GBM tumors. Our results showed that IL-22R is expressed on GBM established and primary cell lines. Depending on STAT3, ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways, IL-22 induced GBM cell survival. These data are consistent with a potential role of IL-22R in tumorigenesis of GBM. Since endogenous IL-22 was not detected in all studied GBM cells, we hypothesize that IL-22R could be activated by immune microenvironmental IL-22 producing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021003619,"We have published that pharmacological induction of oxidative stress (OS) causes anxiety-like behavior in rats. Using animal models, we also have established that psychological stress induces OS and leads to anxiety-like behaviors. All evidence points towards the causal role of OS in anxiety-like behaviors. To fully ascertain the role of OS in anxiety-like behaviors, it is reasonable to test whether the pro-anxiety effects of anxiogenic drugs caffeine or N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142) can be mitigated using agents that minimize OS. In this study, osmotic pumps were either filled with antioxidant tempol or saline. The pumps were attached to the catheter leading to the brain cannula and inserted into the subcutaneous pocket in the back pocket of the rat. Continuous i.c.v. infusion of saline or tempol in the lateral ventricle of the brain (4.3mmol/day) was maintained for 1 week. Rats were intraperitoneally injected either with saline or an anxiogenic drug one at a time. Two hours later all groups were subjected to behavioral assessments. Anxiety-like behavior tests (open-field, light-dark and elevated plus maze) suggested that tempol prevented anxiogenic drug-induced anxiety-like behavior in rats. Furthermore, anxiogenic drug-induced increase in stress examined via plasma corticosterone and increased oxidative stress levels assessed via plasma 8-isoprostane were prevented with tempol treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2118207106,"In this paper, we propose a full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) scheme, which evaluates image fidelity from two aspects: the inter-patch similarity and the intra-patch similarity. The scheme is performed in a patch-wise fashion so that a quality map can be obtained. On one hand, we investigate the disparity between one image patch and its adjacent ones. This disparity is visually described by an inter-patch feature, where the hybrid effect of luminance masking and contrast masking is taken into account. The inter-patch similarity is further measured by modifying the normalized correlation coefficient (NCC). On the other hand, we also attach importance to the impact of image contents within one patch on the IQA problem. For the intra-patch feature, we consider image curvature as an important complement of image gradient. According to local image contents, the intra-patch similarity is measured by adaptively comparing image curvature and gradient. Besides, a nonlinear integration of the inter-patch and intra-patch similarity is presented to obtain an overall score of image quality. The experiments conducted on six publicly available image databases show that our scheme achieves better performance in comparison with several state-of-the-art schemes."
https://openalex.org/W2023764634,"Background Sparganosis caused by invasion of the plerocercoid larvae (spargana) of Spirometra erinaceieuropaei have increased in recent years in China. However, the population genetic structure regarding this parasite is still unclear. In this study, we used the sequences of two mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (cytb) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) to analyze genetic variation and phylogeographic structure of the S. erinaceieuropaei populations. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 88 S. erinaceieuropaei isolates were collected from naturally infected frogs in 14 geographical locations of China. The complete cytb and cox1 genes of each sample was amplified and sequenced. Total 61 haplotypes were found in these 88 concatenated sequences. Each sampled population and the total population have high haplotype diversity (Hd), accompanied by very low nucleotide diversity (Pi). Phylogenetic analyses of haplotypes revealed two distinct clades (HeN+HuN+GZ-AS clade and GX+HN+GZ-GY clade) corresponding two sub-networks yielded by the median-joining network. Pairwise FST values supported great genetic differentiation between S. erinaceieuropaei populations. Both negative Fu’s FS value of neutrality tests and unimodal curve of mismatch distribution analyses supported demographic population expansion in the HeN+HuN+GZ-AS clade. The BEAST analysis showed that the divergence time between the two clades took place in the early Pleistocene (1.16 Myr), and by Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) an expansion occurred after about 0.3 Myr ago. Conclusions S. erinaceieuropaei from central and southern China has significant phylogeographic structure, and climatic oscillations during glacial periods in the Quaternary may affect the demography and diversification of this species."

The structure of the complex between the starch debranching enzyme barley limit dextrinase (LD), hydrolyzing α-1,6-glucosidic linkages, and its endogenous inhibitor (LDI) was solved at 2.7 Å. The structure reveals an entirely new and unexpected binding mode of LDI as compared with previously solved complex structures of related cereal type family inhibitors (CTIs) bound to glycoside hydrolases but is structurally analogous to binding of dual specificity CTIs to proteases. Site-directed mutagenesis establishes that a hydrophobic cluster flanked by ionic interactions in the protein-protein interface is vital for the picomolar affinity of LDI to LD as assessed by analysis of binding by using surface plasmon resonance and also supported by LDI inhibition of the enzyme activity. A phylogenetic analysis identified four LDI-like proteins in cereals among the 45 sequences from monocot databases that could be classified as unique CTI sequences. The unprecedented binding mechanism shown here for LDI has likely evolved in cereals from a need for effective inhibition of debranching enzymes having characteristic open active site architecture. The findings give a mechanistic rationale for the potency of LD activity regulation and provide a molecular understanding of the debranching events associated with optimal starch mobilization and utilization during germination. This study unveils a hitherto not recognized structural basis for the features endowing diversity to CTIs.

https://openalex.org/W2012929040,"The spontaneous emergence of contraction-inducing electrical activity in the uterus at the beginning of labor remains poorly understood, partly due to the seemingly contradictory observation that isolated uterine cells are not spontaneously active. It is known, however, that the expression of gap junctions increases dramatically in the approach to parturition, by more than one order of magnitude, which results in a significant increase in inter-cellular electrical coupling. In this paper, we build upon previous studies of the activity of electrically excitable smooth muscle cells (myocytes) and investigate the mechanism through which the coupling of these cells to electrically passive cells results in the generation of spontaneous activity in the uterus. Using a recently developed, realistic model of uterine muscle cell dynamics, we investigate a system consisting of a myocyte coupled to passive cells. We then extend our analysis to a simple two-dimensional lattice model of the tissue, with each myocyte being coupled to its neighbors, as well as to a random number of passive cells. We observe that different dynamical regimes can be observed over a range of gap junction conductances: at low coupling strength, corresponding to values measured long before delivery, the activity is confined to cell clusters, while the activity for high coupling, compatible with values measured shortly before delivery, may spread across the entire tissue. Additionally, we find that the system supports the spontaneous generation of spiral wave activity. Our results are both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with observations from in vitro experiments. In particular, we demonstrate that the increase in inter-cellular electrical coupling observed experimentally strongly facilitates the appearance of spontaneous action potentials that may eventually lead to parturition."
https://openalex.org/W1969959302,"Among the methods used to screen transgenic microalgae, antibiotics selection has raised environmental and food safety concerns, while the observation of fluorescence proteins could be influenced by the endogenous fluorescence of host chloroplasts. As an alternative, this study isolated the purple chromoprotein (CP) from Stichodacyla haddoni (shCP). A plasmid in which shCP cDNA is driven by a heat-inducible promoter was linearized and electroporated into 2.5×10(8) protoplasts of Nannochloropsis oculata. Following regeneration and cultivation on an f/2 medium plate for two weeks, we observed 26 colonies that displayed a slightly dark green coloration. After individually subculturing and performing five hours of heat shock at 42°C, a dark brown color was mosaically displayed in five of these colonies, indicating that both untransformed and transformed cells were mixed together in each colony. To obtain a uniform expression of shCP throughout the whole colony, we continuously isolated each transformed cell that exhibited brown coloration and subcultured it on a fresh plate, resulting in the generation of five transgenic lines of N. oculata which stably harbored the shCP gene for at least 22 months, as confirmed by PCR detection and observation by the naked eye. As shown by Western blot, exogenous shCP protein was expressed in these transgenic microalgae. Since shCP protein is biodegradable and originates from a marine organism, both environmental and food safety concerns have been eliminated, making this novel shCP reporter gene a simple, but effective and ecologically safe, marker for screening and isolating transgenic microalgae."
https://openalex.org/W1980213746,"The riboflavin biosynthesis pathway has been shown to be essential in many pathogens and is absent in humans. Therefore, enzymes involved in riboflavin synthesis are considered as potential antibacterial drug targets. The enzyme 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DHBPS) catalyzes one of the two committed steps in the riboflavin pathway and converts d-ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) to l-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate and formate. Moreover, DHBPS is shown to be indispensable for Mycobacterium, Salmonella, and Helicobacter species. Despite the essentiality of this enzyme in bacteria, no inhibitor has been identified hitherto. Here, we describe kinetic and crystal structure characterization of DHBPS from Vibrio cholerae (vDHBPS) with a competitive inhibitor 4-phospho-d-erythronohydroxamic acid (4PEH) at 1.86-Å resolution. In addition, we also report the structural characterization of vDHBPS in its apo form and in complex with its substrate and substrate plus metal ions at 1.96-, 1.59-, and 2.04-Å resolution, respectively. Comparison of these crystal structures suggests that 4PEH inhibits the catalytic activity of DHBPS as it is unable to form a proposed intermediate that is crucial for DHBPS activity. Furthermore, vDHBPS structures complexed with substrate and metal ions reveal that, unlike Candida albicans, binding of substrate to vDHBPS induces a conformational change from an open to closed conformation. Interestingly, the position of second metal ion, which is different from that of Methanococcus jannaschii, strongly supports an active role in the catalytic mechanism. Thus, the kinetic and structural characterization of vDHBPS reveals the molecular mechanism of inhibition shown by 4PEH and that it can be explored further for designing novel antibiotics.Background: 3,4-Dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DHBPS) is essential for many pathogens and is absent in humans.Results: We have characterized DHBPS from Vibrio cholerae in the presence of substrate d-ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) and inhibitor 4-phospho-d-erythronohydroxamic acid (4PEH).Conclusion: 4PEH inhibits DHBPS competitively and interacts with enzyme similarly to the substrate.Significance: 4PEH can be used as a lead molecule for designing novel antibiotics.

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a universal precursor for the synthesis of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FMN and FAD are essential cofactors for many proteins that are involved in cellular and physiological processes including carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (1.Bacher A. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 349-370Google Scholar). Humans and animals obtain riboflavin from their diet, whereas it is biosynthesized in most bacteria as they are devoid of any riboflavin transporters (2.Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D.

Nevertheless, certain differences observed in the existing structures prevent us from predicting the molecular mechanism of DHBPS completely. For example, DHBPS from C. albicans (34.Echt S. Bauer S.

https://openalex.org/W2325685918,"A major risk for astronauts during prolonged space flight is infection as a result of the combined effects of microgravity, situational and confinement stress, alterations in food intake, altered circadian rhythm, and radiation that can significantly impair the immune system and the body’s defense systems. We previously reported a massive increase in morbidity with a decrease in the ability to control a bacterial challenge when mice were maintained under hindlimb suspension (HS) conditions and exposed to solar particle event (SPE)-like radiation. HS and SPE-like radiation treatment alone resulted in a borderline significant increase in morbidity. Therefore, development and testing of countermeasures that can be used during extended space missions in the setting of exposure to SPE radiation becomes a serious need. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of enrofloxacin (an orally bioavailable antibiotic) and Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Neulasta) on enhancing resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice subjected to HS and SPE-like radiation. The results revealed that treatment with enrofloxacin or G-CSF enhanced bacterial clearance and significantly decreased morbidity and mortality in challenged mice exposed to suspension and radiation. These results establish that antibiotics, such as enrofloxacin, and G-CSF could be effective countermeasures to decrease the risk of bacterial infections after exposure to SPE radiation during extended space flight, thereby reducing both the risk to the crew and the danger of mission failure."
https://openalex.org/W2068344184,"Understanding the transmission and movement of Plasmodium parasites is crucial for malaria elimination and prevention of resurgence. Located at the limit of malaria transmission in the Pacific, Vanuatu is an ideal candidate for elimination programs due to low endemicity and the isolated nature of its island setting. We analyzed the variation in the merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) and the circumsporozoite protein (csp) of P. falciparum and P. vivax populations to examine the patterns of gene flow and population structures among seven sites on five islands in Vanuatu. Genetic diversity was in general higher in P. vivax than P. falciparum from the same site. In P. vivax, high genetic diversity was likely maintained by greater extent of gene flow among sites and among islands. Consistent with the different patterns of gene flow, the proportion of genetic variance found among islands was substantially higher in P. falciparum (28.81–31.23%) than in P. vivax (-0.53–3.99%). Our data suggest that the current island-by-island malaria elimination strategy in Vanuatu, while adequate for P. falciparum elimination, might need to be complemented with more centrally integrated measures to control P. vivax movement across islands."
https://openalex.org/W2029141390,"Regulators of chromatin structure and gene expression contribute to tumor formation and progression. The co-repressor CoREST1 regulates the localization and activity of associated histone modifying enzymes including lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Although several CoREST1 associated proteins have been reported to enhance breast cancer progression, the role of CoREST1 in breast cancer is currently unclear. Here we report that knockdown of CoREST1 in the basal-type breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, led to significantly reduced incidence and diminished size of tumors compared to controls in mouse xenograft studies. Notably, CoREST1-depleted cells gave rise to tumors with a marked decrease in angiogenesis. CoREST1 knockdown led to a decrease in secreted angiogenic and inflammatory factors, and mRNA analysis suggests that CoREST1 promotes expression of genes related to angiogenesis and inflammation including VEGF-A and CCL2. CoREST1 knockdown decreased the ability of MDA-MB-231 conditioned media to promote endothelial cell tube formation and migration. Further, tumors derived from CoREST1-depleted cells had reduced macrophage infiltration and the secretome of CoREST1 knockdown cells was deficient in promoting macrophage migration and macrophage-mediated angiogenesis. Taken together, these findings reveal that the epigenetic regulator CoREST1 promotes tumorigenesis in a breast cancer model at least in part through regulation of gene expression patterns in tumor cells that have profound non-cell autonomous effects on endothelial and inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2077911267,"Reducing information rents is an important task for government agencies wishing to purchase maximal environmental services with limited budgets. This paper reports on several green auction options for reducing information rents and improving the performance of the “Grain for Green” Payments for environmental services (PES) program implemented in northwestern China. In r experimental auctions and investigations, door-to-door interviews were conducted and bidding envelopes and survey questionnaires were used to determine the offers and the foregone profits of the participants. Three scenarios are analyzed in this paper: a uniform price auction, a discriminatory price auction, and an opportunity-cost system. The results show that compared to the uniform price auction system, the other auction systems can increase the cost-effectiveness of conservation contracting. Competitive bidding can reveal true opportunity costs and can reduce information rents extracted from the government by farmers using private information. The demographics and average bids of these auction types were also analyzed. “Perfect information” in the opportunity-cost offer system has the best performance but is very hard to implement in reality. The results of this research show that the auction is a valuable tool for purchasing conservation contracts in northwestern China, but that in the future, the performance of these auctions should be studied with relaxed model assumptions."
