https://openalex.org/W2081359387,"A definition based on alpha-carbon positions and a sample of 215 alpha helices from 45 different globular protein structures were used to tabulate amino acid preferences for 16 individual positions relative to the helix ends. The interface residue, which is half in and half out of the helix, is called the N-cap or C-cap, whichever is appropriate. The results confirm earlier observations, such as asymmetrical charge distributions in the first and last helical turn, but several new, sharp preferences are found as well. The most striking of these are a 3.5:1 preference for Asn at the N-cap position, and a preference of 2.6:1 for Pro at N-cap + 1. The C-cap position is overwhelmingly dominated by Gly, which ends 34 percent of the helices. Hydrophobic residues peak at positions N-cap + 4 and C-cap - 4."
https://openalex.org/W2028916500,"Any loss of cochlear hair cells has been presumed to result in a permanent hearing deficit because the production of these cells normally ceases before birth. However, after acoustic trauma, injured sensory cells in the mature cochlea of the chicken are replaced. New cells appear to be produced by mitosis of supporting cells that survive at the lesion site and do not divide in the absence of trauma. This trauma-induced division of normally postmitotic cells may lead to recovery from profound hearing loss."
https://openalex.org/W2026120980,"Recovery of hair cells was studied at various times after acoustic trauma in adult quail. An initial loss of hair cells recovered to within 5 percent of the original number of cells. Tritium-labeled thymidine was injected after this acoustic trauma to determine if mitosis played a role in recovery of hair cells. Within 10 days of acoustic trauma, incorporation of [3H]thymidine was seen over the nuclei of hair cells and supporting cells in the region of initial hair cell loss. Thus, hair cell regeneration can occur after embryonic terminal mitosis."

An alternating photocurrent through an electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor interface provides a highly sensitive means to measure such potential changes. A spatially selectable photoresponse permits the determination of a multiplicity of chemical events with a single semiconductor device."
https://openalex.org/W1550810733,"The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) is subject to multivalent feedback suppression mediated by sterols and non-sterol substances derived from mevalonate, the product of the enzyme. To dissect the mechanism for this multivalent effect, Chinese hamster ovary cells were incubated with sterols contained in plasma lipoproteins and with a high concentration (100 microM) of compactin, an inhibitor of the reductase. Under these conditions, the amounts of HMG-CoA reductase protein and catalytic activity were high, although the cells were saturated with sterols, as reflected by active synthesis of cholesteryl esters. The amount of enzyme fell by 99% when the cells received excess mevalonate in addition to sterols. This decline was not associated with a fall in levels of reductase messenger RNA (mRNA). Rather, it was attributable to an 80% decline in translation of the mRNA, coupled with a 5-fold increase in the rate of degradation of reductase protein, as revealed by pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine. Considered together with previous data, these findings suggest a multilevel mechanism for multivalent regulation of HMG-CoA reductase. We suggest that sterols suppress the enzyme incompletely by partially repressing transcription of the gene and that nonsterol products derived from mevalonate further reduce the enzyme by inhibiting translation of the mRNA. Sterols and non-sterol products, acting together, accelerate the degradation of reductase protein. This combination of transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls can regulate the amount of reductase protein over a several hundred-fold range in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1556101864,"This study examines the myosin isozyme heterogeneity (in terms of both alkali light chains and myosin heavy chains) among skeletal muscle fibers of the rabbit and correlates these isozyme differences with the differences in a contractile property, the velocity of unloaded shortening, of the fibers. The mean velocities of unloaded shortening (pCa 4.3; 12 degrees C) were as follows: psoas IIb fibers, 2.07 fiber lengths/s (n = 25); tibialis anterior (IIb) fibers, 1.63 fiber lengths/s (n = 18); vastus intermedius IIa fibers, 0.98 fiber lengths/s (n = 15); fibers (IIa) from chronically stimulated tibialis anterior, 0.86 fiber lengths/s (n = 16). Peptide maps of the myosins showed that the myosin heavy chains of the two groups of IIb fibers were indistinguishable from each other, but different from the heavy chains of the IIa fibers. However, the difference in maximal shortening velocity of the two groups of IIb fibers was correlated with a difference in the alkali light chain ratio deduced from the intensity ratio of myosin isoforms separated by gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. The vastus intermedius (IIa) and chronically stimulated tibialis anterior (IIa) fibers were indistinguishable in terms of either velocities of unloaded shortening or myosin isozyme contents. Soleus fibers contained only slow-twitch myosin. Thus, among fibers that contained a variety of myosin isozymes, differences in shortening velocities were correlated with the alkali light chain ratio, myosin heavy chain type, or a combination of both."
https://openalex.org/W1559841125,"Previous studies have demonstrated that skeletal muscle from individuals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH) has a defect associated with the mechanism of calcium release from its intracellular storage sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In this report we demonstrate that the [3H]ryanodine receptor of isolated MH-susceptible (MHS) porcine heavy SR exhibits an altered Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding at the low affinity Ca2+ site as well as a lower Kd for ryanodine (92 versus 265 nM) when compared to normal porcine SR. The Bmax of the normal and MHS [3H] ryanodine receptor (9.3-12.6 pmol/mg) was not significantly different, and analysis of MHS and normal SR proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis did not reveal a significant difference in the intensity of Coomassie Blue staining of the spanning protein/ryanodine receptor region of the gels (Mr greater than 300,000). We also find that MHS porcine muscle intact fiber bundles exhibit a 5-10-fold lower ryanodine threshold for twitch and tetanus inhibition, and contracture onset when compared to normal muscle. Since the SR ryanodine receptor is a calcium release channel as well as a component intimately involved in transverse tubule-SR communication, abnormalities in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor may be responsible for the abnormal SR calcium release and contractile properties demonstrated by MHS muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2055328915,"Inbred male mice typically prefer to mate with females of a different, non-self H-2 haplotype. To determine whether this natural preference is irrevocable or results from familial imprinting, a test system was used which relied on previous observations that B6 males (H-2b) mate preferentially with congenic B6-H-2k rather than B6 females, and B6-H-2k males with B6 females. This preference was reversed in B6 males fostered by B6-H-2k parents and in B6-H-2k males fostered by B6 parents, preference in these cases favoring the same H-2 type. Thus, H-2 selective mating preference is acquired by imprinting on familial H-2 types."
https://openalex.org/W1507286155,"Synthesis of the iron storage protein ferritin is induced in rat liver by iron administration, the ferritin L subunit being preferentially stimulated over the H subunit. To examine the basis for this differential regulation of the two subunits, the transcription rates of the L and H genes, the total cellular levels of L and H subunit mRNA, and the distribution of the mRNAs between a stored ribonucleoprotein form and the polysomes were examined in rat liver at several times after iron injection. Iron caused a rapid increase in transcription of the L subunit gene, followed by a rise in L mRNA levels, whereas H subunit gene transcription and H mRNA levels did not increase significantly. Differential transcriptional regulation of ferritin L and H mRNA levels by iron contrasted with the coordinate control of the two subunit mRNAs at the translational level. On giving iron, there was a rapid and synchronous shift of both mRNAs from the ribonucleoprotein fraction onto the polysomes, the same proportion of each mRNA being mobilized. Thus, regulation of ferritin subunit synthesis at these two levels allows both a rapid translational response and a specific transcriptional response to increased intracellular iron levels."
https://openalex.org/W2010038629,"A specific, reversible binding site for a free amino acid is detectable on the intron of the Tetrahymena self-splicing ribosomal precursor RNA. The site selects arginine among the natural amino acids, and prefers the L- to the D-amino acid. The dissociation constant is in the millimolar range, and amino acid binding is at or in the catalytic rG splicing substrate site. Occupation of the G site by L-arginine therefore inhibits splicing by inhibiting the binding of rG, without inhibition of later reactions in the splicing reaction sequence. Arginine binding specificity seems to be directed at the side chain and the guanidino radical, and the alpha-amino and carboxyl groups are dispensable for binding. The arginine site can be placed within the G site by structural homology, with consequent implications for RNA-amino acid interaction, for the origin of the genetic code, for control of RNA activities, and for further catalytic capabilities for RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1589308736,"Lipid accounts for 40% of the dry weight of a mature Manduca sexta egg. Less than 1% of the total egg lipid is derived from de novo synthesis by the follicles. The remaining egg lipid originates in the fat body and is transported to the ovary by lipoproteins. Vitellogenin, the major egg yolk lipoprotein, accounts for 5% of the total egg lipid. The remaining 95% lipid is attributable to the hemolymph lipophorins, adult high density lipophorin (HDLp-A) and low density lipophorin (LDLp). When HDLp-A that is dual labeled with 3H in the diacylglycerol fraction and 35S in the protein moiety is incubated with follicles in vitro, the ratio of 3H:35S in the incubation medium does not vary and is similar to the ratio of the labels that are associated with the follicles. In an accompanying paper (Kawooya, J. K., Osir, E. O., and Law, J. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8740-8747), we show that HDLp-A is sequestered by the follicles without subsequent hydrolysis of its apoproteins. These results, together with those presented in this paper, support our conclusion that HDLp-A is not recycled back into the hemolymph after it is internalized by the follicles and, therefore, does not function as a reusable lipid shuttle between the fat body and the ovary. When follicles are incubated with dual labeled LDLp, the diacylglycerol component of the particle is internalized by the follicles without concomitant endocytosis of its associated apoproteins. This LDLp particle is the major vehicle by which lipid is delivered to the ovary."
https://openalex.org/W1541458650,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is a substrate for phosphorylation by the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) at Thr654. The hypothesis that this phosphorylation is causally related to the regulation of the functional properties of the EGF receptor was tested by substitution of Thr654 with an alanine residue. Activation of protein kinase C using phorbol ester caused a decrease in the high affinity binding of EGF to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing wild-type [Thr654]EGF receptors. Similar results were obtained with cells expressing mutated [Ala654]EGF receptors. The regulation of the protein kinase activity of the EGF receptor by protein kinase C was examined using a synthetic peptide substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation. Protein kinase C caused a Ca2+-dependent decrease in the tyrosine-protein kinase activity of the wild-type [Thr654]EGF receptor. In contrast, no inhibition of the tyrosine-protein kinase activity of the mutated [Ala654]EGF receptor caused by protein kinase C was detected. In further experiments, the desensitization of EGF action caused by the activation of protein kinase C was examined by investigating the regulation of the transferrin receptor by EGF. Phorbol ester was observed to cause the desensitization of signaling by the wild-type [Thr654] and mutated [Ala654]EGF receptors. These data are consistent with a role for the phosphorylation of EGF receptor Thr654 in the regulation of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase activity. However, the inhibition of the high affinity binding of EGF to cell-surface receptors caused by protein kinase C does not require Thr654. It is concluded that independent mechanisms account for the regulation by protein kinase C of the EGF receptor affinity and tyrosine-protein kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2057290809,"The rate of lateral diffusion of integral membrane proteins is constrained in cells, but the constraining factors for most membrane proteins have not been defined. PH-20, a sperm surface protein involved in sperm-egg adhesion, was shown to be anchored in the plasma membrane by attachment to the lipid phosphatidylinositol and to have a diffusion rate that is highly restricted on testicular sperm, being more than a thousand times slower than lipid diffusion. These results support the hypothesis that lateral mobility of a membrane protein can be regulated exclusively by interactions of its ectodomain."
https://openalex.org/W2053722205,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) is present in high concentrations in preovulatory follicular fluid, and ovarian follicular cells have specific Ang II receptors. To investigate the possible direct involvement of Ang II in ovulation the specific receptor antagonist of Ang II, saralasin, was administered by intraperitoneal injection to immature rats in which follicle development and ovulation had been induced with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), respectively. Saralasin halved the number of oocytes found in the fallopian tubes 17 to 20 hours after administration of hCG. The antiovulatory effect was observed when saralasin was given 1 hour before hCG or 1 or 3 hours after hCG but not when given 5 hours after hCG. Simultaneous administration of Ang II reversed the saralasin blockage of ovulation. These results indicate a direct, obligate role for Ang II in ovulation and raise the possibility of contraceptive and profertility applications for agonists or antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system that are aimed at the ovulatory process."
https://openalex.org/W2054062836,"Clinical and seroepidemiological studies in West Africa indicate that human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is widespread and associated with immunodeficiency states of variable degree. In this study, an isolate of HIV-2 from a patient in Senegal was molecularly cloned and characterized. This isolate (HIV-2ST) was shown by hybridization and restriction enzyme analysis to be more related to the prototype HIV-2ROD than to other human or primate retroviruses. Cultures of HIV-2ST showed genotypic polymorphism, and clones of the virus had transmembrane envelope glycoproteins of 30 and 42 kilodaltons. Unlike other immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-2ST did not cause cell death or induce cell fusion in peripheral blood lymphocytes or in any of four CD4+ cell lines tested. Although HIV-2ST entered cells by a CD4-dependent mechanism and replicated actively, cell-free transmission of the virus was retarded at the level of cell entry. These findings suggest that immunodeficiency viruses prevalent in West African populations are members of the HIV-2 virus group and that certain strains of this virus have attenuated virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1572773486,"In both primary cell cultures of rat hepatocytes and in liver, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were found to influence the accumulation of the cytochrome P-450c and P-450d mRNAs by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Following treatment with PAHs, cytochrome P-450c mRNA levels increased approximately 100-fold in both hepatocyte cultures and in liver, while transcription rates, measured by run-on transcription of isolated nuclei, increased 3-fold in hepatocyte cultures and 10-fold in liver. The difference in the -fold increases of mRNA level and transcription rate suggests that post-transcriptional, as well as transcriptional, mechanisms contributed to the regulation of cytochrome P-450c mRNA levels. Following treatment with PAHs, cytochrome P-450d mRNA levels increased 200-fold in hepatocyte cultures and 70-fold in liver, while transcription rates remained unchanged in hepatocyte cultures and increased only 1.7-fold in liver. This suggests that post-transcriptional mechanisms were of primary importance in regulating cytochrome P-450d mRNA levels. The newly developed hepatocyte primary cell culture system used in these studies differs from previously reported systems in that the cytochrome P-450d gene, as well as the cytochrome P-450c gene, were expressed in response to PAHs. In this cell culture system the regulation of these two genes was quite similar, although not identical, to that found in liver. The mechanisms controlling the tissue-specific expression of the genes encoding cytochromes P-450c and P-450d were also examined. The cytochrome P-450c mRNA was found in kidney, heart, and lung, as well as in liver, of PAH-treated rats, while the mature cytochrome P-450d mRNA was detected only in liver. The substantial increase in cytochrome P-450c mRNA in kidney in response to beta-napthoflavone was not associated with a detectable change in the transcription rate of cytochrome P-450c gene, indicating that cytochrome P-450c mRNA levels must be regulated primarily post-transcriptionally in kidney. Even though mature cytochrome P-450d mRNA could not be detected in kidney, the cytochrome P-450d gene was transcribed at a substantial rate in this tissue; therefore, the lack of accumulation of mature cytochrome P-450d mRNA in kidney must have been due to post-transcriptional control."
https://openalex.org/W1537220244,"The uptake of iron from transferrin by isolated rat hepatocytes varies in parallel with plasma membrane NADH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity, is inhibited by ferricyanide, ferric, and ferrous iron chelators, divalent transition metal cations, and depends on calcium ions. Iron uptake does not depend on endosomal acidification or endocytosis of transferrin. The results are compatible with a model in which iron, at transferrin concentrations above that needed to saturate the transferrin receptor, is taken up from transferrin predominantly by mechanisms located to or contiguous with the plasma membrane. The process involves labilization and reduction of transferrin-bound iron by cooperative proton and electron fluxes. A model which combines the plasma membrane mechanism and the receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1526028882,"The egg of Manduca sexta contains a very high density lipophorin (VHDLp-E; Mr approximately equal to 4.14 x 10(5), rho = 1.238 g/ml) that is derived from the high density lipophorin (HDLp-A; Mr approximately equal to 7.63 x 10(5), rho = 1.076 g/ml) of the hemolymph. The selective uptake of HDLp-A into the egg and its subsequent conversion to VHDLp-E was studied both in vivo and in vitro. Upon entering the egg, an estimated 530 mol of lipid were stripped from each mol of HDLp-A, and 68% of the diacylglycerol fraction was converted to triacylglycerol. In addition, the two molecules of the low molecular weight apolipoprotein, apolipophorin-III, of HDLp-A were dissociated from the lipophorin particle. The VHDLp-E thus formed consisted of 80% protein and 20% lipid, 75% of which was phospholipid. HDLp-A labeled in vivo with [35S]methionine in its apoprotein moiety was injected into females at the onset of egg development, and its incorporation in a series of follicles at different stages of growth was measured. There was increased accumulation of [35S]HDLp-A in the follicles as they matured. The apoproteins of [35S]HDLp-A were not hydrolyzed when the particle was internalized by the follicle. In the accompanying paper we have presented the evidence that the apoproteins of HDLp-A are retained in the follicles (Kawooya, J.K., and Law, J.H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8748-8753)."
https://openalex.org/W1482669154,"We have sought direct evidence for the in vivo expression of the human growth hormone-variant (hGH-V) gene by screening a placental cDNA library with a hGH-V-specific oligonucleotide. Nine independent hGH-V cDNA clones were isolated and analyzed, and three distinct species were detected. Five of these hGH-V cDNAs represent mRNAs spliced and processed in a pattern analogous to that of the highly homologous human growth hormone and human chorionic somatomammotropin gene transcripts. Each of the remaining four hGH-V cDNAs contains an additional segment of 253 nucleotides corresponding in position and sequence to the fourth intron of the hGH-V gene. In addition, one of the mRNAs in this second group uses an alternative downstream polyadenylation site. The alternatively spliced hGH-V mRNA, which we refer to as hGH-V2 mRNA, constitutes approximately 30% of the hGH-V transcripts both in the human term placenta and in a stable mouse fibroblast line expressing the transfected hGH-V gene. The placental expression of the hGH-V gene is specific to villous tissue. The hGH-V2 mRNA is predicted to encode a protein which substitutes the 65 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of hGH-V with a new 104-residue carboxyl terminus resulting in significant divergence in their relative physical properties. The alternative splicing of the hGH-V transcripts to hGH-V and hGH-V2 mRNAs expands the potential complexity of the hGH-V gene's role in normal placental function."
https://openalex.org/W2161591234,"The structures of sulfated N-linked oligosaccharides have been reported for a few specific proteins. We recently demonstrated that such oligosaccharides occur in many different types of tissue culture cell lines (Freeze, H. H., and Varki, A. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 140, 967-973). Here we report improved methods to metabolically label cell lines with 35SO4 and to release sulfated N-linked oligosaccharides with peptide:N-glycosidase F as well as the partial structure of some of these novel oligosaccharides. The released 35SO4-labeled chains from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CPAE) were characterized by gel filtration, anion exchange and lectin affinity chromatography, and various enzymatic and chemical treatments. Each cell line contains a class of sulfated oligosaccharide chains bearing from two to six negative charges in varying combinations of O-sulfate esters and sialic acids. These molecules represent a significant proportion of both the total 35SO4 label and the total anionic N-linked oligosaccharides. They are also relatively enriched in a CHO mutant that is deficient in glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis. Lectin affinity chromatography of such molecules from CPAE cells indicates that the majority are sialylated multiantennary complex-type chains. The sulfate esters are exclusively of the primary type. Sequential exoglycosidase digestions, including beta-hexosaminidase A treatment at low pH, demonstrate that at least one-third of these sulfate esters are found in the following structure, (formula; see text) where R is the remainder of the underlying oligosaccharide, and SA is sialic acid. In addition to these molecules, a more highly charged group of sulfated N-linked oligosaccharides sharing structural features with glycosaminoglycans was found in CPAE cells, but not in CHO cells. These are described in the following paper (Sundblad, G., Holojda, S., Roux, L., Varki, A., and Freeze, H. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8890-8896)."
https://openalex.org/W1495673643,"The crystal structure of the 7Fe ferredoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii has been redetermined using area detector data to 2.7-A resolution and a new derivative. Tetragonal crystals of the protein were maintained at pH 8.0. The results show that the structure previously reported was in error and confirms a recent independent report of the structure (Stout, G.H., Turley, S., Sieker, L. C., and Jensen, L. H. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, in press). The protein fold is similar to the homologous 8Fe ferredoxin structure for the N-terminal half of the protein; the C-terminal residues wrap around this structure. The structure contains a 3Fe cluster coordinated by cysteines 8, 16, and 49 and a 4Fe cluster coordinated by cysteines 20, 39, 42, and 45. However, there are two free sulfhydryls, cysteines 11 and 24, in the new model. Cysteine 24 is in contact with the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Cysteine 11 is shielded from solvent by residues 86-90."
https://openalex.org/W1514907603,"Transthyretin (TTR) is involved in the plasma transport of both retinol and thyroid hormones. TTR is synthesized in the liver and choroid plexus, and in small amounts in several other tissues. A study was conducted to determine the tissue sites of degradation and turnover of TTR in the rat. The study employed TTR labeled with tyramine cellobiose (TC) and the trapped ligand method. Samples of purified rat TTR were labeled either with 125I-TC or directly with 131I. A mixture of the two labeled TTRs was injected intravenously into six rats. Blood samples were collected via a venous catheter for kinetic (turnover) analysis. After 24 or 48 h, the rats were killed, and 23 different tissues/organs were assayed as possible sites of TTR degradation. Derivatization of TTR with TC did not appreciably alter TTR plasma kinetics. Plasma turnover data were best fit by a three-pool model. The mean fractional turnover of plasma TTR was 0.15/h, and of total body TTR 0.04/h. The major sites of TTR degradation were the liver (36-38% of total body TTR degradation, almost all in hepatocytes), muscle (12-15%), and skin (8-10%). Tissues that were sites of 1-8% of body TTR degradation included kidneys, adipose tissue, testes, and the gastrointestinal tract. Less than 1% of total TTR degradation occurred in the other tissues examined. A second study was conducted in which labeled TTR was injected intraventricularly into the cerebrospinal fluid in order to explore the degradation of TTR of choroid plexus origin. The kinetics of the appearance and disappearance of such labeled TTR in plasma were physiologically reasonable, with an estimated turnover of cerebrospinal fluid TTR of the order of 0.33/h. The major tissue sites of degradation of labeled TTR injected into cerebrospinal fluid and into plasma were approximately the same. No specific degradation of TTR was found in the nervous system tissues. The most active organs of TTR catabolism, per gram wet weight, were liver and kidneys. These studies demonstrate that many tissues participate in TTR turnover and degradation; the studies provide quantitative information about the tissue sites of TTR catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1600772876,"Immunoaffinity-purified DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex from calf thymus consists of subunits with molecular weights of 148,000-180,000, 73,000, 59,000, and 48,000 (Nasheuer, H.-P., and Grosse, F. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 8458-8466). Primase activity was separated from the immobilized complex by washing extensively with 2 M KCl or, alternatively, by shifting to pH 11.5 in the presence of 1 M KCl. From both elution procedures, the primase activity was found to be associated with the polypeptides with molecular weights of 59,000 and 48,000. The specific activity, using either elution procedure, was 30,000 units/mg. Both polypeptides sedimented together at 5.7 S upon zonal centrifugation on a sucrose gradient. Primase activity was found in the flow-through fraction after DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the free primase. Analysis of this fraction by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis revealed only one band with a Mr of 48,000. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the Mr 59,000 and 48,000 polypeptides. The anti-Mr 59,000 antibody affected the primase activity only marginally, whereas the anti-Mr 48,000 antibody inhibited the primase activity nearly completely. UV cross-linking of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex with alpha-32P-labeled GTP revealed a binding site at the Mr 48,000 polypeptide, but none at the other subunits of the complex. Taken together, these results suggest that the Mr 48,000 polypeptide bears the active site of the DNA primase activity. The Mr 59,000 polypeptide stabilizes the primase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2022586338,"Dopamine is the principal catecholamine neurotransmitter in the vertebrate retina. The shape of retinal neurons that accumulate dopamine has been demonstrated in an in vitro preparation of cat retina. This was achieved by the discovery that the combined uptake of dopamine and the indoleaminergic transmitter analog 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine leads to an intense, catecholamine-like fluorescence in the cell bodies and processes of presumed dopaminergic amacrine cells in the living retina. This fluorescence served as an in vitro marker for these cells, and their detailed morphology was analyzed after intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase under direct microscopic control. The horseradish peroxidase-filled cells show an unprecedented neuronal morphology: each cell gives rise to multiple, axon-like processes that arise from, and extend for millimeters beyond, the dendritic tree. The unique structure of this type of amacrine cell suggests a function for dopamine in long-range lateral interactions in the inner plexiform layer."
https://openalex.org/W1605669682,"Delipidation of partially purified outer membranes of Pseudomonas syringae by various delipidating agents resulted in a significant loss of ice nucleation activity associated with the cell envelopes of this and other ice nucleation active bacteria. Lipopolysaccharide depletion of such membranes caused no reduction in ice nucleation activity. Both phospholipid content and ice nucleation activity of membranes were decreased by a similar fractional amount with time after treatment with phospholipase A2. A proportional quantitative relationship between loss of ice nucleation activity and lipid removal with increasing concentrations of sodium cholate and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was also observed. Significant linear relationships between the amount of lipid removed by phospholipase A2, sodium cholate, and SDS and the loss of ice nucleation activity in P. syringae outer membranes were observed. However, the slopes of these linear relationships for membranes treated with phospholipase A2 (m = 0.80), SDS (m = 0.94), and sodium cholate (m = 0.53) differed. The lower slope value for cholate-treated membranes indicated a partial substitution of sodium cholate for the phospholipids removed. The ice nucleation activity of delipidated outer membranes was restored by reconstitution with various phospholipids in a cholate dialysis procedure. Lipid classes differed in their ability to restore ice nucleation activity to sodium cholate-treated outer membranes. These results suggest that a hydrophobic environment provided either by lipids or certain detergent micelles is required for proper assembly and structural organization of an oligomeric ice protein complex enabling its expression as an ice nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2020670618,"Research into embryonic cell grafting in human subjects suffering from Parkinson's disease should not repeat the mistakes made by adrenal autograft investigators, who operated on far more humans than on nonhuman primates because of a single unconfirmed report of dramatic improvement in two Mexican patients. Citing extensive data from experimental transplants conducted as early as 1944, the authors argue that, until a sufficient number of animal studies have been performed to answer many crucial questions about human fetal tissue transplants, researchers should refrain from experimenting on human patients."
https://openalex.org/W1580759730,"Abstract A novel inhibitor-stop method for the determination of initial rates of purine nucleobase transport in human erythrocytes has been developed, based on the addition of seven assay volumes of cold 19 mM papaverine to terminate influx. In view of our finding that the initial velocities of adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine influx into human erythrocytes were linear for only 4-6 s at 37 degrees C, the present method has been used to reexamine the kinetics of purine nucleobase transport in these cells. Initial influx rates of all three purine nucleobases were shown to be the result of concurrent facilitated and nonfacilitated diffusion. The nonfacilitated influx rates could be estimated either from the linear concentration dependence of nucleobase influx at high concentrations of permeant or from residual influx rates which were not inhibited by the presence of co-permeants. Appropriate corrections for nonfacilitated diffusion were made to the influx rates observed at low nucleobase concentrations. Kinetic analyses indicated that adenine (Km = 13 +/- 1 microM, n = 7), guanine (Km = 37 +/- 2 microM, n = 5), and hypoxanthine (Km = 180 +/- 12 microM, n = 6) were mutually competitive substrates for transport. The Ki values obtained with each nucleobase as an inhibitor of the influx of the other nucleobases were similar to their respective Km values for influx. Furthermore, the transport of the purine nucleobases was not inhibited by nucleosides (uridine, inosine) or by inhibitors of nucleoside transport (6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine, dilazep, dipyridamole). It is concluded that all three purine nucleobases share a common facilitated transport system in human erythrocytes which is functionally distinct from the nucleoside transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1507489360,"The atrial gland of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica is an exocrine organ that expresses at least three genes belonging to the egg-laying hormone (ELH) family. In order to study the post-translational processing of the ELH-related gene products in the atrial gland and how it compares to the bag cells, peptides were isolated from the atrial gland and chemically characterized. The A- and B-related precursors were each cleaved in vivo to yield several major and minor peptides including peptides A and B and the ELH-related peptide complexes that caused egg laying. About 13% of the peptide complexes were further enzymically processed by the atrial gland to yield smaller fragments, which included A-AP.A-ELH-(15-36), A-AP.[Ala27]A-ELH-(15-36), and A-AP.[Gln23,Ala27]A-ELH-(16-36), where A-AP is an acidic peptide encoded by the A- and B-related genes and A-ELH is an ELH-related peptide encoded by the A gene. These processed peptide fragments were not active in an egg-laying bioassay, indicating that retention of the 14-residue NH2-terminal segment of the A-ELH-related sequence, or some portion thereof, was critical for the induction of egg laying. Other characterized peptides included two novel 13-residue NH2-terminal peptides, A-NTP and B-NTP, representing residues 22-34 of the A and B precursors, respectively. These two peptides occurred adjacent to the signal peptide region in each precursor, and their characterization established the site of signal peptide cleavage to be the Ser21-Gln22 peptide bond of each precursor. Intermediate peptide fragments (A-NTP-peptide A and B-NTP-peptide B) were also identified indicating that there was a specific ordering in the cleavage of peptide bonds during posttranslational processing. Finally, a new 55-residue atrial gland peptide was also isolated that was not a part of any ELH-related precursor characterized to date."
https://openalex.org/W1568989132,"Abstract The mechanism of transport of the antiviral agent acyclovir (ACV) into human erythrocytes has been investigated. Initial velocities of ACV influx were determined with an inhibitor-stop assay that used papaverine to inhibit ACV influx rapidly and completely. ACV influx was nonconcentrative and appeared to be rate-saturable with a Km of 260 +/- 20 microM (n = 8). However, two lines of evidence indicate that ACV permeates the erythrocyte membrane by means other than the nucleoside transport system: 1) potent inhibitors (1.0 microM) of nucleoside transport (dipyridamole, 6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine, and dilazep) had little (less than 8% inhibition) or no effect upon the influx of 5.0 microM ACV; and 2) a 100-fold molar excess of several purine and pyrimidine nucleosides had no inhibitory effect upon the influx of 1.0 microM ACV. However, ACV transport was inhibited competitively by adenine (Ki = 9.5 microM), guanine (Ki = 25 microM), and hypoxanthine (Ki = 180 microM). Conversely, ACV was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 240-280 microM) of the transport of adenine (Km = 13 microM), guanine (Km = 37 microM), and hypoxanthine (Km = 180 microM). Desciclovir and ganciclovir, two compounds related structurally to ACV, were also found to be competitive inhibitors of acyclovir influx (Ki = 1.7 and 1.5 mM, respectively). These results indicate that ACV enters human erythrocytes chiefly via the same nucleobase carrier that transports adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine."
https://openalex.org/W1585211817,"Experiments were conducted, using a nonspecific lipid transfer protein, to vary the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio of rat proximal small intestinal microvillus membranes in order to assess the possible role of cholesterol in modulating enzymatic activities of this plasma membrane. Cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratios from 0.71 to 1.30 were produced from a normal value of 1.05 by incubation with the transfer protein and an excess of either phosphatidylcholine or cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine liposomes for 60 min at 37 degrees C. Cholesterol loading or depletion of the membranes was accompanied by a decrease or increase, respectively, in their lipid fluidity, as assessed by steady-state fluorescence polarization techniques using the lipid-soluble fluorophore 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Increasing the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio also decreased alkaline phosphatase specific activity by approximately 20-30%, whereas decreasing this ratio increased this enzymatic activity by 20-30%. Sucrase, maltase, and lactase specific activities were not affected in these same preparations. Since the changes in alkaline phosphatase activity could be secondary to alterations in fluidity, cholesterol, or both, additional experiments were performed using benzyl alcohol, a known fluidizer. Benzyl alcohol (25 mM) restored the fluidity of cholesterol-enriched preparations to control levels, did not change the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio, and failed to alter alkaline phosphatase activity. These findings, therefore, indicate that alterations in the cholesterol content and cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio of microvillus membranes can modulate alkaline phosphatase but not sucrase, maltase, or lactase activities. Moreover, membrane fluidity does not appear to be an important physiological regulator of these enzymatic activities."
https://openalex.org/W1554127324,"Peptides recognized by rabbit antibodies to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were extracted from diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and resolved by filtration on Sephadex G-25 in 50 mM acetic acid. The immunoreactive VIPs of RBL cells eluted from Sephadex G-25 at 35-41%, 53-60%, and 69-73% bed volume, but not at 63-68% as for the neuropeptide VIP1-28. The two forms of immunoreactive VIP larger than VIP1-28 reacted with antibodies to both VIP1-9 and VIP10-28, but the smallest was bound only by antibodies to VIP10-28. The smallest immunoreactive VIP was purified by ion-exchange and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and the amino acid sequence was determined to be that of VIP10-28 with asparagine-free acid at the carboxyl terminus rather than the amide of VIP neuropeptide. Challenge of RBL cells with 1 microM ionophore A23187 at 37 degrees C released VIP10-28 rapidly to a mean of 75% at 5 min and 77% at 30 min. The VIP generated and released by mast cells thus consists of a mixture of peptides that all differ structurally from the neuropeptide VIP."
https://openalex.org/W1497778408,"Abstract A cDNA clone encoding the entire decarboxylase (E1)alpha precursor of the bovine branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex has been isolated from a lambda ZAP library prepared from bovine liver poly(A)+ RNA. Nucleotide sequencing indicates that this E1 alpha cDNA clone is 1821 base pairs (bp) in length with an open reading frame of 1365 bp and a 3'-untranslated region of 356 bp. A polyadenylation signal of the type AATAAA is located 27 bp upstream of the start of a poly(A)+ tail. There is a pair of identical 32-bp direct repeats of unknown function at the 5'-end of the cDNA. The bovine E1 alpha cDNA encodes a leader peptide of 55 residues including three candidate initiation methionines, and a mature E1 alpha of 400 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 45,385. The deduced primary structure shows the published peptide sequences flanking the two phosphorylation sites and the amino-terminal sequence (residues 1-32) of bovine E1 alpha determined in this study. The phosphoserine-bearing regions appear to be homologous between bovine E1 alpha and human pyruvate decarboxylase-alpha subunits, with respect to both amino acid identity and the position in each polypeptide chain. Northern blot analysis using the bovine E1 alpha cDNA as probe shows the presence of a single species of E1 alpha mRNA (2 kilobase pairs) in bovine liver, human placenta, and skin fibroblasts. Moreover, the E1 alpha mRNA exists in normal size and quantity in cultured fibroblasts derived from a maple-syrup-urine-disease homozygote deficient in E1 activity. The results preclude a defect in the transcription and processing of E1 alpha mRNA in these maple-syrup-urine-disease cells. Studies with 3T3-L1 cells show that a single species of E1 alpha mRNA (2 kilobase pairs) is expressed in the cells and that contents of the murine E1 alpha mRNA and subunit are markedly elevated during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. The results indicate that the induction of murine E1 activity during adipocyte differentiation occurs at the pretranslational level."
https://openalex.org/W1679010676,"Methodology is reported for extracting thyroid hormone receptors from rat liver nuclei and for purifying these such that certain receptor properties can be examined. The extraction technique resulted in 1700 pmol of receptor/2 kg of liver and bypasses centrifugation in dense sucrose. The receptor was then purified by sequential heparin-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, and phospho-Ultrogel chromatography and size exclusion and hydrophobic interaction high performance liquid chromatography. These steps yielded 23-35 micrograms of receptor at 0.7-1.5% purity from two 2-kg liver preparations. The cross-linkers disuccinimidyl suberate and N-succinimidyl-6-(4-azido-2-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate were employed to covalently attach 125I-labeled 3,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) to the purified receptor. Autoradiography after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed major 49,000 Mr and minor 58,000 Mr specific T3-binding proteins. The purified receptors exhibited high affinity (Kd = 100 pM) single site T3-binding activity. Because of the high affinity and specificity of [125I]T3 for the receptor, it was possible to uniquely identify the receptor containing DNA-protein complexes in a gel retardation assay and thus directly demonstrate for the first time that the receptor can specifically recognize sequences in the 5′-flanking DNA of the rat growth hormone gene. [125I]T3-labeled receptor migrated at the same position as the major gel-retarded 32P-labeled DNA band. Specific DNA competed for the binding much more strongly than nonspecific DNA. Thus, the purification procedure results in relatively large quantities of receptor at a purity sufficient for detecting and studying a number of its properties including specific DNA binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1557428740,"The results of our previous studies suggested that differences in the primary structures of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) A and B proteins (EC 2.4.2.8) of mice are associated with altered turnover of these proteins in reticulocytes. On the basis of nucleotide sequence comparisons of their corresponding cDNAs, we show here that the HPRT A and B proteins differ at two positions; there is an alanine/proline substitution at amino acid position 2 and a valine/alanine substitution at amino acid position 29 (HPRT A/B proteins, respectively; total protein length, 218 amino acids). On the basis of results obtained from sequencing of the N termini of the purified HPRT A and B proteins, we also show that these amino acid substitutions are associated with differences in processing of the proteins; HPRT B, which is encoded as N-terminal Met-Pro, has a free N-terminal proline residue; HPRT A, which is encoded as N-terminal Met-Ala, lacks a free N-terminal alpha-amino group and is presumed to be acetylated following removal of the N-terminal methionine (i.e. AcO-Ala). These observations are discussed in reference to the idea that the N terminus of a protein plays a role in determining the rate at which the protein is degraded in erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1530232164,"Human adipocytes are of limited viability (7 +/- 2% release of lactate dehydrogenase/h) and contain active ectophosphatases which are capable of sequentially degrading ATP to adenosine. At densities of 30,000-40,000 cells/ml, human fat cell suspensions accumulated adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine, and their concentrations were 38 +/- 8, 120 +/- 10, and 31 +/- 7 nmol/liter after 3 h of incubation. Dipyridamole (10 mumol/liter), an inhibitor of nucleoside transport, caused a 5-7-fold increase in adenosine accumulation which was reduced by 85% on inhibition of ectophosphatases by beta-glycerophosphate and antibodies against ecto-5'-nucleotidase or alpha, beta-methylene 5'-adenosine diphosphate (10 mumol/liter), respectively, indicating that most of the adenosine is produced in the extracellular compartment. Accordingly, the spontaneous accumulation of adenosine was reduced beyond 5 nmol/liter on inhibition of ectophosphatase activities or removal of extracellular AMP by AMP deaminase (4 units/ml). Added adenosine (30 nmol/liter) disappeared until its concentration approached 5 nmol/liter. Isoproterenol (1 mumol/liter) had no effect on adenosine accumulation regardless whether purine production from extracellular sources was minimized or not. In contrast to adenosine, the concentrations of inosine and hypoxanthine displayed only a modest decrease (30-50%) on inhibition of ectophosphatase activities. In addition, isoproterenol caused a 2-3-fold increase in inosine and hypoxanthine production which was concentration-dependent and could be inhibited by propranolol. It is concluded that the adenosine that accumulates in human adipocyte suspensions is almost exclusively derived from adenine nucleotides which are released by leaking cells. By contrast, inosine and hypoxanthine are produced inside the cells, and the release of these latter purines appears to be linked to ATP turnover via adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1571531402,"The phenolic group of active site residue Tyr-248 in carboxypeptidase A has a pKa value of 10.06, as determined from the pH dependence of its rate of nitration by tetranitromethane. The decrease in enzyme activity (kcat/Km) in alkaline solution, characterized by a pKa value of approximately 9.0 (for cobalt carboxypeptidase A), is associated with the protonation state of an imidazole ligand of the active-site metal ion, as indicated by a selective pH dependence of the 1H NMR spectrum of the enzyme. Inhibition of the cobalt-substituted enzyme by 2-(1-carboxy-2-phenylethyl)phenol and its 4,6-dichloro- and 4-phenylazo-derivatives confirms that the decrease in enzyme activity (kcat/Km) in acidic solution, characterized by a pKa value of 5.8, is due to the protonation state of a water molecule bound to the active-site metal ion in the absence of substrate. Changes in the coordination number of the active-site metal ion are seen in its visible absorption spectrum as a consequence of binding of the phenolic inhibitors. Conventional concepts regarding the mechanisms of the enzyme are brought into question."
https://openalex.org/W1518736393,"Spectrophotometric titration of ferric octaethylporphyrin (OEP) with apomyoglobin revealed their 1:1 complex formation. Proton NMR spectrum of the OEP-reconstituted deoxymyoglobin exhibits an exchangeable peak from the proximal F8 histidine at 78.5 ppm, indicating the incorporation of iron OEP into the heme cavity to form the Fe-N(His-F8) bond. OEP metmyoglobin without external ligand has an iron-bound water that deprotonates above pH 7.8. Affinities of the aquometmyoglobin for several ionic ligands were comparable with those of native metmyoglobin. Deoxy OEP myoglobin at 25 degrees C reversibly binds oxygen with an affinity of P50 = 0.8 mm Hg, which is similar to that of native protein. These results indicate that iron OEP serves as a prosthetic group for myoglobin with normal function, despite the significant structural and electronic difference between OEP and protoporphyrin. The unexpected functional similarity between native and OEP myoglobins was interpreted in terms of a structural perturbation at the heme distal site caused by introduction of bulky OEP into the heme pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1567080833,"To study the structural requirements in heparin for interaction with heparin cofactor II (HC II) we have analyzed the properties of oligosaccharide fractions obtained after digestion of heparin by heparinase and gel filtration. No activation of HC II was detected in the presence of di-, tetra-, hexa-, octa-, deca-, or do-decasaccharides. The hexasaccharide pool was fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography, and the structure of the major species, obtained in a homogeneous state, was investigated by NMR. All the resonances were unambiguously assigned using correlation by homonuclear and heteronuclear scalar coupling. The six monosaccharide residues of this hexasaccharide were thus easily identified. The sequence was established through two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect experiments. The results indicate that this product is a hexasaccharide recently described by Linhardt et al. (Linhardt, R. J., Rice, K. G., Merchant, Z. M., Kim, Y. S., and Lohse, D. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14448-14454). However, we could not confirm the anticoagulant activity observed by these authors. Moreover, none of the individual components obtained after fractionation of the hexasaccharide pool was able either to activate HC II against thrombin or to inhibit HC II activation by heparin. Thus, our data led us to conclude that no unique sequence is involved in heparin for binding to HC II and inactivation of thrombin. The interaction merely results from the highly anionic character of heparin."
https://openalex.org/W2127278397,"In the preceding paper (Roux, L., Holojda, S., Sundblad, G., Freeze, H. H., and Varki, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8879-8889) we described the metabolic labeling and isolation of sulfated N-linked oligosaccharides from mammalian cell lines. All cell lines studied contained a class of sulfated sialylated complex-type chains with 2-6 negative charges. In this paper, we show that bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial (CPAE) and human erythroleukemia (K562) cell lines also contain a class of more highly charged sulfated but less sialylated oligosaccharides. These molecules were further characterized by ion exchange chromatography and various enzymatic and chemical treatments. In both cell lines they contained greater than 6 negative charges, but those from K562 were even more highly charged than those from CPAE. Nitrous acid, heparinase, and heparitinase degradation of K562 oligosaccharides released 88, 64, and 78%, respectively, of 35S label. Combined digestion with the two enzymes resulted in 87% release. The corresponding values for CPAE were 48, 25, and 50% (60% for the two enzymes together). Chondroitinase ABC (or AC) digestion of K562 and CPAE oligosaccharides released 10 and 5%, respectively. About 30% of the 35S-labeled oligosaccharides from CPAE were sensitive to endo-beta-galactosidase, indicating that poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine structures were present on some chains. Highly charged [3H]mannose-labeled sulfated oligosaccharides from CPAE cells became neutral after treatment with heparinase/heparitinase but were resistant to Pronase, further proving that glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-like chains were directly attached to N-linked oligosaccharides. Such neutralized oligosaccharides did not bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose, but some interacted with phytohemagglutinin L4, indicating that they were bi-, tri-, or tetra-antennary complex-type chains. Thus, K562 and CPAE cells contain different types of GAG chains directly attached to asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Such molecules were not found in many other cell lines that synthesize the more typical O-linked GAG chains. This suggests that the occurrence of these novel N-linked chains is not a random event resulting from accidental initiation of GAG chain synthesis on N-linked intermediates in the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1993362730,"A two-locus genetic model is studied in which one locus controls the tendency of individuals to act altruistically toward siblings and the other locus controls the mating habits of females. It is demonstrated that genetic variation at the altruism locus is often sufficient to induce an increase in the frequency of genes that cause females to produce all of their offspring with a single mate. This occurs because of nonrandom associations that develop between genes that cause altruism and those that affect female mating behavior. The results provide a new explanation for the evolution of monogamy, and they suggest a previously unexplored mechanism for the evolution of a variety of other behavioral traits as well."
https://openalex.org/W1530513890,"Flow microcalorimetric titrations of calmodulin with seminalplasmin at 25 degrees C revealed that the high affinity one-to-one complex in the presence of Ca2+ (Comte, M., Malnoe, A., and Cox, J. A. (1986) Biochem. J. 240, 567-573) is entirely enthalpy-driven (delta H0 = -50 kJ.mol-1; delta S0 = O J.K-1.mol-1; delta Cp0 = O J.K-1.mol-1) and is not influenced by the proton or Mg2+ concentration. The Sr2+- and Cd2+-promoted high affinity complexes are also exothermic for -49 and -45 kJ.mol-1, respectively. The observed low affinity interaction in the absence of divalent ions displays no enthalpy change. No enthalpy changes are observed when calmodulin and seminalplasmin are mixed in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, Zn2+, or Mn2+. Enthalpy titrations of the 1:1 calmodulin-seminalplasmin complex with Ca2+ and of partly Ca2+-saturated calmodulin with seminalplasmin revealed that only the species calmodulin.Can greater than or equal to 2 is fully competent for high affinity interaction with seminalplasmin. Binding of the second Ca2+ is strongly enhanced (K2 greater than or equal to 5 X 10(7) M-1) as compared to that in free calmodulin (K2 = 2.6 X 10(5) M-1). This is essentially due to the concomitant strongly exothermic step of isomerization of the calmodulin-seminalplasmin complex from its low to its high affinity form. Binding of the remaining two Ca2+ to the high affinity seminalplasmin-calmodulin complex displays the same affinity constants and endothermic enthalpy change as in free calmodulin. A microcalorimetric study on the complex formation between Ca2+-saturated calmodulin and turkey gizzard myosin light chain kinase revealed that the interaction is strongly exothermic with an important overall gain of order (delta H0 = -85 kJ.mol-1; delta S0 = -122 J.K-1.mol-1) and occurs with significant proton uptake (0.44 H+ per mol at pH 7.5). The observed low affinity interaction (K = 2.2 X 10(5) M-1) in the absence of Ca2+ (Mamar-Bachi, A., and Cox, J. A.

https://openalex.org/W2012059904,"The degradation of slowly turning over 125I-lactoperoxidase-labeled plasma membrane polypeptides in response to reversible temperature and lysosomotropic inhibitors was studied in rat hepatoma cultures. Cells were radiolabeled and left for 24 h to allow the removal of rapidly degraded proteins. Remaining trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein was degraded (t 1/2 = 40-68 h) by an apparent first order process 60-86% sensitive to 10 mM NH4Cl or 5 mM methylamine and greater than 95% inhibited by temperature reduction to 18 degrees C. Thus, membrane proteins are selected for degradation in a time-dependent manner by a system which is sensitive to both 18 degrees C and to lysosomotropic amines. When inhibitory conditions were removed after 40-48 h, degradation of 125I-labeled protein resumed at the same rate as that seen in their absence. Since membrane proteins do not exhibit accelerated degradation after removal of inhibitory conditions, there can be no marking or sorting of those proteins destined for degradation during the 40-h exposure to inhibitory conditions. Exposure to amines or 18 degrees C did not affect the position of two-dimensionally resolved labeled polypeptides. Fractionation of labeled cells on Percoll gradients after 40 h of exposure to low temperature or amines showed that labeled protein remained in the plasma membrane fractions of the gradient although shifted to a slightly lower buoyant density in the presence of amines. These results support the notion that selection of plasma membrane proteins for degradation requires their internalization into acidic vesicles. Lysosomotropic amines and reduced temperature interfere with the selection process by preventing membrane fusion events."
https://openalex.org/W2169363379,"In the preceding two papers, we described two new classes of sulfated N-linked oligosaccharides isolated from total cellular 35SO4-labeled macromolecules of different mammalian cell lines. The first class carries various combinations of sialic acids and 6-O-sulfate esters on typical complex-type chains, while the second carries heparin and heparan-like sequences. In this study, we have characterized a sulfophosphoglycoprotein of 140 kDa from FG-Met-2 pancreatic cancer cells whose oligosaccharides share some properties of both these classes. The molecule was localized to the cell surface by electron microscopy using a monoclonal antibody (S3-53) and by cell surface 125I-labeling. Metabolic labeling of the cells with radioactive glucosamine, methionine, inorganic sulfate, or phosphate all demonstrated a single 140-kDa molecule. Pulse-chase analysis and tunicamycin treatment indicated the glycosylation of a putative primary translation product of 110 kDa via an intermediate (120 kDa) to the mature form (140 kDa). Digestion with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) indicated a minimum of four N-linked glycosylation sites. PNGaseF released more than 90% of the [6-3H]GlcNH2 label and 40-70% of 35SO4 label from the immunoprecipitated 140-kDa molecule. The isolated oligosaccharides were characterized as described in the preceding two papers. The majority of [6-3H]GlcNH2-labeled molecules were susceptible to neuraminidase. More than 50% of the 35SO4 label was associated with only 5-10% of the 3H-labeled chains. Some of the sulfated chains were partly sialylated molecules with four to five negative charges. Treatment with nitrous acid released about 25% of the 35SO4 label as free sulfate, together with 6% of the [6-3H]GlcNH2 label, indicating the presence of N-sulfated glucosamine residues. Some of these oligosaccharides were degraded by heparinase and heparitinase. Therefore, while they are not as highly charged as typical heparin or heparan chains, they must share structural features that permit recognition by the enzymes. Thus, this 140-kDa glycoprotein contains at least four asparagine-linked chains substituted with a heterogeneous mixture of sulfated sequences. The heterogeneity of these molecules is as extensive as that described for whole-cell sulfated N-linked oligosaccharides in the preceding two papers."

This cDNA includes 141 bp of 5' untranslated sequence and encodes a signal peptide plus a portion of the amino-terminal cross-linking (7 S) domain. This cDNA clone was used to obtain the 5' portion of the murine alpha 1(IV) gene from which the nucleotide sequence of exons 1-6 was determined. Exon 1 (234 bp) codes for the 5' untranslated sequence, and the first 28 residues of the protein. The 5' untranslated sequence is highly conserved between the mouse and human species and has the potential to form three mutually exclusive stem-loop structures which may play a role in post-transcriptional regulation. Exons 2-6, which code for the 7 S domain, were found to be 60, 90, 45, and 63 bp in size. The exon structure for the helical portion of the 7 S domain is different from that of the major helical domain, suggesting that they evolved differently."
https://openalex.org/W1550008281,"The role of platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) in initiating glycogen breakdown in the fetal rabbit lung was assessed by intraperitoneal administration of this potent ether-linked glycerophospholipid. Forty-five min after in utero injection of PAF (2.5 X 10(-7) mol), fetal pulmonary and hepatic glycogen concentrations were reduced from 326 to 256 and from 9.8 to 6.6 micrograms of glycogen/mg protein, respectively. Glycolytic activity was similarly increased as judged by an elevation of lactate (2-fold) in lung, liver, and plasma upon PAF injection. These actions of PAF were dose- and time-dependent. The glycogenolytic response did not occur when an equimolar dose of the inactive enantiomer, D-PAF was injected. Pretreatment of the fetus with a specific PAF receptor antagonist, SRI-63-441, prevented the PAF response. We have previously demonstrated (Hoffman, D. R., Truong, C. T., and Johnston, J. M. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 879, 88-96) that PAF biosynthesis and PAF concentrations increase significantly on day 24 of fetal rabbit lung development. A concurrent decrease in pulmonary glycogen concentration at this point of gestation is potentially reflective of the PAF-induced action. Thus, these observations would suggest a role for PAF in the normal physiology of fetal lung maturation."
https://openalex.org/W157641886,"Size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography was used to compare the Stokes radius of the mixed disulfide of trypsinogen refolded for 10 min with the Stokes radius of denatured trypsinogen in high concentrations of urea. After folding for 10 min, rechromatography of a collection of sequential fractions of an initial separation showed that the fractions display microheterogeneity as seen in the value of the Stokes radius of each fraction. These intermediate species differed in their Stokes radius, and each had a globular structure cross-linked by disulfide bonds. In contrast, when trypsinogen with the native disulfides intact was equilibrated at different concentrations of urea (0-8 M), a progressive increase in Stokes radius was observed with extent of unfolding. Rechromatography of a series of fractions collected at a specific urea concentration showed that each had the same Stokes radius as the fraction in the initial separation. Urea-denatured trypsinogen and partially refolded trypsinogen must therefore differ in the disulfide pairing that links regions of the polypeptide chain. These observations support the suggestion that non-native disulfide bonds are responsible for the many stable conformations that form early in the folding of the mixed disulfide of trypsinogen (Light, A., and Higaki, J.N. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 5556-5564). These intermediates initially are loose structures (large Stokes radius) that become more compact with time (decreasing Stokes radius). The intermediates must therefore undergo a continuing disulfide interchange until native disulfides form late in the process when the stable conformation of the native molecule is reached."

Diffraction quality crystals of cholera toxin B-subunit have been obtained at room temperature by vapor diffusion with polyethylene glycol in the presence of the nonionic detergent beta-octyl glucoside. The crystals have been characterized with x-radiation as monoclinic, space group P21, with unit cell dimensions a = 39.0 A, b = 94.3 A, c = 67.5 A, beta = 96.0 degrees. There are two molecules per unit cell, with one molecule (Mr = 58,000) in each asymmetric unit. Precession photographs (micron = 13 degrees) show that crystals diffract beyond 3.3-A resolution and are stable in the x-ray beam at room temperature for at least 40 h; thus, they can be used to collect three-dimensional crystallographic data."
