https://openalex.org/W3207949896,"Objectives This study aims to investigate the potential factors associated with mental health outcomes among Chinese adults during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Methods This is an online cross-sectional survey conducted among Chinese adults in February 2020. Outcome measurements included the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3), two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), two-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-2), and two items from the Clinician-Administered Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale. COVID-19 related factors, physical health, lifestyle, and self-efficacy were also measured. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were performed. Results This study included 1456 participants (age: 33.8±10.5 years; female: 59.1%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, loneliness, and PTSD symptoms were 11.3%, 7.6%, 38.7%, and 33.9%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, loneliness was associated with being single, separated/divorced/widowed, low level of education, current location, medication, more somatic symptoms, lower self-efficacy, and going out frequently. Depression was associated with fear of infection, binge drinking, more somatic symptoms, lower self-efficacy, and longer screen time. Anxiety was associated with more somatic symptoms and lower self-efficacy. PTSD symptoms were associated with more somatic symptoms, lower self-efficacy, higher perceived risk of infection, fear of infection, and self-rated more negative influence due to the epidemic ( p &lt;0.05). Conclusions Mental health problems during the COVID-19 epidemic were associated with various biopsychosocial and COVID-19 related factors. Psychological interventions should be aware of these influencing factors and prioritize support for those people at higher risk."
https://openalex.org/W3207704004,"Insectivorous bats provide ecosystem services in agricultural and urban landscapes by consuming arthropods that are considered pests. Bat species inhabiting cities are expected to consume insects associated with urban areas, such as mosquitoes, flying termites, moths, and beetles. We captured insectivorous bats in the Federal District of Brazil and used fecal DNA metabarcoding to investigate the arthropod consumed by five bat species living in colonies in city buildings, and ascertained whether their predation was related to ecosystem services. These insectivorous bat species were found to consume 83 morphospecies of arthropods and among these 41 were identified to species, most of which were agricultural pests. We propose that bats may roost in the city areas and forage in the nearby agricultural fields using their ability to fly over long distances. We also calculated the value of the pest suppression ecosystem service by the bats. By a conservative estimation, bats save US$ 94 per hectare of cornfields, accounting for an annual savings of US$ 390.6 million per harvest in Brazil. Our study confirms that, regardless of their roosting location, bats are essential for providing ecosystem services in the cities, with extensive impacts on crops and elsewhere, in addition to significant savings in the use of pesticides."

Folic acid (FA) can reduce the risk of pregnancies affected by NTDs.We aimed to investigate whether mandatory folic acid (FA) fortification of flours is cost-effective as compared to non-mandatory fortification, and to verify whether FA dosage, cost composition, and the quality of economic studies influence the cost-effectiveness of outcomes.We conducted a systematic review. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD 42018115682). A search was conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and EBSCO/CINAHL between January 2019 and October 2020 and updated in February 2021. Eligible studies comprised original economic analyses of mandatory FA fortification of wheat and corn flours (maize flours) compared to strategies of non-mandatory fortification in flours and/or use of FA supplements for NTD prevention. The Drummond verification list was used for quality analysis.A total of 7,859 studies were identified, of which 13 were selected. Most (77%; n = 10) studies originated from high-income countries, while three (23%) were from upper-middle-income countries. Results of a cost-effectiveness analysis showed that fortification is cost-effective for NTD prevention, except for in one study in New Zealand. The cost-benefit analysis yielded a median ratio of 17.5:1 (0.98:1 to 417.1:1), meaning that for each monetary unit spent in the program, there would be a return of 17.5 monetary units. Even in the most unfavorable case of mandatory fortification, the investment in the program would virtually payoff at a ratio of 1:0.98. All FA dosages were cost-effective and offered positive health gains, except in one study. The outcomes of two studies showed that FA dosages above 300 μg/100 g have a higher CBA ratio. The studies with the inclusion of ""loss of consumer choice"" in the analysis may alter the fortification cost-efficacy ratio.We expect the findings to be useful for public agencies in different countries in decision-making on the implementation and/or continuity of FA fortification as a public policy in NTD prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3205368508,"Habitat loss from anthropogenic development has led to an unprecedented decline in global biodiversity. Protected areas (PAs) exist to counteract this degradation of ecosystems. In the European Union, the Natura 2000 (N2k) network is the basis for continent-wide conservation efforts. N2k is the world's largest coordinated network of protected areas. However, threats to ecosystems do not stop at the borders of PAs. As measured by a landscape fragmentation metric, anthropogenic development can affect the interiors of PAs. To ensure the long-term viability of the N2k network of PAs, this paper attempts to quantify the degree to which N2k sites are insulated from development pressures. We use a comprehensive dataset of effective mesh density (seff) to measure aggregate fragmentation inside and within a 5 km buffer surrounding N2k sites. Our results show a strong correlation (R² = 0.78) between fragmentation (seff) within and around N2k sites. This result applies to all biogeographical regions in Europe. Only a narrow majority (58.5%) of N2k sites are less fragmented than their surroundings. Remote and mountainous regions in northern Europe, the Alps, parts of Spain, and parts of eastern Europe show the lowest levels of fragmentation. These regions tend to hold the largest N2k sites as measured by area. In contrast, central and western Europe show the highest fragmentation levels within and around N2k sites. 24.5% of all N2k sites are classified as highly to very-highly fragmented. N2k PA age since initial protection does not correlate with the difference in exterior and interior fragmentation of N2k PAs. These results indicate that PAs in Europe are not sheltered from anthropogenic pressures leading to fragmentation. Hence, we argue that there is a high potential for improving PA efficacy by taking pre-emptive action against encroaching anthropogenic fragmentation and by targeting scarce financial resources where fragmentation pressures can be mitigated through enforced construction bans inside PAs."
https://openalex.org/W3206697098,"Introduction This study was performed to determine the clinical outcomes of patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 discharged from the emergency department. Methods The present descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was performed on 400 patients discharged with a diagnosis of COVID-19 from the emergency departments of hospitals affiliated to Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in the time period of 21 March-21 June, 2020. The disease characteristics and demographic data were collected by phone calls during the first, third, and fourth weeks using a researcher-made questionnaire. Finally, the data were analyzed by univariate logistic regression and cross-tabulation using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20. Results In the first week of follow-up, 23(5.8%) patients died, of whom seven patients were female and 16 were male (mean age of death: 70.73±3.27). Out of 41 (10.3%) patients with underlying diseases, 7 (17.1%) died; but out of 359 (89.8%) cases with no history of disease only 16 (4.5%) died. The risk of death in subjects with a history of underlying diseases was 3.27 times higher than those without a history of disease (P = 0.02) (OR = 3.27, 95% CI, 1.20–8.87); and this risk was 1.41 times higher in patients with more family members ( P = 0.04) (OR = 1.41, 95% CI, 1.01–1.97). Furthermore, 81 (20.3%) patients had spread the virus to others in their households and disregarded hygiene guidelines such as washing hands, keeping social distancing, and wearing face masks after discharge. In addition, family members of these patients were 16.37 times more likely to be infected than patients who followed the protocols ( P ≤ 0.001) (OR = 16.37, 95% CI, 9.10–29.45). Conclusion Since our findings showed that mortality rate is high in the first week after patients’ referral to the emergency departments, the health status of infected people should be carefully monitored daily in this period."
https://openalex.org/W3206263853,"Socioeconomic crisis and humanitarian disasters can cause increased stress for women who experience inter-partner violence (IPV). This study analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on this important issue, their related health and social services and working conditions from the perspectives of professionals in different sectors. Forty-three semi-structured interviews were carried out with 47 professionals (44 women and 3 men) from 40 different entities (September 2020-April 2021). This content analysis suggests that the pandemic and its associated prevention measures have had a negative impact on women exposed to IPV and their children, which affected their social wellbeing. Professionals described burnout, difficult and slow administrative processes, and problems with coordination and access to information. These negative impacts were mitigated, in part, by the work of professionals, but this suggests that a series of key strategies are needed to improve the response capacity of the service sector to IPV in situations of crisis. These improvements are related to the availability of human and material resources; an efficient coordination network between the professionals from different sectors; existence of informal support networks in the community; protocols/procedures and prior training for better implementation; and greater flexibility and accessibility of basic services that benefit women who experience IPV."
https://openalex.org/W3204974197,"With the rapid development of economy and the acceleration of urbanization, the garbage produced by urban residents also increases with the increase of population. In many big cities, the phenomenon of ""garbage siege"" has seriously affected the development of cities and the lives of residents. Sanitary landfill is an important way of municipal solid waste disposal. However, due to the restriction of social, environmental and economic conditions, landfill site selection has become a very challenging task. In addition, landfill site selection is full of uncertainty and complexity due to the lack of cognitive ability of decision-makers and the existence of uncertain information in the decision-making process. Therefore, a novel multi-attribute decision making method based on q-rung orthopair probabilistic hesitant fuzzy power weight Muirhead mean operator is proposed in this paper, which can solve the problem of landfill site selection well. This method uses probability to represent the hesitance of decision maker and retains decision information more comprehensively. The negative effect of abnormal data on the decision result is eliminated by using the power average operator. Muirhead mean operator is used to describe the correlation between attributes. Then, an example of landfill site selection is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the advantages of the proposed method are illustrated by parameter analysis and comparative analysis. The results show that this method has a wider space for information expression, gives the decision maker a great degree of freedom in decision-making, and has robustness."
https://openalex.org/W3207736850,"Climate change is likely to worsen the food security situation through its impact on food production, which may indirectly affect fertility behaviour. This study examines the direct and indirect effects of climate change (e.g., temperature and precipitation) via the production of major crops, as well as their short- and long-term effects on the total fertility rate (TFR) in Bangladesh. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to perform path analysis and distinguish the direct influence of climate change on fertility and its indirect influence on fertility through food security. We also applied the error correction model (ECM) to analyze the time-series data on temperature and precipitation, crop production and fertility rate of Bangladesh from 1966 to 2015. The results show that maximum temperature has a direct effect and indirect negative effect-via crop production-on TFR, while crop production has a direct positive effect and indirect negative effect-via infant mortality-on TFR. In the short term, TFR responds negatively to the maximum temperature but positively in the long term. The effect of rainfall on TFR is found to be direct, positive, but mainly short-term. Although indicators of economic development play an important part in the fertility decline in Bangladesh, some climate change parameters and crop production are non-negligible factors."
https://openalex.org/W3205547713,"Spatial trends represent an obstacle to genetic evaluation in maize breeding. Spatial analyses can correct spatial trends, which allow for an increase in selective accuracy. The objective of this study was to compare the spatial (SPA) and non-spatial (NSPA) models in diallel multi-environment trial analyses in maize breeding. The trials consisted of 78 inter-populational maize hybrids, tested in four environments (E1, E2, E3, and E4), with three replications, under a randomized complete block design. The SPA models accounted for autocorrelation among rows and columns by the inclusion of first-order autoregressive matrices (AR1 ⊗ AR1). Then, the rows and columns factors were included in the fixed and random parts of the model. Based on the Bayesian information criteria, the SPA models were used to analyze trials E3 and E4, while the NSPA model was used for analyzing trials E1 and E2. In the joint analysis, the compound symmetry structure for the genotypic effects presented the best fit. The likelihood ratio test showed that some effects changed regarding significance when the SPA and NSPA models were used. In addition, the heritability, selective accuracy, and selection gain were higher when the SPA models were used. This indicates the power of the SPA model in dealing with spatial trends. The SPA model exhibits higher reliability values and is recommended to be incorporated in the standard procedure of genetic evaluation in maize breeding. The analyses bring the parents 2, 10 and 12, as potential parents in this microregion."
https://openalex.org/W3205566002,"Locally harvested wild edible plants (WEPs) provide food as well as cash income for indigenous peoples and local communities, and they are of great importance in ensuring local food security. However, their uses and availability are poorly documented. This study aimed to enumerate WEP diversity and status of WEPs in a part of the Annapurna Conservation Area, Sikles region, where the population is dominated by the Gurung community. Ethnobotanical data were collected using guided field walks, semi-structured interviews, and field observation. The informant consensus method was employed and group discussions were conducted for triangulation of the information. Free listing and identification tests were performed to assess the knowledge of the informants. Both descriptive statistics and quantitative ethnobotanical methods were used for data analysis. A total of 72 wild food species belonging to 46 families and 61 genera were reported from the study area. Asparagaceae and Rosaceae were the dominant families, and herbs were the dominant life form. Fruits (34 species) were the most frequently used plant parts, followed by young shoots (16 species). Most edible plants were consumed in summer and during rainy seasons. While the age and type of informants had an influence on the number of enumerated plants, gender did not. Key informants and people aged 30-45 reported more species than other groups of respondents. Most of the knowledge about the use of WEPs was acquired from parents and relatives. The consumption of these plants was attributed to diversifying cuisine, spicing staple food, nutri-medicinal values, and cultural practices. People perceived the availability of WEPs to be gradually decreasing. However, WEPs are still abundant and diverse in the study area, and knowledge on their use is well-preserved. These resources provide food and nutrients to local people and can also be a source of cash income. Therefore, the documented information on WEPs may serve as baseline data for further studies on nutritional values and provide guidelines for safe collection. The results also revealed that many wild species are under growing pressure from various anthropogenic factors, suggesting effective community engagement is required for their conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3205501362,"Nitrogen (N2) is the most important source of mineral N for plant growth, which was mainly transported by nitrate transporters (NRTs). However, little is known about the NRT gene family in potato. In this study, StNRT gene family members were identified in potato. In addition, we performed StNRT subfamily classification, gene structure and distribution analysis, and conserved domain prediction using various bioinformatics tools. Totally, 39 StNRT gene members were identified in potato genome, including 33, 4 and 2 member belong to NRT1, NRT2, and NRT3, respectively. These 39 StNRT genes were randomly distributed on all chromosomes. The collinearity results show that StNRT members in potato are closely related to Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum melongena. For the expression, different members of StNRT play different roles in leaves and roots. Especially under sufficient nitrogen conditions, different members have a clear distribution in different tissues. These results provide valuable information for identifying the members of the StNRT family in potato and could provide functional characterization of StNRT genes in further research."
https://openalex.org/W3206138270,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected millions of lives globally. However, the disease has presented more extreme challenges for developing countries that are experiencing economic crises. Studies on COVID-19 symptoms and gut health are scarce and have not fully analyzed possible associations between gut health and disease pathophysiology. Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate a potential association between gut health and COVID-19 severity in the Lebanese community, which has been experiencing a severe economic crisis.This cross-sectional study investigated SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive Lebanese patients. Participants were interviewed and gut health, COVID-19 symptoms, and different metrics were analyzed using simple and multiple logistic regression models.Analysis of the data showed that 25% of participants were asymptomatic, while an equal proportion experienced severe symptoms, including dyspnea (22.7%), oxygen need (7.5%), and hospitalization (3.1%). The mean age of the participants was 38.3 ±0.8 years, and the majority were males (63.9%), married (68.2%), and currently employed (66.7%). A negative correlation was found between gut health score and COVID-19 symptoms (Kendall's tau-b = -0.153, P = 0.004); indicating that low gut health was associated with more severe COVID-19 cases. Additionally, participants who reported unhealthy food intake were more likely to experience severe symptoms (Kendall's tau-b = 0.118, P = 0.049). When all items were taken into consideration, multiple ordinal logistic regression models showed a significant association between COVID-19 symptoms and each of the following variables: working status, flu-like illness episodes, and gut health score. COVID-19 severe symptoms were more common among patients having poor gut health scores (OR:1.31, 95%CI:1.07-1.61; P = 0.008), experiencing more than one episode of flu-like illness per year (OR:2.85, 95%CI:1.58-5.15; P = 0.001), and owning a job (OR:2.00, 95%CI:1.1-3.65; P = 0.023).To our knowledge, this is the first study that showed the impact of gut health and exposure to respiratory viruses on COVID-19 severity in Lebanon. These findings can facilitate combating the pandemic in Lebanon."
https://openalex.org/W3206375373,"Fuzzy set theory and its extended form have been widely used in multiple-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems, among which the interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (IVq-ROFSs) got a lot of attention for its ability of capturing information denoted by interval values. Based on the previous studies, to find a better solution for fusing qualitative quantization information with fuzzy numbers, we propose a novel definition of interval-valued q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic sets (IVq-ROULSs) based on the linguistic scale functions, as well as its corresponding properties, such as operational rules and the comparison method. Furthermore, we utilize the power Muirhead mean operators to construct the information fusion method, and provide a variety of aggregation operators based on the proposed information description environment. A model framework is constructed for solving the MAGDM problem utilizing the proposed method. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the new method and investigate its advantages and superiorities through comparative analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3206671626,"Little is known about the influence of hyperglycemia first detected in pregnancy (HFDP) on weight outcomes in exposed offspring in Africa. We investigated the influence of maternal blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy on offspring weight outcomes at birth and preschool age, in offspring exposed to HFDP, in South Africa.Women diagnosed with HFDP had data routinely collected during the pregnancy and at delivery, at a referral hospital, and the offspring followed up at preschool age. Maternal fasting, oral glucose tolerance test 1 and 2-hour blood glucose were measured at diagnosis of HFDP and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose during the third trimester. Offspring were classified as either those exposed to diabetes first recognized in pregnancy (DIP) or gestational diabetes (GDM). At birth, neonates were classified into macrosomia, low birth weight (LBW), large for gestational age (LGA), appropriate (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA)groups. At preschool age, offspring had height and weight measured and Z-scores for weight, height and BMI calculated.Four hundred and forty-three neonates were included in the study at birth, with 165 exposed to DIP and 278 exposed to GDM. At birth, the prevalence of LGA, macrosomia and LBW were 29.6%, 12.2% and 7.5%, respectively, with a higher prevalence of LGA and macrosomia in neonates exposed to DIP. At pre-school age, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was 26.5%. Maternal third trimester 2-hour postprandial blood glucose was significantly associated with z-scores for weight at birth and preschool age, and both SGA and LGA at birth.In offspring exposed to HFDP, there is a high prevalence of LGA and macrosomia at birth, and overweight and obesity at preschool age, with higher prevalence in those exposed to DIP, compared to GDM. Maternal blood glucose control during the pregnancy influences offspring weight at birth and preschool age."
https://openalex.org/W3206970571,"Objectives Older adults are particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of antipsychotic exposure and are disproportionally affected by higher mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our goal was to determine whether concurrent antipsychotic medication use was associated with increased COVID-19 mortality in older patients with preexisting behavioral health problems. We also report on findings from post-COVID follow-ups. Design Retrospective observational study. Participants Outpatients at a geriatric psychiatric clinic in New York City. Measurements Demographic and clinical data including medication, diagnosis and Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) scales on outpatients who had COVID-19 between February 28 th and October 1 st 2020 were extracted from the electronic health records (EHR) from the hospital. Results A total of 56 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (mean age 76 years; median age 75 years) and 13 (23.2%) died. We found an increased mortality risk for patients who were prescribed at least one antipsychotic medication at the time of COVID-19 infection (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.009, OR = 11.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.4–96.0). This result remains significant after adjusting for age, gender, housing context and dementia (Logistic regression P = 0.035, Beta = 2.4). Furthermore, we found that most patients who survived COVID-19 (88.4%) recovered to pre-COVID baseline in terms of psychiatric symptoms. Comparison of pre- and post-COVID assessments of CGI-S for 33 patients who recovered from COVID-19 were not significantly different. Conclusion We observed a higher COVID-19 mortality associated with concurrent antipsychotics use in older patients receiving behavioral health services. The majority of patients in our geriatric clinic who recovered from COVID-19 appeared to return to their pre-COVID psychiatric function. More precise estimates of the risk associated with antipsychotic treatment in older patients with COVID-19 and other underlying factors will come from larger datasets and meta-analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3207030323,"Medical training is a long process that is not complete until doctors finish specialty training. Getting into specialty training is challenging because of strong competition for limited places, depending on doctors' chosen field. This may have a negative impact on doctor well-being and reduce the efficiency of the medical training system. This study explored the barriers of pre-registrar (junior) doctors getting into specialty training programs to inform tailored support and re-design of speciality entry systems.From March to October 2019, we conducted 32 semi-structured interviews with early-career doctors in Australia, who had chosen their specialty field, and were either seeking entry, currently undertaking or had recently completed various fields of specialty training. We sought reflections about barriers and major influences to getting into specialty training. In comparing and contrasting generated themes, different patterns emerged from doctors targeting traditionally non-competitive specialty fields like General Practice (GP) and other specialties (typically more competitive fields). As a result we explored the data in this dichotomy.Doctors targeting entry to GP specialties had relatively seamless training entry and few specific barriers. In contrast, those pursuing other specialties, regardless of which ones, relayed multiple barriers of: Navigating an unpredictable and complex system with informal support/guidance; Connecting to the right people/networks for relevant experience; Pro-actively planning and differentiating skills with recurrent failure of applications.Our exploratory study suggests that doctors wanting to get into non-GP specialty training may experience strong barriers, potentially over multiple years, with the capacity to threaten their morale and resilience. These could be addressed by a clearinghouse of information about different speciality programs, broader selection criteria, feedback on applications and more formal guidance and professional supports. The absence of challenges identified for doctors seeking entry to GP could be used to promote increased uptake of GP careers."
https://openalex.org/W3207487206,"Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate several critical steps in RNA metabolism, including spliceosome assembly, alternative splicing, and mRNA export. Notably, serine-/arginine- (SR)-rich RBPs are densely phosphorylated compared with the remainder of the proteome. Previously, we showed that dephosphorylation of the splicing factor SRSF2 regulated increased interactions with similar arginine-rich RBPs U1-70K and LUC7L3. However, the large-scale functional and structural impact of these modifications on RBPs remains unclear. In this work, we dephosphorylated nuclear extracts using phosphatase in vitro and analyzed equal amounts of detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions by mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. Correlation network analysis resolved 27 distinct modules of differentially soluble nucleoplasm proteins. We found classes of arginine-rich RBPs that decrease in solubility following dephosphorylation and enrich the insoluble pelleted fraction, including the SR protein family and the SR-like LUC7L RBP family. Importantly, increased insolubility was not observed across broad classes of RBPs. We determined that phosphorylation regulated SRSF2 structure, as dephosphorylated SRSF2 formed high-molecular-weight oligomeric species in vitro. Reciprocally, phosphorylation of SRSF2 by serine/arginine protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) in vitro decreased high-molecular-weight SRSF2 species formation. Furthermore, upon pharmacological inhibition of SRPKs in mammalian cells, we observed SRSF2 cytoplasmic mislocalization and increased formation of cytoplasmic granules as well as cytoplasmic tubular structures that associated with microtubules by immunocytochemical staining. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that phosphorylation may be a critical modification that prevents arginine-rich RBP insolubility and oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W3137234963,"Pediatric optic pathway glioma (OPG) can seriously decrease visual function in the case of progression. Systemic anticancer therapy (SAT) is considered the treatment of first choice for unresectable OPG. New SAT modalities for the treatment of progressive OPG have been introduced in the last decade, including VEGF and MAPK pathway inhibition. This systematic review evaluated the effect of SAT on change in visual acuity and visual field in OPG. A systematic review was performed on SAT for OPG (January 1990 to August 2020). MEDLINE and EMBASE (Ovid) were searched for studies reporting on change in visual acuity and visual field after treatment with SAT for OPG. Overall, 11 series, including 358 patients, fulfilled the eligibility criteria. After follow-up of median 3.7 years (range: cessation of SAT- 8.2 years), improvement in binocular VA was found in 0-45% of studies, stability in 18-77% and a decrease in 0-82%. Two studies reported on change in visual field (improvement in 19% and 71% of patients), although either the change was not defined or the testing strategy was lacking. Considerable heterogeneity was present among the included studies, such as variety in the combinations of SAT administered, status of neurofibromatosis type 1, definition regarding change in visual acuity, 1- or 2-eye analysis, diversity in anatomic location, and extent of follow-up, all of which made meta-analysis inappropriate. This systematic review suggests that the impact of SAT in OPG on visual function is still unclear. The wide ranges reported on the efficacy of SAT and the observed heterogeneity highlight the need for prospective studies with uniform definitions of outcome parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3205182808,"As an energy-saving and environmentally friendly means of transportation, electric vehicles have been advocated and promoted by various countries, resulting in an increase in the number of electric vehicles. The improvement of public charging infrastructure not only drives the development of the electric vehicle industry but also solves the problems of user difficulty in charging and the low utilization rate of charging piles. From the perspective of electric vehicle (EV) user experience, this research establishes a framework of indicators, including the reputation level, service quality, convenience, economy and safety. Second, the objective entropy weight method and the subjective decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method are combined to weight the indicators. Among the indicators, the comprehensive weights of market share (C2), app operation interface (C3), and charging mode (C5) are 0.107, 0.088, and 0.090, respectively, ranking in the top three. These three indicators should be given more attention by public charging infrastructure operators. Finally, three alternative public charging infrastructures are sorted by using the VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method. Since the positive ideal solution Si of h1 (state grid) is 0.084, the negative ideal solution Ri is 0.248, and the comprehensive index Qi is 0.000. All ranking first, this finding indicates that the public charging infrastructure of this operator has strong competitiveness in the market. In addition, the results are consistent with actual news reports, which also proves the effectiveness of the index system and model."
https://openalex.org/W3205240598,"The design of allosteric modulators to control protein function is a key objective in drug discovery programs. Altering functionally essential allosteric residue networks provides unique protein family subtype specificity, minimizes unwanted off-target effects, and helps avert resistance acquisition typically plaguing drugs that target orthosteric sites. In this work, we used protein engineering and dimer interface mutations to positively and negatively modulate the immunosuppressive activity of the proapoptotic human galectin-7 (GAL-7). Using the PoPMuSiC and BeAtMuSiC algorithms, mutational sites and residue identity were computationally probed and predicted to either alter or stabilize the GAL-7 dimer interface. By designing a covalent disulfide bridge between protomers to control homodimer strength and stability, we demonstrate the importance of dimer interface perturbations on the allosteric network bridging the two opposite glycan-binding sites on GAL-7, resulting in control of induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. Molecular investigation of G16X GAL-7 variants using X-ray crystallography, biophysical, and computational characterization illuminates residues involved in dimer stability and allosteric communication, along with discrete long-range dynamic behaviors involving loops 1, 3, and 5. We show that perturbing the protein-protein interface between GAL-7 protomers can modulate its biological function, even when the overall structure and ligand-binding affinity remains unaltered. This study highlights new avenues for the design of galectin-specific modulators influencing both glycan-dependent and glycan-independent interactions."

In this study, we assessed the effects of Mecp2 gene deletion on female rats (Mecp2+/-) and found severe impairments in social behavior [at 8 weeks (w), 12 w, and 23 w of age], motor function [at 16 w and 26 w], and spatial cognition [at 29 w] as well as lower plasma insulin-like growth factor (but not brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and markedly reduced acetylcholine (30%-50%) in multiple brain regions compared to female Mecp2+/+ rats [at 29 w]. Alternatively, changes in brain monoamine levels were relatively small, in contrast to reports on mouse Mecp2 mutants. Female Mecp2-deficient rats express phenotypes resembling RTT and so may provide a robust model for future research on RTT pathobiology and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3206169522,The strain-softening and dilatancy behavior of soft rock is affected by the loading history and the development of structure. This study regards soft rock as a structured and overconsolidated soil and develops a new elastoplastic model based on the classical super yield surface Cam-clay model. The proposed model is capable of capturing the effect of yield surface shape on the mechanical behavior of soft rock by introducing a new yield function. The proposed model is validated against the triaxial test results on different types of soft rocks under drained condition. The comparison results indicate that the proposed model is suitable for describing the constitutive behavior of soft rock.
https://openalex.org/W3206235143,"Joint speech behaviours where speakers produce speech in unison are found in a variety of everyday settings, and have clinical relevance as a temporary fluency-enhancing technique for people who stutter. It is currently unknown whether such synchronisation of speech timing among two speakers is also accompanied by alignment in their vocal characteristics, for example in acoustic measures such as pitch. The current study investigated this by testing whether convergence in voice fundamental frequency (F0) between speakers could be demonstrated during synchronous speech. Sixty participants across two online experiments were audio recorded whilst reading a series of sentences, first on their own, and then in synchrony with another speaker (the accompanist) in a number of between-subject conditions. Experiment 1 demonstrated significant convergence in participants’ F0 to a pre-recorded accompanist voice, in the form of both upward (high F0 accompanist condition) and downward (low and extra-low F0 accompanist conditions) changes in F0. Experiment 2 demonstrated that such convergence was not seen during a visual synchronous speech condition, in which participants spoke in synchrony with silent video recordings of the accompanist. An audiovisual condition in which participants were able to both see and hear the accompanist in pre-recorded videos did not result in greater convergence in F0 compared to synchronisation with the pre-recorded voice alone. These findings suggest the need for models of speech motor control to incorporate interactions between self- and other-speech feedback during speech production, and suggest a novel hypothesis for the mechanisms underlying the fluency-enhancing effects of synchronous speech in people who stutter."
https://openalex.org/W3206731899,"Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities have a significantly increased risk for a critical course of COVID-19. As the SARS-CoV2 virus enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor II (ACE2), drugs which interact with the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) were suspected to influence disease severity.We analyzed 1946 consecutive patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or hypertension enrolled in one of the largest European COVID-19 registries, the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 (LEOSS) registry. Here, we show that angiotensin II receptor blocker intake is associated with decreased mortality in patients with COVID-19 [OR 0.75 (95% CI 0,59-0.96; p = 0.013)]. This effect was mainly driven by patients, who presented in an early phase of COVID-19 at baseline [OR 0,64 (95% CI 0,43-0,96; p = 0.029)]. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly lower incidence of death in patients on an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (n = 33/318;10,4%) compared to patients using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) (n = 60/348;17,2%) or patients who received neither an ACE-inhibitor nor an ARB at baseline in the uncomplicated phase (n = 90/466; 19,3%; p<0.034). Patients taking an ARB were significantly less frequently reaching the mortality predicting threshold for leukocytes (p<0.001), neutrophils (p = 0.002) and the inflammatory markers CRP (p = 0.021), procalcitonin (p = 0.001) and IL-6 (p = 0.049). ACE2 expression levels in human lung samples were not altered in patients taking RAAS modulators.These data suggest a beneficial effect of ARBs on disease severity in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and COVID-19, which is linked to dampened systemic inflammatory activity."
https://openalex.org/W3204980693,"Induction of remission is easily achieved with dietary treatment in dogs diagnosed with Food Responsive Chronic Diarrhea (FRD). Administration of prebiotics and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) may improve epithelial cell integrity and therefore be useful as adjunct treatment. This study evaluated whether the relapse rate of FRD dogs that are switched back to a normal diet can be influenced using supplemental treatment with prebiotics and GAGs. A randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCCT) was performed in dogs diagnosed with FRD. Dogs were diagnosed based on clinical exclusion diagnosis, endoscopic biopsies showing predominantly lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, and response to dietary treatment. Dogs were randomized to be fed a combination of prebiotics and GAGs (group 1) or placebo (group 2) in addition to a hydrolyzed diet. At week 10, a second endoscopy was performed and dogs were switched back to normal diet. Relapse rate was monitored every 2 weeks after that until week 18. Statistical analysis was performed for each outcome (Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index (CCECAI), clinicopathological data, endoscopic scoring, mWSAVA histological scoring index (mWSAVA), and number of relapses following switch to normal diet) using a linear mixed effects model for group comparison. Time, group, and their interactions were included as a fixed effect, whereas each dog was treated as a random effect. Of the 35 dogs enrolled into the clinical trial, 10 in each group reached the point of second endoscopy. A total of 13 dogs (n = 8 in group 1 and n = 5 in group 2) reached the trial endpoint of 18 weeks. After switching back to normal diet, none of the dogs in either group relapsed. No significant differences were found over time or between groups for CCECAI, endoscopy scoring and histological scoring. Although there was a clinical worsening in the placebo group after switching back to the original diet, this was not statistically significant (CCECAI p = 0.58). Post-hoc power calculation revealed that 63 dogs per group would have been needed to detect statistically significant differences in CIBDAI between treatment groups. Standard dietary treatment induced rapid clinical response in all cases, however, additional supplementation with prebiotics and GAGs did not significantly improve clinical outcome within 4 months after switching back to normal diet. Since there are very few RCCT published in CE in dogs, this pilot study provides important power analyses for planning of further studies."
https://openalex.org/W3205133152,"Studies of outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 are uncommon. We studied: 1) association of symptoms with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results; and 2) association of initial RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) in relation to duration of RT-PCR positivity in outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19.This was a cohort study of outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 and at least one symptom. Participants had repeat nasopharyngeal swabs and symptom checklists every 3-5 days until two consecutive RT-PCR tests were negative. RT-PCR tests were used to assess viral load. Antibody tests for COVID-19 were performed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after symptom onset.Twenty-five patients (nine females) were enrolled, ranging in age from 19-58 (median age 28 years). All patients reported at least one symptom, with a median of six symptoms per patient. Symptoms persisted for 6-67 days (median duration 18 days). In all 25 patients, blood samples collected a median of 13 days after symptom onset were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 15 (60%). After a median of 28 days following symptom onset, 23/23 patients with available samples tested positive for antibodies. The longest duration of positive RT-PCR test was 49 days from first positive PCR test (Mean = 27.4, SD = 12.5, Median = 24). Initial Ct was significantly associated with longer duration (β = -1.3, SE = 0.3, p<0.01 per 1 cycle higher) of RT-PCR positivity.In mildly or moderately ill COVID-19 outpatients, RT-PCT tests remained positive for as long as 49 days and test positivity and symptom duration correlated with initial viral load."
https://openalex.org/W3205258786,"The hepato-splanchnic circulation directly influences oxygenation of the abdominal organs and plays an important role in compensating for the blood volume reduction that occurs in the central circulation during hemodialysis (HD) with ultrafiltration. However, the hepato-splanchnic circulation and oxygenation cannot be easily evaluated in the clinical setting of HD therapy. We included 185 HD patients and 15 healthy volunteers as the control group in this study. Before HD, hepatic regional oxygen saturation (rSO2), a marker of hepatic oxygenation reflecting the hepato-splanchnic circulation and oxygenation, was monitored using an INVOS 5100c oxygen saturation monitor. Hepatic rSO2 was significantly lower in patients undergoing HD than in healthy controls (56.4 ± 14.9% vs. 76.2 ± 9.6%, p < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed that hepatic rSO2 was independently associated with body mass index (BMI; standardized coefficient: 0.294), hemoglobin (Hb) level (standardized coefficient: 0.294), a history of cardiovascular disease (standardized coefficient: -0.157), mean blood pressure (BP; standardized coefficient: 0.154), and serum albumin concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.150) in Model 1 via a simple linear regression analysis. In Model 2 using the colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in place of serum albumin concentration, the COP (standardized coefficient: 0.134) was also identified as affecting hepatic rSO2. Basal hepatic oxygenation before HD might be affected by BMI, Hb levels, a history of cardiovascular disease, mean BP, serum albumin concentration, and the COP. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify whether changes in these parameters, including during HD, affect the hepato-splanchnic circulation and oxygenation in HD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3205337697,"The non-pharmacological pain management therapies have a valuable effect in managing moderate to mild pain intensity, especially if demonstrated in the pre-operative phase. The study aimed to explore the nurses' practice toward using non-pharmacological pain management techniques in surgical wards. In a cross-sectional research design, a convenient sample of 47 nurses in the surgical wards in Egyptian hospital (Third Level) participated in the study. Data gathered using modified Non-pharmacological Methods Questionnaire. Results of the study indicated that nurse's perception regarding applying the cognitive-behavioral methods as a distraction and Positive reinforcement techniques were more common (68.1%,53.2%), whereas most of them used emotional support (93.6%) and preferred to demonstrate physical methods. Meanwhile, nurses addressed the barriers to apply nonpharmacological pain management as lack of time, patient unwillingness, and patients' health beliefs. Nevertheless, nurses reported the non-pharmacological pain management is less expensive and has fewer side effects than medication and can demonstrated post-discharge. Nurses play a key role in applying effective and different non-pharmacological therapies in surgical wards. Thus, nurses should be encouraged to demonstrate the non-pharmacological pain management therapies with patients undergoing surgical procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3205556567,"In 2011, member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Regional Office (AFRO) resolved to eliminate Measles by 2020. Our study aims to assess The Gambia's progress towards the set AFRO measles elimination target and highlight surveillance and immunisation gaps to better inform future measles prevention strategies.A retrospective review of measles surveillance data for the period 2011-2019, was extracted from The Gambia case-based measles surveillance database. WHO-UNICEF national coverage estimates were used for estimating national level MCV coverage. Measles post campaign coverage survey coverage estimates were used to estimate national measles campaign coverage.One hundred and twenty-five of the 863 reported suspected cases were laboratory confirmed as measles cases. More than half (53.6%) of the confirmed cases have unknown vaccination status, 24% of cases were vaccinated, 52.8% of cases occurred among males, and 72.8% cases were among urban residents. The incidence of measles cases per million population was lowest (0) in 2011-2012 and highest in 2015 and 2016 (31 and 23 respectively). The indicator for surveillance sensitivity was met in all years except in 2016 and 2019. Children aged 5-9 years (Incidence Rate Ratio-IRR = 0.6) and residents of Central River region (IRR = 0.21) had lower measles risk whilst unvaccinated (Adjusted IRR = 5.95) and those with unknown vaccination status (IRR 2.21) had higher measles risk. Vaccine effectiveness was 89.5%.The Gambia's quest to attain measles elimination status by 2020 has registered significant success but it is unlikely that all target indicators will be met. Vaccination has been very effective in preventing cases. There is variation in measles risk by health region, and it will be important to take it into account when designing prevention and control strategies. The quality of case investigations should be improved to enhance the quality of surveillance for decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3206431745,"In this study, we introduced an efficient subcloning and expression system with two inducible prokaryotic expression promoters, arabinose and lac, in a single plasmid in Escherichia coli. The arabinose promoter unit allows for the expression of a FLAG-tagged protein, while the isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-inducible unit allows for the expression of a Myc-tagged protein. An efficient subcloning (DNA insertion) system (iUnit) follows each promoter. The iUnit, based on a toxin that targets DNA topoisomerase of E. coli, allows for effective selection with arabinose or IPTG induction. With the dual promoter plasmid (pdMAX) system, expressed lacZ (β-galactosidase) activity was significantly decreased compared with the original solo expression system. Despite this disadvantage, we believe that the pdMAX system remains useful. A recombinant plasmid (pdMAX/ara/DsRed/IPTG/EGFP; pdMAX/DsRed/EGFP) with DsRed in the arabinose expression unit and EGFP in the IPTG expression unit showed fluorescent protein expression following additional low-temperature incubation. Thus, the novel pdMAX system allowed efficient subcloning of two different genes and can be used to induce and analyze the expression of two distinct genes. The proposed system can be applied to various types of prokaryotic gene expression analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3207279080,"Randomized placebo-controlled trials have reported efficacy of methylphenidate (MPH) for Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, selection biases due to strict entry criteria may limit the generalizability of the findings. Few ecologically valid studies have investigated effectiveness of MPH in representative clinical populations of children. This independently funded study aims to describe treatment responses and their predictors during the first 12 weeks of MPH treatment using repeated measurements of symptoms and adverse reactions (ARs) to treatment in 207 children recently diagnosed with ADHD. The children were consecutively included from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Centre, Mental Health Services, The Capital Region of Denmark. The children (mean age, 9.6 years [range 7–12], 75.4% males) were titrated with MPH, based on weekly assessments of symptoms (18-item ADHD-rating scale scores, ADHD-RS-C) and ARs. At study-end 187 (90.8%) children reached a mean end-dose of 1.0 mg/kg/day. A normalisation/borderline normalisation on ADHD-RS-C was achieved for 168 (81.2%) children on the Inattention and/or the Hyperactivity-Impulsivity subscale in week 12, and 31 (15.0%) children were nonresponders, which was defined as absence of normalisation/borderline normalisation ( n = 19) or discontinuation due to ARs ( n = 12), and eight (3.8%) children dropped out from follow-up. Nonresponders were characterised by more severe symptoms of Hyperactivity-Impulsivity and global impairment before the treatment. ARs were few; the most prominent were appetite reduction and weight loss. A decrease in AR-like symptoms during the treatment period questions the validity of currently available standard instruments designed to measure ARs of MPH. This ecologically valid observational study supports prior randomized placebo-controlled trials; 81.2% of the children responded favourably in multiple domains with few harmful effects to carefully titrated MPH.

https://openalex.org/W3207515744,"Hypoxia is a common pathway to the progression of end-stage kidney disease. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) encodes an RNA helicase that recognizes viruses including SARS-CoV2, which is responsible for the production of interferon (IFN)-α/β to prevent the spread of viral infection. Recently, RIG-I activation was found under hypoxic conditions, and klotho deficiency was shown to intensify the activation of RIG-I in mouse brains. However, the roles of these functions in renal inflammation remain elusive. Here, for in vitro study, the expression of RIG-I and IFN-α/β was examined in normal rat kidney (NRK)-52E cells incubated under hypoxic conditions (1% O2). Next, siRNA targeting RIG-I or scramble siRNA was transfected into NRK52E cells to examine the expression of RIG-I and IFN-α/β under hypoxic conditions. We also investigated the expression levels of RIG-I and IFN-α/β in 33 human kidney biopsy samples diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. For in vivo study, we induced renal hypoxia by clamping the renal artery for 10 min in wild-type mice (WT mice) and Klotho-knockout mice (Kl-/- mice). Incubation under hypoxic conditions increased the expression of RIG-I and IFN-α/β in NRK52E cells. Their upregulation was inhibited in NRK52E cells transfected with siRNA targeting RIG-I. In patients with IgA nephropathy, immunohistochemical staining of renal biopsy samples revealed that the expression of RIG-I was correlated with that of IFN-α/β (r = 0.57, P<0.001, and r = 0.81, P<0.001, respectively). The expression levels of RIG-I and IFN-α/β were upregulated in kidneys of hypoxic WT mice and further upregulation was observed in hypoxic Kl-/- mice. These findings suggest that hypoxia induces the expression of IFN-α/β through the upregulation of RIG-I, and that klotho deficiency intensifies this hypoxia-induced expression in kidneys."
https://openalex.org/W3206231265,"Inulin is a highly effective prebiotic and an attractive alternative to antibiotic growth promoters for increasing production and maintaining health in chickens. However, how inulin elicits its effects on members of the intestinal microbiota is unknown, even though their importance for energy metabolism and the health of chickens is well documented. A combination of 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing and transcriptomic analysis was used to investigate the effects of supplementing a corn-based basal diet with 1, 2, or 4% inulin or 400 ppm bacitracin on the composition, diversity and activities of carbohydrate-metabolizing organisms (CMOs) in the cecal microbiota of broiler chickens. We found that members of Bacteroides were the most abundant non-starch degrading CMOs, contributing 43.6–52.1% of total glycoside hydrolase genes and 34.6–47.1% activity to the meta-transcriptomes of chickens in the different dietary groups, although members of Parabacteroides , Prevotella , Alistipes , Clostridium , Barnesiella , Blastocystis , Faecalibacterium and others were also actively involved. Inulin and bacitracin inclusion in the basal diet did not change significantly the composition or diversity of these CMOs. Inulin supplementation at three levels promoted the activities of Bacteroides , Prevotella and Bifidobacterium , and 2% level appears to be the most optimal dosage for bifidobacterial activity."
https://openalex.org/W3206332511,"Quantitative studies of the multiple factors influencing the mountain-mass effect, which causes higher temperatures in mountainous than non-mountainous regions, remain insufficient. This study estimated the air temperature in the Yellow River Basin, which spans three different elevation ranges, using multi-source data to address the uneven distribution of regional meteorological stations. The differences in mountain-mass effect for different geomorphic regions at the same altitude were then compared. The Manner-Kendall nonparametric test was used to analyse time series changes in temperature. Moreover, we employed the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, with MODIS land-surface and air-temperature data, station-based meteorological data, vertical temperature gradients corresponding to the 2000-2015 period, and elevation data, to estimate the correlation between monthly mean surface temperature and air temperature in the Yellow River Basin. The following major results were obtained. (1) The GWR method and ground station-based observations enhanced the accuracy of air-temperature estimates with an error of only ± 0.74°C. (2) The estimated annual variations in the spatial distributions of 12-month average temperatures showed that the upper Tibetan Plateau is characterised by low annual air temperatures with a narrow spatial distribution, whereas north-eastern areas upstream of the Inner Mongolia Plateau are characterised by higher air temperatures. Changes in the average monthly air temperature were also high in the middle and lower reaches, with a narrow spatial distribution. (3) Considering the seasonal variation in the temperature lapse rate, the mountain-mass effect in the Yellow River Basin was very high. In the middle of each season, the variation of air temperature at a given altitude over the Tibetan Plateau was higher than that over the Loess Plateau and Jinji Mountain. The results of this study reveal the unique temperature characteristics of the Yellow River Basin according to its geomorphology. Furthermore, this research contributes to quantifying mountain-mass effects."
https://openalex.org/W3206959254,"To understand airline transportation networks (ATN) systems we can effectively represent them as multilayer networks, where layers capture different airline companies, the nodes correspond to the airports and the edges to the routes between the airports. We focus our study on the importance of leveraging synthetic generative multilayer models to support the analysis of meaningful patterns in these routes, capturing an ATN's evolution with an emphasis on measuring its resilience to random or targeted attacks and considering deliberate locations of airports. By resorting to the European ATN and the United States ATN as exemplary references, in this work, we provide a systematic analysis of major existing synthetic generation models for ATNs, specifically ANGEL, STARGEN and BINBALL. Besides a thorough study of the topological aspects of the ATNs created by the three models, our major contribution lays on an unprecedented investigation of their spectral characteristics based on Random Matrix Theory and on their resilience analysis based on both site and bond percolation approaches. Results have shown that ANGEL outperforms STARGEN and BINBALL to better capture the complexity of real-world ATNs by featuring the unique properties of building a multiplex ATN layer by layer and of replicating layers with point-to-point structures alongside hub-spoke formations."
https://openalex.org/W3207150965,"Further improvement of the thermostability of inherently thermostable proteins is an attractive challenge because more thermostable proteins are industrially more useful and serve as better scaffolds for protein engineering. To establish guidelines that can be applied for the rational design of hyperthermostable proteins, we compared the amino acid sequences of two ancestral nucleoside diphosphate kinases, Arc1 and Bac1, reconstructed in our previous study. Although Bac1 is a thermostable protein whose unfolding temperature is around 100°C, Arc1 is much more thermostable with an unfolding temperature of 114°C. However, only 12 out of 139 amino acids are different between the two sequences. In this study, one or a combination of amino acid(s) in Bac1 was/were substituted by a residue(s) found in Arc1 at the same position(s). The best mutant, which contained three amino acid substitutions (S108D, G116A and L120P substitutions), showed an unfolding temperature more than 10°C higher than that of Bac1. Furthermore, a combination of the other nine amino acid substitutions also led to improved thermostability of Bac1, although the effects of individual substitutions were small. Therefore, not only the sum of the contributions of individual amino acids, but also the synergistic effects of multiple amino acids are deeply involved in the stability of a hyperthermostable protein. Such insights will be helpful for future rational design of hyperthermostable proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3207252851,"Balancing the benefits and harms of mammography screening is difficult and involves a value judgement. Screening is both a medical and a social intervention, therefore public opinion could be considered when deciding if mammography screening programmes should be implemented and continued. Opinion polls have revealed high levels of public enthusiasm for cancer screening, however, the public tends to overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms. In the search for better public decision on mammography screening, this study investigated the quality of public opinion arising from a Deliberative Poll. In a Deliberative Poll a representative group of people is brought together to deliberate with each other and with experts based on specific information. Before, during and after the process, the participants' opinions are assessed. In our Deliberative Poll a representative sample of the Danish population aged between 18 and 70 participated. They studied an online video and took part in five hours of intense online deliberation. We used survey data at four timepoints during the study, from recruitment to one month after the poll, to estimate the quality of decisions by the following outcomes: 1) Knowledge; 2) Ability to form opinions; 3) Opinion stability, and 4) Opinion consistency. The proportion of participants with a high level of knowledge increased from 1% at recruitment to 56% after receiving video information. More people formed an opinion regarding the effectiveness of the screening programme (12%), the economy of the programme (27%), and the ethical dilemmas of screening (10%) due to the process of information and deliberation. For 11 out of 14 opinion items, the within-item correlations between the first two inquiry time points were smaller than the correlations between later timepoints. This indicates increased opinion stability. The correlations between three pairs of opinion items deemed theoretically related a priori all increased, indicating increased opinion consistency. Overall, the combined process of online information and deliberation increased opinion quality about mammography screening by increasing knowledge and the ability to form stable and consistent opinions."

However, in the event of surgeries requiring a frontal approach, placement of the electrode may be impossible at the designated area to achieve a proper BIS measurement.We developed an investigational interface device to connect needle-electrodes to BIS sensors. The safety and clinical performance were investigated in patients who underwent surgery. Direct BIS values from a disposable BIS electrode and indirect values via the interface device were simultaneously recorded from the same areas of electrode placement in a single patient. The agreement between the direct and indirect BIS values was statistically analyzed.The interface device with a silver electrode demonstrated sufficient electric conduction to transmit electroencephalogram signals. The overall BIS curves were similar to those of direct BIS monitoring. Direct and indirect BIS values from 18 patients were statistically analyzed using a linear mixed model and a significant concordance was confirmed (indirect BIS = 7.0405 + 0.8286 * direct BIS, p<0.0001). Most observed data (2582/2787 data points, 92.64%) had BIS unit differences of 10 or less.The interface device provides an opportunity for intraoperative BIS monitoring of patients, whose clinical situation does not permit the placement of conventional adhesive sensors at the standard location."

We conducted topic modelling (n = 36,715 tweets) and longitudinal social network analysis (n = 17,834 tweets) of probiotic chatter on Twitter from 2009-17. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to build the topic models and network analysis tool Gephi for building yearly graphs. We identified the top 10 topics of probiotics-related communication on Twitter and a constant rise in communication activity. However the number of communities grew consistently to peak in 2014 before dipping and levelling off by 2017. While several probiotics industry actors appeared and disappeared during this period, the influence of one specific actor rose from a hub initially to an authority in the latter years. With multi-brand advertising and probiotics promotions mostly occupying the Twitter chatter, scientists, journalists, or policymakers exerted minimal influence in these communities. Consistent with previous research, we find that probiotics-related content on social media veers towards promotions and benefits. Probiotic industry actors maintain consistent presence on Twitter while transitioning from hubs to authorities over time; scientific entities assume an authoritative role without much engagement. The involvement of scientific, journalistic or regulatory stakeholders will help create a balanced informational environment surrounding probiotic products."

However, clinical studies are conflicting, possibly due to use of non-specific outcomes reflecting a mix of large and small airway LRTI lacking specificity for acute lung or organ injury.We developed a global ordinal scale to differentiate large and small airway LRTI in hospitalized adults with influenza using physiologic features and interventions (PFIs): vital signs, laboratory and radiographic findings, and clinical interventions. We reviewed the literature to identify common PFIs across 9 existing scales of pneumonia and sepsis severity. To characterize patients using this scale, we applied the scale to an antiviral clinical trial dataset where these PFIs were measured through routine clinical care in adults hospitalized with influenza-associated LRTI during the 2010-2013 seasons.We evaluated 12 clinical parameters among 1020 adults; 210 (21%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza, with a median severity score of 4.5 (interquartile range, 2-8). Among influenza cases, median age was 63 years, 20% were hospitalized in the prior 90 days, 50% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 22% had congestive heart failure. Primary influencers of higher score included pulmonary infiltrates on imaging (48.1%), heart rate ≥110 beats/minute (41.4%), oxygen saturation <93% (47.6%) and respiratory rate >24 breaths/minute (21.0%). Key PFIs distinguishing patients with severity < or ≥8 (upper quartile) included infiltrates (27.1% vs 90.0%), temperature ≥ 39.1°C or <36.0°C (7.1% vs 27.1%), respiratory rate >24 breaths/minute (7.9% vs 47.1%), heart rate ≥110 beats/minute (29.3% vs 65.7%), oxygen saturation <90% (14.3% vs 31.4%), white blood cell count >15,000 (5.0% vs 27.2%), and need for invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation (2.1% vs 15.7%).We developed a scale in adults hospitalized with influenza-associated LRTI demonstrating a broad distribution of physiologic severity which may be useful for future studies evaluating the disease attenuating effects of influenza vaccination or other therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3206198319,"Increasing economic integration and global synchronization can be key for countries aiming to catch up in GDP per capita terms. Little attention has hitherto been placed in synchronization as determinant of convergence. In this paper we estimate the effect of economic globalization and synchronization on income convergence for a sample of 89 developed and developing countries in the period 1970-2015. We use a dynamic factor model and panel data techniques to undertake the objectives of the paper. We show that synchronized countries (those correlated with the factor) exhibit a higher response on GDP per capita growth with variations on the global business cycle. This implies that synchronization improves growth for that group in global expansionary phases, but also implies risks during global recessions. On the contrary, the effect on growth of an economic globalization index is less relevant for synchronized countries than for asynchronized countries. The latter result implies that asynchronized countries can benefit more increasing their levels of economic globalization."

We developed a neural network model that includes eight factual findings, such as the relationship between the parents and their economic resources, the child's opinion, and the psychological report on the type of custody. We performed a temporal validation using cases later in time than those in the training sample for prediction. Our system predicted the court's decisions with an accuracy exceeding 85%. We obtained easy-to-apply decision rules with the decision tree technique. The paper contributes by identifying the factors that best predict joint custody, which is useful for parents, lawyers, and prosecutors. Parents would do well to know these findings before venturing into a courtroom."
https://openalex.org/W3206347085,"The most basic level of eukaryotic gene regulation is the presence or absence of nucleosomes on DNA regulatory elements. In an effort to elucidate in vivo nucleosome patterns, in vitro studies are frequently used. In vitro , short DNA fragments are more favorable for nucleosome formation, increasing the likelihood of nucleosome occupancy. This may in part result from the fact that nucleosomes prefer to form on the terminal ends of linear DNA. This phenomenon has the potential to bias in vitro reconstituted nucleosomes and skew results. If the ends of DNA fragments are known, the reads falling close to the ends are typically discarded. In this study we confirm the phenomenon of end bias of in vitro nucleosomes. We describe a method in which nearly identical libraries, with different known ends, are used to recover nucleosomes which form towards the terminal ends of fragmented DNA. Finally, we illustrate that although nucleosomes prefer to form on DNA ends, it does not appear to skew results or the interpretation thereof."
https://openalex.org/W3206881953,"The aim of this study was to assess the potential use of a new advanced inertial navigation system for guiding dental implant placement and to compare this approach with standard stereolithographic template guiding. A movement processing unit with a 9-axis absolute orientation sensor was adapted to a surgical handpiece and wired to a computer navigation interface. Sixty implants were placed by 10 operators in 20 jaw models. The 30 implants of the test group were placed in 10 models guided by the new inertial navigation prototype. The 30 implants of the control group were placed in another 10 models using a CAD-CAM template. Both groups were subdivided into experienced and non-experienced operators. Pre- and postoperative computer tomography images were obtained and matched to compare the planned and final implant positions. Four deviation parameters (global, angular, depth, and lateral deviation) were defined and calculated. The primary outcome was the angular deviation between the standard stereolithographic approach and the new inertial navigation system. Results showed no significant differences between both groups, suggesting that surgical navigation based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) could potentially be useful for guiding dental implant placement. However, more studies are still needed to translate this new approach into clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3206949653,"Genetic and molecular modifications of the large dsDNA chloroviruses, with genomes of 290 to 370 kb, would expedite studies to elucidate the functions of both identified and unidentified virus-encoded proteins. These plaque-forming viruses replicate in certain unicellular, eukaryotic chlorella-like green algae. However, to date, only a few of these algal species and virtually none of their viruses have been genetically manipulated due to lack of practical methods for genetic transformation and genome editing. Attempts at using Agrobacterium -mediated transfection of chlorovirus host Chlorella variabilis NC64A with a specially-designed binary vector resulted in successful transgenic cell selection based on expression of a hygromycin-resistance gene, initial expression of a green fluorescence gene and demonstration of integration of Agrobacterium T-DNA. However, expression of the integrated genes was soon lost. To develop gene editing tools for modifying specific chlorovirus CA-4B genes using preassembled Cas9 protein-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), we tested multiple methods for delivery of Cas9/sgRNA RNP complexes into infected cells including cell wall-degrading enzymes, electroporation, silicon carbide (SiC) whiskers, and cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). In one experiment two independent virus mutants were isolated from macerozyme-treated NC64A cells incubated with Cas9/sgRNA RNPs targeting virus CA-4B-encoded gene 034r , which encodes a glycosyltransferase. Analysis of DNA sequences from the two mutant viruses showed highly targeted nucleotide sequence modifications in the 034r gene of each virus that were fully consistent with Cas9/RNP-directed gene editing. However, in ten subsequent experiments, we were unable to duplicate these results and therefore unable to achieve a reliable system to genetically edit chloroviruses. Nonetheless, these observations provide strong initial suggestions that Cas9/RNPs may function to promote editing of the chlorovirus genome, and that further experimentation is warranted and worthwhile."
https://openalex.org/W3205015576,"In the light of an increased use of premium intraocular lenses (IOL), such as EDOF IOLs, multifocal IOLs or toric IOLs even minor intraoperative complications such as decentrations or an IOL tilt, will hamper the visual performance of these IOLs. Thus, the post-operative analysis of cataract surgeries to detect even minor intraoperative deviations that might explain a lack of a post-operative success becomes more and more important. Up-to-now surgical videos are evaluated by just looking at a very limited number of intraoperative data sets, or as done in studies evaluating the pupil changes that occur during surgeries, in a small number intraoperative picture only. A continuous measurement of pupil changes over the whole surgery, that would achieve clinically more relevant data, has not yet been described. Therefore, the automatic retrieval of such events may be a great support for a post-operative analysis. This would be especially true if large data files could be evaluated automatically. In this work, we automatically detect pupil reactions in cataract surgery videos. We employ a Mask R-CNN architecture as a segmentation algorithm to segment the pupil and iris with pixel-based accuracy and then track their sizes across the entire video. We can detect pupil reactions with a harmonic mean (H) of Recall, Precision, and Ground Truth Coverage Rate (GTCR) of 60.9% and average prediction length (PL) of 18.93 seconds. However, we consider the best configuration for practical use the one with the H value of 59.4% and PL of 10.2 seconds, which is much shorter. We further investigate the generalization ability of this method on a slightly different dataset without retraining the model. In this evaluation, we achieve the H value of 49.3% with the PL of 18.15 seconds."
https://openalex.org/W3205194359,"To evaluate and compare the clinical and histopathological profile of primary and recurrent orbital-periorbital plexiform neurofibromas (OPPN) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. We retrospectively evaluated 43 primary or recurrent neurofibroma (NF) specimens from 26 patients (2002 to 2018) at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Saudi Arabia. Demographics, clinical presentation, and surgical intervention data were collected. Histopathological specimens were studied with hematoxylin-eosin, Alcian blue, and immunohistochemical markers; S-100, CD44, CD117, smooth muscle actin (SMA), neurofilament, and Ki-67. Of the 43 NFs specimens, 20 were primary and 23 recurrent tumors. For primary NF, the ratio of plexiform to the diffuse type was 13:7, however in recurrent tumors was 3:8 after the first recurrence, and 1:5 after multiple recurrences. Of the 17 patients with primary tumors that had paired recurrent tumors, 12/17 (70.6%) primary NFs were plexiform and 5/17 (29.4%) were diffuse. However, when tumors recurred, 13/17 tumors (76.5%) were diffuse and only 4/17 tumors (23.5%) had a plexiform pattern. The odds of a tumor having a diffuse pattern in recurrent NF was significantly higher than the plexiform pattern [OR = 7.8 (95% confidence interval 1.69:36.1) P = 0.008]. Primary plexiform NFs underwent an excision at a significantly younger age than the diffuse type. Recurrent NFs had significantly higher CD44, CD117, and neurofilament labeling (P = 0.02, P = 0.01 and P<0.001 respectively) but had significantly decreased Alcian blue, and S-100 labeling (P = 0.03, and P = 0.02 respectively) compared to primary tumors. SMA and Ki-67 proliferation index were not different between primary and recurrent NFs (P = 0.86, and P = 0.3 respectively). There appears to be a high risk for primary plexiform NFs to develop a diffuse histologic pattern when they recur. Immunohistochemical staining suggests a role of mast cells (CD117) and expression of infiltration makers (CD44) in the transformation of plexiform tumors to the diffuse phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3205741191,"RORγt is an isoform of RORC, preferentially expressed in Th17 cells, that functions as a critical regulator of type 3 immunity. As murine Th17-driven inflammatory disease models were greatly diminished in RORC knock-out mice, this receptor was prioritised as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of several autoimmune diseases. Human genetic studies indicate a significant contributory role for RORC in several human disease conditions. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) report a significant association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the RORC regulatory variant rs4845604. To investigate if the rs4845604 variant may affect CD4+ T cell differentiation events, naïve CD4+ T cells were isolated from eighteen healthy subjects homozygous for the rs4845604 minor (A) or major (G) allele). Isolated cells from each subject were differentiated into distinct T cell lineages by culturing in either T cell maintenance medium or Th17 driving medium conditions for six days in the presence of an RORC inverse agonist (to prevent constitutive receptor activity) or an inactive diastereomer (control). Our proof of concept study indicated that genotype had no significant effect on the mean number of naïve CD4 T cells isolated, nor the frequency of Th1-like and Th17-like cells following six days of culture in any of the four culture conditions. Analysis of the derived RNA-seq count data identified genotype-driven transcriptional effects in each of the four culture conditions. Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis of these profiles reported perturbation of metabolic signalling networks, with the potential to affect the cellular detoxification response. This investigation reveals that rs4845604 genotype is associated with transcriptional effects in CD4+ T cells that may perturb immune and metabolic pathways. Most significantly, the rs4845604 GG, IBD risk associated, genotype may be associated with a differential detoxification response. This observation justifies further investigation in a larger cohort of both healthy and IBD-affected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3206110339,"Current theories about visual perception assume that our perceptual system weights the a priori incomplete, noisy and ambiguous sensory information with previous, memorized perceptual experiences in order to construct stable and reliable percepts. These theories are supported by numerous experimental findings. Theories about precognition have an opposite point of view. They assume that information from the future can have influence on perception, thoughts, and behavior. Several experimental studies provide evidence for precognition effects, other studies found no such effects. One problem may be that the vast majority of precognition paradigms did not systematically control for potential effects from the perceptual history. In the present study, we presented ambiguous Necker cube stimuli and disambiguated cube variants and systematically tested in two separate experiments whether perception of a currently observed ambiguous Necker cube stimulus can be influenced by a disambiguated cube variant, presented in the immediate perceptual past (perceptual history effects) and/or in the immediate perceptual future (precognition effects). We found perceptual history effects, which partly depended on the length of the perceptual history trace but were independent of the perceptual future. Results from some individual participants suggest on the first glance a precognition pattern, but results from our second experiment make a perceptual history explanation more probable. On the group level, no precognition effects were statistically indicated. The perceptual history effects found in the present study are in confirmation with related studies from the literature. The precognition analysis revealed some interesting individual patterns, which however did not allow for general conclusions. Overall, the present study demonstrates that any future experiment about sensory or extrasensory perception urgently needs to control for potential perceptual history effects and that temporal aspects of stimulus presentation are of high relevance."
https://openalex.org/W3207452127,"Varicella infection is a highly contagious disease which, whilst mild in most cases, can cause severe complications. Varicella vaccination is available privately in Sweden and is currently being reviewed for inclusion in the Swedish Public Health Agency's national immunisation program (NIP). A cross-sectional study of parents of Swedish children aged 1-8 years (n = 2212) was conducted to understand parental acceptance, beliefs and knowledge around varicella infection and vaccination. Respondents generally viewed varicella infection as a mild disease, with only a small proportion aware of potential severe complications. While 65% of respondents were aware of the vaccine, only 15% had started the course of vaccination as of February 2019. Further, 43% of parents did not intend to vaccinate, most commonly due to lack of inclusion in the NIP, but also due to perception of mild disease. Nevertheless, if offered within the NIP, 85% of parents would be highly likely to vaccinate their child. A number of statistically significant differences in awareness and behaviours were observed between sociodemographic subgroups. In general, women were more aware of vaccination (72%) compared to men (58%). Among unemployed or respondents with elementary school education, awareness was below 43%, and among respondents with high income the awareness was above 75%. Similarly, among unemployed or respondents with a low income the vaccination rate was as low as 30% compared with at least 57% among respondents with a high income. Respondents from metropolitan areas, those with university degrees and respondents with a higher income were more likely to be aware of the varicella vaccine and to have vaccinated their child. Whilst inclusion in the NIP is clearly the main driver for uptake, these identified knowledge gaps should inform educational efforts to ensure that all parents are informed of the availability and benefits of the varicella vaccine independent of socioeconomic status."
