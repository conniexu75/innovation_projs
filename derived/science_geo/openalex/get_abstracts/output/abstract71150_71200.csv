https://openalex.org/W1597958271,"Abstract The allosteric mechanism of phosphorylase b activation by inosine monophosphate has been investigated and compared with AMP activation of this enzyme. Enzyme activity was measured in the direction of glycogen synthesis. In contrast to AMP, IMP affected the Vmax but not the enzyme affinity toward glucose-1-P. The plots of initial rate (vi) against glucose-1-P concentration for IMP activation were sigmoidal, having Hill coefficients of 2, the homotropic cooperativity of glucose-1-P being independent of nucleotide concentration. The plots of vi against IMP concentration were sigmoidal at low glucose-1-P concentrations but hyperbolic at high substrate. In the presence of 0.3 m sodium fluoride the kinetics was normalized, resulting in an increased nucleotide affinity. Under these conditions the Km values of AMP and IMP activation were both independent of substrate concentration; only the Vmax changed with increasing glucose-1-P. The kinetic data suggest that the mechanism of nucleotide activation results in a two-stage allosteric transition of the enzyme, viz., a change in both catalytic efficiency and enzyme affinity toward glucose-1-P. This proposed mechanism receives support from the following physical criteria. AMP, IMP, and glucose-1-P show varying degrees of protection against cold inactivation and the removal of pyridoxal phosphate from the enzyme. While AMP causes partial dimerization of phosphorylase b, IMP may dimerize the enzyme only in the presence of glucose-1-P."

Two of 20 Caucasians tested were intolerant to milk and lactose. Many Orientals therefore may have a genetically determined lactase deficiency that may lead to intolerance to milk. Since lactase deficiency is also common among Negroes, the bulk of the world's adult population is probably intolerant to milk."

https://openalex.org/W2412139510,"Abstract The amino acid analysis of pea embryo histone IV showed the presence of 102 residues distributed as follows: Lys10, His2, Arg15, Asp5, Thr7, Ser2, Glu6, Pro1, Gly17, Ala7, Val8, Met1, Ile7, Leu8, Tyr4, and Phe2. The composition of calf thymus histone IV was identical except for the presence of 1 residue of e-N-methyllysine, an additional residue of valine, 1 residue less of arginine and isoleucine, and possibly 1 less residue of glycine. Sequence studies on an 18-residue cyanogen bromide peptide from both histones established the identical COOH-terminal sequence -Met-Asp-Val-Val-Tyr-Ala-Leu-Lys-Arg-Gln-Gly-Arg-Thr-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly-COOH for both proteins. The identity of this region and the similar amino acid compositions suggest that the remainder of the sequence of this histone from both the animal and the plant must be closely related. The evolutionary and functional implications of this remarkable similarity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1557705851,"Abstract Rat liver alanine aminotransferase has been crystallized and has a specific activity of 500 to 550 units (micromoles per min) per mg. The enzyme contains two pyridoxal phosphate groups and 23 to 30 titratable sulfhydryl equivalents per molecule (114,000 daltons). The amino acid composition has been determined and includes 34 half-cystine residues per molecule. Reaction of the first seven or eight sulfhydryl groups with p-mercuribenzoate or 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) led to no loss of activity, after which there was a loss of activity proportional to the extent of reaction of the next 16 equivalents with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Resolution and partial reconstitution of the apoenzyme has been achieved. The spectrum of the pyridoxal form of the enzyme is pH dependent, with an acid peak at 430 mµ, a basic peak at 335 mµ, and an isosbestic point at 380 mµ."
https://openalex.org/W1523878873,"Abstract During morphogenesis in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, trehalose-6-P synthetase activity, undetectable in the vegetative cell, appears, accumulates to a peak, and then disappears. Both the accumulation and disappearance are sensitive to coincident inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide and prior inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D. The normal pattern of changes in enzyme activity observed in the wild type is modified in specific ways in mutants displaying morphogenetic aberrations."

The period of synthesis of these proteins coincides with the irreversible commitment of a certain cytoplasmic region to initiate events leading to a visibly polar cell.
https://openalex.org/W1553465747,"Abstract Fragments of bovine retinal outer segments (ROS) containing intact photoreceptor discs took up protons from an aqueous medium upon illumination. Proton uptake in the light required the presence in the ROS of unbleached rhodopsin. After light exposure had bleached the visual pigment, it no longer absorbed light and proton uptake did not occur. The action spectrum of the proton uptake conformed to the unbleached minus bleached difference spectrum of the ROS. Moreover, reconstitution of the visual pigment by incubating the bleached ROS in darkness with 11-cis retinal resulted in recovery of the light-induced proton uptake. In the presence of Triton X-100, the ROS membranes became dispersed, but the light-induced proton uptake persisted below about pH 6. However, at higher pH release of protons from the dispersed ROS was observed. The stoichiometric ratio between protons taken up or released and rhodopsin bleached could be experimentally changed from more than 5 taken up to about 3 released in Triton X-100. This finding does not provide support for a proposal offered by previous investigators that a light-induced pH increase was attributable to uptake of exactly 1 proton per molecule of visual pigment bleached."

https://openalex.org/W974190226,"An enzyme-substrate (glutamine) complex was isolated from an incubation of highly purified formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase with glutamine followed by filtration on Sephadex gel. The reaction leading to the formation of this complex was reversible and did not depend on the presence of the rest of the substrates and the metal ion cofactor (formylglycinamide ribonucleotide, ATP, and magnesium ion). Azaserine inhibits completely complex formation. The binding ratio of glutamine to the enzyme in molar units was approximately 1:1. At 2° the half-life of the complex when isolated on Sephadex G-50 was about 125 min. Analysis of the radioactive material produced from the complex after denaturation of the enzyme with acid showed that during complex formation the glutamyl moiety of glutamine was bound to the enzyme, presumably as γ-glutamyl-enzyme complex, with release of the amide nitrogen of glutamine. Ammonia could replace the amide nitrogen of glutamine as the nitrogen donor but its reactivity compared to that of glutamine was relatively low. Hydroxylamine competed with ammonia in a strictly competitive manner to inhibit the formation of the product, formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide."

https://openalex.org/W2036118028,"Optical rotatory dispersion of human blood-group and virus receptor glycoproteins from erythrocytes and secretions was studied in the far-ultraviolet. Erythrocyte membrane blood-group glycoproteins, with potent virus receptor activities, contained significant alpha-helical and extended beta conformations, whereas the glycoproteins of secretions were largely disordered. These conclusions were supported by determination of the Moffitt constants (b(0)) and by measurements of circular dichroism."

https://openalex.org/W1513419693,"Abstract The sulfite:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (EC 1.8.7.1) of bovine liver has been partially purified by a simple procedure. The preparations obtained gave no spectral evidence of heme components and had very little ability to transfer electrons to oxygen while being very active with cytochrome c. The response of the enzyme to changes in the concentrations of sulfite or of cytochrome c was that to be expected for a ping-pong mechanism. Ks for sulfite under the conditions used was 2.2 x 10-5 m. Anions, both monovalent and divalent, were inhibitory; none were competitive with respect to sulfite. Sulfate was competitive with respect to cytochrome c. Ki for sulfate was 3.5 x 10-3 m. Ks for ferricytochrome c in the absence of inhibitory anions was calculated to be 2.1 x 10-8 m. Bubbling solutions of ferricytochrome c with nitrogen or otherwise exposing them to gas-liquid, liquid-liquid, or solid-liquid interfaces was found to generate polymers of cytochrome c. The higher polymers of cytochrome c, were found to be potent inhibitors of the sulfite:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, competitive with respect to cytochrome c. The inhibition observed varied as the 2.56th power of the concentration of the polymerized cytochrome c. Ferrocytochrome c was resistant to the formation of polymers when exposed to interfaces. Yeast ferricytochrome c was unique among the ferricytochromes c tested in also being resistant to polymerization when exposed to interfaces."

The polysaccharide behaves as an anionic polyelectrolyte and experimental evidence indicates the presence of 2-acetamido-2 deoxy-d-glucuronic acid, 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucosamine, and 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-glucosamine in a 2:1:2 molar ratio. The preparation was also antigenic and is of structural interest in that it contains analogues of glucosamine with either an equatorial carboxyl or methyl substituent attached to carbon atom 5."

https://openalex.org/W178392419,"1. The glycine-rich, arginine-rich (GAR) histone from calf thymus, which contains 1 methionine residue, was cleaved with cyanogen bromide to yield two peptides which were fractionated on Sephadex G-100. 2. The smaller peptide was isolated and contained 18 amino acids. This peptide was the carboxyl-terminal portion of the GAR histone since it did not contain homoserine, and aspartic acid was the amino-terminal amino acid. The amino-terminal amino acid of the whole GAR histone is acetylserine. The carboxyl-terminal sequence of the whole GAR histone was found to be Gly-Gly-COOH by treatment with carboxypeptidase which agreed with the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the octadecapeptide. 3. This octadecapeptide was found to contain 2 of the 4 tyrosine and 1 of the 2 phenylalanine residues contained in the whole GAR histone. 4. The total sequence of this octadecapeptide was determined after tryptic and chymotryptic hydrolysis to be: Asp-Val-Val-Tyr-Ala-Leu-Lys-Arg-Gln-Gly-Arg-Thr-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly-COOH."

https://openalex.org/W1524589707,"Abstract Methods are described to separate or trap and subsequently characterize the intermediates in the previously reported model oxidative phosphorylation reaction in which ATP is produced from orthophosphate and AMP or ADP during the oxidation of a ferrohemochrome by molecular oxygen in N, N-dimethylacetamide solution containing an excess of imidazole. By using 14C-labeled imidazole and 32P-labeled Pi, it is shown that the energy-rich intermediate is indistinguishable from 1-phosphoimidazole in its chromatographic, electrophoretic, and chemical properties. Similar phosphorylated intermediates can be formed with 2-methylimidazole and 2,4-dimethylimidazole, but not with 1,2-dimethylimidazole. A molecular mechanism of this model oxidative phosphorylation reaction is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1639380365,"Solvent deuterium isotope effects on the kinetics of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate in aqueous solution in the pH range 6 to 9 and at 25° have been investigated. With the use of enzymes isolated both from rabbit muscle and yeast, it has been established that the rate of enzyme acylation by this ester is decreased 2.5-fold in deuterium oxide compared to water under conditions in which the rate is linearly dependent on hydroxide ion concentration but is independent of the isotopic nature of the solvent under more basic conditions in which the rate is independent of the hydroxide ion concentration. In water, the acylation rate constant is dependent on a basic group, the conjugate acid of which has a pKa near 8.2; in deuterium oxide this same group has a pKa near 8.7. This behavior is consistent with an acylation reaction involving the unaided attack of the anionic form of a crucial sulfhydryl residue on p-nitrophenyl acetate within the Michaelis-Menten complex. Closely related behavior is observed for deacylation of the yeast enzyme: the rate is depressed 3-fold by deuterium oxide under conditions of hydroxide ion catalysis but is unaffected by this agent under more basic conditions in which the reaction is pH-independent. Values of pKa for the conjugate acid of the basic species upon which the reaction depends are 8.8 and 9.3 in water and deuterium oxide, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2013313129,"ANIMAL experiments have provided a great deal of information about the interaction of drugs early in pregnancy. Little, however, is known of drug action in the late stages of pregnancy1,2. In our previous studies on the damaging effect of sodium salicylate on the foetus, a tendency to premature birth was observed in the mouse when this substance was given on the seventeenth gestation day3. We have therefore investigated the effect of some other anti-inflammatory drugs on the gestation time."
https://openalex.org/W33420487,"SUMMARY The tyrosines were titrated adding KOH or HCl to the pro- tein solutions in 0.25 M NaCl at 20”. Their ionization was followed by differential spectrophotometry at 245 rnp against a reference solution at pH 8.5. The titrations were reversible only up to pH 10.5. The back titrations from pH 12 indicated that the denaturation of the protein produced a change in the absorption spectrum of the heme in the ultraviolet region. Making correction for this transition, the AC per tyrosyl residue was calculated to be approximately 10,000 for all of the proteins investigated. Considering that only 2 out of 3 tyrosyl residues per chain ionize in the native proteins and neglecting the correction for the electrostatic interaction, the reversible part of the titrations was shown to be consistent with pK near 10.4 for hemoglobin, apohemoglobin, and the 0 chains, with pK near 9.9 for the OL chains. This difference was too large to be accounted for on the basis of the electrical charge of the various proteins. It could indicate a difference in the ionization of the tyrosyl residues of the 01 chains when these are isolated or polymerized with the ,l3 chains in the hemoglobin molecule. In a recent paper detailed comparison was made of the proton- binding behavior of hemoglobin, its isolated subunits, and apohe- moglobin. There it was shown how the (r-p interaction and the heme-globin interaction affects the titration of the histidyl and lysyl residues in hemoglobin (I). The number of tyrosyl residues was too few in comparison to other classes of ionizable groups and with a too high pK in order to have a recognizable influence on the acid-base titration of hemoglobin, which was extended only up to pH 10.4. On the other hand, their ionization can be specifically measured with the spectrophotometer. Many data already exist in the litera- ture on this subject (2-4). Unfortunately, they were all obtained in the presence of buffers of various kinds so they * This work was supported in part by National Institute of Health Grants HE 10785-02 and HE 06308. $ To whom requests for reprints should be addressed. should have been corrected in order to be translated into our experimental conditions. No back titrations are available in the literature so it was impossible to know whether the pK values reported were for the native or for the alkali-denatured protein, and no titrations have been carried out on the isolated cr chains or on native apohemoglobin. For these reasons we felt it neces- sary to reinvestigate the problem starting from the very begin- ning in order to study the effect of the c@ interaction and of the heme-apohemoglobin interaction on the ionization of the tyrosyl residues in hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2047032581,"A FLOWER tends to present most of its pollen at a time of day characteristic of its species. Thus dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) presents its pollen between 0900 and 1500 h, but 63 per cent between 1000 and 1100 h, whereas apple (Pyrus malus) presents its pollen between 0800 and 1700 h, but 67 per cent between 1200 and 1600 h1. When dandelion and apple are flowering in the same area, individual foraging bees tend to be constant to one or other species and when dandelion flowers close for the day very few bees that visited them earlier change to visiting the apple2. It seemed probable therefore that if colonies of bees were prevented from foraging until the afternoon of the first day they were present in an apple orchard, more bees might become conditioned to apple and fewer to dandelion than if they are allowed to forage early in the morning."
