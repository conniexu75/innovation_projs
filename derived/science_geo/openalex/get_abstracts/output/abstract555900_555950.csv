Although most characterized species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are destructive pathogens, we show here that C. tofieldiae (Ct) is an endemic endophyte in natural Arabidopsis thaliana populations in central Spain. Colonization by Ct initiates in roots but can also spread systemically into shoots. Ct transfers the macronutrient phosphorus to shoots, promotes plant growth, and increases fertility only under phosphorus-deficient conditions, a nutrient status that might have facilitated the transition from pathogenic to beneficial lifestyles. The host’s phosphate starvation response (PSR) system controls Ct root colonization and is needed for plant growth promotion (PGP). PGP also requires PEN2-dependent indole glucosinolate metabolism, a component of innate immune responses, indicating a functional link between innate immunity and the PSR system during beneficial interactions with Ct.

In nature, all healthy, asymptomatic plants live in association with a vast diversity of microbes, comprising bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protists, collectively called the plant microbiota. It is now widely accepted that individual plants of distantly related species assemble taxonomically structured bacterial consortia, characterized by the co-occurrence of a few bacterial phyla, and environmental parameters such as soil nutrients drive diversification of the bacterial microbiota at the species or strain level (Lundberg et al., 2012Lundberg D.S. Lebeis S.L. Paredes S.H. Yourstone S. Gehring J. Malfatti S. Tremblay J. Engelbrektson A.

Plant Biol. 2013; 64: 807-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). Similarly, culture-independent community profiling techniques and culture-dependent surveys of surface-sterilized plant tissue revealed an enormous diversity of root-associated fungi, mainly belonging to three phyla, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota (Rodriguez et al., 2009Rodriguez R.J.

Plant compartment and biogeography affect microbiome composition in cultivated and native Agave species.New Phytol. 2016; 209: 798-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, since plant-associated fungal assemblages are hyperdiverse and mainly influenced by the biogeography of the host species (Coleman-Derr et al., 2016Coleman-Derr D. Desgarennes D. Fonseca-Garcia C. Gross S. Clingenpeel S. Woyke T. North G. Visel A. Partida-Martinez L.P. Tringe S.G. Plant compartment and biogeography affect microbiome composition in cultivated and native Agave species.New Phytol. 2016; 209: 798-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), it is difficult to discriminate whether a particular fungal association with a healthy plant is merely the result of a stochastic encounter or has ecophysiological significance. Mycorrhizal fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota are the best-characterized beneficial fungi associated with plant roots, colonize ∼80%–90% of terrestrial plants, and mobilize soil nutrients, including the macronutrient phosphorus, for plant growth (Bonfante and Genre, 2010Bonfante P. Genre A. Mechanisms underlying beneficial plant-fungus interactions in mycorrhizal symbiosis.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). This evolutionarily ancient symbiosis evolved ∼450 million years ago, and the plant signaling pathway needed for mycorrhizal symbiosis is conserved in most flowering plants, but was lost in the Brassicaceae lineage, including Arabidopsis thaliana (Bonfante and Genre, 2010Bonfante P. Genre A. Mechanisms underlying beneficial plant-fungus interactions in mycorrhizal symbiosis.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Phosphorus is one of three macronutrients limiting plant growth in natural soils besides nitrogen and potassium, and synthetic fertilizers providing these macronutrients have been critical for crop productivity in intensive agricultural settings for ∼100 years. Plant roots can absorb only inorganic orthophosphate (Pi), although phosphorus is abundant in many natural soil types both as organic and inorganic pools. Pi can be assimilated by plant roots via low-Pi-inducible (high-affinity) and constitutive Pi uptake systems (López-Arredondo et al., 2014López-Arredondo D.L. Leyva-González M.A. González-Morales S.I. López-Bucio J. Herrera-Estrella L. Phosphate nutrition: improving low-phosphate tolerance in crops.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2014; 65: 95-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Plant-associated bacteria and fungi such as mycorrhizal fungi can mobilize plant-inaccessible inorganic phosphate in soils such as hydroxyapatite and Ca3(PO4)2 by conversion into bioavailable Pi. In addition, plants have evolved a phosphate starvation response (PSR) system that senses phosphate starvation and adjusts root and shoot growth accordingly (Poirier and Bucher, 2002Poirier Y. Bucher M. Phosphate transport and homeostasis in Arabidopsis.Arabidopsis Book. 2002; 1: e0024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic basis of this PSR is well-studied in the model plant A. thaliana (Chiou and Lin, 2011Chiou T.J. Lin S.I. Signaling network in sensing phosphate availability in plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2011; 62: 185-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether the PSR is coordinated with root colonization by beneficial microbes that mobilize Pi for plant growth under low phosphate conditions. Flowering plants synthesize and accumulate a vast array of structurally diverse small molecules known as secondary metabolites. The diversification of several secondary metabolite classes and their corresponding biosynthesis pathways in plants is driven by microbes and insects (Dixon, 2001Dixon R.A. Natural products and plant disease resistance.Nature. 2001; 411: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). One of the best-studied and most diversified compound classes in A. thaliana comprises β-thioglucosides, known as glucosinolates, that are synthesized via branch pathways from methionine, tryptophan (Trp), and phenylalanine (Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006Halkier B.A. Gershenzon J. Biology and biochemistry of glucosinolates.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 303-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The PEN2 myrosinase-dependent metabolism of Trp-derived indole glucosinolates in A. thaliana is activated upon perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system and is needed for broad-spectrum defense to restrict the growth of fungal pathogens (Clay et al., 2009Clay N.K. Adio A.M. Denoux C. Jander G. Ausubel F.M. Glucosinolate metabolites required for an Arabidopsis innate immune response.Science. 2009; 323: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, Bednarek et al., 2009Bednarek P.

Sanchez-Vallet A. et al.A glucosinolate metabolism pathway in living plant cells mediates broad-spectrum antifungal defense.Science. 2009; 323: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Although recent findings provided evidence for a metabolic link between the PSR system and glucosinolate biosynthesis (Pant et al., 2015Pant B.D. Pant P. Erban A. Huhman D. Kopka J. Scheible W.R. Identification of primary and secondary metabolites with phosphorus status-dependent abundance in Arabidopsis, and of the transcription factor PHR1 as a major regulator of metabolic changes during phosphorus limitation.Plant Cell Environ. 2015; 38: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), its functional relevance remains unclear. Here, we have characterized an ascomycete fungal endophyte, Colletotrichum tofieldiae (Ct), that was originally isolated from asymptomatic A. thaliana plants growing at Las Rozas, Spain after surface disinfection of leaf tissue (García et al., 2013García E. Alonso A. Platas G. Sacristan S. The endophytic mycobiota of Arabidopsis thaliana.Fungal Divers. 2013; 60: 71-89Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Colonization experiments with germ-free A. thaliana plants revealed that Ct initiates endophytic growth only via roots and occasionally spreads systemically into shoots without causing discernable disease symptoms. Using 33Pi isotope tracer experiments, we show that Ct, but not the closely related pathogenic species C. incanum (Ci), translocates Pi into the plant via root-associated hyphae only under phosphate starvation conditions. 33Pi translocation is correlated with PGP. Using regulatory mutants of the A. thaliana PSR and mutants of Trp-derived secondary metabolite biosynthetic and regulatory genes, we demonstrate that Ct-mediated PGP needs an intact PEN2 myrosinase-dependent branch pathway for indole glucosinolate hydrolysis and regulatory components of the PSR. Moreover, depletion of all Trp-derived secondary metabolites renders Ct a pathogen of A. thaliana. An analysis of Ct interactions with two A. thaliana relatives, Cardamine hirsuta and Capsella rubella, points to indole glucosinolates as potential determinants of fungal host-range. We hypothesize that Ct is a root endophyte of A. thaliana and other Brassicaceae that might have compensated the loss of components required for mycorrhizal symbiosis in this plant family. We predicted that Ct should be present in healthy plants throughout the year if the fungus establishes a stable endophytic interaction with A. thaliana. We surveyed the distribution of Ct in plants growing at Las Rozas (“LRO”) using qPCR with a Ct-specific primer pair encompassing coding plus intron sequences of the tubulin gene. Ct was detected in more than half of tested plants from both leaves and roots during two seasons (November, April plus May) and in successive years (2009–2012), suggesting the fungus is wide-spread and persistent in this A. thaliana population (Figures 1A, 1B , and S1A). We also detected Ct in samples from wild populations of A. thaliana at Ciruelos de Coca (“CDC”), Polán (“POL”), and Menasalbas (“MEN”), which are located on the Central Plateau of Spain up to 300 km distant from Las Rozas (Figures 1A and 1B). Thus, Ct appears to be a widely distributed endophyte among A. thaliana populations in Spain. In contrast, we failed to detect Ct in three A. thaliana populations in Germany and France (Figure S1B), suggesting an endemic association of the fungus with natural A. thaliana populations in the Central Plateau of Spain.Figure S1Distribution of C. tofieldiae at Different Seasons and at Various Sites in Europe, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Distribution of C. tofieldiae (Ct) from A. thaliana growing in the Las Rozas (LRO) site in central Spain at two different seasons of the year (April/May, and November). q-PCR analysis using Ct-specific primers detected the presence of Ct in plants at both seasons.(B) Ct was not detectable in soil and root samples from three A. thaliana populations in France (Saint-Dié des Vosges) and Germany (Geyen and Pulheim).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Distribution of C. tofieldiae (Ct) from A. thaliana growing in the Las Rozas (LRO) site in central Spain at two different seasons of the year (April/May, and November). q-PCR analysis using Ct-specific primers detected the presence of Ct in plants at both seasons. (B) Ct was not detectable in soil and root samples from three A. thaliana populations in France (Saint-Dié des Vosges) and Germany (Geyen and Pulheim). To visualize the infection process of Ct by live-cell confocal imaging, we first generated transgenic fungal strains constitutively expressing cytoplasmic GFP (Ct-GFP) by means of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Conidia of the transgenic strains were then inoculated onto leaves and roots of A. thaliana accession Col-0. On intact leaf surfaces, Ct spores germinated to form melanized appressoria at 8 dpi (Figure 2A). These are specialized infection structures essential for initial host cell entry by pathogenic Colletotrichum species (Deising et al., 2000Deising H.B. Werner S. Wernitz M. The role of fungal appressoria in plant infection.Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1631-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, although Ct was originally isolated from A. thaliana leaves (García et al., 2013García E. Alonso A. Platas G. Sacristan S. The endophytic mycobiota of Arabidopsis thaliana.Fungal Divers. 2013; 60: 71-89Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), fungal germlings were never seen to enter leaf epidermal cells and form invasive hyphae, even after 8 days. This suggests either that Ct does not use appressoria to invade A. thaliana leaves or that appressorium-mediated entry is terminated by the host. Next, we traced the infection of A. thaliana roots by Ct-GFP using transgenic plants expressing the aquaporin PIP2A fused with the fluorescent protein mCherry, providing a plasma membrane/ER marker for living host cells (Nelson et al., 2007Nelson B.K. Cai X. Nebenführ A. A multicolored set of in vivo organelle markers for co-localization studies in Arabidopsis and other plants.Plant J. 2007; 51: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Ct spores germinated at 6 hpi, producing either one or two germ-tubes that became branched (Figure 2B). Around 24 hpi, Ct hyphae were observed to directly enter root epidermal cells, producing intracellular hyphae that were enveloped by mCherry labeling (Figures 2C and 2D), suggesting the host plasma membrane invaginates around the hyphae and that the fungus establishes a biotrophic interaction with living host cells. However, the mCherry fluorescence disappeared from epidermal cells soon after penetration, indicating a loss of viability, although adjacent more recently colonized cells remained alive (Figures 2E–2G). The initial biotrophic interaction of intracellular hyphae with root epidermal cells was therefore transient. Ct also invaded roots via junctions between epidermal cells to form intercellular hyphae (Figures 2H and 2I). Whether penetrating directly into or between epidermal cells, fungal entry was by means of undifferentiated hyphae rather than appressoria, in striking contrast to Colletotrichum species infecting leaves (Deising et al., 2000Deising H.B. Werner S. Wernitz M. The role of fungal appressoria in plant infection.Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1631-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Following invasion of the root epidermis, Ct colonized the underlying cortex by means of both intra- and intercellular hyphae at 2 dpi (Figures 2J–2M, S2A, and S2B). Importantly, the intracellular hyphae in cortical cells remained enveloped by an intact host plasma membrane for longer periods than those infecting epidermal cells (Figures 2L and 2M), suggesting a more stable biotrophic interaction is established with cortical cells. By 8 dpi, extensive networks of extraradical hyphae enveloped the roots (Figures 2N, 2O, and S2A), while in some localized areas, epidermal and cortical cells became packed with black microsclerotia, comprising clusters of swollen, spherical cells with thick, melanized walls (Figures 2N–2P and S2B). In other root-infecting Colletotrichum species, microsclerotia can act as resting structures for long-term survival in soil (Blakeman and Hornby, 1966Blakeman J.P. Hornby D. The persistence of Colletotrichum coccodes and Mycosphaerella ligulicola in soil with special reference to sclerotia and conidia.Trans. Br. Mycol. Soc. 1966; 49: 227-240Crossref Google Scholar). TEM revealed that some hyphae colonized the endodermis, but most failed to penetrate the suberized cell walls of the periderm (Figures S2C–S2E). Nevertheless, straight runner hyphae were occasionally seen growing inside the central cylinder parallel to the long axis of the root (Figure 2Q). This shows that some hyphae do overcome the periderm barrier and raises the possibility that Ct colonizes above-ground parts of the plant via the root central cylinder, as reported for Magnaporthe oryzae on rice (Sesma and Osbourn, 2004Sesma A. Osbourn A.E. The rice leaf blast pathogen undergoes developmental processes typical of root-infecting fungi.Nature. 2004; 431: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and C. graminicola on maize (Sukno et al., 2008Sukno S.A. García V.M. Shaw B.D. Thon M.R. Root infection and systemic colonization of maize by Colletotrichum graminicola.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To test this, we grew Arabidopsis plants in a hydroponic culture system in which roots and shoots were physically separated (Strehmel et al., 2014Strehmel N. Böttcher C. Schmidt S. Scheel D. Profiling of secondary metabolites in root exudates of Arabidopsis thaliana.Phytochemistry. 2014; 108: 35-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inoculated the roots with conidia of Ct-GFP. Using RT-qPCR with GFP-specific primers, we detected the presence of the fungus in 11% of healthy leaves at 28 days after inoculation, increasing to 43% at 38 dpi (Figure S2F). Microscopic analysis at 28 dpi confirmed the presence of hyphae expressing GFP in healthy leaves, mostly restricted to leaf veins (Figure S2G). However, when leaves began to senesce at 48 dpi, the entire leaf was extensively colonized by mycelium, suggesting that Ct growth is limited until host tissues senesce (Figure S2H). Overall, these data suggest that Ct is a root endophyte on A. thaliana, which can also infect shoots systemically, without causing discernible disease symptoms. To address the long-term impacts of Ct colonization on plant growth, we co-cultivated A. thaliana plants with Ct in vermiculite, a naturally occurring mica mineral, without supplying additional nutrients. After 30 days, mock-treated plants appeared stunted and accumulated anthocyanin in their shoots, a well-known abiotic stress response in Arabidopsis (Kovinich et al., 2014Kovinich N. Kayanja G. Chanoca A. Riedl K. Otegui M.S. Grotewold E. Not all anthocyanins are born equal: distinct patterns induced by stress in Arabidopsis.Planta. 2014; 240: 931-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, plants co-cultivated with Ct had larger shoots that did not accumulate anthocyanins (Figure S3A), suggesting the fungus can promote plant growth in this low-nutrient soil-free system. We also measured silique production as an index of fertility and plant fitness. The Ct-treated plants produced significantly more siliques (Figure 3A), indicating that the fungus enhances both plant growth and fitness under low nutrient conditions.Figure 3C. tofieldiae Promotes Plant Growth in Low Phosphate ConditionsShow full caption(A) Number of siliques produced by A. thaliana growing in vermiculite.

See also Figure S3. To address whether Ct helps plants to assimilate nutrients, we used an agarose gel-based medium in which the concentration of specific nutrients, such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and iron, can be tightly controlled (Gruber et al., 2013Gruber B.D. Giehl R.F. Friedel S. von Wirén N. Plasticity of the Arabidopsis root system under nutrient deficiencies.Plant Physiol. 2013; 163: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In this system, we found that Ct promoted plant growth under low Pi conditions (50 μM bioavailable KH2PO4). Thus, after 18 days co-cultivation with Ct, plants developed longer roots and larger shoots, as measured by shoot fresh-weight, whereas plants co-cultivated with heat-killed fungus showed no growth promotion (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3B). Moreover, Ct also promoted plant growth when plant-inaccessible hydroxyapatite provided the sole Pi source, indicating that the fungus can dissolve this insoluble form of phosphate (Figure S3C). However, Ct did not promote plant growth under Pi-sufficient conditions (625 μM KH2PO4; Figure 3C), suggesting that a beneficial interaction with plants is established under Pi deficiency. We also tested the plant growth promotion ability of a closely related Colletotrichum species pathogenic on Raphanus sativus that was previously reported as C. dematium (Sato et al., 2005Sato T. Muta T. Imamura Y. Nojima H. Moriwaki J. Yaguchi Y. Anthracnose of Japanese radish caused by Colletotrichum dematium.J. Gen. Plant Pathol. 2005; 71: 380-383Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar), but now identified as C. incanum (Ci) (Hacquard et al., 2016Hacquard S. Kracher B. Hiruma K. Münch P.C. Garrido-Oter R. Weimann A. Thon M.R. Damm U. Dallery J.F. Hainaut M. et al.Survival trade-offs in plant roots during colonization by closely related beneficial and pathogenic fungi.Nat. Commun. 2016; (Published online April 15, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11362Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Remarkably, inoculation of Arabidopsis roots with Ci significantly inhibited plant growth under low Pi conditions (Figure 3C). The improved shoot growth provided by Ct under Pi-deficient conditions correlated with a significantly higher P concentration in shoot tissues, as measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Figure S3D), suggesting Ct enhances plant growth by improving Pi uptake from media. The hyphae of AM fungi are known to capture Pi from the soil outside the rhizosphere and translocate it into the plant (Bucher, 2007Bucher M. Functional biology of plant phosphate uptake at root and mycorrhiza interfaces.New Phytol. 2007; 173: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To study phosphate transport by Ct to distant plant roots and subsequent allocation to the shoot, we used a two-compartment system with the radioactive tracer 33P-phosphate added to one compartment (Figures 3D and S3E). To prevent 33P diffusion through the medium, plants and 33P were separated by a plastic barrier, which could only be bridged by fungal hyphae. 33P accumulation in shoots under Pi-starvation was analyzed in mock-inoculated plants and plants colonized by beneficial Ct or pathogenic Ci at 17 days after 33P addition to the inner compartment. Mock-inoculated plants (with 33P, but without fungus) accumulated <5 kBq/g dry weight (DW) 33P in their shoots (Figure 3D, mock). By contrast, 29 out of 37 plants colonized by Ct accumulated 33P in their shoots to higher levels than mock-inoculated plants (Figure 3D, Ct). 33P accumulation differed markedly between replicate Ct-inoculated plants, ranging from moderate (>5 to <40 kBq/g DW) to high levels (>40 up to 160 kBq/g DW). In contrast, although most shoots of plants colonized by the pathogenic Ci accumulated more 33P than mock-inoculated controls, the translocated 33P levels were dramatically lower (<10 kBq/g DW in 30 of 36 plants) compared to Ct-infected plants (Figure 3D, Ci). Remarkably, most plants colonized by Ct under Pi-replete conditions also did not accumulate more 33P than the corresponding mock control plants (Figure 3D), which might explain why Ct-mediated plant growth promotion was detectable only under Pi-deficient conditions (Figure 3C). Collectively, these results indicate that the transfer of 33P from Ct hyphae to the shoots of host plants is strictly regulated by Pi availability. To investigate the mechanism(s) by which Ct promotes plant growth, we collected samples for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis from infected A. thaliana roots grown under Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions at four time points (6, 10, 16, and 24 dpi) and also Ct hyphae grown in vitro. We focused our analysis on fungal and A. thaliana genes that were differentially expressed in Pi-deficient versus Pi-sufficient conditions (log2FC >1, false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05). Among the top 100 A. thaliana genes that were differentially expressed at 24 dpi under Pi-starvation, nine were related to “cellular response to phosphate starvation,” validating that the host reprograms its transcriptome in response to Pi deficiency (Figure S4A). These included genes belonging to the Pht1 family of plasma membrane phosphate:H+ symporters, some of which were shown to be required for Pi uptake from the rhizosphere (Shin et al., 2004Shin H. Shin H.S. Dewbre G.R. Harrison M.J.

Nine of these transporter genes were significantly upregulated in phosphate-starved roots in the absence of Ct while two, Pht1;2 and Pht1;3, were induced at higher levels only in the presence of Ct und"
https://openalex.org/W2299638516,"RNA-programmed genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes has enabled rapid and accessible alteration of specific genomic loci in many organisms. A flexible means to target RNA would allow alteration and imaging of endogenous RNA transcripts analogous to CRISPR/Cas-based genomic tools, but most RNA targeting methods rely on incorporation of exogenous tags. Here, we demonstrate that nuclease-inactive S. pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 can bind RNA in a nucleic-acid-programmed manner and allow endogenous RNA tracking in living cells. We show that nuclear-localized RNA-targeting Cas9 (RCas9) is exported to the cytoplasm only in the presence of sgRNAs targeting mRNA and observe accumulation of ACTB, CCNA2, and TFRC mRNAs in RNA granules that correlate with fluorescence in situ hybridization. We also demonstrate time-resolved measurements of ACTB mRNA trafficking to stress granules. Our results establish RCas9 as a means to track RNA in living cells in a programmable manner without genetically encoded tags."
https://openalex.org/W2303475965,"Almost all genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can be found in the general population, but the effects of this risk are unclear in people not ascertained for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Using several large ASD consortium and population-based resources (total n > 38,000), we find genome-wide genetic links between ASDs and typical variation in social behavior and adaptive functioning. This finding is evidenced through both LD score correlation and de novo variant analysis, indicating that multiple types of genetic risk for ASDs influence a continuum of behavioral and developmental traits, the severe tail of which can result in diagnosis with an ASD or other neuropsychiatric disorder. A continuum model should inform the design and interpretation of studies of neuropsychiatric disease biology."

As an example, the divergent lncRNA Evx1as promotes transcription of its neighbor gene, EVX1, and regulates mesendodermal differentiation. At a single-cell level, early broad expression of Evx1as is followed by a rapid, high-level transcription of EVX1, supporting the idea that Evx1as plays an upstream role to facilitate EVX1 transcription. Mechanistically, Evx1as RNA binds to regulatory sites on chromatin, promotes an active chromatin state, and interacts with Mediator. Based on our analyses, we propose that the biological function of thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs of this class may be inferred from the role of their neighboring adjacent genes."

This study aimed to investigate the presence of Cdr1as/miR-7a pathway in cardiomyocytes, and explore the mechanism underlying the function of miR-7a in protecting against myocardial infarction (MI)-induced apoptosis.Mouse MI injury model was established and evaluated by infarct size determination. Real-time PCR was performed to quantify the expression of Cdr1as and miR-7a in cardiomyocytes. Cell apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 activity analysis and flow cytometry assays with Annexin V/PI staining. Transfection of Cdr1as overexpressing plasmid and miR-7a mimic were conducted for gain-of-function studies. Luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis were performed to verity potential miR-7a targets.Cdr1as and miR-7a were both upregulated in MI mice with increased cardiac infarct size, or cardiomyocytes under hypoxia treatment. Cdr1as overexpression in MCM cells promoted cell apoptosis, but was then reversed by miR-7a overexpression. The SP1 was identified as a new miR-7a target, in line with previously identified PARP, while miR-7a-induced decrease of cell apoptosis under hypoxia treatment was proven to be inhibited by PARP-SP1 overexpression. Moreover, Cdr1as overexpression in vivo increased cardiac infarct size with upregulated expression of PARP and SP1, while miR-7a overexpression reversed these changes.Cdr1as also functioned as a powerful miR-7a sponge in myocardial cells, and showed regulation on the protective role of miR-7a in MI injury, involving the function of miR-7a targets, PARP and SP1."

To investigate poly(GA) toxicity, we generated mice that exhibit poly(GA) pathology, neurodegeneration and behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of FTD and ALS. These phenotypes occurred in the absence of TDP-43 pathology and required poly(GA) aggregation. HR23 proteins involved in proteasomal degradation and proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport were sequestered by poly(GA) in these mice. HR23A and HR23B similarly colocalized to poly(GA) inclusions in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Sequestration was accompanied by an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and decreased xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) levels in mice, indicative of HR23A and HR23B dysfunction. Restoring HR23B levels attenuated poly(GA) aggregation and rescued poly(GA)-induced toxicity in neuronal cultures. These data demonstrate that sequestration and impairment of nuclear HR23 and nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins is an outcome of, and a contributor to, poly(GA) pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2301435817,"Homeostatic mechanisms stabilize neural circuit function by keeping firing rates within a set-point range, but whether this process is gated by brain state is unknown. Here, we monitored firing rate homeostasis in individual visual cortical neurons in freely behaving rats as they cycled between sleep and wake states. When neuronal firing rates were perturbed by visual deprivation, they gradually returned to a precise, cell-autonomous set point during periods of active wake, with lengthening of the wake period enhancing firing rate rebound. Unexpectedly, this resetting of neuronal firing was suppressed during sleep. This raises the possibility that memory consolidation or other sleep-dependent processes are vulnerable to interference from homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. PAPERCLIP."
https://openalex.org/W2307551625,"Chronic liver damage leads to pathological accumulation of ECM proteins (liver fibrosis). Comprehensive characterization of the human ECM molecular composition is essential for gaining insights into the mechanisms of liver disease. To date, studies of ECM remodeling in human liver diseases have been hampered by the unavailability of purified ECM. Here, we developed a decellularization method to purify ECM scaffolds from human liver tissues. Histological and electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that the ECM scaffolds, devoid of plasma and cellular components, preserved the three-dimensional ECM structure and zonal distribution of ECM components. This method has been then applied on 57 liver biopsies of HCV-infected patients at different stages of liver fibrosis according to METAVIR classification. Label-free nLC-MS/MS proteomics and computation biology were performed to analyze the ECM molecular composition in liver fibrosis progression, thus unveiling protein expression signatures specific for the HCV-related liver fibrotic stages. In particular, the ECM molecular composition of liver fibrosis was found to involve dynamic changes in matrix stiffness, flexibility and density related to the dysregulation of predominant collagen, elastic fibers and minor components with both structural and signaling properties. This study contributes to the understanding of the molecular bases underlying ECM remodeling in liver fibrosis and suggests new molecular targets for fibrolytic strategies."

We tested HIV-1-specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs) as a post-exposure therapy in an infant macaque model for intrapartum MTCT. One-month-old rhesus macaques were inoculated orally with the simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIVSF162P3. On days 1, 4, 7 and 10 after virus exposure, we injected animals subcutaneously with NmAbs and quantified systemic distribution of NmAbs in multiple tissues within 24 h after antibody administration. Replicating virus was found in multiple tissues by day 1 in animals that were not treated. All NmAb-treated macaques were free of virus in blood and tissues at 6 months after exposure. We detected no anti-SHIV T cell responses in blood or tissues at necropsy, and no virus emerged after CD8(+) T cell depletion. These results suggest that early passive immunotherapy can eliminate early viral foci and thereby prevent the establishment of viral reservoirs."
https://openalex.org/W2298872905,"Hematopoiesis is regulated by crosstalk between long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and supporting niche cells in the bone marrow (BM). Here, we examine the role of CD82/KAI1 in niche-mediated LT-HSC maintenance. We found that CD82/KAI1 is expressed predominantly on LT-HSCs and rarely on other hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). In Cd82(-/-) mice, LT-HSCs were selectively lost as they exited from quiescence and differentiated. Mechanistically, CD82-based TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling leads to induction of CDK inhibitors and cell-cycle inhibition. The CD82 binding partner DARC/CD234 is expressed on macrophages and stabilizes CD82 on LT-HSCs, promoting their quiescence. When DARC(+) BM macrophages were ablated, the level of surface CD82 on LT-HSCs decreased, leading to cell-cycle entry, proliferation, and differentiation. A similar interaction appears to be relevant for human HSPCs. Thus, CD82 is a functional surface marker of LT-HSCs that maintains quiescence through interaction with DARC-expressing macrophages in the BM stem cell niche."

Genetic variation in Xrcc4 and Glis3 alters the response of NOD beta cells to unfolded protein stress, enhancing the apoptotic and senescent fates. The same transcriptional relationships were observed in human islets, demonstrating the role of beta cell fragility in genetic predisposition to diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2309730957,"An ecosystem service is a benefit derived by humanity that can be traced back to an ecological process. Although ecosystem services related to surface water have been thoroughly described, the relationship between atmospheric water and ecosystem services has been mostly neglected, and perhaps misunderstood. Recent advances in land-atmosphere modeling have revealed the importance of terrestrial ecosystems for moisture recycling. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which vegetation sustains the supply of atmospheric moisture and precipitation for downwind beneficiaries, globally. We simulate land-surface evaporation with a global hydrology model and track changes to moisture recycling using an atmospheric moisture budget model, and we define vegetation-regulated moisture recycling as the difference in moisture recycling between current vegetation and a hypothetical desert world. Our results show that nearly a fifth of annual average precipitation falling on land is from vegetation-regulated moisture recycling, but the global variability is large, with many places receiving nearly half their precipitation from this ecosystem service. The largest potential impacts for changes to this ecosystem service are land-use changes across temperate regions in North America and Russia. Likewise, in semi-arid regions reliant on rainfed agricultural production, land-use change that even modestly reduces evaporation and subsequent precipitation, could significantly affect human well-being. We also present a regional case study in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, where we identify the specific moisture recycling ecosystem services associated with the vegetation in Mato Grosso. We find that Mato Grosso vegetation regulates some internal precipitation, with a diffuse region of benefit downwind, primarily to the south and east, including the La Plata River basin and the megacities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. We synthesize our global and regional results into a generalized framework for describing moisture recycling as an ecosystem service. We conclude that future work ought to disentangle whether and how this vegetation-regulated moisture recycling interacts with other ecosystem services, so that trade-offs can be assessed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner."
https://openalex.org/W2297269161,"Control of plasma glucose level is essential to organismal survival. Sustained inflammation has been implicated in control of glucose homeostasis in cases of infection, obesity, and type 2 diabetes; however, the precise role of inflammation in these complex disease states remains poorly understood. Here, we find that sustained inflammation results in elevated plasma glucose due to increased hepatic glucose production. We find that sustained inflammation suppresses CYP7A1, leading to accumulation of intermediate metabolites at the branch point of the mevalonate pathway. This results in prenylation of RHOC, which is concomitantly induced by inflammatory cytokines. Subsequent activation of RHO-associated protein kinase results in elevated plasma glucose. These findings uncover an unexpected mechanism by which sustained inflammation alters glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2301244061,"Gene expression-based classification systems have identified an aggressive colon cancer subtype with mesenchymal features, possibly reflecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells. However, stromal fibroblasts contribute extensively to the mesenchymal phenotype of aggressive colon tumors, challenging the notion of tumor EMT. To separately study the neoplastic and stromal compartments of colon tumors, we have generated a stroma gene filter (SGF). Comparative analysis of stromahigh and stromalow tumors shows that the neoplastic cells in stromahigh tumors express specific EMT drivers (ZEB2, TWIST1, TWIST2) and that 98% of differentially expressed genes are strongly correlated with them. Analysis of differential gene expression between mesenchymal and epithelial cancer cell lines revealed that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), a transcriptional activator of intestinal (epithelial) differentiation, and its target genes are highly expressed in epithelial cancer cell lines. However, mesenchymal-type cancer cell lines expressed only part of the mesenchymal genes expressed by tumor-derived neoplastic cells, suggesting that external cues were lacking. We found that collagen-I dominates the extracellular matrix in aggressive colon cancer. Mimicking the tumor microenvironment by replacing laminin-rich Matrigel with collagen-I was sufficient to induce tumor-specific mesenchymal gene expression, suppression of HNF4α and its target genes, and collective tumor cell invasion of patient-derived colon tumor organoids. The data connect collagen-rich stroma to mesenchymal gene expression in neoplastic cells and to collective tumor cell invasion. Targeting the tumor-collagen interface may therefore be explored as a novel strategy in the treatment of aggressive colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2309553472,"Antibiotic resistance is an increasingly serious public health threat. Understanding pathways allowing bacteria to survive antibiotic stress may unveil new therapeutic targets. We explore the role of the bacterial epigenome in antibiotic stress survival using classical genetic tools and single-molecule real-time sequencing to characterize genomic methylation kinetics. We find that Escherichia coli survival under antibiotic pressure is severely compromised without adenine methylation at GATC sites. Although the adenine methylome remains stable during drug stress, without GATC methylation, methyl-dependent mismatch repair (MMR) is deleterious and, fueled by the drug-induced error-prone polymerase Pol IV, overwhelms cells with toxic DNA breaks. In multiple E. coli strains, including pathogenic and drug-resistant clinical isolates, DNA adenine methyltransferase deficiency potentiates antibiotics from the β-lactam and quinolone classes. This work indicates that the GATC methylome provides structural support for bacterial survival during antibiotic stress and suggests targeting bacterial DNA methylation as a viable approach to enhancing antibiotic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2309515914,"Cancer invasion is a hallmark of metastasis. The mesenchymal mode of cancer cell invasion is mediated by elongated membrane protrusions driven by the assembly of branched F-actin networks. How deregulation of actin regulators promotes cancer cell invasion is still enigmatic. We report that increased expression and membrane localization of the actin regulator Lamellipodin correlate with reduced metastasis-free survival and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. In agreement, we find that Lamellipodin depletion reduced lung metastasis in an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model. Invasive 3D cancer cell migration as well as invadopodia formation and matrix degradation was impaired upon Lamellipodin depletion. Mechanistically, we show that Lamellipodin promotes invasive 3D cancer cell migration via both actin-elongating Ena/VASP proteins and the Scar/WAVE complex, which stimulates actin branching. In contrast, Lamellipodin interaction with Scar/WAVE but not with Ena/VASP is required for random 2D cell migration. We identified a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism that regulates selective recruitment of these effectors to Lamellipodin: Abl-mediated Lamellipodin phosphorylation promotes its association with both Scar/WAVE and Ena/VASP, whereas Src-dependent phosphorylation enhances binding to Scar/WAVE but not to Ena/VASP. Through these selective, regulated interactions Lamellipodin mediates directional sensing of epidermal growth factor (EGF) gradients and invasive 3D migration of breast cancer cells. Our findings imply that increased Lamellipodin levels enhance Ena/VASP and Scar/WAVE activities at the plasma membrane to promote 3D invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2304215759,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a neoplasm of the sympathetic nervous system, and is the most common solid tumor of infancy. NBs are very heterogeneous, with a clinical course ranging from spontaneous regression to resistance to all current forms of treatment. High-risk patients need intense chemotherapy, and only 30–40% will be cured. Relapsed or metastatic tumors acquire multi-drug resistance, raising the need for alternative treatments. Owing to the diverse mechanisms that are responsible of NB chemoresistance, we aimed to target epigenetic factors that control multiple pathways to bypass therapy resistance. We found that the SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4 (SMARCA4/BRG1) was consistently upregulated in advanced stages of NB, with high BRG1 levels being indicative of poor outcome. Loss-of-function experiments in vitro and in vivo showed that BRG1 is essential for the proliferation of NB cells. Furthermore, whole-genome transcriptome analysis revealed that BRG1 controls the expression of key elements of oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/AKT and BCL2, which offers a promising new combination therapy for high-risk NB."

Clinical data, treatment, and patient mortality were evaluated. The following methods were used: MIC, PCRs, and outer membrane protein (OMP) analysis. Synergy was investigated using the checkerboard and time-kill methods. Clonality was evaluated by PFGE. Based on clonality, the whole genome sequence of six A. baumannii isolates was analyzed. All isolates were resistant to meropenem, rifampicin, and fosfomycin. OXA-23 and OXA-143 were the most frequent carbapenemases found. Four isolates showed loss of a 43kDa OMP. The colistin-susceptible isolates belonged to different clones and showed the highest synergistic effect with fosfomycin-amikacin. Among colistin-resistant isolates, the highest synergistic effect was observed with the combinations of colistin-rifampicin followed by colistin-vancomycin. All colistin-resistant isolates harbored blaOXA-23-like and belonged to CC113. Clinical and demographic data were available for 18 of 20 patients. Fourteen received treatment and eight patients died during treatment. The most frequent site of infection was the blood in 13 of 14 patients. Seven patients received vancomycin plus an active drug against A. baumannii; however, mortality did not differ in this group. The synergistic effect was similar for colistin-susceptible isolates of distinct clonal origin presenting with the same resistance mechanism. Overall mortality and death during treatment was high, and despite the high synergism in vitro with vancomycin, death did not differ comparing the use or not of vancomycin plus an active drug against A. baumannii."

https://openalex.org/W2300993775,"The interconversion between naive and primed pluripotent states is accompanied by drastic epigenetic rearrangements. However, it is unclear whether intrinsic epigenetic events can drive reprogramming to naive pluripotency or if distinct chromatin states are instead simply a reflection of discrete pluripotent states. Here, we show that blocking histone H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 activity with the small-molecule inhibitor MM-401 reprograms mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) to naive pluripotency. This reversion is highly efficient and synchronized, with more than 50% of treated EpiSCs exhibiting features of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) within 3 days. Reverted ESCs reactivate the silenced X chromosome and contribute to embryos following blastocyst injection, generating germline-competent chimeras. Importantly, blocking MLL1 leads to global redistribution of H3K4me1 at enhancers and represses lineage determinant factors and EpiSC markers, which indirectly regulate ESC transcription circuitry. These findings show that discrete perturbation of H3K4 methylation is sufficient to drive reprogramming to naive pluripotency."

The voltage-dependent Kv3.3 potassium channel is widely expressed in the nervous system and is prominent in auditory brainstem nuclei and cerebellum, where neurons fire at rates of several hundred Hz. In the cerebellar cortex, high Kv3.3 expression is found in Purkinje cells (Chang et al., 2007Chang S.Y. Zagha E. Kwon E.S. Ozaita A. Bobik M. Martone M.E. Ellisman M.H. Heintz N. Rudy B.

Like other members of the Kv3 subfamily, such as Kv3.1, Kv3.3 channels activate and deactivate rapidly in response to changes in transmembrane voltage (Rudy and McBain, 2001Rudy B. McBain C.J. Kv3 channels: voltage-gated K+ channels designed for high-frequency repetitive firing.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The major role of these delayed rectifier-type channels is to contribute to action potential repolarization. In response to sustained depolarization, Kv3.3 channels inactivate slowly over hundreds of milliseconds by an N-terminal ball-and-chain mechanism. This rate of inactivation can be further slowed by phosphorylation of two residues at the N terminus by protein kinase-C (Desai et al., 2008Desai R. Kronengold J. Mei J. Forman S.A. Kaczmarek L.K.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13) is a human autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the KCNC3 gene, which encodes the Kv3.3 channel. SCA13 patients have cerebellar atrophy and suffer motor symptoms (Waters et al., 2006Waters M.F. Minassian N.A. Stevanin G. Figueroa K.P. Bannister J.P. Nolte D. Mock A.F. Evidente V.G. Fee D.B.

Such mutations also severely impair localization of auditory stimuli (Middlebrooks et al., 2013Middlebrooks J.C. Nick H.S. Subramony S.H. Advincula J. Rosales R.L. Lee L.V. Ashizawa T. Waters M.F.

Some previously described Kv3.3 mutations that result in SCA13 are located in or close to transmembrane regions of the protein and suppress current either by altering channel gating or by acting as dominant negative subunits (Irie et al., 2014Irie T. Matsuzaki Y. Sekino Y. Hirai H. Kv3.3 channels harbouring a mutation of spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 alter excitability and induce cell death in cultured cerebellar Purkinje cells.J.

Genet. 2006; 38: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Although it is sometimes assumed that this disease is caused by the enhanced neuronal excitability resulting from suppression of potassium current, it is not clear why mutations in other channels that result in increased excitability and epileptic seizures are not associated with neurodegeneration and why no neurodegenerative disease mutations have been found in other Kv3 family channels that have similar physiological roles. This suggests that Kv3.3 may have additional cellular functions distinct from regulation of excitability (Lee et al., 2014Lee A. Fakler B. Kaczmarek L.K. Isom L.L. More than a pore: ion channel signaling complexes.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 15159-15169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The very large size of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of Kv3.3 distinguishes it from other Kv3 subfamily channels and suggests it has interactions with cytoplasmic signaling pathways and/or the cytoskeleton. We report that the Kv3.3 channel binds the anti-apoptotic protein Hax-1 to induce actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3)-dependent actin filament nucleation at the plasma membrane. The resulting cortical actin filament network regulates the inactivation of Kv3.3. We also describe a Kv3.3 mutation, G592R, that results in adult-onset SCA13. The G592R mutant is deficient in coordinating Arp2/3-dependent cortical actin assembly, resulting in neuronal growth cones with depleted actin veil structure. Within the large cytoplasmic C-terminal of the Kv3.3 channel lie strings of proline residues (…PPPPPPPHPHHGSGGISPPPP…) conserved in mouse and humans. As will be described later, a mutation in this region (G592R) is associated with late-onset SCA13, suggesting this region plays a critical functional role. Sequence comparisons show this region is similar to regions within neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family proteins (WASPs) and WASP family verprolin homologous (WAVE) proteins, which activate actin nucleation through Arp2/3 (Campellone and Welch, 2010Campellone K.G. Welch M.D. A nucleator arms race: cellular control of actin assembly.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). We first tested interactions of the channel with Arp2/3 by immunoblotting. Arp2/3 component Arp3 co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type Kv3.3 channels stably expressed in CHO cells (Figure 1A, left). Arp3, however, was not co-immunoprecipitated in cells stably expressing the G592R mutant channel, indicating the interaction of the mutant channel with Arp2/3 is either absent or much weaker than that of the wild-type channel (Figure 1A, right). To test whether the interaction of Kv3.3 with Arp2/3 influences actin nucleation, we carried out triple channel confocal imaging of actin filaments, Arp2/3, and the Kv3.3 channel in untransfected CHO cells and in cells transiently or stably expressing wild-type Kv3.3 (Figures 1B–1E and S1A). Kv3.3 was not expressed in untransfected CHO cells (Figure S1B); however, actin filaments were present in stress fibers within the cell body and in bundles along the cell periphery (Figure 1B, left panels, red and green arrowheads, respectively). In untransfected cells, Arp2/3 and actin filaments tended to colocalize in diffusely distributed puncta throughout the cell (Figure 1B). Introduction of Kv3.3 resulted in dramatic cell rounding accompanied by colocalization of actin filaments, Arp2/3, and Kv3.3 channels to a peripheral ring-like structure near the membrane-substrate interface (Figure 1D). Notably, stress fibers were absent or their presence severely reduced in the Kv3.3-expressing cells. Confocal Z sectioning was used to visualize the 3D distribution of actin filaments, Arp2/3, and Kv3.3 channels (cf. Movies S1, S2, and S3). It was evident that all three proteins were enriched in subplasmalemmal cortical regions. Figures 1C and 1E show confocal XZ projections, i.e., cellular cross sections, of respective protein distributions for untransfected and Kv3.3-expressing cells, respectively. In cells expressing Kv3.3, actin filaments and Arp2/3 were strikingly restricted to the cell cortex relative to untransfected cells (Figures 1C, 1E, and 1F). Kv3.3 channels strongly colocalized with both actin filaments and Arp2/3 (Figure 1E) (product of the differences from the mean [PDM] analysis indicated highest colocalization along the cortex, see Experimental Procedures). To further quantify Kv3.3 effects on cortical actin levels, we used label-free optical biosensors (the X-BODY Biosciences BIND system). This technique uses evanescent waves and resonant waveguide grating (RWG) optical biosensors to monitor changes in mass within the first ∼150 nm of the membrane surface in adherent cells (Cunningham et al., 2004Cunningham B.T. Li P. Schulz S. Lin B. Baird C. Gerstenmaier J. Genick C. Wang F. Fine E. Laing L. Label-free assays on the BIND system.J. Biomol.

RWG optical biosensors detect changes in the index of refraction resulting from a change in mass, such as the loss of membrane-associated actin filaments, within the detection zone of the biosensor (Fleming and Kaczmarek, 2009Fleming M.R.

Res. 2009; 29: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We first carried out control experiments to measure changes in mass produced by activation of an endogenous G protein-coupled receptor, or by direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Activation of the endogenous protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) with the pentapeptide agonist SFLLR (10 μM), produced an increase in mass near the biosensor. Similarly, activation of PKC by 100 nM TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate) produced an increase in signal, consistent with translocation of the enzyme to the plasma membrane. The amplitude of the SFLLR- and TPA-induced signal was identical in untransfected CHO cells and in those expressing Kv3.3 (Figure 1G). In contrast, application of 10 μM latrunculin B (LatB), which sequesters actin monomers and results in actin filament depolymerization, produced a decrease in mass; moreover, the decrease was significantly greater in Kv3.3-expressing cells (Figure 1G, p < 0.01). These results are consistent with a greater loss of actin filaments near the plasma membrane in Kv3.3-expressing cells. Patch clamp experiments were carried out in combination with a panel of pharmacological agents with well-characterized effects on actin dynamics to investigate how the cortical actin filaments affect Kv3.3 ion channel gating. Under control conditions, Kv3.3 currents undergo slow and only partial inactivation, declining over hundreds of milliseconds at positive membrane potentials (Desai et al., 2008Desai R. Kronengold J. Mei J. Forman S.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Protein kinase C modulates inactivation of Kv3.3 channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22283-22294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). LatB treatment resulted in a striking progressive increase in the rate of inactivation of wild-type Kv3.3 channels over tens of minutes. Because a steady state could not be reached during such recordings, we recorded Kv3.3-transfected CHO cells that were pretreated with 10 μM LatB for 1 hr before patch clamping. Under these conditions, the rate of inactivation was stable and very rapid, with a time constant of 25.97 ± 2.6 ms at +70 mV leading to near complete loss of current during 600-ms depolarizations (Figure 2A). To further quantify this effect, we measured the degree of inactivation that occurred within 100 ms of depolarization in the presence and absence of LatB (Figure 2C). LatB did not change the voltage-dependence of activation and its effects on rate of inactivation were concentration-dependent (Figures 2B and 2C). In parallel cell biological experiments, LatB treatment of Kv3.3-expressing cells was found to trigger a major loss of Arp2/3 from the cortical cytoskeleton, resulting in a 68% decrease in Arp3 cortical localization (Figures 2G and 2H). A smaller (47%) change was also measured in cortical F-actin localization. LatB treatment resulted in loss of the rounded cell shape and pronounced peripheral actin ring structures typical of CHO cells expressing wild-type Kv3.3 channels (Figure S2A, top versus middle panels). The peripheral ring-like localization of Arp2/3 was also disrupted. To further investigate the dynamic properties of the actin filaments involved in regulation of Kv3.3 channel gating, we treated cells with cytochalasin D (CD), which mainly inhibits actin monomer addition at barbed ends, thereby inhibiting rapid actin filament polymerization. Interestingly, CD (10 μM) had no effect on the rate of inactivation of Kv3.3 channels (Figures 2D and 2F) and had very little effect on cell shape (Figure S2A) or on the localization of Arp2/3 to the cortical cytoskeleton that underlies the plasma membrane (17% decrease; Figures 2G and 2H). CD also had only modest effects on cortical F-actin relative to LatB (27% versus 47% decreases for CD versus LatB, respectively). These results suggest that a relatively stable Arp2/3-dependent actin filament structure can regulate Kv3.3 channel inactivation. In support of this hypothesis, jasplakinolide, which stabilizes actin filaments, had no effect on Kv3.3 channel gating (Figures 2E and 2F). As is the case for several other potassium channels, inactivation of Kv3.3 channels occurs through an N-terminal “ball and chain” mechanism (Hoshi et al., 1990Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Biophysical and molecular mechanisms of Shaker potassium channel inactivation.Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After a channel opens, a “ball” comprised of residues at the very N terminus of the protein interacts with residues close to the pore of the channel, occluding further ion flux (Figure 3A). As a test for the specificity of action of LatB, we first tested its effects on the closely-related Kv3.1 channel (Kanemasa et al., 1995Kanemasa T. Gan L. Perney T.M. Wang L.Y. Kaczmarek L.K. Electrophysiological and pharmacological characterization of a mammalian Shaw channel expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Kv3.1 lacks an N-terminal inactivation ball and also has no WASP/WAVE-like sequence in its much shorter C-terminal domain. Kv3.1 undergoes little or no inactivation during 600-ms depolarization. LatB (10 μM) failed to produce rapid inactivation of Kv3.1 channels (Figures 3B and 3F). Moreover, expression of Kv3.1 in CHO cells failed to produce any change in cell shape. The overall pattern of actin and Arp3 staining was very similar to that of untransfected cells. The cortical enrichment of actin and Arp3 in Kv3.1-expressing cells was much lower than that in Kv3.3-expressing cells and indistinguishable from that of untransfected cells (Figures 3C, 3D, and S1A). LatB or CD treatment of Kv3.1-expressing cells resulted in similar disruptive effects on both cortical actin structure and Arp2/3 localization (Figures S3A–S3C). This is in sharp contrast with what was observed in Kv3.3-expressing cells (Figure 2H), where a CD-resistant cortical actin network was present and suggests Kv3.3 channels specifically promote generation of stable actin structures. To further test whether the rapid inactivation produced by LatB represents an increased rate of N-terminal inactivation, we applied 10 μM LatB to Kv3.3 channels lacking the N-terminal inactivation domain (ΔN1-78 Kv3.3). In the absence of LatB, these channels display no inactivation during depolarizations lasting 600 ms and, in the presence of LatB, inactivated only partially and very slowly (τ = 86.5 ± 6.2 ms, Figures 3E and 3F). This rate of inactivation was very significantly less than that of full length Kv3.3 in LatB (τ = 25.9 ± 2.8 ms). N-type inactivation of Kv3.3 is strongly attenuated by phosphorylation of two N-terminal serine residues by PKC (Desai et al., 2008Desai R. Kronengold J. Mei J. Forman S.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Protein kinase C modulates inactivation of Kv3.3 channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22283-22294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). Consistent with this, the inactivation of wild-type Kv3.3 channels treated with both LatB and the PKC activator TPA (100 nM) was slow and only partial, closely resembling that of ΔN1-78 Kv3.3 channels treated with LatB (Figures 3E and 3F). In contrast, treatment of cells with both LatB and TPA in the presence of the PKC inhibitor 1 μM Bis (bisindolylmaleimide) resulted in rapid and complete channel inactivation (τ = 22.34 ± 5.7; Figures 3E and 3F). Thus, at least in part, the very rapid inactivation produced by LatB in wild-type Kv3.3 requires the N-terminal inactivation ball. Given the strong delocalization of cortical Arp2/3 induced by LatB (Figures 2G and 2H) and coimmunoprecipitation of Arp2/3 and Kv3.3 (Figure 1A), we tested whether Arp2/3 could be specifically involved in regulation of Kv3.3 channel gating. To this end, the specific Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666 and its inactive analog CK689 were used (Nolen et al., 2009Nolen B.J. Tomasevic N. Russell A. Pierce D.W. Jia Z. McCormick C.D. Hartman J. Sakowicz R. Pollard T.D. Characterization of two classes of small molecule inhibitors of Arp2/3 complex.Nature. 2009; 460: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In voltage-clamp experiments, CK666 induced very rapid inactivation in wild-type Kv3.3 channels (τ = 28.49 ± 2.3 ms), while its inactive analog CK689 had no effect (Figures 4A and 4B ). In addition, CK666 had a much smaller effect on ΔN1-78 Kv3.3 channels that lack the N-terminal inactivation ball (Figure 4B). Like LatB, CK666 treatment resulted in a striking delocalization of Arp2/3 from the cell cortex of Kv3.3-expressing cells (Figures 4E and 4F, 63% decrease) and a more modest decrease in cortical F-actin (Figures 4E and 4F, 31% decrease). The inactive drug analog had no discernable effect on Arp2/3 localization or cortical actin structure (Figures 4E and 4F, CK689; Figure S2B). Arp2/3 inhibition resulted in disruption of peripheral lamellipodial structures, and in some cases, cells rounded up (Figure S2B). Finally, Arp2/3 inhibition in Kv3.1-expressing cells resulted in delocalization of the cortical Arp2/3 to a level similar to that observed after LatB or CD treatment (Figure S3C) and relative effects on cortical actin structures were modest when compared to those observed in Kv3.3-expressing cells. It is well known that Arp2/3 is regulated by actin nucleation promoting factors that are downstream of small GTPases Rac and/or CDC42 activity (Pollard, 2007Pollard T.D. Regulation of actin filament assembly by Arp2/3 complex and formins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 451-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). We found that Rac inhibition with EHT 1864 resulted in rapid inactivation of wild-type Kv3.3 channels (Figures 4C and 4D). In parallel cell biology experiments, Rac inhibition led to a 56% decrease in cortical Arp2/3 localization and a 44% decrease in cortical F-actin (Figures 4G and 4H). Rac inhibition mimicked the effects of Arp2/3 inhibition on peripheral lamellipodial structures and cells rounding up (cf. Figure S2B). In summary, these results suggest Arp2/3-dependent cortical actin structures that are produced by expression of Kv3.3 in the plasma membrane play a significant role in regulating the gating kinetics of these channels. Kv3.3 is highly expressed in many neurons of the auditory brainstem including the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) (Li et al., 2001Li W. Kaczmarek L.K. Perney T.M. Localization of two high-threshold potassium channel subunits in the rat central auditory system.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 437: 196-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Co-immunostaining for Kv3.3 and the presynaptic marker syntaxin of P14 mice reveals that Kv3.3 is predominantly localized to the large presynaptic calyces of Held that synapse onto the principal neurons of this nucleus (Figures S4A and S4B). No immunostaining was detected in neurons from Kv3.3−/− mice (data not shown). Patch clamp recordings were carried out on the calyces of P14 mice, and biotin was included in patch pipettes, allowing subsequent processing of slices to confirm that recordings had been made on presynaptic terminals (Figures S4C and S4D). The rate of inactivation of voltage-dependent potassium current was accelerated within 10 min of treatment with 20 μM LatB in calyces from wild-type animals (Figure S4C, n = 3) but not those from Kv3.3−/− animals (Figure S4D, n = 4). Moreover, an increase in inactivation in response to LatB was not detected in recordings of the somata of the postsynaptic principal neurons from either wild-type or Kv3.3−/− mice (Figures S4E and S4F, n = 3 and n = 3, respectively), although decreases in amplitude with no change in rate of inactivation were observed in some cases (Figure S4E). This is consistent with earlier observations that the major postsynaptic Kv3 family channel is Kv3.1 (Macica et al., 2003Macica C.M. von Hehn C.A. Wang L.Y. Ho C.S. Yokoyama S. Joho R.H. Kaczmarek L.K. Modulation of the kv3.1b potassium channel isoform adjusts the fidelity of the firing pattern of auditory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the linkage of Kv3.3 to the actin cytoskeleton we have characterized in transfected cells also occurs in native neurons. A G592R mutation within the proline-rich domain in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of Kv3.3 (…PPPPPPPHPHHGSG(G/R)GISPPPP…) results in adult-onset SCA13 (Figure 3A). To determine whether this mutation impairs Kv3.3 current, we first expressed both mouse and human G592R Kv3.3 channels in CHO cells and characterized currents by whole cell patch clamping. Current amplitude and voltage-dependence of the mutant channels were similar to those of the wild-type channels (Figures 5A and 5B ). Their rate of inactivation during maintained depolarization was, however, slower than that of the wild-type channels. For the mouse channels, we also determined the voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation by stepping the membrane potential from a 4-s prepulse at potentials between −70 to +20 mV to a test potential of +20 mV for 250 ms. This was identical for the wild-type and G592R channels (WT V1/2 = 10 mV ± 0.5 mV; G592R V1/2 = 10 ± 0.3 mV). Next, we compared cytoskeletal interactions of these mutant channels with those of the wild-type channels. As described earlier, in contrast to wild-type channels, G592R Kv3.3 channels do not co-immunoprecipitate with Arp2/3 (Figure 1A). Moreover, in the label-free biosensor assay, which measures changes in mass at the plasma membrane after treatment with 10 μM LatB (see Figure 1G), the decrease in mass near the biosensor following treatment of G592R Kv3.3 cells with LatB was not statistically different from that of untransfected cells (Figure S1D). This contrasts sharply with wild-type Kv3.3 channels and suggests that G592R Kv3.3 channels cannot efficiently recruit actin filaments to the plasma membrane. To investigate this suggestion further, we compared distributions of actin filaments, Arp2/3, and channels by confocal imaging in untransfected cells or cells expressing wild-type (cf. Figure 1) or G592R mutant Kv3.3 channels (Figures 5C and 5D). Actin filament and Arp2/3 distributions in cells expressing G592R Kv3.3 resembled untransfected cells (compare Figure 5C with Figures 1B and S1A). Classical stress fibers (Figure 5C, arrowhead) were clearly present and Arp2/3, actin filaments, and mutant Kv3.3 channels were present in puncta diffusely distributed in optical sections near the substrate-membrane interface. Neither G592R Kv3.3 channels nor Arp2/3 colocalized with stress fibers (Figure 5C, middle and bottom rows). Examination of cellular cross sections revealed a less robust patchy cortical actin structure accompanied by weaker Arp2/3 localization to the cell cortex in the mutant cells (Figures 5D and 5E). Quantitative colocalization analysis by intensity correlation quotient (ICQ) indicated that actin-Kv3.3 channel and Arp2/3-Kv3.3 channel colocalization were both significantly decreased in G592R mutants; in contrast, Arp2/3-actin filament interactions were not affected (Figure 5F). These results suggest the G592R mutation decreases the affinity of interactions between Kv3.3 channels and Arp2/3 with little effect on Arp2/3-actin filament interactions. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were carried out to test the response of both mouse and human G592R Kv3.3 channels to LatB. Although LatB increased inactivation of G592R Kv3.3 channels, the time constant was significantly longer than that of the wild-type channels in LatB. For the mouse wild-type and G592R channels, inactivation time constants in LatB (at +70 mV) were 25.97 ± 2.6 and 72.17 ± 3.7 ms, respectively (p = 0.0001, n = 4, 9). Similarly for human wild-type and G592R channels, time constants were 31.01 ± 3.4 and 83.26 ± 8.6 ms, respectively (p = 0.0015, n = 4, 4). Moreover, in contrast to the effect of LatB on wild-type channels, inactivation of G592R channels in the presence of LatB was only partial, with only ∼60% inactivation at the end of a 600-ms pulse to +70 mV (Figure S5A). To further quantify these differences, we compared the degree of inactivation that occurred within 100 ms of depolarization for the mouse and human channels in the presence and absence of LatB for both wild-type and mutant channels (Figures S5A–S5C). This parameter also confirmed that the mutant channels are relatively resistant to the actions of LatB. The slower pattern of inactivation of G592R Kv3.3 channels in the presence of LatB resembled that of wild-type channels missing the N-terminal inactivation ball (Figure 3E), or wild-type channels exposed to a PKC activator that prevents N-type inactivation (Figure 3E). To confirm the role of the proline-rich C-terminal domain in regulation of N-type inactivation, we tested two other C-terminal mutations, a deletion of the polyproline sequence before G592 (Δ578-588 Kv3.3) and a more extensive deletion of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (Δ571-769 Kv3.3) (Figures S3D–S3F). Both mutants resembled wild-type channels in that they inactivated only over several hundred milliseconds during depolarization. Like G592R Kv3.3, however, these two mutations inactivated more slowly and only partially after treatment with 10 μM LatB (Figures S3D–S3F). The G592R mutant channel was also relatively resistant to Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666 and the Rac inhibitor EHT 1864, compared to wild-type Kv3.3 channels (Figures S5D–S5G). As described earlier, CK666 (10 μM) induced rapid inactivation in wild-type channels (Figure 4A), but the degree of inactivation within 100 ms (Figures S5D and S5E) and time constant of inactivation were significantly slowed in CK666-treated G592R Kv3.3 channels (+70 mV: wild-type Kv3.3 τ = 28.5 ± 2.3 ms; G592R Kv3.3, τ = 62.3 ± 13.9 ms, p = 0.038). Similarly, the inactivation produced by the Rac inhibitor EHT 1864 was substantially reduced in G592R channels, compared to wild-type Kv3.3 channels (Figures S5F and S5G) (25 μM ETH 1864, +70 mV, wild-type"

SLOS results in cognitive impairment, behavioral abnormalities and nervous system defects, though neither affected cell types nor impaired signaling pathways are fully understood. Whether 7DHC accumulation or cholesterol loss is primarily responsible for disease pathogenesis is also unclear. Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from subjects with SLOS, we identified cellular defects that lead to precocious neuronal specification within SLOS derived neural progenitors. We also demonstrated that 7DHC accumulation, not cholesterol deficiency, is critical for SLOS-associated defects. We further identified downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a key initiator of aberrant SLOS iPSC differentiation through the direct inhibitory effects of 7DHC on the formation of an active Wnt receptor complex. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling prevented the neural phenotypes observed in SLOS iPSCs, suggesting that Wnt signaling may be a promising therapeutic target for SLOS."
https://openalex.org/W2313399607,"Purpose To visualize and quantify conventional outflow directly in its anatomic location. Methods We obtained fluorescein canalograms in six porcine whole eyes and six porcine anterior segment cultures. Eyes were perfused with a constant pressure of 15 mmHg using media containing 0.017 mg/ml fluorescein. Flow patterns were visualized using a stereo dissecting microscope equipped for fluorescent imaging. Images were captured every 30 seconds for 20 minutes for time lapse analysis. Anterior chamber cultures were imaged again on day three of culture. Canalograms were first analyzed for filling time per quadrant. We then wrote a program to automatically compute focal flow fits for each macropixel and to detect convergent perilimbal flow patterns with macropixels grouped into 3 equal-radial width rings around the cornea. A generalized additive model was used to determine fluorescence changes of individual macropixels. Results The resulting imaging algorithm deployed 1024 macropixels that were fit to determine maximum intensity and time to fill. These individual fits highlighted the focal flow function. In whole eyes, significantly faster flow was seen in the inferonasal (IN) and superonasal (SN) quadrants compared to the superotemporal (ST) and inferotemporal (IT) ones (p<0.05). In anterior chamber cultures, reduced flow on day 1 increased in all quadrants on day 3 except in IT (p<0.05). Perilimbal ring analysis uncovered convergent perilimbal flow. Conclusions An algorithm was developed that analyzes regional and circumferential outflow patterns. This algorithm found flow patterns that changed over time and differ in whole eyes and anterior segment cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2307714273,"Downregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is commonly observed in cancers and promotes tumorigenesis suggesting that miRNAs may function as tumor suppressors. However, the mechanism through which miRNAs are regulated in cancer, and the connection between oncogenes and miRNA biogenesis remain poorly understood. The TP53 tumor-suppressor gene is mutated in half of human cancers resulting in an oncogene with gain-of-function activities. Here we demonstrate that mutant p53 (mutp53) oncoproteins modulate the biogenesis of a subset of miRNAs in cancer cells inhibiting their post-transcriptional maturation. Interestingly, among these miRNAs several are also downregulated in human tumors. By confocal, co-immunoprecipitation and RNA-chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that endogenous mutp53 binds and sequesters RNA helicases p72/82 from the microprocessor complex, interfering with Drosha-pri-miRNAs association. In agreement with this, the overexpression of p72 leads to an increase of mature miRNAs levels. Moreover, functional experiments demonstrate the oncosuppressive role of mutp53-dependent miRNAs (miR-517a, −519a, −218, −105). Our study highlights a previously undescribed mechanism by which mutp53 interferes with Drosha-p72/82 association leading, at least in part, to miRNA deregulation observed in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2305717463,"Progestins have long been used clinically for the treatment of endometrial cancers; however, the response rates to progestin therapy vary and the molecular mechanisms behind progestin insensitivity are poorly understood. We hypothesized that in PTEN-mutated endometrial cancers, hyperactive Akt signaling downregulates progesterone receptor B (PRB) transcriptional activity, leading to overall impaired progestin responses. We report that inhibition of Akt with the Akt inhibitor, MK-2206 (MK), in conjunction with progestin (R5020) treatment, is sufficient to upregulate a subset of PRB target genes in Ishikawa cells stably expressing PRB (PRB-Ishikawa). Through gene ontology analysis of Akt-regulated PRB target genes, angiogenesis was found to be the principle process regulated by Akt-PRB. To further interrogate the mechanism by which Akt modulates PRB transcriptional activity, ChIP-Mass spectrometry was performed to identify potential cofactors that differentially interact with PRB in the presence of R5020 and MK+R5020. 14-3-3σ was identified as a protein enriched in the MK+R5020 data set, and it was demonstrated that 14-3-3σ is required for the upregulation in PRB target gene expression following inhibition of Akt. To determine the ramifications of MK+R5020 treatment on angiogenesis, in vitro assays were performed and combinatorial MK+R5020 treatment significantly decreased endothelial cell invasion and tube formation more than MK or R5020 treatment alone. Furthermore, we found that combinatorial MK-2206+progesterone treatments decreased angiogenesis and proliferation in the Ptend/d conditional mouse model of endometrial cancer. Taken together, these findings suggest that a combinatorial therapeutic approach utilizing Akt inhibitors with progestins may improve the efficacy of progestin therapy for the treatment of endometrial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2325422476,"Modulation of chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 has been implicated in attenuation of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic injury. In pulmonary fibrosis, published reports suggest that collagen production in the injured lung is derived from fibrocytes recruited from the circulation in response to release of pulmonary CXCL12. Conversely, in hepatic fibrosis, resident hepatic stellate cells (HSC), the key cell type in progression of fibrosis, upregulate CXCR4 expression in response to activation. Further, CXCL12 induces HSC proliferation and subsequent production of collagen I. In the current study, we evaluated AMD070, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of CXCL12/CXCR4 in alleviating BLM-induced pulmonary and CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice. Similar to other CXCR4 antagonists, treatment with AMD070 significantly increased leukocyte mobilization. However, in these two models of fibrosis, AMD070 had a negligible impact on extracellular matrix deposition. Interestingly, our results indicated that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has a role in improving mortality associated with BLM induced pulmonary injury, likely through dampening an early inflammatory response and/or vascular leakage. Together, these findings indicate that the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis is not an effective target for reducing fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2301785271,"Purpose Mesangial cells play an important role in regulating glomerular filtration by altering their cellular tone. We report the presence of a sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT) in rat mesangial cells. This study in rat mesangial cells aimed to evaluate the expression and role of SGLT2. Methods The SGLT2 expression in rat mesangial cells was assessed by Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Changes in the mesangial cell surface area at different glucose concentrations and the effects of extracellular Na+ and Ca2+ and of SGLT and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) inhibitors on cellular size were determined. The cellular sizes and the contractile response were examined during a 6-day incubation with high glucose with or without phlorizin, an SGLT inhibitor. Results Western blotting revealed an SGLT2 band, and RT-PCR analysis of SGLT2 revealed the predicted 422-bp band in both rat mesangial and renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. The cell surface area changed according to the extracellular glucose concentration. The glucose-induced contraction was abolished by the absence of either extracellular Na+ or Ca2+ and by SGLT and NCX inhibitors. Under the high glucose condition, the cell size decreased for 2 days and increased afterwards; these cells did not contract in response to angiotensin II, and the SGLT inhibitor restored the abolished contraction. Conclusions These data suggest that SGLT2 is expressed in rat mesangial cells, acts as a normal physiological glucose sensor and regulates cellular contractility in rat mesangial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2305154634,"Estrogen can modulate neuronal development and signalling by both genomic and non-genomic pathways. Many of its rapid, non-genomic effects on nervous tissue have been suggested to be mediated via the activation of the estrogen sensitive G-protein coupled receptor (GPER1 or GPR30). There has been much controversy over the cellular location, signalling properties and endogenous activators of GPER1. Here we describe the pharmacology and signalling properties of GPER1 in an immortalized embryonic hippocampal cell line, mHippoE-18. This cell line does not suffer from the inherent problems associated with the study of this receptor in native tissue or the problems associated with heterologously expression in clonal cell lines. In mHippoE-18 cells, 17β-Estradiol can mediate a dose-dependent rapid potentiation of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP levels but does not appear to activate the ERK1/2 pathway. The effect of 17β-Estradiol can be mimicked by the GPER1 agonist, G1, and also by tamoxifen and ICI 182,780 which activate GPER1 in a variety of other preparations. The response is not mimicked by the application of the classical estrogen receptor agonists, PPT, (an ERα agonist) or DPN, (an ERβ agonist), further suggesting that this effect of 17β-Estradiol is mediated through the activation of GPER1. However, after exposure of the cells to the GPER1 specific antagonists, G15 and G36, the stimulatory effects of the above agonists are replaced by dose-dependent inhibitions of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP levels. This inhibitory effect is mimicked by aldosterone in a dose-dependent way even in the absence of the GPER1 antagonists. The results are discussed in terms of possible ""Biased Antagonism"" whereby the antagonists change the conformation of the receptor resulting in changes in the agonist induced coupling of the receptor to different second messenger pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2318304207,"Staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1 (SND1) is overexpressed in multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and functions as an oncogene. This study was carried out to identify novel SND1-interacting proteins to better understand its molecular mechanism of action. SND1-interacting proteins were identified by a modified yeast two-hybrid assay. Protein-protein interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. MGLL-overexpressing clones were analyzed for cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis and in vivo tumorigenesis in nude mice. MGLL was identified as an SND1-interacting protein. Interaction of SND1 with MGLL resulted in ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of MGLL. MGLL expression was detected in normal human hepatocytes and mouse liver, although it was undetected in human HCC cell lines. An inverse correlation between SND1 and MGLL levels was identified in a human HCC tissue microarray as well as in the TCGA database. Forced overexpression of MGLL in human HCC cells resulted in marked inhibition in cell proliferation with a significant delay in cell cycle progression and a marked decrease in tumor growth in nude mouse xenograft assays. MGLL overexpression inhibited Akt activation that is independent of enzymatic activity of MGLL and overexpression of a constitutively active Akt rescued cells from inhibition of proliferation and restored normal cell cycle progression.

We have previously shown that miR-708 and miR-140-3p regulate the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways in human ASM (HASM) cells following TNF-α exposure. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effect of these miRNAs on other asthma-related genes. Microarray analysis using the Illumina platform was performed with total RNA extracted from miR-708 (or control miR)-transfected HASM cells. Inhibition of candidate inflammation-associated gene expression was further validated by qPCR and ELISA. The most significant biologic functions for the differentially expressed gene set included decreased inflammatory response, cytokine expression and signaling. qPCR revealed inhibition of expression of CCL11, CXCL10, CCL2 and CXCL8, while the release of CCL11 was inhibited in miR-708-transfected cells. Transfection of cells with miR-140-3p resulted in inhibition of expression of CCL11, CXCL12, CXCL10, CCL5 and CXCL8 and of TNF-α-induced CXCL12 release. In addition, expression of RARRES2, CD44 and ADAM33, genes known to contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma, were found to be inhibited in miR-708-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that miR-708 and miR-140-3p exert distinct effects on inflammation-associated gene expression and biological function of ASM cells. Targeting these miRNA networks may provide a novel therapeutic mechanism to down-regulate airway inflammation and ASM proliferation in asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2311369088,"A number of naturally occurring isoforms of the tumour suppressor protein p53 have been discovered, which appear to have differing roles in tumour prevention or promotion. We are investigating the tumour-promoting activities of the Δ133p53 isoform using our mouse model of Δ133p53 (Δ122p53). Here, we report that tumours from Δ122p53 homozygous mice show evidence of invasion and metastasis and that Δ122p53 promotes migration though a 3-dimensional collagen matrix. We also show that Δ122p53 and Δ133p53 promote cell migration in scratch wound and Transwell assays, similar to the ‘gain-of-function’ phenotypes seen with mutant p53. Using the well-defined B16 mouse melanoma metastatic model, we show that Δ122p53 leads to faster generation of lung metastases. The increased migratory phenotypes are dependent on secreted factors, including the cytokine interleukin-6 and the chemokine CCL2. We propose that Δ122p53 (and Δ133p53) acts in a similar manner to ‘gain-of-function’ mutant p53 proteins to promote migration, invasion and metastasis, which may contribute to poor survival in patients with Δ133p53-expressing tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2303094108,"C/EBPα (p42 and p30 isoforms) is commonly dysregulated in cancer via the action of oncogenes, and specifically in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) by mutation. Elevated TRIB2 leads to the degradation of C/EBPα p42, leaving p30 intact in AML. Whether this relationship is a cooperative event in AML transformation is not known and the molecular mechanism involved remains elusive. Using mouse genetics, our data reveal that in the complete absence of C/EBPα, TRIB2 was unable to induce AML. Only in the presence of C/EBPα p42 and p30, were TRIB2 and p30 able to cooperate to decrease the latency of disease. We demonstrate that the molecular mechanism involved in the degradation of C/EBPα p42 requires site-specific direct interaction between TRIB2 and C/EBPα p42 for the K48-specific ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of C/EBPα p42. This interaction and ubiquitination is dependent on a critical C terminal lysine residue on C/EBPα. We show effective targeting of this pathway pharmacologically using proteasome inhibitors in TRIB2-positive AML cells. Together, our data show that excess p30 cooperated with TRIB2 only in the presence of p42 to accelerate AML, and the direct interaction and degradation of C/EBPα p42 is required for TRIB2-mediated AML."
https://openalex.org/W2308084139,"The biodiversity of the Southern Balkans, part of the Mediterranean global biodiversity hot-spot, is threatened by land use intensification and abandonment, the latter causing forest encroachment of formerly open habitats. We investigated the impact of forest encroachment on butterfly species richness, community species composition and the representation of life history traits by repeated seasonal visits of 150 one-hectare sites in five separate regions in three countries—Greece, Bulgaria, and the Republic of Macedonia (FYROM—the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)— 10 replicates for each habitat type of grasslands, open formations and scrub forest within each region. Grasslands and open formations sites hosted in average more species and more red-listed species than scrub forest, while no pattern was found for numbers of Mediterranean species. As shown by ordination analyses, each of the three habitat types hosted distinct butterfly communities, with Mediterranean species inclining either towards grasslands or open formations. Analysing the representation of life history traits revealed that successional development from grasslands and open formations towards scrub forest shifts the community composition towards species overwintering in earlier stages, having fewer generations per year, and inhabiting large European or Eurosiberian (e.g. northern) ranges; it decreases the representation of Mediterranean endemics. The loss of grasslands and semi-open formations due to forest encroachment thus threatens exactly the species that should be the focus of conservation attention in the Mediterranean region, and innovative conservation actions to prevent ongoing forest encroachment are badly needed."
https://openalex.org/W2312129590,"Despite the burgeoning research on social entrepreneurship (SE), SE strategies remain poorly understood. Drawing on extant research on the social activism and social change, empowerment and SE models, we explore, classify and validate the strategies used by 2,334 social entrepreneurs affiliated with the world's largest SE support organization, Ashoka. The results of the topic modeling of the social entrepreneurs' strategy profiles reveal that they employed a total of 39 change-making strategies that vary across resources (material versus symbolic strategies), specificity (general versus specific strategies), and mode of participation (mass versus elite participation strategies); they also vary across fields of practice and time. Finally, we identify six meta-SE strategies-a reduction from the 39 strategies-and identify four new meta-SE strategies (i.e., system reform, physical capital development, evidence-based practices, and prototyping) that have been overlooked in prior SE research. Our findings extend and deepen the research into SE strategies and offer a comprehensive model of SE strategies that advances theory, practice and policy making."
https://openalex.org/W2311162865,"C. elegans will orient and travel in a straight uninterrupted path directly towards the negative pole of a DC electric field. We have sought to understand the strategy worms use to navigate to the negative pole in a uniform electric field that is fixed in both direction and magnitude. We examined this behavior by quantifying three aspects of electrotaxis behavior in response to different applied field strengths: the mean approach trajectory angles of the animals’ tracks, turning behavior (pirouettes) and average population speeds. We determined that C. elegans align directly to the negative pole of an electric field at sub-preferred field strength and alter approach trajectories at higher field strengths to maintain taxis within a preferred range we have calculated to be ~ 5V/cm. We sought to identify the sensory neurons responsible for the animals’ tracking to a preferred field strength. eat-4 mutant animals defective in glutamatergic signaling of the amphid sensory neurons are severely electrotaxis defective and ceh-36 mutant animals, which are defective in the terminal differentiation of two types of sensory neurons, AWC and ASE, are partially defective in electrotaxis. To further elucidate the role of the AWC neurons, we examined the role of each of the pair of AWC neurons (AWCOFF and AWCON), which are functionally asymmetric and express different genes. nsy-5/inx-19 mutant animals, which express both neurons as AWCOFF, are severely impaired in electrotaxis behavior while nsy-1 mutants, which express both neurons as AWCON, are able to differentiate field strengths required for navigation to a specific field strength within an electric field. We also tested a strain with targeted genetic ablation of AWC neurons and found that these animals showed only slight disruption of directionality and turning behavior. These results suggest a role for AWC neurons in which complete loss of function is less disruptive than loss of functional asymmetry in electrotaxis behavior within a uniform fixed field."
https://openalex.org/W2304481460,"Background We determined the generalisability and cost-impact of adopting antibiotic-impregnated CVCs in all paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in England, based on results from a large randomised controlled trial (the CATCH trial; ISRCTN34884569). Methods BSI rates using standard CVCs were estimated through linkage of national PICU audit data (PICANet) with laboratory surveillance data. We estimated the number of BSI averted if PICUs switched from standard to antibiotic-impregnated CVCs by applying the CATCH trial rate-ratio (0.40; 95% CI 0.17,0.97) to the BSI rate using standard CVCs. The value of healthcare resources made available by averting one BSI as estimated from the trial economic analysis was £10,975; 95% CI -£2,801,£24,751. Results The BSI rate using standard CVCs was 4.58 (95% CI 4.42,4.74) per 1000 CVC-days in 2012. Applying the rate-ratio gave 232 BSI averted using antibiotic CVCs. The additional cost of purchasing antibiotic-impregnated compared with standard CVCs was £36 for each child, corresponding to additional costs of £317,916 for an estimated 8831 CVCs required in PICUs in 2012. Based on 2012 BSI rates, management of BSI in PICUs cost £2.5 million annually (95% uncertainty interval: -£160,986, £5,603,005). The additional cost of antibiotic CVCs would be less than the value of resources associated with managing BSI in PICUs with standard BSI rates >1.2 per 1000 CVC-days. Conclusions The cost of introducing antibiotic-impregnated CVCs is less than the cost associated with managing BSIs occurring with standard CVCs. The long-term benefits of preventing BSI could mean that antibiotic CVCs are cost-effective even in PICUs with extremely low BSI rates."
https://openalex.org/W2308742658,"Implementation of the Charter to protect patients' rights is an important criterion to achieve patient-centered approach and receive financial support from the Global Fund. Our study aims to explore the knowledge of tuberculosis (TB) patients about their rights and responsibilities at the Chest Disease Unit of the Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur, Pakistan.This was a qualitative study. The data from purposefully selected TB patients was collected by in-depth interviews. Eligibility criteria included confirmed diagnosis of TB and enrollment in the TB program. A pilot tested interview protocol was based upon the objectives of the study, and was used uniformly in each interview to maintain the consistency. The sample size was limited by applying the saturation criteria. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic content analysis was applied to analyze the data and draw conclusions.Out of the total 16 patients, four were female, and seven were illiterate. Eight patients were known cases of multi-drug resistant TB. Analysis of the data yielded seven themes; tuberculosis care services, moral support and stigmatization, dignity and privacy, complaints, fear of losing job, information sharing and compliance to the treatment plan, and contribution to eradicate TB. First five represented the rights section while latter two were related to the responsibilities section of the Charter.Discriminatory access to TB care services and the right to privacy were two major concerns identified in this study. However, the respondents recognized their responsibilities as a TB patient. To ensure uninterrupted investment from the Global Fund, there is a need to implement fair TB care policies which support human rights-based approach."
https://openalex.org/W2310990218,"To investigate whether corneal thickness parameters measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT), such as central corneal thickness (CCT), central corneal stromal thickness (CCST), and central corneal epithelial thickness (CCET), influence the intraocular pressure (IOP) difference measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) and non-contact tonometry (NCT).In total, 50 eyes from 50 subjects without glaucomatous defects were included in this retrospective, cross-sectional study. We measured IOP using GAT and NCT and calculated the difference between the two methods. CCT was measured by a Cirrus HD-OCT device using anterior segment imaging. The basement membrane of the epithelium, which was seen as a high-reflection line in the OCT image, was taken as a reference line to measure CCST and CCET.The mean IOP measured by GAT and NCT was 16.7 ± 3.0 and 18.1 ± 3.8 mmHg, respectively. The mean IOP difference was 1.5 ± 1.7 mmHg, and the IOP measured by NCT was 8.4% ± 11.3% higher than that measured by GAT. The CCET and CCST were 57.9 ± 5.6 and 501.7 ± 33.8 μm, respectively. CCT showed a positive correlation with both GAT IOP (r = 0.648, P < 0.001) and NCT IOP (r = 0.676, P < 0.001). Although CCST showed a significant correlation with GAT IOP and NCT IOP, CCET did not. The difference between GAT IOP and NCT IOP increased with CCT (r = 0.333, P = 0.018), and CCET was positively correlated with the IOP difference between GAT and NCT (r = 0.435, P = 0.002).IOP increased with greater CCT, and CCST seemed to have a more important role than CCET. CCET also increased with greater CCT, and this may be a possible explanation for the increasing difference in IOP between GAT and NCT with increasing CCT."
https://openalex.org/W2325977752,"Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis are major causes of invasive bacterial infections in children under 5 years old in sub-Saharan Africa, with case fatality rates of ~20%. There are no licensed NTS vaccines for humans. Vaccines that induce antibodies against a Salmonella Typhi surface antigen, Vi polysaccharide, significantly protect humans against typhoid fever, establishing that immune responses to Salmonella surface antigens can be protective. Flagella proteins, abundant surface antigens in Salmonella serovars that cause human disease, are also powerful immunogens, but the functional capacity of elicited anti-flagellar antibodies and their role in facilitating bacterial clearance has been unclear. We examined the ability of anti-flagellar antibodies to mediate microbial killing by immune system components in-vitro and assessed their role in protecting mice against invasive Salmonella infection. Polyclonal (hyperimmune sera) and monoclonal antibodies raised against phase 1 flagellin proteins of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium facilitated bacterial uptake and killing of the homologous serovar pathogen by phagocytes. Polyclonal anti-flagellar antibodies accompanied by complement also achieved direct bacterial killing. Serum bactericidal activity was restricted to Salmonella serovars expressing the same flagellin used as immunogen. Notably, individual anti-flagellin monoclonal antibodies with complement were not bactericidal, but this biological activity was restored when different monoclonal anti-flagellin antibodies were combined. Passive transfer immunization with a monoclonal IgG antibody specific for phase 1 flagellin from S. Typhimurium protected mice against lethal challenge with a representative African invasive S. Typhimurium strain. These findings have relevance for the use of flagellin proteins in NTS vaccines, and confirm the role of anti-flagellin antibodies as mediators of protective immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2310996388,"Background Doxycycline (DOX) exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and pro-apoptotic activity and is being tested in clinical trials as a chemotherapeutic agent for several cancers, including colon cancer. Materials & Methods In the current study, the chemotherapeutic activity of doxycycline was tested in a rat model of colon carcinogenesis, induced by colon specific cancer promoter, 1,2, dimethylhydrazine (DMH) as well as study the effect of DOX-alone on a separate group of rats. Results Doxycycline administration in DMH-treated rats (DMH-DOX) unexpectedly increased tumor multiplicity, stimulated progression of colonic tumor growth from adenomas to carcinomas and revealed metastasis in small intestine as determined by macroscopic and histopathological analysis. DOX-alone treatment showed markedly enhanced chronic inflammation and reactive hyperplasia, which was dependent upon the dose of doxycycline administered. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed evidence of inflammation and anti-apoptotic action of DOX by deregulation of various biomarkers. Conclusion These results suggest that doxycycline caused chronic inflammation in colon, small intestine injury, enhanced the efficacy of DMH in tumor progression and provided a mechanistic link between doxycycline-induced chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. Ongoing studies thus may need to focus on the molecular mechanisms of doxycycline action, which lead to its inflammatory and tumorigenic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2330734062,"Vaginal microbicides potentially empower women to protect themselves from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially when culture, religion, or social status may prevent them from negotiating condom use. The open literature contains minimal information on factors that drive user acceptability of women's health products or vaginal drug delivery systems. By understanding what women find to be most important with regard to sensory properties and product functionality, developers can iteratively formulate a more desirable product. Conjoint analysis is a technique widely used in market research to determine what combination of elements influence a consumer's willingness to try or use a product. We applied conjoint analysis here to better understand what sexually-active woman want in a microbicide, toward our goal of formulating a product that is highly acceptable to women. Both sensory and non-sensory attributes were tested, including shape, color, wait time, partner awareness, messiness/leakage, duration of protection, and functionality. Heterosexually active women between 18 and 35 years of age in the United States (n = 302) completed an anonymous online conjoint survey using IdeaMap software. Attributes (product elements) were systematically presented in various combinations; women rated these combinations of a 9-point willingness-to-try scale. By coupling systematic combinations and regression modeling, we can estimate the unique appeal of each element. In this population, a multifunctional product (i.e., broad spectrum STI protection, coupled with conception) is far more desirable than a microbicide targeted solely for HIV protection; we also found partner awareness and leakage are potentially strong barriers to use."
https://openalex.org/W2305096012,"Testosterone (T) and related androgens are performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) abused by some athletes to gain competitive advantage. To monitor unauthorized androgen abuse, doping control programs use mass spectrometry (MS) to detect androgens, synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroids (AASs) and their metabolites in an athlete’s urine. AASs of unknown composition will not be detected by these procedures. Since AASs achieve their anabolic effects by activating the Androgen Receptor (AR), cell-based bioassays that measure the effect of a urine sample on AR activity are under investigation as complementary, pan-androgen detection methods. We evaluated an AR BioAssay as a monitor for androgen activity in urine pre-treated with glucuronidase, which releases T from the inactive T-glucuronide that predominates in urine. AR BioAssay activity levels were expressed as ‘T-equivalent’ concentrations by comparison to a T dose response curve. The T-equivalent concentrations of androgens in the urine of hypogonadal participants supplemented with T (in whom all androgenic activity should arise from T) were quantitatively identical to the T measurements conducted by MS at the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory (0.96 ± 0.22). All 17 AASs studied were active in the AR BioAssay; other steroids were inactive. 12 metabolites of 10 commonly abused AASs, which are used for MS monitoring of AAS doping because of their prolonged presence in urine, had reduced or no AR BioAssay activity. Thus, the AR BioAssay can accurately and inexpensively monitor T, but its ability to monitor urinary AASs will be limited to a period immediately following doping in which the active AASs remain intact."
https://openalex.org/W2307459766,"Pseudorabies (PR) is one of the most devastating diseases in the pig industry. To identify changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression and post-transcriptional regulatory responses to PRV infection in porcine kidney epithelial (PK15) cells, we sequenced a small RNA (sRNA) library prepared from infected PK15 cells and compared it to a library prepared from uninfected cells using Illumina deep sequencing. Here we found 25 novel viral miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing and 20 of these miRNAs were confirmed through stem-loop RT-qPCR. Intriguingly, unlike the usual miRNAs encoded by the α-herpesviruses, which are found clustered in the large latency transcript (LLT), these novel viral miRNAs are throughout the PRV genome like β-herpesviruses. Viral miRNAs are predicted to target multiple genes and form a complex regulatory network. GO analysis on host targets of viral miRNAs were involved in complex cellular processes, including the metabolic pathway, biological regulation, stimulus response, signaling process and immune response. Moreover, 13 host miRNAs were expressed with significant difference after infection with PRV: 8 miRNAs were up-regulated and 5 miRNAs were down-regulated, which may affect viral replication in host cell. Our results provided new insight into the characteristic of miRNAs in response to PRV infection, which is significant for further study of these miRNAs function."
https://openalex.org/W2307188722,"During hypovolemic shock, skeletal muscle blood flow could be redistributed to vital organs via vasoconstriction in part evoked by activation of the innervating sympathetic nerve activity. However, it is not well known whether this mechanism operates during anaphylactic shock. We determined the femoral artery blood flow (FBF) and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity (LSNA) mainly regulating the hindquater muscle blood flow during anaphylactic hypotension in anesthetized rats. Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to the following groups (n = 7/group): (1) non-sensitized, (2) anaphylaxis, (3) anaphylaxis-lumbar sympathectomy (LS) and (4) anaphylaxis-sinoaortic denervation (SAD) groups. Anaphylaxis was induced by an intravenous injection of the ovalbumin antigen to the sensitized rats. The systemic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), FBF and LSNA were continuously measured. In the anaphylaxis group, LSNA and HR increased, while SAP and FBF decreased after antigen injection. In the anaphylaxis-SAD group, LSNA did not significantly change during the early phase, but the responses of SAP and FBF were similar to those in the anaphylaxis group. In the anaphylaxis-LS group, both FBF and SAP decreased similarly to the anaphylaxis group during anaphylactic hypotension. These results indicated that LSNA increased via baroreceptor reflex, but this sympathoexcitation or LS did not affect antigen-induced decreases in FBF or SAP. Lumbar sympathetic nerves are not involved in regulation of the blood flow to the hindlimb or systemic blood pressure during anaphylactic hypotension in anesthetized rats."
https://openalex.org/W2321461609,"Objective To analyze plasma myostatin levels and investigate their relationship with right ventricular (RV) function in patients with cor pulmonale secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods The study recruited 81 patients with advanced COPD and 40 age-matched controls. The patients were divided into two groups: those with cor pulmonale and those without. Echocardiography was used to evaluate RV function and morphology, and the value of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) less than 16 mm was considered RV dysfunction. Plasma myostatin levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were analyzed as a comparison of myostatin. Results The data detected cor pulmonale in 39/81 patients, with the mean value of TAPSE of 14.3 mm. Plasma myostatin levels (ng/mL) were significantly higher in patients with cor pulmonale (16.68 ± 2.95) than in those without (13.56 ± 3.09), and much higher than in controls (8.79±2.79), with each p<0.01. Significant differences were also found in plasma BNP levels among the three groups (p<0.05). Multivariate regression analysis suggested that myostatin levels were significantly correlated with the values of TAPSE and RV myocardium performance index among the COPD patients, and that BNP levels were significantly correlated only with systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, with each p<0.05. Conclusions Plasma myostatin levels are increased in COPD patients who have cor pulmonale. Stronger correlations of plasma myostatin levels with echocardiographic indexes of the right heart suggest that myostatin might be superior to BNP in the early diagnosis of cor pulmonale in COPD."

Frequent neurological complaints include foot numbness and leg weakness. In this study, we compared the distribution of the body weight on different areas of the foot in HTLV-1 patients with HAM/TSP, asymptomatic HTLV-1 patients, and healthy individuals.We studied 36 HTLV-1 infected patients, who were divided in two groups of 18 patients each based on whether or not they had been diagnosed with HAM/TSP, and 17 control subjects. The evaluation included an interview on the patient's clinical history and examinations of the patient's reflexes, foot skin tactile sensitivity, and risk of falling. The pressure distribution on different areas of the foot was measured with baropodometry, using a pressure platform, while the patients had their eyes open or closed.The prevalence of neurological disturbances-altered reflexes and skin tactile sensitivity and increased risk of falling-was higher in HTLV-1 HAM/TSP patients than in HTLV-1 asymptomatic patients. The medium and maximum pressure values were higher in the forefoot than in the midfoot and hindfoot in both HTLV-1 groups. In addition, the pressure on the hindfoot was lower in HAM/TSP patients compared to control subjects.The neurological disturbances associated with HTLV-1 infection gradually worsened from HTLV-1 asymptomatic patients to HAM/TSP patients. Baropodometry is a valuable tool to establish the extent of neurological damage in patients suffering from HTLV-1 infection."

Such research is also lacking in the Han population. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between APOE genotype, diabetes, and plasma glucose and lipid levels. We included 243 community-dwelling elderly residents in this study. Participant APOE genotypes were assessed and were simultaneously tested for weight, height, blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and high- and low-density lipoprotein. In addition, gender, age, years of education, cognitive function, and medical history was recorded. Subjects were divided into 3 groups based on APOE genotype: APOE ε2 group (ε2/ε2 and ε2/ε3), APOE ε3 group (ε3/ε3), and APOE ε4 group (ε2/ε4, ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4). Comparisons between groups were conducted for the incidence of diabetes, high blood pressure, and dementia, as well as for differences in body-mass index, fasting plasma glucose, and blood lipids. The APOE ε3/ε3 genotype exhibited the highest frequency (70.4%) among the subjects. Participants in the APOE ε3 group demonstrated significantly higher levels of fasting plasma glucose than those in the APOE ε2 and APOE ε4 groups (P<0.05). The APOE ε3 group had slightly higher abnormal fasting plasma glucose values than did the APOE ε2 group (P = 0.065). Furthermore, the APOE3 genotype was significantly correlated with both fasting plasma glucose level and glucose abnormality (P< 0.05) and trended toward statistically significant correlation with diabetes (P = 0.082). The correlation between APOE2 and low low-density lipoprotein levels also approached statistical significance (P = 0.052). Thus, elderly community dwelling residents of Han ethnicity carrying the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype might have higher plasma glucose levels and a higher occurrence of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2307909279,"Mirror neurons are visuo-motor neurons found in primates and thought to be significant for imitation learning. The proposition that mirror neurons result from associative learning while the neonate observes his own actions has received noteworthy empirical support. Self-exploration is regarded as a procedure by which infants become perceptually observant to their own body and engage in a perceptual communication with themselves. We assume that crude sense of self is the prerequisite for social interaction. However, the contribution of mirror neurons in encoding the perspective from which the motor acts of others are seen have not been addressed in relation to humanoid robots. In this paper we present a computational model for development of mirror neuron system for humanoid based on the hypothesis that infants acquire MNS by sensorimotor associative learning through self-exploration capable of sustaining early imitation skills. The purpose of our proposed model is to take into account the view-dependency of neurons as a probable outcome of the associative connectivity between motor and visual information. In our experiment, a humanoid robot stands in front of a mirror (represented through self-image using camera) in order to obtain the associative relationship between his own motor generated actions and his own visual body-image. In the learning process the network first forms mapping from each motor representation onto visual representation from the self-exploratory perspective. Afterwards, the representation of the motor commands is learned to be associated with all possible visual perspectives. The complete architecture was evaluated by simulation experiments performed on DARwIn-OP humanoid robot."
