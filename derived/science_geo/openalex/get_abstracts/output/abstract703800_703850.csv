https://openalex.org/W4308458879,"Super-resolution techniques have achieved localization precisions in the nanometer regime. Here we report all-optical, room temperature localization of fluorophores with precision in the Ångström range. We built on the concept of MINSTED nanoscopy where precision is increased by encircling the fluorophore with the low-intensity central region of a stimulated emission depletion (STED) donut beam while constantly increasing the absolute donut power. By blue-shifting the STED beam and separating fluorophores by on/off switching, individual fluorophores bound to a DNA strand are localized with σ = 4.7 Å, corresponding to a fraction of the fluorophore size, with only 2,000 detected photons. MINSTED fluorescence nanoscopy with single-digit nanometer resolution is exemplified by imaging nuclear pore complexes and the distribution of nuclear lamin in mammalian cells labeled by transient DNA hybridization. Because our experiments yield a localization precision σ = 2.3 Å, estimated for 10,000 detected photons, we anticipate that MINSTED will open up new areas of application in the study of macromolecular complexes in cells."

However, the cellular mechanisms involved in tau propagation remain unclear. Here, we performed an unbiased quantitative proteomic study to identify proteins that specifically interact with this tau seed. We identified Bassoon (BSN), a presynaptic scaffolding protein, as an interactor of the tau seed isolated from a mouse model of tauopathy, and from Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy postmortem samples. We show that BSN exacerbates tau seeding and toxicity in both mouse and Drosophila models for tauopathy, and that BSN downregulation decreases tau spreading and overall disease pathology, rescuing synaptic and behavioral impairments and reducing brain atrophy. Our findings improve the understanding of how tau seeds can be stabilized by interactors such as BSN. Inhibiting tau-seed interactions is a potential new therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative tauopathies."

Here, we report a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping and document structural details at atomic resolution. The NiRAN domain in polymerase catalyzes the covalent link of RNA 5' end to the first residue of nsp9 (termed as RNAylation), thus being an intermediate to form cap core (GpppA) with GTP catalyzed again by NiRAN. We also reveal that triphosphorylated nucleotide analog inhibitors can be bonded to nsp9 and fit into a previously unknown ""Nuc-pocket"" in NiRAN, thus inhibiting nsp9 RNAylation and formation of GpppA. S-loop (residues 50-KTN-52) in NiRAN presents a remarkable conformational shift observed in RTC bound with sofosbuvir monophosphate, reasoning an ""induce-and-lock"" mechanism to design inhibitors. These findings not only improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping and the mode of action of NAIs but also provide a strategy to design antiviral drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4308430748,"Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a versatile technique to evaluate the intracellular molecular exchange called turnover. Mechanochemical models of FRAP typically consider the molecular diffusion and chemical reaction that simultaneously occur on a time scale of seconds to minutes. Particularly for long-term measurements, however, a mechanical advection effect can no longer be ignored, which transports the proteins in specific directions within the cells and accordingly shifts the spatial distribution of the local chemical equilibrium. Nevertheless, existing FRAP models have not considered the spatial shift, and as such, the turnover rate is often analyzed without considering the spatiotemporally updated chemical equilibrium. Here we develop a new FRAP model aimed at long-term measurements to quantitatively determine the two distinct effects of the advection and chemical reaction, i.e., the different major sources of the change in fluorescence intensity. To validate this approach, we carried out FRAP experiments on actin in stress fibers over a time period of more than 900 s, and the advection rate was shown to be comparable in magnitude to the chemical dissociation rate. We further found that the actin-myosin interaction and actin polymerization differently affect the advection and chemical dissociation. Our results suggest that the distinction between the two effects is indispensable to extract the intrinsic chemical properties of the actin cytoskeleton from the observations of complicated turnover in cells."

It contains a variety of toxins, such as chemicals and heavy metals, which damage the soil and crops. In this regard, the aim of the research was to assess the potential health hazards of iron (Fe) metal in food crops (leafy and root crops) treated with wastewater (T_1), canal water (T_2), and tube well water (T_3). Water, soil, and edible components of food crops were collected at random from three distinct locations. Fe concentration in samples was estimated using atomic absorption spectrophotometer, following wet digestion method. The Fe concentrations, ranged from 0.408 to 1.03 mg/l in water, 31.55 to 187.47 mgkg-1 in soil and 4.09 to 32.583 mgkg-1 in crop samples; which were within permissible limits of the World Health Organization (WHO). There was a positive correlation between soils and crops. The bioconcentration factor, enrichment factor (EF), daily intake of metals (DIM), health risk index (HRI), and target hazard quotient (THQ) all values were &lt;1, except for a pollution load index &gt;1, which indicated soil contamination, but there was no Fe toxicity in crops, no health risk, and no-carcinogenic risk for these food crops in humans. To prevent the excessive accumulation of Fe metal in the food chain, regular monitoring is needed."

This study was designed to investigate the association of RANKL and OPG gene polymorphisms with breast to bone metastasis in Pashtun population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.A total of 215 participants were enrolled containing 106 breast cancer patients, 58 breast to bone metastasis and 51 age and gender matched healthy controls. RANKL (rs9533156) and OPG (rs2073618, rs3102735) polymorphisms were genotyped in genomic DNA, using Tetra-ARMS PCR protocol. The results were analyzed among the three groups and P-value less then 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Our results displayed significant association of OPG (rs3102735) risk allele and corresponding genotypes in breast cancer vs healthy controls, bone metastasis vs healthy controls and breast cancer vs breast to bone metastasis as a disease risk. However, there was no association observed for OPG (rs2073618) risk allele and corresponding genotypes with the diseases risk. Similarly, RANKL (rs9533156) risk allele and corresponding genotypes in breast cancer vs healthy controls, bone metastasis vs healthy controls and breast cancer vs breast to bone metastasis exhibited significant association except for the risk allele carrying genotypes in breast to bone metastasis.OPG (rs3102735) and RANKL (rs9533156) exhibited significant association with breast to bone metastasis while OPG (rs2073618) didn't show significant association with breast to bone metastasis in Pashtun population of Pakistan. However, this study unlocks more questions to investigate the exact scenario of genetic predisposition of breast to bone metastasis."

This study measures the level of the digital economy and high-quality economic development based on the panel data of 31 provinces in China from 2013 to 2020. On this basis, the direct, spillover, and mediating effects of the digital economy and scientific and technological innovation on high-quality economic development are further analysed through the spatial Durbin model and mediating effect model. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) the digital economy, scientific and technological innovation, and high-quality economic development all show significant spatial correlation; (2) the digital economy can directly drive high-quality economic development, the spillover effect of which is obvious; and (3) the mechanism analysis based on the spatial perspective shows that the mediating effect of scientific and technological innovation is significant. The conclusions still hold after robustness tests based on the use of lagged variables, replacement of the weight matrices, and changing of the measurement methods. This study provides theoretical support and empirical evidence for promoting the digital economy and high-quality economic development."
https://openalex.org/W4308430940,"Evidence on potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia is accumulating rapidly, including e.g. physical inactivity, hypertension, or diabetes. It is unclear to what extent these risk factors are known among the general population in Germany. We investigated knowledge on risk and protective factors for dementia and openness to eHealth interventions for brain health in the older general population in Germany.A population-based telephone survey among randomly selected community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 60 years was conducted. We assessed sociodemographic factors, knowledge on risk and protective factors for dementia, openness towards eHealth and psychosocial outcomes (health literacy, resilience). Factors associated with interest in information on brain health and openness towards eHealth interventions were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.Of n = 500 respondents (mean age: 74.8 years, % female: 62.8), 67.9% believed that dementia risk is modifiable. Participants mostly endorsed physical and cognitive activity as protective factors and social isolation as a risk factor. Knowledge on cardiovascular risk factors was low to moderate. 38.0% were interested in information on dementia risk reduction. Better knowledge of risk factors for dementia and higher age were linked to interest in information on brain health. Being widowed and higher levels of health literacy were associated with lower interest in information. Openness to eHealth interventions was moderate (46.2%). Younger age, better knowledge of risk and protective factors were linked to openness towards eHealth tools, as was knowing someone with dementia and interest in information on brain health.Belief in preventability of dementia was higher in our sample than previously reported. However, knowledge on cardiovascular risk factors for disease was insufficient and more information and intervention approaches targeted at older adults are needed. Interest in information on dementia risk reduction and eHealth approaches was moderate, and further studies are warranted to assess needs and concerns of older adults regarding dementia prevention."
https://openalex.org/W4308431898,"Background Lowered mental wellbeing of students is a growing health and societal problem. Experiencing high levels of stress for a longer period of time has been associated with an increased risk for lower mental wellbeing and mental health problems. To reduce stress and improve mental wellbeing it is important to understand how various sources of stress are related with mental wellbeing and which factors can buffer the impact of stress on mental wellbeing. Objectives Deriving from a conceptual model the aim of the study was to explore 1) the association of underlying stressors (academic pressure, family circumstances, side-activity pressure, and financial situation) with perceived stress and mental wellbeing, 2) whether perceived stress mediates the association between the sources of stress and mental wellbeing and 3) whether loneliness, self-esteem, personality and coping styles buffer or reinforce the impact of perceived stress on mental wellbeing. Method A cross-sectional survey design was used among students of an University of Applied Sciences and conducted between November 16, 2020, and January 18, 2021. Study variables were mental wellbeing, perceived stress, academic pressure, financial pressure, family pressure and side-activity pressure, coping style, self-esteem, loneliness, personality. The questionnaire was constructed using validated measures. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between perceived stress, sources of stress and mental wellbeing. Mediation and moderation processes were explored using Hayes PROCESS models. Results A total of 875 university students (37,2% male, 62,3% female, mean age 21,6) participated. Perceived stress had a strong negative association with mental wellbeing (unstandardized regression coefficient ( b) = -.848, p &lt; .001; r = -.667, p &lt; .01), explaining 45% of the variance. Academic pressure ( b = -8.014, p &lt; .01), family pressure ( b = -3.189, p &lt; .01), side-activity pressure ( b = -3.032, p &lt; .01) and financial pressure ( b = -2.041, p &lt; .01) all had a negative impact on mental wellbeing. This effect was mediated by perceived stress, but a direct effect remained for academic pressure ( b = -3.306, p &lt; .01) and family pressure ( b = -1.130, p &lt; .01). Significant interaction effects between perceived stress and mental wellbeing were found for approach coping (low = -.93, p &lt; .01; high = -.64, p &lt; .01) and emotional stability (low = -.81, p &lt; .01; high = -.64, p &lt; .01). Conclusion Perceived stress has a major impact on students’ mental wellbeing. Underlying stressors were mediated by perceived stress, but direct effects were also found. To protect the mental wellbeing of students, it is urgent to reduce perceived stress, suppress underlying stressors and make students more resilient through the development of found buffers, such as approach coping."
https://openalex.org/W4308099320,"Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway important for neuronal development, function, and survival. How autophagy in axons is regulated by neurotrophins to impact neuronal viability and function is poorly understood. Here, we use live-cell imaging in primary neurons to investigate the regulation of axonal autophagy by the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and elucidate whether autophagosomes carry BDNF-mediated signaling information. We find that BDNF induces autophagic flux in primary neurons by stimulating the retrograde pathway for autophagy in axons. We observed an increase in autophagosome density and retrograde flux in axons, and a corresponding increase in autophagosome density in the soma. However, we find little evidence of autophagosomes comigrating with BDNF. In contrast, BDNF effectively engages its cognate receptor TrkB to undergo retrograde transport in the axon. These compartments, however, are distinct from LC3-positive autophagic organelles in the axon. Together, we find that BDNF stimulates autophagy in the axon, but retrograde autophagosomes do not appear to carry BDNF cargo. Thus, autophagosomes likely do not play a major role in relaying neurotrophic signaling information across the axon in the form of active BDNF/TrkB complexes. Rather, BDNF likely stimulates autophagy as a consequence of BDNF-induced processes that require canonical roles for autophagy in degradation."

The multiplier for salmonellosis and V . parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis was estimated at 4,137 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2,320–5,663], and for shigellosis at 4,356 (95% CI 2,443–5,963). Annual incidence per 100,000 population was estimated as 245 (95% CI 138–336), 67 (95% CI 38–92), and 806 (95% CI 452–1,103) for foodborne salmonellosis, shigellosis, and V . parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis, respectively, indicating that foodborne infection caused by these three pathogens constitutes an important burden to the Chinese healthcare system. Continuous implementation of active surveillance of foodborne diseases, combined with multiplier models to estimate disease burden, makes it possible for us to better understand food safety status in China."

The results highlight three main points that (1) the displacement risk by artificial intelligence has significantly negative effects on occupational wage and employment, (2) the heterogeneous effects across occupational characteristics are significant, and (3) the digital skill exerts a significant moderation effect to protect against displacement risk. The core policy implication is suggested to emphasize digital skill in education and training across occupations to accommodate job requirements in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4308576166,"Due to the high prevalence of patients attending with urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms, the use of flow-cytometry as a rapid screening tool to avoid unnecessary cultures is becoming a widely used system in clinical practice. However, the recommended cut-points applied in flow-cytometry systems differ substantially among authors, making it difficult to obtain reliable conclusions. Here, we present FlowUTI, a shiny web-application created to establish optimal cut-off values in flow-cytometry for different UTI markers, such as bacterial or leukocyte counts, in urine from patients with UTI symptoms. This application provides a user-friendly graphical interface to perform robust statistical analysis without a specific training. Two datasets are analyzed in this manuscript: one composed of 204 urine samples from neonates and infants (≤3 months old) attended in the emergency department with suspected UTI; and the second dataset including 1174 urines samples from an elderly population attended at the primary care level. The source code is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/GuillermoMG-HUVR/Microbiology-applications/tree/FlowUTI/FlowUTI ). The web application can be executed locally from the R console. Alternatively, it can be freely accessed at https://covidiario.shinyapps.io/flowuti/ . FlowUTI provides an easy-to-use environment for evaluating the efficiency of the urinary screening process with flow-cytometry, reducing the computational burden associated with this kind of analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4308367591,"Ornate, large, extremophilic (OLE) RNAs represent a class of noncoding RNAs prevalent in Gram-positive, extremophilic/anaerobic bacterial species. OLE RNAs (∼600 nt), whose precise biochemical functions remain mysterious, form an intricate secondary structure interspersed with regions of highly conserved nucleotides. In the alkali-halophilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans, OLE RNA is a component of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex involving at least two proteins named OapA and OapB, but additional components may exist that could point to functional roles for the RNA. Disruption of the genes for either OLE RNA, OapA, or OapB result in the inability of cells to overcome cold, alcohol, or Mg2+ stresses. In the current study, we used in vivo crosslinking followed by OLE RNA isolation to identify the protein YbxF as a potential additional partner in the OLE RNP complex. Notably, a mutation in the gene for this same protein was also reported to be present in a strain wherein the complex is nonfunctional. The B. halodurans YbxF (herein renamed OapC) is homologous to a bacterial protein earlier demonstrated to bind kink turn (k-turn) RNA structural motifs. In vitro RNA-protein binding assays reveal that OLE RNA forms a previously unrecognized k-turn that serves as the natural binding site for YbxF/OapC. Moreover, B. halodurans cells carrying OLE RNAs with disruptive mutations in the k-turn exhibit phenotypes identical to cells lacking functional OLE RNP complexes. These findings reveal that the YbxF/OapC protein of B. halodurans is important for the formation of a functional OLE RNP complex."
https://openalex.org/W4308411309,"Fibromyalgia (FM) patients have dysfunctional endogenous pain modulation, where opioid and serotonergic signaling is implicated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variants in the genes coding for major structures in the opioid and serotonergic systems can affect pain modulation in FM patients and healthy controls (HC). Conditioned pain modulation (CPM), evaluating the effects of ischemic pain on pressure pain sensitivity, was performed in 82 FM patients and 43 HC. All subjects were genotyped for relevant functional polymorphisms in the genes coding for the μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1, rs1799971), the serotonin transporter (5-HTT, 5-HTTLPR/rs25531) and the serotonin 1a receptor (5-HT1a, rs6295). Results showed the OPRM1 G-allele was associated with decreased CPM. A significant gene-to-gene interaction was found between the OPRM1 and the 5-HT1a gene. Reduced CPM scores were seen particularly in individuals with the OPRM1 G*/5-HT1a CC genotype, indicating that the 5-HT1a CC genotype seems to have an inhibiting effect on CPM if an individual has the OPRM1 G-genotype. Thus, regardless of pain phenotype, the OPRM1 G-allele independently as well as with an interaction with the 5-HT1a gene influenced pain modulation. FM patients had lower CPM than HC but no group differences were found regarding the genetic effects on CPM, indicating that the results reflect more general mechanisms influencing pain modulatory processes rather than underlying the dysfunction of CPM in FM. In conclusion, a genetic variant known to alter the expression of, and binding to, the my-opioid receptor reduced a subject's ability to activate descending pain inhibition. Also, the results suggest a genetically inferred gene-to-gene interaction between the main opioid receptor and a serotonergic structure essential for 5-HT transmission to modulate pain inhibition. The results in this study highlight the importance of studying joint synergistic and antagonistic effects of neurotransmittor systems in regard to pain modulation."
https://openalex.org/W4308411329,"The decline in the population of ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in northwestern Germany since 2007 raises questions about the underlying causes. We therefore studied the growth and immune status of ring-necked pheasant chicks dependent on different feed composition. Here, 490 ring-necked pheasant chicks were raised in five groups up to nine weeks. While control groups C1 and C2 received sufficient crude protein (28%) and energy (12.5 MJ/Kg feed) according to current standards, group C2 was treated with cyclosporine eight hours prior to phythemagglutination (PHA) testing, serving as a positive immune suppressed control. Group V1 was fed with reduced protein (20%) but optimal energy content (12.5 MJ/Kg feed), group V2 was fed with sufficient protein (28%) and reduced energy content (10 MJ/kg feed) whereas group V3 was fed reduced crude protein (20%) and reduced energy content (10MJ/kg feed). On all chicks, health status was checked each week, and 20 birds of each group were weighed randomly per week. PHA-testing was performed on 12 birds of each group to study the in vivo non-specific activation of lymphocytes at week 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9. In addition, hemolysis-hemagglutination-assay (HHA) was performed on each of the PHA-tested chicks, which were subsequently euthanized and dissected. Histopathologic examinations of 5 birds that were randomly chosen were performed. The PHA-test results demonstrate significant differences between control (C1, C2) and experimental groups (V1-V3) in several developmental stages. According to the HHA results, weekly testing detected a significant increase of titres per week in all groups without significant differences. Here, only hemagglutination and no lysis of samples was observed. It seems appropriate to conclude that during their first weeks of life, protein content is of higher importance in ring-necked pheasant chicks than energy intake. In particular T-cell response is significantly reduced, which indicate a weaker immune system resulting in a higher risk for clinical diseases. Therefore, we assume that protein i.e. insect availability is a highly important co-factor in the free-ranging population dynamics, and is linked to declines of the northwestern German population."

Despite active preventive measures to control the spread of ASFV, outbreaks on pig farms and in wild boar have been increasing. In this study, we investigated the spatial contamination area using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) approach, and growth rate using a logistic diffusion model. On the basis of the ASFV outbreak locations recorded from September 17th, 2019, to May 20th, 2022, the MCP area for the second week was 618.41 km2 and expanded to 37959.67 km2 in the final week. The maximum asymptote of the logistic function was considered as the land area of South Korea, and we estimated logistic growth rates of 0.022 km2 per week and 0.094 km2 per month. Administrative bodies should implement preventive and quarantine measures for infectious diseases. The results of this study will be a reference for epidemiologists, ecologists, and policy makers and contribute to the establishment of appropriate quarantine measures for disease control and management."
https://openalex.org/W4308411342,"Microtubule acetylation is found in populations of stable, long-lived microtubules, occurring on the conserved lysine 40 (K40) residue of α-tubulin by α-tubulin acetyltransferases (αTATs). α-tubulin K40 acetylation has been shown to stabilize microtubules via enhancing microtubule resilience against mechanical stress. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized αTAT, Drosophila CG17003/leaky ( lky ), is required for α-tubulin K40 acetylation in early germ cells in Drosophila ovary. We found that loss of lky resulted in a progressive egg chamber fusion phenotype accompanied with mislocalization of germline-specific Vasa protein in somatic follicle cells. The same phenotype was observed upon replacement of endogenous α-tubulin84B with non-acetylatable α-tubulin84B K40A , suggesting α-tubulin K40 acetylation is responsible for the phenotype. Chemical disturbance of microtubules by Colcemid treatment resulted in a mislocalization of Vasa in follicle cells within a short period of time (~30 min), suggesting that the observed mislocalization is likely caused by direct leakage of cellular contents between germline and follicle cells. Taken together, this study provides a new function of α-tubulin acetylation in maintaining the cellular identity possibly by preventing the leakage of tissue-specific gene products between juxtaposing distinct cell types."
https://openalex.org/W4308411489,"Background Fewer than 10% of people with hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa are diagnosed, linked to care, and achieve hypertension control. We hypothesized that a one-time financial incentive and phone call reminder for missed appointments would increase linkage to hypertension care following community-based screening in rural Uganda and Kenya. Methods In a randomized controlled trial, we conducted community-based hypertension screening and enrolled adults ≥25 years with blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg on three measures; we excluded participants with known hypertension or hypertensive emergency. The intervention was transportation reimbursement upon linkage (~$5 USD) and up to three reminder phone calls for those not linking within seven days. Control participants received a clinic referral only. Outcomes were linkage to hypertension care within 30 days (primary) and hypertension control &lt;140/90 mmHg measured in all participants at 90 days (secondary). We used targeted minimum loss-based estimation to compute adjusted risk ratios (aRR). Results We screened 1,998 participants, identifying 370 (18.5%) with uncontrolled hypertension and enrolling 199 (100 control, 99 intervention). Reasons for non-enrollment included prior hypertension diagnosis (n = 108) and hypertensive emergency (n = 32). Participants were 60% female, median age 56 (range 27–99); 10% were HIV-positive and 42% had baseline blood pressure ≥160/100 mmHg. Linkage to care within 30 days was 96% in intervention and 66% in control (aRR 1.45, 95%CI 1.25–1.68). Hypertension control at 90 days was 51% intervention and 41% control (aRR 1.22, 95%CI 0.92–1.66). Conclusion A one-time financial incentive and reminder call for missed visits resulted in a 30% absolute increase in linkage to hypertension care following community-based screening. Financial incentives can improve the critical step of linkage to care for people newly diagnosed with hypertension in the community."
https://openalex.org/W4308430906,"Heatstroke is a serious heat-related illness that can even cause death. Heat alert systems play an important role in reducing the number of patients experiencing heat illness, as they encourage preventive actions such as the use of air conditioning, hydration, or other strategies. However, to date, the Japanese hazard classification has not considered seasonal and regional variations, despite clear differences in meteorological conditions across different regions in Japan. Moreover, several studies have reported a difference in thermoregulation between older and younger adults, implying that the hazard classification should also consider age differences. This study examined the relationship between the number of ambulance dispatches related to heat illness (ADRHI) and the Japanese heat hazard classification from 2010 to 2019, focusing on monthly and regional differences. Data from 47 prefectures during the 10-year period were collected and analyzed. ADRHI and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) data were collected from Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and the Ministry of the Environment Heat Illness Prevention Information website, respectively. The findings showed a significant relationship between ADRHI and WBGT max (p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.74). ADRHI per 100,000 people showed significant differences across months. The post hoc test detected the first steep increase in ADRHI at a WBGT max of 23°C than at 22°C in June, and at a WBGT max of 26°C, 27°C, and 25°C in July, August, and September, respectively. Moreover, the first significant increase in ADRHI per 100,000 people at WBGT max differed across each region, at a WBGT max of 24°C in Hokkaido-Tohoku, 25°C in Kanto, Kansai, and Chugoku, 26°C in Chubu, 27°C in Shikoku, and 28°C in Kyushu-Okinawa. Further, Poisson regression analysis revealed that the relative risks differed across each region and month. These results imply that the hazard classification should be adjusted according to region and month in Japan."

The aim of this nationwide study was first to address whether short-term effects of hospital-based outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) are similar across educational level and ethnic background, and secondly to study whether known disparity in long-term prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disese is diminished by CR participation. Methods All patients with myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularization from August 2015 until March 2018 in the Danish national patient registry or the Danish cardiac rehabilitation database (DHRD) were included. We used descriptive statistics to address disparity in achievement of quality indicators in CR, and Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between the disparity measures and MACE (cardiovascular hospitalization and all-cause mortality) with adjustment for age, gender, index-diagnose and co-morbidity. Results We identified 34,511 patients of whom 19,383 had participated in CR and 9,882 provided information on CR outcomes from the DHRD. We demonstrated a socioeconomic gradient in improvements in VO 2peak , and non-western patients were less often screened for depression or receive dietary consulting. We found a strong socioeconomic gradient in MACE irrespective of CR participation, medication, and risk factor control (adjusted HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.56–0.77) for high versus low education). Non-western origin was associated with higher risk of MACE (adjusted HR 1.2 (1.1–1.4)). Conclusion We found only minor socioeconomic and ethnic differences in achievement of CR quality indicators but strong differences in CHD prognosis indication that conventional risk factor control and medical treatment following CR do not diminish the socioeconomic and ethnical disparity in CHD prognosis."

Moreover, the restoration and actual conservation practices for traditional dwellings, which were specifically both government-led and private projects, were examined. In these analyses, the main problems related to the decay phenomena investigation and intervention are systematically summarized, and corresponding solutions are proposed to ensure that optimized conservation strategies are applied to traditional dwellings in Hongcun village."
https://openalex.org/W4308431743,"DNA extraction, a vital pre-requisite for most biological studies, continues to be studied extensively. According to some studies, DNA shows a certain degree of absorbability on filter paper made of plant fiber-based adsorbent material. However, the principle underlying such specific adsorption as well as plant species associated with plant fiber-based adsorbents and optimized extraction conditions have not yet been studied. This study demonstrates the tight correlation between crystallinity and hygroscopicity in plant fiber-based adsorbents used for DNA extraction and proposes the concept of DNA adsorption on plant fiber-based adsorbents, for the first time. We also explored optimal extracting and eluting conditions and developed a novel plant fiber-based DNA extraction method that was quadruple times more powerful than current approaches. Starting with the screening of various types of earthed plant fiber-based adsorbents, we went on to mine new plant fiber-based adsorbents, bamboo paper and degreased cotton, and succeeded in increasing their efficiency of DNA extraction to 4.2 times than that of current approaches. We found a very strong correlation between the crystallinity and hygroscopicity of plant fiber-based adsorbents which showed efficiency for DNA extraction, and thus propose a principle that potentially governs such specific adsorption processes, in the hope that this information may guide related multidisciplinary research studies in the future. Nanodrop, electrophoresis and PCR were selected to demonstrate the quantity, quality, integrity and utility of the extracted DNA. Furthermore, crystallinity, hygroscopicity, pore size distribution and composition of plant fiber-based adsorbents were studied to explore their correlation in an attempt to understand the principle underlying this particular type of adsorption. The findings of this study may be further extended to the extraction of other types of nucleic acids with similar biochemical properties."

KRT14+ progenitor cells are found to be the main progenitors for maintaining the ductal homeostasis of the submandibular SGs. In this study, we investigated the role of ATG5 in SG KRT14+ cells in mice and humans. Human labial salivary glands (LSG) from primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and non-pSS patients (normal), and submandibular glands (SMG) from Atg5flox/flox; Krt14-Cre (cKO) mice were used. ATG5+KRT14+ and p62+KRT14+ cells were detected by immunofluorescence staining in LSG. TUNEL, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blot were performed to detect cell death in SMG. Saliva was collected in 12-week-old (12 W) and 32-week-old (32 W) mice, then the concentration of calcium and buffering capacity were detected to analyze the function of SG. We found that LSG from pSS patients showed increased p62 and decreased ATG5 in KRT14+ cells. We further revealed that in 32 W, (1) the function of salivary glands was significantly impaired in cKO mice, (2) cell death increased in cKO mice, but cl-Caspase 3 was not significantly changed, and (3) cleaved gasdermin D increased and was highly expressed in KRT14+ cells of cKO mice. After applying a pyroptosis inhibitor to 32 W mice, the reduced saliva flow rate was rescued. In addition, pyroptosis was also found in KRT14+ cells of pSS patients. Collectively, our results indicate that Atg5 deficiency would induce pyroptosis in mice SG, which could lead to functional impairments of SG."
https://openalex.org/W4308459060,"Despite their fundamental role in assessing (patho)physiological cell states, conventional gene reporters can follow gene expression but leave scars on the proteins or substantially alter the mature messenger RNA. Multi-time-point measurements of non-coding RNAs are currently impossible without modifying their nucleotide sequence, which can alter their native function, half-life and localization. Thus, we developed the intron-encoded scarless programmable extranuclear cistronic transcript (INSPECT) as a minimally invasive transcriptional reporter embedded within an intron of a gene of interest. Post-transcriptional excision of INSPECT results in the mature endogenous RNA without sequence alterations and an additional engineered transcript that leaves the nucleus by hijacking the nuclear export machinery for subsequent translation into a reporter or effector protein. We showcase its use in monitoring interleukin-2 (IL2) after T cell activation and tracking the transcriptional dynamics of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 during CRISPR interference-mediated perturbation. INSPECT is a method for monitoring gene transcription without altering the mature lncRNA or messenger RNA of the target of interest."

We test this causal link in an experiment where subjects viewed a video featuring either an urban (control treatment) or a nature setting (nature treatment). We consider two types of behavior: a monetary donation to an environmental non-governmental organization (ENGO) that we call an eco-donation, and subsequently, a non-monetary decision (i.e., recycle or not recycle headphone protectors) that we call an eco-action. We find that virtual exposure to nature boosts both eco-donation and eco-action. Interestingly, the increase in PEB only occurs for individuals who express low environmental values. We did not find any negative or positive spillover effects on the eco-action. We finally provide robustness checks and discuss policy implications."
https://openalex.org/W4308576181,"In this paper, we present evidence from a lab-in-the-field experiment of the effects of the Chinese one-child policy on adults in China who were born just before and after the introduction of the policy. We measure risk, uncertainty, and time preferences, as well as subjects' preferences in the social domain, i.e., concerning competitiveness, cooperation, and bargaining. We sampled people from three Chinese provinces born both before and after the introduction of the policy in 1979. We utilize the fact that the one-child policy was introduced at different times and with different degrees of strictness in different provinces. Overall, we find a statistically significant effect only on risk and uncertainty aversion and not on any other preferences in the experiments: Those born after the introduction of the one-child policy are less risk and uncertainty averse. These results hold for various robustness checks and heterogeneity tests. Hence, our results do not confirm the general wisdom and stereotype of only-children in China being ""little emperors."""
https://openalex.org/W4308576624,"While on the street, HIV infection among street-connected children is a challenging issue due to the nature of transmission, distribution, and prevention. Lack of proper care and protection, insufficient knowledge of the danger of acquiring HIV, and insufficient or absence of health facilities serving street-connected children have left this vulnerable group engaging in high-risk behaviors exposing them to acquiring HIV. This cross-sectional study aimed at estimating the prevalence of HIV infection and its associated risk factors among street-connected children aged between 10 to17 years in Mwanza City. The study was granted ethical clearance all permissions and restrictions to work with street-connected children were adhered to. A total of 131 participants aged 10-17 years were recruited for interviews and HIV testing. Exact logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with having HIV. A total of 111 (85.0%) boys and 20 (15.0%) girls responded to the questionnaire, with the median age being 15years. The overall HIV prevalence was 12.2% (16/131). Street-children using condoms were less likely to be affected by HIV compared to those who were not using (OR = 0.24; 95% CI 0.04-0.97). Females had higher odds of HIV infection compared to males (OR = 5.24; 95% CI of 1.24-24.65). The study shows a significantly higher prevalence of HIV among street-connected children as compared to the general population. Therefore, there should be tailored reproductive and sexual health programs, with the provision of protective materials like condoms."
https://openalex.org/W4226135264,"Prioritizing genes for their role in drug sensitivity, is an important step in understanding drugs mechanisms of action and discovering new molecular targets for co-treatment. To formalize this problem, we consider two sets of genes X and P respectively composing the gene signature of cell sensitivity at the drug IC50 and the genes involved in its mechanism of action, as well as a protein interaction network (PPIN) containing the products of X and P as nodes. We introduce Genetrank, a method to prioritize the genes in X for their likelihood to regulate the genes in P. Genetrank uses asymmetric random walks with restarts, absorbing states, and a suitable renormalization scheme. Using novel so-called saturation indices, we show that the conjunction of absorbing states and renormalization yields an exploration of the PPIN which is much more progressive than that afforded by random walks with restarts only. Using MINT as underlying network, we apply Genetrank to a predictive gene signature of cancer cells sensitivity to tumor-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), performed in single-cells. Our ranking provides biological insights on drug sensitivity and a gene set considerably enriched in genes regulating TRAIL pharmacodynamics when compared to the most significant differentially expressed genes obtained from a statistical analysis framework alone. We also introduce gene expression radars, a visualization tool embedded in MA plots to assess all pairwise interactions at a glance on graphical representations of transcriptomics data. Genetrank is made available in the Structural Bioinformatics Library (https://sbl.inria.fr/doc/Genetrank-user-manual.html). It should prove useful for mining gene sets in conjunction with a signaling pathway, whenever other approaches yield relatively large sets of genes."
https://openalex.org/W4308366191,"Alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) synthesizes core fucose in N-glycans, which plays critical roles in various physiological processes. FUT8, as with many other glycosyltransferases, is a type-II membrane protein, and its large C-terminal catalytic domain is linked to the FUT8 stem region, which comprises two α-helices. Although the stem regions of several glycosyltransferases are involved in the regulation of Golgi localization, the functions of the FUT8 stem region have not been clarified as yet. Here, we found that the FUT8 stem region is essential for enzyme oligomerization. We expressed FUT8Δstem mutants, in which the stem region was replaced with glycine/serine linkers, in FUT8-KO HEK293 cells. Our immunoprecipitation and native-PAGE analysis showed that FUT8 WT formed a multimer but FUT8Δstem impaired multimer formation in the cells, although the mutants retained specific activity. In addition, the mutant protein had lower steady-state levels, increased endoplasmic reticulum localization, and a shorter half-life than FUT8 WT, suggesting that loss of the stem region destabilized the FUT8 protein. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analysis of another mutant lacking a part of the stem region revealed that the first helix in the FUT8 stem region is critical for multimer formation. Our findings demonstrated that the FUT8 stem region is essential for multimer formation but not for catalytic activity, providing insights into how the FUT8 protein matures and functions in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W4308370543,"Cytokines of the interleukin 12 (IL-12) family are assembled combinatorially from shared α and β subunits. A common theme is that human IL-12 family α subunits remain incompletely structured in isolation until they pair with a designate β subunit. Accordingly, chaperones need to support and control specific assembly processes. It remains incompletely understood, which chaperones are involved in IL-12 family biogenesis. Here, we site-specifically introduce photocrosslinking amino acids into the IL-12 and IL-23 α subunits (IL-12α and IL-23α) for stabilization of transient chaperone-client complexes for mass spectrometry. Our analysis reveals that a large set of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones interacts with IL-12α and IL-23α. Among these chaperones, we focus on protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family members and reveal IL-12 family subunits to be clients of several incompletely characterized PDIs. We find that different PDIs show selectivity for different cysteines in IL-12α and IL-23α. Despite this, PDI binding generally stabilizes unassembled IL-12α and IL-23α against degradation. In contrast, α:β assembly appears robust, and only multiple simultaneous PDI depletions reduce IL-12 secretion. Our comprehensive analysis of the IL-12/IL-23 chaperone machinery reveals a hitherto uncharacterized role for several PDIs in this process. This extends our understanding of how cells accomplish the task of specific protein assembly reactions for signaling processes. Furthermore, our findings show that cytokine secretion can be modulated by targeting specific endoplasmic reticulum chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W4308411100,"Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) has reduced HIV incidence among new-borns. However, PMTCT remains concerning in sub-Saharan Africa due to bottlenecks including viral load (VL) monitoring during pregnancy. We assessed VL coverage and materno-foetal outcomes of pregnancy among HIV-infected women within the Cameroonian context.A hospital-based study was conducted among HIV-infected mothers and their babies in three facilities of the Littoral region of Cameroon from January 2019 to May 2021. Maternal VL-coverage was monitored during pregnancy (VL&gt;1000 copies/ml or unknown were classified as MTCT high-risk group); HIV early infant diagnosis (EID) was evaluated by PCR at six-weeks after birth, and EID results were analysed according to maternal VL; p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.Of 135 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled (median [IQR] age 39 [27-37] years), VL-coverage during antenatal care (ANC) was 50.4% (68/135), with a lower VL-coverage in 2019 (37.5% vs. 61.9%, p = 0.0069). Married women vs. single (61.8% vs. 42.5%, p = 0.0275) and those on treatment before vs. during pregnancy (56.7% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.0043) had a higher VL-coverage, respectively. Among those with known VL, 10.3% (7/68) had high (VL&gt;1000 copies/mL), 22.1% (15/68) had low (50-1000 copies/mL), and 67.6% (46/68) had undetectable (&lt;50 copies/mL) VL, suggesting an overall viral suppression (&lt;1000copies/mL) of 89.7% (61/68). Vaginal delivery was 80.75% (109/135) regardless of VL, including 81.1% (59/74) women in the high-risk group. EID coverage was 88.1% (119/135) and the rate of HIV-1 MTCT was 1.68% (2/119). Both HIV-positive infants were from the high-risk group, had prolonged labour, had vaginal delivery and were breastfed.In these Cameroonian settings, VL-coverage remains suboptimal (below 90%) among ANC attendees, and women at high-risk of MTCT mainly have vaginal delivery. Viral suppression rate remains below the target (below 90%) for accelerating the elimination of MTCT. HIV-MTCT persists, and might be driven essentially by poor VL monitoring. Thus, achieving an optimal PMTCT performance requires a thorough compliance to virologic assessment during ANC."

This study utilized a multi-parametric approach to assess optimum pool size, impact of automation, and effect of nucleic acid amplification chemistries on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pooled samples for surveillance testing on the Hologic Panther Fusion® System. Dorfman pooled testing was conducted with previously tested SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal samples using Hologic's Aptima® and Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 Emergency Use Authorization assays. A manual workflow was used to generate pool sizes of 5:1 (five samples: one positive, four negative) and 10:1. An automated workflow was used to generate pool sizes of 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 8:1 and 10:1. The impact of pool size, pooling method, and assay chemistry on sensitivity, specificity, and lower limit of detection (LLOD) was evaluated. Both the Hologic Aptima® and Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assays demonstrated &gt;85% positive percent agreement between neat testing and pool sizes ≤5:1, satisfying FDA recommendation. Discordant results between neat and pooled testing were more frequent for positive samples with CT&gt;35. Fusion® CT (cycle threshold) values for pooled samples increased as expected for pool sizes of 5:1 (CT increase of 1.92-2.41) and 10:1 (CT increase of 3.03-3.29). The Fusion® assay demonstrated lower LLOD than the Aptima® assay for pooled testing (956 vs 1503 cp/mL, pool size of 5:1). Lowering the cut-off threshold of the Aptima® assay from 560 kRLU (manufacturer's setting) to 350 kRLU improved the assay sensitivity to that of the Fusion® assay for pooled testing. Both Hologic's SARS-CoV-2 assays met the FDA recommended guidelines for percent positive agreement (&gt;85%) for pool sizes ≤5:1. Automated pooling increased test throughput and enabled automated sample tracking while requiring less labor. The Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assay, which demonstrated a lower LLOD, may be more appropriate for surveillance testing."

The results showed a strong association between the spatial distribution of macroalgae in the intertidal zone and the power law model (R2 = 0.98). There was a positive association between species occurrence frequency and the spatial heterogeneity index of macroalgae species. The model also indicated there was macroalgal habitat structure at the site as the spatial heterogeneity within the community was greater than that of random distribution.

In all, we analysed data from a weighted sample of 742 young women with a history of STIs. At the univariate level, frequencies and percentages were computed, while Chi-square analysis was computed at the bivariate level. Both crude and adjusted odds ratios were computed at the multivariable level using binary logistic regression.The findings showed that the majority (72%) of the participants sought treatment for STIs. Among the participants who sought treatment for STIs (n = 532), 26% sought treatment at a public hospital/polyclinic, 34% sought treatment at a chemical/drug store and 10% self-medicated. Seeking treatment for STIs was significantly associated with older age (20-24yrs), and higher socioeconomic and educational status.This study demonstrated that majority of the young women sought treatment for STIs. Seeking treatment for STIs was influenced by socio-demographic factors. These findings have implications for sexual and reproductive health policies and interventions in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W4308412090,"Recent data highlights the presence of luck in research grant allocations, where most vulnerable are early-career researchers. The national research funding contributes typically the greatest share of total research funding in a given country, fulfilling simultaneously the roles of promoting excellence in science, and most importantly, development of the careers of young generation of scientists. Yet, there is limited supply of studies that have investigated how do early-career researchers stand compared to advanced-career level researchers in case of a national research grant system. We analyzed the Estonian national highly competitive research grant funding across different fields of research for a ten-year-period between 2013–2022, including all the awarded grants for this period (845 grants, 658 individual principal investigators, PI). The analysis was conducted separately for early-career and advanced-career researchers. We aimed to investigate how the age, scientific productivity and the previous grant success of the PI vary across a national research system, by comparing early- and advanced-career researchers. The annual grant success rates varied between 14% and 28%, and within the discipline the success rate fluctuated across years even between 0–67%. The year-to-year fluctuations in grant success were stronger for early-career researchers. The study highlights how the seniority does not automatically deliver better research performance, at some fields, younger PIs outperform older cohorts. Also, as the size of the available annual grants fluctuates remarkably, early-career researchers are most vulnerable as they can apply for the starting grant only within a limited “time window”."
https://openalex.org/W4308430053,"Background Voice messages have been employed as an effective and efficient approach for increasing health service utilization and health promotion in low- and middle-income countries. However, unlike SMS, voice message services require their users to pick up a phone call at its delivery time. Furthermore, voice messages are difficult for the users to review their contents afterward. While recognizing that voice messages are more friendly to specific groups (eg, illiterate or less literate populations), there should be several challenges in successfully operationalizing its intervention program. Objective This study is aimed to estimate the extent to which voice message service users pick up the phone calls of voice messages and complete listening up to or beyond the core part of voice messages. Methods A voice message service program composed of 14 episodes on maternal, newborn, and child health was piloted in Lagos, Nigeria, from 2018 to 2019. A voice message call of each of 14 episodes was delivered to the mobile phones of the program participants per day for 14 consecutive days. A total of 513 participants in the voice message service chose one of five locally spoken languages as the language to be used for voice messages. Two multilevel logistic regression models were created to understand participants’ adherence to the voice message: (a) Model 1 for testing whether a voice message call is picked up; and (b) Model 2 for testing whether a voice message call having been picked up is listened to up to the core messaging part. Results The greater the voice message episode number became, the smaller proportion of the participants picked up the phone calls of voice message (aOR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97–0.99; P = .01). Only 854 of 3765 voice message calls having been picked up by the participants (22.7%) were listened to up to their core message parts. It was found that picking up a phone call did not necessarily ensure listening up to the core message part. This indicates a discontinuity between these two actions. Conclusions The participants were likely to stop picking up the phone as the episode number of voice messages progressed. In view of the discontinuity between picking up a phone call and listening up to the core message part, we should not assume that those picking up the phone would automatically complete listening to the entire or core voice message."
https://openalex.org/W4308430171,"Roads fragment animal populations, vehicles kill and injure animals, and traffic may affect animal behavior. Mitigation efforts (e.g., wildlife underpasses) are constructed to prevent fragmentation and reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions. However, little is known about traffic's proximal effects on wildlife behavior and use of mitigation measures. We quantified the time that elk (Cervus elaphus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) allocated to foraging, vigilance, and flight behavior before and after vehicle passage. Both species increased vigilance and flight behaviors and reduced time spent foraging in response to vehicles. Both species were more likely to move through the underpass if they exhibited foraging behavior; we also found a marginally significant trend that animals were less likely to use the underpass after vigilance behavior. Knowledge that vehicle movement influences wildlife behavior underscores the importance of consideration given to road and crossing structure design. Additionally, findings of species-specific response to vehicle passage are important in understanding potential fitness consequences of anthropogenic disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W4308430187,"Previous studies have suggested that change-related cortical responses are phenomena similar to the onset response and could be applied to the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) paradigm. In the present study, we examined the relationship between LDAEP and the change-related response using electroencephalography findings in 50 healthy subjects. There were five conditions (55, 65, 75, 85, and 95 dB) for LDAEP and five similar conditions (abrupt sound pressure increase from 70 to 75, 80, 85, 90, and 95 dB) for the change-related response. Both the onset and abrupt sound pressure increase evoked a triphasic response with peaks at approximately 50 (P50), 100 (N100), and 200 (P200) ms. We calculated the peak-to-peak amplitudes for P50/N100 and N100/P200. Medians and slopes for P50/N100 and N100/P200 amplitudes were calculated and compared between the two measures. Results revealed a significant correlation for both the slope and median for P50/N100 ( r = 0.36, 0.37, p = 1.0 × 10 −2 , 7.9 × 10 −3 ), N100/P200 ( r = 0.40, 0.34, p = 4.0 × 10 −3 , 1.6 × 10 −2 ), and P50/N100/P200 ( r = 0.36, 0.35, p = 1.0 × 10 −2 , 1.3 × 10 −2 ).

The metabolic syndrome is a tool to identify cardiometabolic risk, but the validity of the metabolic syndrome as a clinical construct is debated. This study tested the existence of the metabolic syndrome, explored alternative cardiometabolic risk characterisations, and examined genetic and environmental factors in a South Asian population sample.Data came from the Colombo Twin and Singleton follow-up Study, which recruited twins and singletons in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2012-2015 (n = 3476). Latent class analysis tested the clustering of metabolic syndrome indicators (waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, medications, and diabetes). Regression analyses tested cross-sectional associations between the identified latent cardiometabolic classes and sociodemographic covariates and health behaviours. Structural equation modelling estimated genetic and environmental contributions to cardiometabolic risk profiles. All analyses were stratified by sex (n = 1509 men, n = 1967 women).Three classes were identified in men: 1) ""Healthy"" (52.3%), 2) ""Central obesity, high triglycerides, high fasting plasma glucose"" (40.2%), and 3) ""Central obesity, high triglycerides, diabetes"" (7.6%). Four classes were identified in women: 1) ""Healthy"" (53.2%), 2) ""Very high central obesity, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, raised fasting plasma glucose"" (32.8%), 3) ""Very high central obesity, diabetes"" (7.2%) and 4) ""Central obesity, hypertension, raised fasting plasma glucose"" (6.8%). Older age in men and women, and high socioeconomic status in men, was associated with cardiometabolic risk classes, compared to the ""Healthy"" classes. In men, individual differences in cardiometabolic class membership were due to environmental effects. In women, genetic differences predicted class membership.The findings did not support the metabolic syndrome construct. Instead, distinct clinical profiles were identified for men and women, suggesting different aetiological pathways."

It appears to result from visual cortex hyperactivity and possibly correlates with propensity to be engrossed in sensory and imaginary experiences (absorption). The prevalence and correlates of visual snow, and emotional reactions to it, were explored in the general Portuguese population with three studies with online surveys. In Study 1, 564 participants were shown an animated graphic simulation of visual snow and asked to rate how frequently they have similar percepts on a scale anchored by 0% and 100% of their waking time. They also reported their degree of distress and fascination resulting from visual snow. Absorption was measured with the Modified Tellegen Absorption Scale. 44% of respondents reported they see visual snow at least 10% of the time, and 20% reported seeing it between 80% and 100% of the time. Similar to findings in clinical samples, the frequency of visual snow correlated with tinnitus frequency and entoptic phenomena, but not with ophthalmologic problems. It was confirmed that visual snow is related to absorption. Although distress caused by visual snow was generally absent or minimal in our samples, a substantial minority (28%) reported moderate to high levels of distress. High fascination with visual snow was reported by 9%. In Studies 2 and 3, visual snow was measured by means of verbal descriptions without graphic simulation (“visual field full of tiny dots of light” and “world seen with many dots of light”, respectively). The results were similar to those in Study 1, but seeing visual snow 80%-100% of the time was less frequent (6.5% in Study 2 and 3.6% in Study 3). Visual snow has been insufficiently investigated.

The proposed approach consists of a source, a destination, relays, power beacons generating radio frequency (RF) signals for energy harvesting, and eavesdroppers. We used physical layer security associated with energy harvesting to protect data from eavesdroppers without requiring higher layer data encryption and enhance the energy consumption of wireless networks. The signal's broadcast strength must be high enough to allow for energy harvesting while being low enough to prevent eavesdropping. The process continues until the data reaches the destination. Comparing the performance of MMPS with those of conventional methods, MMPS enhanced the wireless network outage probability (OP) up to 99.7%, life time, energy consumption, protection from eavesdroppers, and more resistant to hardware impairments which increased the immunity up to 95%."

Since contemporary dietary practices are related to negative environmental impacts, this paper aims to describe a systematic review protocol to investigate the environmental footprints of food consumption by adults and elderly individuals worldwide. This protocol was developed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Search strategies and records of evidence searched in previously defined electronic databases will be defined. Original, population-based articles investigating the environmental footprints of food consumption by adults and the elderly will be included. Two independent reviewers will conduct the study selection and data extraction steps. Critical appraisal of the included studies will be based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. For data synthesis, a narrative synthesis and, if possible, also a meta-analysis will be performed. The systematic review produced from this protocol will provide evidence for data synthesis of the environmental impact through environmental footprints of food consumption of the adult and elderly population from different territories and the footprint assessment tools used around the world. Therefore, it is a gap that needs to be filled because knowing these impacts will be important to inform the development of public policies that encourage healthy and sustainable food in the face of climate and epidemiological changes.

https://openalex.org/W4308431897,"Left-right symmetry breaking in most studied vertebrates makes use of so-called leftward flow, a mechanism which was studied in detail especially in mouse and Xenopus laevis embryos and is based on rotation of monocilia on specialized epithelial surface designated as left-right organizer or laterality coordinator. However, it has been argued that prior to emergence of leftward flow an additional mechanism operates during early cleavage stages in Xenopus embryo which is based on cytoskeletal processes. Evidence in favour of this early mechanism was supported by left-right abnormalities after chemical inhibition of cytoskeletal protein formin. Here we analyzed temporal dimension of this effect in detail and found that reported abnormalities arise only after treatment at gastrula-neurula stages, i.e. just prior to and during the operation of left-right organizer. Moreover, molecular and morphological analysis of the left-right organizer reveals its abnormal development. Our results strongly indicate that left-right abnormalities reported after formin inhibition cannot serve as support of models based on early symmetry breaking event in Xenopus embryo."
https://openalex.org/W4308431913,"In the field of surface electromyography (sEMG) gesture recognition, how to improve recognition accuracy has been a research hotspot. The rapid development of deep learning provides a new solution to this problem. At present, the main applications of deep learning for sEMG gesture feature extraction are based on convolutional neural network (CNN) structures to capture spatial morphological information of the multichannel sEMG or based on long short-term memory network (LSTM) to extract time-dependent information of the single-channel sEMG. However, there are few methods to comprehensively consider the distribution area of the sEMG signal acquisition electrode sensor and the arrangement of the sEMG signal morphological features and electrode spatial features. In this paper, a novel multi-stream feature fusion network (MSFF-Net) model is proposed for sEMG gesture recognition. The model adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to learn the relationship between different muscle regions and specific gestures. Firstly, a multi-stream convolutional neural network (Multi-stream CNN) and a convolutional block attention module integrated with a resblock (ResCBAM) are used to extract multi-dimensional spatial features from signal morphology, electrode space, and feature map space. Then the learned multi-view depth features are fused by a view aggregation network consisting of an early fusion network and a late fusion network. The results of all subjects and gesture movement validation experiments in the sEMG signal acquired from 12 sensors provided by NinaPro's DB2 and DB4 sub-databases show that the proposed model in this paper has better performance in terms of gesture recognition accuracy compared with the existing models."
https://openalex.org/W4308444414,"Low-molecular-weight cyclin E (LMW-E) is an N-terminus deleted (40 amino acid) form of cyclin E detected in breast cancer, but not in normal cells or tissues. LMW-E overexpression predicts poor survival in breast cancer patients independent of tumor proliferation rate, but the oncogenic mechanism of LMW-E and its unique function(s) independent of full-length cyclin E (FL-cycE) remain unclear. In the current study, we found LMW-E was associated with genomic instability in early-stage breast tumors (n = 725) and promoted genomic instability in human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs). Mechanistically, FL-cycE overexpression inhibited the proliferation of hMECs by replication stress and DNA damage accumulation, but LMW-E facilitated replication stress tolerance by upregulating DNA replication and damage repair. Specifically, LMW-E interacted with chromatin and upregulated the loading of minichromosome maintenance complex proteins (MCMs) in a CDC6 dependent manner and promoted DNA repair in a RAD51- and C17orf53-dependent manner. Targeting the ATR-CHK1-RAD51 pathway with ATR inhibitor (ceralasertib), CHK1 inhibitor (rabusertib), or RAD51 inhibitor (B02) significantly decreased the viability of LMW-E-overexpressing hMECs and breast cancer cells. Collectively, our findings delineate a novel role for LMW-E in tumorigenesis mediated by replication stress tolerance and genomic instability, providing novel therapeutic strategies for LMW-E-overexpressing breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4308769149,"ARID1a (BAF250), a component of human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, is frequently mutated across numerous cancers, and its loss of function has been putatively linked to glucocorticoid resistance. Here, we interrogate the impact of siRNA knockdown of ARID1a compared to a functional interference approach in the HeLa human cervical cancer cell line. We report that ARID1a knockdown resulted in a significant global decrease in chromatin accessibility in ATAC-Seq analysis, as well as affecting a subset of genome-wide GR binding sites determined by analyzing GR ChIP-Seq data. Interestingly, the specific effects on gene expression were limited to a relatively small subset of glucocorticoid-regulated genes, notably those involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. The vast majority of glucocorticoid-regulated genes were largely unaffected by ARID1a knockdown or functional interference, consistent with a more specific role for ARID1a in glucocorticoid function than previously speculated. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we have identified a chromatin-associated protein complex comprising GR, ARID1a, and several DNA damage repair proteins including P53 binding protein 1 (P53BP1), Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1), DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), DNA mismatch repair protein MSH6 and splicing factor proline and glutamine-rich protein (SFPQ), as well as the histone acetyltransferase KAT7, an epigenetic regulator of steroid-dependent transcription, DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation. Not only was this protein complex ablated with both ARID1a knockdown and functional interference, but spontaneously arising DNA damage was also found to accumulate in a manner consistent with impaired DNA damage repair mechanisms. Recovery from dexamethasone-dependent cell cycle arrest was also significantly impaired. Taken together, our data demonstrate that although glucocorticoids can still promote cell cycle arrest in the absence of ARID1a, the purpose of this arrest to allow time for DNA damage repair is hindered."
