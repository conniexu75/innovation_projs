https://openalex.org/W1511922886,"Abstract Type L pyruvate kinase from rat liver has been further studied. The allosteric properties of the enzyme are strongly affected by changes in the hydrogen ion concentration of the assay medium. At pH values lower than 7, the enzyme obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to one of the substrates (phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)) and cannot be activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP). In addition, a cooperative effect of ATP is observed at a low concentration of this substrate. At pH values higher than 7.2 the enzyme has a sigmoidal response to PEP. This is transformed into a normal hyperbolic relationship in the presence of FDP and the apparent affinity of the enzyme for this substrate increases. On the other hand, ATP shows cooperative effects at low pH values, at 7.5 in the presence of 0.002 mm FDP, or at high PEP concentration (4 mm). When the enzyme kinetics was studied within a narrow physiological range of pH (6.8 to 7.25), the homotropic effect of PEP was altered, becoming more sigmoidal as the pH was increased. It is concluded that small variations in the intracellular pH could be important in the regulation of pyruvate kinase activity by metabolites in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1556700155,"Abstract Over 40 different large oligonucleotide fragments were obtained by partial digestion with taka-diastase ribonuclease T1 or spleen acid ribonuclease of 32P-labeled ribosomal 5 S RNA derived from KB cells (human epidermoid carcinoma line). The fragments were isolated by anion exchange column chromatography, further separated and purified by a second anion exchange column or by electrophoresis, and characterized after complete digestion with pancreatic ribonuclease or ribonuclease T1 by a one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis fractionation procedure. From information provided by these analyses and previous reports on oligonucleotide sequences of KB cell ribosomal 5 S RNA we derived the total nucleotide sequence of KB cell 5 S RNA. Some homology exists between the two halves of the KB cell 5 S RNA nucleotide sequence and also between the sequence of KB cell 5 S RNA and that of Escherichia coli 5 S RNA. The possible secondary structure of KB cell 5 S RNA is discussed in view of the partial splitting patterns of the RNA with ribonuclease T1."

https://openalex.org/W1538776818,"Abstract Ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase has been isolated from autotrophically cultured Rhodospirillum rubrum. The molecular weight is 120,000. The Km for ribulose 1,5-diphosphate is 83 mm, and for CO2 is 59 mm. The enzyme is inhibited by three important metabolites: citrate, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; inorganic phosphate; and 3-phosphoglyceric acid, the product of the reaction catalyzed by the carboxylase. Both the levels and the activity of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase are apparently subject to metabolic control in this facultative photoautotroph."

https://openalex.org/W1493875454,"Abstract Reaction of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) with transglutaminase in the absence of calcium ion results in losses in the transferase and hydrolysis activities of the enzyme toward the substrate, benzyloxycarbonyl-l-glutaminylglycine (Z-l-glutaminylglycine). These activities are reduced 70 to 100% by reaction with 1 to 1.5 eq of DTNB. The calcium-dependent esterase activity of transglutaminase toward p-nitrophenyl acetate is not lost by this treatment. However, the activator constant of Ca++ for this esterase activity, 1.7 x 10-3 m at pH 7, is several fold higher than that observed for the esterase activity of native enzyme. The esterase activity of DTNB-modified enzyme is not inhibited by Z-l-glutaminylglycine. This is in contrast to the effective inhibition afforded by this substrate toward the esterase activity of native transglutaminase. Z-l-Glutaminylglycine protects the enzyme against inactivation by DTNB. This protection is observed only in the presence of Ca++, which is essential for the binding of this substrate. Complete loss in transferase and hydrolysis activities is accompanied by the loss of 2 sulfhydryl residues in the enzyme and the concomitant release of 2 eq of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (or its thioquinone) for each equivalent of DTNB used for the modification. The loss in —SH groups appears to be the result of formation of a single intramolecular disulfide bridge in the enzyme. The DTNB-inactivated enzyme is readily reactivated by treatment with dithiothreitol. Peptide mapping studies show that a single —SH group of transglutaminase previously identified as essential for all catalytic activities is not a component of the disulfide bridge formed as a result of DTNB treatment. These findings suggest that the changes that occur in transglutaminase upon treatment with DTNB in the absence of Ca++ result in a loss in binding properties for glutamine substrate. In contrast to the inactivation of transglutaminase by low levels of DTNB in the absence of Ca++, inactivation of the enzyme at a high Ca++ concentration (50 mm) requires several fold higher DTNB levels. Furthermore, DTNB treatment at high Ca++ levels results in parallel losses in all three catalytic activities of the enzyme. This finding is in accord with earlier observations that a Ca++-induced conformational change in transglutaminase affects the reactivity of the enzyme protein toward modifying agents."

https://openalex.org/W1575423211,"Abstract The biosynthesis of verbenalin (I) was studied by the administration of acetate-1-14C, acetate-2-14C, mevalonate-2-14C, and geraniol-1-14C to Verbena officinalis L. plants. When I which had been formed biosynthetically from mevalonate-2-14C was degraded, randomization of the label between carbon atoms 6 and 9 was not observed; carbon atom 6 retained most of the radioactivity in young and old plants. Randomization between carbon atoms 3 and 8 varied with age of plant. There was complete randomization in young plants, limited randomization in older plants, and essentially nonrandomization in senile plants. The percentage of radioactivity in carbon atom 3 predominated over that in carbon atom 8 as the plant age increased. The ratio of radioactivity found in aglucone to that in glucose is considered to be metabolically significant."
