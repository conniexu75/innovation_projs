Hence, enzymes involved in its synthesis possess many layers of regulation to achieve balanced cholesterol levels. 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) is the terminal enzyme of cholesterol synthesis in the Kandutsch-Russell pathway, converting 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to cholesterol. In the absence of functional DHCR7, accumulation of 7DHC and a lack of cholesterol production leads to the devastating developmental disorder, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. This study identifies that statin treatment can ameliorate the low DHCR7 expression seen with common Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome mutations. Furthermore, we show that wild-type DHCR7 is also relatively labile. In an example of end-product inhibition, cholesterol accelerates the proteasomal degradation of DHCR7, resulting in decreased protein levels and activity. The loss of enzymatic activity results in the accumulation of the substrate 7DHC, which leads to an increased production of vitamin D. Thus, these findings highlight DHCR7 as an important regulatory switch between cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis.

Cholesterol is an essential molecule for life in higher organisms, but too much or too little can lead to disease. Its synthesis requires a complex series of reactions that involves >20 steps, which must be tightly controlled to balance cholesterol levels. Here, we focus on the post-translational regulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), 2The abbreviations used are: DHCR77-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) reductaseDHCR2424-dehydrocholesterol reductaseHMGCR3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductaseSLOSSmith-Lemli-Opitz syndromeSMsqualene monooxygenaseSREBPsterol-regulatory element-binding proteinUVBultraviolet BCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrin. the terminal enzyme in the Kandutsch-Russell pathway of cholesterol synthesis (1.Kandutsch A.A.

The alternative terminal enzyme in the Bloch pathway of cholesterol synthesis is 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) (3.Bloch K. The biological synthesis of cholesterol.Science. 1965; 150: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Despite a certain level of redundancy, both the Kandutsch-Russell and Bloch pathways are utilized in different cellular contexts, and are both essential for cell survival (2.Mitsche M.A. McDonald J.G.

DHCR7 acts by reducing the C(7–8) double bond of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to form cholesterol. A lack of functional DHCR7 results in an accumulation of 7DHC and reduced cholesterol synthesis, resulting in the devastating developmental disorder Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) (4.Smith D.W.

The incidence of SLOS reportedly ranges between 1 in 10,000 to 70,000 in different populations, with a carrier rate of approximately one percent for pathogenic mutations of SLOS (7.Cross J.L. Iben J.

Although the disorder was first identified 50 years ago (4.Smith D.W. Lemli L. Opitz J.M. A newly recognized syndrome of multiple congenital anomalies.J.

This reaction is catalyzed by ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation of the skin (Fig. 1A) and represents the major source of vitamin D in humans. Vitamin D is best known for its role in calcium homeostasis and skeletal health, but its deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, type II diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality (9.Hossein-nezhad A.

With an increasing number of individuals placed on vitamin D supplements despite little evidence of their success in preventing chronic disease (10.Afzal S. Brøndum-Jacobsen P. Bojesen S.E.

Holvik K. Lips P. Should vitamin D supplements be recommended to prevent chronic diseases?.BMJ. 2015; 350: h321Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), there needs to be a greater understanding of how vitamin D synthesis is regulated. Through genome-wide association studies, genetic variants in DHCR7 have been identified as strong determinants of circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a marker of vitamin D status (13.Wang T.J. Zhang F. Richards J.B. Kestenbaum B. van Meurs J.B. Berry D. Kiel D.P. Streeten E.A. Ohlsson C. Koller D.L. Peltonen L. Cooper J.D. O'Reilly P.F. Houston D.K.

Horst R. et al.Genome-wide association study of circulating vitamin D levels.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 2739-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Thus, examining DHCR7 regulation will provide insights into both vitamin D and cholesterol synthesis. The rate-limiting steps of cholesterol synthesis are catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) and squalene monooxygenase (SM), which are both rapidly turned over in response to sterol triggers (15.Rodwell V.W. Nordstrom J.L. Mitschelen J.J. Regulation of HMG-CoA reductase.Adv. Lipid Res. 1976; 14: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J. Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 260-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast, DHCR24 protein appears relatively stable (17.Luu W. Zerenturk E.J. Kristiana I. Bucknall M.P. Sharpe L.J. Brown A.J. Signaling regulates activity of DHCR24, the final enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2014; 55: 410-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because DHCR7 and DHCR24 are regulated similarly at the transcriptional level via sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) (18.Prabhu A.V. Sharpe L.J. Brown A.J. The sterol-based transcriptional control of human 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7): evidence of a cooperative regulatory program in cholesterol synthesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1842: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it is possible that these two alternative terminal enzymes differ at the post-translational level, providing differential regulation of the two pathways. Here, we report for the first time that DHCR7 is rapidly degraded proteasomally in response to cholesterol, which switches flux from cholesterol toward vitamin D synthesis. CHO-7 and SRD-1 cell lines (gifts of Drs. Goldstein, Brown, and DeBose-Boyd, University of Texas Southwestern) and HaCaT cells (gift of Dr. Mason, University of Sydney, Australia) were used. HEK-293 cells stably overexpressing SM-N100-GFP-V5 (16.Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J. Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 260-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and CHO-7 cells stably overexpressing DHCR24-V5 (CHO-DHCR24) (19.Zerenturk E.J. Kristiana I. Gill S. Brown A.J. The endogenous regulator 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol inhibits cholesterol synthesis at DHCR24 (Seladin-1).Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were generated previously. HEK-293 or CHO-7 cells stably overexpressing DHCR7-myc (HEK-DHCR7 or CHO-DHCR7, respectively) were similarly generated for this study. HEK-293 and HaCaT cell lines were maintained in DMEM HG medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and CHO cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 5% (v/v) newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum. Cells were seeded at a density of 4.5 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate, transfected the following day, and treated the next day. Sterol intermediates were complexed to the carrier methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) (20.Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cholesterol addition to ER membranes alters conformation of SCAP, the SREBP escort protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Treatments were performed in sterol-depleted media that contained the statin compactin (5 μm). All statin treatments were supplemented with mevalonate (50 μm). HEK-SM-N100-GFP-V5 cells were additionally pretreated overnight in the treatment media, as performed previously (16.Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J. Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 260-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). HEK-293 and HaCaT cell lines were treated in DMEM HG media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf lipoprotein-deficient serum. The protein-coding sequence of human DHCR7 (NM_001360.2) was cloned from cDNA into pGEM T-easy (Promega) and subcloned into pcDNA4 (Life Technologies) with a C-terminal V5-epitope tag and into pcDNA5-FRT (Life Technologies) with a C-terminal myc tag that was used previously (21.Luu W.

Lipid Res. 2015; 56: 888-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA4-DHCR7-V5 was used as the template to generate amino acid mutations via site-directed mutagenesis, whereas pcDNA5-DHCR7-myc-FRT was used to create the stable cell lines for this study. Primer sequences are available upon request. HEK-293 cells were seeded, and DHCR7 plasmids were transfected the next day for 24 h with 1 μg of DNA to 2 μl of TransIT-2020 reagent (Mirus Bio). Similarly, CHO-DHCR24-V5 cells were transfected with the DHCR7-myc plasmid for 4 h with 1 μg of DNA to 4 μl of Lipofectamine LTX transfection reagent (Life Technologies). Cells were treated the following day as indicated in the figure legends. For siRNA transfections, HEK-DHCR7 or CHO-DHCR7 cells were transfected for 24 h with 25 nm siRNA using 5 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Life Technologies). Then cells were harvested for quantitative real-time-PCR or treated as indicated in the figure legends. After plasmid or siRNA transfection, total RNA was harvested using Tri Reagent and reverse transcribed to cDNA using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase. Gene expression levels of Insig-1, Insig-2, and DHCR7 were determined and normalized to the housekeeping gene porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). Primer sequences for PBGD have been published previously (22.Kielar D. Dietmaier W. Langmann T. Aslanidis C. Probst M. Naruszewicz M. Schmitz G.

Insig-1 primer sequences were CGCCTGTTGCAGAGGAGCC (forward) and CGAGGTGACTGTCGATACAGGG (reverse), Insig-2 primers were CGCTCTTTCCACCTGATGTG (forward) and CAGTCCAATGGATAGTGCAGCC (reverse), and DHCR7 primers were CACCGGCCGTGCTAGTCTGG (forward) and CAGGCTTGTAGCCCGTTCACCTC (reverse). Protein was harvested in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, as described previously (24.Faulkner R.A. Nguyen A.D. Jo Y. DeBose-Boyd R.A.

Protein concentrations were measured and normalized using BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and all samples were equally loaded for 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel separation. Samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and equal loading was confirmed with Ponceau S stain. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk and probed with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-myc (1:5000 dilution in 0.5% BSA; Santa Cruz, catalog no. SC-40, lot no. A2814), mouse anti-V5 (1:5000 dilution in 5% skim milk; Life Technologies, catalog no.

T5168, lot no. 072M4809). Membranes were then visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system using the ImageQuant LAS 500 (GE Healthcare). Protein band intensities from Western blots were quantified by densitometry using Image Studio Lite (version 4.0). Locations of molecular weight standards are indicated on the blots. Cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends with 2 μg/ml [2H7]7DHC (Avanti Lipids) complexed to CD for 2 h. If required, cells were treated with UVB, then harvested, and protein was normalized before adding 0.3 μg of 5α-cholestane as an internal standard for GC/MS. Lysates were processed in ethanol, with 10 μm butylated hydroxytoluene and 200 μm EDTA. Lipids were extracted, derivatized, and analyzed in selective ion monitoring mode using a Thermo Trace gas chromatograph coupled with a Thermo DSQII mass spectrometer and Thermo Triplus autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and data were processed with Thermo Xcalibur Software (Version 2.1.0.1140) as described previously (17.Luu W. Zerenturk E.J. Kristiana I. Bucknall M.P. Sharpe L.J. Brown A.J. Signaling regulates activity of DHCR24, the final enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2014; 55: 410-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sterols monitored are detailed in Table 1. Quantification of DHCR7 activity or rate of vitamin D production was based on chromatographic peak areas measured for [2H7]cholesterol relative to [2H7]7DHC or [2H7]vitamin D, respectively.TABLE 1Retention times and ion m/z values monitored in selective ion monitoring mode during gas chromatography/mass spectrometryCompoundRetention timeQuantification/confirmation ion (m/z)Molecular ion (m/z)min5α-Cholestane28.0217372[2H7]Cholesterol33.5336465[2H7]7DHC35.5358463[2H7]Vitamin D30.0358463 Open table in a new tab Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined by Student's paired t test (two-tailed), where p values of ≤0.05 (*) and ≤0.01 (**) were considered statistically significant. First, we compared the protein stability of DHCR7 and DHCR24 using CHO-7 cells stably overexpressing DHCR24-V5(19.Zerenturk E.J. Kristiana I. Gill S. Brown A.J. The endogenous regulator 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol inhibits cholesterol synthesis at DHCR24 (Seladin-1).Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We transiently transfected these cells with DHCR7-myc and treated them with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide to study protein turnover. Although DHCR24 protein expression remained stable for 8 h, DHCR7 turnover was rapid (Fig. 1B). Because cholesterol is produced by DHCR7, we considered whether end-product inhibition occurred. Therefore, we treated cells overexpressing DHCR7 with cholesterol and found that DHCR7 protein expression was indeed reduced by cholesterol treatment in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A), consistent with end-product-mediated degradation. Although basal turnover of DHCR7 was very rapid with cycloheximide alone (Fig. 2B), cholesterol treatment further accelerated its degradation (Fig. 2, A and B). A version of DHCR7 tagged at the N terminus was similarly degraded at 8 h (data not shown). Next we used SRD-1 cells (25.Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Sterol-resistant transcription in CHO cells caused by gene rearrangement that truncates SREBP-2.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a CHO mutant cell line that lacks SREBP-mediated transcriptional regulation, to ensure that the observed effects were post-translational. To measure DHCR7 activity, we metabolically labeled cells with deuterated 7DHC ([2H7]7DHC) and determined conversion to [2H7]cholesterol by GC/MS as we have done previously (21.Luu W. Hart-Smith G. Sharpe L.J. Brown A.J. The terminal enzymes of cholesterol synthesis, DHCR24 and DHCR7, interact physically and functionally.J. Lipid Res. 2015; 56: 888-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A and B). In the absence of an effective endogenous DHCR7 antibody, this confirmed that the decreased protein levels also resulted in a decrease in DHCR7 activity. Our findings show that cholesterol treatment decreased DHCR7 activity by 50% (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, DHCR7 mRNA levels remained stable after cholesterol treatment in SRD-1 cells (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that cholesterol stimulates a decrease in DHCR7 protein at the post-translational level, which also caused a decrease in DHCR7 activity. Next, we tested desmosterol, the product of DHCR7 in the Bloch pathway, and found that it also reduced DHCR7 protein levels (Fig. 4A). Conversely, overnight statin pretreatment, which was used to lower sterol status, resulted in higher basal expression of DHCR7 (Fig. 4A). HMGCR and SM have distinct sterol response profiles, with SM degradation induced by cholesterol and desmosterol (16.Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J. Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 260-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), whereas HMGCR responds to earlier intermediates, such as 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, and the oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, oxysterols (26.Lange Y. Ory D.S. Ye J. Lanier M.H. Hsu F.-F. Steck T.L. Effectors of rapid homeostatic responses of endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase.J. Biol.

Insig-mediated degradation of HMG CoA reductase stimulated by lanosterol, an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol.Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We predicted DHCR7 to be degraded similarly to SM in response to sterol products in the pathway. Having shown that both cholesterol and desmosterol accelerate DHCR7 protein degradation, we further investigated sterol specificity by testing a selection of sterol pathway intermediates. There was little sterol specificity with most intermediates causing some decrease in DHCR7 levels (Fig. 4, B and C) and with later products in the pathway tending to display a higher propensity to trigger degradation. Additionally, oxysterols were tested at concentrations shown to degrade HMGCR (28.Zelcer N. Sharpe L.J. Loregger A. Kristiana I. Cook E.C. Phan L. Stevenson J. Brown A.J. The E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 degrades squalene monooxygenase and affects 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase and the cholesterol synthesis pathway.Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 34: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Side-chain oxysterols, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol, induce HMGCR degradation (29.Song B.-L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Ubiquitination of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in permeabilized cells mediated by cytosolic E1 and a putative membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28798-28806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas steroid-ring oxysterols can induce SM degradation (16.Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J. Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 260-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Again, we predicted that DHCR7 would follow a similar pattern to SM but found that most oxysterols had no effect. Only 7-ketocholesterol, which can be generated enzymatically from 7DHC (30.Shinkyo R. Xu L. Tallman K.A. Cheng Q. Porter N.A. Guengerich F.P. Conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to 7-ketocholesterol is catalyzed by human cytochrome P450 7A1 and occurs by direct oxidation without an epoxide intermediate.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 33021-33028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), significantly decreased DHCR7 levels, albeit to a lesser extent than cholesterol (Fig. 4, D and E). Although DHCR7 is relatively labile and sensitive to degradation via a number of sterol triggers, we focused on the relationship between DHCR7 and cholesterol as it is the most physiologically abundant sterol (31.McDonald J.G. Smith D.D. Stiles A.R. Russell D.W. A comprehensive method for extraction and quantitative analysis of sterols and secosteroids from human plasma.J. Lipid Res. 2012; 53: 1399-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and therefore, any measurable effects within cells are likely to be largely caused by cholesterol. There are at least two ways that DHCR7 may respond to increased cholesterol: first, via a predicted sterol-sensing domain (32.Bae S.H. Lee J.N. Fitzky B.U. Seong J. Paik Y.K. Cholesterol biosynthesis from lanosterol: molecular cloning, tissue distribution, expression, chromosomal localization, and regulation of rat 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, a Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome-related protein.J.

The sterol-sensing domain: multiple families, a unique role?.Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and second, by interacting with putative cholesterol-binding sites (34.Li X. Roberti R. Blobel G. Structure of an integral membrane sterol reductase from Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum.Nature. 2015; 517: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In HMGCR, crucial residues were identified in the enzyme's sterol-sensing domain, which must bind to the endoplasmic reticulum retention protein Insig to induce HMGCR degradation (35.Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Accelerated degradation of HMG CoA reductase mediated by binding of insig-1 to its sterol-sensing domain.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). DHCR7 has been proposed to contain a sterol-sensing domain (32.Bae S.H. Lee J.N. Fitzky B.U. Seong J. Paik Y.K. Cholesterol biosynthesis from lanosterol: molecular cloning, tissue distribution, expression, chromosomal localization, and regulation of rat 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, a Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome-related protein.J.

To examine if a similar process occurs in the sterol-mediated degradation of DHCR7, we used specific siRNA to knock down both isoforms of Insig (Fig. 5A). Because cholesterol regulation remained after Insig knockdown (Fig. 5A), this indicates that Insig is not required in the cholesterol-mediated degradation of DHCR7. Alternatively, mutations of other residues in DHCR7 may confer resistance to cholesterol-mediated degradation. Two cholesterol-binding sites (tyrosine 280 and aspartic acid 411) were recently predicted through solving the crystal structure of a Δ(14)-sterol reductase that is a homologue of human DHCR7 found in the methanotrophic bacterium Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z (34.Li X. Roberti R. Blobel G. Structure of an integral membrane sterol reductase from Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum.Nature. 2015; 517: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we mutated these residues both singly and together to determine their importance in the degradation of DHCR7. A loss of cholesterol-mediated regulation in these mutants would imply that cholesterol may directly bind to these sites to induce DHCR7 degradation. Despite similar transcript levels indicating equal transfection rates (Fig. 5B), both conservative (Y280F; D411N) and non-conservative mutations (Y280C; D411A) tended to display lower protein expression (Fig. 5C), suggesting that DHCR7 is easily destabilized. The mutant Y280C also represents a mutation identified in SLOS patients (36.Prasad C. Marles S. Prasad A.N. Nikkel S. Longstaffe S. Peabody D. Eng B. Wright S. Waye J.S. Nowaczyk M.J.

All mutants maintained regulation by cholesterol (Fig. 5C), suggesting that these sites are not responsible for the cholesterol-mediated degradation of DHCR7. Conside"

Living as a commensal, Saccharomyces cerevisiae could potentially shape the immune response in a significant way. We observed that S. cerevisiae cells induce trained immunity in monocytes in a strain-dependent manner through enhanced TNFα and IL-6 production upon secondary stimulation with TLR ligands, as well as bacterial and fungal commensals. Differential chitin content accounts for the differences in training properties observed among strains, driving induction of trained immunity by increasing cytokine production and direct antimicrobial activity both in vitro and in vivo. These chitin-induced protective properties are intimately associated with its internalization, identifying a critical role of phagosome acidification to facilitate microbial digestion. This study reveals how commensal and passenger microorganisms could be important in promoting health and preventing mucosal diseases by modulating host defense toward pathogens and thus influencing the host microbiota-immune system interactions.

Aggregation of TDP-43 to amyloid-like fibrils and spreading of the aggregates are suggested to account for the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of TDP-43 aggregation, we attempted to identify the amino acid sequence required for the aggregation. By expressing a series of deletion mutants lacking 20 amino acid residues in the C-terminal region in SH-SY5Y cells, we established that residues 274–313 in the glycine-rich region are essential for aggregation. In vitro aggregation experiments using synthetic peptides of 40 amino acids from this sequence and adjacent regions showed that peptides 274–313 and 314–353 formed amyloid-like fibrils. Transduction of these fibrils induced seed-dependent aggregation of TDP-43 in cells expressing wild-type TDP-43 or TDP-43 lacking nuclear localization signal. These cells showed different phosphorylated C-terminal fragments of TDP-43 and different trypsin-resistant bands. These results suggest that residues 274–353 are responsible for the conversion of TDP-43 to amyloid-like fibrils and that templated aggregation of TDP-43 by seeding with different peptides induces various types of TDP-43 pathologies, i.e. the peptides appear to act like prion strains.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration. In 2006, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) was identified as the major component of tau-negative, ubiquitin-positive inclusions in these diseases (1.Arai T. Hasegawa M. Akiyama H. Ikeda K.

TDP-43 is a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein of 414 amino acids, originally identified as a transcriptional repressor that binds to the transactivation-responsive region of the HIV-1 gene (3.Ou S.H.

It is expressed ubiquitously and is localized mainly in nuclei, functioning in exon splicing, gene transcription, regulation of mRNA stability and biosynthesis, and the formation of nuclear bodies. For example, it has been reported that TDP-43 binds to the junctional region between exons 9 and 10 of the gene coding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and causes skipping of exon 9 (4.Buratti E.

Importantly, most of the mutations are localized in the carboxyl-third of the molecule, which shows sequence similarity to prion proteins. Furthermore, biochemical and histological analyses demonstrated accumulation of full-length and C-terminal fragments (CTFs) in hyperphosphorylated and fibrillar forms in brain and spinal cord of patients (13.Hasegawa M.

Furthermore, the CTF-banding patterns are different between the diseases and are closely related to the neuropathological phenotypes, which can be classified into at least four groups (types A–D) (13.Hasegawa M.

The CTF-banding patterns are considered to reflect the protease resistance of the assembled protein structures (15.Tsuji H. Arai T. Kametani F. Nonaka T. Yamashita M. Suzukake M. Hosokawa M. Yoshida M. Hatsuta H. Takao M. Saito Y. Murayama S. Akiyama H. Hasegawa M. Mann D.M. Tamaoka A. Molecular analysis and biochemical classification of TDP-43 proteinopathy.Brain. 2012; 135: 3380-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that the pathological TDP-43 has prion-like activity and can convert normal TDP-43 to an abnormal form in cultured cells (16.Nonaka T. Masuda-Suzukake M. Arai T. Hasegawa Y. Akatsu H. Obi T. Yoshida M. Murayama S. Mann D.M. Akiyama H. Hasegawa M.

Interestingly, the CTF-banding patterns of converted host proteins resemble those of the pathological TDP-43 used as seeds, suggesting that the conversion is template-dependent. These findings strongly suggest that aggregation of C-terminal regions of TDP-43 plays a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of ALS and FTLD with TDP-43 pathologies (FTLD-TDP). The aggregation of CTFs of TDP-43 has also been demonstrated in experimental cellular models; for example, our previous study showed that expression of CTF(162–414) of TDP-43 with a GFP tag in SH-SY5Y cells induced cytosolic mislocalization of TDP-43 in phosphorylated and ubiquitinated aggregates, recapitulating the TDP-43 pathology in brains (17.Nonaka T. Kametani F. Arai T. Akiyama H. Hasegawa M. Truncation and pathogenic mutations facilitate the formation of intracellular aggregates of TDP-43.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated aggregation of TDP-43 in cultured cells expressing a series of deletion constructs to identify the sequences responsible for the aggregation. Then, self-aggregation of synthetic peptides derived from the identified sequence and surrounding sequences was examined. Synthetic fibrillar aggregates of peptides from the identified sequence were found to work as seeds, converting normal TDP-43 into abnormal aggregates in cultured cells. To construct a series of deletion mutants lacking sequences of 20-amino acid residues in TDP-CTF with a GFP tag, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis of pEGFP-TDP(162–414) (17.Nonaka T. Kametani F.

Deletion mutants lacking 40 amino acid residues were also constructed from GFP-tagged TDP-CTF(162–414), full-length TDP-43, and TDP-43(ΔNLS(187–192)). Twenty amino acid-long deletions of Del 2, 4, and 5 were induced in pEGFP-TDP(162–414), pcDNA3-TDP-43, and pcDNA3-TDP-43(ΔNLS(187–192)) (18.Nonaka T. Arai T. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Akiyama H.

As secondary antibodies, biotin-labeled secondary antibody was purchased from Vector Laboratories for use in the avidin-biotin complex method, and goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugate was obtained from Bio-Rad for use in the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method. SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acid solution (Gibco), and penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Gibco). Cells were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in a culture chamber. Cells were grown to 50% confluence in six-well culture dishes, and transfection of expression plasmids into cells was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in six-well plates for the indicated time and harvested in A68 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.8 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA) containing 1% Sarkosyl (Sar). Cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 25 °C, and the supernatant was recovered as the Sar-soluble fraction. The remaining pellets were lysed in SDS-sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min to prepare the Sar-insoluble fraction. The Sar-insoluble fraction was also prepared from brains of patients with FTLD or ALS as described (13.Hasegawa M. Arai T. Nonaka T. Kametani F. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y. Beach T.G. Buratti E. Baralle F. Morita M. Nakano I. Oda T. Tsuchiya K. Akiyama H. Phosphorylated TDP-43 in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Ann. Neurol. 2008; 64: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion of the Sar-insoluble fraction was performed by incubation in 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.01 mg/ml trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min. Protein concentration was estimated using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples were loaded on SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gels electrophoresed with the Tris-glycine buffer system. Proteins in gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 3% gelatin. The blots were incubated overnight with the indicated primary antibodies in 10% calf serum at an appropriate dilution (1:1000–5000) at room temperature. Membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h with a biotin-labeled secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) or a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) at room temperature. Signals were detected using an avidin-biotin complex staining kit (Vector Laboratories) or ECL Prime Western blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare). SH-SY5Y cells transfected with expression plasmids were grown on 35-mm glass dishes (Iwaki) for 2 days. To observe intracellular aggregates of GFP-tagged TDP-CTF (they show intense fluorescence of GFP), cells were examined with a fluorescence microscope (DIAPHOTO, Nikon) set at 488 nm. Quantitation of aggregate formation was performed as follows; nine images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (BioZero, KEYENCE), using a sliding field of view. The nine images were combined to form a single image using BZ-2 Analyzer (KEYENCE) and luminance extraction was conducted to quantify the fluorescence of aggregates in the image. The lower limit threshold of luminance for extraction was adjusted to exclude the fluorescence of non-aggregated protein (which is weaker than that of aggregated protein), so that only luminance of aggregated TDP-CTF was detected and quantified. Synthetic 40-mer peptides with the following partial sequences of TDP-43 (234–273, FADDQIAQSLCGEDLIIKGISVHISNAEPKHNSNRQLERS; 274–313, GRFGGNPGGFGNQGGFGNSRGGGAGLGNNQGSNMGGGMNF; 314–353, GAFSINPAMMAAAQAALQSSWGMMGMLASQQNQSGPSGNN; and 353–392, QNQGNMQREPNQAFGSGNNSYSGSNSGAAIGWGSASNAGS) and control generated randomly (NHYVKMILKKALSRYPNRRNLPCVDLRYKRKSIILQRKYS) were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to the indicated concentrations. These peptide solutions were incubated on a shaker at 37 °C, and 10-μl aliquots were added to 300 μl of 20 mm MOPS buffer containing 5 μm thioflavin S at the indicated time. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 200-μl aliquots were loaded on a 96-well black plate, and fluorescence of thioflavin S (λex = 436 nm and λem = 535 nm) was measured using a luminescence plate reader (Chameleon, HIDEX). For electron microscopy, peptide solutions were incubated on a shaker for 8 days, placed on collodion-coated 300-mesh copper grids, and stained with 2% (v/v) phosphotungstate. Micrographs were recorded on a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope. Aliquots of 100 μl of TDP-43 peptide solutions were incubated for 8 days on a shaker, diluted with 500 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the remaining pellets (peptide fibrils) were dissolved in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Aliquots of 5 μl of peptide fibril solution were added to 95 μl of 6 m guanidine HCl solution, and peptide fibrils were quantified by means of HPLC. For introduction into cells, 5 μg of peptide fibrils was mixed with 120 μl of Opti-MEM, and 62.5 μl of Multifectam (Promega) was added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 62.5 μl of Opti-MEM was added. The mixture was further incubated for 5 min and added to cells immediately after transfection of expression plasmids of TDP-43. The treated cells were further incubated for 2 days in a CO2 incubator. Transfection of expression plasmids and induction of peptide fibrils were conducted as described above, using SH-SY5Y cells grown on coverslips. After incubation for 2 days in a CO2 incubator, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the indicated primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution. After incubation for 1 h, cells were washed and treated with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated Alexa-568 and anti-mouse IgG-conjugated Alexa-488, Invitrogen) and TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen) to counterstain nuclear DNA. After 1 h, the cells were mounted and analyzed using an LSM5 Pascal confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cell death assays were conducted using a CytoTox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega). All values in figures are means ± S.E. Biochemical data were statistically analyzed using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine the sequences responsible for aggregation of CTFs of TDP-43, we constructed a series of deletion mutants lacking 20-amino acid residues in TDP-CTF with a GFP tag: Del 1(Δ214–233); Del 2(Δ234–253); Del 3(Δ254–273); Del 4(Δ274–293); Del 5(Δ294–313); Del 6(Δ314–333); Del 7(Δ334–353); Del 8(Δ354–373); and Del 9(Δ374–393) (Fig. 1, A and B). Aggregation of TDP-43 in cells transfected with a deletion or wild-type construct was evaluated by biochemical analysis of Sar-insoluble TDP-43 (Fig. 2). The Sar-soluble TDP-43 CTF levels were similar among the deletions as detected with anti-GFP (Fig. 2, left panel), but remarkable decreases of Sar-insoluble TDP-43 were detected with anti-GFP or pS409/410 in cells expressing Del 4, 5, or 8 (Fig. 2, middle and right panels). The results of band quantitation are shown in the lower panels. These data suggest that deletion of residues 274–293, 294–313, or 354–373 reduced the TDP-43 aggregation.FIGURE 2Immunoblot analysis of Sar-insoluble fraction of cells expressing TDP-CTF deletion mutants. After 48 h of incubation, SH-SY5Y cells transfected with TDP-CTF deletion mutants and WT (without deletion) were lysed in A68 buffer containing 1% Sar and sequentially fractionated into Sar-soluble (sup, supernatant) and Sar-insoluble (ppt, pellet) by centrifugation. These fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins in gels were transferred to PVDF membrane. Bands were detected with anti-GFP and anti-pS409/410 antibodies, and relative intensity (versus WT) is shown in the plot. Data are means ± S.E. (n = 3). *, p < 0.05 by Student's t test against the value of WT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Aggregation of the deletion mutants of TDP-43 was also evaluated by means of fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). In cells expressing Del 1, 2, or 3, many small dot-like aggregates were observed, which were morphologically distinct from those in cells expressing wild-type CTF. In contrast, only small amounts of TDP-43 aggregates, or none, were observed in cells expressing Del 4–8, compared with those in cells expressing wild-type or Del 9. Intracellular aggregates of GFP-tagged TDP-43 CTF had much more intense fluorescence than diffusely expressed non-aggregated GFP-tagged TDP-43 CTF. Therefore, to quantify TDP-43 aggregates by luminance extraction, we adjusted the lower limit (threshold) of luminance value so that only the aggregates were detected. As shown in Fig. 3B, markedly reduced aggregate formation was observed in cells expressing Del 4–8, confirming the visual observations. These results indicate that sequences in the region between 274 and 373 are responsible for the aggregation of TDP-CTF, although there is some discrepancy between the results of these morphological observations and those of biochemical analyses shown in Fig. 2. It is possible that amorphous aggregates, which are different from the amyloid-like aggregates, but are nevertheless insoluble and phosphorylated, are formed in cells due to deletion of the sequence 314–353. Such aggregates might be diffusely localized in the cytoplasm of cells and would not be detected as aggregates by fluorescence microscopy. To further analyze the effect of these sequences on TDP-43 aggregation, we constructed another series of deletion mutants lacking 40 amino acid residues in GFP-tagged TDP-CTF and an untagged full-length TDP-43 mutant (ΔNLS(187–192)), which lacks both the NLS (78–84) and a similar sequence (187–192), and forms aggregates in cells (18.Nonaka T. Arai T. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Akiyama H. Hasegawa M. Phosphorylated and ubiquitinated TDP-43 pathological inclusions in ALS and FTLD-U are recapitulated in SH-SY5Y cells.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Remarkable reduction of aggregation was observed both biochemically and morphologically in cells expressing the Del 4 and Del 5 mutants described above. The sequences deleted in these mutants correspond to the glycine-rich region of TDP-43. Therefore, 40-amino acid deletion constructs were made by deleting Del 4–5 and the adjacent Del 2–3, Del 6–7, and Del 8–9. They were expressed in cells, and aggregate formation was investigated by quantitation of Sar-insoluble TDP-43 (Fig. 4). Deletion of residues 234–273 (Del 2–3) in GFP-CTF caused a significant increase of Sar-insoluble phosphorylated TDP-43. In contrast, insoluble TDP-43 was dramatically reduced by deletion of residues 274–313 (Del 4–5), although no reduction was detected in response to deletion of residues 314–353 (Fig. 4A). Deletion of residues 354–393 (Del 8–9) also showed significant reduction of insoluble TDP-43 on the blot with pS409/410 but not with anti-GFP antibody. Similar results were observed in a cellular aggregation model using untagged full-length mutant (ΔNLS(187–192)) (Fig. 4B), suggesting that residues 274–313 and 354–393 are important for aggregation of not only CTF but also full-length TDP-43. Aggregate formation of these deletion mutants was also investigated by means of fluorescence microscopy. In cells expressing undeleted GFP-tagged CTF, Del 2–3(234–273), and Del 8–9(354–393), distinct aggregates were observed, whereas diffuse cytoplasmic localization of GFP was observed in cells expressing Del 4–5(274–313) or Del 6–7(314–353). The results of quantitation of aggregates (Fig. 4, C and D) suggested that residues 314–353 may also be important for aggregation of TDP-CTF. Next, we investigated whether or not these 40 amino acid peptides can themselves form amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates. Synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences 234–273, 274–313, 314–353, and 353–392 of TDP-43 and a control peptide (Fig. 5A) were dissolved in 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer at various concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mm), and incubated at 37 ° C with shaking. Amyloid-like aggregate formation was analyzed in terms of thioflavin S (ThS) fluorescence. The peptide 234–273 showed an increase of ThS fluorescence at day 4 at a concentration of 0.2 mm, but no increase was observed even by day 8 at lower concentrations. In contrast, the peptides 274–313 and 314–353 showed markedly increased ThS fluorescence at day 1 at most concentrations studied (Fig. 5B). No ThS increase was observed with the peptide 353–392 or the control peptide. The amyloid-like aggregates formed by the above peptides at a concentration of 0.2 mm were negatively stained with phosphotungstate on a grid and observed by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5C, short fibrillar aggregates were observed in the peptide 234–273 solution. In contrast, relatively long, straight, or twisted fibrils (10–15 nm diameter) were observed in the 274–313 and 314–353 peptide solutions. These results indicate that the TDP-43 peptides 274–313 and 314–353 have a high propensity to form amyloid-like fibrils, whereas 234–273 and 354–393 peptides have a low propensity.

While spiking during ripples has been extensively studied, our understanding of the subthreshold behavior of hippocampal neurons during these events remains incomplete. Here, we combine in vivo whole-cell and multisite extracellular recordings to characterize the membrane potential dynamics of identified CA1 pyramidal neurons during ripples. We find that the subthreshold depolarization during ripples is uncorrelated with the net excitatory input to CA1, while the post-ripple hyperpolarization varies proportionately. This clarifies the circuit mechanism keeping most neurons silent during ripples. On a finer timescale, the phase delay between intracellular and extracellular ripple oscillations varies systematically with membrane potential. Such smoothly varying delays are inconsistent with models of intracellular ripple generation involving perisomatic inhibition alone. Instead, they suggest that ripple-frequency excitation leading inhibition shapes intracellular ripple oscillations."

This study explores the extent to which portable Immersive Virtual Reality technology can help us gain an accurate understanding of the factors that influence a doctor’s response to the ethical challenge underlying such tenacious requests for antibiotics (given the threat posed by growing anti-bacterial resistance worldwide). It also considers the potential of such technology to train doctors to face such dilemmas. Experiment Twelve experienced GPs and nine trainees were confronted with an increasingly angry demand by a woman to prescribe antibiotics to her mother in the face of inconclusive evidence that such antibiotic prescription is necessary. The daughter and mother were virtual characters displayed in immersive virtual reality. The specific purposes of the study were twofold: first, whether experienced GPs would be more resistant to patient demands than the trainees, and second, to investigate whether medical doctors would take the virtual situation seriously. Results Eight out of the 9 trainees prescribed the antibiotics, whereas 7 out of the 12 GPs did so. On the basis of a Bayesian analysis, these results yield reasonable statistical evidence in favor of the notion that experienced GPs are more likely to withstand the pressure to prescribe antibiotics than trainee doctors, thus answering our first question positively. As for the second question, a post experience questionnaire assessing the participants’ level of presence (together with participants’ feedback and body language) suggested that overall participants did tend towards the illusion of being in the consultation room depicted in the virtual reality and that the virtual consultation taking place was really happening."

Dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism leads to pathological consequences such as sphingolipidoses and insulin resistance. Ceramides in mammals vary greatly in their acyl-chain composition: six different ceramide synthase isozymes (CERS1–6) that exhibit distinct substrate specificity and tissue distribution account for this diversity. In the present study, we demonstrated that CERS2–6 were phosphorylated at the cytoplasmic C-terminal regions. Most of the phosphorylated residues conformed to a consensus motif for phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 (CK2), and treatment of cells with the CK2-specific inhibitor CX-4945 lowered the phosphorylation levels of CERS2, -4, -5, and -6. Phosphorylation of CERS2 was especially important for its catalytic activity, acting mainly by increasing its Vmax value. Phosphorylation modestly increased the catalytic activities of CERS4 and -5 and mildly increased those of CERS3 and -6. Dephosphorylation of endogenous ceramide synthases in the mouse brain led to severely reduced activity toward the Cers2 substrates C22:0/C24:0-CoAs and modestly reduced activity toward the Cers5/6 substrate C16:0-CoA.

https://openalex.org/W2274658171,"Fifth-generation cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline, are promising drugs for treatment of bacterial infections from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These antibiotics are able to bind native PBP2a, the penicillin-binding protein encoded by the mecA resistance determinant that mediates broad class resistance to nearly all other beta-lactam antibiotics, at clinically achievable concentrations. Mechanisms of resistance to ceftaroline based on mecA mutations have been previously described. Here we compare the genomes of 11 total parent-daughter strains of Staphylococcus aureus for which specific selection by serial passaging with ceftaroline or ceftobiprole was used to identify novel non-mecA mechanisms of resistance. All 5 ceftaroline-resistant strains, derived from 5 different parental strains, contained mutations directly upstream of the pbp4 gene (coding for the PBP4 protein), including four with the same thymidine insertion located 377 nucleotides upstream of the promoter site. In 4 of 5 independent ceftaroline-driven selections, we also isolated mutations to the same residue (Asn138) in PBP4. In addition, mutations in additional candidate genes such as ClpX endopeptidase, PP2C protein phosphatase and transcription terminator Rho, previously undescribed in the context of resistance to ceftaroline or ceftobiprole, were detected in multiple selections. These genomic findings suggest that non-mecA mechanisms, while yet to be encountered in the clinical setting, may also be important in mediating resistance to 5th-generation cephalosporins."

It is a glutamate analogue that can be used to measure xC- transporter activity. This study was performed to assess the feasibility of 18F-FSPG for imaging orthotopic brain tumors in small animals and the translation of this approach in human subjects with intracranial malignancies.For the small animal study, GS9L glioblastoma cells were implanted into brains of Fischer rats and studied with 18F-FSPG, the 18F-labeled glucose derivative 18F-FDG and with the 18F-labeled amino acid derivative 18F-FET. For the human study, five subjects with either primary or metastatic brain cancer were recruited (mean age 50.4 years). After injection of 300 MBq of 18F-FSPG, 3 whole-body PET/Computed Tomography (CT) scans were obtained and safety parameters were measured. The three subjects with brain metastases also had an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. Quantitative and qualitative comparison of the scans was performed to assess kinetics, biodistribution, and relative efficacy of the tracers.In the small animals, the orthotopic brain tumors were visualized well with 18F-FSPG. The high tumor uptake of 18F-FSPG in the GS9L model and the absence of background signal led to good tumor visualization with high contrast (tumor/brain ratio: 32.7). 18F-FDG and 18F-FET showed T/B ratios of 1.7 and 2.8, respectively. In the human pilot study, 18F-FSPG was well tolerated and there was similar distribution in all patients. All malignant lesions were positive with 18F-FSPG except for one low-grade primary brain tumor. In the 18F-FSPG-PET-positive tumors a similar T/B ratio was observed as in the animal model.18F-FSPG is a novel PET radiopharmaceutical that demonstrates good uptake in both small animal and human studies of intracranial malignancies. Future studies on larger numbers of subjects and a wider array of brain tumors are planned.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01186601."
https://openalex.org/W2282831896,"Spatially continuous predictions of seabed hardness are important baseline environmental information for sustainable management of Australia’s marine jurisdiction. Seabed hardness is often inferred from multibeam backscatter data with unknown accuracy and can be inferred from underwater video footage at limited locations. In this study, we classified the seabed into four classes based on two new seabed hardness classification schemes (i.e., hard90 and hard70). We developed optimal predictive models to predict seabed hardness using random forest (RF) based on the point data of hardness classes and spatially continuous multibeam data. Five feature selection (FS) methods that are variable importance (VI), averaged variable importance (AVI), knowledge informed AVI (KIAVI), Boruta and regularized RF (RRF) were tested based on predictive accuracy. Effects of highly correlated, important and unimportant predictors on the accuracy of RF predictive models were examined. Finally, spatial predictions generated using the most accurate models were visually examined and analysed. This study confirmed that: 1) hard90 and hard70 are effective seabed hardness classification schemes; 2) seabed hardness of four classes can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy; 3) the typical approach used to pre-select predictive variables by excluding highly correlated variables needs to be re-examined; 4) the identification of the important and unimportant predictors provides useful guidelines for further improving predictive models; 5) FS methods select the most accurate predictive model(s) instead of the most parsimonious ones, and AVI and Boruta are recommended for future studies; and 6) RF is an effective modelling method with high predictive accuracy for multi-level categorical data and can be applied to ‘small p and large n’ problems in environmental sciences. Additionally, automated computational programs for AVI need to be developed to increase its computational efficiency and caution should be taken when applying filter FS methods in selecting predictive models."
https://openalex.org/W2275563796,"There are unprecedented epidemics of obesity, such as type II diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) in developed countries. A concerning percentage of American children are being affected by obesity and NAFLD. Studies have suggested that the maternal environment in utero might play a role in the development of these diseases later in life. In this study, we documented that inhibiting SIRT1 signaling in human fetal hepatocytes rapidly led to an increase in intracellular glucose and lipids levels. More importantly, both de novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis related genes were upregulated upon SIRT1 inhibition. The AKT/FOXO1 pathway, a major negative regulator of gluconeogenesis, was decreased in the human fetal hepatocytes inhibited for SIRT1, consistent with the higher level of gluconeogenesis. These results indicate that SIRT1 is an important regulator of lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms within human fetal hepatocytes, acting as an adaptive transcriptional response to environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W2276838566,"The Hippo signaling pathway controls organ size by orchestrating cell proliferation and apoptosis. When the Hippo pathway was inactivated, the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie translocates into the nucleus and forms a complex with transcription factor Scalloped to promote the expression of Hippo pathway target genes. Therefore, the nuclear translocation of Yorkie is a critical step in Hippo signaling. Here, we provide evidence that the N-terminal 1-55 amino acids of Yorkie, especially Arg-15, were essential for its nuclear localization. By mass spectrometry and biochemical analyses, we found that Importin α1 can directly interact with the Yorkie N terminus and drive Yorkie into the nucleus. Further experiments show that the upstream component Hippo can inhibit Importin α1-mediated Yorkie nuclear import. Taken together, we identified a potential nuclear localization signal at the N-terminal end of Yorkie as well as a critical role for Importin α1 in Yorkie nuclear import."

We hypothesized that online body core temperature recording and selective interventions help to standardize peri-interventional temperature control and the reliability of outcomes in experimental renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). We recorded core temperature in up to seven mice in parallel using a Thermes USB recorder and ret-3-iso rectal probes with three different protocols. Setup A: Heating pad during ischemia time; Setup B: Heating pad from incision to wound closure; Setup C: A ventilated heating chamber before surgery and during ischemia time with surgeries performed on a heating pad. Temperature profile recording displayed significant declines upon installing anesthesia. The profile of the baseline experimental setup A revealed that <1% of the temperature readings were within the target range of 36.5 to 38.5°C. Setup B and C increased the target range readings to 34.6 ± 28.0% and 99.3 ± 1.5%, respectively. Setup C significantly increased S3 tubular necrosis, neutrophil influx, and mRNA expression of kidney injury markers. In addition, using setup C different ischemia times generated a linear correlation with acute tubular necrosis parameters at a low variability, which further correlated with the degree of kidney atrophy 5 weeks after surgery. Changing temperature control setup A to C was equivalent to 10 minutes more ischemia time. We conclude that body temperature drops quickly in mice upon initiating anesthesia. Immediate heat supply, e.g. in a ventilated heating chamber, and online core temperature monitoring can help to standardize and optimize experimental outcomes."

The aim of this study was to analyze the cytotoxicity of Cu-NPs on primary hepatocytes of E.coioides compared with copper sulphate (CuSO4). Cultured cells were exposed to 0 or 2.4 mg Cu L-1 as CuSO4or Cu-NPs for 24-h. Results showed either form of Cu caused a dramatic loss in cell viability, more so in the CuSO4 than Cu-NPs treatment. Compared to control, either CuSO4 or Cu-NPs significantly increased reactive oxygen species(ROS) and malondialdehyde(MDA) concentration in hepatocytes by overwhelming total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity, catalase(CAT) activity and glutathione(GSH) concentration. In addition, the antioxidative-related genes [SOD (Cu/Zn), SOD (Mn), CAT, GPx4] were also down-regulated. The apoptosis and necrosis percentage was significantly higher after the CuSO4 or Cu-NPs treatment than the control. The apoptosis was induced by the increased cytochrome c concentration in the cytosol and elevated caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities. Additionally, the apoptosis-related genes (p53, p38β and TNF-α) and protein (p53 protein) were up-regulated after the CuSO4 or Cu-NPs treatment, with CuSO4 exposure having a greater effect than Cu-NPs. In conclusion, Cu-NPs had similar types of toxic effects as CuSO4 on primary hepatocytes of E.coioides, but toxicity of CuSO4 was more severe than that of Cu-NPs."

Although periostin is expressed in inflamed colonic mucosa, its role in the regulation of intestinal inflammation remains unclear. We investigated the role of periostin in intestinal inflammation using Postn-deficient (Postn-/-) mice. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were transfected by Postn small interfering RNAs. Periostin expression was determined in colon tissue samples from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or rectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, induced severe colitis in wild-type mice, but not in Postn-/- mice. Administration of recombinant periostin induced colitis in Postn-/- mice. The periostin neutralizing-antibody ameliorated the severity of colitis in DSS-treated wild-type mice. Silencing of Postn inhibited inteleukin (IL)-8 mRNA expression and NF-κB DNA-binding activity in IECs. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α upregulated mRNA expression of Postn in IECs, and recombinant periostin strongly enhanced IL-8 expression in combination with TNF-α, which was suppressed by an antibody against integrin αv (CD51). Periostin and CD51 were expressed at significantly higher levels in UC patients than in controls.

https://openalex.org/W2287525364,"Background Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is not new to the world. However, the West African EVD epidemic which started in 2014 evolved into the largest, most severe and most complex outbreak in the history of the disease. The three most-affected countries faced enormous challenges in stopping the transmission and providing care for all patients. Although Ghana had not recorded any confirmed Ebola case, social factors have been reported to hinder efforts to control the outbreak in the three most affected countries. This qualitative study was designed to explore community knowledge and attitudes about Ebola and its transmission. Methods This study was carried out in five of the ten regions in Ghana. Twenty-five focus group discussions (N = 235) and 40 in-depth interviews were conducted across the five regions with community members, stakeholders and opinion leaders. The interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. Framework analysis was adopted in the analysis of the data using Nvivo 10. Results The results showed a high level of awareness and knowledge about Ebola. The study further showed that knowledge on how to identify suspected cases of Ebola was also high among respondents. However, there was a firm belief that Ebola was a spiritual condition and could also be transmitted through air, mosquito bites and houseflies. These misconceptions resulted in perceptions of stigma and discrimination towards people who may get Ebola or work with Ebola patients. Conclusion We conclude that although knowledge and awareness about Ebola is high among Ghanaians who participated in the study, there are still misconceptions about the disease. The study recommends that health education on Ebola disease should move beyond creating awareness to targeting the identified misconceptions to improve future containment efforts."

As such, it also constitutes the main methodological approach for biomarker validation and further qualification. For the latter, specific assay performance requirements have to be met, as described in respective guidelines of regulatory agencies. Even though many clinical ELISA assays in serum are regularly used, ELISA clinical applications in urine are significantly less. The scope of our study was to evaluate ELISA assay analytical performance in urine for a series of potential biomarkers for bladder cancer, as a first step towards their large scale clinical validation. Seven biomarkers (Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, Survivin, Slit homolog 2 protein, NRC-Interacting Factor 1, Histone 2B, Proteinase-3 and Profilin-1) previously described in the literature as having differential expression in bladder cancer were included in the study. A total of 11 commercially available ELISA tests for these markers were tested by standard curve analysis, assay reproducibility, linearity and spiking experiments. The results show disappointing performance with coefficients of variation>20% for the vast majority of the tests performed. Only 3 assays (for Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, Survivin and Slit homolog 2 protein) passed the accuracy thresholds and were found suitable for further application in marker quantification. These results collectively reflect the difficulties in developing urine-based ELISA assays of sufficient analytical performance for clinical application, presumably attributed to the urine matrix itself and/or presence of markers in various isoforms."

https://openalex.org/W2286317920,"The evolution of drug resistant parasitic sea lice is of major concern to the salmon farming industry worldwide and challenges sustainable growth of this enterprise. To assess current status and development of L. salmonis sensitivity towards different pesticides used for parasite control in Norwegian salmon farming, a national surveillance programme was implemented in 2013. The programme aims to summarize data on the use of different pesticides applied to control L. salmonis and to test L. salmonis sensitivity to different pesticides in farms along the Norwegian coast. Here we analyse two years of test-data from biological assays designed to detect sensitivity-levels towards the pesticides azamethiphos and deltamethrin, both among the most common pesticides used in bath-treatments of farmed salmon in Norway in later years. The focus of the analysis is on how different variables predict the binomial outcome of the bioassay tests, being whether L. salmonis are immobilized/die or survive pesticide exposure. We found that local kernel densities of bath treatments, along with a spatial geographic index of test-farm locations, were significant predictors of the binomial outcome of the tests. Furthermore, the probability of L. salmonis being immobilized/dead after test-exposure was reduced by odds-ratios of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.42-0.86) for 2014 compared to 2013 and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.36-0.42) for low concentration compared to high concentration exposure. There were also significant but more marginal effects of parasite gender and developmental stage, and a relatively large random effect of test-farm. We conclude that the present data support an association between local intensities of bath treatments along the coast and the outcome of bioassay tests where salmon lice are exposed to azamethiphos or deltamethrin. Furthermore, there is a predictable structure of L. salmonis phenotypes along the coast in the data, characterized by high susceptibility to pesticides in the far north and far south, but low susceptibility in mid Norway. The study emphasizes the need to address local susceptibility to pesticides and the need for restrictive use of pesticides to preserve treatment efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2277305587,"Saliency detection attracted attention of many researchers and had become a very active area of research. Recently, many saliency detection models have been proposed and achieved excellent performance in various fields. However, most of these models only consider low-level features. This paper proposes a novel saliency detection model using both color and texture features and incorporating higher-level priors. The SLIC superpixel algorithm is applied to form an over-segmentation of the image. Color saliency map and texture saliency map are calculated based on the region contrast method and adaptive weight. Higher-level priors including location prior and color prior are incorporated into the model to achieve a better performance and full resolution saliency map is obtained by using the up-sampling method. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed saliency detection model outperforms the state-of-the-art models."
https://openalex.org/W2277118668,"Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer is a highly valued medicinal plant. Cylindrocarpon destructans is a destructive pathogen that causes root rot and significantly reduces the quality and yield of P. ginseng. However, an efficient method to control root rot remains unavailable because of insufficient understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying C. destructans-P. ginseng interaction. In this study, C. destructans-induced transcriptomes at different time points were investigated using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). De novo assembly produced 73,335 unigenes for the P. ginseng transcriptome after C. destructans infection, in which 3,839 unigenes were up-regulated. Notably, the abundance of the up-regulated unigenes sharply increased at 0.5 d postinoculation to provide effector-triggered immunity. In total, 24 of 26 randomly selected unigenes can be validated using quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these unigenes showed that “defense response to fungus”, “defense response” and “response to stress” were enriched. In addition, differentially expressed transcription factors involved in the hormone signaling pathways after C. destructans infection were identified. Finally, differentially expressed unigenes involved in reactive oxygen species and ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway during C. destructans infection were indentified. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report on the dynamic transcriptome triggered by C. destructans. These results improve our understanding of disease resistance in P. ginseng and provide a useful resource for quick detection of induced markers in P. ginseng before the comprehensive outbreak of this disease caused by C. destructans."
https://openalex.org/W2279317549,"Ivabradine not only reduces heart rate but has other cardiac and vascular protective effects including anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. Since endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a crucial enzyme in maintaining endothelial activity, we aimed to investigate the impact of ivabradine in low shear stress (LSS) induced inflammation and endothelial injury and the role of eNOS played in it. Endothelial cells (ECs) were subjected to LSS at 2dyne/cm2, with 1 hour of ivabradine (0.04μM) or LY294002 (10μM) pre-treatment. The mRNA expression of IL-6, VCAM-1 along with eNOS were measured by QPCR. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by dihydroethidium (DHE) and DCF, and protein phosphorylation was detected by western blot. It demonstrated that ivabradine decreased LSS induced inflammation and oxidative stress in endothelial cells. Western blot showed reduced rictor and Akt-Ser473 as well as increased eNOS-Thr495 phosphorylation. However, mTORC1 pathway was only increased when LSS applied within 30 minutes. These effects were reversed by ivabradine. It would appear that ivabradine diminish ROS generation by provoking mTORC2/Akt phosphorylation and repressing mTORC1 induced eNOS-Thr495 activation. These results together suggest that LSS induced endothelial inflammation and oxidative stress are suppressed by ivabradine via mTORC2/Akt activation and mTORC1/eNOS reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2284120807,"In restricted areas of the adult brain, like the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG), there is continuous production of new neurons. This process, named adult neurogenesis, is involved in important cognitive functions such as memory and learning. It requires the presence of newborn neurons that arise from neuronal stem cells, which divide and differentiate through successive stages in adulthood. In this work, we demonstrate that overexpression of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β in neural precursor cells (NPCs) using the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter during DG development produces an increase in the neurogenic process, increasing NPCs numbers. Moreover, the transgenic mice show higher DG volume and increased number of mature granule neurons. In an attempt to compensate for these alterations, glial fibrillary acidic protein/GSK3β-overexpressing mice show increased levels of Dkk1 and sFRP3, two inhibitors of the Wnt-frizzled complex. We have also found behavioral differences between wild type and transgenic mice, indicating a higher rating in memory tasks for GSK3β-overexpressing mice compared with wild type mice. These data indicate that GSK3β is a crucial kinase in NPC physiology and suggest that this molecule plays a key role in the correct development of DG and adult neurogenesis in this region.

The association between digit sucking, dental caries and oral health has been studied with inconclusive results. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of, and the association between digit sucking, caries and oral hygiene status of children age six months to 12 years, resident in Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ife Central Local Government Area of Osun State. Data were collected through a household survey using a multi-stage sampling procedure from children between six months and 12 years. Details of each child's socio-demographic characteristics, digit sucking habits, caries status and oral health status were collected. The association between digit sucking, caries status and oral hygiene status was determined using Chi square and Logistic regression.The mean age of the 992 study participants was 5.8 ± (3.2) years. The prevalence of digit sucking, caries and poor oral hygiene were 7.2%, 10.5% and 2.4% respectively. The mean dmft score was 0.22 ± (0.80), mean DMFT score was 0.04 ± (0.30) while mean Oral Hygiene Index score was 1.27 ± (0.73). Digit sucking increased the odds of having caries (OR: 1.28; CI: 0.58-2.81) but decreased the odds of having poor oral hygiene (OR: 0.58; CI: 0.34-1.01) insignificantly.Digit sucking was not a significant predictor of caries and oral hygiene status, although the odds of having caries increased while the odds of having poor oral hygiene decreased with digit sucking."

The maximum and average pixel intensity values along an elliptical mask within the lens nucleus were taken to analyse nuclear cataracts. A new metric based on the percentage of opaque pixels within a region of interest was used to analyse cortical cataracts. The percentage of opaque pixels was also calculated for half, third and quarter areas from the region of interest's periphery.The maximum and average intensity values along the nucleus were directly proportional to the LOCS III grade: The larger the LOCS III value, the larger maximum and average intensity ones. These metrics showed a positive and significant correlation with the LOCS grade: The larger the LOCS grade, the higher was percentage of opaque pixels along the cortex within the same mask's size. This metric showed a significant correlation to the LOCS grade.The metrics used to assess nuclear opacities showed good correlation with the LOCS III. The percentage of opaque pixels showed to be a useful metric to measure objectively the severity of the cortical opacity. These metrics could be implemented in an algorithm to detect and grade lens opacities automatically and objectively."
https://openalex.org/W2281185882,The successful use of specialized cells in regenerative medicine requires an optimization in the differentiation protocols that are currently used. Understanding the molecular events that take place during the differentiation of human pluripotent cells is essential for the improvement of these protocols and the generation of high quality differentiated cells. In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern differentiation we identify the methyltransferase SETD7 as highly induced during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells and differentially expressed between induced pluripotent cells and somatic cells. Knock-down of SETD7 causes differentiation defects in human embryonic stem cell including delay in both the silencing of pluripotency-related genes and the induction of differentiation genes. We show that SETD7 methylates linker histone H1 in vitro causing conformational changes in H1. These effects correlate with a decrease in the recruitment of H1 to the pluripotency genes OCT4 and NANOG during differentiation in the SETD7 knock down that might affect the proper silencing of these genes during differentiation.
https://openalex.org/W2275956353,"Bone continuously undergoes remodeling by a tightly regulated process that involves osteoblast differentiation from Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC). However, commitment of MSC to osteoblastic lineage is a poorly understood process. Chromatin organization functions as a molecular gatekeeper of DNA functions. Detection of sites that are hypersensitive to Dnase I has been used for detailed examination of changes in response to hormones and differentiation cues. To investigate the early steps in commitment of MSC to osteoblasts, we used a model human temperature-sensitive cell line, hFOB. When shifted to non-permissive temperature, these cells undergo ""spontaneous"" differentiation that takes several weeks, a process that is greatly accelerated by osteogenic induction media. We performed Dnase I hypersensitivity assays combined with deep sequencing to identify genome-wide potential regulatory events in cells undergoing early steps of commitment to osteoblasts. Massive reorganization of chromatin occurred within hours of differentiation. Whereas ~30% of unique DHS sites were located in the promoters, the majority was outside of the promoters, designated as enhancers. Many of them were at novel genomic sites and need to be confirmed experimentally. We developed a novel method for identification of cellular networks based solely on DHS enhancers signature correlated to gene expression. The analysis of enhancers that were unique to differentiating cells led to identification of bone developmental program encompassing 147 genes that directly or indirectly participate in osteogenesis. Identification of these pathways provided an unprecedented view of genomic regulation during early steps of differentiation and changes related to WNT, AP-1 and other pathways may have therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2279156822,"Type II diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) isozymes (δ, η, and κ) have a pleckstrin homology domain (PH) at their N termini. Here, we investigated the lipid binding properties of the PHs of type II DGK isozymes using protein-lipid overlay and liposome binding assays. The PH of DGKη showed the most pronounced binding activity to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) among the various glycero- and sphingolipids including PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate, PI 3,4-bisphosphate, PI 3-phosphate, PI 4-phosphate, and PI 5-phosphate. Moreover, the PI(4,5)P2 binding activity of the DGKη-PH was significantly stronger than that of other type II DGK isozymes. Notably, compared with the PH of phospholipase C (PLC) δ1, which is generally utilized as a cellular PI(4,5)P2- probe, the DGKη-PH is equal to or superior than the PLCδ1-PH in terms of affinity and selectivity for PI(4,5)P2. Furthermore, in COS-7 cells, GFP-fused wild-type DGKη1 and its PH partly translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where the PLCδ1-PH was co-localized in response to hyperosmotic stress in an inositol 5-phosphatase-sensitive manner, whereas a PH deletion mutant did not. Moreover, K74A and R85A mutants of DGKη-PH, which lack the conserved basic amino acids thought to ligate PI(4,5)P2, were indeed unable to bind to PI(4,5)P2 and co-localize with the PLCδ1-PH even in osmotically shocked cells. Overexpression of wild-type DGKη1 enhanced EGF-dependent phosphorylation of ERK, whereas either K74A or R85A mutant did not. Taken together, these results indicate that the DGKη-PH preferentially interacts with PI(4,5)P2 and has crucial roles in regulating the subcellular localization and physiological function of DGKη. Moreover, the DGKη-PH could serve as an excellent cellular sensor for PI(4,5)P2."
https://openalex.org/W2286936909,"Conidiophore development of fungi belonging to the genus Aspergillus involves dynamic changes in cellular polarity and morphogenesis. Synchronized differentiation of phialides from the subtending conidiophore vesicle is a good example of the transition from isotropic to multi-directional polarized growth. Here we report a small GTPase, RacA, which is essential for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the vesicle as well as differentiation of phialides in Aspergillus fumigatus. We found that wild type A. fumigatus accumulates ROS in these conidiophore vesicles and that null mutants of racA did not, resulting in the termination of conidiophore development in this early vesicle stage. Further, we found that stress conditions resulting in atypical ROS accumulation coincide with partial recovery of phialide emergence but not subsequent apical dominance of the phialides in the racA null mutant, suggesting alternative means of ROS generation for the former process that are lacking in the latter. Elongation of phialides was also suppressed by inhibition of NADPH-oxidase activity. Our findings provide not only insights into role of ROS in fungal cell polarity and morphogenesis but also an improved model for the developmental regulatory pathway of conidiogenesis in A. fumigatus."

Different amounts of recombinant His-tagged Y14 or 2 μg (∼100 pmol) of His-Y14 (wild-type or W73V mutant) was incubated with 5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and 50 ng of in vitro transcribed Renilla luciferase reporter mRNA in a 10-μl mixture at 30 °C for 3 h. Renilla luciferase activity was measured as described above. The Renilla luciferase transcripts were examined by RT-qPCR using primers as described above. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the empty or FLAG-Y14 (wild-type or W73V) vector. After transfection for 48 h, cells were cultured in methionine-free medium for 30 min to deplete endogenous methionine, followed by incubation with 50 μm l-azidohomoalanine (Invitrogen) for 4 h. Cells were collected, suspended in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), sonicated for two cycles of 30 s each and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C to pellet cellular debris. Cell lysates were subjected to Click reactions overnight at 4 °C with 40 μm biotin (Invitrogen) using the Click-iT® Protein Reaction Buffer kit (Invitrogen) according to the instructions. Biotin-tagged proteins were then incubated with 20 μl of Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C followed by washing five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% SDS. Purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and immunoblotting. Cytoplasmic extracts of HeLa cells were fractionated on linear 15–40% sucrose gradients as described (25.Lai M.C.

PYM was in vitro translated and 35S-labeled using the TNT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and was incubated with 2 μg of individual GST-fusion proteins (∼40 pmol) in a 50-μl mixture for 30 min at 30 °C followed by affinity selection with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 5 × 104 cpm (∼75 fmol) of in vitro-transcribed 32P-labeled PIP85aΔi RNA was incubated with 1 μg of one of the GST-Y14 fusions (∼20 pmol) in a 25-μl mixture for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 64.6 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). To identify residues required for cap-binding of Y14, we first compared Y14 with that of two other cap-binding proteins, namely eIF4E and CBP20. Basic local alignment search revealed that Y14 has 25.3% and 27.5% overall amino acid sequence similarity with eIF4E and CBP20, respectively (Fig. 1A). The similarity between Y14 and CBP20 is essentially confined to the RNA recognition motif. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis have revealed that four residues (Tyr-20, Tyr-43, Phe-83, and Phe-85) in the RNA recognition motif of CBP20 are critical for cap binding (29.Mazza C. Segref A. Mattaj I.W. Cusack S.

Segref A. Mattaj I.W. Cusack S. Crystal structure of the human nuclear cap binding complex.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 383-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); among those, Tyr-43 and Phe-83 may correspond to Phe-76 and Tyr-116, respectively, of Y14. In eIF4E, the cap-binding residues comprise Trp-56 and Trp-102 that form base sandwich-stacking with the m7G moiety as well as several charged residues including Glu-103 (31.Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cocrystal structure of the messenger RNA 5′ cap-binding protein (eIF4E) bound to 7-methyl-GDP.Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Our primary sequence alignment between Y14 and eIF4E suggested that Trp-56 and Tyr-76 of eIF4E may be equivalent to Trp-73 and Phe-93 of Y14 (Fig. 1A). Additionally, structural modeling suggested that Trp-73, Phe-76, Tyr-116, and Phe-150 of Y14 are located at the surface and may contribute to cap binding (Fig. 1B). According to this result, we then generated a series of valine-substituted point mutants in Y14 (including the above conserved residues) and evaluated their cap-binding capacity. Cross-linking with UV was performed using purified recombinant GST-fused wild-type or mutant Y14 proteins and an RNA fragment containing a 32P-labeled m7G*pppG (the asterisk denotes the 32P label) (22.Chuang T.W. Chang W.L. Lee K.M. Tarn W.Y. The RNA-binding protein Y14 inhibits mRNA decapping and modulates processing body formation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The result showed that mutations at Trp-73 and Phe-150, but not any other examined residues, significantly disrupted the cap-binding capacity of Y14 (Fig. 1C). We then evaluated the cap-binding capacity of the W73V mutant using m7GTP affinity chromatography. As compared with the wild-type and the Magoh-interacting defective mutant L118R, W73V bound inefficiently to the m7GTP resin (Fig. 1D). This result in part supports the predicted model that residues Trp-73 and Phe-150 are involved in cap binding, perhaps by forming sandwich-like stacking with the methylguanine moiety of the cap. We previously showed that Y14 protects reporter RNAs from degradation by inhibiting the decapping activity of Dcp2 (22.Chuang T.W. Chang W.L. Lee K.M. Tarn W.Y. The RNA-binding protein Y14 inhibits mRNA decapping and modulates processing body formation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it remains unclear whether the cap binding of Y14 is essential for mRNA protection. We first evaluated whether the W73V mutation hampers the interaction between Y14 and the decapping complex. Immunoprecipitation of overexpressed FLAG-tagged Y14 showed that the W73V mutant had equivalent capacity"
https://openalex.org/W2279756269,"Behçet’s disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing, multisystemic inflammatory disorder with unanswered questions regarding its etiology/pathogenesis and classification. Distinct manifestation based subsets, pronounced geographical variations in expression, and discrepant immunological abnormalities raised the question whether Behçet’s is “a disease or a syndrome”. To answer the preceding question we aimed to display and compare the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct subsets of BD. For this purpose, the expression data of the gene expression profiling and association study on BD by Xavier et al (2013) was retrieved from GEO database and reanalysed by gene expression data analysis/visualization and bioinformatics enrichment tools. There were 15 BD patients (B) and 14 controls (C). Three subsets of BD patients were generated: MB (isolated mucocutaneous manifestations, n = 7), OB (ocular involvement, n = 4), and VB (large vein thrombosis, n = 4). Class comparison analyses yielded the following numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs); B vs C: 4, MB vs C: 5, OB vs C: 151, VB vs C: 274, MB vs OB: 215, MB vs VB: 760, OB vs VB: 984. Venn diagram analysis showed that there were no common DEGs in the intersection “MB vs C” ∩ “OB vs C” ∩ “VB vs C”. Cluster analyses successfully clustered distinct expressions of BD. During gene ontology term enrichment analyses, categories with relevance to IL-8 production (MB vs C) and immune response to microorganisms (OB vs C) were differentially enriched. Distinct subsets of BD display distinct expression profiles and different disease associated pathways. Based on these clear discrepancies, the designation as “Behçet’s syndrome” (BS) should be encouraged and future research should take into consideration the immunogenetic heterogeneity of BS subsets. Four gene groups, namely, negative regulators of inflammation (CD69, CLEC12A, CLEC12B, TNFAIP3), neutrophil granule proteins (LTF, OLFM4, AZU1, MMP8, DEFA4, CAMP), antigen processing and presentation proteins (CTSS, ERAP1), and regulators of immune response (LGALS2, BCL10, ITCH, CEACAM8, CD36, IL8, CCL4, EREG, NFKBIZ, CCR2, CD180, KLRC4, NFAT5) appear to be instrumental in BS immunopathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2281251635,"In this study we sought to explore how experience with specific mental and somatic practices is associated with wisdom, using self-report measures of experience and wisdom. We administered standard surveys to measure wisdom and experience among four groups of practitioners of mental and somatic practices, namely, meditators, practitioners of the Alexander Technique, practitioners of the Feldenkrais Method, and classical ballet dancers. We additionally administered surveys of trait anxiety and empathy to all participants to explore possible mediating relationships of experience and wisdom by characteristics thought to be components of wisdom. Wisdom was higher on average among meditation practitioners, and lowest among ballet dancers, and this difference held when controlling for differences in age between practices, supporting the view that meditation is linked to wisdom and that ballet is not. However, we found that increased experience with meditation and ballet were both positively associated with wisdom, and that lowered trait anxiety mediated this positive association among meditation practitioners, and, non-significantly, among ballet dancers. These results suggest that not all practices that are purported to affect mental processing are related to wisdom to the same degree and different kinds of experience appear to relate to wisdom in different ways, suggesting different mechanisms that might underlie the development of wisdom with experience."
https://openalex.org/W2284937257,"Hyperuricemia (HU) often progresses to combine with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the clinical scenario, which further exacerbates metabolic disorders; early detection of biomarkers, if obtained during the HU progression, may be beneficial for preventing its combination with NAFLD. This study aimed to decipher the biomarkers and mechanisms of the development of steatosis in HU. Four groups of subjects undergoing health screening, including healthy subjects, subjects with HU, subjects with HU combined with NAFLD (HU+NAFLD) and subjects with HU initially and then with HU+NAFLD one year later (HU→HU+NAFLD), were recruited in this study. The metabolic profiles of all subjects' serum were analyzed by liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The metabolomic data from subjects with HU and HU+NAFLD were compared, and the biomarkers for the progression from HU to HU+NAFLD were predicted. The metabolomic data from HU→HU+NAFLD subjects were collected for further verification. The results showed that the progression was associated with disturbances of phospholipase metabolism, purine nucleotide degradation and Liver X receptor/retinoic X receptor activation as characterized by up-regulated phosphatidic acid, cholesterol ester (18:0) and down-regulated inosine. These metabolic alterations may be at least partially responsible for the development of steatosis in HU. This study provides a new paradigm for better understanding and further prevention of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2283526102,"Background The growing burden of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been a great challenge to the health care system of China. However, the exact epidemiological data for ESRD in China remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology of ESRD treated by renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Nanjing based on analysing ten-year data of Nanjing three million insurance covered population. Methods Using the electronic registry system of Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), we included all subjects insured by UEBMI in Nanjing from 2005 to 2014 and identified subjects who developed ESRD and started RRT in this cohort. Results The UEBMI population in Nanjing increased from 1,301,882 in 2005 to 2,921,065 in 2014, among which a total of 5,840 subjects developed ESRD and received RRT. Over the 10-year period, the adjusted incidence rates of RRT in the UEBMI cohort gradually decreased from 289.3pmp in 2005 to 218.8pmp in 2014. However, the adjusted prevalence rate increased steadily from 891.7pmp in 2005 to 1,228.6pmp in 2014. The adjusted annual mortality rate decreased from 138.4 per 1000 patient-years in 2005 to 97.8 per 1000 patient-years in 2014. The long-term survival rate fluctuated over the past decade, with the 1-year survival rate ranging from 85.1% to 91.7%, the 3-year survival rate from 69.9% to 78.3% and the 5-year survival rate from 58% to 65.4%. Conclusion Nanjing is facing an increasing burden of ESRD with its improvement of medical reform. The ten-year complete registry data on RRT in urban employees in Nanjing provided a unique opportunity to understand the real threat of ESRD confronting China during its process of health care transition."
https://openalex.org/W2285932413,"This article explores possible mechanisms governing extracellular matrix deposition in engineered cartilaginous cell pellets. A theoretical investigation is carried out alongside an experimental study measuring proteoglycan and collagen volume fractions within murine chondrogenic (ATDC-5) cell pellets. The simple mathematical model, which adopts a nutrient-dependent proteoglycan production rate, successfully reproduces the periphery-dominated proteoglycan deposition, characteristic of the growth pattern observed experimentally within pellets after 21 days of culture. The results suggest that this inhomogeneous proteoglycan production is due to nutrient deficiencies at the pellet centre. Our model analysis further indicates that a spatially uniform distribution of proteoglycan matrix could be maintained by initiating the culture process with a smaller-sized pellet. Finally, possible extensions are put forward with an aim to improve the model predictions for the early behaviour, where different mechanisms appear to dominate the matrix production within the pellets."
https://openalex.org/W2287069442,"The present study was performed to assess the quality of Potentilla fruticosa L. sampled from distinct regions of China using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting coupled with a suite of chemometric methods. For this quantitative analysis, the main active phytochemical compositions and the antioxidant activity in P. fruticosa were also investigated. Considering the high percentages and antioxidant activities of phytochemicals, P. fruticosa samples from Kangding, Sichuan were selected as the most valuable raw materials. Similarity analysis (SA) of HPLC fingerprints, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principle component analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA) were further employed to provide accurate classification and quality estimates of P. fruticosa. Two principal components (PCs) were collected by PCA. PC1 separated samples from Kangding, Sichuan, capturing 57.64% of the variance, whereas PC2 contributed to further separation, capturing 18.97% of the variance. Two kinds of discriminant functions with a 100% discrimination ratio were constructed. The results strongly supported the conclusion that the eight samples from different regions were clustered into three major groups, corresponding with their morphological classification, for which HPLC analysis confirmed the considerable variation in phytochemical compositions and that P. fruticosa samples from Kangding, Sichuan were of high quality. The results of SA, HCA, PCA, and DA were in agreement and performed well for the quality assessment of P. fruticosa. Consequently, HPLC fingerprinting coupled with chemometric techniques provides a highly flexible and reliable method for the quality evaluation of traditional Chinese medicines."
https://openalex.org/W2287069564,"Vascular calcification is an important risk factor associated with mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease. Intracellular cholesterol metabolism is involved in the process of vascular cell calcification. In this study, we investigated the role of UbiA prenyltransferase domain containing 1 (UBIAD1) in intracellular cholesterol metabolism and vascular cell calcification, and identified its subcellular location. Primary human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (HUVSMCs) were incubated with either growth medium (1.4 mmol/L Pi) or calcification medium (CM) (3.0 mmol/L Pi). Under treatment with CM, HUVSMCs were further incubated with exogenous cholesterol, or menaquinone-4, a product of UBIAD1. The plasmid and small interfering RNA were transfected in HUVSMCs to alter the expression of UBIAD1. Matrix calcium quantitation, alkaline phosphatase activity, intracellular cholesterol level and menaquinone-4 level were measured. The expression of several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were analyzed. Using an anti-UBIAD1 antibody, an endoplasmic reticulum marker and a Golgi marker, the subcellular location of UBIAD1 in HUVSMCs was analyzed. CM increased matrix calcium, alkaline phosphatase activity and intracellular cholesterol level, and reduced UBIAD1 expression and menaquinone-4 level. Addition of cholesterol contributed to increased matrix calcification and alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Elevated expression of UBIAD1 or menaquinone-4 in HUVSMCs treated with CM significantly reduced intracellular cholesterol level, matrix calcification and alkaline phosphatase activity, but increased menaquinone-4 level. Elevated expression of UBIAD1 or menaquinone-4 reduced the gene expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2, and increased gene expression of ATP binding cassette transporters A1, which are in charge of cholesterol synthesis and efflux. UBIAD1 co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum marker and the Golgi marker in HUVSMCs. In conclusion, high intracellular cholesterol content contributes to phosphate-induced vascular cell differentiation and calcification. UBIAD1 or menaquinone-4 could decrease vascular cell differentiation and calcification, probably via its potent role of inversely modulating cellular cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2283715333,"Background We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of combined single session brief behavioral intervention, either didactic or interactive (Mujer Mas Segura, MMS) to promote safer-sex and safer-injection practices among female sex workers who inject drugs (FSW-IDUs) in Tijuana (TJ) and Ciudad-Juarez (CJ) Mexico. Data for this analysis was obtained from a factorial RCT in 2008–2010 coinciding with expansion of needle exchange programs (NEP) in TJ, but not in CJ. Methods A Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained (QALY) over a lifetime time frame among a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 FSW-IDUs comparing a less intensive didactic vs. a more intensive interactive format of the MMS, separately for safer sex and safer injection combined behavioral interventions. The costs for antiretroviral therapy was not included in the model. We applied a societal perspective, a discount rate of 3% per year and currency adjusted to US$2014. A multivariate sensitivity analysis was performed. The combined and individual components of the MMS interactive behavioral intervention were compared with the didactic formats by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), defined as incremental unit of cost per additional health benefit (e.g., HIV/STI cases averted, QALYs) compared to the next least costly strategy. Following guidelines from the World Health Organization, a combined strategy was considered highly cost-effective if the incremental cost per QALY gained fell below the gross domestic product per capita (GDP) in Mexico (equivalent to US$10,300). Findings For CJ, the mixed intervention approach of interactive safer sex/didactic safer injection had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$4,360 ($310–$7,200) per QALY gained compared with a dually didactic strategy. Using the dually interactive strategy had an ICER of US$5,874 ($310–$7,200) compared with the mixed approach. For TJ, the combination of interactive safer sex/didactic safer injection had an ICER of US$5,921 ($104–$9,500) per QALY compared with dually didactic. Strategies using the interactive safe injection intervention were dominated due to lack of efficacy advantage. The multivariate sensitivity analysis showed a 95% certainty that in both CJ and TJ the ICER for the mixed approach (interactive safer sex didactic safer injection intervention) was less than the GDP per capita for Mexico. The dual interactive approach met this threshold consistently in CJ, but not in TJ. Interpretation In the absence of an expanded NEP in CJ, the combined-interactive formats of the MMS behavioral intervention is highly cost-effective. In contrast, in TJ where NEP expansion suggests that improved access to sterile syringes significantly reduced injection-related risks, the interactive safer-sex combined didactic safer-injection was highly cost-effective compared with the combined didactic versions of the safer-sex and safer-injection formats of the MMS, with no added benefit from the interactive safer-injection component."
https://openalex.org/W2285601991,"Among the human heme-peroxidase family, myeloperoxidase (MPO) has a unique disulfide-linked oligomeric structure resulting from multi-step processing of the pro-protein monomer (proMPO) after it exits the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Related family members undergo some, but not all, of the processing steps involved with formation of mature MPO. Lactoperoxidase has its pro-domain proteolytically removed and is a monomer in its mature form. Eosinophil peroxidase undergoes proteolytic removal of its pro-domain followed by proteolytic separation into heavy and light chains and is a heterodimer. However, only MPO undergoes both these proteolytic modifications and then is further oligomerized into a heterotetramer by a single inter-molecular disulfide bond. The details of how and where the post-ER processing steps of MPO occur are incompletely understood. We report here that T47D breast cancer cells stably transfected with an MPO expression plasmid are able to efficiently replicate all of the processing steps that lead to formation of the mature MPO heterotetramer. MPO also traffics to the lysosome granules of T47D cells where it accumulates, allowing in-depth immunofluorescent microscopy studies of MPO trafficking and storage for the first time. Using this novel cell model we show that formation of MPO’s single inter-molecular disulfide bond can occur normally in the absence of the proteolytic events that lead to separation of the MPO heavy and light chains. We further demonstrate that Cys319, which forms MPO’s unique inter-molecular disulfide bond, is important for events that precede this step. Mutation of this residue alters the glycosylation and catalytic activity of MPO and blocks its entry into the endocytic pathway where proteolytic processing and disulfide bonding occur. Finally, using the endocytic trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases as a guide, we investigate the role of candidate receptors in the endocytic trafficking of MPO."
https://openalex.org/W2280705831,"Fish vocalisation is often a major component of underwater soundscapes. Therefore, interpretation of these soundscapes requires an understanding of the vocalisation characteristics of common soniferous fish species. This study of captive female bluefin gurnard, Chelidonichthys kumu, aims to formally characterise their vocalisation sounds and daily pattern of sound production. Four types of sound were produced and characterised, twice as many as previously reported in this species. These sounds fit two aural categories; grunt and growl, the mean peak frequencies for which ranged between 129 to 215 Hz. This species vocalized throughout the 24 hour period at an average rate of (18.5 ± 2.0 sounds fish-1 h-1) with an increase in vocalization rate at dawn and dusk. Competitive feeding did not elevate vocalisation as has been found in other gurnard species. Bluefin gurnard are common in coastal waters of New Zealand, Australia and Japan and, given their vocalization rate, are likely to be significant contributors to ambient underwater soundscape in these areas."
https://openalex.org/W2281314981,"During the past 40 years, more than 400 Sudden Unexplained Deaths (SUDs) have occurred in Yunnan, southwestern China. Epidemiological and toxicological analyses suggested that a newly discovered mushroom called Trogia venenata was the leading culprit for SUDs. At present, relatively little is known about the genetics and natural history of this mushroom. In this study, we analyzed the sequence variation at four DNA fragments among 232 fruiting bodies of T. venenata collected from seven locations. Our ITS sequence analyses confirmed that all the isolates belonged to the same species. The widespread presence of sequence heterozygosity within many strains at each of three protein-coding genes suggested that the fruiting bodies were diploid, dikaryotic or heterokaryotic. Within individual geographic populations, we found significant deviations of genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg expectations, with the overall observed heterozygosity lower than that expected under random mating, consistent with prevalent inbreeding within local populations. The geographic populations were overall genetically differentiated. Interestingly, while a positive correlation was found between population genetic distance and geographic distance, there was little correlation between genetic distance and barium concentration difference for the geographic populations. Our results suggest frequent inbreeding, geographic structuring, and limited gene flow among geographic populations of T. venenata from southwestern China."
https://openalex.org/W2286791219,"To investigate the inhibitory effect of Hirsutella sinensis (HS) on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial cells induced by aristolochic acid (AA) and its possible mechanism.18 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and equally divided into the following 3 groups: AA group, AA+HS group and control group. Urinary protein excretion and creatinine clearance (CCr) were measured. All rats were sacrificed at the end of 12th week. The pathological examination of renal tissue was performed and the mRNA and protein expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), cytokeratin-18 and Snail in renal cortex were determined by real time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining respectively. In addition, human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells line (HKC) was divided into the following 4 groups: AA group, AA+HS group, HS control group and control group. The above mRNA and protein expression in HKC was determined by real time quantitative PCR and Western blot respectively.(1) CCr was significantly decreased, and the urinary protein excretion and relative area of renal interstitial fibrosis were significantly increased in the rats of AA and AA+HS group compared to those in control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01); all the above abnormalities significantly lightened in the rats of AA+HS group compared to those in AA group (P<0.05). (2) The mRNA and protein expression of TGF-β1, α-SMA and Snail was significantly up-regulated and the expression of cytokeratin-18 was significantly down-regulated in the rat renal cortex as well as in the cultured HKC cells in AA and AA+HS groups compared to those in control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01); all the above abnormalities significantly alleviated in AA+HS group compared to those in AA group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). (3) Knockdown endogenous Snail expression by siRNA could ameliorate AA-induced EMT of HKC cells, while overexpression of Snail by plasmid transfection diminished the antagonistic effect of HS on AA-induced EMT. These results suggest Snail might be a potential target of HS effect.HS is able to antagonize, to some extent, tubular EMT and renal interstitial fibrosis caused by AA, which might be related to its inhibitory effects on the TGF-β1 and Snail expression."
https://openalex.org/W2276710619,"Visual crowding—the inability to see an object when it is surrounded by flankers in the periphery—does not block semantic activation: unrecognizable words due to visual crowding still generated robust semantic priming in subsequent lexical decision tasks. Based on the previous finding, the current study further explored whether unrecognizable crowded words can be temporally integrated into a phrase. By showing one word at a time, we presented Chinese four-word idioms with either a congruent or incongruent ending word in order to examine whether the three preceding crowded words can be temporally integrated to form a semantic context so as to affect the processing of the ending word. Results from both behavioral (Experiment 1) and Event-Related Potential (Experiment 2 and 3) measures showed congruency effect in only the non-crowded condition, which does not support the existence of unconscious multi-word integration. Aside from four-word idioms, we also found that two-word (modifier + adjective combination) integration—the simplest kind of temporal semantic integration—did not occur in visual crowding (Experiment 4). Our findings suggest that integration of temporally separated words might require conscious awareness, at least under the timing conditions tested in the current study."
https://openalex.org/W2278380108,"Interleukin (IL)-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine mainly secreted by activated T helper 17 cells and involved in inflammatory immune responses. This study aimed to investigate the association between IL-17 variants as well as serum IL-17 levels with gout in male Chinese Han individuals. A total of 1,101 male gout patients and 1,239 ethic-matched controls were enrolled. Genetic distributions of three variants (rs2275913 in IL-17A, rs763780 in IL-17F, and rs4819554 in IL-17RA) were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction using the Taqman probe method. The plasma concentrations of IL-17A and IL-17F were measured in 228 gout patients and 198 controls that came from above samples by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. No significant differences were observed in the genetic distribution of these polymorphisms between cases and controls (rs2275913: χ2 = 0.15, p = 0.928 by genotype, χ2 = 0.14, p = 0.711 by allele; rs763780: χ2 = 2.24, p = 0.326 by genotype, χ2 = 0.26, p = 0.609 by allele; rs4819554: χ2 = 1.79, p = 0.409 by genotype, χ2 = 1.46, p = 0.227 by allele). Levels of serum IL-17A and IL-17F were significantly decreased in gout patients (both p<0.001). However, no difference was observed in acute gout patients between different genotypic carriers of rs2275913 and rs763780 regarding serum IL-17A and IL-17F levels (p>0.05). Although the genetic variants in IL-17 we studied in this research do not appear to be involved in the development of gout in male Chinese Han individuals, the IL-17 cytokine family may participate in gouty inflammation in an undefined way, which requires further validation."
https://openalex.org/W2282617632,"Peptides with cell attachment activity are beneficial component of biomaterials for tissue engineering. Conformational structure is one of the important factors for the biological activities. The EF1 peptide (DYATLQLQEGRLHFMFDLG) derived from laminin promotes cell spreading and cell attachment activity mediated by α2β1 integrin. Although the sequence of the EF2 peptide (DFATVQLRNGFPYFSYDLG) is homologous sequence to that of EF1, EF2 does not promote cell attachment activity. To determine whether there are structural differences between EF1 and EF2, we performed replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations and conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that EF1 and EF2 had β-sheet structure as a secondary structure around the global minimum. However, EF2 had variety of structures around the global minimum compared with EF1 and has easily escaped from the bottom of free energy. The structural fluctuation of the EF1 is smaller than that of the EF2. The structural variation of EF2 is related to these differences in the structural fluctuation and the number of the hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). From the analysis of H-bonds in the β-sheet, the number of H-bonds in EF1 is larger than that in EF2 in the time scale of the conventional MD simulation, suggesting that the formation of H-bonds is related to the differences in the structural fluctuation between EF1 and EF2. From the analysis of other non-covalent interactions in the amino acid sequences of EF1 and EF2, EF1 has three pairs of residues with hydrophobic interaction, and EF2 has two pairs. These results indicate that several non-covalent interactions are important for structural stabilization. Consequently, the structure of EF1 is stabilized by H-bonds and pairs of hydrophobic amino acids in the terminals. Hence, we propose that non-covalent interactions around N-terminal and C-terminal of the peptides are crucial for maintaining the β-sheet structure of the peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2285838044,"The abundant larval transcript (ALT-2) protein is present in all members of the Filarioidea, and has been reported as a potential candidate antigen for a subunit vaccine against lymphatic filariasis. To assess the potential for vaccine escape or heterologous protection, we examined the evolutionary selection acting on ALT-2. The ratios of nonsynonymous (K(a)) to synonymous (K(s)) mutation frequencies (ω) were calculated for the alt-2 genes of the lymphatic filariasis agents Brugia malayi and Wuchereria bancrofti and the agents of river blindness and African eyeworm disease Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa. Two distinct Bayesian models of sequence evolution showed that ALT-2 of W. bancrofti and L. loa were under significant (P<0.05; P < 0.001) diversifying selection, while ALT-2 of B. malayi and O. volvulus were under neutral to stabilizing selection. Diversifying selection as measured by ω values was notably strongest on the region of ALT-2 encoding the signal peptide of L. loa and was elevated in the variable acidic domain of L. loa and W. bancrofti. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the ALT-2 consensus sequences formed three clades: the first consisting of B. malayi, the second consisting of W. bancrofti, and the third containing both O. volvulus and L. loa. ALT-2 selection was therefore not predictable by phylogeny or pathology, as the two species parasitizing the eye were selected differently, as were the two species parasitizing the lymphatic system. The most immunogenic regions of L. loa and W. bancrofti ALT-2 sequence as modeled by antigenicity prediction analysis did not correspond with elevated levels of diversifying selection, and were not selected differently than predicted antigenic epitopes in B. malayi and O. volvulus. Measurements of ALT-2 evolvability made by χ2 analysis between alleles that were stable (O. volvulus and B. malayi) and those that were under diversifying selection (W. bancrofti and L. loa) indicated significant (P<0.01) deviations from a normal distribution for both W. bancrofti and L. loa. The relationship between evolvability and selection in L. loa followed a second order polynomial distribution (R2 = 0.89), indicating that the two factors relate to one another in accordance with an additional unknown factor. Taken together, these findings indicate discrete evolutionary drivers acting on ALT-2 of the four organisms examined, and the described variation has implications for design of novel vaccines and diagnostic reagents. Additionally, this represents the first mathematical description of evolvability in a naturally occurring setting."
https://openalex.org/W2282358702,"Parameters reported in pathologic reviews have been failing to assess exactly the malignant potential of gastrointestinal cancers. We hypothesized that malignant potential could be defined by common latent variables (hypothesis I), but there are substantial differences in the associations between malignant potential and pathologic parameters according to the origin of gastrointestinal cancers (hypothesis II). We shed light on these issues by structural equation modeling.We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 217 esophageal, 192 gastric, and 175 colorectal cancer patients who consecutively underwent curative surgery for their pathologic stage I cancers at Keiyukai Sapporo Hospital. Latent variables identified by factor analysis and seven conventional pathologic parameters were introduced in the structural equation modeling analysis.Because latent variables were disparate except for their number, 'three' in the examined gastrointestinal cancers, the first hypothesis was rejected. Because configural invariance across gastrointestinal cancers was not approved, the second hypothesis was verified. We could trace the three significant paths on the causal graph from latent variables to lymph node metastasis, which were mediated through depth, lymphatic invasion, and matrilysin expression in esophageal cancer, whereas only one significant path could be traced in both gastric and colorectal cancer. Two of the three latent variables were exogenous in esophageal cancer, whereas one factor was exogenous in the other gastrointestinal cancers. Cancer stemness promoted viability in esophageal cancer, but it was suppressed in others.These results reflect the malignant potential of esophageal cancer is higher than that of the other gastrointestinal cancers. Such information might contribute to refining clinical treatments for gastrointestinal cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2283829000,"The β2-integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) plays an important role in the migration, adhesion and intercellular communication of dendritic cells (DCs). During the differentiation of human DCs from monocyte precursors, LFA-1 ligand binding capacity is completely lost, even though its expression levels were remained constant. Yet LFA-1-mediated adhesive capacity on DCs can be regained by exposing DCs to the chemokine CCL21, suggesting a high degree of regulation of LFA-1 activity during the course of DC differentiation. The molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation of LFA-1 function in DCs, however, remain elusive. To get more insight we attempted to identify specific LFA-1 binding partners that may play a role in regulating LFA-1 activity in DCs. We used highly sensitive label free quantitative mass-spectrometry to identify proteins co-immunoprecipitated (co-IP) with LFA-1 from ex vivo generated DCs. Among the potential binding partners we identified not only established components of integrin signalling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins, but also several novel LFA-1 binding partners including CD13, galectin-3, thrombospondin-1 and CD44. Further comparison to the LFA-1 interaction partners in monocytes indicated that DC differentiation was accompanied by an overall increase in LFA-1 associated proteins, in particular cytoskeletal, signalling and plasma membrane (PM) proteins. The here presented LFA-1 interactome composed of 78 proteins thus represents a valuable resource of potential regulators of LFA-1 function during the DC lifecycle."
https://openalex.org/W2273970409,"Background Birth interval is an important and potentially modifiable factor that is associated with child health. Whether an association exists with longer-term outcomes in adults is less well known. Methods Using the 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study, the association of birth interval with markers of cardiovascular health at 30 years of age was examined. Multivariable linear regression was used with birth interval as a continuous variable and categorical variable, and effect modification by gender was explored. Results Birth interval and cardiovascular data were present for 2,239 individuals. With birth interval as a continuous variable, no association was found but stratification by gender tended to show stronger associations for girls. When compared to birth intervals of <18 months, as binary variable, longer intervals were associated with increases in height (1.6 cm; 95% CI: 0.5, 2.8) and lean mass (1.7 kg; 95% CI: 0.2, 3.2). No difference was seen with other cardiovascular outcomes. Conclusions An association was generally not found between birth interval and cardiovascular outcomes at 30 years of age, though some evidence existed for differences between males and females and for an association with height and lean mass for birth intervals of 18 months and longer."
