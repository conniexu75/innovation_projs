https://openalex.org/W1968223204,We have investigated the role of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) in the in vitro splicing of messenger RNA precursors by a variety of procedures. Removal of the U-type snRNPs from the nuclear extracts of HeLa cells with protein A-Sepharose-coupled human autoimmune antibodies leads to complete loss of splicing activity. The inhibition of splicing can be prevented by saturating the coupled antibodies with purified nucleoplasmic U snRNPs prior to incubation with nuclear extract. We further demonstrate that an intact 5' terminus of U1 snRNA is required for the functioning of U1 snRNP in the splicing reaction. Antibodies directed against the trimethylated cap structure of the U snRNAs inhibit splicing. Upon removal of the first eight nucleotides of the U1 snRNA in the particles by site-directed hydrolysis with ribonuclease H in the presence of a synthetic complementary oligodeoxynucleotide splicing is completely abolished. These results are in strong support of current models suggesting that a base-pairing interaction between the 5' terminus of the U1 snRNA and the 5' splice site of a mRNA precursor is a prerequisite for proper splicing.
https://openalex.org/W2051744140,"The structure of rat preproatrial natriuretic factor (preproANF) was determined by nucleotide sequence analysis of an ANF complementary DNA clone. PreproANF is composed of a hydrophobic leader segment (20 amino acids), a precursor containing one glycosylation site (106 amino acids), and ANF (24 amino acids). Atrial natriuretic factor is located at the carboxyl terminus of the precursor molecule. The human, mouse, and rat genomes each contain a single ANF gene which is highly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1522733018,"Protein kinase C phosphorylates different sites on the 20,000-Da light chain of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) than did myosin light chain kinase (Nishikawa, M., Hidaka, H., and Adelstein, R. S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14069-14072). Although protein kinase C incorporates 1 mol of phosphate into 1 mol of 20,000-Da light chain when either HMM or the whole myosin molecule is used as a substrate, it catalyzes the incorporation of up to 3 mol of phosphate/mol of 20,000-Da light chain when the isolated light chains are used as a substrate. Threonine is the major phosphoamino acid resulting from phosphorylation of HMM by protein kinase C. Prephosphorylation of HMM by protein kinase C decreases the rate of phosphorylation of HMM by myosin light chain kinase due to a 9-fold increase of the Km for prephosphorylated HMM compared to that of unphosphorylated HMM. Prephosphorylation of HMM by myosin light chain kinase also results in a decrease of the rate of phosphorylation by protein kinase C due to a 2-fold increase of the Km for HMM. Both prephosphorylations have little or no effect on the maximum rate of phosphorylation. The sequential phosphorylation of HMM by myosin light chain kinase and protein kinase C results in a decrease in actin-activated MgATPase activity due to a 7-fold increase of the Km for actin over that observed with phosphorylated HMM by myosin light chain kinase but has little effect on the maximum rate of the actin-activated MgATPase activity. The decrease of the actin-activated MgATPase activity correlates well with the extent of the additional phosphorylation of HMM by protein kinase C following initial phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1569195670,"Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) is able to catalyze the phosphorylation of phospholamban in a canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum preparation. This phosphorylation is associated with a 2-fold stimulation of Ca2+ uptake by cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum similar to that seen following phosphorylation of phospholamban by an endogenous calmodulin-dependent protein kinase or by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Two-dimensional peptide maps of the tryptic fragments of phospholamban indicate that the three protein kinases differ in their selectivity for sites of phosphorylation. However, one common peptide appears to be phosphorylated by all three protein kinases. These findings suggest that protein kinase C may play a role similar to those played by cAMP- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases in the regulation of Ca2+ uptake by cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, and raise the possibility that the effects of all three protein kinases are mediated through phosphorylation of a common peptide in phospholamban."
https://openalex.org/W1598116581,"Calcium-replete thrombospondin has been purified from outdated platelets using heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, gelatin-Sepharose to remove fibronectin, and gel filtration to eliminate low-molecular-weight heparin-binding proteins. Edman degradation of six different preparations revealed the amino-terminal sequence of thrombospondin (TSP) to be Asn-Arg-Ile-Pro-Glu-Ser-Gly-Gly-Asp-Asn-Ser-Val-Phe-. This sequence was obtained in initial yields as high as 85%, indicating that no blocked chains are present. Cleavage of calcium-replete TSP with thermolysin or plasmin results in the production of relatively stable fragments. Chromatography of these digests on heparin-Sepharose followed by elution with 0.6 M NaCl affords purification of an Mr 25,000 fragment from the thermolysin digest and an Mr 35,000 fragment from the plasmin digest. The binding of these fragments to heparin-Sepharose does not require divalent metal ions. Neither fragment is disulfide-bonded to other fragments present in the digests. The heparin-binding domains from both digests have similar amino acid compositions and their tryptic peptide maps on high performance liquid chromatography are identical with the exception of one peptide unique to each fragment. Automated Edman degradation in a vapor-phase sequenator of the thermolytic heparin-binding domain electroeluted from sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels indicates that the heparin-binding domain resides at the amino terminus of the Mr 180,000 TSP peptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1588987269,"The monosaccharide lipid A precursor, N2,O3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate (Escherichia coli lipid X), has been shown previously to be a potent B-lymphocyte mitogen. We now report that lipid X interacts with macrophages, stimulating turnover of phosphatidylinositol, deacylation of phospholipids, and release of arachidonic acid. In addition, the monosaccharide lipid X, the incomplete lipid A disaccharides found in KDO-deficient mutants, and crude free lipid A by itself activate protein kinase C isolated from RAW 264.7 macrophages. This activation is augmented by diglyceride, a product of phosphatidylinositol turnover. Like the lipid X-induced mitogenesis of B-lymphocytes, lipid X activation of macrophages and the cell-free activation of protein kinase by lipid X require the presence of the O-linked hydroxymyristoyl residue at position 3. We suggest, therefore, that some of the biological effects of lipid A may be mediated by its interaction with protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2011196330,"We have investigated spectrin synthesis and mRNA activity in mice homozygous and heterozygous for six mutations occurring at three distinct loci (nb, ja, sph). When homozygous, these mutations cause severe hemolytic anemias that are characterized by specific spectrin deficiencies. Our results indicate that the primary effect of the nb mutation is a deficiency of another erythrocyte membrane skeletal protein, ankyrin. The severe deficiency of spectrin in the red blood cells of ja/ja mice is the result of a beta spectrin defect. Analysis of spectrin synthesis in mice homozygous and heterozygous for several alleles of sph indicates that the sph locus is the structural gene locus for alpha spectrin. We have mapped the sph locus to mouse Chromosome 1."
https://openalex.org/W1642885008,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation of prolactin secretion from GH3 cells, cloned rat pituitary tumor cells, is associated with 1) hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to yield inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and 2) elevation of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i), caused in part by mobilization of cellular calcium. We demonstrate, in intact cells, that TRH mobilizes calcium and, in permeabilized cells, that InsP3 releases calcium from a nonmitochondrial pool(s). In intact cells, TRH caused a loss of 16 +/- 2.7% of cell-associated 45Ca which was not inhibited by depleting the mitochondrial calcium pool with uncoupling agents. Similarly, TRH caused an elevation of [Ca2+]i from 127 +/- 6.3 nM to 375 +/- 54 nM, as monitored with Quin 2, which was not inhibited by depleting mitochondrial calcium. Saponin-permeabilized cells accumulated Ca2+ in an ATP-dependent manner into a nonmitochondrial pool, which exhibited a high affinity for Ca2+ and a small capacity, and into a mitochondrial pool which had a lower affinity for Ca2+ but was not saturated under the conditions tested. Permeabilized cells buffered free Ca2+ to 129 +/- 9.2 nM when incubated in a cytosol-like solution initially containing 200 to 1000 nM free Ca2+. InsP3, but not other inositol sugars, released calcium from the nonmitochondrial pool(s); half-maximal effect occurred at approximately 1 microM InsP3. Ca2+ release was followed by reuptake into a nonmitochondrial pool(s). These data suggest that InsP3 serves as an intracellular mediator (or second messenger) of TRH action to mobilize calcium from a nonmitochondrial pool(s) leading to an elevation of [Ca2+]i and then to prolactin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1579578057,"A simple and rapid method is described for releasing the epsilon subunit from chloroplast coupling factor 1 by treatment with 20% ethanol on an anion exchange column. The resulting epsilon subunit-deficient enzyme is a permanently active Ca2+-ATPase, but an inactive coupling factor. Recombination with the epsilon subunit returns the enzyme to the latent Ca2+-ATPase state and restores its ability to synthesize ATP when reconstituted with thylakoid membranes. The epsilon subunit is not required for binding coupling factor 1 to the membrane, but its presence is necessary to prevent the leak of protons through the hydrophobic portion of the coupling factor complex."
https://openalex.org/W2056725791,"Int protein has two classes of binding sites within the phage att site: the arm-type recognition sequences are found in three specific sites that are distant from the region of strand exchange; the junction-type recognition sequences occur as inverted pairs around the crossover region in both attP and attB. During recombination between attP and attB each of the four DNA strands is cut at a homologous position within each of the junction-type Int binding sites. In all four junction-type sites Int protein interacts primarily with the same face of the DNA helix, as determined by those purine nitrogens that are protected against methylation by dimethylsulfate. Efficient secondary attachment sites for lambda contain sequences with partial homology to the junction-type binding sites. In addition, the sequence between, but not part of, the two junction-type sites (the overlap region) is strongly conserved in secondary att sites. Thus, in the vicinity of strand exchange, attP and a recombining partner, such as attB, are very similar; each comprises two junction-type Int recognition sites and an overlap (crossover) region."
https://openalex.org/W1606080659,"The correlation between the time courses of actin polymerization under continuous sonication and the associated ATP hydrolysis has been studied. ATP hydrolysis was not mechanistically coupled to polymerization, i.e. not necessary for polymerization, but occurred on F-actin in a subsequent monomolecular reaction. Under sonication, polymerization was complete in 10 s while hydrolysis of ATP on the polymer required 200 s. A value of 0.023 s-1 was found for the first order rate constant of ATP hydrolysis on the polymer at 25 degrees C, pH 7.8, in the presence of 0.2 mM ATP, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2, independent of the F-actin concentration. The conversion of ATP X F-actin to ADP X F-actin was accompanied by an increase in fluorescence of a pyrenyl probe covalently attached to actin, consistent with a 2-fold greater fluorescence for ADP X F-actin than for ATP X F-actin, with a rate constant of 0.022 s-1. In contrast, the fluorescence of F-actin labeled with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzeno-2-oxa-1,3-diazole did not change significantly when ATP or ADP was bound. The direct consequence of the uncoupling between polymerization and ATP hydrolysis is the formation of an ATP cap at the ends of the filaments, which maintains the stability of the polymer, while most of the filament contains bound ADP. The heterogeneity of the filament with respect to ATP and ADP results in a nonlinear relationship between the rate of elongation and the concentration of G-actin with a discontinuity at the critical concentration, where the rate of growth is zero. In this respect, F-actin in ATP behaves similarly to microtubules in GTP."
https://openalex.org/W1570016694,"Comparative measurements were carried out in order to evaluate the significance of intrinsic fluorescence transients with respect to various steps of the catalytic and transport cycle of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase. The enzyme can acquire three levels of intrinsic fluorescence. Level 1 (lowest fluorescence) is observed in the absence of Ca2+ and ATP. Level 2 (highest fluorescence) is induced by Ca2+ through a sequential mechanism including two binding steps interspaced by an isomerization step. This transition occurs more rapidly in the presence of ATP and produces enzyme activation. Level 3 (slightly higher fluorescence than level 1) is observed immediately upon ATP binding (or phosphorylation with Pi) in the absence of Ca2+. When ATP is added to the enzyme X calcium complex, the enzyme is rapidly phosphorylated and the bound calcium is translocated to a position which is protected from La3+ added to the medium. This initial phenomenon is followed by a slow isomerization of the phosphoenzyme which is revealed by a decrease of fluorescence intensity and produces calcium release inside the vesicles before hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphoenzyme. A reaction cycle is considered and subjected to analysis, based on three main enzyme states: E, in the absence of Ca2+; E', in the presence of Ca2+; and *E, subsequent to phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2046156407,"We have shown that in fixed mitotic chromosomes from female G. gerbillus cells the inactive X chromosome is distinctly less sensitive to DNAase I than the active X chromosome, as demonstrated by in situ nick translation. These results indicated that the specific chromatin conformation that renders potentially active genes sensitive to DNAase I is maintained in fixed mitotic chromosomes. We increased the sensitivity and accuracy of in situ nick translation using biotinylated dUTP and a specific detection and staining procedure instead of radioactive label and autoradiography and now show that in both human and CHO chromosomes, the DNAase I sensitive and insensitive chromosomal regions form a specific dark and light banding pattern. The DNAase I sensitive dark D-bands usually correspond to the light G-bands, but not all light G-bands are DNAase I sensitive. Identifiable regions of inactive constitutive heterochromatin are in a DNAase I insensitive conformation. Our methodology provides a new and important tool for studying the structural and functional organization of chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1495691431,"The Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) has been found to phosphorylate and inactivate glycogen synthase. With muscle glycogen synthase as a substrate, the reaction was stimulated by Ca2+ and by phosphatidylserine. The tumor-promoting phorbol esters 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate was also a positive effector, half-maximal activation occurring at 6 nM. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, but not histone, was partially inhibited by glycogen, half-maximally at 0.05 mg/ml, probably via a substrate-directed mechanism. The rate of glycogen synthase phosphorylation was approximately half that for histone; the apparent Km for glycogen synthase was 0.25 mg/ml. Protein kinase C also phosphorylated casein, the preferred substrate among the individual caseins being alpha s1-casein. Glycogen synthase was phosphorylated to greater than 1 phosphate/subunit with an accompanying reduction in the -glucose-6-P/+glucose-6-P activity ratio from 0.9 to 0.5. Phosphate was introduced into serine residues in both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal CNBr fragments of the enzyme subunit. The two main tryptic phosphopeptides mapped in correspondence with the peptides that contain site 1a and site 2. Lesser phosphorylation in an unidentified peptide was also observed. Rabbit liver and muscle glycogen synthases were phosphorylated at similar rates by protein kinase C. The above results are compatible with a role for protein kinase C in the regulation of glycogen synthase as was suggested by a recent study of intact hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1596651894,"Fluorescent probes have been used to measure electrogenic proton pumping by the plasma membrane ATPase of Neurospora. In isolated plasma membrane vesicles, greater than 85% of which are inverted, ATP hydrolysis is accompanied by the formation of an inside acid pH gradient (delta pH) which can be detected by acridine orange fluorescence quenching and an inside positive membrane potential (delta psi) which can be detected by oxonol V fluorescence quenching. Maximal values of delta pH were generated in the presence of a permeant anion (SCN-, NO-3, or Cl-) and maximal delta psi, in the absence of such anions. Cation effects were much less pronounced and can probably be accounted for by non-specific salt effects on the rate of ATP hydrolysis. In addition, a rapid method is described for the reconstitution of the [H+]-ATPase, starting from isolated plasma membranes. When the membranes are solubilized with deoxycholate in the presence of asolectin and detergent is removed by passage through a Bio-Gel P-10 column, vesicles are reformed in which the Mr = 104,000 polypeptide of the ATPase constitutes 35% of the protein. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of the vesicles has revealed intramembrane particles with a diameter of 116 A, equally distributed between the two fracture faces. Measurements with acridine orange and oxonol V indicate that the reconstituted ATPase retains its transport activity, generating both delta pH and delta psi during the hydrolysis of MgATP."
https://openalex.org/W1561703374,"Inactivation of the bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase, taken as alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon with a molecular weight of 375,000, with a 4-fold molar excess of 7-chloro-4-nitro[14C]benzofurazan at pH 7.5, led to the incorporation of 1.42 g atoms of 14C/mol. Treatment of the inactivated enzyme with dithiothreitol removed 0.99 g atom of 14C/mol of enzyme which was accompanied by reactivation of the ATPase. Therefore, of the 1.42 mol of 7-chloro-4-nitro-[14C]benzofurazan incorporated per mol of bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase, 0.43 mol was present on lysine residues and 0.99 mol was present on tyrosine residues. When the inactivated enzyme was treated with 10 mM sodium dithionite at pH 6.0, 10% of the activity was recovered which was accompanied by a 10% loss in covalently bound 14C. Following dithionite treatment, that part of the 14C which remained covalently bound could not be removed by subsequent treatment of the labeled enzyme with dithiothreitol. It is presumed that dithionite reduces the 4-nitro group of the covalently bound reagent, converting it to 4-amino[14C]benzofurazan derivatives at lysine and tyrosine residues. The moles of 4-amino[14C]benzofurazan incorporated per mol of the isolated subunits were: alpha, 0.18; beta, 0.30; gamma, 0.03; and delta plus epsilon, less than 0.01. Gel filtration of a cyanogen bromide digest of the labeled beta subunit on Sephadex G-75 resolved a major 14C peak which contained 83% of the 14C recovered. The major, radioactive tryptic fragment derived from this peak was purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 followed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Automatic Edman degradation of this peptide showed that the 14C was released at the position occupied by beta-Tyr-311."
https://openalex.org/W1574978262,"The purified Ca2+-pumping ATPase of the erythrocyte membrane has been exposed to trypsin at 37 degrees C, in the presence of different effectors of its activity. The control proteolytic pattern is characterized by a number of transient and of limit polypeptides (Zurini, M., Krebs, J., Penniston, J. T., and Carafoli, E. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 618-627). The effectors influence the pattern in the Mr region 90,000-76,000, which contains the calmodulin binding domain and the active site of the enzyme. In this region, polypeptides of 90, 85, 81, and 76 kDa are clearly visible in the controls. 1) Calmodulin plus Ca2+ induces the faster disappearance of the 90-kDa product and the relative accumulation of the 85-kDa with respect to the 81-kDa polypeptide. 2) Vanadate plus Mg2+ also accelerates the disappearance of the 90-kDa product. However, they induce the relative accumulation of the 81-kDa polypeptide. 3) Linoleic acid, which stimulates the activity of the enzyme to the same levels obtained with calmodulin, greatly accelerates the rate of trypsin proteolysis, causing the virtual disappearance of all polypeptides in the 90-76-kDa region. 4) The 81-kDa polypeptide has maximal ATPase activity and is insensitive to calmodulin; the 85-kDa polypeptide has lower ATPase activity and binds calmodulin, but is not stimulated (or is stimulated only negligibly) by the activator."
https://openalex.org/W1602146702,"An improved procedure for the preparation of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) lacking the delta subunit is described. In addition, CF1 deficient in the epsilon subunit was isolated by a new method and CF1 lacking both of the smaller subunits was prepared. The ability of the subunit-deficient forms and of CF1, either heated or incubated with dithiothreitol to activate its ATPase activity, to bind to thylakoids from which CF1 had been removed was studied. All CF1 preparations bound in a cation-dependent manner to similar extents. CF1 lacking the delta subunit required higher cation concentrations for maximal binding. All preparations competed similarly with control CF1 for binding sites on the depleted membranes. The alpha subunit of all forms of CF1 in solution was rapidly cleaved by trypsin. After reconstitution, however, the alpha subunit of CF1, as well as of the subunit-deficient and the activated forms, was resistant to attack by trypsin. Moreover, treatment of the membranes with either trypsin or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibited the binding of all CF1 forms. These results suggest that the binding of the subunit-deficient and activated forms of CF1 is specific. CF1 lacking the epsilon subunit restored neither proton uptake nor ATP synthesis to the depleted membranes. In contrast to our previous results, CF1 lacking the delta subunit was partially effective. Previously, we used a suboptimal Mg2+ concentration for binding the delta-deficient enzyme which we show here was partially deficient in the epsilon subunit. These results show that the delta and epsilon subunits are not required for binding CF1 to the membranes and that the delta subunit is not an absolute requirement for ATP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1534281450,"Biosynthesis, transport, and maturation of cathepsin D and beta-hexosaminidase was examined in fibroblasts exposed to 1-deoxynojirimycin, a glucose analogue known to inhibit trimming glucosidases (Saunier, B., Kilker, R. D., Jr., Tkacz, J. S., Quaroni, A., and Herscovics, A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14155-14161; Hettkamp, H., Bause, E., and Legler, G. (1982) Biosci. Rep. 2, 899-906). Cells treated with 1-deoxynojirimycin contained precursors of cathepsin D and beta-hexosaminidase larger by about 1-2 kDa than control cells. The shift in molecular size was probably due to glucose residues that were rapidly removed from the precursors in the absence but not in the presence of 1-deoxynojirimycin. In addition, 1-deoxynojirimycin inhibited the glycosylation of the beta-chain precursor of beta-hexosaminidase and the synthesis of glycoproteins, including that of cathepsin D. The proteolytic processing of the larger precursors was retarded by several hours. The delay in proteolytic maturation was secondary to the accumulation of the larger precursors in organelles, which fractionated with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. The accumulated cathepsin D precursor contained neither mannose 6-phosphate residues nor complex type oligosaccharides, which are formed in the cis and trans aspects of the Golgi complex. Cathepsin D precursors eventually released from the site of accumulation were apparently deglucosylated, acquired mannose 6-phosphate residues and complex type oligosaccharides, and were transferred into lysosomes as efficiently as in control cells. Our results suggest that transport of cathepsin D from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex depends on removal of glucose residues from its carbohydrate."
https://openalex.org/W1610051602,"The binding of phosphofructokinase and aldolase to the membrane of the intact human erythrocyte was assessed by the rapid hemolysis/filtration method of Kliman and Steck (Kliman, H. J., and Steck, T. L. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6314-6321). We found that about 50% of the phosphofructokinase was membrane-bound in fresh red cells prior to hemolysis. Binding was not significantly altered by deoxygenation. Approximately 40% of aldolase was membrane-associated in fresh red cells. In outdated, blood-banked red cells, aldolase was 73% membrane-bound while, following metabolic repletion, 40% of the enzyme was membrane-associated. These results support the hypothesis that certain glycolytic enzymes in the red cell are membrane-bound in a rapidly reversible and metabolically sensitive fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1591749834,"Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase represents a major enzyme activity in neuronal nuclei. Most of the protein kinase activity is associated with the nuclear matrix but it can phosphorylate a broad range of substrates which derive from different nuclear compartments. Notable among these substrates is a Mr = 50,000 component of the nuclear matrix and a high mobility group chromatin protein which behaves like HMG17. The high level of activity, age- and tissue-specificity, and sensitivity to low concentrations of calmodulin suggest a role for this Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in regulating neuronal function at the level of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1675252915,"Thrombin treatment of the vitamin K-dependent protein S resulted in the loss of the activated protein C cofactor activity associated with protein S. The addition of phospholipid vesicles inhibited the inactivation. Thrombin treatment did not alter the molecular weight of the native protein. However, upon reduction, a peptide of approximately 3000 daltons was released from the treated protein. The interaction between calcium and protein S was reduced by thrombin treatment. When the calcium interaction was determined by the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of protein S, thrombin treatment appeared to inhibit the interaction between calcium and the protein. When the calcium interaction was observed by measuring the effect on the electrophoretic mobility of the protein, thrombin treatment reduced the interaction between calcium and protein S. However, the effect of thrombin treatment on the interaction between calcium and protein S was less than observed by the fluorescent method. This observation suggests that fluorescence quenching may be a result of a structural change induced by calcium binding. Thrombin treatment of protein S appears to uncouple the calcium binding from the structural change. In addition, the interaction between protein S and phospholipid vesicles was reduced by thrombin treatment. These results suggest that the thrombin conversion of protein S into a two-chain protein causes the loss of a calcium-induced change in protein structure, loss of the lipid-binding properties, and the loss of cofactor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1592682842,"We have previously described the kinetics of association of the alpha- and beta-subunits of beta-hexosaminidase A in intact cultured human fibroblasts, using biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation with antisera that distinguish between monomeric and associated alpha-chains (Proia, R. L., d'Azzo, A., and Neufeld, E. F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3350-3354). We now show lack of alpha-beta association in fibroblasts of several individuals deficient in beta-hexosaminidase A (5 patients with nonclassic forms of Tay-Sachs disease and 2 asymptomatic siblings). Defective association was accompanied by markedly reduced (less than one-tenth of normal) conversion of the alpha-chain precursor of Mr = 67,000 to the mature lysosomal form of Mr = 54,000. Analysis by hybridization with fibroblasts lacking the alpha- or beta-chain showed that the association defect resided in the alpha-chain. Most of the cell strains studied also had decreased synthesis of the alpha-chain, suggesting compound heterozygosity with the Ashkenazi Tay-Sachs (no synthesis) allele. An unusual feature of the association defect is the variability in the resulting clinical manifestations, even within families, implying that other factors determine the adequacy of the residual associated beta-hexosaminidase A in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1505126244,"The resolution-reconstitution approach has been employed in order to gain information as to the subunit composition of the Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Proteoliposomes prepared from sonicated asolectin and a highly purified, radiolabeled preparation of the 105,000-dalton hydrolytic moiety of the H+-ATPase by a freeze-thaw procedure catalyze ATP hydrolysis-dependent proton translocation as indicated by the extensive 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine fluorescence quenching that occurs upon the addition of MgATP to the proteoliposomes, and the reversal of this quenching induced by the H+-ATPase inhibitor, vanadate, and the proton conductors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and nigericin plus K+. ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to proton translocation into the liposomes as indicated by the marked stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and nigericin plus K+. The maximum stimulation of ATPase activity by proton conductors is about 3-fold, which indicates that at least two-thirds of the hydrolytically active ATPase molecules present in the reconstituted preparation are capable of translocating protons into the liposomes. Furthermore, as estimated by the extent of protection of the reconstituted 105,000-dalton hydrolytic moiety against tryptic degradation by vanadate in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, the fraction of the total population of ATPase molecules that are hydrolytically active is at least 91%. Taken together, these data indicate that at least 61% of the ATPase molecules present in the reconstituted preparation are able to catalyze proton translocation. This information allows an estimation of the amount of any polypeptide in the preparation that must be present in order for that polypeptide to qualify as a subunit that is required for proton translocation in addition to the 105,000-dalton hydrolytic moiety, and an analysis of the radiolabeled ATPase preparation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea rules out the involvement of any such polypeptides larger than 2,500 daltons. This indicates that the Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase has no subunits even vaguely resembling any that have been found to be associated with other transport ATPases and that if this enzyme has any subunits at all other than the 105,000-dalton hydrolytic moiety, they must be very small."
https://openalex.org/W1566543524,"Chlamydomonas 12 S dynein, which makes up part of the outer arm of the flagellar axoneme, consists of three polypeptides of 330,000, 22,000, and 18,000 daltons. We have used 8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (8-N3ATP), a photoaffinity analog of ATP, to investigate which of the dynein polypeptides contains the site of ATP hydrolysis. 8-N3ATP is a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of ATP by 12 S dynein and is hydrolyzed by 12 S dynein in an ATP- and vanadate-sensitive fashion, indicating that it binds to the 12 S dynein hydrolytic site in the same way as ATP. When dynein was incubated with [gamma-32P]- or [alpha-32P]8-N3ATP in the presence of UV light to activate the azido moiety, the analog was incorporated into 12 S dynein's heavy polypeptide chain, but not its light chains. The incorporation was UV-dependent, was blocked by addition of ATP or vanadate plus ADP to the reaction mixture, and did not occur in heat-denatured dynein.

Cleavage occurred at a limited number of sites without affecting the trimeric structure of the protein. Fragments could be dissociated only by heating in sodium dodecyl sulfate to 100 degrees C. The positions of purified fragments were determined with respect to the uncleaved 421-residue polypeptide by chemical analyses. The regions containing target sites were mapped around residues 159, 203, 245, and 370. Based on kinetics of appearance of the different peptides, early cleavage events occurred at sites near residues 159, 203, and 245 and could be distinguished from late events around residue 370. Information regarding the topological orientation of the cleavage sites could be obtained from the effect of in vitro proteolysis on the ability of the protein to bind phage lambda or monoclonal antibodies. Loss of phage lambda neutralizing activity coincided with early cleavage events, whereas loss of antigenic determinants, known to be exposed at the cell surface, appeared late. Cleavage regions are thus likely to be exposed at the cell surface, a conclusion compatible with the location of mutations affecting the interaction of LamB protein with phage in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W68918070,"In the preceeding paper (Brown, D. R., Roth, M. J., Reinberg, D., and Hurwitz, J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10545-10555), it was shown that following bacteriophage phi X174 (phi X) DNA synthesis in vitro using purified proteins, the phi X A protein could be detected covalently linked to nascent 32P-labeled DNA. This phi X A protein-[32P]DNA complex was the product of the reinitiation reaction. The phi X A protein-[32P]DNA complex could be trapped as a protein-32P-oligonucleotide complex by the inclusion of ddGTP in reaction mixtures. In this report, the structure of the phi X A protein-32P-oligonucleotide complex has been analyzed. The DNA sequence of the oligonucleotide bound to the phi X A protein has been determined and shown to be homologous to the phi X (+) strand sequence immediately adjacent (3') to the replication origin. The phi X A protein was directly linked to the 5' position of a dAMP residue of the oligonucleotide; this residue corresponded to position 4306 of the phi X DNA sequence. The phi X A protein-32P-oligonucleotide complex was exhaustively digested with either trypsin or proteinase K and the 32P-labeled proteolytic fragments were analyzed. Each protease yielded two different 32P-labeled peptides in approximately equimolar ratios. The two 32P-labeled peptides formed after digestion with trypsin (designated T1 and T2) and with proteinase K (designated PK1 and PK2) were isolated and characterized. Digestion of peptide T1 with proteinase K yielded a product which co-migrated with peptide PK2. In contrast, peptide T2 was unaffected by digestion with proteinase K. These results suggest that the phi X A protein contains two active sites that are each capable of binding covalently to DNA. The peptide-mononucleotide complexes T1-[32P]pdA and T2-[32P]pdA were isolated and subjected to acid hydrolysis in 6.0 N HCl. In each case, the major 32P-labeled products were identified as [32P] phosphotyrosine and [32P]Pi. This indicates that each active site of the phi X A protein participates in a phosphodiester linkage between a tyrosyl moiety of the protein and the 5' position of dAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1587627399,"Equilibrium-binding studies at 4 degrees C show that, in the instance of crayfish, troponin C contains only one Ca-binding site with an affinity in the range of physiological free [CA2+] (K = 2 X 10(5) M-1). At physiological levels of Mg2+, this site does not bind Mg2+. In the complexes of troponin C-troponin I, troponin and troponin-tropomyosin, the regulatory Ca-specific site exhibits a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity (K = 2-4 X 10(6) M-1). The latter affinity is reduced to that of troponin C upon incorporation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex into the actin filament (regulated actin), as determined at 4 degrees C by the double isotope technique. The Ca-binding constant is again shifted to a higher value (7 X 10(6) M-1) when regulated actin is associated with nucleotide-free myosin. Both crayfish myofibrils and rabbit actomyosin regulated by crayfish troponin-tropomyosin display a steep rise in ATPase activity with [Ca2+]. Comparison of the pCa/ATPase relationship and the Ca-binding properties at 25 degrees C for the crayfish troponin-regulated actomyosin indicates that while the threshold [Ca2+] for activation corresponds to the range of [Ca2+] where the regulatory site in its low affinity state (K = 1 X 10(5) M-1) starts to bind Ca2+ significantly, full activation is reached at [Ca2+] for which the Ca-specific site in its high affinity state (K = 3 X 10(6) M-1) approaches saturation. These results suggest that, in the actomyosin ATPase cycle, there are at least two calcium-activated states of regulated actin (one low and one high), the high affinity state being induced by interactions of myosin with actin in the cycle."

This new hybrid series can be designated as series. These glycolipids are present in undifferentiated murine leukemia cells. Their concentration declines with differentiation and they are virtually absent in differentiated M1+ cells, suggesting that lacto-ganglio structures could be markers of undifferentiated, malignant myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1590941444,"The DNA polymerase activity of the near homogeneous, multisubunit DNA polymerase-primase from Drosophila melanogaster embryos has been compared to Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III core, DNA polymerase III, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The rate of deoxynucleotide incorporation by the Drosophila polymerase on singly primed phi X174 DNA is similar to that observed with equivalent levels of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in the absence of E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein. However, analysis of the DNA products indicates that the Drosophila polymerase is less processive than DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and closely resembles DNA polymerase III. The Drosophila polymerase-primase contains neither 3'-5' exonuclease nor RNase H-like activities, and catalyzes no significant pyrophosphate exchange. There is a low level of DNA-dependent ATPase activity which can be eliminated by a second glycerol gradient sedimentation (Kaguni, L.S., Rossignol, J.-M., Conaway, R.C., and Lehman, I.R. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 2221-2225). Although lacking a 3'-5' exonuclease, the replication fidelity of the D. melanogaster polymerase is similar to that of E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme which possesses such an activity."
https://openalex.org/W1491414445,"Mitochondrial nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase from beef heart was purified by a novel procedure involving fast protein liquid chromatography and characterized with respect to molecular and catalytic properties. The method is reproducible, gives highly pure transhydrogenase as judged by silver staining, and can be modified to produce large amounts of pure transhydrogenase protein suitable for e.g. sequencing and other protein chemical studies. Transhydrogenase purified by fast protein liquid chromatography is reconstitutively active and pumps protons as indicated by an extensive quenching of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence. Under conditions which generate a proton gradient in the absence of a membrane potential the activity of reconstituted transhydrogenase is close to zero indicating a complete and proper incorporation in the membrane and a preferential regulation of the enzyme by a proton gradient rather than a membrane potential. Treatment of reconstituted transhydrogenase with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide results in an inhibition of proton pump activity without an effect on uncoupled catalytic activity, suggesting that proton translocation and catalytic activities are not obligatory linked or that this agent separates proton pumping from the catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1578714894,"Production of [14C]glucose from [14C]lactate in the perfused livers of 24-h fasted adrenalectomized rats was not stimulated by 1 nM glucagon but was significantly increased by 10 nM hormone. Crossover analysis of glycolytic intermediates in these livers revealed a significant reduction in glucagon action at site(s) between fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as a result of adrenalectomy. Site(s) between pyruvate and P-enolpyruvate was not affected. In isolated hepatocytes, adrenalectomy reduced glucagon response in gluconeogenesis while not affecting glucagon inactivation of pyruvate kinase. A distinct lack of glucagon action on 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity was noted in these cells. When hepatocytes were incubated with 30 mM glucose, lactate gluconeogenesis was greatly stimulated by glucagon. A reduction in both sensitivity and responsiveness to the hormone in gluconeogenesis was seen in the adrenalectomized rat. These changes were well correlated with similar impairment in glucagon action on 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content in hepatocytes from adrenalectomized rats incubated with 30 mM glucose. These results suggest that adrenalectomy impaired the gluconeogenic action of glucagon in livers of fasted rats at the level of regulation of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and/or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content."
https://openalex.org/W1484099713,"The distribution, quantitation, and synthesis of high mobility group (HMG) proteins during spermatogenesis in the rat have been determined. HMG1, -2, -14, and -17 were isolated from rat testes by Bio-Rex 70 chromatography combined with preparative gel electrophoresis. Amino acid analysis revealed that each rat testis HMG protein was similar to its calf thymus analogue. Tryptic peptide maps of somatic and testis HMG2 showed no differences and, therefore, failed to detect an HMG2 variant. Testis levels of HMG proteins, relative to DNA content, were equivalent to other tissues for HMG1 (13 micrograms/mg of DNA), HMG14 (3 micrograms/mg of DNA), and HMG17 (5 micrograms/mg of DNA). The testis was distinguished in that it contained a substantially higher level of HMG2 than any other rat tissue (32 micrograms/mg of DNA). HMG protein levels were determined from purified or enriched populations of testis cells representing the major stages of spermatogenesis; spermatogonia and early primary spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes, early spermatids, and late spermatids; and testicular somatic cells. High levels of HMG2 in the testis were due to pachytene spermatocytes and early spermatids (56 +/- 4 and 47 +/- 6 micrograms/mg of DNA, respectively). Mixtures of spermatogonia and early primary spermatocytes showed lower levels of HMG2 (12 +/- 3 micrograms/mg of DNA) similar to proliferating somatic tissues, whereas late spermatids had no detectable HMG proteins. The somatic cells of the testis, including isolated populations of Sertoli and Leydig cells, showed very low levels of HMG2 (2 micrograms/mg of DNA), similar to those in nonproliferating somatic tissues. HMG proteins were synthesized in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, but not in spermatids. Rat testis HMG2 exhibited two bands on acid-urea gels. A slow form comigrated with somatic cell HMG2, while the other fast band migrated ahead of the somatic form and appeared to be testis-specific. The fast form of HMG2 accounted for the large increase of HMG2 levels in rat testes. These results show that the very high level of HMG2 in testis is not associated with proliferative activity as previously hypothesized."
https://openalex.org/W1481191160,"Abstract Glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb) and glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) form a macromolecular complex on the activated platelet surface which contains the fibrinogen-binding site necessary for normal platelet aggregation. To identify the specific region of the fibrinogen molecule responsible for its interaction with the GPIIb-GPIIIa complex, purified fragment D1 (Mr = 100,000) and fragment E (Mr = 50,000) were prepared from plasmin digests of purified human fibrinogen. In addition, the polypeptide chain subunits A alpha, B beta, and gamma of fibrinogen were prepared. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we have demonstrated that isolated fragment D1 in a solid phase system forms a complex with a mixture of GPIIb and GPIIIa. The binding of the GPIIb-GPIIIa mixture to fragment D1-coated plates reached saturation at 8 nM and to fibrinogen-coated plates at 24 nM. Isolated A alpha, B beta, and gamma chains were not reactive with added glycoproteins. Fragment E coated directly on plastic plates or immobilized on antibody-coated plastic plates did not form a complex with GPIIb-GPIIIa. Only fluid phase fibrinogen and fragment D1 but not fragment E were inhibitory toward formation of a complex between solid phase fibrinogen and GPIIb-GPIIIa. Isolated A alpha, B beta, and gamma chains at concentrations equivalent to fluid phase fibrinogen were inactive. Binding of fragment D1 but not fragment E to the GPIIb-GPIIIa complex was also demonstrated by rocket immunoelectrophoresis of the membrane glycoprotein mixture through a gel containing the individual fragments and subsequent autoradiography of the complex following exposure to 125I-anti-fibrinogen. These observations with isolated platelet membrane glycoproteins provide strong evidence that each of the D domains of the fibrinogen molecule interacts directly with the GPIIb-GPIIIa complex on the activated platelet surface, thus allowing formation of a tertiary molecular bridge across the surface of two adjacent activated platelets."

The effects of these agents on binding correlate with their effects on transcription and on the stability of transcription complexes. Dimethyl sulfoxide stabilizes binding and transcription complexes against dissociation by NaCl, with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide compensating for the addition of 50-60 mM NaCl.

https://openalex.org/W1550149808,"Rat liver microsomal fractions enriched with smooth-surfaced vesicles possess an ATP-supported Ca2+ transport activity, which is stimulated by oxalate and half-maximally activated at 3.5 X 10(-7) M free Ca2+. Catalysis of Ca2+ transport involves transient covalent binding of the terminal phosphate from ATP by the vesicles, resulting in the formation of a Mr 118,000 phosphopeptide, which is acid precipitable and unstable in the presence of hydroxylamine, which may be characteristic for an acylphosphate. Phosphorylation of the Mr 118,000 peptide requires the presence of Ca2+, while dephosphorylation is markedly accelerated by Mg2+. In the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ phosphorylation proceeds much faster than dephosphorylation, indicating that the latter may be rate limiting for the hydrolysis of ATP. The Mr 118,000 peptide is estimated to represent about 2% of total smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein. Comparative studies with sarcoplasmic reticulum from rat skeletal muscle suggest extensive homology of the Ca2+ transport ATPases."

DNA-associated thymidine 5'-aldehyde produced by treatment of DNA with neocarzinostatin chromophore in 2H218O/16O2 or in 2H216O/18O2 was reduced, liberated by nuclease treatment, permethylated, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data clearly show that molecular oxygen is the only source of the 5'-aldehydic oxygen. The addition of molecular oxygen at C-5', possibly via a reactive form of neocarzinostatin chromophore, must be involved; a carbonium ion intermediate at C-5' is ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W1487006471,"The phi X174 (phi X) gene A protein-mediated termination and reinitiation of single-stranded circular (SS(c] phi X viral DNA synthesis in vitro were directly and independently analyzed. Following incubation together with purified DNA replication enzymes from Escherichia coli, ATP, [alpha-32P]dNTPs, and either the phi X A protein and phi X replicative form I (RF I) DNA, or the purified RF II X A complex, the phi X A protein was detected covalently linked to newly synthesized 32P-labeled DNA. Formation of the phi X A protein-[32P]DNA covalent complex required all the factors necessary for phi X (+) SS(c) DNA synthesis in vitro. Thus, it was a product of the reinitiation reaction and an intermediate of the replication cycle. Identification of this complex provided direct evidence that reinitiation of phi X (+) strand DNA synthesis involved regeneration of the RF II X A complex. Substitution of 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine triphosphate (ddGTP) for dGTP in reaction mixtures resulted in the formation of covalent phi X A protein 32P-oligonucleotide complexes; these complexes were trapped analogues of the regenerated RF II X A complex. They could not act catalytically due to the presence of ddGMP residues at the 3'-termini of the oligonucleotide moieties. Reaction mixtures containing ddGTP also yielded nonradioactive (+) SS(c) DNA products derived from circularization of the displaced (+) strand of the input parental template DNA. The formation of the phi X A protein-32P-oligonucleotide complexes and nonradioactive (+) SS(c) DNA were used to assay both reinitiation and termination reactions, respectively. Both reactions required DNA synthesis from the 3'-hydroxyl primer at nucleotide residue 4305 which was formed by cleavage of phi X RF I DNA by the phi X A protein. Elongation of this primer by 18, but not 11 nucleotides was sufficient to support each reaction. Reinitiation reactions proceeded rapidly and were essentially complete after 90 s. In contrast, when ddGTP was replaced with dGTP in reaction mixtures, DNA synthesis proceeded with linear kinetics for up to 10 min. These results suggested that in the presence of all four dNTPs, active templates supported more than 40 rounds of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1594604201,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles of rabbit skeletal muscle are able to accumulate Ca2+ or Sr2+ at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Depending on the conditions used, vesicles loaded with Ca2+ can catalyze either an ATP in equilibrium Pi exchange or the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi. Both reactions are impaired in vesicles loaded with Sr2+. The Sr2+ concentration required for half-maximal ATPase activity increases from 2 microM to 60-70 microM when the Mg2+ concentration is raised from 0.5 to 50 mM. The enzyme is phosphorylated by ATP in the presence of Sr2+. The steady state level of phosphoenzyme varies depending on both the Sr2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in the medium. Phosphorylation of the enzyme by Pi is inhibited by both Ca2+ and Sr2+. In the presence of 2 and 20 mM Mg2+, half-maximal inhibition is attained in the presence of 4 and 8 microM Ca2+ or in the presence of 0.24 mM and more than 2 mM Sr2+, respectively. After the addition of Sr2+, the phosphoenzyme is cleaved with two different rate constants, 0.5-1.5 s-1 and 10-18 s-1. The fraction of phosphoenzyme cleaved at a slow rate is smaller the higher the Sr2+ concentration in the medium. Ca2+ inhibition of enzyme phosphorylation by Pi is overcome by the addition of ITP. This is not observed when Ca2+ is replaced by Sr2+."
https://openalex.org/W1483884869,"Nitrogen starvation has been shown to increase the cytosolic arginine concentration and to accelerate protein turnover in mycelia of Neurospora crassa. The cytosolic arginine is derived from a metabolically inactive vacuolar pool. Redistribution of arginine between cytosolic and vacuolar compartments is the result of mobilization of this metabolite in response to nitrogen starvation. Mobilization of arginine (and purines) also occurred in response to glutamine limitation, but arginine accumulated upon proline starvation. These observations indicate that mobilization is a consequence of glutamine limitation rather than a general response to amino acid starvation (or limitation). Analysis of the amino acid pools in mycelia subjected to starvation or limitation suggests that glutamine (or a metabolite derived from glutamine) provides a signal which determines the metabolic fate of vacuolar arginine. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that vacuolar compartmentation provides a readily available store of nitrogen-rich compounds to be utilized during differentiation or under conditions of nutritional stress."
https://openalex.org/W1583462687,"Abstract The decomposition of the phosphorylated intermediate (EP) of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase, purified by the method of deoxycholic acid extraction, was studied by first phosphorylating with [gamma-32P]ATP, then diluting the reaction mixture with 20 volumes of medium containing nonradioactive ATP, and finally quenching serial samples with acid for determination of residual [32P]EP. The time course of [32P]EP decomposition consists of an initial fast phase followed by a slow phase. The two components of EP, EPfast (1.1 nmol/mg) and EPslow (2.8 nmol/mg), decomposed with the rate constants of 6 and 0.8 min-1, respectively, in the presence of 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5mM MgCl2, and 90 mM KCl at pH 7.0 and O degrees C. The sum of the hydrolytic activities corresponding to the two components accounts for the steady state velocity of the Pi production under the same conditions, indicating that the two components represent simultaneous pathways, rather than sequential steps of EP decomposition. As the time of phosphorylation with [gamma-32P]ATP is increased from 2 to 15 s, the fraction of EPfast decreases in favor of EPslow. This conversion decreases the rate of total Pi production by the enzyme following an initial Pi burst. Conversion of EPfast to EPslow is favored by millimolar concentrations of Ca2+. On the other hand, conversion of EPslow to EPfast is obtained by reducing Ca2+ or raising Mg2+ concentration, but is prevented by removal of ADP. The EPslow fraction decreases in favor of EPfast as the temperature is increased from 0 to 22 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1604990642,"The fluorescent ADP analog, 1,N6-ethenoadenosine diphosphate (epsilon ADP), has been trapped at the active site of myosin subfragment 1 (SF1) by the chromophoric cross - linkers, 1,5 - difluoro - 2,4' - dinitrobenzene (F2DNB) and 4,4'-difluoro-3,3'-dinitrophenylsulfone (F2DPS). The cross-linking agents were shown to react with the kinetically reactive cysteines SH1 and SH2 (i) by virtue of their effect on the characteristic K+-EDTA and CaATPase activities of SF1, (ii) by the loss of two thiols after reaction of enzyme with equimolar concentrations of cross-linking agent, and (iii) by comparison of the uv absorption spectra of cross-linked SF1 with those of the thiol adducts of F2DPS and F2DNB. In addition, F2DPS was shown to be located predominantly on the 20 kDa heavy chain tryptic peptide fragment known to contain SH1 and SH2. The fluorescence decay of the epsilon ADP-SF1 complex was found to be heterogenous by phase modulation methods after reaction with the cross-linking reagents F2DPS and F2DNB. The resolved lifetimes were found to be 26.1 and 7.0 ns for the F2DPS system and 25.2 and 3.1 ns for the F2DNB system, indicating the presence of some free, as well as trapped and quenched, nucleotide in both systems. The shorter lifetimes (Forster energy transfer quenched) and the spectral overlap for the two systems were used to calculate distances of 26 A and 23 A between the purine binding site and the enzyme adducts of F2DPS and F2DNB, respectively. These distance measurements demonstrate that both SH1 and SH2 are too far from the active site to be directly involved in either the binding or the hydrolysis of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1506931074,"We have investigated internal motion of DNA in bacteriophages by measuring fluorescence anisotropy decays of intercalated ethidium. The results showed large suppression of the internal motion of the inner DNA; the interhelix interaction of the DNA in the phage head is considered to enhance the effective viscosity of the DNA rod and to restrict the angle of the internal motion. Considering that the observed internal motion arises mainly from torsional motion of the DNA, we have calculated the movable angles of the torsional motion (the standard deviation of the torsional motion) of the DNA in the phage heads. The magnitude of the calculated movable angles indicates the extent of suppression of the DNA movement in the phage head; in lambda wild type phage, the DNA is packed most rigidly in the head and the motion is found to be restricted most severely. In a deletion mutant of lambda phage, whose inner DNA content is deficient by 17.6%, steric hindrance from the interhelix DNA interaction is decreased, and the DNA can move more easily. In T4 wild type phage, although the extent of condensation of the inner DNA is the same as that in lambda wild type phage, the DNA was fairly mobile. The presence of glucosylated hydroxymethylcytosine is suggested to influence the rigidity of the inner DNA or packaging mode of the DNA in the T4 head."
https://openalex.org/W1545414317,"Acanthamoeba myosin II can be phosphorylated at three serine residues near the C terminus of each heavy chain. Deophosphorylated myosin II has the highest actin-activated ATPase activity. In this paper, we report the interdependent effects of phosphorylation, Mg2+, Ca2+, temperature, pH, and KCl on the acti-activated ATPase activity. With increasing level of phosphorylation, the actin-activated ATPase activity decreases and the optimal concentration of Mg2+ increases. Lowering the temperature of assay from 35 to 20 degrees C reduces the specific activity of dephosphorylated myosin II and increases the optimal Mg2+ concentration. Lowering the pH from 7.7 to 6.4 decreases the optimal Mg2+ concentration for dephosphorylated myosin II but has no effect on its specific activity. Below pH 6.4, the activity of dephosphorylated myosin is decreased. Phosphorylated myosin II, on the other hand, has no actin-activated ATPase activity at pH 6.4 and above, irrespective of the Mg2+ concentration, but has significant activity at lower pH with a maximum at pH 6.0-6.1 in 1 mM Mg2+. Dephosphorylated myosin II requires Mg2+ for actin-activated ATPase activity under all conditions, but Ca2+ can substitute for some of the Mg2+ at pH 7.0. Partial inhibition of dephosphorylated myosin II by 10-15 mM KCl can be overcome by increasing the Mg2+ concentration but the enzyme is 60% inhibited at 25 mM KCl irrespective of the Mg2+ concentration. The actin-activated ATPase activity of maximally dephosphorylated myosin II is as high at pH 6.4, 1 mM Mg2+, and 30 degrees C, which may be near physiological conditions, as at pH 7, 4 mM Mg2+, and 35 degrees C, the assay conditions commonly used previously. Under both conditions, maximally phosphorylated myosin II is inactive. The interdependence of all these effectors emphasizes the ned to employ multiple incubation conditions in assessing the actin-activated ATPase activities of myosins from all sources."

Inhibitory effects on the incorporation of [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein is observed only at concentrations of Cu2+-Alb above 1 mg/ml. Only albumins with a histidine residue at position number 3 (rabbit, human, bovine) which bind one copper molecule at a high affinity site are capable of eliciting Cu2+-dependent suppression. Canine albumin, which has a tyrosine residue at position 3 and does not bind Cu2+, is nonsuppressive . Copper-albumin is suppressive in both the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, thus clearly differentiating its suppressive activity from that of normal human plasma. It is not clear, however, if the Cu2+-Alb chelate is the active suppressive species or whether albumin is more efficient than other Cu2+ chelates in donating Cu2+ to another suppressive molecule. The biological significance of Cu2+-Alb-induced suppression is unknown. Although several possibilities are discussed, the potential to generate artifactual suppression by the formation of Cu2+-Alb chelates as a result of protein isolation procedures using Cu2+-contaminated reagents is considered to be an important potential problem."
https://openalex.org/W1488235230,"Limited digestion of Acanthamoeba myosin II by trypsin selectively cleaved the 185,000-Da heavy chains into a 73,000-Da peptide containing the catalytic and actin-binding sites and a 112,000-Da peptide containing the regulatory phosphorylatable sites. The light chains were unaffected. The proteolytic products remained associated and formed bipolar filaments that were very similar in appearance to filaments of native myosin by negative staining electron microscopy. Filaments of trypsin-cleaved, dephosphorylated myosin, however, had a smaller sedimentation coefficient than filaments of native dephosphorylated myosin. Trypsin-cleaved dephosphorylated myosin retained complete Ca2+-ATPase activity but had no actin-activated ATPase activity under conditions that are optimal for native, dephosphorylated myosin (pH 7.0, 4 mM MgCl2, 30 degrees C or pH 6.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 30 degrees C). Trypsin-cleaved dephosphorylated myosin had higher actin-activated ATPase activity at pH 6.0 and 1 mM MgCl2 than undigested dephosphorylated myosin which is appreciably inhibited under these conditions. Trypsin-cleaved, dephosphorylated myosin inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity of native, dephosphorylated myosin when both were present in the same co-polymers, when enzymatic activity was assayed at pH 7.0, 4 mM MgCl2, and 30 degrees C, but this inhibition was overcome by raising the MgCl2 to 6 mM. These results provide additional evidence that regulation of acanthamoeba myosin II occurs at the filament level and that, under most conditions of assay, the heavy chains must be intact and the regulatory serines unphosphorylated for actin-activated ATPase activity to be maximally expressed."

The amplitudes of the spectral changes upon ternary complex formation were 2-3-fold greater than those generated by formation of binary enzyme-nucleotide and enzyme-folate analog complexes. Difference spectra of the ternary complexes all showed a major increase in absorbance in the region of 320-340 nm, presumably due to perturbations of the folate analog chromophores, whereas decreases in absorbance occurred over a range of 260-310 nm. N-10-ethyl-quinazoline tended to form the complex with the greatest filtration efficiency on nitrocellulose filters, followed by folic acid triglutamate and folic acid, whereas among the nucleotides, the most stable complexes were formed with FdUMP, followed by dUMP and dTMP. A correlation was observed between the apparent stability of the ternary complex and the magnitude of the absorbance change in its difference spectrum. The formation of the various ternary complexes showed three different categories of rate behavior: 1) very rapid formation of the complex; 2) biphasic formation with a rapid phase and a slow phase requiring up to 90 min for completion; and 3) in the case of the ternary complex formed with enzyme, FdUMP, and folic acid, only a slow phase of binding. The slow formation of the latter complex was accompanied by concomitantly slow changes in the difference spectrum. However, in those cases of biphasic formation of the complexes, almost all of the spectral change occurred rapidly, and very little of it corresponded to the slow phase of complex formation. To accommodate these observations, a model is proposed involving a sequential interaction of the two subunits of thymidylate synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1597736901,"The structure of adult bovine articular cartilage high density proteoglycans (PG-I) was studied by degradation with Pronase, chondroitinase ABC, and alkaline borohydride treatments and fractionation and analysis of the products. The keratan sulfate (KS) peptides were rich in glutamic acid, proline, and serine and had a low glycine content. The chondroitin sulfate (CS) peptides had a high content of serine, glycine, and glutamic acid and a much lower proline content than the KS peptides. The data indicate that the KS and CS chains occur in more distinct regions of the protein core(s) than in bovine nasal cartilage PG. After alkaline borohydride treatment there was an almost quantitative conversion of xylose to xylitol and galactosaminitol was the only hexosaminitol detected in KS fractions. The results obtained indicated that the alkali-labile bonds linking the CS and KS chains are the same as those reported to occur in other cartilage PGs. The Mr of the KS chains calculated from the glucosamine and galactosaminitol contents gave values of 6,000-7,000, although gel chromatography and light scattering measurements indicated considerable heterogeneity. The KS and CS chains were quantitatively precipitated by cetylpyridinium chloride and the KS and a portion (15%) of the CS chains were found to be soluble in 1% cetylpyridinium chloride. The abnormal solubility properties of the CS chains in the presence of 1% cetylpyridinium chloride is thought to be due to their low sulfate content. The molecular weight of the remainder of the CS chains, based on the ratio of xylitol to galactosamine, varied from 6,500 to 16,000. The low Mr CS chains were rich in 6-sulfated disaccharides whereas the higher Mr chains had a higher content of 4-sulfated disaccharides. The ratio of galactose to xylitol also varied with Mr. These results indicate similarities in the structure of the adult bovine articular cartilage PG-Is to other cartilage high density PGs. The heterogeneities observed in the composition of the KS and CS chains, and their occurrence in relatively distinct regions of the protein core(s) indicate, however, that there is still much to be learned about the structure of these complex macromolecules."
