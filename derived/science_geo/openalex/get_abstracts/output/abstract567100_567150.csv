https://openalex.org/W2513680795,"Solid oxide cells (SOCs) can operate with high efficiency in two ways-as fuel cells, oxidizing a fuel to produce electricity, and as electrolysis cells, electrolysing water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases. Ideally, SOCs should perform well, be durable and be inexpensive, but there are often competitive tensions, meaning that, for example, performance is achieved at the expense of durability. SOCs consist of porous electrodes-the fuel and air electrodes-separated by a dense electrolyte. In terms of the electrodes, the greatest challenge is to deliver high, long-lasting electrocatalytic activity while ensuring cost- and time-efficient manufacture. This has typically been achieved through lengthy and intricate ex situ procedures. These often require dedicated precursors and equipment; moreover, although the degradation of such electrodes associated with their reversible operation can be mitigated, they are susceptible to many other forms of degradation. An alternative is to grow appropriate electrode nanoarchitectures under operationally relevant conditions, for example, via redox exsolution. Here we describe the growth of a finely dispersed array of anchored metal nanoparticles on an oxide electrode through electrochemical poling of a SOC at 2 volts for a few seconds. These electrode structures perform well as both fuel cells and electrolysis cells (for example, at 900 °C they deliver 2 watts per square centimetre of power in humidified hydrogen gas, and a current of 2.75 amps per square centimetre at 1.3 volts in 50% water/nitrogen gas). The nanostructures and corresponding electrochemical activity do not degrade in 150 hours of testing. These results not only prove that in operando methods can yield emergent nanomaterials, which in turn deliver exceptional performance, but also offer proof of concept that electrolysis and fuel cells can be unified in a single, high-performance, versatile and easily manufactured device. This opens up the possibility of simple, almost instantaneous production of highly active nanostructures for reinvigorating SOCs during operation."

In this work, we study how the same contents (videos) are consumed on different platforms -- i.e. Facebook and YouTube -- over a sample of $12M$ of users. Our findings show that the same content lead to the formation of echo chambers, irrespective of the online social network and thus of the algorithm for content promotion. Finally, we show that the users' commenting patterns are accurate early predictors for the formation of echo-chambers."
https://openalex.org/W2511488239,"Integrin-based adhesions play critical roles in cell migration. Talin activates integrins and flexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby serving as a 'molecular clutch' that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions (FAs). Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs, which we term the FA belt, and in central sliding adhesions, where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino-terminal (KN) motif and induce talin and integrin activation. In addition, Kank proteins diminish the talin-actomyosin linkage, which curbs force transmission across integrins, leading to reduced integrin-ligand bond strength, slippage between integrin and ligand, central adhesion formation and sliding, and reduced cell migration speed. Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin-talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity."
https://openalex.org/W2511184432,"Zonulin protein is a newly discovered modulator which modulates the permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier by disassembling intercellular tight junctions (TJ). Disruption of TJ is associated with neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It has been shown bifidobacterium could protect the intestinal barrier function and prophylactical administration of bifidobacterium has beneficial effects in NEC patients and animals. However, it is still unknown whether the zonulin is involved in the gut barrier dysfunction of NEC, and the protective mechanisms of bifidobacterium on intestinal barrier function are also not well understood. The present study aims to investigate the effects of bifidobacterium on intestinal barrier function, zonulin regulation, and TJ integrity both in LPS-induced enterocyte barrier injury of Caco-2 monolayers and in a rat NEC model. Our results showed bifidobacterium markedly attenuated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in paracellular permeability in the Caco-2 monolayers treated with LPS (P < 0.01). Compared with the LPS group, bifidobacterium significantly decreased the production of IL-6 and TNF-α (P < 0.01) and suppressed zonulin release (P < 0.05). In addition, bifidobacterium pretreatment up-regulated occludin, claudin-3 and ZO-1 expression (P < 0.01) and also preserved these proteins localization at TJ compared with the LPS group. In the in vivo study, bifidobacterium decreased the incidence of NEC from 88 to 47% (P < 0.05) and reduced the severity in the NEC model. Increased levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in the ileum of NEC rats were normalized in bifidobacterium treated rats (P < 0.05). Moreover, administration of bifidobacterium attenuated the increase in intestinal permeability (P < 0.01), decreased the levels of serum zonulin (P < 0.05), normalized the expression and localization of TJ proteins in the ileum compared with animals with NEC. We concluded that bifidobacterium may protect against intestinal barrier dysfunction both in vitro and in NEC. This protective effect is associated with inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine secretion, suppression of zonulin protein release and improvement of intestinal TJ integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2518316517,"Insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells is primarily regulated by glucose; however, hormones and additional nutrients, such as long-chain fatty acids, also play an important role in adjusting insulin output to physiologic needs. To examine the role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in β-cell function, we analyzed mouse models of gain and loss of function of GPR41 (FFAR3), a receptor for SCFAs, vs. wild-type control mice. GPR41 gain of function [GPR41-overexpressing transgenic (41 Tg) model] and GPR41 loss of function [GPR41-knockout (KO 41) model] resulted in complementary changes in glucose tolerance, without significant effects on insulin sensitivity. KO 41 mice showed fasting hypoglycemia, which was consistent with increased basal and glucose-induced insulin secretion by islets in vitro Mirroring this, 41 Tg islets showed impaired glucose responsiveness in vitro Microarray analysis of islets from 41 Tg mice indicated significant alterations in gene expression patterns; several of the altered genes were chosen for further analysis and were also observed to change upon incubation of islets‏‏ and cultured β-cells with SCFAs in a GPR41-dependent manner. Taken together, our results indicate that GPR41 and its ligands, SCFAs, may play an important role in the fine-tuning of insulin secretion in fed and fasting states.-Veprik, A., Laufer, D., Weiss, S., Rubins, N., Walker, M. D. GPR41 modulates insulin secretion and gene expression in pancreatic β-cells and modifies metabolic homeostasis in fed and fasting states."
https://openalex.org/W2518122161,"Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of important infectious diseases, causing millions of deaths every year and endangering approximately 3 billion people around the world. As such, precise identification of mosquito species is crucial for an understanding of epidemiological patterns of disease transmission. Currently, the most common method of mosquito identification relies on morphological taxonomic keys, which do not always distinguish cryptic species. However, wing geometric morphometrics is a promising tool for the identification of vector mosquitoes, sibling and cryptic species included. This study therefore sought to accurately identify mosquito species from the three most epidemiologically important mosquito genera using wing morphometrics. Twelve mosquito species from three epidemiologically important genera (Aedes, Anopheles and Culex) were collected and identified by taxonomic keys. Next, the right wing of each adult female mosquito was removed and photographed, and the coordinates of eighteen digitized landmarks at the intersections of wing veins were collected. The allometric influence was assessed, and canonical variate analysis and thin-plate splines were used for species identification. Cross-validated reclassification tests were performed for each individual, and a Neighbor Joining tree was constructed to illustrate species segregation patterns. The analyses were carried out and the graphs plotted with TpsUtil 1.29, TpsRelw 1.39, MorphoJ 1.02 and Past 2.17c. Canonical variate analysis for Aedes, Anopheles and Culex genera showed three clear clusters in morphospace, correctly distinguishing the three mosquito genera, and pairwise cross-validated reclassification resulted in at least 99% accuracy; subgenera were also identified correctly with a mean accuracy of 96%, and in 88 of the 132 possible comparisons, species were identified with 100% accuracy after the data was subjected to reclassification. Our results showed that Aedes, Culex and Anopheles were correctly distinguished by wing shape. For the lower hierarchical levels (subgenera and species), wing geometric morphometrics was also efficient, resulting in high reclassification scores."

https://openalex.org/W2511661767,"Many studies show that open access (OA) articles-articles from scholarly journals made freely available to readers without requiring subscription fees-are downloaded, and presumably read, more often than closed access/subscription-only articles. Assertions that OA articles are also cited more often generate more controversy. Confounding factors (authors may self-select only the best articles to make OA; absence of an appropriate control group of non-OA articles with which to compare citation figures; conflation of pre-publication vs. published/publisher versions of articles, etc.) make demonstrating a real citation difference difficult. This study addresses those factors and shows that an open access citation advantage as high as 19% exists, even when articles are embargoed during some or all of their prime citation years. Not surprisingly, better (defined as above median) articles gain more when made OA."
https://openalex.org/W2513121575,"Understanding the cellular mechanisms of tumour growth is key for designing rational anticancer treatment. Here we used genetic lineage tracing to quantify cell behaviour during neoplastic transformation in a model of oesophageal carcinogenesis. We found that cell behaviour was convergent across premalignant tumours, which contained a single proliferating cell population. The rate of cell division was not significantly different in the lesions and the surrounding epithelium. However, dividing tumour cells had a uniform, small bias in cell fate so that, on average, slightly more dividing than non-dividing daughter cells were generated at each round of cell division. In invasive cancers induced by Kras(G12D) expression, dividing cell fate became more strongly biased towards producing dividing over non-dividing cells in a subset of clones. These observations argue that agents that restore the balance of cell fate may prove effective in checking tumour growth, whereas those targeting cycling cells may show little selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2514454573,"Organisms in hot environments will not be able to passively dissipate metabolically generated heat. Instead, they have to revert to evaporative cooling, a process that is energetically expensive and promotes excessive water loss. To alleviate these costs, birds in captivity let their body temperature increase, thereby entering a state of hyperthermia. Here we explore the use of hyperthermia in wild birds captured during the hot and dry season in central Nigeria. We found pronounced hyperthermia in several species with the highest body temperatures close to predicted lethal levels. Furthermore, birds let their body temperature increase in direct relation to ambient temperatures, increasing body temperature by 0.22°C for each degree of increased ambient temperature. Thus to offset the costs of thermoregulation in ambient temperatures above the upper critical temperature, birds are willing to let their body temperatures increase by up to 5°C above normal temperatures. This flexibility in body temperature may be an important mechanism for birds to adjust to predicted increasing ambient temperatures in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2432487998,"Recent advances in the urban science make broad use of the notion of scaling. We focus here on the important scaling relationship between the gross metropolitan product (GMP) of a city and its population (pop). It has been demonstrated that GMP ∝ Y Ypopβ with β always greater than 1 and close to 1.2. This fundamental finding highlights a universal rule that holds across countries and cultures and might explain the very nature of cities. However, in an increasingly connected world, the hypothesis that the economy of a city solely depends on its population might be questionable. Using data for 248 cities in the European Union between 2005 and 2010, we found a double GMP/pop scaling regime. For West EU cities, β = 1 over the whole the period, while for post-communist cities β > 1 and increases from ∼1.2 to ∼1.4. The evolution of the scaling exponent describes the convergence of post-communist European cities to open and liberal economies. We propose a simple model of economic convergence in which, under stable political conditions, a linear GMP/pop scaling is expected for all cities. The results suggest that the GMP/pop super-linear scaling represents a phase of economic growth rather than a steady, universal urban feature. The results also suggest that relationships between cities are embedded in their political and economic context and cannot be neglected in explanations of cities, urbanization and urban economics."
https://openalex.org/W2508689061,"Age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction is the underlying cause of morbidity that affects up to half the population aged 80 and over. Considerable evidence indicates that oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to the sarcopenic phenotype that occurs with aging. To examine this, we administered the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone mesylate {[10-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-methyl-3,6-dioxo-1,4-cyclohexadien-1-yl)decyl] triphenylphosphonium; 100 μM} to wild-type C57BL/6 mice for 15 wk (from 24 to 28 mo of age) and investigated the effects on age-related loss of muscle mass and function, changes in redox homeostasis, and mitochondrial organelle integrity and function. We found that mitoquinone mesylate treatment failed to prevent age-dependent loss of skeletal muscle mass associated with myofiber atrophy or alter a variety of in situ and ex vivo muscle function analyses, including maximum isometric tetanic force, decline in force after a tetanic fatiguing protocol, and single-fiber-specific force. We also found evidence that long-term mitoquinone mesylate administration did not reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species or induce significant changes in muscle redox homeostasis, as assessed by changes in 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts, protein carbonyl content, protein nitration, and DNA damage determined by the content of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. Mitochondrial membrane potential, abundance, and respiration assessed in permeabilized myofibers were not significantly altered in response to mitoquinone mesylate treatment. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that long-term mitochondria-targeted mitoquinone mesylate administration failed to attenuate age-related oxidative damage in skeletal muscle of old mice or provide any protective effect in the context of muscle aging.-Sakellariou, G. K., Pearson, T., Lightfoot, A. P., Nye, G. A., Wells, N., Giakoumaki, I. I., Griffiths, R. D., McArdle, A., Jackson, M. J.

In the skeleton, circadian rhythm helps coordinate bone formation and resorption. Circadian rhythm is regulated through transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback loops that include microRNAs. How microRNAs regulate circadian rhythm in bone is unexplored. We show that in mouse calvaria, miR-433 displays robust circadian rhythm, peaking just after dark. In C3H/10T1/2 cells synchronized with a pulse of dexamethasone, inhibition of miR-433 using a tough decoy altered the period and amplitude of Per2 gene expression, suggesting that miR-433 regulates rhythm. Although miR-433 does not directly target the Per2 3′-UTR, it does target two rhythmically expressed genes in calvaria, Igf1 and Hif1α. miR-433 can target the glucocorticoid receptor; however, glucocorticoid receptor protein abundance was unaffected in miR-433 decoy cells. Rather, miR-433 inhibition dramatically enhanced glucocorticoid signaling due to increased nuclear receptor translocation, activating glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional targets.

We hypothesize that miR-433 helps maintain circadian rhythm in osteoblasts by regulating sensitivity to glucocorticoid receptor signaling. The circadian rhythm is an internal timing mechanism important for orchestrating physiological homeostasis, through synchronizing behavioral and physiological patterns. This coordinates biological processes critical for overall health, such as tissue repair and growth, maintenance of the immune response, and optimization of metabolism. The circadian rhythm is driven by a complex interaction between the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), 4The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; miRNA, microRNA; ZT, Zeitgeber time; BMSC, bone marrow stromal cell; Dox, doxycycline; HDAC, histone deacetylase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid response element. also known as the central clock, and the peripheral circadian clocks. As the central oscillator, the SCN responds to environmental periodic cues, such as light, eating patterns, and temperature. In response to these cues, the SCN entrains peripheral circadian clocks through stimulation of neural or hormonal signals (e.g. glucocorticoids) to enact their effects on target tissues (1Gimble J.M. Floyd Z.E. Bunnell B.A. The 4th dimension and adult stem cells: can timing be everything?.J. Cell Biochem. 2009; 107: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the central oscillator and peripheral tissues, the rhythm is maintained locally by clock genes that interact through transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback loops. The main positive regulators are aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl or Bmal1) and circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock), which are negatively regulated by the period genes (Per1, Per2, and Per3) and the cryptochrome genes (Cry1 and Cry2), among others (for a review, see Ref. 2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Coordination of circadian timing in mammals.Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). Bmal1 and Clock form a heterodimer and bind to E-box elements of target genes, including the Per and Cry genes, to rhythmically induce transcription. PER/CRY can negatively feedback to inhibit their own transcription as well as the transcription of Bmal1/Clock, ensuring the anti-phasic expression of clock proteins. This interaction between the clock proteins determines the oscillatory expression of target genes and contributes to the rhythmicity of physiological systems (3Eckel-Mahan K. Sassone-Corsi P. Metabolism and the circadian clock converge.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 107-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Bone is a continuously remodeling tissue, and disturbances in circadian rhythm have a negative impact on skeletal health (4Witt-Enderby P.A. Slater J.P. Johnson N.A. Bondi C.D. Dodda B.R.

Bone remodeling is the coupled cycle of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption followed by osteoblast-mediated bone formation. This process is critical for renewal of bone in adults and for mineral homeostasis. Imbalance in the bone remodeling process can lead to prevalent diseases, such as osteoporosis. In osteoblasts, 26% of genes display a diurnal expression pattern, including the master osteoblast transcription factor Runt-related transcriptional factor 2 (Runx2), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2), osteocalcin (Oc, Bglap), insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) (4Witt-Enderby P.A.

Evidence suggests that, in humans, circadian rhythm coordinates bone remodeling so that it occurs primarily at night. For example, bone formation markers, such as serum osteocalcin, as well as serum markers of type I collagen synthesis, the major protein component of bone matrix, are highest in premenopausal women at night (7Hassager C.

Moreover, serum levels of glucocorticoids, which are known to play an important role in synchronizing peripheral clocks, are critical for the diurnal variation in serum osteocalcin (9Heshmati H.M.

These short (19–25-nucleotide) non-coding RNAs bind specific target mRNAs, resulting in mRNA degradation and/or translational suppression. Many miRNAs fine tune the timing and tempo of gene expression programs, and these post-transcriptional regulators are an important component of circadian clock control. Indeed, miRNAs display circadian rhythmicity in many tissues, including the liver, retina, and SCN (10Vollmers C. Schmitz R.J. Nathanson J. Yeo G. Ecker J.R. Panda S.

Alternatively, miRNAs can indirectly control circadian rhythm by targeting downstream regulators, as is the case for miR-122 targeting of nocturnin, a key circadian deadenylase (13Kojima S.

MicroRNA-122 modulates the rhythmic expression profile of the circadian deadenylase Nocturnin in mouse liver.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e11264Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Conversely, clock genes can directly regulate miRNA expression; for example, BMAL1/CLOCK induces expression of miR-219, and in vivo miR-219 knockdown results in a lengthened circadian period (14Cheng H.Y.

Obrietan K. microRNA modulation of circadian-clock period and entrainment.Neuron. 2007; 54: 813-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). miRNA regulation of circadian rhythm in the skeleton has not been reported. However, within the adrenal gland, miR-433 was recently shown to target the glucocorticoid receptor (GR; Nr3c1) 3′-UTR (15Riester A. Issler O. Spyroglou A. Rodrig S.H. Chen A. Beuschlein F. ACTH-dependent regulation of microRNA as endogenous modulators of glucocorticoid receptor expression in the adrenal gland.Endocrinology. 2012; 153: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Rhythmic secretion of glucocorticoids is critical for synchronizing local clocks in peripheral tissues, in part by activating transcription of Per genes (16Reddy T.E. Gertz J. Crawford G.E. Garabedian M.J. Myers R.M. The hypersensitive glucocorticoid response specifically regulates period 1 and expression of circadian genes.Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 3756-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, as circulating glucocorticoid levels fluctuate diurnally, so does the sensitivity of tissues to glucocorticoids (17Nicolaides N.C. Charmandari E. Chrousos G.P. Kino T. Recent advances in the molecular mechanisms determining tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids: novel mutations, circadian rhythm and ligand-induced repression of the human glucocorticoid receptor.BMC Endocr. Disord. 2014; 14: 71Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that miR-433 regulates glucocorticoid signaling and impacts the expression of the circadian clocks and osteoblastic genes in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether miR-433 might play a role in osteoblast circadian rhythm, we first determined whether it is under circadian regulation in the skeleton. RNA was isolated from calvaria of male mice kept under a 12-h light/dark cycle, represented as Zeitgeber time (ZT). ZT0 is the beginning of light exposure, whereas ZT12 is the beginning of light removal. Examining two markers of circadian rhythm, Bmal1 and Per2, over two 24-h cycles, these two circadian genes displayed the expected anti-phasic pattern of expression throughout each 24-h cycle. For example, Bmal1 mRNA expression was highest at ZT1, whereas Per2 mRNA was low; the nadir for Bmal1 mRNA was just before light removal, whereas Per2 mRNA had its peak expression just after dark (Fig. 1A). We analyzed the expression of three microRNAs, miR-433, miR-29a, and miR-30a, because they were either shown to display rhythmic expression in other tissues or were predicted via bioinformatics analysis to potentially target the glucocorticoid receptor or circadian clock genes (10Vollmers C. Schmitz R.J. Nathanson J. Yeo G. Ecker J.R. Panda S. Circadian oscillations of protein-coding and regulatory RNAs in a highly dynamic mammalian liver epigenome.Cell Metab. 2012; 16: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). miR-433 displayed robust rhythmicity in mouse calvaria (Fig. 1B). The miR-433 expression pattern was anti-phasic in relation to Bmal1 mRNA, peaking at 4-fold after light removal and decreasing as night progressed. miR-29a and miR-30a expression peaked at ZT17, but the amplitude of their rhythm was more modest in comparison with miR-433 (Fig. 1B). We also examined the mRNA expression of osteogenic genes previously reported to display circadian rhythmicity in vivo (4Witt-Enderby P.A. Slater J.P. Johnson N.A. Bondi C.D. Dodda B.R. Kotlarczyk M.P. Clafshenkel W.P. Sethi S. Higginbotham S. Rutkowski J.L. Gallagher K.M. Davis V.L.

Both Runx2 and Igf1 mRNAs appeared to peak early in the day, whereas Hif1α mRNA displayed a broad peak during each 24-h cycle (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) mRNA did not display rhythmic expression in calvaria (Fig. 1D). To better understand the role of miR-433 in circadian rhythm, we used a well established protocol in which the multipotent mouse C3H/10T1/2 cell line and primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were synchronized with a pulse of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (18Wu X. Yu G. Parks H. Hebert T. Goh B.C. Dietrich M.A. Pelled G. Izadpanah R. Gazit D. Bunnell B.A. Gimble J.M. Circadian mechanisms in murine and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells following dexamethasone exposure.Bone. 2008; 42: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Merrill G.F. Cell synchronization.Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 57: 229-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, C3H/10T1/2 cells and BMSCs were serum-deprived for 24 h and then treated with a 2-h pulse of 100 nm dexamethasone. The dexamethasone was removed (time 0) and replaced with serum-free medium, and RNA was collected for up to 48 h (Fig. 1E). The C3H/10T1/2 cells remained synchronized for 48 h, whereas the BMSCs only remained synchronized for ∼30 h. Bmal1 and Per2 mRNA expression displayed rhythmic and anti-phasic expression patterns in both C3H/10T1/2 cells and BMSCs, confirming synchronization of the cultures (Fig. 1, F and H). However, miR-433 did not display rhythmicity in either cell type, suggesting that a systemic factor establishes miR-433 rhythm in vivo (Fig. 1, G and I). To determine whether miR-433 may directly target the circadian clocks, we employed a bioinformatic approach using several online databases (miRanda, TargetScan, and RNAhybrid) to examine complementarity of the miR-433 seed binding region to the 3′-UTR of clock mRNAs (20Betel D. Koppal A. Agius P. Sander C. Leslie C. Comprehensive modeling of microRNA targets predicts functional non-conserved and non-canonical sites.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 21Lewis B.P. Burge C.B.

Steffen P. Hochsmann M. Giegerich R. Fast and effective prediction of microRNA/target duplexes.RNA. 2004; 10: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar). Of the circadian clock genes, only Per2 contained a potential miR-433 binding site at position 1829 (Fig. 2A). Runx2, Hif1α, and Igf1 are rhythmically expressed genes in bone. Whereas Runx2 was previously confirmed as a miR-433 target (23Kim E.J. Kang I.H. Lee J.W. Jang W.G. Koh J.T. MiR-433 mediates ERRγ-suppressed osteoblast differentiation via direct targeting to Runx2 mRNA in C3H10T1/2 cells.Life Sci. 2013; 92: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Hif1α and Igf1 had yet to be examined. The Hif1α 3′-UTR contained two potential miR-433 binding sites at positions 352 and 879; the Igf1 3′-UTR contained two potential sites at 4237 and 6113 (Fig. 2A). To determine whether Per2, Igf1, and Hif1α were miR-433 targets, target gene 3′-UTRs were cloned downstream of a constitutively expressed luciferase gene in the reporter plasmid pMIR-REPORT. The luciferase constructs containing the target 3′-UTRs were transiently co-transfected into C3H/10T1/2 cells with a non-targeting or miR-433 inhibitor, and luciferase activity was quantified. miR-433 inhibition significantly increased the luciferase activity of Hif1α and Igf1 constructs compared with the non-targeting control, but it did not affect Per2 3′-UTR activity (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that miR-433 directly targets Igf1 and Hif1α but not Per2. To better study the impact of miR-433 on circadian rhythm, we developed a stably transduced C3H/10T1/2 cell line in which the activity of miR-433 could be knocked down in an inducible manner. We used a previously described lentiviral knockdown (pSLIK) system that allows for tight regulation of transgene expression via a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoter (24Shin K.J. Wall E.A. Zavzavadjian J.R. Santat L.A. Liu J. Hwang J.I. Rebres R. Roach T. Seaman W. Simon M.I. Fraser I.D. A single lentiviral vector platform for microRNA-based conditional RNA interference and coordinated transgene expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13759-13764Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To achieve knockdown of miR-433 activity, we created a miR-433 tough decoy, in which a gfp (green fluorescent protein) reporter carries two miR-433 binding sites in its 3′-UTR (supplemental Fig. S1A and Fig. 3A) (25Haraguchi T. Ozaki Y. Iba H. Vectors expressing efficient RNA decoys achieve the long-term suppression of specific microRNA activity in mammalian cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The miR-433 tough decoy contains a secondary structure that enhances resistance to degradation. When transcribed, the miR-433 tough decoy acts as a competitive inhibitor for endogenous miR-433, therefore relieving suppression of its targets. As a control, a C3H/10T1/2 cell line was also established expressing a Dox-inducible non-targeting tough decoy construct. To confirm doxycycline-inducible expression of the transgene, we quantified GFP mRNA in the non-targeting and miR-433 decoy cells treated for 24 h with increasing doses of Dox. Dox induced gfp mRNA in both non-targeting and miR-433 decoy cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). To confirm that the decoy inhibited miR-433 actions, we examined luciferase activity of the target 3′-UTR constructs that were previously studied using the transiently transfected miR-433 inhibitor. In these experiments, the miR-433 decoy phenocopied the effects observed with transiently transfected miR-433 inhibitor, with similar increases in luciferase activity with Igf1 and Hif1α 3′-UTR reporter constructs but no change with Per2 (Fig. 3C). In miR-433 decoy cells, we also examined mRNA levels for a previously defined miR-433 target Runx2 (23Kim E.J. Kang I.H. Lee J.W. Jang W.G. Koh J.T. MiR-433 mediates ERRγ-suppressed osteoblast differentiation via direct targeting to Runx2 mRNA in C3H10T1/2 cells.Life Sci. 2013; 92: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as Igf1 and Hif1α. Runx2, Igf1, and Hif1α mRNA levels were significantly increased after a 24-h treatment with 1000 ng/ml Dox in the miR-433 decoy cells but not in the non-targeting decoy cells (Fig. 3, D–F). In contrast, Per2 mRNA was unaffected at any dose tested (Fig. 3G). Analysis of miR-433 decoy cells at additional time points after Dox treatment also failed to demonstrate significant differences in Per2 mRNA (data not shown), confirming that Per2 is not a miR-433 target. Overall, these data demonstrate that the miR-433 decoy inhibits miR-433 activity. Although miR-433 did not display a cell-autonomous rhythm in vitro, it is possible that this miRNA could still play a role in maintenance or regulation of rhythm. To examine this in vitro, non-targeting and miR-433 decoy cells were synchronized with a short pulse of dexamethasone, in the presence or absence of Dox. In the synchronized non-targeting decoy cells, both Bmal1 and Per2 mRNA displayed two peaks within the 48-h interval. Treatment of the non-targeting decoy cells with Dox did not affect the rhythmicity of either Bmal1 or Per2 mRNA (Fig. 4, A and C). However, in cells expressing the miR-433 decoy, the first peak in Bmal1 mRNA was shifted from 6 to 12 h (Fig. 4B), and the amplitude of the peaks was decreased. For Per2 mRNA, the effect of miR-433 inhibition was more striking. In miR-433 decoy cells treated with Dox, Per2 mRNA levels were significantly higher at time 0, and the phase of the Per2 rhythm was shifted (Fig. 4D). Like Bmal1, the amplitude of Per2 mRNA peaks was decreased in the presence of the miR-433 decoy (Fig. 4D). Glucocorticoids play a prominent role in synchronizing the peripheral clocks, in part by activating transcription of Per genes (16Reddy T.E. Gertz J. Crawford G.E. Garabedian M.J. Myers R.M. The hypersensitive glucocorticoid response specifically regulates period 1 and expression of circadian genes.Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 3756-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, as circulating glucocorticoids levels fluctuate diurnally, so does the sensitivity of tissues to glucocorticoids. Because miR-433 was previously shown by others to target the glucocorticoid receptor 3′-UTR (15Riester A. Issler O. Spyroglou A. Rodrig S.H. Chen A. Beuschlein F. ACTH-dependent regulation of microRNA as endogenous modulators of glucocorticoid receptor expression in the adrenal gland.Endocrinology. 2012; 153: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and because our cell cultures were synchronized using dexamethasone, we hypothesized that miR-433 could help maintain circadian rhythm in cells of the osteoblastic lineage through regulation of glucocorticoid signaling. Dusp1 and Per2 are both direct transcriptional targets of the glucocorticoid receptor, and we used their mRNA levels as markers of glucocorticoid signaling (16Reddy T.E. Gertz J. Crawford G.E. Garabedian M.J. Myers R.M. The hypersensitive glucocorticoid response specifically regulates period 1 and expression of circadian genes.Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 3756-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Shipp L.E. Lee J.V. Yu C.Y. Pufall M. Zhang P. Scott D.K. Wang J.C. Transcriptional regulation of human dual specificity protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) gene by glucocorticoids.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e13754Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In C3H/10T1/2 cells, dexamethasone induced Dusp1 mRNA at 1–3 h, whereas the increase in Per2 was more transient, peaking at 2 h (Fig. 5, A and B). To determine whether miR-433 regulated the sensitivity of cells to glucocorticoids, we examined Dusp1 and Per2 mRNA in miR-433 decoy cells treated for 2 h with vehicle or dexamethasone, in the absence or presence of Dox. In the absence of miR-433 decoy, dexamethasone caused a modest increase in Per2 mRNA, independent of the dose used (Fig. 5C). In contrast, expression of the miR-433 decoy augmented the induction of Per2 mRNA and caused a dose-responsive increase. In the absence of miR-433 decoy, 10 or 100 nm dexamethasone increased Dusp1 mRNA ∼6-fold (Fig. 5D). Expression of the miR-433 decoy further enhanced Dusp1 mRNA at both 10 and 100 nm dexamethasone (Fig. 5D). Because inhibition of miR-433 activity allowed the cells to become responsive to higher levels of glucocorticoids, it is possible that miR-433 functions to limit exposure of cells to excessive glucocorticoid signaling. We next examined whether miR-433 could regulate the temporal response to glucocorticoid signaling. miR-433 decoy cells were treated with vehicle or 100 nm dexamethasone for up to 4 h, in the absence or presence of Dox, to induce expression of the decoy. In the absence of Dox, dexamethasone increased Per2 mRNA at 2 h of treatment (Fig. 5F). However, when the miR-433 decoy was expressed, the dexamethasone-mediated induction of Per2 mRNA was accelerated such that Per2 mRNA was significantly increased after only 1 h of treatment, and its peak expression at 2 h was enhanced. Similarly, in the absence of Dox, dexamethasone modestly increased Dusp1 mRNA after 1 h of treatment in miR-433 decoy cells (Fig. 5H). However, expression of the miR-433 decoy significantly enhanced Dusp1 mRNA levels at 1–3 h of treatment with dexamethasone. In contrast, in non-targeting decoy cells, the effects of dexamethasone on Per2 and Dusp1 mRNAs were similar in the presence or absence of Dox (Fig. 5, E and G). These data confirm that miR-433 confines glucocorticoid responsiveness. To determine how miR-433 might regulate sensitivity to glucocorticoid signaling, we first examined the impact of the miR-433 decoy on glucocorticoid receptor mRNA (Nr3c1) and protein levels. To mimic the conditions of the circadian synchronization experiments, we performed these studies in cells cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of Dox and then treated with 100 nm dexamethasone for 2 h. In non-targeting decoy cells, culture in the presence or absence of Dox did not affect mRNA or protein levels of Nr3c1 (Fig. 6, A and D). In contrast, miR-433 decoy cells treated with Dox displayed a 3-fold induction of Nr3c1 mRNA (Fig. 6A). However, significant differences in total GR protein levels were not observed at any time point measured (Fig. 6D). It is possible that inhibition of miR-433 alters GR mRNA translation efficiency, perhaps by indirectly modifying the complement of miRNAs or RNA-binding proteins interacting with the transcript. GR protein stability could also be affected because GR is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Overall, these data suggest that an increase in total glucocorticoid receptor levels was not responsible for the increased sensitivity to dexamethasone. Alternative forms of the mouse glucocorticoid receptor, GRα or GRβ, are generated by alternative splicing (27Hinds Jr., T.D. Ramakrishnan S. Cash H.A. Stechschulte L.A. Heinrich G. Najjar S.M.

Lifelong retention in care is essential to its success. We conducted a discrete choice experiment in Ethiopia and Mozambique to identify health system characteristics preferred by HIV-infected women to promote continuity of care. Methods Women living with HIV and receiving care at hospitals in Oromia Region, Ethiopia and Zambézia Province, Mozambique were shown nine choice cards and asked to select one of two hypothetical health facilities, each with six varying characteristics related to the delivery of HIV services for long term treatment. Mixed logit models were used to estimate the influence of six health service attributes on choice of clinics. Results 2,033 women participated in the study (response rate 97.8% in Ethiopia and 94.7% in Mozambique). Among the various attributes of structure and content of lifelong ART services, the most important attributes identified in both countries were respectful provider attitude and ability to obtain non-HIV health services during HIV-related visits. Availability of counseling support services was also a driver of choice. Facility type, i.e., hospital versus health center, was substantially less important. Conclusions Efforts to enhance retention in HIV care and treatment for pregnant women should focus on promoting respectful care by providers and integrating access to non-HIV health services in the same visit, as well as continuing to strengthen counseling."
https://openalex.org/W2512675037,"Recently, we have shown that high fat diet (HFD) in vivo and in vitro generates metabolic memory by altering H3K36me2 and H3K27me3 on the promoter of FOXO1 (transcription factor of gluconeogenic genes) (Kumar, S., Pamulapati, H., and Tikoo, K. (2016) Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 422, 233-242). Here we checked the hypothesis whether concomitant diet reversal and metformin could overcome HFD-induced metabolic memory and renal damage. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered insulin-resistant by feeding high fat diet for 16 weeks. Then the rats were subjected to diet reversal alone and along with metformin for 8 weeks. Biochemical and histological markers of insulin resistance and kidney function were measured. Blood pressure and in vivo vascular reactivity to angiotensin II (200 ng kg-1) were also checked. Diet reversal could improve lipid profile but could not prevent renal complications induced by HFD. Interestingly, metformin along with diet reversal restored the levels of blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. In kidney, metformin increased the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and decreased inflammatory markers (COX-2 and IL-1β) and apoptotic markers (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase 3). Metformin was effective in lowering elevated basal blood pressure and acute change in mean arterial pressure in response to angiotensin II (Ang II). It also attenuated tubulointerstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis induced by HFD feeding in kidney. Here we report, for the first time, that metformin treatment overcomes metabolic memory and prevents HFD-induced renal damage."

From this initial cohort, we created 4 subcohorts with at least one prescription (filled or not) from each therapeutic group (antiplatelet, beta-blockers, ACEI/ARB, statins) within the first 3 months after discharge. Monthly adherence was defined as having ≥24 days covered out of 30, leading to a repeated binary outcome measure. We assessed the membership to trajectory groups of adherence using group-based trajectory models. We also analyzed predictors of the different adherence patterns using multinomial logistic regression.We identified a maximum of 5 different adherence patterns: 1) Nearly-always adherent patients; 2) An early gap in adherence with a later recovery; 3) Brief gaps in medication use or occasional users; 4) A slow decline in adherence; and 5) A fast decline. These patterns represented variable proportions of patients, the descending trajectories being more frequent for the beta-blocker and ACEI/ARB cohorts (16% and 17%, respectively) than the antiplatelet and statin cohorts (10% and 8%, respectively). Predictors of poor or intermediate adherence patterns were having a main diagnosis of unstable angina or other forms of CHD vs. AMI in the index hospitalization, being born outside Spain, requiring copayment or being older.Distinct adherence patterns over time and their predictors were identified. This may be a useful approach for targeting improvement interventions in patients with poor adherence patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2514296195,"WHO's new classification in 2009: dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue, has necessitated large numbers of admissions to hospitals of dengue patients which in turn has been imposing a huge economical and physical burden on many hospitals around the globe, particularly South East Asia and Malaysia where the disease has seen a rapid surge in numbers in recent years. Lack of a simple tool to differentiate mild from life threatening infection has led to unnecessary hospitalization of dengue patients.We conducted a single-centre, retrospective study involving serologically confirmed dengue fever patients, admitted in a single ward, in Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Data was collected for 4 months from February to May 2014. Socio demography, co-morbidity, days of illness before admission, symptoms, warning signs, vital signs and laboratory result were all recorded. Descriptive statistics was tabulated and simple and multiple logistic regression analysis was done to determine significant risk factors associated with severe dengue.657 patients with confirmed dengue were analysed, of which 59 (9.0%) had severe dengue. Overall, the commonest warning sign were vomiting (36.1%) and abdominal pain (32.1%). Previous co-morbid, vomiting, diarrhoea, pleural effusion, low systolic blood pressure, high haematocrit, low albumin and high urea were found as significant risk factors for severe dengue using simple logistic regression. However the significant risk factors for severe dengue with multiple logistic regressions were only vomiting, pleural effusion, and low systolic blood pressure. Using those 3 risk factors, we plotted an algorithm for predicting severe dengue. When compared to the classification of severe dengue based on the WHO criteria, the decision tree algorithm had a sensitivity of 0.81, specificity of 0.54, positive predictive value of 0.16 and negative predictive of 0.96.The decision tree algorithm proposed in this study showed high sensitivity and NPV in predicting patients with severe dengue that may warrant admission. This tool upon further validation study can be used to help clinicians decide on further managing a patient upon first encounter. It also will have a substantial impact on health resources as low risk patients can be managed as outpatients hence reserving the scarce hospital beds and medical resources for other patients in need."

Der p 18-specific IgG antibodies were produced in rabbits to localize the allergen in mites using immunogold electron microscopy and to search for cross-reactive allergens in other allergen sources (i.e. mites, crustacea, mollusca and insects). IgE reactivity of rDer p 18 was tested with sera from clinically well characterized HDM-allergic patients (n = 98) and its allergenic activity was analyzed in basophil activation experiments.Recombinant Der p 18 was expressed and purified as a folded, biologically active protein. It shows weak chitin-binding activity and partial cross-reactivity with Der f 18 from D. farinae but not with proteins from the other tested allergen sources. The allergen was mainly localized in the peritrophic matrix of the HDM gut and to a lower extent in fecal pellets. Der p 18 reacted with IgE from 10% of mite allergic patients from Austria and showed allergenic activity when tested for basophil activation in Der p 18-sensitized patients.Der p 18 is a rather genus-specific minor allergen with weak chitin-binding activity but exhibits allergenic activity and therefore should be included in diagnostic test panels for HDM allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2512267046,"Lipids have an important role in many aspects of cell biology, including membrane architecture/compartment formation, intracellular traffic, signalling, hormone regulation, inflammation, energy storage and metabolism. Lipid biology is therefore integrally involved in major human diseases, including metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, heart disease, immune disorders and cancers, which commonly display altered lipid transport and metabolism. However, the investigation of these important cellular processes has been limited by the availability of specific tools to visualise lipids in live cells. Here we describe the potential for ReZolve-L1™ to localise to intracellular compartments containing polar lipids, such as for example sphingomyelin and phosphatidylethanolamine. In live Drosophila fat body tissue from third instar larvae, ReZolve-L1™ interacted mainly with lipid droplets, including the core region of these organelles. The presence of polar lipids in the core of these lipid droplets was confirmed by Raman mapping and while this was consistent with the distribution of ReZolve-L1™ it did not exclude that the molecular probe might be detecting other lipid species. In response to complete starvation conditions, ReZolve-L1™ was detected mainly in Atg8-GFP autophagic compartments, and showed reduced staining in the lipid droplets of fat body cells. The induction of autophagy by Tor inhibition also increased ReZolve-L1™ detection in autophagic compartments, whereas Atg9 knock down impaired autophagosome formation and altered the distribution of ReZolve-L1™. Finally, during Drosophila metamorphosis fat body tissues showed increased ReZolve-L1™ staining in autophagic compartments at two hours post puparium formation, when compared to earlier developmental time points. We concluded that ReZolve-L1™ is a new live cell imaging tool, which can be used as an imaging reagent for the detection of polar lipids in different intracellular compartments."

https://openalex.org/W2510379005,"Polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) each give rise to a vast array of complex bioactive molecules with further complexity added by the existence of natural PKS-NRPS fusions. Rational genetic engineering for the production of natural product derivatives is desirable for the purpose of incorporating new functionalities into pre-existing molecules, or for optimization of known bioactivities. We sought to expand the range of natural product diversity by combining modules of PKS-NRPS hybrids from different hosts, hereby producing novel synthetic natural products. We succeeded in the construction of a functional cross-species chimeric PKS-NRPS expressed in Aspergillus nidulans. Module swapping of the two PKS-NRPS natural hybrids CcsA from Aspergillus clavatus involved in the biosynthesis of cytochalasin E and related Syn2 from rice plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae lead to production of novel hybrid products, demonstrating that the rational re-design of these fungal natural product enzymes is feasible. We also report the structure of four novel pseudo pre-cytochalasin intermediates, niduclavin and niduporthin along with the chimeric compounds niduchimaeralin A and B, all indicating that PKS-NRPS activity alone is insufficient for proper assembly of the cytochalasin core structure. Future success in the field of biocombinatorial synthesis of hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides relies on the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of inter-modular polyketide chain transfer. Therefore, we expressed several PKS-NRPS linker-modified variants. Intriguingly, the linker anatomy is less complex than expected, as these variants displayed great tolerance with regards to content and length, showing a hitherto unreported flexibility in PKS-NRPS hybrids, with great potential for synthetic biology-driven biocombinatorial chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2511421811,"Harlequin Ichthyosis is a severe skin disease caused by mutations in the human gene encoding ABCA12. Here, we characterize a novel mutation in intron 29 of the mouse Abca12 gene that leads to the loss of a 5’ splice donor site and truncation of the Abca12 RNA transcript. Homozygous mutants of this smooth skin or smsk allele die perinatally with shiny translucent skin, typical of animal models of Harlequin Ichthyosis. Characterization of smsk mutant skin showed that the delivery of glucosylceramides and CORNEODESMOSIN was defective, while ultrastructural analysis revealed abnormal lamellar bodies and the absence of lipid lamellae in smsk epidermis. Unexpectedly, mutant stratum corneum remained intact when subjected to harsh chemical dissociation procedures. Moreover, both KALLIKREIN 5 and -7 were drastically decreased, with retention of desmoplakin in mutant SC. In cultured wild type keratinocytes, both KALLIKREIN 5 and -7 colocalized with ceramide metabolites following calcium-induced differentiation. Reducing the intracellular levels of glucosylceramide with a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor resulted in decreased secretion of KALLIKREIN proteases by wild type keratinocytes, but not by smsk mutant keratinocytes. Together, these findings suggest an essential role for ABCA12 in transferring not only lipids, which are required for the formation of multilamellar structures in the stratum corneum, but also proteolytic enzymes that are required for normal desquamation. Smsk mutant mice recapitulate many of the pathological features of HI and can be used to explore novel topical therapies against a potentially lethal and debilitating neonatal disease."

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous product rich in growth factors, and therefore able to promote tissue regeneration and angiogenesis. This product has proven its efficacy in multiple studies, but has not yet been tested on kidney tissue. The aim of this work is to evaluate whether the application of PRP to rat kidneys undergoing ischemia-reperfusion reduces mid-term kidney damage. A total of 30 monorrenal Sprague-Dawley male rats underwent renal ischemia-reperfusion for 45 minutes. During ischemia, PRP (PRP Group, n = 15) or saline solution (SALINE Group, n = 15) was administered by subcapsular renal injection. Control kidneys were the contralateral organs removed immediately before the start of ischemia in the remaining kidneys. Survival, body weight, renal blood flow on Doppler ultrasound, kidney weight, kidney volume, blood biochemistry and histopathology were determined for all subjects and kidneys, as applicable. Correlations between these variables were searched for. The PRP Group showed significantly worse kidney blood flow (p = 0.045) and more histopathological damage (p<0.0001). Correlations were found between body weight, kidney volume, kidney weight, renal blood flow, histology, and serum levels of creatinine and urea.

Recent advances in next generation sequencing improved also the quality and quantity of individual B cell receptors repertoire sequencing. Unfortunately, appropriate software to exhaustively analyze repertoire data from NGS platforms without limitations of the number of sequences are lacking. Here we introduce a new R package, bcRep, which offers a platform for comprehensive analyses of B cell receptor repertoires, using IMGT/HighV-QUEST formatted data. Methods for gene usage statistics, clonotype classification, as well as diversity measures, are included. Furthermore, functions to filter datasets, to do summary statistics about mutations, as well as visualization methods, are available. To compare samples in respect of gene usage, diversity, amino acid proportions, similar sequences or clones, several functions including also distance measurements, as well as multidimensional scaling methods, are provided."
https://openalex.org/W2511087383,"Exosomes are small membrane vesicles released by different cell types, including hepatocytes, that play important roles in intercellular communication. We have previously demonstrated that hepatocyte-derived exosomes contain the synthetic machinery to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in target hepatocytes resulting in proliferation and liver regeneration after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We also demonstrated that the chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, regulate liver recovery and regeneration after I/R injury. In the current study, we sought to determine if the regulatory effects of CXCR1 and CXCR2 on liver recovery and regeneration might occur via altered release of hepatocyte exosomes. We found that hepatocyte release of exosomes was dependent upon CXCR1 and CXCR2. CXCR1-deficient hepatocytes produced fewer exosomes, whereas CXCR2-deficient hepatocytes produced more exosomes compared to their wild-type controls. In CXCR2-deficient hepatocytes, there was increased activity of neutral sphingomyelinase (Nsm) and intracellular ceramide. CXCR1-deficient hepatocytes had no alterations in Nsm activity or ceramide production. Interestingly, exosomes from CXCR1-deficient hepatocytes had no effect on hepatocyte proliferation, due to a lack of neutral ceramidase and sphingosine kinase. The data demonstrate that CXCR1 and CXCR2 regulate hepatocyte exosome release. The mechanism utilized by CXCR1 remains elusive, but CXCR2 appears to modulate Nsm activity and resultant production of ceramide to control exosome release. CXCR1 is required for packaging of enzymes into exosomes that mediate their hepatocyte proliferative effect."

To get an insight in the effect of NTRK1 mutations in the cognitive phenotype we biochemically characterized three TrkA mutations identified in children diagnosed of CIPA with variable ID. These mutations are located in different domains of the protein; L213P in the extracellular domain, Δ736 in the kinase domain, and C300stop in the extracellular domain, a new mutation causing CIPA diagnosed in a Spanish teenager. We found that TrkA mutations induce misfolding, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and aggregation in a mutation-dependent manner. The distinct mutations are degraded with a different kinetics by different ER quality control mechanisms; although C300stop is rapidly disposed by autophagy, Δ736 degradation is sensitive to the proteasome and to autophagy inhibitors, and L213P is a long-lived protein refractory to degradation. In addition L213P enhances the formation of autophagic vesicles triggering an increase in the autophagic flux with deleterious consequences. Mouse cortical neurons expressing L213P showed the accumulation of LC3-GFP positive puncta and dystrophic neurites. Our data suggest that TrkA misfolding and aggregation induced by some CIPA mutations disrupt the autophagy homeostasis causing neurodegeneration. We propose that distinct disease-causing mutations of TrkA generate different levels of cell toxicity, which may provide an explanation of the variable intellectual disability observed in CIPA patients.

https://openalex.org/W2507483319,"Both myoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) take part in the muscle tissue regeneration and have been used as experimental cellular therapy in muscular disorders treatment. It is possible that co-transplantation approach could improve the efficacy of this treatment. However, the relations between those two cell types are not clearly defined. The aim of this study was to determine the reciprocal interactions between myoblasts and MSC in vitro in terms of the features important for the muscle regeneration process. Primary caprine muscle-derived cells (MDC) and bone marrow-derived MSC were analysed in autologous settings. We found that MSC contribute to myotubes formation by fusion with MDC when co-cultured directly, but do not acquire myogenic phenotype if exposed to MDC-derived soluble factors only. Experiments with exposure to hydrogen peroxide showed that MSC are significantly more resistant to oxidative stress than MDC, but a direct co-culture with MSC does not diminish the cytotoxic effect of H2O2 on MDC. Cell migration assay demonstrated that MSC possess significantly greater migration ability than MDC which is further enhanced by MDC-derived soluble factors, whereas the opposite effect was not found. MSC-derived soluble factors significantly enhanced the proliferation of MDC, whereas MDC inhibited the division rate of MSC. To conclude, presented results suggest that myogenic precursors and MSC support each other during muscle regeneration and therefore myoblasts-MSC co-transplantation could be an attractive approach in the treatment of muscular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2512229439,"Although the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase, DUSP1, mediates dexamethasone-induced repression of MAPKs, 14 of 46 interleukin-1β (IL1B)-induced mRNAs were significantly enhanced by DUSP1 overexpression in pulmonary A549 cells. These include the interferon regulatory factor, IRF1, and the chemokine, CXCL10. Of these, DUSP1-enhanced mRNAs, 10 including CXCL10, were IRF1-dependent. MAPK inhibitors and DUSP1 overexpression prolonged IRF1 expression by elevating transcription and increasing IRF1 mRNA and protein stability. Conversely, DUSP1 silencing increased IL1B-induced MAPK phosphorylation while significantly reducing IRF1 protein expression at 4 h. This confirms a regulatory network whereby DUSP1 switches off MAPKs to maintain IRF1 expression. There was no repression of IRF1 expression by dexamethasone in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, and in A549 cells IL1B-induced IRF1 protein was only modestly and transiently repressed. Although dexamethasone did not repress IL1B-induced IRF1 protein expression at 4–6 h, silencing of IL1B plus dexamethasone-induced DUSP1 significantly reduced IRF1 expression. IL1B-induced expression of CXCL10 was largely insensitive to dexamethasone, whereas other DUSP1-enhanced, IRF1-dependent mRNAs showed various degrees of repression. With IL1B plus dexamethasone, CXCL10 expression was also IRF1-dependent, and expression was reduced by DUSP1 silencing. Thus, IL1B plus dexamethasone-induced DUSP1 maintains expression of IRF1 and the IRF1-dependent gene, CXCL10. This is supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation showing IRF1 recruitment to be essentially unaffected by dexamethasone at the CXCL10 promoter or at the promoters of more highly repressed IRF1-dependent genes. Since IRF1-dependent genes, such as CXCL10, are central to host defense, these data may help explain the reduced effectiveness of glucocorticoids during asthma exacerbations.

Since IRF1-dependent genes, such as CXCL10, are central to host defense, these data may help explain the reduced effectiveness of glucocorticoids during asthma exacerbations. Inhaled glucocorticoids are referred to clinically as inhaled corticosteroids and bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR 2The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; DUSP1, dual-specificity phosphatase 1; Ad5, adenovirus serotype 5; HBE, human bronchial epithelial; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; TLR, Toll-like receptor; UBD, ubiquitin D; qPCR, quantitative PCR; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; ANOVA, analysis of variance. ; NR3C1). These drugs suppress inflammatory gene expression and are a mainstay in the treatment of asthma (1Barnes P.J. Glucocorticosteroids: current and future directions.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2011; 163: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, poor responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroid therapy by asthmatics with neutrophilic inflammation or viral infections and by individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) necessitates high, often oral, doses of glucocorticoid (1Barnes P.J.

This, if maintained over prolonged periods, may lead to contraindications, including osteoporosis, muscle wasting, increased blood glucose, weight gain, and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (4Schäcke H. Döcke W.D. Asadullah K. Mechanisms involved in the side effects of glucocorticoids.Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 96: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Thus, an unmet clinical need exists to improve the therapeutic ratio of glucocorticoids in such disease situations. Airway epithelial cells release proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes and play critical roles in asthma (5Wang Y. Bai C. Li K. Adler K.B. Wang X. Role of airway epithelial cells in development of asthma and allergic rhinitis.Respir. Med. 2008; 102: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Acting on the airway epithelium, glucocorticoids suppress the production of numerous epithelial-derived mediators, and this helps to reduce inflammatory cell recruitment (1Barnes P.J. Glucocorticosteroids: current and future directions.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2011; 163: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, epithelial cells also produce antimicrobial, complement, and other mediators that play pivotal roles in innate immune and host defense responses (6Diamond G. Legarda D. Ryan L.K. The innate immune response of the respiratory epithelium.Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 7Schleimer R.P. Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation but spare innate immune responses in airway epithelium.Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2004; 1: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many of these factors are spared the repressive effects of glucocorticoids, and this may contribute toward the maintenance of innate immune responses (7Schleimer R.P. Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation but spare innate immune responses in airway epithelium.Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2004; 1: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, by enhancing the expression of scavenger and toll-like receptors (TLRs), collectins, complement factors, and other antimicrobial and antiviral proteins, glucocorticoids may induce protective innate and host defense responses (8Ehrchen J. Steinmüller L. Barczyk K. Tenbrock K. Nacken W. Eisenacher M. Nordhues U. Sorg C. Sunderkötter C. Roth J.

Gene profiling reveals unknown enhancing and suppressive actions of glucocorticoids on immune cells.FASEB J. 2002; 16: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Increased expression of the dual-specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase, DUSP1, and the consequent reduction of MAPK activity by glucocorticoids is often regarded as a key anti-inflammatory effector mechanism leading to reduced inflammatory gene expression (10Clark A.R. Martins J.R. Tchen C.R. Role of dual specificity phosphatases in biological responses to glucocorticoids.J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2014; 724: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the up-regulation of host defense and anti-viral response genes, and loss of MAPK activity and/or increased DUSP1 expression is associated with enhanced expression of IRF1 and IRF1-dependent genes, such as IL12 (12Korhonen R.

Thus, a loss of MAPK activity could contribute to the maintenance of IRF1 expression in the presence of glucocorticoids. This may play a role in glucocorticoid insensitivity, and indeed enhanced expression of IRF1 is implicated in reduced responsiveness to glucocorticoids (18Tliba O. Damera G. Banerjee A. Gu S.

In a prior analysis, expression of many mRNAs, including IRF1, were induced by 1 h of IL1B treatment, whereas other genes, for example the complement factor, CFB, were induced after a delay of 1–2 h (20King E.M. Chivers J.E. Rider C.F. Minnich A. Giembycz M.A. Newton R.

While investigating DUSP1 as a glucocorticoid effector, DUSP1 was overexpressed, and this profoundly repressed the expression of many inflammatory genes, including IL8 and CSF2 (GM-CSF) (21King E.M.

However, we now show that many IL1B-induced genes, including CFB, CXCL10 (proinflammatory chemokine), IFIT1 (tetratricopeptide repeat containing-antiviral gene), MX1 (guanosine triphosphate-metabolizing antiviral protein, UBD (ubiquitin D), were, along with IRF1, substantially enhanced by DUSP1 overexpression. Since, complementary effects occur in DUSP1 knock-out mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, a general feature of gene regulation is suggested (24Chi H. Barry S.P. Roth R.J. Wu J.J.

As the majority of these, IL1B-induced, DUSP1-enhanced genes are late-phase genes, we hypothesize that the ability of DUSP1 to enhance IRF1 expression is responsible for the increased expression of late-phase genes, such as CFB or CXCL10. Furthermore, because glucocorticoids induce DUSP1 expression, this mechanism could contribute to glucocorticoid insensitivity. These concepts are explored using pulmonary A549 cells as a model of primary human bronchial epithelial cells, in which DUSP1 is induced by glucocorticoids and inflammatory gene expression is induced by IL1B and repressed by glucocorticoids (22Newton R.

To test the effect of DUSP1 overexpression, 46 transcripts were selected as IL1B-inducible in a prior microarray analysis performed in A549 cells (20King E.M. Chivers J.E. Rider C.F. Minnich A. Giembycz M.A. Newton R. Glucocorticoid repression of inflammatory gene expression shows differential responsiveness by transactivation- and transrepression-dependent mechanisms.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e53936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These were supplemented with CXCL10 and TLR2, which were selected based on a negative role for MAPK pathways in their regulation (13Zaheer R.S. Proud D.

Although control virus had little or no effect on IL1B-induced inflammatory mRNA expression, many inflammatory mRNAs, including CCL4, CCL20, CSF2, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, IL8, PTGS2, and others, showed significant repression. This is consistent with prior observations (23Shah S. King E.M. Chandrasekhar A. Newton R.

BIRC3, CCL2, CCL5, IFNGR1, IL6, LAMB3, MAP3K8, NFKB2, NFKBIZ, and TNFAIP3 mRNAs were induced by IL1B, but not significantly affected by DUSP1 overexpression (Fig. 1A; supplemental Table 1A). However, a number of mRNAs, including APOL6, CFB, CMPK2, CXCL10, HELZ2, ICAM1, IFIT1, IFIT3 isoforms 1 and 2, IRF1, MX1, STAT5A, TLR2, and UBD revealed significantly enhanced IL1B-induced expression in the presence of DUSP1 overexpression (Fig. 1A; supplemental Table 1A). EFNA1, GOS2, and TNF mRNAs were also enhanced by 1.34 ± 1.4, 1.47 ± 0.8, and 2.22 ± 1.7-fold, respectively, by DUSP1 overexpression, but this failed to reach significance (Fig. 1A; supplemental Table 1A). All analyses compare Ad5-DUSP1 to IL1B treatment, and in no case was there any significant effect of the null virus (Ad-null). Supernatants harvested at 18 h showed DUSP1 overexpression to significantly enhance IL1B-induced release of CXCL10 protein (Fig. 1B). The control, Ad-GFP virus, was without effect. After IL1B treatment, IRF1 mRNA was highly induced at 1 h and reached a peak 2 h post-stimulation, before declining toward basal levels (Fig. 1C, upper panel). This kinetic correlated closely with IRF1 protein expression, which also peaked at 2 h and had declined 6 h post-IL1B (Fig. 1C, lower panels). Expression of ICAM1 and STAT5A mRNAs were modestly induced at 1 h, with a peak in expression at 2–6 h before reducing at later times (Fig. 1D, upper panel). This contrasts with effects on APOL6 and the remaining genes, which were lowly induced by IL1B at 1 and 2 h, but showed highest expression at 6 h or, in the case of CFB, at 18 h (Fig. 1D, lower panel). Thus, with the exception of IRF1 and both STAT5A and ICAM1, which showed a marginally delayed induction kinetic relative to IRF1, these IL1B-induced, DUSP1-enhanced mRNAs were “late” genes induced by IL1B. This suggests that expression of these genes requires the earlier expression of another factor and is consistent with prior findings that cycloheximide blocked IL1B-induced mRNA expression of many of these genes (20King E.M. Chivers J.E. Rider C.F. Minnich A. Giembycz M.A. Newton R. Glucocorticoid repression of inflammatory gene expression shows differential responsiveness by transactivation- and transrepression-dependent mechanisms.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e53936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given an “early” kinetic for IRF1, a transcription factor, a role in the induction of these downstream late-phase genes was tested. A549 cells were treated with two IRF1-targeting, or control, siRNAs before treating with IL1B. Cells harvested at 2 h for Western blotting analysis of IRF1 showed that although the LMNA siRNA was without effect, both the IRF1-targeting siRNAs substantially reduced IL1B-induced IRF1 protein expression (Fig. 1E). After harvesting at 6 h, qPCR was performed for the IL1B-induced genes that were significantly enhanced by DUSP1 overexpression plus a number of additional genes that previously showed either no effect or repression after DUSP1 overexpression. With the exception of TLR2, all the late-phase genes (Fig. 1D, lower panel) that previously showed significantly DUSP1-enhanced expression were also IRF1-dependent (Fig. 1F; supplemental Table 1B). Conversely, the early response genes, STAT5A and ICAM1, were not IRF1-dependent. Likewise, those genes that were either unaffected or repressed by DUSP1 overexpression were also not IRF1-dependent. However, silencing of IRF1 produced large and significant 52.08 ± 5.6- and 20.65 ± 8.2-fold enhancements, respectively, in the IL1B-induced expression of CCL5 and CXCL5. This indicates a possible negative role for IRF1 in controlling the expression of these mRNAs (Fig. 1F) (supplemental Table 1B). A549 cells were treated with IL1B in the absence and presence of DUSP1-expressing adenovirus. Western blotting confirmed DUSP1 overexpression (Fig. 2A). Although IRF1 protein was only lowly detectible at 1 h and highly induced at 2 and 4 h, no clear effect of DUSP1 overexpression was apparent at these times. However, whereas IRF1 expression was reduced 6 h post-IL1B, the presence of Ad-DUSP1 maintained IRF1 expression. Likewise, at 10 h DUSP1 overexpression also resulted in enhanced IRF1 expression compared with IL1B-induced IRF1 (data not shown). However, because expression was trending toward basal expression, such effects were only apparent after overexposure of autoradiographic films and are consequently not shown. At 18 h, DUSP1 overexpression had no discernible effect on IRF1 expression (data not shown). In all cases there was no effect of control virus (Fig. 2A). As described above, IL1B induced IRF1 mRNA at 1 h, and this was further increased at 2 h before declining by 6 h (Fig. 2B). In the presence of Ad-DUSP1, but not control virus, there was a 45.9 ± 8.8% reduction in IRF1 mRNA at 1 h. This effect was lost by 2 h, and at 6 h DUSP1 overexpression significantly enhanced (2.6 ± 0.4-fold) IRF1 expression over that obtained with IL1B alone (Fig. 2B). Analysis of RNA from Fig. 1A showed that the enhancement of IRF1 mRNA at 6 h by DUSP1 was associated with significantly increased levels of unspliced nuclear IRF1 RNA (Fig. 2C). As the presence of unspliced nuclear RNA is a surrogate of transcription rate, this suggests that DUSP1 overexpression enhances IRF1 gene transcription. A549 cells were treated with IL1B in the presence or absence of maximally effective concentrations of p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (10 μm), MAPK/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor, U0126 (10 μm) or JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, JNK inhibitor 8 (JNK-IN-8) (10 μm), alone and combined to inhibit all three MAPK pathways simultaneously (Fig. 3A). Maximally effective concentrations (10 μm) of MAPK inhibitors was determined previously by analysis of substrate phosphorylation and functional responses in A549 cells (23Shah S. King E.M. Chandrasekhar A. Newton R. Roles for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase, DUSP1, in feedback control of inflammatory gene expression and repression by dexamethasone.J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As with DUSP1 overexpression, inhibition of each individual MAPK pathway, or all three pathways together, had no effect on IRF1 protein expression induced by IL1B at 2 h. By 4 h post-IL1B treatment, when the IL1B-induced level of IRF1 protein was starting to decline, SB203580, or the three inhibitors combined, resulted in significantly higher levels of IRF1 expression relative to IL1B-treated. At 6 h, IL1B-induced IRF1 expression had further declined, yet this loss was significantly attenuated by SB203580 and the combination inhibitor treatment (Fig. 3A). A549 cells were treated with IL1B for various times in the absence or presence of the inhibitors before analysis of mRNA expression. IRF1 mRNA was rapidly induced by IL1B and reached a peak in expression at 2 h before declining at 4 and 6 h (Fig. 3B, left panel). Compared with this, the MAPK pathway inhibitors alone or in combination had no significant effect on IL1B-induced IRF1 mRNA at 1 or 2 h, although the triple combination produced a modest reduction at 1 h. By 4 h, SB203580 and the combination treatment significantly enhanced IRF1 mRNA expression relative to IL1B-treated, and this effect was more pronounced at 6 h (Fig. 3B, right panel). Analysis of unspliced nuclear IRF1 RNA showed that transcription rate peaked at or before 1 h before declining at subsequent times (Fig. 3C, left panel). Relative to this profile, there was no effect of the MAPK pathway inhibitors at 1 and 2 h, when transcription was high. However, at 4 h, SB203580, UO126, or all three inhibitors together significantly enhanced unspliced nuclear IRF1 RNA levels compared with IL1B-treated. Similar, but reduced effects were observed at 6 h (Fig. 3C, right panel). Taken together, these data revealed little effect of MAPK inhibitors on the induction phase of IRF1 mRNA expression. However, the rapid loss of IRF1 mRNA occurring after the peak at 2 h was attenuated by MAPK inhibition due to a failure to reduce IRF1 transcription at later time points. Analysis of IRF1 mRNA stability using actinomycin D chase methodology showed that after 30 min of IL1B, IRF1 mRNA did not decline over the 45 min of the actinomycin D chase period (Fig. 4A). Rather, immediately post actinomycin D addition, IRF1 mRNA levels continued to increase. We interpret this as showing that although transcription is prevented by actinomycin D, processing of already formed pre-mRNA still occurs and leads to increased accumulation of mature mRNA (32Darnell Jr., J.E. Reflections on the history of pre-mRNA processing and highlights of current knowledge: a unified picture.RNA. 2013; 19: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This effect was not observed at later times (90, 120, or 180 min post IL1B treatment) (Fig. 4A) and is consistent with the considerably reduced transcription rate at these times (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, whereas there was no loss of IRF1 mRNA over the course of the actinomycin D chase after just 30 min of IL1B, a loss to ∼50% of starting levels (t = 0) was observed for all longer (90, 120, and 180 min) IL1B treatment times (Fig. 4A). The effect of the p38 inhibition was examined on IRF1 mRNA stability. Using actinomycin D chase experiments in which just the end point was assayed (i.e. 45 min post-actinomycin D addition), pretreatment with SB203580 produced a repressive effect after the 30-min IL1B treatment (Fig. 4B). However, after 90 min of IL1B treatment there was no effect of SB203580, and at all later times (120, 180 and 240 min) SB203580 modestly enhanced IRF1 mRNA stability (Fig. 4B). To further confirm the effects of SB203580, IRF1 mRNA stability was analyzed after 30 and 180 min of IL1B treatment. Pretreatment with SB203580 followed by IL1B for 30 min resulted in no loss of IRF1 mRNA over the course of the actinomycin D chase, and this was also the case in the absence of SB203580 (Fig. 4C, left panel). However, SB203580 did prevent the continued increase in IRF1 mRNA post-actinomycin D treatment. This suggests a possible role for p38 MAPK in the post-transcriptional processing of pre-RNA to mature IRF1 mRNA. In contrast, the stability of IRF1 mRNA after 180 min of IL1B treatment was modestly, but significantly enhanced by SB203580 over the 45 min of the actinomycin D chase (Fig. 4C, right panel). This suggests that p38 MAPK plays an inhibitory role in regulating IRF1 mRNA stability at longer IL1B treatment times. The effect of DUSP1 overexpression was also examined on IRF1 mRNA stability. Similar to SB203580, IRF1 mRNA stability after 180 min of IL1B treatment was also partially, but significantly, enhanced by DUSP1 overexpression over the course of the actinomycin D chase (Fig. 4D). Control green fluorescent protein (GFP) virus had no effect on IRF1 mRNA stability. Since DUSP1 overexpression inhibits p38 MAPK (23Shah S. King E.M. Chandrasekhar A. Newton R. Roles for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase, DUSP1, in feedback control of inflammatory gene expression and repression by dexamethasone.J. Biol.

The R179H mutation has a poor patient prognosis and is unique in causing multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction (Milewicz, D. M., Østergaard, J. R., Ala-Kokko, L. M., Khan, N., Grange, D.

Here, we characterize this mutation in expressed human SM α-actin. R179H actin shows severe polymerization defects, with a 40-fold higher critical concentration for assembly than WT SM α-actin, driven by a high disassembly rate. The mutant filaments are more readily severed by cofilin. Both defects are attenuated by copolymerization with WT. The R179H monomer binds more tightly to profilin, and formin binding suppresses nucleation and slows polymerization rates. Linear filaments will thus not be readily formed, and cells expressing R179H actin will likely have increased levels of monomeric G-actin. The cotranscription factor myocardin-related transcription factor-A, which affects cellular phenotype, binds R179H actin with less cooperativity than WT actin. Smooth muscle myosin moves R179H filaments more slowly than WT, even when copolymerized with equimolar amounts of WT. The marked decrease in the ability to form filaments may contribute to the poor patient prognosis and explain why R179H disrupts even visceral smooth muscle cell function where the SM α-actin isoform is present in low amounts.

Additionally, importation from endemic countries causes frequent outbreaks in countries where it has been eliminated. The M protein of MeV plays a key role in virus assembly and cytopathogenesis; interestingly, M is localised in nucleus, cytoplasm and membranes of infected cells. We have used transient expression of M in transfected cells and in-cell transcription assays to show that only some MeV M localizes to the nucleus, in addition to cell membranes and the cytoplasm as previously described, and can inhibit cellular transcription via binding to nuclear factors. Additionally, MeV M was able to inhibit in vitro transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, a proportion of M is also localized to nucleus of MeV infected cells at early times in infection, correlating with inhibition of cellular transcription. Our data show, for the first time, that MeV M may play a role early in infection by inhibiting host cell transcription."

Trafficking of NKCC2 to the apical surface regulates NKCC2-mediated NaCl absorption and blood pressure. The molecular mechanisms by which NKCC2 reaches the apical surface and their role in renal function and maintenance of blood pressure are poorly characterized. Here we report that NKCC2 interacts with the vesicle fusion protein VAMP3, and they co-localize at the TAL apical surface. We observed that silencing VAMP3 in vivo blocks constitutive NKCC2 exocytic delivery, decreasing the amount of NKCC2 at the TAL apical surface. VAMP3 is not required for cAMP-stimulated NKCC2 exocytic delivery. Additionally, genetic deletion of VAMP3 in mice decreased total expression of NKCC2 in the TAL and lowered blood pressure. Consistent with these results, urinary excretion of water and electrolytes was higher in VAMP3 knock-out mice, which produced more diluted urine. We conclude that VAMP3 interacts with NKCC2 and mediates its constitutive exocytic delivery to the apical surface. Additionally, VAMP3 is required for normal NKCC2 expression, renal function, and blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2517532308,"TETs (TET1/2/3) play critical roles in multi cellular processes through DNA demethylation driven by oxidation of DNA 5mdC to 5hmdC. Interestingly, recent studies indicated that TETs also oxidate RNA 5mC to 5hmC. However, little is known about the distribution of RNA 5hmC and the regulatory mechanism of RNA 5hmC in human. Here, we show that 5hmC is enriched in mRNA, and IDH1/2 mutants inhibit TET-promoted oxidation of RNA 5mC to 5hmC. Since IDH1/2 mutations have been described to block the DNA oxidative activity of TETs, we hypothesized that IDH1/2 mutations might also inhibit the RNA oxidative activity of TETs. To evaluate the role of IDH1/2 mutations in RNA 5hmC, TETs with/without IDH1/2 mutants were overexpressed in human HEK293 cells. Resultant DNA and RNA were digested and analyzed by triple-quadrupole LC mass spectrometer. DNA 5hmdC and RNA 5hmC modifications were quantified with external calibration curves of appropriate standards. It was found that compared with total RNA (5hmC/C: less than 2 X 10−7), mRNA showed much higher 5hmC level (5hmC/C: ∼7 X 10−6). Further study indicated that IDH1/2 mutants showed significant ability to inhibit TET-promoted RNA5hmC. Consistent with this result, overexpression of IDH1/2 mutants also inhibited TET catalytic domain-promoted oxidation of RNA. In this study, we show not only the enrichment of 5hmC in mRNA, but also a regulatory mechanism of RNA 5hmC—IDH1/2 mutations inhibit TET-promoted RNA 5hmC, which suggests an involvement of IDH1/2 mutations in tumorigenesis through the deregulation of RNA biology."
https://openalex.org/W2508772307,"Mathematical models do not explicitly represent the influence of soil microbial diversity on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics despite recent evidence of relationships between them. The objective of the present study was to statistically investigate relationships between bacterial and fungal diversity indexes (richness, evenness, Shannon index, inverse Simpson index) and decomposition of different pools of soil organic carbon by measuring dynamics of CO2 emissions under controlled conditions. To this end, 20 soils from two different land uses (cropland and grassland) were incubated with or without incorporation of 13C-labelled wheat-straw residue. 13C-labelling allowed us to study residue mineralisation, basal respiration and the priming effect independently. An innovative data-mining approach was applied, based on generalized additive models and a predictive criterion. Results showed that microbial diversity indexes can be good covariates to integrate in SOC dynamics models, depending on the C source and the processes considered (native soil organic carbon vs. fresh wheat residue). Specifically, microbial diversity indexes were good candidates to help explain mineralisation of native soil organic carbon, while priming effect processes seemed to be explained much more by microbial composition, and no microbial diversity indexes were found associated with residue mineralisation. Investigation of relationships between diversity and mineralisation showed that higher diversity, as measured by the microbial diversity indexes, seemed to be related to decreased CO2 emissions in the control soil. We suggest that this relationship can be explained by an increase in carbon yield assimilation as microbial diversity increases. Thus, the parameter for carbon yield assimilation in mathematical models could be calculated as a function of microbial diversity indexes. Nonetheless, given limitations of the methods used, these observations should be considered with caution and confirmed with more experimental studies. Overall, along with other studies on relationships between microbial community composition and SOM dynamics, this study suggests that overall measures of microbial diversity may constitute relevant ways to include microbial diversity in models of SOM dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2511054234,"The proprotein convertase (PC) furin cleaves precursor proteins, an important step in the activation of many cancer-associated proteins. Substrates of furin and furin-like PCs play a role in proliferation, metastasis and invasion. Some of them are involved in the progression of the pediatric soft tissue sarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). In this study, we show that PCs, and in particular furin, are expressed in RMS cell lines. To investigate the functional role of furin, we generated RMS cell lines with modulated furin activity. Silencing or stable inhibition of furin delayed tumor growth in Rh30 and RD xenografts in vivo, and was correlated with lower microvessel density. Reduced furin activity also decreased migration and invasion abilities in vitro, and inhibition of furin in RMS cells diminished processing of IGF1R, VEGF-C, PDGF-B and MT1-MMP, leading to lower levels of mature proteins. Furthermore, we found that furin activity is required for proper IGF signaling in RMS cells, as furin silencing resulted in reduced phosphorylation of Akt upon IGF1 stimulation. Taken together, our results suggest that furin plays an important role in the malignant phenotype of RMS cells by activating proteins involved in tumor growth and vascularization, metastasis and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2514024574,"Background The aim of the study was to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of provided and received support on older adults’ subjective well-being (positive affect and depression) and to examine whether being a recipient of institutional care moderates these effects. Methods Social support (provided and received), positive affect, and depressive symptoms were assessed twice (at baseline and 1 month later) for 277 older adults (age 77.39 ± 9.20 years, 67.50% women, 65% residents of an institutional care facility). Findings Two structural equation models were analyzed: cross-sectional (at baseline) and longitudinal (after 1 month). The first model revealed a significant positive relationship between providing and receiving support and positive affect, and a negative relationship between receiving support and depression. However, being a recipient of institutional care appeared to be a significant moderator in the longitudinal model. Specifically, the findings indicated effects of both providing and receiving support on positive affect but only for noninstitutionalized older adults. Discussion Although both types of support may be beneficial for older adults, their effects depend on the nature of social exchange and the dimensions of well-being. This suggests that such factors should be systematically investigated in future research."

The A. spiniferus mitogenome contains 36 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 21 transfer RNAs (tRNA), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) and a large non-coding region (control region, CR). Like most whiteflies, the A. spiniferus mitogenome had a large degree of rearrangement due to translocation of the nad3-trnG-cox3 gene cluster. The 13 PCGs initiated with ATN and generally terminated with TAA, although some used TAG or T as stop codons; atp6 showed the highest evolutionary rate, whereas cox2 appeared to have the lowest rate. The A. spiniferus mitogenome had 21 tRNAs with a typical cloverleaf secondary structure composed of four arms. Modeling of the two rRNA genes indicated that their secondary structure was similar to that of other insects. The CR of A. spiniferus was 920 bp and mapped between the nad3-trnG-cox3 and trnI-trnM gene clusters. One potential stem-loop structure and five tandem repeats were identified in the CR. Phylogenetic relationships of 11 species from the Aleyrodidae were analyzed based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the 13 PCGs and evolutionary characteristics were explored. Species with more genetic rearrangements were generally more evolved within the Aleyrodidae."
https://openalex.org/W2514161591,"Background and Objectives Despite the widespread acknowledgement of the importance of childhood oral health, little progress has been made in preventing early childhood caries. Limited information exists regarding specific daily-life and community-related factors that impede optimal oral hygiene, diet, care, and ultimately oral health for children. We sought to understand what parents of young children consider important and potentially modifiable factors and resources influencing their children’s oral health, within the contexts of the family and the community. Methods This qualitative study employed Photovoice among 10 English-speaking parents of infants and toddlers who were clients of an urban WIC clinic in North Carolina. The primary research question was: “What do you consider as important behaviors, as well as family and community resources to prevent cavities among young children?” Five group sessions were conducted and they were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative research methodology. Inductive analyses were based on analytical summaries, double-coding, and summary matrices and were done using Atlas.ti.7.5.9 software. Findings Good oral health was associated with avoidance of problems or restorations for the participants. Financial constraints affected healthy food and beverage choices, as well as access to oral health care. Time constraints and occasional frustration related to children’s oral hygiene emerged as additional barriers. Establishment of rules/routines and commitment to them was a successful strategy to promote their children’s oral health, as well as modeling of older siblings, cooperation among caregivers and peer support. Community programs and organizations, social hubs including playgrounds, grocery stores and social media emerged as promising avenues for gaining support and sharing resources. Conclusions Low-income parents of young children are faced with daily life struggles that interfere with oral health and care. Financial constraints are pervasive, but parents identified several strategies involving home care and community agents that can be helpful. Future interventions aimed to improve children’s oral health must take into consideration the role of families and the communities in which they live."
https://openalex.org/W2513221636,"Chlamydiae sp. are obligate intracellular pathogens that cause a variety of diseases in humans. The adhesion of Chlamydiae to the eukaryotic host cell is a pivotal step in pathogenesis. The adhesin family of polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmp) in Chlamydia pneumoniae consists of 21 members. Pmp21 binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Pmps contain large numbers of FXXN (where X is any amino acid) and GGA(I/L/V) motifs. At least two of these motifs are crucial for adhesion by certain Pmp21 fragments. Here we describe how the two FXXN motifs in Pmp21-D (D-Wt), a domain of Pmp21, influence its self-interaction, folding, and adhesive capacities. Refolded D-Wt molecules form oligomers with high sedimentation values (8-85 S). These oligomers take the form of elongated protofibrils, which exhibit Thioflavin T fluorescence, like the amyloid protein fragment β42. A mutant version of Pmp21-D (D-Mt), with FXXN motifs replaced by SXXV, shows a markedly reduced capacity to form oligomers. Secondary-structure assays revealed that monomers of both variants exist predominantly as random coils, whereas the oligomers form predominantly β-sheets. Adhesion studies revealed that oligomers of D-Wt (D-Wt-O) mediate significantly enhanced binding to human epithelial cells relative to D-Mt-O and monomeric protein species. Moreover, D-Wt-O binds EGFR more efficiently than D-Wt monomers. Importantly, pretreatment of human cells with D-Wt-O reduces infectivity upon subsequent challenge with C. pneumoniae more effectively than all other protein species. Hence, the FXXN motif in D-Wt induces the formation of β-sheet-rich oligomeric protofibrils, which are important for adhesion to, and subsequent infection of human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2516081867,"The propagation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly dependent on host cellular factors. To identify the cellular factors involved in HCV propagation, we have previously performed protein microarray assays using the HCV nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein as a probe. Of ∼9,000 host proteins immobilized in a microarray, ∼90 cellular proteins were identified as HCV NS5A interacting partners. Of these candidates, we selected Abelson interactor 1 (Abi1) for further characterization. Binding of HCV NS5A to Abi1 was verified by both in vitro pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays. HCV NS5A interacted with Abi1 through regions I + II of Abi1 and domain I of NS5A. We further demonstrated that Abi1 colocalized with the HCV NS5A protein in the cytoplasm. We showed that NS5A inhibited epidermal growth factor-mediated ERK and Egr1 activations and this inhibitory activity of NS5A was nullified in Abi1-knockdown cells. Moreover, silencing of Abi1 expression impaired HCV replication, whereas overexpression of Abi1 promoted HCV propagation. Collectively, these data indicate that HCV exploits host Abi1 protein via NS5A to modulate MEK/ERK signaling pathway for its own propagation."

Diclofenac was conjugated to a novel phenylalanyl-N-methyl-naphthalenylalanine-derived diketopiperazine (DKP) shuttle and to TAT (a classical cell penetrating peptide), and topically applied to human epidermis in vitro. DKP and TAT effectively permeated into and through human epidermis. When conjugated to diclofenac, both DKP and TAT enhanced delivery into and through human epidermis, though DKP was significantly more effective. Penetration of diclofenac through human epidermis (to receptor) was increased by conjugation to the peptide shuttle and cell penetrating peptide with enhancement of 6x by DKP-diclofenac and 3x by TAT-diclofenac. In addition, the amount of diclofenac retained within the epidermis was significantly increased by peptide conjugation. COX-2 inhibition activity of diclofenac was retained when conjugated to DKP. Our study suggests that the peptide shuttle approach may offer a new strategy for targeted delivery of small therapeutic and diagnostic molecules to the skin."
https://openalex.org/W2513621976,"Evolution of host defenses such as immune function requires heritable genetic variation in them. However, also non-genetic maternal effects can contribute to phenotypic variation, thus being an alternative target for natural selection. We investigated the role of individuals' genetic background and maternal effects in determining immune defense traits (phenoloxidase and antibacterial activity of hemolymph), as well as in survival and growth, in the simultaneously hermaphroditic snail Lymnaea stagnalis. We utilized the mixed mating system of this species by producing full-sib families in which each parental snail had produced offspring as both a dam and as a sire, and tested whether genetic background (family) and non-genetic maternal effects (dam nested within family) explain trait variation. Immune defense traits and growth were affected solely by individuals' genetic background. Survival of snails did not show family-level variation. Additionally, some snails were produced through self-fertilization. They showed reduced growth and survival suggesting recessive load or overdominance. Immune defense traits did not respond to inbreeding. Our results suggest that the variation in snail immune function and growth was due to genetic differences. Since immune traits did not respond to inbreeding, this variation is most likely due to additive or epistatic genetic variance."
https://openalex.org/W2514949198,"The transcriptional co-activator Yki (Yorkie), a member of the Hippo pathway, regulates cell proliferation or apoptosis, depending on its nuclear or cytoplasmic location. However, the upstream factors regulating the subcellular localization of Yki are unclear. We found that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) induces phosphorylation of Yki, causing it to remain in the cytoplasm, where it promotes apoptosis in the midgut of the lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera. Yki is expressed in various tissues, with an increase in the epidermis and midgut during early metamorphic molting. Yki is localized mainly in the nucleus of feeding larval midgut cells but is mainly localized in the cytoplasm of metamorphic molting larval midgut cells. The knockdown of Yki in the feeding larvae promotes larval-pupal transition, midgut programmed cell death, and repressed IAP1 (inhibitor of apoptosis 1) expression. Knockdown of Yki in the epidermal cell line (HaEpi) induced increased activation of Caspase3/7. Overexpressed Yki in HaEpi cells was mainly localized in the nucleus and induced cell proliferation. 20E promotes the cytoplasmic localization of Yki, reducing the expression of the IAP1, resulting in apoptosis. 20E promotes cytoplasmic retention of Yki by increasing Yki phosphorylation levels and promoting the interaction between Yki and the adaptor protein 14-3-3-ϵ. This regulation of Yki suppresses cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2509011181,"The accessory Sec system in Streptococcus gordonii DL1 is a specialized export system that transports a large serine-rich repeat protein, Hsa, to the bacterial surface. The system is composed of core proteins SecA2 and SecY2 and accessory Sec proteins Asp1–Asp5. Similar to canonical SecYEG, SecY2 forms a channel for translocation of the Hsa adhesin across the cytoplasmic membrane. Accessory Sec proteins Asp4 and Asp5 have been suggested to work alongside SecY2 to form the translocon, similar to the associated SecY, SecE, and SecG of the canonical system (SecYEG). To test this theory, S. gordonii secY2, asp4, and asp5 were co-expressed in Escherichia coli. The resultant complex was subsequently purified, and its composition was confirmed by mass spectrometry to be SecY2-Asp4-Asp5. Like SecYEG, the non-canonical complex activates the ATPase activity of the SecA motor (SecA2). This study also shows that Asp4 and Asp5 are necessary for optimal adhesion of S. gordonii to glycoproteins gp340 and fibronectin, known Hsa binding partners, as well as for early stage biofilm formation. This work opens new avenues for understanding the structure and function of the accessory Sec system.

https://openalex.org/W2518591362,"Ability to predict and prevent incipient functional decline in older adults may help prolong independence. Cognition is related to everyday function and easily administered, sensitive cognitive tests may help identify at-risk individuals. Factors like depressive symptoms and self-rated health are also associated with functional ability and may be as important as cognition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between concurrent longitudinal changes in cognition, depression, self-rated health and everyday function in a well-defined cohort of healthy 85 year olds that were followed-up at the age of 90 in the Elderly in Linköping Screening Assessment 85 study. Regression analyses were used to determine if cognitive decline as assessed by global (the Mini-Mental State Examination) and domain specific (the Cognitive Assessment Battery, CAB) cognitive tests predicted functional decline in the context of changes in depressive symptoms and self-rated health. Results showed deterioration in most variables and as many as 83% of these community-dwelling elders experienced functional difficulties at the age of 90. Slowing-down of processing speed as assessed by the Symbol Digits Modality Test (included in the CAB) accounted for 14% of the variance in functional decline. Worsening self-rated health accounted for an additional 6%, but no other variables reached significance. These results are discussed with an eye to possible preventive interventions that may prolong independence for the steadily growing number of normally aging old-old citizens."
https://openalex.org/W2512635923,"Access to healthcare is an important public health concept and has been traditionally measured by using population level parameters, such as availability, distribution and proximity of the health facilities in relation to the population. However, client based factors such as their expectations, experiences and perceptions which impact their evaluations of health care access were not well studied and integrated into health policy frameworks and implementation programs.This study aimed to investigate factors associated with perceived access to HIV/AIDS Treatment and care services in Wolaita Zone, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 492 people living with HIV, with 411 using ART and 81 using pre-ART services accessed at six public sector health facilities from November 2014 to March 2015. Data were analyzed using the ologit function of STATA. The variables explored consisted of socio-demographic and health characteristics, type of health facility, type of care, distance, waiting time, healthcare responsiveness, transportation convenience, satisfaction with service, quality of care, financial fairness, out of pocket expenses and HIV disclosure.Of the 492 participants, 294 (59.8%) were females and 198 (40.2%) were males, with a mean age of 38.8 years. 23.0% and 12.2% believed they had 'good' or 'very good' access respectively, and 64.8% indicated lower ratings. In the multivariate analysis, distance from the health facility, type of care, HIV clinical stage, out of pocket expenses, employment status, type of care, HIV disclosure and perceived transportation score were not associated with the perceived access (PA). With a unit increment in satisfaction, perceived quality of care, health system responsiveness, transportation convenience and perceived financial fairness scores, the odds of providing higher rating of PA increased by 29.0% (p<0.001), 6.0%(p<0.01), 100.0% (p<0.001), 9.0% (p<0.05) and 6.0% (p<0.05) respectively.Perceived quality of care, health system responsiveness, perceived financial fairness, transportation convenience and satisfaction with services were correlates of perceived access and affected healthcare performance. Interventions targeted at improving access to HIV/AIDS treatment and care services should address these factors. Further studies may be needed to confirm the findings."
https://openalex.org/W2508439223,"Secure aggregation is an essential component of modern distributed applications and data mining platforms. Aggregated statistical results are typically adopted in constructing a data cube for data analysis at multiple abstraction levels in data warehouse platforms. Generating different types of statistical results efficiently at the same time (or referred to as enabling multi-functional support) is a fundamental requirement in practice. However, most of the existing schemes support a very limited number of statistics. Securely obtaining typical statistical results simultaneously in the distribution system, without recovering the original data, is still an open problem. In this paper, we present SEDAR, which is a SEcure Data Aggregation scheme under the Range segmentation model. Range segmentation model is proposed to reduce the communication cost by capturing the data characteristics, and different range uses different aggregation strategy. For raw data in the dominant range, SEDAR encodes them into well defined vectors to provide value-preservation and order-preservation, and thus provides the basis for multi-functional aggregation. A homomorphic encryption scheme is used to achieve data privacy. We also present two enhanced versions. The first one is a Random based SEDAR (REDAR), and the second is a Compression based SEDAR (CEDAR). Both of them can significantly reduce communication cost with the trade-off lower security and lower accuracy, respectively. Experimental evaluations, based on six different scenes of real data, show that all of them have an excellent performance on cost and accuracy."
