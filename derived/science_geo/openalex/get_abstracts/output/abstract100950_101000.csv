https://openalex.org/W1982062664,"NF-kappa B, which consists of two polypeptides, p50 (M(r) 50K) and p65/RelA (M(r) 65K), is thought to be a key regulator of genes involved in responses to infection, inflammation and stress. Indeed, although developmentally normal, mice deficient in p50 display functional defects in immune responses. Here we describe the generation of mice deficient in the RelA subunit of NF-kappa B. Disruption of the relA locus leads to embryonic lethality at 15-16 days of gestation, concomitant with a massive degeneration of the liver by programmed cell death or apoptosis. Embryonic fibroblasts from RelA-deficient mice are defective in the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated induction of messenger RNAs for I kappa B alpha and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), although basal levels of these transcripts are unaltered. These results indicate that RelA controls inducible, but not basal, transcription in NF-kappa B-regulated pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2022367303,"Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause a subset of cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Four lines of mice accumulating one of these mutant proteins (G37R) develop severe, progressive motor neuron disease. At lower levels of mutant accumulation, pathology is restricted to lower motor neurons, whereas higher levels cause more severe abnormalities and affect a variety of other neuronal populations. The most obvious cellular abnormality is the presence in axons and dendrites of membrane-bounded vacuoles, which appear to be derived from degenerating mitochondria. Since multiple lines of mice expressing wild-type human SOD1 at similar and higher levels do not show disease, the disease in mice expressing the G37R mutant SOD1 must arise from the acquisition of an adverse property by the mutant enzyme, rather than elevation or loss of SOD1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1978046264,"A Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain (UCBPP-PA14) is infectious both in an Arabidopsis thaliana leaf infiltration model and in a mouse full-thickness skin burn model. UCBPP-PA14 exhibits ecotype specificity for Arabidopsis, causing a range of symptoms from none to severe in four different ecotypes. In the mouse model, UCBPP-PA14 is as lethal as other well-studied P. aeruginosa strains. Mutations in the UCBPP-PA14 toxA, plcS, and gacA genes resulted in a significant reduction in pathogenicity in both hosts, indicating that these genes encode virulence factors required for the full expression of pathogenicity in both plants and animals."
https://openalex.org/W2021438486,"In contrast to other members of the Eag family of voltage-gated, outwardly rectifying potassium channels, the human eag-related gene (HERG) has now been shown to encode an inwardly rectifying potassium channel. The properties of HERG channels are consistent with the gating properties of Eag-related and other outwardly rectifying, S4-containing potassium channels, but with the addition of an inactivation mechanism that attenuates potassium efflux during depolarization. Because mutations in HERG cause a form of long-QT syndrome, these properties of HERG channel function may be critical to the maintenance of normal cardiac rhythmicity."
https://openalex.org/W2049700891,"The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum evades host immunity by varying the antigenic and adhesive character of infected erythrocytes. We describe a large and extremely diverse family of P. falciparum genes (var) that encode 200-350 kDa proteins having the expected properties of antigenically variant adhesion molecules. Predicted amino acid sequences of var genes show a variable extracellular segment with domains having receptor-binding features, a transmembrane sequence, and a terminal segment that is a probable submembrane anchor. There are 50-150 var genes on multiple parasite chromosomes, and some are in clustered arrangements. var probes detect two classes of transcripts in steady-state RNA: 7-9 kb var transcripts, and an unusual family of 1.8-2.4 kb transcripts that may be involved in expression or rearrangements of var genes."
https://openalex.org/W2170104643,"Sex differences in central tendency, variability, and numbers of high scores on mental tests have been extensively studied. Research has not always seemed to yield consistent results, partly because most studies have not used representative samples of national populations. An analysis of mental test scores from six studies that used national probability samples provided evidence that although average sex differences have been generally small and stable over time, the test scores of males consistently have larger variance. Except in tests of reading comprehension, perceptual speed, and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2052523483,"Plasmodium falciparum expresses on the host erythrocyte surface clonally variant antigens and ligands that mediate adherence to endothelial receptors. Both are central to pathogenesis, since they allow chronicity of infection and lead to concentration of infected erythrocytes in cerebral vessels. Here we show that expression of variant antigenic determinants is correlated with expression of individual members of a large, multigene family named var. Each var gene contains copies of a motif that has been previously shown to bind diverse host receptors; expression of a specific var gene correlated with binding to ICAM-1. Thus, our findings are consistent with the involvement of var genes in antigenic variation and binding to endothelium."

https://openalex.org/W2095352046,"Human leukocyte antigen DM (HLA-DM) molecules are structurally related to classical MHC class II molecules and reside in the lysosome-like compartment where class II-restricted antigen processing is thought to occur. Mutant cell lines lacking HLA-DM are defective in antigen processing and accumulate class II molecules associated with a nested set of invariant chain-derived peptides (class II-associated invariant chain peptides, CLIP). Here we show that HLA-DM catalyzes the dissociation of CLIP from MHC class II-CLIP complexes in vitro and facilitates the binding of antigenic peptides. The reaction has an acidic pH optimum, consistent with its occurrence in a lysosome-like compartment in vivo. Antibody blocking experiments suggest that a transient interaction between HLA-DM and the MHC class II-CLIP complex is required."
https://openalex.org/W2012569825,"The crumbs protein of Drosophila is an integral membrane protein, with 30 EGF-like and 4 laminin A G domain-like repeats in its extracellular segment, which is expressed on the apical plasma membrane of all ectodermally derived epithelia. Here, we present evidence to show that the insertion of crumbs into the plasma membrane is necessary and sufficient to confer apical character on a membrane domain. Overexpression of crumbs results in an enormous expansion of the apical plasma membrane and the concomitant reduction of the basolateral domain. This is followed by the redistribution of beta Heavy-spectrin, a component of the membrane cytoskeleton, and by the ectopic deposition of cuticle and other apical components into these areas. Strikingly, overexpression of the membrane-bound cytoplasmic portion of crumbs alone is sufficient to produce this dominant phenotype. Our results suggest that crumbs plays a key role in specifying the apical plasma membrane domain of ectodermal epithelial cells of Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2064700784,"A mismatch-binding heterodimer of hMSH2 and a 160-kilodalton polypeptide has been isolated from HeLa cells by virtue of its ability to restore mismatch repair to nuclear extracts of hMSH2-deficient LoVo colorectal tumor cells. This heterodimer, designated hMutSα, also restores mismatch repair to extracts of alkylation-tolerant MT1 lymphoblastoid cells and HCT-15 colorectal tumor cells, which are selectively defective in the repair of base-base and single-nucleotide insertion-deletion mismatches. Because HCT-15 cells appear to be free of hMSH2 mutations, this selective repair defect is likely a result of a deficiency of the hMutSα 160-kilodalton subunit, and mutations in the corresponding gene may confer hypermutability and cancer predisposition."
https://openalex.org/W2097765112,"Human T cell lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis (also termed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy). HTLV-I-infected peripheral blood T cells exhibit an initial phase of interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent growth; over time, by an unknown mechanism, the cells become IL-2-independent. Whereas the Jak kinases Jak1 and Jak3 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins Stat3 and Stat5 are activated in normal T cells in response to IL-2, this signaling pathway was constitutively activated in HTLV-I-transformed cells. In HTLV-I-infected cord blood lymphocytes, the transition from IL-2-dependent to IL-2-independent growth correlated with the acquisition of a constitutively activated Jak-STAT pathway, which suggests that this pathway participates in HTLV-I-mediated T cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2021186319,"We generated mice with a null mutation of the forebrain-restricted transcription factor BF-1 to examine its function in brain development. Heterozygous animals have an apparently normal phenotype. Homozygous null BF-1 mutants die at birth and have a dramatic reduction in the size of the cerebral hemispheres. The development of the ventral telencephalon is more severely affected than that of the dorsal telencephalon. Telencephalic neuroepithelial cells are specified in the BF-1 mutant, but their proliferation is reduced. Dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelial cells also differentiate prematurely, leading to early depletion of the progenitor population. These results suggest that BF-1 controls the morphogenesis of the telencephalon by regulating the rate of neuroepithelial cell proliferation and the timing of neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2012867725,"DNA mismatch recognition and binding in human cells has been thought to be mediated by the hMSH2 protein. Here it is shown that the mismatch-binding factor consists of two distinct proteins, the 100-kilodalton hMSH2 and a 160-kilodalton polypeptide, GTBP (for G/T binding protein). Sequence analysis identified GTBP as a new member of the MutS homolog family. Both proteins are required for mismatch-specific binding, a result consistent with the finding that tumor-derived cell lines devoid of either protein are also devoid of mismatch-binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W2051248004,"Photolyase repairs ultraviolet (UV) damage to DNA by splitting the cyclobutane ring of the major UV photoproduct, the cis, syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (Pyr <> Pyr). The reaction is initiated by blue light and proceeds through long-range energy transfer, single electron transfer, and enzyme catalysis by a radical mechanism. The three-dimensional crystallographic structure of DNA photolyase from Escherichia coli is presented and the atomic model was refined to an R value of 0.172 at 2.3 A resolution. The polypeptide chain of 471 amino acids is folded into an amino-terminal alpha/beta domain resembling dinucleotide binding domains and a carboxyl-terminal helical domain; a loop of 72 residues connects the domains. The light-harvesting cofactor 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate (MTHF) binds in a cleft between the two domains. Energy transfer from MTHF to the catalytic cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) occurs over a distance of 16.8 A. The FAD adopts a U-shaped conformation between two helix clusters in the center of the helical domain and is accessible through a hole in the surface of this domain. Dimensions and polarity of the hole match those of a Pyr <> Pyr dinucleotide, suggesting that the Pyr <> Pyr ""flips out"" of the helix to fit into this hole, and that electron transfer between the flavin and the Pyr <> Pyr occurs over van der Waals contact distance."

https://openalex.org/W1983811214,"The molecular defects responsible for tumor cell hypermutability in humans have not yet been fully identified. Here the gene encoding a G/T mismatch-binding protein (GTBP) was localized to within 1 megabase of the related hMSH2 gene on chromosome 2 and was found to be inactivated in three hypermutable cell lines. Unlike cells defective in other mismatch repair genes, which display widespread alterations in mononucleotide, dinucleotide, and other simple repeated sequences, the GTBP-deficient cells showed alterations primarily in mononucleotide tracts. These results suggest that GTBP is important for maintaining the integrity of the human genome and document molecular defects accounting for variation in mutator phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2013558874,"The physiological role of BDNF and NT-3 in the development of the vestibular and auditory systems was investigated in mice that carry a deleted BDNF and/or NT-3 gene. BDNF was the major survival factor for vestibular ganglion neurons, and NT-3, for spiral ganglion neurons. Lack of BDNF and NT-3 did not affect ingrowth of nerve fibers into the vestibular epithelium, but BDNF mutants failed to maintain afferent and efferent innervation. In the cochlea, BDNF mutants lost type 2 spiral neurons, causing an absence of outer hair cell innervation. NT-3 mutants showed a paucity of afferents and lost 87% of spiral neurons, presumably corresponding to type 1 neurons, which innervate inner hair cells. Double mutants had an additive loss, lacking all vestibular and spiral neurons. These results show that BDNF and NT-3 are crucial for inner ear development and, although largely coexpressed, have distinct and nonoverlapping roles in the vestibular and auditory systems."
https://openalex.org/W2122986506,"The origins of arthropods and the phylogenetic relationships among their three major living groups (atelocerates, crustaceans and chelicerates) are vigorously contended. To help resolve this, we determined mitochondrial gene arrangements for a chelicerate, a myriapod, two crustaceans, an onychophoran, a mollusc and an annelid, and compared them with published gene orders of other species. The result strongly supports the monophyly of Arthropoda and of Mandibulata (atelocerates plus crustaceans) and refutes the Uniramia (atelocerates plus onychophorans). Gene arrangement comparisons are emerging as a powerful new tool for resolving ancient phylogenetic relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2130937302,"Lipomas are one of the most common mesenchymal neoplasms in humans. They are characterized by consistent cytogenetic aberrations involving chromosome 12 in bands q14-15. Interestingly, this region is also the site of rearrangement for other mesenchymally derived tumors. This study demonstrates that HMGI-C, an architectural factor that functions in transcriptional regulation, has been disrupted by rearrangement at the 12q14-15 chromosomal breakpoint in lipomas. Chimeric transcripts were isolated from two lipomas in which HMGI-C DNA-binding domains (AT hook motifs) are fused to either a LIM or an acidic transactivation domain. These results, identifying a gene rearranged in a benign neoplastic process that does not proceed to a malignancy, suggest a role for HMGI-C in adipogenesis and mesenchyme differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1997974036,"Many organisms expand the information content of their genome through enzymatic methylation of cytosine residues. Here we report the 2.8 A crystal structure of a bacterial DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DCMtase), M. HaeIII, bound covalently to DNA. In this complex, the substrate cytosine is extruded from the DNA helix and inserted into the active site of the enzyme, as has been observed for another DCMtase, M. HhaI. The DNA is bound in a cleft between the two domains of the protein and is distorted from the characteristic B-form conformation at its recognition sequence. A comparison of structures shows a variation in the mode of DNA recognition: M. HaeIII differs from M. HhaI in that the remaining bases in its recognition sequence undergo an extensive rearrangement in their pairing. In this process, the bases are unstacked, and a gap 8 A long opens in the DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2093768785,"The S4 segment comprises part of the voltage sensor in Shaker K+ channels. We have used a strategy similar to intragenic suppression, but without a genetic selection, to identify electrostatic interactions of the S4 segment that may be important in the mechanism of voltage-dependent activation. The S4 neutralization mutations K374Q and R377Q block maturation of the protein, suggesting that they prevent proper folding. K374Q is specifically and efficiently rescued by the second site mutations E293Q and D316N, located in putative transmembrane segments S2 and S3, respectively. These results suggest that K374, E293, and D316 form a network of strong, local, electrostatic interactions that stabilize the structure of the channel. Some other double mutant combinations result in inefficient suppression, identifying weak, presumably long-range electrostatic interactions. A simple structural hypothesis is proposed to account for the effects of the rescued double mutant combinations on the relative stabilities of open and closed channel conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2123259277,"Various diverse extracellular proteins possess Ca(2+)-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, the function of which remains uncertain. We have determined, at high resolution (1.5 A), the crystal structure of such a domain, from human clotting factor IX, as a complex with Ca2+. The Ca2+ ligands form a classic pentagonal bipyramid with six ligands contributed by one polypeptide chain and the seventh supplied by a neighboring EGF-like domain. The crystal structure identifies the role of Ca2+ in maintaining the conformation of the N-terminal region of the domain, but more importantly demonstrates that Ca2+ can directly mediate protein-protein contacts. The observed crystal packing of the domains provides a plausible model for the association of multiple tandemly linked EGF-like domains in proteins such as fibrillin-1, Notch, and protein S. This model is consistent with the known functional data and suggests a general biological role for these domains."
https://openalex.org/W2031984950,"A functional screen for gene products that rescue dorsal development in ventralized Xenopus embryos has yielded Xenopus nodal-related 3 (Xnr3), a diverged member of the TGF beta superfamily. Xnr3 is specifically expressed in the Spemann organizer and is only expressed in the epithelial layer of the organizer immediately preceding and extending through gastrulation. Like noggin, Xnr3 can induce muscle in ventral mesoderm explants, consistent with a role in patterning the gastrula. In other ways, the activity of Xnr3 is different from noggin. Embryos receiving injections of Xnr3, particularly in the animal pole, send out tube-like extensions of tissue from the site of injection. These protrusions usually contain no axial mesoderm and only occasionally are positive for neural markers. It has previously been proposed that the epithelial layer of the organizer initiates and coordinates the morphogenetic movements at gastrulation. The protrusions observed may reflect an activity of Xnr3 in promoting morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2089475202,"Peptide synthetases involved in the nonribosomal synthesis of peptide secondary metabolites possess a highly conserved domain structure. The arrangement of these domains within the multifunctional enzymes determines the number and order of the amino acid constituents of the peptide product. A general approach has been developed for targeted substitution of amino acid-activating domains within the srfA operon, which encodes the protein templates for the synthesis of the lipopeptide antibiotic surfactin in Bacillus subtilis. Exchange of domain-coding regions of bacterial and fungal origin led to the construction of hybrid genes that encoded peptide synthetases with altered amino acid specificities and the production of peptides with modified amino acid sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2033097911,"We have (separately) disrupted all of the expressed macronuclear copies of the HHO gene encoding macronuclear histone H1 and of the micronuclear linker histone (MLH) gene encoding the protein MicLH in Tetrahymena thermophila. These disruptions are shown to eliminate completely the expression of each protein. Strains without either linker histone grow at normal rates and reach near-normal cell densities, demonstrating that linker histones are not essential for cell survival. Histone H1 knockout (delta H1) cells have enlarged DAPI-stained macronuclei and normal-sized micronuclei, while MicLH knockout (delta MicLH) cells have enlarged micronuclei and normal-sized macronuclei. delta MicLH cells undergo mitosis normally. However, the micronuclear mitotic chromosome structure is less condensed. These studies provide evidence that linker histones are nonessential and are involved in chromatin packaging and condensation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1974022382,"The rapamycin-sensitive signaling pathway is required to transduce specific mitogenic signals to the cell cycle machinery responsible for G1 progression. Genetic studies in yeast identified two related genes on this pathway, TOR1 and TOR2, thought to encode novel phosphatidylinositol kinases. We now show that an intact kinase domain is required for the G1 cell cycle functions of both proteins, for the ability of a mutation in a neighboring FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain of the TOR1 protein to inhibit the growth of yeast cells when overexpressed, and for the essential function of the TOR2 protein. The G1 function of both TOR proteins is sensitive to rapamycin, but the essential function of TOR2 is not. Thus, FKBP12-rapamycin does not appear to inhibit the kinase activity of TOR proteins in a general way; instead, it may interfere selectively with TOR protein binding to or phosphorylation of G1 effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1991020048,"In the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, proton transfer from the retinal Schiff base to aspartate-85 is the crucial reaction of the transport cycle. In halorhodopsin, a light-driven chloride ion pump, the equivalent of residue 85 is threonine. When aspartate-85 was replaced with threonine, the mutated bacteriorhodopsin became a chloride ion pump when expressed in Halobacterium salinarium and, like halorhodopsin, actively transported chloride ions in the direction opposite from the proton pump. Chloride was bound to it, as revealed by large shifts of the absorption maximum of the chromophore, and its photointermediates included a red-shifted state in the millisecond time domain, with its amplitude and decay rate dependent on chloride concentration. Bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin thus share a common transport mechanism, and the interaction of residue 85 with the retinal Schiff base determines the ionic specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2031688286,"Central neurons are subject to a tonic barrage of randomly occurring spontaneous inhibitory events (mIP-SCs) resulting from the action potential-independent release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Do the terminals making synapses onto somatic versus dendritic sites, which arise from specific populations of interneurons, differ in their ability to generate mIPSCs? We have combined the techniques of whole-cell patch-clamp recording and computational simulation to demonstrate that in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, most of the action potential-independent inhibition taking place as mIPSCs originates from proximal sites. Indeed, removal of the bulk (> 50%) of the dendritic tree did not change the characteristics of mIPSCs. These results are consistent with a functional segregation of GABAergic terminals synapsing at proximal versus distal portions of central neurons. Thus, proximal GABAergic terminals are responsible for tonic inhibition targeted at the soma."
https://openalex.org/W2070373577,"The ability to evaluate traveled distance is common to most animal species. Head trajectory in space is measured on the basis of the converging signals of the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems, together with efferent copies of motor commands. Recent evidence from human studies has shown that head trajectory in space can be stored in spatial memory. A fundamental question, however, remains unanswered: How is movement stored? In this study, humans who were asked to reproduce passive linear whole-body displacement distances while blindfolded were also able to reproduce velocity profiles. This finding suggests that a spatiotemporal dynamic pattern of motion is stored and can be retrieved with the use of vestibular and somesthetic cues."
https://openalex.org/W2030383157,"The Raf-1 protein kinase participates in transduction of mitogenic signals, but its mechanisms of activation are incompletely understood. Treatment of human Raf-1 purified from insect Sf9 cells co-expressing c-H-Ras and Src(Y527F) (in which phenylalanine replaces tyrosine at residue 527) with either serine-threonine or tyrosine phosphatases resulted in enzymatic inactivation of Raf-1. Inactivation of purified Raf-1 was blocked by addition of either the 14-3-3 zeta protein or heat shock protein 90. Loading of plasma membranes from transformed cells with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) resulted in inactivation of endogenous or exogenous Raf-1; inactivation was blocked by inclusion of protein phosphatase inhibitors. These results suggest the existence of protein phosphatases in the cell membrane that are regulated by GTP and are responsible for Raf-1 inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1985358683,"Cell lineage studies of the rat cerebral cortex suggest that by midneurogenesis, most precursor cells of the ventricular zone are specified to produce a single cell type. Yet there is also evidence for multipotential precursor cells. We used a retroviral vector to follow the developmental potential of cortical precursor cells by labeling cortical cells in cultures from embryos between 12 and 18 days of gestation. We found specified precursor cells as early as embryonic day 12, in addition to bipotential cells that generate neurons and astrocytes. Most importantly, we discovered a type of neural precursor cell, a neuroepithelial cell, that predominates earlier in development, differs distinctly from the specified precursor cells, and as a population, appears to be multipotential. These data suggest that corticogenesis progresses from an early phase dominated by neuroepithelial cells to a later phase characterized by multiple populations of specified precursor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2017836075,"The magnitude and dynamics of [Ca2+] changes in spines and dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons have been characterized using a low affinity fluorescent indicator, mag-Fura 5, that is sensitive to Ca2+ in the micromolar range. During tetanic stimulation (1 s), we observed progressive [Ca2+] increases in distal CA1 spines to as much as 20-40 microM, both in organotypic slice culture and acute slice. Similar accumulations were reached during continuous depolarization (+10 mV, 1 s) when K+ channels had been blocked, but not with spike trains driven by postsynaptic current injection. The large [Ca2+] increases due to tetanic stimulation were blocked by APV, indicating that NMDA receptor-dependent influx was critical for the large responses. These findings have significant implications for low affinity Ca(2+)-dependent biochemical processes and show a new upper limit for [Ca2+] changes measured in these neurons during stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2059545632,"This study examines the mechanisms of spontaneous and induced [Ca2+]i spiking in nerve growth cones and the effect of spikes on growth cone migration. Over a 10-20 min observation period, 29% of DRG growth cones undergo spontaneous and transient elevations in physiological extracellular Ca2+ ((Ca2+)o; 2 mM), whereas 67% of growth cones exposed to 20 mM (Ca2+)o exhibit similar [Ca2+]i spikes. Spontaneous [Ca2+]i spiking was not observed in neuronal cell bodies or nonneuronal cells. Ca2+ influx through non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels was required for spontaneous [Ca2+]i spikes in growth cones, since removal of (Ca2+)o, or addition of the general Ca2+ channel blockers La3+ or Ni2+, reversibly blocked [Ca2+]i spiking, while blockers of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels did not. Experiments using agents that influence intracellular Ca2+ stores suggest that Ca2+ stores may buffer and release Ca2+ during growth cone [Ca2+]i spikes. Growth cone migration was immediately and transiently inhibited by [Ca2+]i spikes, but eventually returned to prespike rates."
https://openalex.org/W2003105539,"Plexin (previously referred to as B2) is a neuronal cell surface molecule that has been identified in Xenopus. cDNA cloning reveals that plexin has no homology to known neuronal cell surface molecules but possesses, in its extracellular segment, three internal repeats of cysteine clusters that are homologous to the cysteine-rich domain of the c-met proto-oncogene protein product. The exogenous plexin proteins expressed on the surfaces of L cells by cDNA transfection mediate cell adhesion via a homophilic binding mechanism, under the presence of calcium ions. Plexin is expressed in the receptors and neurons of particular sensory systems. These findings indicate that plexin is a novel calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule and suggest its involvement in specific neuronal cell interaction and/or contact."
https://openalex.org/W2091280104,"Expression of minK protein in Xenopus oocytes induces a slowly activating, voltage-dependent, potassium-selective current. Point mutations in minK that alter current gating kinetics, ion selectivity, pharmacology, and response to protein kinase C all support the notion that minK is a structural protein for a channel-type transporter. Yet, minK has just 130 amino acids and a single transmembrane domain. Though larger cloned potassium channels form functional channels through tetrameric subunit association, the subunit composition of minK is unknown. Subunit stoichiometry was determined by coexpression of wild-type minK and a dominant lethal point mutant of minK, which reaches the plasma membrane but passes no current. The results support a model for complete minK potassium channels in which just two minK monomers are present, with other, as yet unidentified, non-minK subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2004794055,"The p53 tumor suppressor is implicated here as a crucial barrier to unlimited cell proliferation. Its role in transformation of hematopoietic cells was studied by infecting fetal liver cells from wild-type or p53-/- mice with oncogenic retroviruses. Transformed colonies arose with a raf and a myc-raf virus. Absence of p53 did not affect their frequency but proved critical for their continued propagation. Colonies of p53-/- cells bearing both myc and raf readily yielded continuous cell lines without apparent requirement for genetic alteration. The lines, mainly of erythroid or myelomonocytic origin, were diploid but highly tumorigenic from their inception. These findings imply that p53 loss contributes directly to immortalization and tumorigenesis, probably by abrogating an intrinsic senescence program."
https://openalex.org/W2093944632,"A yeast TBP mutant (N2-1) is described here that is defective specifically in responding to acidic activators in vivo. N2-1 does not support activation by Gal4, Ace1, and Gcn4, but appears unaffected for constitutive transcription, repression by the Cyc8-Tup1 and Not complexes, and transcription by polymerase I (Pol) and Pol III. In vitro, N2-1 fails to interact with TFIIA, but it associates normally with a TATA element, an acidic activation domain, and TFIIB. Fusion of the small subunit of TFIIA to N2-1 restores activation function in vivo. Thus, an efficient interaction between TBP and TFIIA is required for transcriptional activation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2051570420,"Granule cells in the guinea pig dentate gyrus release kappa opioid neuropeptides, dynorphins, from dendrites as well as from axon terminals. We have found that both L- and N-type calcium channel antagonists inhibited dendritic dynorphin release. In contrast, N-type but not L-type calcium channel antagonists inhibited axonal dynorphin release. Neither L- nor N-type channel antagonists directly altered the effects of kappa opioid receptor activation. By inhibiting dynorphin release, L-type channel antagonists also facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation of the perforant path-granule cell synapse. These studies establish that a single cell type can release a transmitter from two different cellular domains and provide new distinction between axonal and dendritic transmitter release mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2056221836,"The CIC family is the superfamily of voltage-gated Cl- channels. Although the CIC channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes have been characterized, their channel properties are still poorly understood. We recently cloned a unique member of the CIC family, CIC-3, that is expressed abundantly in neurons. Its channel activity was regulated by phorbol esters. Now, we have established a stably transfected somatic cell line expressing functional CIC-3 channels and examined the CIC-3 single-channel current by patch-clamp techniques. In inside-out patches from the stably transfected cells, a rise of bath Ca2+ concentration in the physiological range of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations inhibited the CIC-3 single-channel currents. This inhibition by Ca2+ was independent of phosphorylation and ATP. Thus, the CIC-3 channel is a Ca(2+)-sensitive Cl- channel localized in neuronal cells, and its Ca2+ sensitivity implies a physiological role in neuronal functions."
https://openalex.org/W2012950216,"Homologous strand exchange is a central step in general genetic recombination. A multiprotein complex composed of five purified bacteriophage T4 proteins (the products of the uvsX, uvsY, 32, 41, and 59 genes) that mediates strand exchange under physiologically relevant conditions has been reconstituted. One of these proteins, the product of the uvsY gene, is required for homologous pairing but strongly inhibits branch migration catalyzed by UvsX protein, the phage RecA analog. Branch migration is completely dependent on the gene 41 protein, a DNA helicase that also functions in phage replication. The helicase is delivered to the strand exchange complex by the gene 59 accessory protein in a strand-specific fashion through direct interactions between the gene 59 and gene 32 proteins. These data suggest that strand transferases such as UvsX protein are essential for homologous pairing in vivo, but that a DNA helicase drives polar branch migration."
https://openalex.org/W1970850296,"In normal Drosophila melanogaster oocytes, meiosis arrests at metaphase I and resumes after oocyte passage through the oviduct. Thus, metaphase arrest defines a control point in the meiotic cell cycle. Metaphase arrest only occurs in oocytes that have undergone at least one meiotic exchange. Here it is shown that crossovers between homologs attached to the same centromere do not induce metaphase arrest. Hence, exchanges induce metaphase arrest only when they physically conjoin two separate kinetochores. Thus, the signal that mediates metaphase arrest is not the exchange event per se but the resulting tension on homologous kinetochores."
https://openalex.org/W2084692196,"Atomic force microscope images of zinc arachidate (ZnA2) Langmuir-Blodgett films show that three- and five-layer films are ""hexatic,"" with long-range bond-orientational order and short-range positional correlations of three to five lattice repeats. The monolayer in contact with the substrate is disordered. Films of seven or more layers of ZnA2 are crystalline. A population of dislocations, most likely originating at the substrate, disrupts the positional but not the orientational order of the lattice, leading to hexatic layers intermediate between crystal and liquid. The influence of the substrate propagates farther into ZnA2 films than into cadmium arachidate films because the molecular cohesion is much weaker in ZnA2 than in cadmium arachidate, as evidenced by a less dense molecular packing."
https://openalex.org/W1994902154,"The crystal structure of an aminimide analog of a dipeptide inhibitor of porcine pancreatic elastase bound to its target serine protease has been solved. The peptidomimetic molecule binds in the same fashion as the class of dipeptides from which it was derived, making similar interactions with the subsites on the elastase surface. Because aminimides are readily synthesized from a wide variety of starting materials, they form the basis for a combinatorial chemistry approach to rational drug design."
