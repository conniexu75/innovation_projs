https://openalex.org/W1968931043,"The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed ""bivalent domains,"" consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency."

We have mapped the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) subunit SUZ12 across the entire nonrepeat portion of the genome in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found that SUZ12 is distributed across large portions of over two hundred genes encoding key developmental regulators. These genes are occupied by nucleosomes trimethylated at histone H3K27, are transcriptionally repressed, and contain some of the most highly conserved noncoding elements in the genome. We found that PRC2 target genes are preferentially activated during ES cell differentiation and that the ES cell regulators OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG cooccupy a significant subset of these genes. These results indicate that PRC2 occupies a special set of developmental genes in ES cells that must be repressed to maintain pluripotency and that are poised for activation during ES cell differentiation.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are a unique self-renewing cell type that can give rise to the ectodermal, endodermal, and mesodermal germ layers during embryogenesis. Human ES cells, which can be propagated in culture in an undifferentiated state but selectively induced to differentiate into many specialized cell types, are thought to hold great promise for regenerative medicine (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A.

The gene expression program of ES cells must allow these cells to maintain a pluripotent state but also allow for differentiation into more specialized states when signaled to do so. Learning how this is accomplished may be key to realizing the therapeutic potential of ES cells and further understanding early development. Among regulators of development, the Polycomb group proteins (PcG) are of special interest. These regulators were first described in Drosophila, where they repress the homeotic genes controlling segment identity in the developing embryo (Lewis, 1978Lewis E.B.

PRC2 and its related complexes, PRC3 and PRC4, contain the core components EZH2, SUZ12, and EED (Kuzmichev et al., 2004Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D.

USA. 2005; 102: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). EZH2 is a H3K27 methyltransferase, and SUZ12 (Suppressor of zeste 12) is required for this activity (Cao and Zhang, 2004Cao R. Zhang Y. SUZ12 is required for both the histone methyltransferase activity and the silencing function of the EED-EZH2 complex.Mol.

ES cell lines cannot be established from Ezh2-deficient blastocysts (O'Carroll et al., 2001O'Carroll D. Erhardt S. Pagani M. Barton S.C. Surani M.A. Jenuwein T. The polycomb-group gene Ezh2 is required for early mouse development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4330-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), suggesting that PRC2 is involved in regulating pluripotency and self-renewal. Although the PRCs are known to repress individual HOX genes (van der Lugt et al., 1996van der Lugt N.M. Alkema M. Berns A. Deschamps J.

Cell. 2004; 15: 57-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), it is not clear how these important PcG regulators contribute to early development in vertebrates. Because the nature of PRC2 target genes in ES cells might reveal why PRC2 is essential for early embryonic development, pluripotency, and self-renewal, we have mapped the sites occupied by the SUZ12 subunit throughout the genome in human ES cells. This genome-wide map reveals that PRC2 is associated with a remarkable cadre of genes encoding key regulators of developmental processes that are repressed in ES cells. The genes occupied by PRC2 contain nucleosomes that are trimethylated at histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27me3), a modification catalyzed by PRC2 and associated with the repressed chromatin state. Both PRC2 and nucleosomes with histone H3K27me3 occupy surprisingly large genomic domains around these developmental regulators and are frequently associated with highly conserved noncoding sequence elements previously identified by comparative genomic methods. The transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, which are also key regulators of ES cell pluripotency and self-renewal, occupy a significant subset of these genes. Thus, the model of epigenetic regulation of homeotic genes extends to a large set of developmental regulators whose repression in ES cells appears to be key to pluripotency. We suggest that PRC2 functions in ES cells to repress developmental genes that are preferentially activated during differentiation. We mapped the location of both RNA polymerase II and the SUZ12 subunit of PRC2 genome-wide in human ES cells (Figure 1). The initiating form of RNA polymerase II was mapped to test the accuracy of the method and provide a reference for comparison with sites occupied by PRC2. The SUZ12 subunit of PRC2 is critical for the function of the complex and was selected for these genome-wide experiments. Human ES cells (H9, NIH code WA09) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for characteristic stem cell markers, tested for their ability to generate cell types from all three germ layers upon differentiation into embryoid bodies, and shown to form teratomas in immunocompromised mice (Supplemental Data; Figures S1–S3). DNA sequences bound by RNA polymerase II were identified in replicate chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using DNA microarrays that contain over 4.6 million unique 60-mer oligonucleotide probes spanning the entire nonrepeat portion of the human genome (Figure 1 and Supplemental Data). To obtain a probabilistic assessment of binding events, an algorithm was implemented that incorporates information from multiple probes representing contiguous regions of the genome, and threshold criteria were established to identify a dataset with minimal false positives and false negatives. RNA polymerase II was associated with the promoters of 7,106 of the approximately 22,500 annotated human genes, indicating that one-third of protein-coding genes are prepared to be transcribed in ES cells. Three lines of evidence suggest this dataset is of high quality. Most of the RNA polymerase II sites (87%) occurred at promoters of known or predicted genes. Transcripts were detected for 88% of the genes bound by RNA polymerase II in previous expression experiments in ES cells. Finally, independent analysis using gene-specific PCR (Supplemental Data) indicated that the frequency of false positives was approximately 4% and the frequency of false negatives was approximately 30% in this dataset. A detailed analysis of the RNA polymerase II dataset, including binding to miRNA genes, can be found in Supplemental Data (Tables S1–S6 and Figures S4 and S5). The sites occupied by SUZ12 were then mapped throughout the entire nonrepeat genome in H9 ES cells using the same approach described for RNA polymerase II (Figure 1C). SUZ12 was associated with the promoters of 1,893 of the approximately 22,500 annotated human genes, indicating that −8% of protein-coding genes are occupied by SUZ12 in ES cells (Supplemental Data; Tables S7 and S8). Independent site-specific analysis indicated that the frequency of false positives was approximately 3% and the frequency of false negatives was approximately 27% in this dataset. Comparison of the genes occupied by SUZ12 with those occupied by RNA polymerase II revealed that the two sets were largely exclusive (Figure 1D; Supplemental Data; Table S8). There were, however, genes where SUZ12 and RNA polymerase II cooccupied promoters. At these genes, PRC complexes may fail to block assembly of the preinitiation complex (Dellino et al., 2004Dellino G.I. Schwartz Y.B. Farkas G. McCabe D. Elgin S.C. Pirrotta V. Polycomb silencing blocks transcription initiation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 887-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), consistent with the observation that Polycomb group proteins can associate with components of the general transcription apparatus (Breiling et al., 2001Breiling A.

The vast majority of SUZ12 bound sites were found at gene promoters (Figure 1E). Ninety-five percent of the SUZ12 bound regions were found within 1 kb of known or predicted transcription start sites (Supplemental Data and Table S7). This suggests that SUZ12 functions in human ES cells primarily at promoters rather than at distal regulatory elements. It is interesting that 40% of all SUZ12 bound regions are within 1 Kb of CpG islands (Table S7), given the recent discovery of a mechanistic link between PcG proteins and DNA methyltransferoses (Vire et al., 2006Vire E. Brenner C. Deplus R. Blanchon L. Fraga M. Didelot C. Morey L. Van Eynde A. Bernard D. Vanderwinden J.M. Bollen M. Esteller M. Di Croce L. de Launoit Y. Fuks F. The Polycomb group protein EZH2 directly controls DNA methylation.Nature. 2006; 439: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). PRC2 is composed of three core subunits, SUZ12, EED, and EZH2, and has been shown to mediate histone H3K27 methylation at specific genes in vivo. To confirm that SUZ12 is associated with active PRC2 at target genes, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against EED and the histone H3K27me3 mark and analyzed the results with promoter microarrays. We found that EED and the histone H3K27me3 mark cooccurred with SUZ12 at most genes using a high-confidence binding threshold (Figure 2). The false negative rates of thresholded data can lead to an underestimate of the similarity between different datasets. Plotting raw enrichment ratios for genes associated with SUZ12, EED, or H3K27me3 demonstrates that SUZ12 binding represents PRC2 binding at almost all target genes (Figure S6). Genetic and biochemical studies at selected genes indicate that PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation represses gene expression, but it has not been established if it acts as a repressor genome-wide. If genes occupied by SUZ12 are repressed by PRC2, then transcripts from these genes should generally be present at lower levels in ES cells than in differentiated cell types. To test this prediction, we compared the expression levels of PRC2-occupied genes in four different ES cell lines with the expression level of these genes in 79 differentiated human cell and tissue types (Sato et al., 2003Sato N. Sanjuan I.M. Heke M. Uchida M. Naef F. Brivanlou A.H. Molecular signature of human embryonic stem cells and its comparison with the mouse.Dev.

USA. 2004; 101: 6062-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). We found that PRC2 occupied genes were generally underexpressed in ES cells relative to other cell types (Figure 2C). A small fraction of the genes occupied by PRC2 were relatively overexpressed in ES cells (Figure 2C); these tended to show less extensive SUZ12 occupancy and were more likely to be cooccupied by RNA polymerase II (Supplemental Data). These results are consistent with the model that PRC2-mediated histone H3K27 methylation promotes gene silencing at the majority of its target genes throughout the genome in ES cells. Examination of the targets of SUZ12 revealed that they were remarkably enriched for genes that control development and transcription (Figure 3) and that SUZ12 tended to occupy large domains at these genes (Figure 4). Although only 8% of all annotated genes were occupied by SUZ12, ∼50% of those encoding transcription factors associated with developmental processes were occupied by SUZ12. By comparison, RNA polymerase II preferentially occupied genes involved in a broad spectrum of cell proliferation functions such as nucleic acid metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell cycle (Figure 3A and examples in Figure 1B; Supplemental Data; Table S10).Figure 4SUZ12 Occupies Large Portions of Genes Encoding Transcription Factors with Roles in DevelopmentShow full caption(A) The fraction of SUZ12 target genes associated with different sizes of binding domains.

Unprocessed enrichment ratios for all probes within a genomic region are shown (ChIP versus whole genomic DNA). Approximate HOX cluster region sizes are indicated within black bars. It was striking that SUZ12 occupied many families of genes that control development and transcription (Figures 3B and S7 and Table S11). These included 39 of 40 of the homeotic genes found in the HOX clusters and the majority of homeodomain genes. SUZ12 bound homeodomain genes included almost all members of the DLX, IRX, LHX, and PAX gene families, which regulate early developmental steps in neurogenesis, hematopoiesis, axial patterning, tissue patterning, organogenesis, and cell-fate specification. SUZ12 also occupied promoters for large subsets of the FOX, SOX, and TBX gene families. The forkhead family of FOX genes is involved in axial patterning and tissue development from all three germ layers (Lehmann et al., 2003Lehmann O.J. Sowden J.C. Carlsson P. Jordan T. Bhattacharya S.S. Fox's in development and disease.Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Mutations in members of the SOX gene family alter cell-fate specification and differentiation and are linked to several developmental diseases (Schepers et al., 2002Schepers G.E. Teasdale R.D. Koopman P. Twenty pairs of sox: extent, homology, and nomenclature of the mouse and human sox transcription factor gene families.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 167-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The TBX family of genes regulates a wide variety of developmental processes such as gastrulation, early pattern formation, organogenesis, and limb formation (Showell et al., 2004Showell C. Binder O. Conlon F.L. T-box genes in early embryogenesis.Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, the genes preferentially bound by SUZ12 have functions that, when expressed, promote differentiation. This is likely to explain, at least in part, why PRC2 is essential for early development and ES cell pluripotency. A remarkable feature of PRC2 binding at most genes encoding developmental regulators was the extensive span over which the regulator occupied the locus (Figures 4, S8, and S9). For the majority (72%) of bound"

In Arabidopsis , perception of flagellin increases resistance to the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae , although the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we show that a flagellin-derived peptide induces a plant microRNA (miRNA) that negatively regulates messenger RNAs for the F-box auxin receptors TIR1, AFB2, and AFB3. Repression of auxin signaling restricts P. syringae growth, implicating auxin in disease susceptibility and miRNA-mediated suppression of auxin signaling in resistance."

These coevolutionary networks are highly asymmetric, so that if a plant species depends strongly on an animal species, the animal depends weakly on the plant. By using a simple dynamical model, we showed that asymmetries inherent in coevolutionary networks may enhance long-term coexistence and facilitate biodiversity maintenance."

Bone mass is increased and osteoclastic resorption is decreased in haploinsufficient FSHbeta+/- mice with normal ovarian function, suggesting that the skeletal action of FSH is estrogen independent.

We determined the 2.2 Å resolution structure of the core of the Drosophila DEAD-box protein Vasa in complex with a single-stranded RNA and an ATP analog. The ATP analog intensively interacts with both of the domains, thereby bringing them into the closed form, with many interdomain interactions of conserved residues. The bound RNA is sharply bent, avoiding a clash with a conserved α helix in the N-terminal domain. This “wedge” helix should disrupt base pairs by bending one of the strands when a duplex is bound. Mutational analyses indicated that the interdomain interactions couple ATP hydrolysis to RNA unwinding, probably through fine positioning of the duplex relative to the wedge helix. This mechanism, which differs from those for canonical translocating helicases, may enable the targeted modulation of intricate RNA structures.

This mechanism, which differs from those for canonical translocating helicases, may enable the targeted modulation of intricate RNA structures. Higher-order structures of RNA are formed by intramolecular and intermolecular base pairs and are important for their functions. RNA helicases regulate various cellular processes involving RNAs by catalyzing the alteration of higher-order RNA structures, such as secondary-structure melting, strand separation (Luking et al., 1998Luking A. Stahl U. Schmidt U. The protein family of RNA helicases.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and RNA-protein dissociation (Fairman et al., 2004Fairman M.E. Maroney P.A. Wang W. Bowers H.A. Gollnick P. Nilsen T.W.

The structural rearrangements are coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis. DEAD-box proteins, which were named after the strictly conserved sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (D-E-A-D), are widely found from bacteria to human and constitute by far the largest RNA helicase family (Linder et al., 1989Linder P. Lasko P.F. Ashburner M. Leroy P. Nielsen P.J. Nishi K. Schnier J. Slonimski P.P. Birth of the D-E-A-D box.Nature. 1989; 337: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The DEAD-box proteins are involved in many aspects of RNA metabolism, such as transcription, splicing, transport, translation, and degradation of mRNA and ribosome biogenesis (Rocak and Linder, 2004Rocak S. Linder P. DEAD-box proteins: the driving forces behind RNA metabolism.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). So far, 26 DEAD-box protein-coding genes have been identified in the yeast genome, and most of them are essential for viability (de la Cruz et al., 1999de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Unwinding RNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: DEAD-box proteins and related families.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The DEAD-box family belongs to helicase superfamily II (SF2), the largest helicase superfamily, which also includes the DEAH-box and Snf2 families (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Helicases: amino acid sequence comparisons and structure-function relationships.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (990) Google Scholar). In the SF2 proteins, the core consists of two tandemly repeated RecA-like domains, with motifs I, Ia, Ib, II, and III in the N-terminal RecA-like domain (NTD) and motifs IV, V, and VI in the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Caruthers and McKay, 2002Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Helicase structure and mechanism.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The DEAD sequence is located in motif II. Subsequent studies identified three additional motifs that are characteristic of the DEAD-box proteins (the Q and GG motifs in the NTD and the QxxR motif in the CTD) (Caruthers et al., 2000Caruthers J.M.

In these structures, the NTD and the CTD each conserve their folds, but the interdomain orientations are strikingly diverse. Motifs I and II in the NTD bind ATP or ADP (Benz et al., 1999Benz J.

A prototype of the DEAD-box proteins is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), which melts the secondary structures in the 5′UTR of mRNA and thereby facilitates ribosome scanning (Gingras et al., 1999Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. eIF4 initiation factors: effectors of mRNA recruitment to ribosomes and regulators of translation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). It consists only of the tandem RecA-like domains, or the “helicase core.” First, eIF4A was shown to unwind 5′- or 3′-tailed RNA duplexes in the presence of another translation initiation factor, eIF4B (Rozen et al., 1990Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Bidirectional RNA helicase activity of eucaryotic translation initiation factors 4A and 4F.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Later, it was found that eIF4A by itself can unwind short RNA duplexes (Rogers et al., 1999Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. Biochemical and kinetic characterization of the RNA helicase activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and blunt-ended duplexes (Rogers et al., 2001Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. Further characterization of the helicase activity of eIF4A. Substrate specificity.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, eIF4A does not unwind a long stretch of duplex (Rogers et al., 1999Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. Biochemical and kinetic characterization of the RNA helicase activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These biochemical characteristics are quite different from those of other well-studied SF2 proteins. For example, hepatitis C virus NS3, an SF2 protein that unwinds both DNA and RNA, “processively” unwinds a long stretch of duplex and requires a single-stranded “loading strand” on the 3′ side of the substrate (Pang et al., 2002Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. The hepatitis C viral NS3 protein is a processive DNA helicase with cofactor enhanced RNA unwinding.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the mechanistic models of these helicases, the tandem RecA-like domains are proposed to work in concert with other auxiliary domains: The RecA-like domains act as a “motor” to translocate the bound single-stranded nucleic acid, while the auxiliary domain (or domains) acts as a “wedge” by providing steric hindrance with the other strand. Therefore, it is unlikely that the same model is applicable to the DEAD-box proteins. Clues to the unwinding mechanism of the DEAD-box proteins have been provided by mutant studies. The motif II DEAD-to-DEAH mutation and another mutation in motif III of eIF4A impaired the RNA unwinding activity but did not reduce the RNA binding and ATPase activities (Pause and Sonenberg, 1992Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mutational analysis of a DEAD box RNA helicase: the mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-4A.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, how the DEAD-box proteins couple ATP hydrolysis to RNA unwinding and how this coupling is impaired in the mutants remained compelling questions. Drosophila melanogaster Vasa is essential for development (Hay et al., 1988Hay B. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

Ashburner M. The product of the Drosophila gene vasa is very similar to eukaryotic initiation factor-4A.Nature. 1988; 335: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In the developing embryo, Vasa is localized in polar granules, and, through its interaction with eIF5B (Carrera et al., 2000Carrera P. Johnstone O. Nakamura A. Casanova J. Jackle H. Lasko P. VASA mediates translation through interaction with a Drosophila yIF2 homolog.Mol.

Vasa homologs are specifically expressed in the germlines of higher eukaryotes, including human (Raz, 2000Raz E. The function and regulation of vasa-like genes in germ-cell development.Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (REVIEWS1017. Published online September 1, 2000)https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2000-1-3-reviews1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An uncoupling between ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding was observed for the protein product of one mutant allele of D. melanogaster vasa, vasD5, which has a mutation in motif V (Liang et al., 1994Liang L. Diehl-Jones W. Lasko P. Localization of vasa protein to the Drosophila pole plasm is independent of its RNA-binding and helicase activities.Development. 1994; 120: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we solved the crystal structure of the helicase-core region of Vasa bound with a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and AMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, at 2.2 Å resolution. In the structure, which represents the ATP bound closed form, the two RecA-like domains closely interact with each other and form the functional ATPase site. The two domains also interact with the bound RNA. The NTD induces a sharp bend on the 3′ side of the RNA by providing steric hindrance with an α helix. Conserved residues form interaction networks at the ATPase and RNA binding sites, which are important for coupling ATP hydrolysis to RNA unwinding. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for RNA unwinding by DEAD-box proteins. The Vasa protein fragment (residues 200–623), containing the helicase core, was prepared, and the complex with synthetic poly(U) RNA (U10) and AMPPNP was crystallized (Sengoku et al., 2004Sengoku T.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex was determined at 2.2 Å resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using a selenomethionine-substituted protein (Table 1; see also Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The final model contains residues 202–621 of Vasa, seven uridine residues, one AMPPNP molecule, and one Mg2+ ion per complex. The four independent complexes in the crystallographic asymmetric unit are essentially the same (pairwise root-mean-square deviations of 0.24–0.37 Å over all modeled α-carbons).Table 1Crystallographic StatisticsData CollectionData setNativeSe peakSe edgeSe remote1Se remote2Wavelength (Å)0.91200.97940.97960.98400.9710Resolution (Å)aNumbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.50–2.20 (2.24–2.20)50–2.40 (2.44–2.40)50–3.00 (3.11–3.00)50–3.00 (3.11–3.00)50–3.00 (3.11–3.00)Observations321,846583,066148,849150,949145,347Unique reflections117,511101,78551,45750,42750,777Completeness (%)aNumbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.89.6 (74.6)97.5 (78.1)95.6 (88.6)96.8 (91.9)95.5 (88.5)Mean I/σaNumbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.16.8 (2.2)8.0 (1.6)8.6 (2.8)9.0 (3.2)8.7 (2.9)Rmerge (%)aNumbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.,bRmerge = Σj|Ij − <I>|/ΣIj, where Ij is the intensity of the jth reflection and <I> is the average intensity.7.5 (30.5)15.3 (45.4)11.3 (25.5)11.9 (23.6)10.7 (24.8)PhasingPhasing power iso/ano0.83/1.060.50/0.36−/0.050.40/0.47Figure of merit0.39RefinementResolution (Å)Rfree (%)Rwork (%)Rmsd bond (Å)Rmsd angle (°)50–2.2025.019.70.008451.45a Numbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.b Rmerge = Σj|Ij − <I>|/ΣIj, where Ij is the intensity of the jth reflection and <I> is the average intensity.

The relative orientation of the two domains in the present Vasa structure significantly differs from those in the other helicase-core structures of DEAD-box proteins, eIF4A, MjDEAD, UAP56, and Dhh1p (Caruthers et al., 2000Caruthers J.M.

In the Vasa structure, the closely arranged NTD and CTD embed the AMPPNP in a deep interdomain cleft and interact with the RNA running perpendicular to the cleft (Figures 2A and 2B). In terms of the interdomain cleft, the Vasa structure is “closed,” whereas all of the other structures are much more “open” (Figure 2C). The interdomain interactions in the Vasa structure are totally different from and more extensive than those in the MjDEAD, UAP56, and Dhh1p structures (Cheng et al., 2005Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R.

Furthermore, the two domains of eIF4A are completely separated and form a “dumbbell” structure (Caruthers et al., 2000Caruthers J.M. Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Crystal structure of yeast initiation factor 4A, a DEAD-box RNA helicase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 13080-13085Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Such domain rearrangements are due to conformational changes in the 8-residue linker region, in which the residues are not conserved among the DEAD-box proteins (Figure 1). The protein-RNA interactions are shown in Figure 3. All of the RNA-interacting residues, except for Arg403 and Glu497, are conserved among the DEAD-box proteins (Figure 1). The NTD and CTD bind the 3′ and 5′ sides of the RNA, respectively (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The phosphate-ribose backbone of the RNA lies along the C-terminal sides of six β strands: The U1–U5 sequence interacts with motif IV (β10), the QxxR motif (β11), and motif V (β12) from the CTD, while the U4–U7 sequence interacts with motif Ia (β3), the GG motif (β4), and motif Ib (β5) from the NTD (Figure 1). U4 and U5 interact with both domains. The protein forms many hydrophilic interactions with the phosphate and 2′-OH groups of the RNA backbone (Figure 3). Four 2′-OH groups are recognized, in agreement with the preference of DEAD-box proteins for RNA over DNA (Rogers et al., 2001Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. Further characterization of the helicase activity of eIF4A. Substrate specificity.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, the protein does not interact with the base moieties of the RNA, except for one hydrogen bond between the nonconserved Arg403 and U3. Within the bound RNA, the U1-U2-U3-U4-U5 bases and the U6-U7 bases are individually stacked, but the U5 and U6 bases are not stacked with each other (Figure 3D). Thus, the overall conformation of the RNA is sharply bent between U5 and U6. The rotamers along the U5-U6 backbone, O3′-P-(α)-O5′-(β)-C5′-(γ)-C4′-C3′, are unusual trans(α)-gauche+(β)-trans(γ) forms (Figure 3A and Figure S1). The U6 phosphate, located at the bending point, is extensively recognized by the amide groups of Gly354 (GG) and Arg378 (Ib) and the side chains of Arg328 (Ia) and Thr375 (Ib). The U7 phosphate is recognized by the amide group of Gly355 (GG) and the side chain of Arg378 (Ib), whereas the 2′-OH group of U6 is recognized by the side chains of Arg378 and Asp381 (Ib) (Figures 3A and 3D). When an A form RNA duplex was modeled on the Vasa protein by superposition of one of the two strands on the U1–U5 region of the bound ssRNA, the modeled nucleotide corresponding to U6 sterically clashed with the α7 helix (Figure 3E). The structural comparison of the NTDs revealed that the positions of the α7 helix of Vasa and its equivalents in other DEAD-box proteins are well conserved (Figure 3F). In contrast, the α7 helix equivalents of the SF2 proteins belonging to other subfamilies are not superposable and would cause no steric clash (Figure 3G). Therefore, the bent structure of the bound RNA seems to be a unique feature of the DEAD-box proteins and is likely to be important for their mechanism (see below). The U1–U5 region interacts with both domains (Figures 3A–3D). The U5 phosphate is bound with the main chain of Arg328 (Ia) and the side chain of Arg528 (QxxR), while its 2′-OH group is bound with the main chain of Gly377 (Ib). The Arg528 equivalents in eIF4A and Dhh1p were predicted to bind RNA (Caruthers et al., 2000Caruthers J.M. Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Crystal structure of yeast initiation factor 4A, a DEAD-box RNA helicase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 13080-13085Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, Cheng et al., 2005Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R. Song H. Crystal structure and functional analysis of DEAD-box protein Dhh1p.RNA. 2005; 11: 1258-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The U4 phosphate is bound with the side chain of Thr546 (V) and the main chain of Gly521 (QxxR), while its 2′-OH group is bound with the main chain of Pro326 (Ia). The U3 phosphate is bound with the main chain of Lys499 (IV), while the 2′-OH group of U2 is bound with the side chain of Glu497 (IV). Furthermore, a network of interdomain interactions is formed at the RNA binding site (Figures 3B and 3D). Two of the RNA binding arginines, Arg328 and Arg528, stack with each other and form interdomain interactions with Gln525 (QxxR) and Glu329 (Ia), respectively. In addition, Gln525 and Glu329, which are well conserved among the DEAD-box proteins, interact with each other. Therefore, the conserved hydrophilic residues of the two domains form complicated interactions, thus creating the continuous RNA binding surface. Probably because of the interdomain interactions, the conformation of the QxxR motif is characteristically different from those of other DEAD-box proteins without bound RNA (Figure S2). These features are characteristic of the closed form. The ATP binding pocket is formed between the two RecA-like domains. AMPPNP interacts with the amino acid residues from the flanking sequence, the Q motif, motif I (also known as the Walker A motif or P loop), motif II (the Walker B motif), motif V, and motif VI (Figure 1 and Figure 3). Motif V is the only motif that interacts with both the RNA and AMPPNP. Except for the residues in the Vasa-specific flanking sequence, all of the residues involved in the ATP binding and hydrolysis are conserved among the DEAD-box proteins (Figure 1). The conformations of motifs III, V, and VI significantly differ from those of other ATP-free DEAD-box proteins (Figure S2). From the flanking sequence, Phe225 makes a van der Waals interaction with the adenine base (Figure S3). From the NTD, motifs I and II and the Q motif interact with the AMPPNP (Figure 3A and Figure S3) in a manner similar to in the structures of eIF4A and UAP56 (Benz et al., 1999Benz J. Trachsel H.

We show here that the change in conductivity is bolometric (caused by heating of the SWNT network). Electron-phonon interactions lead to ultrafast relaxation of the photoexcited carriers, and the energy of the incident infrared (IR) radiation is efficiently transferred to the crystal lattice. It is not the presence of photoexcited holes and electrons, but a rise in temperature, that results in a change in resistance; thus, photoconductivity experiments cannot be used to support the band picture over the exciton model of excited states in carbon nanotubes. The photoresponse of suspended SWNT films is sufficiently high that they may function as the sensitive element of an IR bolometric detector."

Influenza virus illustrates the interaction of factors that limit the transmission and subsequent establishment of an infection in a novel host species. Influenza species barriers can be categorized into virus-host interactions occurring within individuals and host-host interactions, either within or between species, that affect transmission between individuals. Viral evolution can help surmount species barriers, principally by affecting virus-host interactions; however, evolving the capability for sustained transmission in a new host species represents a major adaptive challenge because the number of mutations required is often large."

We demonstrate that the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) of T. gondii accumulates material coming from the host mammalian cell via the exploitation of the host endo-lysosomal system. The parasite actively recruits host microtubules, resulting in selective attraction of endo-lysosomes to the PV. Microtubule-based invaginations of the PV membrane serve as conduits for the delivery of host endo-lysosomes within the PV. These tubular conduits are decorated by a parasite coat, including the tubulogenic protein GRA7, which acts like a garrote that sequesters host endocytic organelles in the vacuolar space. These data define an unanticipated process allowing the parasite intimate and concentrated access to a diverse range of low molecular weight components produced by the endo-lysosomal system. More generally, they identify a unique mechanism for unidirectional transport and sequestration of host organelles."

The development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms largely depends on cell-to-cell communication for the establishment and coordination of cell fates and the control of organ growth. Certain signaling molecules form concentration or activity gradients to provide cells in a tissue with positional information. Members of the Hedgehog and Wnt families of secreted signaling proteins, for example, induce subsets of target genes at defined distances from their source by activating conserved transduction cascades. Aberrant activation of these pathways can lead to various types of human cancer (Taipale and Beachy, 2001Taipale J. Beachy P.A.

Wnt signaling in the intestinal epithelium: from endoderm to cancer.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The canonical Wnt/Wingless (Wg) pathway controls transcription of target genes via its central component β-catenin (or its Drosophila homolog Armadillo, Arm), which serves as an interaction hub for a complex array of membrane-associated, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins (reviewed by Daniels et al., 2001Daniels D.L. Eklof Spink K. Weis W.I. beta-catenin: molecular plasticity and drug design.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 672-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At the cell membrane, β-catenin associates with α-catenin and E-cadherin in adherens junctions to provide a cell adhesion function. The remaining cytoplasmic β-catenin protein is constitutively marked for proteasomal degradation by Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β (GSK-3β)-mediated phosphorylation (reviewed by Peifer and Polakis, 2000Peifer M. Polakis P. Wnt signaling in oncogenesis and embryogenesis–a look outside the nucleus.Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). GSK-3β is part of a degradation complex also comprising Axin and APC, the product of the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli tumor suppressor gene. Upon binding of an extracellular Wnt ligand to members of the Frizzled (Fz) and LRP/Arrow receptors, Dishevelled (Dsh) is activated and assumed to disrupt the β-catenin degradation complex. As a result, the levels of free cytoplasmic β-catenin rise, and β-catenin enters the nucleus and interacts with TCF/LEF DNA binding proteins to initiate transcription of Wnt-responsive genes (reviewed by Nelson and Nusse, 2004Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Convergence of Wnt, β-Catenin, and Cadherin pathways.Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar). Key to understanding the evolution and function of β-catenin signaling and the consequences of aberrant β-catenin activity in cancer is the question of how a cell adhesion component, relocated to the nucleus, can promote and sustain transcription of genes. Although a number of interacting proteins have been identified, it is still poorly understood how they endow β-catenin with the ability to control the transcription of its targets. For example, the recent discovery and characterization of BCL9/Legless (Lgs) and Pygopus (Pygo) indicated that Lgs links Pygo to β-catenin to form a core complex with TCF/LEF (Kramps et al., 2002Kramps T.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1207-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but how this complex uses Pygo to control the transcription of Wnt targets remains a mystery. β-catenin consists of a central region containing 12 stacked Arm repeats flanked by structurally less well defined N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD). The Arm repeat region mediates the binding to cadherins, Axin/APC and TCF/LEF, allowing β-catenin to associate with adherens junctions, its destruction complex, or indirectly with DNA, respectively. Various lines of experimental evidence suggest that the two main outputs of β-catenin relating to its transcriptional activity emanate from its most N-terminally located Arm repeats as well as from its C-terminal region (Orsulic and Peifer, 1996Orsulic S.

The N-terminal activity can be attributed to the recruitment of Lgs and Pygo (Hoffmans et al., 2005Hoffmans R. Städeli R. Basler K.

In contrast, the transactivation activity imparted by the C-terminal part appears to be more complex since at least for Arm it has been found to stem from several subregions, of which the region closest to Arm repeat 12 plays the most important role for pathway output in vivo (Orsulic and Peifer, 1996Orsulic S.

In addition to reorganized chromatin, transcriptional activation also depends on the recruitment and preparation of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) for the initiation and elongation of mRNA synthesis. However, for many signaling cascades, including the Wnt pathway, the mechanisms by which these later steps in transcriptional control are mediated remain poorly understood. In this report, we describe the genetic identification and molecular characterization of Hyrax (Hyx), a novel component of the nuclear Wnt/Wg signaling pathway in Drosophila. Hyx is homologous to yeast Cdc73p, a component of the Polymerase-Associated Factor 1 (PAF1) complex, and is the Drosophila ortholog of human Parafibromin, the protein product of the Hyperparathyroidism-Jaw Tumor syndrome (HTP-JT) tumor suppressor gene HRPT2. Overexpression of Hyx is able to counteract compromised Lgs/Pygo activity. Conversely, reduction of Hyx function in vivo, as well as the knock-down of hyx or HRPT2 expression in cultured cells, abrogates Arm/β-catenin-mediated transduction of Wg and Wnt signals, respectively. These results reveal a novel and unanticipated role for Parafibromin as an important component of nuclear Wnt signaling. Moreover, we show that an N-terminal region of Parafibromin/Hyx directly interacts with the C-terminal region of β-catenin/Arm. Our results suggest a mechanistic model for Wnt/Wg target gene control in which the Pygo-mediated and the C-terminal outputs of β-catenin/Arm converge in the recruitment of the PAF1 complex, thereby activating transcriptional initiation and elongation by RNAPII. In a previous effort to isolate rate-limiting components of the Wnt/Wg signal transduction pathway, we carried out a screen for dosage-sensitive genes required for the manifestation of a gain-of-Wg-signaling phenotype in the Drosophila eye (Brunner et al., 1997Brunner E.

This screen uncovered mutations in the pangolin (pan), arm, lgs, and pygo genes, encoding the Drosophila homologs of TCF/LEF, β-catenin, BCL9, and Pygo, respectively, which together appear to form a tetrapartite DNA bound complex to control Wnt/Wg target genes (Belenkaya et al., 2002Belenkaya T.Y.

In an attempt to identify factors mediating the transcriptional output of this complex, we designed a complementary assay for genes that upon overexpression ameliorate a partial loss-of-Wg-signaling phenotype. A mutant form of Lgs (Lgs17E), which has weakened Arm binding capacity (Kramps et al., 2002Kramps T. Peter O. Brunner E. Nellen D. Froesch B. Chatterjee S. Murone M. Züllig S. Basler K.

We isolated two allelic EP-element insertions, P9 and P10, which effectively reverted the Lgs17E phenotype (Figure 1D and data not shown) when driven by Gal4 during larval development. However, ectopic gene expression driven by the P9 and P10 elements had no effect (1) on the viability or morphology of wild-type animals, (2) on phenotypes sensitized for the Dpp, Insulin, EGFR, and TNF/Eiger signaling pathways (see Experimental Procedures), nor (3) on the activity of the wing pouch enhancer used to drive Lgs17E expression (Figures 1H–1J). The P9 and P10 elements inserted at cytological position 85C3 between two genes transcribed in opposite directions (Figure 1G): neuralized (neur), which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in Notch signaling (Yeh et al., 2001Yeh E. Dermer M. Commisso C. Zhou L. McGlade C.J. Boulianne G.L. Neuralized functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase during Drosophila development.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1675-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and CG11990, a novel gene that we refer to as hyrax (hyx). Direct UAS-hyx transgenes based on a full-length cDNA faithfully reproduced the reversion activity of the EP-elements (Figure 1E). Taken together, our results indicate that hyx encodes a normally non-rate-limiting product which upon overexpression is able to specifically overcome the dominant-negative action of Lgs17E, raising the possibility that it functions as a novel, positive component in the Wg pathway. To gain more insight into hyx function, we sought to generate mutant hyx alleles. We used the fully penetrant reversion of the Lgs17E phenotype by P9 activity as the basis for an EMS mutagenesis screen. Two revertant P9 chromosomes were recovered which failed to suppress the Lgs17E phenotype (Figure 1F and data not shown) and also failed to complement each other. Sequence analysis of the hyx locus of both chromosomes revealed premature stop codons in the hyx open reading frame (at R505 and Q461, respectively) (Figure 1G). We refer to these mutant hyx alleles as hyx1 and hyx2. We subsequently identified a third, strongly hypomorphic hyx allele, caused by the EP-element insertion EY6898 into the hyx 5′ UTR (hyxEY6898) (Figure 1G). Disruption of hyx function causes lethality during late embryogenesis (hyx1 and hyx2) or shortly after hatching (hyxEY6898) without obvious phenotypes. The early larval lethality of the hyxEY6898 allele could be substantially rescued to pharate adult stages by the presence of a ubiquitous Gal4 driver (rescuing hyx transcript formation from the exogenous promoter of the EP-element). Such animals exhibit severe leg defects with shortened and twisted segments (Figures 1K and 1L), reminiscent of phenotypes caused by hypomorphic pan and pygo alleles (Brunner et al., 1997Brunner E.

Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 535-546Google Scholar). We next generated clones of cells mutant for hyx by FLP-mediated mitotic recombination. Homozygous mutant clones in the adult female germ line did not develop into fertile oocytes. Hence maternal hyx products could not be removed to assess their role in patterning the embryonic epidermis. Similarly, somatic cell clones of the strong alleles hyx1 and hyx2 were rapidly eliminated from imaginal tissues. However, hyxEY6898 mutant cell clones induced 48 hr to 72 hr after egg laying grew readily in all imaginal discs although more slowly than their wild-type twinspots (data not shown). We thus continued our assays using hxyEY6898 with the potential caveat that it might uncover only particularly sensitive aspects of hyx function. hxyEY6898 clones in the wing imaginal disc showed a severe reduction or loss of expression of Distal-less (Dll), a target of the Wg pathway (Zecca et al., 1996Zecca M.

Cohen S.M. Long-range action of Wingless organizes the dorsal-ventral axis of the Drosophila wing.Development. 1997; 124: 871-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures 2A–2C). Failure to upregulate Dll expression could in principle be attributed to either a specific defect in Wg signal transduction or to a general cellular defect. However, expression of the Notch target gene cut (ct), the selector gene engrailed (en), the Hh target genes decapentaplegic (dpp) and patched (ptc), and the Dpp target optomotor-blind (omb) was not impaired in hyxEY6898 mutant clones (Figures 2D–2O and data not shown), arguing against the latter explanation and suggesting instead that the output of the Wg pathway is particularly susceptible to a reduction of hyx activity. Mutant clones of hyx2 and hyxEY6898 could be recovered in adult tissues when given a growth advantage by the Minute technique and were associated with a variety of phenotypes. Commonly observed abnormalities include notches at the wing blade margin and leg defects similar to those of hyx pharate adults (see above, Figures 2P and 2Q). Mutant clones in the notum region frequently caused the absence of thoracic dorsocentral macrochaetae (data not shown), a phenotype previously described for impaired Wg signaling (Phillips and Whittle, 1993Phillips R.G. Whittle J.R. wingless expression mediates determination of peripheral nervous system elements in late stages of Drosophila wing disc development.Development. 1993; 118: 427-438PubMed Google Scholar). We also noted patterning abnormalities that have no obvious relationship to Wg signaling, such as formation of ectopic vein material (Figure 2P) and deformed eye morphology (data not shown). Collectively, therefore, we conclude that hyx is an essential gene and that it is required autonomously in Wg receiving cells for the transduction of the Wg signal. But, unlike dedicated Wg signaling components, such as Lgs and Pygo, Hyx also plays a role in other developmental processes. To validate and extend our examinations of the role of Hyx in the Wg pathway, we used a Drosophila S2 cell signaling assay based on a stably integrated Luciferase reporter construct containing multiple TCF/LEF binding sites (Schweizer and Varmus, 2003Schweizer L. Varmus H. Wnt/Wingless signaling through beta-catenin requires the function of both LRP/Arrow and frizzled classes of receptors.BMC Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The pathway was activated by Wg secreted from cocultured cells (van Leeuwen et al., 1994van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Biological activity of soluble wingless protein in cultured Drosophila imaginal disc cells.Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), resulting in potent induction of Luciferase expression (Figure 3A). Targeting transcripts of the negative regulators Axin and APC2 by RNAi also increased the Luciferase readout, even in the absence of the Wg ligand. Conversely, RNAi against sequences encoding the positively acting components (dsh, arm, lgs, and pygo) strongly reduced the transcriptional response to Wg (Figure 3A and data not shown). Two different dsRNAs for hyx were prepared; both caused a severe reduction of Wg pathway activity (Figure 3A). Importantly, independent Luciferase reporters systems designed to monitor the response to other signals, e.g., Dpp or heavy metal ions, were not significantly affected by hyx RNAi (Figure 3B). These results confirm our conclusion that hyx encodes a product required for Wg signaling output and provide an experimental basis for analyzing the epistatic relationship between Hyx and known components of the Wg pathway. We next employed combinatorial RNAi in our S2-cell reporter system. The transcriptional induction resulting from RNAi against Axin (data not shown) or APC2 was significantly reduced when dsRNA against lgs was included. An even stronger reduction was obtained by administering dsRNA against hyx (Figure 3C). We interpret these observations as an indication that Hyx, like Lgs, acts downstream of the Arm degradation complex in Wg transducing cells. In order to extend these findings to endogenous Wg target genes, we used quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to analyze the transcriptional behavior of D-frizzled 3 (Dfz3), naked cuticle (nkd), and CG5895, three genes presumed to be direct targets of the Arm/Pan complex (Sivasankaran et al., 2000Sivasankaran R. Calleja M. Morata G. Basler K. The Wingless target gene Dfz3 encodes a new member of the Drosophila Frizzled family.Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Zeng et al., 2000Zeng W. Wharton Jr., K.A. Mack J.A. Wang K. Gadbaw M. Suyama K. Klein P.S. Scott M.P. naked cuticle encodes an inducible antagonist of Wnt signalling.Nature. 2000; 403: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (D. Soldini, C.M., and K.B., unpublished data). These genes were readily induced in S2 cells upon RNAi-mediated knock-down of Axin (Figure 3D); the expression of all three genes, however, was reverted to normal levels upon coadministration of RNAi against either lgs or hyx (Figure 3D). Importantly, the transcription of the four Wg independent genes dRheb, TOR, brinker (brk), and dInr showed no significant transcriptional change in response to RNAi against either GFP, Axin, lgs, hyx, or combinations thereof (Figure 3E). Since hyx expression was only severely reduced but not abolished in our in vivo and in vitro experiments, we cannot rule out that pathways other than those governed by Wg also depend on Hyx function but are more resilient to reductions in its activity. In any case, our in vivo and tissue culture results clearly indicate that hyx encodes an important signaling component of the Wg pathway. Interestingly, we found that eukaryotic genomes usually contain a single potential hyx homolog (Figure 4A). The presumptive Hyx protein sequence, however, did not reveal any functionally known domains with high confidence. Based on similarity to the predicted metazoan proteins, we subsequently identified three potential nuclear localization signals (Figure 4B). These observations suggest that Hyx represents a highly conserved and possibly nuclear protein of ancient eukaryotic origin. The best characterized Hyx homolog is Cdc73p (Figures 4A and 4B), a nuclear factor of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Polymerase-Associated Factor 1 (PAF1) complex. The PAF1 complex, comprising the factors Paf1p, Cdc73p, Rtf1p, Ctr9p, and Leo1p, binds to RNAPII via Cdc73p and Rtf1p and coordinates histone modifications associated with transcription (reviewed by Sims et al., 2004Sims 3rd, R.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Elongation by RNA polymerase II: the short and long of it.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Significant sequence similarity between Hyx and Cdc73p is limited to the C-terminal part, starting approximately from amino acid 359 in Hyx (Figure 4B). Interestingly, Hyx shares with its metazoan homologs additional sequence similarities in the N-terminal domain, which are not present in yeast and plants, suggesting that these proteins have acquired metazoan-specific functions (see below). The human homolog of Hyx has recently been discovered to be the product of the HRPT2 tumor suppressor gene involved in Hyperparathyroidism-Jaw Tumor syndrome (HPT-JT) (Carpten et al., 2002Carpten J.D. Robbins C.M. Villablanca A. Forsberg L. et al.HRPT2, encoding parafibromin, is mutated in hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Based on some of this syndrome's characteristic features—parathyroid tumors and ossifying jaw fibromas—this product is referred to as Parafibromin (Carpten et al., 2002Carpten J.D. Robbins C.M. Villablanca A. Forsberg L. et al.HRPT2, encoding parafibromin, is mutated in hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). While the role of Parafibromin in parathyroid glands and other tissues is unknown at present, there is a tight correlation between mutations in HRPT2 and familial, as well as sporadic, cases of this disease (reviewed by Wang et al., 2005Wang P.F. Tan M.H. Zhang C. Morreau H. Teh B.T. HRPT2, a tumor suppressor gene for hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome.Horm. Metab. Res. 2005; 37: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and our previous experimental results, we hypothesized that Hyx—and by extension Parafibromin—represent nuclear factors of a metazoan PAF1 complex which mediate Wnt/Wg target gene activation upon recruitment by the nuclear β-catenin/Arm complex. In the subsequent experiments, we set out to verify and refine this model. To address the functional relationship between Hyx and its human homolog, we generated a UAS-HRPT2 transgene containing the entire Parafibromin protein coding region. As shown in Figures 5A–5C, expression of this transgene fully reverted the Lgs17E-mediated wing notching phenotype. Thus Parafibromin, like Hyx, has the capacity to enhance the output of a compromised Wg pathway upon overexpression. We next established transgenic lines with a construct encoding N-terminally HA-tagged Parafibromin driven by the weak and ubiquitous tubulin-1α promoter (tub1α-HA-HRPT2). All transgene insertions analyzed fully rescued all mutant hyx allele combinations to adulthood without obvious phenotypic defects (Figure 5D). HA-Parafibromin was exclusively found in the nuclei of the transgene-expressing cells, independent of their Wg pathway activity (Figures 5E–5J) and consistent with a nuclear function of Parafibromin/Hyx (Hahn and Marsh, 2005Hahn M.A. Marsh D.J.

An analogous construct encoding yeast Cdc73p (tub1α-HA-cdc73), however, did not show any significant rescue activity (data not shown). Hence Parafibromin, but not Cdc73p, can serve as a functional homolog of Hyx. Together, these findings support our notion that Hyx is a nuclear com"

However, this emerging field depends on development of ligand-directed particles to enable systemic targeted delivery and molecular imaging of reporter trangenes. Currently, eukaryotic viruses unquestionably provide superior transgene delivery and transduction (Kootstra and Verma, 2003Kootstra N.A. Verma I.M. Gene therapy with viral vectors.Annu. Rev.

Toxicol. 2003; 43: 413-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), but ligand-directed targeting of such vectors requires ablation of their native tropism for mammalian cell-membrane receptors (Müller et al., 2003Müller O.J.

In contrast, prokaryotic viruses such as bacteriophage (phage) are considered poor vehicles for mammalian cell transduction. However, despite their inherent shortcomings as “eukaryotic” viruses, phage particles have no tropism for mammalian cells (Barrow and Soothill, 1997Barrow P.A. Soothill J.S.

Phage display-based technology allows direct ligand-directed selection of homing peptides to corresponding receptors selectively expressed in normal or tumor tissues (Hajitou et al., 2006Hajitou A.

We hypothesized that combining the favorable biological attributes of eukaryotic viruses to those of prokaryotic viruses might yield chimeric particles with potential as targeted delivery tools for molecular imaging. Since the genomes of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) and single-stranded phage consist of compatible DNA, we generated novel chimeras between AAV and fd-tet (Zacher et al., 1980Zacher III, A.N. Stock C.A. Golden II, J.W. Smith G.P. A new filamentous phage cloning vector: fd-tet.Gene. 1980; 9: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), an M13-derived filamentous phage, displaying short peptides (Smith and Scott, 1993Smith G.P.

As a proof of concept, we constructed a targeted chimeric virus comprised of recombinant AAV and an fd-tet phage clone displaying the double-cyclic peptide CDCRGDCFC (termed RGD-4C) phage (Pasqualini et al., 1997Pasqualini R.

Med. 1999; 5: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The RGD-4C peptide binds to αv integrins, a cell-surface receptor overexpressed in both tumor and endothelial cells (Arap et al., 1998Arap W. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E.

To obtain chimeric viruses (hereafter referred to as AAV/phage; AAVP), we inserted an eukaryotic gene cassette from AAV in an intergenomic region of RGD-4C phage (RGD-4C AAVP); insertless phage (nontargeted AAVP); or phage displaying control peptides, such as scrambled RGD-4C AAVP or D→E mutant (termed RGE-4C) AAVP, and packaged it with the phage DNA into the phage capsid (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In order to show that the cis-elements of the resulting targeted chimeric virus remain functional, we evaluated the ligand properties of the RGD-4C peptide and the rescuing properties of the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) in the context of AAVP. First, to evaluate peptide specificity, we show that RGD-4C AAVP binds to mammalian cells expressing αv integrins, in contrast to the nontargeted AAVP or AAVP displaying negative control peptides such as RGE-4C or various scrambled versions of the RGD-4C sequence (Figure 1A), which neither bind to nor infect mammalian cells. We also demonstrate that RGD-4C AAVP carrying reporter genes can mediate ligand-directed internalization (Figure 1B) and transduction of mammalian cells (Figure 1C) relative to controls. For cell internalization experiments, negative controls included nontargeted AAVP, various scrambled RGD-4C AAVP, or RGE-4C AAVP (Figure 1B); for cell transduction experiments, nontargeted AAVP (Figure 1C), scrambled RGD-4C AAVP, or RGE-4C AAVP (data not shown) served as negative controls. Consistent with these results, we have previously demonstrated that the synthetic RGD-4C peptide specifically inhibits cell binding and internalization of various targeted RGD-4C phage-based constructs (Giordano et al., 2001Giordano R.J. Cardó-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Biopanning and rapid analysis of selective interactive ligands.Nat. Med. 2001; 11: 1249-1253Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2004Chen L. Zurita A.J. Ardelt P.U. Giordano R.J. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Design and validation of a bifunctional ligand display system for receptor targeting.Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; unpublished data). Finally, we show that mammalian cell transduction can also be specifically competed by the synthetic RGD-4C peptide relative to negative controls such as nontargeted AAVP (Figure 1D), scrambled RGD-4C, or RGE-4C (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that some of these results (Figures 1A and 1B) could represent an artifact resulting from selective failure of the glycine (low pH) wash step to remove AAVP from cell membranes, we performed ice-cold control experiments (Giordano et al., 2001Giordano R.J. Cardó-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Biopanning and rapid analysis of selective interactive ligands.Nat. Med. 2001; 11: 1249-1253Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar), in which we observed cell binding but not internalization mediated by RGD-4C AAVP (data not shown), thus supporting our interpretation. Next, to evaluate whether the ITRs are still functional in the AAVP particle, we performed rescue experiments. We show that functional recombinant AAV particles are generated from mammalian cells transduced with the RGD-4C AAVP only but not from the cells transduced with negative control constructs (Figure 1E). These data establish that the genetic chimerization resulting in an RGD-4C AAVP particle does not fundamentally alter (1) the peptide targeting properties of the ligand-directed RGD-4C phage or (2) the ability to rescue recombinant AAV particles from mammalian cells transduced by RGD-4C AAVP. A side-by-side time course of a reporter transgene expression revealed that RGD-4C AAVP transduction was detectable for much longer compared to that of the RGD-4C phage (Table S1). To gain an insight into the molecular mechanisms of transgene expression mediated by AAVP, we investigated the fate of the transduced genome in mammalian cells. First, we generated stably transduced cell lines by using GFPneo-expressing AAVP to allow for the selection of individual transduced cell clones. Either RGD-4C AAVP-GFPneo or RGD-4C phage-GFPneo lacking AAV ITRs were used to transduce αv integrin-expressing 293 cells, and clones were isolated under G418 selection. Rescue experiments showed functional recombinant AAV-GFPneo generated from all of the RGD-4C AAVP-GFPneo 293 cell clones, but none generated from the RGD-4C phage-GFPneo clones (data not shown), thus confirming that the chimeric individual clones contain functional ITRs. Although cells transduced with the nonchimeric RGD-4C phage-GFPneo retained G418 resistance, GFP expression was generally weaker than that of the RGD-4C AAVP-GFPneo clones (Figure 2A). We then set out to determine the fate of the GFPneo transgene cassette in stably transduced clones by a comprehensive restriction-enzyme digestion of genomic DNA followed by Southern blotting and PCR analysis (Figure 2; Figure S2 and Table S2). To prove persistence of the transgene cassette, genomic DNA was digested with AflII and XhoI to detect the release of full-length transgene cassettes prior to the analysis. We observed such release in 100% of the clones transduced by RGD-4C AAVP (n = 9 of 9 clones), compared to only in 33% of the clones (n = 3 of 9 clones) transduced by the nonchimeric RGD-4C phage construct (Figure 2B). We next designed another restriction digest of genomic DNA to detect potential concatemeric forms of the transgene cassette (Lieber et al., 1999Lieber A. Steinwaerder D.S. Carlson C.A. Kay M.A. Integrating adenovirus-adeno-associated virus hybrid vectors devoid of all viral genes.J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9314-9324PubMed Google Scholar, Hsiao et al., 2001Hsiao C.D. Hsieh F.J. Tsai H.J. Enhanced expression and stable transmission of transgenes flanked by inverted terminal repeats from adeno-associated virus in zebrafish.Dev.

We detected the presence of head-to-tail concatemers of the transgene cassette in 67% of the clones transduced by RGD-4C AAVP (n = 6 of 9 clones), while no such concatemers were detected in clones transduced by the nonchimeric RGD-4C phage construct (Figure 2C). To identify possible additional concatemeric forms of the transgene cassette, we performed a multiplex PCR by using primers flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends of the constructs. Again, we found no concatemers in clones transduced by nonchimeric RGD-4C phage construct, whereas 100% of clones transduced by RGD-4C AAVP contained concatemeric forms (n = 9 of 9 clones), all of them found in head-to-tail orientation (Figure S2B). Moreover, topo cloning of smaller PCR products revealed the head-to-tail orientation of the transgene cassette with ITR deletions (Figure S2C) (Yang et al., 1997Yang C.C. Xiao X. Zhu X. Ansardi D.C. Epstein N.D. Frey M.R. Matera A.G. Samulski R.J. Cellular recombination pathways and viral terminal repeat hairpin structures are sufficient for adeno-associated virus integration in vivo and in vitro.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9231-9247PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, although the large PCR products could not be sequenced, their sizes suggest the presence of concatemers with intact ITRs at the junction site. An individual analysis of DNA for each single clone is also detailed in Table S2. These data suggest that AAVP may bestow an advantage in gene expression by means of an altered fate of the transgene cassette through maintenance of the entire mammalian transgene cassette, better persistence of episomal DNA, formation of concatemers of the transgene cassette, or perhaps a combination of these non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. These observations are consistent with recent developments in the understanding of AAV (McCarty et al., 2004McCarty D.M. Young Jr., S.M. Samulski R.J. Integration of adeno-associated virus (AAV) and recombinant AAV vectors.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 819-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). After demonstrating that the central elements of the targeted chimeric viral particle (i.e., the RGD-4C peptide and the AAV ITRs) are intact and functional and after elucidating the molecular mechanisms of AAVP-mediate gene expression in mammalian cells, we evaluated the specificity and efficacy of gene delivery into tumors after systemic administration of AAVP. As an initial preclinical model, we used nude mice bearing subcutaneous tumor xenografts derived from human Kaposi sarcoma KS1767 cells (Arap et al., 1998Arap W. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. Cancer treatment by targeted drug delivery to tumor vasculature in a mouse model.Science. 1998; 279: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, Ellerby et al., 1999Ellerby H.M. Arap W. Ellerby L.M. Kain R. Andrusiak R. Rio G.D. Krajewski S. Lombardo C.R. Rao R. Ruoslahti E. et al.Anti-cancer activity of targeted pro-apoptotic peptides.Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). First, to verify that the viral construct targets to KS1767-derived xenografts in mice, we intravenously administered either RGD-4C AAVP or one of several negative controls (nontargeted AAVP, scrambled RGD-4C AAVP, or RGE-4C AAVP). After a 3–5 min circulation time, a strong anti-AAVP staining in tumor vasculature was observed in mice that received RGD-4C AAVP but not in control mice (Figure 3A). We next used an RGD-4C AAVP variant encoding the GFP gene as a reporter to determine, by using in situ immunofluorescence microscopic imaging, whether this vector (RGD-4C AAVP-GFP) could transduce KS1767-derived xenografts. We performed immunostaining against GFP in tumors and in different organs 7 days after systemic administration of either RGD-4C AAVP-GFP or negative control constructs into tumor-bearing mice. Immunofluorescence revealed GFP expression largely in tumor blood vessels and surrounding tumor cells in mice that received RGD-4C AAVP-GFP. In contrast, no GFP staining was detected in tumors from control mice that received nontargeted, scrambled, or mutant AAVP-GFP (Figure 3B). This staining pattern suggests that ligand-directed transduction is mediated by targeting of αv integrins in the vascular endothelium of tumors. Consistently, several nontarget control organs (brain, liver, pancreas, and kidney) lacked tissue expression of GFP (Figure S3). These results indicate that RGD-4C AAVP particles can specifically target tumor xenografts by a ligand-directed mechanism and transduce them after systemic administration in vivo. Next, we assessed the efficacy of preclinical bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and clinically applicable molecular-genetic PET imaging with [18F]FEAU for noninvasive monitoring of temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of the firefly luciferase (Luc) and the HSVtk reporter-gene expression, respectively, in living tumor-bearing mice following systemic administration of the RGD-4C AAVP. These molecular-genetic imaging studies were conducted in a preclinical model of human prostate cancer since this particularly prevalent tumor remains a challenge to properly image in patients. We first used a standard experimental setup for in vivo imaging of the Luc transgene reporters in tumor-bearing mice (Figure 4A). We selected BLI of Luc expression because it is a very sensitive method for reporter-gene imaging in mice and has virtually no nonspecific background activity in the images (Gross and Piwnica-Worms, 2005aGross S. Piwnica-Worms D. Spying on cancer: molecular imaging in vivo with genetically encoded reporters.Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 5-15PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, Gelovani Tjuvajev and Blasberg, 2003Gelovani Tjuvajev J. Blasberg R.G. In vivo imaging of molecular-genetic targets for cancer therapy.Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tumor-specific expression of Luc was observed in DU145 tumors in mice receiving RGD-4C AAVP-Luc. In contrast, tumor-associated bioluminescence signals could not be observed in control mice receiving the nontargeted AAVP-Luc or scrambled RGD-4C AAVP-Luc. No bioluminescence was observed in normal organs with any AAVP tested. These data confirm the tumor specificity of RGD-4C AAVP-mediated targeting and transgene expression observed with immunofluorescence microscopy imaging studies with RGD-4C AAVP-GFP. Consistent with previous results presented here (Figure S3), the kinetics of distribution suggests that, despite the nonspecific hepatic clearance of phage particles (Geier et al., 1973Geier M.R. Trigg M.E. Merill C.R. Fate of bacteriophage lambda in non-immune germ-free mice.Nature. 1973; 246: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), such a phenomenon does not result in an undesirable gene transduction of the liver. These observations are in sharp contrast with the well-documented nonspecific transduction of normal organs (such as liver) by the mammalian viral gene delivery vectors. By using BLI in vivo, Luc reporter-transgene expression within tumors was clearly detectable at day 3 after AAVP administration and increased gradually to reach maximal levels by day 10. Repetitive two-dimensional BLI of Luc reporter-gene expression was performed every other day and provided an initial cost-effective strategy to study the specificity, temporal dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity of reporter-transgene expression mediated by AAVP. However, because BLI of Luc reporter-gene expression is not clinically applicable, we next introduced into the AAVP vector the HSVtk gene, which can serve as both a “suicide” gene (when combined with ganciclovir [GCV]) and a reporter transgene for clinically applicable PET imaging with HSVtk-specific radiolabeled nucleoside analogs ([124I]FAIU, [18F]FHBG, [18F]FEAU). Previous studies established that PET imaging of HSVtk expression provides the ability to define the location, magnitude, and duration of transgene expression (Tjuvajev et al., 1998Tjuvajev J.G.

It has also been previously determined that the magnitude of accumulated radiolabeled tracers in HSVtk-transduced cell lines and tumors in vivo correlates with the level of HSVtk expression (Blasberg and Tjuvajev, 2003Blasberg R.G.

Instrumentation aspects of animal PET.Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2005; 7: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the studies presented here, we selected, synthesized, and used the radiolabeled nucleoside analog 2′-[18F]-fluoro-2′-deoxy-1-β-D-arabino-furanosyl-5-ethyl-uracil ([18F]FEAU), which is a better radiolabeled substrate for the HSVtk enzyme than other nucleoside analogs, especially from pharmacokinetic considerations (a very low background activity in all normal organs and tissues) (Kang et al., 2005Kang K.W. Min J.J. Chen X. Gambhir S.S. Comparison of [14C]FMAU, [3H]FEAU, [14C]FIAU, and [3H]PCV for monitoring reporter gene expression of wild type and mutant Herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase in cell culture.Mol. Imaging Biol. 2005; 7: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By using repetitive PET imaging with [18F]FEAU (on days 0, 3, 5, 10, and 16), we have visualized and quantitated the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of HSVtk gene expression after a single systemic administration of RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk or nontargeted AAVP-HSVtk in DU145-derived tumor xenografts and other organs and tissues in nude mice (Figure 4B). Tumor xenograft sizes (∼150 mm3) before, as well as tumor growth rates after, administration of either RGD4C AAVP-HSVtk or nontargeted AAVP-HSVtk were similar in both cohorts of mice (Figure 4C). PET imaging with [18F]FEAU revealed a gradual increase in the level of HSVtk transgene expression in tumors (increase in % administered intravenous dose per gram) during the initial 5 days after administration of RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk, followed by gradual stabilization of HSVtk expression levels toward day 10 post vector administration. In contrast, in control tumor-bearing mice receiving nontargeted AAVP-HSVtk, only a minor increase in tumor accumulation of [18F]FEAU was observed at day 3, which rapidly decreased to background level (Figure 4D). Consistent with preceding BLI experiments, no [18F]FEAU PET-detectable HSVtk expression was observed in nontarget organs or tissues (Figure 4B). Indeed, low-level heterogeneous activity in the PET images (blue color) represents normal background activity, which was intentionally intensified in the images presented to demonstrate that no truncation of low levels of radioactivity was made to artificially “improve” the specificity of HSVtk expression in tumors versus nontarget tissues. When tumors grew to reliably palpable sizes (∼350–400 mm3) and a plateau of HSVtk expression was achieved in tumors, treatment with GCV was initiated in all cohorts of animals (Figure 4C). PET imaging with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) served to monitor glucose metabolism and GCV-induced changes in tumor viability. Two days before initiation of GCV therapy (day 9 post vector administration), the DU145 tumors in both groups of mice were viable and actively accumulated [18F]FDG (Figure 4E). After GCV therapy, the volume of tumors in mice that received RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk was significantly smaller than in mice that received nontargeted AAVP-HSVtk (p < 0.05; Figure 4C). Moreover, tumor xenografts were also metabolically suppressed, as evidenced by a decrease in accumulation of [18F]FDG (Figure 4E). The levels of HSVtk expression in tumors of mice administered with RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk were also significantly decreased after GCV therapy, as evidenced by a sharp decrease in [18F]FEAU accumulation in PET images (Figure 4D), which were obtained 24 hr after the last GCV dose (to avoid competition with FEAU). These studies confirm the specificity of tumor targeting by RGD-4C AAVP and demonstrate that the level of HSVtk transgene expression is adequately high for effective prodrug activation of GCV. In order to evaluate efficacy horizontally in other preclinical models, we assembled a panel of tumor cell lines from different species and histological origins and generated tumors in immunosuppressed or immunocompetent mice. Cohorts of Kaposi sarcoma (KS1767) derived tumor-bearing mice systemically received a single intravenous dose of either the RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk or nontargeted AAVP-HSVtk (control), followed by GCV treatment in all groups. Marked tumor growth suppression was observed in tumor-bearing mice receiving RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk as compared to mice treated with vehicle or mice that received nontargeted AAVP (Figure 5A). Similar tumor growth-suppressive effects were observed in UC3-derived bladder carcinomas (Figure 5B) and DU145-derived prostate carcinomas (Figure 5C) in nude mice, even if larger tumor xenografts were treated (Figure 5D) and consistent with the imaging results presented (Figure 4). To rule out the possibility that the observed antitumor effects were either species specific or xenograft specific, we sought to analyze the efficacy of the RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk on a standard mouse tumor model. We chose an isogenic tumor in which EF43-FGF4 mouse mammary cells are administered subcutaneously to induce rapid growth of highly vascularized tumors in immunocompetent mice (Hajitou et al., 2001Hajitou A. Sounni N.E. Devy L. Grignet-Debrus C. Lewalle J.M. Li H. Deroanne C.F. Lu H. Colige A. Nusgens B.V. et al.Down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2: effect on in vivo mammary tumor growth and angiogenesis.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3450-3457PubMed Google Scholar). First, we established the ligand-directed homing of RGD-4C AAVP to EF43-FGF4-derived tumors by anti-phage immunostaining (Figure S4). Either RGD-4C AAVP-GFP or nontargeted AAVP-GFP was administered intravenously to mice bearing isogenic mammary tumors for a 3–5 min circulation time. Unlike the nontargeted AAVP-GFP, RGD-4C AAVP-GFP produced a strong anti-phage staining in tumors (Figure S4A). Next, we performed immunofluorescence with an anti-GFP antibody at 7 days after intravenous administration to reveal strong GFP expression in the tumors in mice that received RGD-4C AAVP-GFP; in contrast, no GFP staining was detected in tumors from mice that received nontargeted AAVP-GFP; consistently, an anti-αv integrin antibody detected strong expression in EF43-FGF4 tumors (Figure S4B). Again, a single systemic dose of RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk followed by GCV markedly inhibited the growth of EF43-FGF-4 tumors (Figures 5E–5G and Figure 6). Moreover, when tumors grew back after termination of therapy, repeated administrations of RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk again inhibited EF43-FGF4 tumor growth and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice (Figure 5F). Phage-based particles are known to be immunogenic, but this feature can be modulated through targeting itself (Trepel et al., 2001Trepel M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Modulation of the immune response by systemic targeting of antigens to lymph nodes.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8110-8112PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk plus GCV remained surprisingly effective on phage-vaccinated immunocompetent mice despite very high titers of circulating anti-phage IgG (Figure 5G). In selective experiments, a comprehensive panel of negative experimental controls including vehicle alone, vehicle plus GCV, nontargeted AAVP, nontargeted AAVP plus GCV, targeted RGD-4C AAVP, targeted RGD-4C AAVP-GFP, and targeted RGD-4C AAVP-GFP plus GCV (mock transduction) were used (Figure 6A and data not shown). To check for posttreatment effects, we obtained detailed histopathological analysis of EF43-FGF4 tumors recovered 7 days after therapy. We noted extensive tumor destruction caused by the single systemic dose of RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk plus GCV. Specifically, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed uniform destruction of the central area of the tumor and only a small viable outer rim; in contrast, nontargeted AAVP-HSVtk had no such effect (Figure 6B). Staining with an anti-CD31 antibody confirmed both disrupted tumor blood vessels within the tumor central region and preserved vasculature toward the outer rim, whereas no damage was observed in the tumors treated with nontargeted AAVP-HSVtk (Figure 6B). We also evaluated the tumors for terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, which marks apoptotic cells, because the HSVtk/GCV strategy is associated with apoptotic death of cells. In tumors treated with RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk and GCV, TUNEL staining detected apoptosis in the tumor central region but not within the outer rim, while no apoptosis was observed in tumors from mice that received nontargeted AAVP-HSVtk chimera (Figure 6B). Control organs removed from tumor-bearing mice treated by the same experimental protocol revealed no histopathologic abnormalities (Figure S5). Together, these results show that a single systemic dose of RGD-4C AAVP-HSVtk plus GCV maintenance can suppress tumor growth. Some of our results merit further discussion. First, the relative contribution of targeting each tumor compartment (i.e., tumor cells versus tumor vascular endothelium and/or stroma) will depend on the ligand-receptor system and on the experimental model (or models) used. For instance, the expression of the membrane target (i.e., αv integrins) in tumor cells will vary from low (EF43-FGF4) to strong (KS1767). Moreover, aside from the specific optimal dose for transduction of each model (and application) used, there is also an optimal time to examine transgene expression. In other words, the stoichiometry of reporter-gene expression depends not only on levels and patterns of reporter expression in individual cells but also on the relative number of proliferating transgene-expressing cells versus dying transgene-expressing cells. Thus, while we used fixed parameters for the experiments presented here, further determination of targeted AAVP optimal doses and timeframes on a case-by-case basis still apply. Future translational studies will need to be conducted to determine what doses are clinically meaningful and how an AAVP-based system can be optimized for therapy of patients by using clinically applicable molecular-genetic imaging with PET. Finally, one might speculate that a broad range of currently intractable biological questions well beyond molecular oncology will be addressed by using targeted AAVP, especially in combination with different preclinical and clinical molecular-genetic imaging settings. For example, the systemic ligand-directed delivery of constructs with tissue- and/or disease-specific promoters (instead of a CMV promoter) to target sites will allow monitoring expression of their corresponding native genes in vivo; such promoter-driven transcription of reporter activity will allow the study of cell trafficking and engraftment. Several noninvasive imaging applications such as experimental monitoring of substrate-specific degradation, protein-protein interactions, and other molecular events via reporter transactivation, complementation, or reconstitution strategies in cells and in whole animals (Luker et al., 2004Luker K.E.

In fact, we have recently described networks of gold nanoparticles and bacteriophage as biological sensors and cell targeting agents (Souza et al., 2006Souza G.R. Christianson D.R. Staquicini F.I. Ozawa M.G. Snyder E.Y. Sidman R.L. Miller H.L. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Networks of gold nanoparticles and bacteriophage as biological sensors and cell targeting agents.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar); such technology can be combined with ligand-directed AAVP to further improve molecular-genetic imaging. On another note, AAVP itself may provide suitable reagents to study the mechanistic role of ITR structures in transgene persistence and chromosomal integration since (in contrast to AAV vectors) phage-based constructs with no ITRs can serve as negative experimental controls. In translational terms, the results presented here bode well with an existing framework leading to direct AAVP-based random peptide library screening in patients (Arap et al., 2002Arap W. Kolonin M.G. Trepel M. Lahdenranta J. Cardó-Vila M. Giordano R.J. Mintz P.J. Ardelt P.U. Yao V.J. Vidal C.I. et al.Steps toward mapping the human vasculature by phage display.Nat.

Med. 2005; 11: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and may form the basis for the discovery of new or unrecognized human ligand receptors. Thus, many other systemic targeting and imaging applications in tandem will become possible in a relatively short time frame. Ligand-directed AAVP combines desirable properties from two unrelated genetic systems to yield a targeted particle for molecular imaging. Attractive features include a cheap and high yield of production in host bacteria and no requirements for helper viruses or trans-acting factors. Moreover, the native tropism of AAV for mammalian cells is eliminated since there is no AAV capsid formation and the displayed ligand peptides allow homing to tissue-specific receptors. In the prototype presented here, the ligand-directed AAVP sustains no loss of systemic phage targeting properties and even acquires some posttargeting patterns associated with AAV. We have previously proposed that molecular imaging of marker genes would have the potential to assess therapeutic levels of expression and markedly improve our ability to predict response to therapies in which target genes are known. The introduction of ligand-directed AAVP for systemic targeting and molecular-genetic imaging, rationally designed along the lines described here, is a major step in that direction. Finally, one might speculate that (1) in addition to ligand-directed targeting, further platform refinements such as transcriptional targeting will certainly be possible by incorporation of specific promoters and (2) other hybrid viruses containing prokaryotic and eukaryotic elements (such as, for instance, chimeras between adenovirus and double-stranded lambda phage) may also be envisioned for systemically targeted imaging of reporters. Based on this comprehensive analysis, it seems that the translation of our prototype particle may lead to realistic imaging of gene expression in cancer patients. In a larger context, given the favorable tissue-targeting and molecular-imaging profiles, ligand-directed AAVP is likely to be a useful tool in dissecting other relevant biological questions."
https://openalex.org/W2163042763,"Sampling an intact sequence of oceanic crust through lavas, dikes, and gabbros is necessary to advance the understanding of the formation and evolution of crust formed at mid-ocean ridges, but it has been an elusive goal of scientific ocean drilling for decades. Recent drilling in the eastern Pacific Ocean in Hole 1256D reached gabbro within seismic layer 2, 1157 meters into crust formed at a superfast spreading rate. The gabbros are the crystallized melt lenses that formed beneath a mid-ocean ridge. The depth at which gabbro was reached confirms predictions extrapolated from seismic experiments at modern mid-ocean ridges: Melt lenses occur at shallower depths at faster spreading rates. The gabbros intrude metamorphosed sheeted dikes and have compositions similar to the overlying lavas, precluding formation of the cumulate lower oceanic crust from melt lenses so far penetrated by Hole 1256D."

Although enhanced expression of ATX in various tumor tissues has been repeatedly demonstrated, and thus, ATX is implicated in progression of tumor, the precise role of ATX expressed by tumor cells was unclear. In this study, we found that ATX is highly expressed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant glioma due to its high infiltration into the normal brain parenchyma, but not in tissues from other brain tumors.

In addition, knockdown of the ATX level using small interfering RNA technique in SNB-78 cells suppressed their migratory response to LPC.

Cancer. 2004; 109: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATX confers the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of cancer cells. However, there is no direct evidence to show such a hypothesis so far. The mechanism by which ATX exhibits its biological activity toward various cancer cells was unknown. An ATX point mutant that is deficient in 5′-nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity was found to abolish the cell motility-stimulating activity of ATX (13Lee H.Y. Clair T. Mulvaney P.T. Woodhouse E.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24408-24412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), indicating that the migratory response to ATX requires an intact catalytic site. Recently, we and others showed that ATX has lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity, which catalyzes a reaction to produce a bioactive lysophospholipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (14Umezu-Goto M.

ATX has a significantly lower Km for LPC than the Km for the classical nucleotide substrate. Because LPA has long been defined as a cell motility-stimulating factor for various cell types including glioblastomas (16Manning T.J. Parker J.C. Sontheimer H. Cell Motil.

Indeed, recent studies have shown that ATX stimulates the cell motility of various cancer cells in vitro through one of the LPA receptors, LPA1 (19Van Leeuwen F. Olivo C. Grivell S. Giepmans B.N.

Cancer. 2004; 109: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it is possible that certain cancer cells utilize the ATX-LPC-LPA-LPA1 system for their motility. In these cells, a possible regulatory factor that remains to be characterized is LPC. LPC is always present in plasma. In human plasma, its concentration ranges from 100 to 300 μm. LPC is also detected in other biological fluids such as seminal fluids and cerebrospinal fluids and in tissues and various types of cells but at much lower concentrations than in plasma (23Tanaka M. Kishi Y. Takanezawa Y. Kakehi Y. Aoki J. Arai H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Fang X. Gaudette D. Furui T. Mao M. Estrella V. Eder A. Pustilnik T.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumor. Removal of the tumor mass transiently improves the condition of the patient, but the ability of GBM cells to infiltrate normal brain tissue invariably almost always leads to tumor recurrence. Thus, most patients experience recurrence within 1 year (25Fujimaki T. Matsutani M. Nakamura O. Asai A. Funada N. Koike M. Segawa H. Aritake K. Fukushima T. Houjo S. et al.Cancer. 1991; 67: 1629-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and less than 20% of the patients survive more than 2 years (26Fujimaki T. Neurol. Med.-Chir. (Tokyo). 2000; 40: 1-106Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). GBM cells (glioblastomas) are highly motile and invade the normal brain parenchyma diffusely (27Burger P.C. Dubois P.J. Schold S.J. Smith K.J. Odom G.L. Crafts D.C. Giangaspero F. J. Neurosurg. 1983; 58: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Several factors responsible for their invasive phenotype have been reported, such as certain extracellular matrix proteins including laminin, fibronectin, and/or collagen can promote glioma cell migration (28Giese A. Rief M.D. Loo M.A. Berens M.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3897-3904PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hauglan H. Tysnes B. Tysnes O. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 1035-1043PubMed Google Scholar). Secreted matrix metalloproteinases remodel the extracellular matrix, creating pathways more conducive to migration through normal brain tissue (30Westermarck J. Khri V. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Investigations of the factors that affect the motility of glioblastomas are of particular interest because an understanding of these factors is needed for valid GBM therapy. Because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted in GBM tissue, some components in plasma might affect the cell motility of glioblastomas (31Wolff M. Boker D.-K. Clin. Neuropathol. 1999; 8: 72-78Google Scholar, 32Seitz R. Wechsler W. Acta Neuropathol. 1987; 73: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the expression of ATX and LPA1 in brain tumor tissues and various tumor cell lines and found that both ATX and LPA1 are predominantly expressed in glioblastomas and GBM tissue. Using glioblastomas as a model system, we evaluated the effects of ATX, LPA1, LPA, and LPC on the motility of the cells. Reagents—1-oleoyl-LPA (18:1) and 1-oleoyl-LPC (18:1) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Ki16425 was kindly provided by Dr. Hideo Ohata (Kirin Brewery Co., Takasaki, Japan). Cell Lines—All human tumor cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum as described previously (33Yamori T. Matsunaga A. Sato S. Yamazaki K. Komi A. Ishizu K. Mita I. Edatsugi H. Matsuba Y. Takezawa K. Nakanishi O. Kohno H. Nakajima Y. Komatsu H. Andoh T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4042-4049PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lines used in this study were NCl-H23 (lung), NCl-H226 (lung), NCl-H522 (lung), NCl-H460 (lung), A549 (lung), DMS273 (lung), DMS114 (lung), HCC-2998 (colon), HT-29 (colon), WiDr (colon), HCT-15 (colon), DLD1 (colon), SW480 (colon), LOVO (colon), CaRI (rectum), WiDr (colon), CaCo2 (colon), Colo320 (colon), Colo201 (colon), HCT-116 (colon), KM12 (colon), HT1080 (colon), RXF-631L (renal), ACHN (renal), OVCAR3 (ovary), OVCAR4 (ovary), OVCAR5 (ovary), OVCAR8 (ovary), SKOV-3 (ovary), U251 (CNS), SF295 (CNS), SF539 (CNS), SF268 (CNS), SNB75 (CNS), SNB78 (CNS), MKN45 (stomach), MKN28 (stomach), St4 (stomach), MKN1 (stomach), MKN7 (Stomach), MKN74 (stomach), KatoIII (stomach), MKN28 (stomach), MKN45 (stomach), MKN74 (stomach), MDA-MB231 (breast), HBC4(breast), BSY1 (breast), MCF7 (breast), DU145 (prostate), PC3 (prostate), HPC5 (others), A2058 (melanoma), and HeLa (uterine cervix). Mouse 203G glioma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. This cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Koji Adachi (Nippon Medical School Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—From various cancer tissues and cancer cell lines, total RNA from cells was isolated using ISOGEN (Nippongene, Toyama, Japan) and reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were designed using Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in PCR were as follows: ATX (human), forward, 5′-GGGTGAAAGCTGGAACATTCTT-3′; ATX (human), reverse, 5′-GCCACCGCAATATGGAATTATAAG-3′; LPA1 (human), forward, 5′-AATCGGGATACCATGATGAGTCTT-3′; LPA1 (human), reverse, 5′-CCAGGAGTCCAGCAGATGATAAA-3′; LPA2 (human), forward, 5′-CGCTCAGCCTGGTCAAGACT-3′; LPA2 (human), reverse, 5′-TTGCAGGACTCACAGCCTAAAC-3′; LPA3 (human), forward, 5′-AGGACACCCATGAAGCTAATGAA-3′; LPA3 (human), reverse, 5′-GCCGTCGAGGAGCAGAAC-3′; LPA4 (human), forward, 5′-CCTAGTCCTCAGTGGCGGTATT-3′; LPA4 (human), reverse, 5′-CCTTCAAAGCAGGTGGTGGTT-3′; ATX (mouse), forward, 5′-GGAGAATCACACTGGGTAGATGATG-3′; ATX (mouse), reverse, 5′-ACGGAGGGCGGACAAAC-3′; LPA1 (mouse), forward, 5′-GAGGAATCGGGACACCATGAT-3′; LPA1 (mouse), reverse, 5′-ACATCCAGCAATAACAAGACCAATC-3′; LPA2 (mouse), forward, 5′-GACCACACTCAGCCTAGTCAAGAC-3′; LPA2 (mouse), reverse, 5′-CTTACAGTCCAGGCCATCCA-3′; LPA3 (mouse), forward, 5′-GCTCCCATGAAGCTAATGAAGACA-3′; LPA3 (mouse), reverse, 5′-AGGCCGTCCAGCAGCAGA-3′; LPA4 (mouse), forward, 5′-CAGTGCCTCCCTGTTTGTCTTC-3′; LPA4 (mouse), reverse, 5′-GAGAGGGCCAGGTTGGTGAT-3′; GAPDH (human/mouse), forward, 5′-GCCAAGGTCATCCATGACAACT-3′; GAPDH (human/mouse), reverse, 5′-GAGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTT. PCR reactions were performed using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The transcript number of human GAPDH was quantified, and each sample was normalized on the basis of GAPDH content. LysoPLD Assay—Samples were incubated with 2 mm LPC (14:0) in the presence of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100 during indicated hours at 37 °C. The liberated choline was detected by an enzymatic photometric method as described (14Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Briefly, the liberated choline was oxidized by choline oxidase, and the hydrogen peroxide generated was quantified using horseradish peroxidase and TOOS reagent (N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfoproryl)-3-methylanikine, Dojin, Tokyo, Japan). SDS-PAGE/Western Blotting—Both cells and cell media were used to test for ATX protein expression. Cells were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline, and then the cell homogenates were separated into membrane and soluble fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Rad protein transfer system. The membranes were blocked with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 5% (w/v) skimmed milk, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, incubated with anti-lysoPLD monoclonal antibody (3D1) (23Tanaka M. Kishi Y. Takanezawa Y. Kakehi Y. Aoki J. Arai H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and then treated with anti-rat IgG-horseradish peroxidase. Proteins bound to the antibody were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of Stable ATX Transfectant—The plasmid vector pCAGGS (kindly provided by Dr. Junichi Miyazaki (34Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4618) Google Scholar)) was utilized to create rat ATX (ATX-t) tagged with the Myc epitope at the C terminus (pCAGGS-rATX-Myc). To establish stable transfectants, 203G glioma cells were transfected with pCAGGS-rATX-Myc using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer and were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 800 μg/ml G418 (Wako). Individual G418-resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution and screened by immunocytochemistry using Myc antibody and by measuring the lysoPLD activities of the culture media. Recombinant ATX Preparations—Rat ATX was expressed and partially purified using baculovirus system as described previously (14Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The purified ATX was dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline and used for cell motility assays. Boyden Chamber Assay—Chemotaxis was assayed as described previously (21Hama K. Aoki J. Fukaya M. Kishi Y. Sakai T. Suzuki R. Ohta H. Yamori T. Watanabe M. Chun J. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17634-17639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In brief, polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Neuro-Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) were coated with 0.001% fibronectin (Sigma). Cells (1 × 105 cells in 200 μl/well) were loaded into the upper chambers and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h to allow migration. Cell migration to the bottom of the filter was evaluated by measuring optical density at 590 nm. For Ki16425 treatment, cells were preincubated with 1 μm Ki16425 for 30 min. Wound Healing Assay—Cells were plated in cell culture plates (12-well) using cell growth media containing fetal bovine serum. After the cells had reached semiconfluence, fetal bovine serum was removed from the media and replaced with serum-free media. A plastic pipette tip was drawn across the center of the plate to produce a clean wound area 24 h after serum depletion. Medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing different concentrations of 1-oleoyl-LPA, 1-oleoyl-LPC, Ki16425 (1 μm) and lysoPLD. After the cells were cultured for 12, 24, or 36 h, cell movement into the wound area was examined. The migration distances between the leading edge of the migrating cells and the edge of the wound were compared. Quantification of LPC—LPC concentration in cell culture supernatant was determined as described previously (35Kishimoto T. Soda Y. Matsuyama Y. Mizuno K. Clin. Biochem. 2002; 35: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 2 days. LPC was extracted from culture media using the Bligh and Dyer method (51Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. BioChem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. LPC concentration was determined by a recently developed enzymatic colorimetric method as described. Briefly, samples were treated with lysophospholipase, glycerophosphorylcholine, phosphodiesterase, and choline oxidase. The resulting hydrogen peroxide generated was quantified using horseradish peroxidase and TOOS reagent. RNA Interference—SNB-78 glioblastoma cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes 1 day after confluence (day -1) with trans-it TKO (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generally 20 nm siRNA was transfected with 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine per well of a 24-well plate with fresh media. Each experiment contained equivalent samples transfected with a nontargeting control siRNA pool and samples not treated with trans-it TKO. siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes for each gene of interest were purchased from WAKO (Osaka, Japan) as optimized single duplexes (ATX1, sense, 5′-gccguuggagucaauaucuGC-3′, antisense, 5′-agauauugacuccaacggcAA-3′ and ATX2, sense, 5′-gggagacugcuguaccaauTA-3′, antisense, 5′-auugguacagcagucucccCT-3′). Transfection efficiency was monitored using fluorescent (Cy3)-tagged oligonucleotides (Blockit, Invitrogen) transfected as described above and visualized with a mercury lamp fluorescent microscope. Expression of ATX and LPA Receptors in 50 Tumor Cell Lines—We examined the expression of ATX in 50 cultured human tumor cell lines derived from various tumors using the quantitative RT-PCR technique. We found that some cells expressed a significant amount of ATX at both the mRNA and the protein levels (Figs. 1 and 2). High ATX expression was detected in DMS273 (lung cancer), colo320 (colon cancer), SKOV3 (ovarian cancer), MKN1 (stomach cancer), and most of the brain cancer cells (SF295, SF539, SF268, SNB-75, and SNB-78). The expression was highest in SNB-78 cells. In good agreement with this observation, both ATX protein and lysophospholipase D activity were detected in the culture supernatants of these ATX-positive cells (Fig. 2). Most of the protein was detected in the culture cell supernatants, whereas a small amount was detected in cells (Fig. 2A). These results confirm that ATX is secreted from cells, although ATX is initially biosynthesized in cells as a type II membrane protein.FIGURE 2ATX protein and lysoPLD activity in glioblastoma cell lines.

LPC was used as the substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the expression of the LPA receptors (LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, and LPA4) in the 50 human tumor cell lines using quantitative RT-PCR. Although the expression pattern of the four LPA receptors does not necessarily reflect the tissue origin of the tumor cells, restricted LPA receptor expression patterns were obtained (Fig. 1). LPA2 was predominantly expressed in cells from colon, stomach, and breast cancers (36Kitayama J. Shida D. Sako A. Ishikawa M. Hama K. Aoki J. Arai H. Nagawa H. Breast Cancer Res. 2004; 6: R640-R646Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 37Shida D. Watanabe T. Aoki J. Hama K. Kitayama J. Sonoda H. Kishi Y. Yamaguchi H. Sasaki S. Sako A. Konishi T. Arai H. Nagawa H. Lab. Investig. 2004; 84: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). LPA3 expression was relatively low. However, LPA3 was expressed by certain ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines. Expression of LPA4 was fairly low. By contrast, LPA1 was dominant in brain tumor cells (Fig. 2). Expression of ATX and LPA Receptors in GBM—Because SF295, SF539, SF268, SNB-75, and SNB-78 are defined as glioblastomas (gliomas derived from GBM), we attempted to examine the expression of ATX and LPA receptors in tissues from various brain tumors. We found that expression of ATX was markedly high in GBM tissues (Fig. 3). Three of four GBM tissue samples showed extremely high ATX expression. ATX expression is apparently lower in tissues from other brain tumors. One exception is a patient of astrocytoma (case AS2 number 4) whose tissue showed high ATX expression. He experienced early recurrence after only 16 months, and the tumor progressed to GBM at recurrence (case GBM number 1). Among the four LPA receptors, LPA1 was dominantly expressed in most brain tumor tissues tested including GBM with low expression of LPA2, LPA3, and LPA4, which may reflect the expression pattern in normal brain tissues (38An S. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 39Bandoh K. Aoki J. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T.

The expression pattern of ATX and LPA receptors in GBM tissues indicates that ATX contributes to the invasive property of glioblastomas by producing LPA. LPC Stimulates Cell Motility of ATX-expressing Cells—To test the possibility that glioblastomas acquire their high invasiveness through autocrine production of LPA by ATX, we first examined the effect of enhanced ATX expression on cell motility. We used mouse glioma cell line 203G that expressed LPA1 (Fig. 4A) but not a detectable amount of ATX (Fig. 4B). 203G glioma cells that stably express ATX (203G-ATX) were established by transfecting ATX cDNA and by selecting neomycin-resistant clones. The established three lines expressed significant levels of ATX as judged by both lysoPLD activity (data not shown) and Western blotting (Fig. 4B). In addition, these cell lines showed similar expression pattern of LPA receptors to the parental 203G cells (data not shown). The effects of LPA on the motility of transfected cells and mock-transfected 203G cells in the Boyden chamber were similar (Fig. 4C). LPA had a similar effect on the motility of parental 203G cells (not shown). The effect of LPA on the motility of these cells was abolished by the LPA1 antagonist, Ki16425 (Fig. 4C). By contrast, these cells showed quite distinct responses to LPC. LPC significantly stimulated the migration of 203G-ATX cells in Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 4D). However, a similar response was not induced in mock-transfected 203G cells (Fig. 4D) or in parental 203G cells (not shown). In addition, the stimulatory effect of LPC in 203G-ATX cells was completely abolished by the addition of Ki16425 (Fig. 4D), showing that LPA mediates the LPC-stimulated cell migration of the cells through LPA1. We confirmed that platelet-derived growth factor induced similar migratory response in ATX-overexpressing, mock-transfected, and parental 203G cells (data not shown). We further examined the role of endogenously expressed ATX in the cell motility of ATX-expressing cells, which has not been previously demonstrated so far. For this experiment, we used SNB-78, which has the highest ATX expression among the 50 tumor cell lines (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 5A, SNB-78 cells, like other LPA1-positive cells, showed a migratory response to exogenous LPA in the Boyden chamber. LPC also stimulated the migration of SNB-78 (Fig. 5B). Ki16425 blocked not only the LPA-induced migratory response but also the LPC-induced migratory response (Fig. 5). This indicates that: 1) LPC is converted to LPA by the lysoPLD activity of endogenous ATX, 2) the LPA generated subsequently stimulates cell migration through LPA1, and 3) LPC behaves as a chemotactic factor toward ATX-expressing cells. We previously showed that LPC is released from cells and could be converted to LPA to induce cell migration by exogenously added ATX"
https://openalex.org/W2000521278,"G protein βγ subunits have potential as a target for therapeutic treatment of a number of diseases. We performed virtual docking of a small-molecule library to a site on Gβγ subunits that mediates protein interactions. We hypothesized that differential targeting of this surface could allow for selective modulation of Gβγ subunit functions.

Activity of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is required for normal regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation during a diverse array of patterning events, ranging from embryonic segmentation in insects to neural tube differentiation in vertebrates (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980Nusslein-Volhard C.

The Hh pathway also plays a homeostatic role in postembryonic tissues through its regulation of stem cell and precursor cell proliferation, and aberrant activity of the Hh pathway is associated with the initiation and growth of a variety of deadly human cancers (reviewed in Beachy et al., 2004Beachy P.A. Karhadkar S.S. Berman D.M. Tissue repair and stem cell renewal in carcinogenesis.Nature. 2004; 432: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of this signaling pathway in development and disease, however, significant gaps remain in our understanding of Hh signal transduction. The mature Hh ligand is derived from the Hh protein precursor by autoprocessing and lipid modification that generates an amino-terminal signaling peptide (HhN) dually modified by palmitoyl and cholesteryl adducts (reviewed in Mann and Beachy, 2004Mann R.K. Beachy P.A. Novel lipid modification of secreted protein signals.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 891-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Pathway activity is triggered by stoichiometric binding of this dually lipidated Hh ligand to Ptc, a 12-transmembrane transporter-like protein that in the absence of Hh acts catalytically to suppress activity of the seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo). The release of Smo inhibition by HhN binding to Ptc permits activation of an intracellular signal cascade that in turn activates latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, the zinc finger protein Ci (Cubitus interruptus) in Drosophila or the homologous Gli proteins in vertebrates, and these proteins subsequently stimulate transcriptional activation of pathway target genes (reviewed in Lum and Beachy, 2004Lum L. Beachy P.A. The Hedgehog Response Network: Sensors, Switches, and Routers.Science. 2004; 304: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The identification of Ptc as a Hh receptor is based on genetic epistasis studies demonstrating that Ptc functions downstream of Hh (Ingham et al., 1991Ingham P.W. Taylor A.M. Nakano Y.

Biochemical studies have further demonstrated that ShhN, the amino-terminal signaling domain of the mammalian Hh family member Sonic hedgehog, binds with high affinity to mammalian cells expressing murine Patched (mPtch) (Stone et al., 1996Stone D.M.

The signaling potencies of mutationally altered ShhN proteins in this cultured cell-based assay correlate with their apparent mPtch binding affinities (Fuse et al., 1999Fuse N. Maiti T. Wang B.

USA. 1999; 96: 10992-10999Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to its cell-autonomous role in pathway activation, Ptc/HhN binding also results in sequestration and degradation of the HhN protein (Chen and Struhl, 1996Chen Y. Struhl G.

Despite the importance of Ptc/Hh binding in regulating both Hh tissue distribution and cell autonomous response to the Hh signal, it is curious that Ptc protein is mainly localized in vesicular structures within the cytoplasm, with barely detectable levels in the plasma membrane (Capdevila et al., 1994Capdevila J.

The Hh receptor has not been biochemically defined and isolated, and the possibility remains that other pathway components may be involved in Hh binding to target cells. An RNAi-based genome-scale screen (Lum et al., 2003Lum L. Yao S. Mozer B. Rovescalli A. Von Kessler D. Nirenberg M. Beachy P.A. Identification of Hedgehog pathway components by RNAi in Drosophila cultured cells.Science. 2003; 299: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) has recently identified several candidates for such action, including Dally-like (Dlp), a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). A second membrane-associated Hh pathway component, previously known as CG9211 and here referred to as ihog (interference hedgehog), was identified in this RNAi screen (Lum et al., 2003Lum L. Yao S. Mozer B. Rovescalli A. Von Kessler D. Nirenberg M. Beachy P.A. Identification of Hedgehog pathway components by RNAi in Drosophila cultured cells.Science. 2003; 299: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and is the major focus of this work. RNAi targeting of Ihog in cultured cells reveals its requirement for Hh response in cultured cells, and genetic analysis shows that loss of ihog function in embryos and imaginal discs leads to patterning defects associated with loss or reduction of Hh pathway activation. The ihog gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein with four immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and two fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains in its extracellular region. A biochemical interaction between HhN and the Ihog extracellular domain maps to the first FNIII domain (FN1), but signaling function in vivo requires the additional presence of the second FNIII domain (FN2). The binding of HhN to cultured cells is greatly enhanced by coexpression of Ptc and Ihog, and both FN1 and FN2 of Ihog are required to mediate this synergistic effect. A Drosophila homolog and two mammalian homologs can also interact directly with Hh ligands through a specific FNIII domain, suggesting that proteins in this family constitute conserved components of the Hh signal reception machinery. Our previous RNAi-based genome screen that identified CG9211 as a potential novel component of the Hh pathway utilized vector primers to amplify cDNA sequences from a collection of full-length Drosophila cDNA clones (DGCr1) (Stapleton et al., 2002Stapleton M. Liao G. Brokstein P. Hong L. Carninci P. Shiraki T. Hayashizaki Y. Champe M. Pacleb J.

Identification of Hedgehog pathway components by RNAi in Drosophila cultured cells.Science. 2003; 299: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of CG9211 in Hh signalling, we used gene-specific primers to generate dsRNA for testing in our cultured cell assay (Chen et al., 1999Chen C.H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B. Ma Y. Beachy P.A. Nuclear trafficking of Cubitus interruptus in the transcriptional regulation of Hedgehog target gene expression.Cell. 1999; 98: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, Lum et al., 2003Lum L.

Identification of Hedgehog pathway components by RNAi in Drosophila cultured cells.Science. 2003; 299: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In this assay, Hh pathway activity in wing imaginal disc-derived cl-8 cells is indicated by activity of a HhN-sensitive luciferase reporter normalized to a constitutively active control reporter. Consistent with our results in the initial screen, dsRNA produced with CG9211-specific primers reduced response to Hh signaling (Figure 1A), and on the basis of its discovery by RNA interference we have named this gene ihog (interference hedgehog). Transfection of a construct for expression of higher levels of Ihog protein produced only a modest effect on pathway activity (Figure 1A), suggesting that normal Ihog levels in cl–8 cells are only moderately limiting in the response to Hh signaling. RNAi targeting of ihog produced no effect in a cultured cell assay for response to Wg signaling (Lum et al., 2003Lum L. Yao S. Mozer B. Rovescalli A. Von Kessler D. Nirenberg M. Beachy P.A. Identification of Hedgehog pathway components by RNAi in Drosophila cultured cells.Science. 2003; 299: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar and data not shown). We examined the role of the Ihog protein in Hh signaling by epistasis analysis in cultured cells and found that Ihog function was not required for increased basal pathway activity produced either by loss of Cos2 (Figure 1B) or by expression of Smo-Glu (a constitutively active mimic of the Hh-induced, phosphorylated form of Smo; Zhang et al., 2004Zhang C. Williams E.H. Guo Y. Lum L. Beachy P.A. Extensive phosphorylation of Smoothened in Hedgehog pathway activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 17900-17907Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Pathway activation by RNAi-based targeting of the ptc mRNA is complicated by the increased production of ptc mRNA in association with pathway activation; nevertheless, RNAi targeting of ptc partially reversed the loss of Hh response produced by ihog RNAi (Figure 1B), and overexpression of Ptc dramatically suppressed the modest increase in pathway activity produced by Ihog overexpression (Figure 1B). These results, together with in vivo genetic analysis (see below), suggest that Ihog functions upstream or at the level of Ptc. Prior studies showed that Dlp, a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-linked membrane protein, appears to function in Hh signal response at or upstream of the level of Ptc in epistasis studies (Desbordes and Sanson, 2003Desbordes S.C. Sanson B. The glypican Dally-like is required for Hedgehog signalling in the embryonic epidermis of Drosophila.Development. 2003; 130: 6245-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, Lum et al., 2003Lum L. Yao S. Mozer B. Rovescalli A. Von Kessler D. Nirenberg M. Beachy P.A. Identification of Hedgehog pathway components by RNAi in Drosophila cultured cells.Science. 2003; 299: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and that the requirement for Dlp in cultured cells can be circumvented by intracellular expression of Hh (Lum et al., 2003Lum L. Yao S. Mozer B. Rovescalli A. Von Kessler D. Nirenberg M. Beachy P.A. Identification of Hedgehog pathway components by RNAi in Drosophila cultured cells.Science. 2003; 299: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We similarly found that RNAi targeting of ihog did not block signal response with cotransfection of a construct for intracellular Hh expression, although RNAi of smo blocked pathway activity regardless of the source of Hh protein (Figure 1D). We also found that an Ihog expression construct complemented RNAi-mediated loss of Dlp in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1E); the same concentrations of the Ihog expression construct failed to restore Hh response in cells targeted for loss of Smo (Figure 1E). Despite apparent similarities in their action at or upstream of Ptc and their dispensability for cultured cell responses with endogenously expressed Hh protein, Ihog and Dlp functions can be genetically and biochemically distinguished (see below). Complementation of RNAi-mediated Dlp loss provides a valuable assay for functional testing of Ihog protein variants, as RNAi targeting of the short ihog untranslated region (UTR) is not effective. To confirm the role of ihog deduced from RNAi studies in cultured cells, we characterized three mutant ihog alleles and analyzed their effects in embryos and imaginal discs. One of these alleles, ihoge02142, is associated with insertion of a piggyBac transposable element in genomic DNA corresponding to the 5′ UTR of the ihog transcript (Figure 2A). This allele is viable and fertile and only partly disrupts gene function. RT-PCR analysis of RNA from ihoge02142 mutant embryos thus failed to detect RNA containing normal ihog 5′ UTR sequences, but coding RNA sequences were detected, and embryonic protein extracts contained reduced levels of the Ihog protein, as detected with an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of Ihog (Figure 2A, inset). The other two alleles were generated by imprecise excision (see Experimental Procedures) of two distinct P transposable element insertions (EY975 and KG05348) (Figure 2A), both located 3′ of transcribed ihog sequences. Both mutant alleles, ihogEY and ihogKG, delete the original P-element and ∼1kb of sequence in the direction of the ihog gene, and both remove the sequence encoding the transmembrane domain of Ihog, thus likely generating null alleles of ihog. Although both deletions leave intact the sequences on the other side of the insertion site, these mutant alleles probably impair function of CG10158, the gene to the 3′ side of ihog, as the original P-element insertions are located 20 bp upstream of the transcription start site (EY975) and within the 5′ UTR (KG05348) (see Figure 2A) and display homozygous lethality that is fully reverted by precise excision of these P elements (data not shown). The ihoge02142 allele, in contrast, does not affect CG10158. We observed no embryonic cuticle phenotypes in homozygous progeny of flies carrying these mutations. Maternal germ-line clones for either ihogEY or ihogKG, however, produced embryos with denticle belt fusions indistinguishable from those of a hypomorphic hh allele so long as the paternally supplied allele was also mutant (Figure 2Bb' and data not shown); these denticle belt fusions were somewhat less severe with paternal provision of the hypomorphic ihoge02142 allele (Figure 2Bc') as compared to the presumed null alleles ihogEY and ihogKG (Figure 2Bb' and data not shown). Although the CG10158 gene 3′ to ihog likely is damaged in the ihogEY and ihogKG mutant alleles, CG10158 was not identified in our genome-scale screen for components of the Hh pathway, and dsRNAs generated against CG10158 with gene-specific primers did not affect pathway responsiveness when tested in cl-8 cells (Figure S1). Furthermore, the original insertions of these P elements, despite lethality associated with insertion near or within CG10158, did not produce denticle belt fusions in homozygous embryos (data not shown). Most importantly, ihoge02142 does not affect CG10158 yet produces denticle belt fusions when paternally supplied to produce zygotes from homozygous mutant maternal germ-line clones (Figure 2Bc'). These observations together indicate that CG10158 is unlikely to be a component required for Hh signal response and that Hh pathway phenotypes are caused by mutation of ihog. Although homozygous mutant embryos from a heterozygous maternal germ-line did not produce cuticle phenotypes for any of the three ihog alleles analyzed, suggesting a significant maternal contribution of ihog gene products, we did observe denticle belt fusions in embryos doubly mutant for ihog and dlp (Figures 2Bd' and 2Be'). The dlpA187 allele used here is a null allele but, as with ihog mutations, cuticle phenotypes and disruption of segmentation are observed only with loss of both maternal and zygotic function (Han et al., 2004Han C. Belenkaya T.Y. Wang B. Lin X. Drosophila glypicans control the cell-to-cell movement of Hedgehog by a dynamin-independent process.Development. 2004; 131: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Maternal function of both ihog and dlp nevertheless is insufficient to complement their combined zygotic loss. We also examined embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic ihog function and in addition zygotic function of ptc. We found that these embryos showed denticle patterns characteristic of ptc loss (Figure 2C) and not the denticle belt fusions characteristic of ihog or hh loss, thus indicating that ptc function is epistatic to that of ihog, consistent with our epistasis analysis in cultured cells (see above). We produced clones of cells homozygous for ihogKG by FLP-mediated recombination and found that Ptc protein, whose expression is induced by Hh signaling in a narrow stripe of cells on the anterior side of the anterior/posterior compartment boundary, was decreased but not entirely absent within mutant cells along the anterior side of this boundary (Figures 3A and 3B). Anterior compartment clones within the wing pouch also showed loss of expression of Engrailed (En) (Figure 3C), which, during late third instar, normally expands slightly from its territory within the posterior compartment in a manner dependent upon the highest levels of Hh signaling. FLP-mediated recombination also consistently produced a decrease in the extent of the intervein region between L3 and L4 (Figure S2), where Hh signaling is directly responsible for patterning (Mohler et al., 2000Mohler J. Seecoomar M. Agarwal S. Bier E. Hsai J. Activation of knot (kn) specifies the 3–4 intervein region in the Drosophila wing.Development. 2000; 127: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar). These morphological abnormalities together with the reduction of Ptc and En expression in the anterior compartment indicate a role for Ihog in mediating Hh signal response in wing imaginal disc patterning. In contrast, no significant morphological changes were noted in the margin of wings carrying clones lacking ihog function, and no change in the distribution of Wg protein was noted in wing imaginal disc bearing clones lacking ihog function (data not shown). The embryonic and imaginal phenotypes of ihog mutations are somewhat weaker than those of mutations affecting other pathway components such as hh and smo. Of possible relevance, the Drosophila genome contains a related gene, CG32796, here called boi, (brother of ihog). The Ihog and Boi proteins, as well as the related mammalian proteins BOC and CDO (Kang et al., 2002Kang J.S. Mulieri P.J. Hu Y. Taliana L. Krauss R.S. BOC, an Ig superfamily member, associates with CDO to positively regulate myogenic differentiation.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A), contain amino-terminal clusters of four or five immunoglobulin (Ig) domains followed by two or three fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, with a predicted transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal cytotail that displays no apparent homology to other family members or other proteins. The two FNIII domains of the Ihog and Boi proteins are particularly well conserved, with 54% amino acid identity as compared to 42% identity in the Ig domains or 45% identity between the two proteins as a whole (Figure S3), and these domains are most closely related to the second and third FNIII domains of BOC and CDO (not shown). We found that transfection of a Boi expression construct could rescue RNAi-mediated loss of Ihog in cl-8 cells and that Boi, like Ihog, appears to function at or upstream of the level of Ptc (Figure 4B). Boi expression is also capable of rescuing RNAi-mediated loss of dlp function in cl-8 cells (Figure 4C). Ihog protein is detected as a single species of about 100KD in Western blots of lysates from Drosophila embryos (Figure 2A) and from various Drosophila cultured cell lines (data not shown). Ihog is ubiquitously expressed throughout embryogenesis (Figure 4D) and in the wing imaginal disc (not shown). Confirming this distribution, ihog RNA was found by RT-PCR to be expressed in embryos, the wing imaginal disc, and in cl-8 and S2-R+ cultured cells (Figure 4E). We have characterized two isoforms of boi cDNA, one full-length and the other lacking coding sequences for the signal sequence and the Ig domains. The full-length boi transcript, like the ihog transcript, is expressed in embryos, in the wing imaginal disc, and in S2 cells, but in cl-8 cells only the defective RNA is detected (Figure 4E). Given these nearly identical functional properties of Boi and Ihog proteins in cl-8 cultured cells, it seems likely that Boi expression may at least partially compensate for loss of ihog in embryos and imaginal discs and thus account for the intermediate phenotypes of ihog mutations. The relatively strong effect of ihog RNAi in cl-8 cells, where its pathway role was discovered, may be due to the absence of boi expression. Both ihog and boi are expressed in S2 cells, where hyperphosphorylation of Smo provides a rapid and direct readout of Hh pathway activation (Denef et al., 2000Denef N. Neubuser D. Perez L. Cohen S.M. Hedgehog induces opposite changes in turnover and subcellular localization of patched and smoothened.Cell. 2000; 102: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2004Zhang C. Williams E.H. Guo Y. Lum L. Beachy P.A. Extensive phosphorylation of Smoothened in Hedgehog pathway activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 17900-17907Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Combined RNAi against both gene products indeed produced additive effects in this assay (Figure 4F). A similar RNAi-based analysis in embryos was precluded by stability of the Ihog protein (data not shown), and no boi mutation or nearby transposable element for imprecise excision is currently available. Ihog function at or upstream of the level of Ptc suggests a possible role for Ihog as a central or accessory component of the Hh receptor. We further investigated this possibility by examining the subcellular localization of Ihog and by asking whether it can interact with the Hh protein. Consistent with its predicted structure, the Ihog protein appears to be localized mainly to the surface of embryonic cells (Figure 4D) and can be detected on the cell surface in both permeabilized and nonpermeabilized S2-R+ cultured cells (Figure 5A). The Ihog protein likely is modified by glycosylation, as it was enriched by Concanavalin A (Con A) Sepharose chromatography (Figure 5B). Ihog also can be cross-linked to membrane-impermeable biotin (Figure 5C), indicating that it is a cell surface glycoprotein. The levels of Ihog protein in cl-8 cells were not affected by Hh stimulation (Figures 5B and 5C), consistent with its lack of spatial modulation in embryonic and imaginal disc expression. Sequences encoding either the full-length or a truncated series of Ihog proteins were fused at their carboxy-termini to sequences encoding the Fc domain of a human immunoglobulin sequence and immobilized on protein A Sepharose. Fusion proteins containing full-length Ihog coding sequences or the extracellular domain, either in its entirety or lacking the second FNIII repeat, all precipitated HhN from conditioned medium (Figure 5D). A finer resolution analysis revealed that fusion proteins containing only the Ig domains failed to precipitate HhN and that the first FNIII domain alone (FN1), but not the second (FN2), sufficed for interaction with HhN (Figure 5E). The Ihog protein thus specifically interacts with HhN via FN1. As for Ihog, we also found for Boi that FN1 but not FN2 specifically interacts with HhN (Figure 5E). Hh binding by Ihog raises the question of how Ihog may interact with Ptc, a previously characterized Hh receptor (Stone et al., 1996Stone D.M. Hynes M. Armanini M. Swanson T.A. Gu Q.L.J.R. Scott M.P.

https://openalex.org/W2087152593,Methylation marks on the lysine residues of histone proteins are thought to contribute to epigenetic phenomena in part because of their apparent irreversibility. Will this view change with the recent discovery of histone lysine demethylases that reversibly remove methyl marks?
https://openalex.org/W1987097433,Spatial resolution at the atomic scale has been achieved in the coupling of light to single molecules adsorbed on a surface. Electron transfer to a single molecule induced by green to near-infrared light in the junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) exhibited spatially varying probability that is confined within the molecule. The mechanism involves photo-induced resonant tunneling in which a photoexcited electron in the STM tip is transferred to the molecule. The coupling of photons to the tunneling process provides a pathway to explore molecular dynamics with the combined capabilities of lasers and the STM.
https://openalex.org/W1978821926,"TRPV4 is a cation channel that responds to a variety of stimuli including mechanical forces, temperature, and ligand binding. We set out to identify TRPV4-interacting proteins by performing yeast two-hybrid screens, and we isolated with the avian TRPV4 amino terminus the chicken orthologues of mammalian PACSINs 1 and 3. The PACSINs are a protein family consisting of three members that have been implicated in synaptic vesicular membrane trafficking and regulation of dynamin-mediated endocytotic processes. In biochemical interaction assays we found that all three murine PACSIN isoforms can bind to the amino terminus of rodent TRPV4. No member of the PACSIN protein family was able to biochemically interact with TRPV1 and TRPV2. Co-expression of PACSIN 3, but not PACSINs 1 and 2, shifted the ratio of plasma membrane-associated versus cytosolic TRPV4 toward an apparent increase of plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 protein. A similar shift was also observable when we blocked dynamin-mediated endocytotic processes, suggesting that PACSIN 3 specifically affects the endocytosis of TRPV4, thereby modulating the subcellular localization of the ion channel. Mutational analysis shows that the interaction of the two proteins requires both a TRPV4-specific proline-rich domain upstream of the ankyrin repeats of the channel and the carboxyl-terminal Src homology 3 domain of PACSIN 3. Such a functional interaction could be important in cell types that show distribution of both proteins to the same subcellular regions such as renal tubule cells where the proteins are associated with the luminal plasma membrane.

The TRPV4 protein, initially described as OTRPC4 (1Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat.

Genomics. 2001; 4: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), is a member of the TRPV (vanilloid-type transient receptor potential) superfamily consisting of mainly nonspecific cation channels. Like many other transient receptor potential ion channels, TRPV4 contains three ankyrin-like repeat domains in its amino-terminal intracellular domain, six putative transmembrane-spanning domains, a pore loop region, and a transient receptor potential domain near its carboxyl terminus. TRPV4 is activated by exposure to hypotonicity (1Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 2Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), although it has recently been proposed that this activation is mediated by second messengers (5Watanabe H.

Physiol. 2003; 446: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Osmosensation is a form of mechanosensation mediated by ion channels or associated structures that measure tension in membranes or in other elastic elements. In agreement with its proposed function in osmosensation, TRPV4 mRNA transcript is found in epithelial cells of kidney tubules, in the stria vascularis of the cochlea, in sweat glands, and in the osmosensory cells of the circumventricular organs of the brain (1Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 2Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the distribution of TRPV4 protein in other tissues such as airway smooth muscle, oviduct, spleen, heart, liver, testis, keratinocyte, inner ear hair cells, and dorsal root ganglion suggests that the role of this channel is not at all restricted to osmosensation. This notion is supported by reports of a variety of other stimuli that activate TRPV4. For example, increasing the temperature above 27 °C has been found to activate TRPV4 (2Liedtke W. Choe Y.

Likewise, TRPV4 is gated by synthetic agonists such as the phorbol ester 4-α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (8Watanabe H. Vriens J. Suh S.H. Benham C.D. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol.

Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Nature. 2003; 424: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Particularly, the 5′,6′-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid metabolite is a potent activator of TRPV4 (5Watanabe H. Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Nature. 2003; 424: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 10Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The involvement of TRPV4 in sensing a variety of stimuli in vivo was shown by recent studies demonstrating: (i) that TRPV4 is necessary for a circumventricular organ-mediated osmosensation in the CNS (11Liedtke W. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13698-13703Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar); (ii) that thermosensation and nociception is mediated by TRPV4 in mouse skin keratinocytes (12Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21569-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and human mammary keratinocytes (13Gopinath P. Wan E. Holdcroft A. Facer P. Davis J.B. Smith G.D. Bountra C. Anand P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22664-22668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the mechanical/osmotic gating of TRPV4 by cell swelling is dependent on active phospholipase A2, an enzyme necessary for arachidonic acid synthesis (5Watanabe H. Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Nature. 2003; 424: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 10Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). A second messenger-based activation of TRPV4 is consistent with previous electrophysiological findings showing that, by switching from a cell-attached to a cell-detached patch clamp modus, the open probability of TRPV4 substantially decreases (2Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). This phenomenon could also be interpreted as a direct result of the essential requirement of the ion channel for a specific association with intracellular structures. Notwithstanding such penumbral structure-function relation of the TRPV4 gating mechanisms, we hypothesized that TRPV4 interacts with other proteins and that such association may determine the subcellular targeting of TRPV4, its retention in distinct membrane regions, or its withdrawal from the plasma membrane. As a first step toward the identification of interaction partners, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen for TRPV4-binding proteins, and we identified the PACSINs, a group of three proteins, each encoded by an individual gene, as TRPV4-binding partners. We provide evidence that this interaction happens between the carboxyl-terminal SH3 3The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; PRD, proline-rich domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIP, dynamin inhibitory peptide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; 4α-PDD, 4α-phorbol 12,13-dideconate; RT, reverse transcription. domain that is present in all three PACSINs and a triple-proline motif within the amino-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) of TRPV4. Recent studies suggest that PACSIN proteins functionally interact with the endocytotic machinery and participate in synaptic vesicular targeting (18Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that co-expression of PACSIN 3, but not PACSINs 1 and 2, shifts the ratio between intracellular and plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 toward an apparent retention of the protein in or near the plasma membrane. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and Two-hybrid Assays—Two-hybrid bait vectors were generated by PCR from chicken TRPV4 cDNA (accession number NM_204692) (2Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). We used the following primer pairs: the amino-terminal fragment (amino acids 1-453), forward, 5′-gaGAATTCatggcagaccccgaagacccccgtg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gagaGTCGACagcaccgaacttgcgc-3′; first intracellular loop (amino acids 514-539), forward, 5′-gaGAATTCaatatcaaagatctcttcatg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gagaGTCGACtcagtagagcagctgaaatgagcc-3′; second intracellular loop (amino acids 577-606), forward, 5′-gaGAATTCtacttcacgcgagggctcaagc-3′, and reverse, 5′-gagaGTCGACtcagaccaggaggaagcggaacag-3′; and carboxyl-terminal fragment (amino acids 699-852), forward, 5′-gaGAATTCatgctcatcgccctcatgggtg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gagaGTCGACctagagtggggagctgggggtc-3′. Restriction enzyme recognition sites for EcoRI and SalI (indicated in uppercase letters in the primer sequences) were used to subclone the amplified cDNA fragments in frame with the Gal4 binding domain into the yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pBD-GAL4 Cam (Stratagene). The identities and integrity of the cDNA inserts were confirmed by sequencing. For screening, we first transformed yeast strain AH109 (Clontech) with each of the bait vectors, and then we individually transformed each bait-containing yeast cell population with plasmid DNA prepared from a chicken basilar papilla cDNA library in the HybriZAP two-hybrid bacteriophage λ vector (19Heller S. Sheane C.A. Javed Z. Hudspeth A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11400-11405Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Auto-activation in bait-containing yeast cells was suppressed by adding 5 mm of the competitive His3 protein inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to the dropout medium. For each bait, 2 × 107 transformants were selectively screened for Gal4-induced activation of the HIS3 and ADE2 genes by using the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method (20Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). Clones were considered positive when they conferred histidine autotrophy to a deficient yeast strain and when they led to expression of the reporter enzyme β-galactosidase assayed by conversion of colorless 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) to a blue precipitate. Only cDNAs that were isolated multiple times independently were further studied. Positive colonies were further tested for expression of the Gal-4-dependent reporter lacZ by filter lift assay (for details, see HybriZAP-2.1 two-hybrid cDNA synthesis kit manual (Stratagene) and Matchmaker Gal4 Two-Hybrid System 3 user manual (Clontech)). Library cDNA in pAD-GAL4 phagemid vector was recovered from individual yeast colonies via ampicillin selection, and cDNA inserts were sequence-verified. Antibodies—To generate antibodies to TRPV4, the amino terminus of rat TRPV4 (amino acids 1-233) lacking the ankyrin repeats was obtained by PCR with a hexahistidine moiety at its carboxyl terminus and subcloned into the pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant TRPV4 amino terminus was expressed in insect cells (SF9; Invitrogen) and purified under native conditions with Ni2+-conjugated agarose beads (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Qiagen). Two female rabbits were each initially immunized with 200 μg of the recombinant TRPV4 amino terminus; additional boost injections were given at 2-3-week intervals (Covance). The sera of both animals displayed strong reactivity against the immunogen in Western blots. All of the experiments described in this publication were done with the combined final bleed sera of both rabbits and were enriched by affinity purification on a column generated with recombinant TRPV4 amino-terminal protein (Ultralink; Pierce). Antibody specificity was shown by blocking the signal on Western blots via preincubating the anti-TRPV4 polyclonal sera with the amino-terminal TRPV4 polypeptide (Fig. 1A). Another control for antibody specificity was demonstrated by comparing Western blots of kidney and keratinocyte protein extracts from trpv4-null mice and wild-type littermates (11Liedtke W. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13698-13703Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 12Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21569-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We also used previously characterized affinity-purified antibodies to glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of PACSINs 1, 2, and 3 (18Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Plomann M. Lange R. Vopper G. Cremer H. Heinlein U.A. Scheff S. Baldwin S.A. Leitges M. Cramer M. Paulsson M. Barthels D. Eur. J.

Polyclonal anti-TRPV1 and anti-TRPV2 antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The manufacturer demonstrates specificity of these antibodies by blocking the signal on Western blots through preincubation of the antibodies with excess antigen (see manufacturer's product description). 9E10 monoclonal antibody to c-Myc was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and immobilized on agarose beads from a commercial supplier (ProFound c-Myc-Tag immunoprecipitation kit; Pierce). Co-immunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitation, we generated expression vectors for the interaction partners using the plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). We also used the TOPO-pCR8/pTREX Gateway vector systems (Invitrogen) to subclone and express the full-length murine cDNAs of TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV4 proteins. The corresponding primer pairs to amplify these cDNAs were: (i) TRPV1-forward, 5′-aagcttaccatggagaaatgggctagcttaga-3′, and TRPV1-reverse, 5′-tctagatttatttcattatttctcccctggggccatgga-3′; (ii) TRPV2-forward, 5′-gaattcaccatgacttcagcctccaacccc-3′, and TRPV2-reverse, 5′-ctcgagtttatttcattagtgggactggaggacctgaag-3′; and (iii) TRPV4-forward, 5′-aagcttaccatggcagatcctggtgatggtc-3′, and TRPV4-reverse, 5′-tctagatttatttcattacagtggggcatcgtccgtcct-3′. The deletion and point mutations were introduced by PCR, and the resulting amplification products were sub-cloned into the pCDNA3.1 expression vector and sequence-verified. The cell lines HEK293, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 were transfected with single plasmids or with combinations of the expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or polyethylinimine (Polysciences, Inc.). Transfected cells were washed with cold PBS 48 h after transfection and lysed in ice-cold precipitation assay buffer consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 1% octylphenyl-polyethylene glycol (Igepal CA-630), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5. For immunoprecipitation, we used immobilized monoclonal anti-c-Myc agarose beads and performed the experiments according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Alternatively, we added 9E10 monoclonal antibody to c-Myc at a dilution of 1:250 to cell lysates. Following 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, immunoglobulins and bound proteins were precipitated from the lysate with protein A-agarose (Affi-Gel; Bio-Rad), washed four times with precipitation assay buffer, and the bound proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All of the immunoprecipitation-bound proteins were subjected to high stringency washes with 500 mm NaCl in Tris-buffered saline plus 1% Tween 20. Each immunoprecipitation was controlled by mock experiments without the addition of antibody. The omission of the antibody and the use of cell lysates from control-transfected cells always confirmed the specificity of the results presented in this study. Western Blots and Immunocytochemistry—Western blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 2.5% (v/v) Liquid Block (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T). The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antiserum diluted in PBS-T with 2.5% Liquid Block. The following antiserum dilutions were used: 1:5000 for monoclonal 9E10 anti-c-Myc antibody; 1:5000 for rabbit anti-PACSIN 3; 1:10000 rabbit anti-TRPV4; 1:1000 for rabbit anti-mouse TRPV1; and 1:1000 for rabbit anti-mouse TRPV2. The blots were washed four times for 10 min each at room temperature. Detection was performed with IRDye 700- and IRDye 800-conjugated secondary antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) and scanning with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Transfected human cell lines HEK293, HeLa, and mouse NIH 3T3 cells were used for immunofluorescence studies. Kidney tissue was taken from wild-type C57BL/6 mouse (Charles River Labs, MA) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed for cryosections. The cultured cells were fixed with methanol. All of the specimens were blocked in 0.1% Triton-100, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), and 5% (w/v) heat-inactivated goat serum in PBS (PBT1). The slides or cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-TRPV4 (1:500 dilution), rabbit anti-PACSIN 1, 2, or 3 (1:250 dilution), mouse anti-c-Myc (9E10; 1:500), red fluorescent Alexa Fluor 594 wheat germ agglutinin (1:200 dilution, Invitrogen), rabbit anti-mouse TRPV1 (1:250 dilution), and rabbit anti-mouse TRPV2 (1:500). Unbound antibodies were removed by three PBT1 washes and one PBT2 (same formulation as PBT1 but without the serum) wash for 15 min each at room temperature. FITC- and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were diluted 1:1000 in PBT2. TOTO-3 iodide (Invitrogen) was diluted 1:2000. A 2-h incubation period in the secondary antibody mixture preceded three washes for 15 min each in PBS. The coverslipped specimens were analyzed by fluorescence or confocal microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop 2, Leica TCS SP2 or Zeiss LSM Pascal). The dynamin inhibitory peptide (DIP) and the membrane-permeant myristoylated DIP (Tocris Bioscience, Cologne, Germany) were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the transfected cells at a concentration of 100 μm 16 h before fixation and immunostaining. The control cultures were treated with the appropriate amount of Me2SO. For statistical analysis of our quantitative data, we performed unpaired Student's t tests using the Kaleidagraph software (Synergy, Reading, PA). Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were seeded 12-18 h after transfection onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and incubated for 3 h before use. Whole cell currents utilizing ruptured patches were measured with an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Electronic, Lambrecht, Germany; sampling rate, 1 ms; 8-Pole Bessel filter 3kHz). Patch electrodes had a DC resistance of 2-4 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution. An Ag-AgCl wire was used as reference electrode. We used a ramp protocol, starting with a voltage step from 20 to -100 mV followed by a 400-ms linear ramp to +100 mV. This protocol was repeated every 5 s. The cell membrane capacitance values were used to calculate current densities. The standard extracellular solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, buffered at pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). The pipette solution was composed of 20 mm CsCl, 100 mm Asp, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm BAPTA, 2.93 mm CaCl2. The free Ca2+ concentration of this solution was 50 nm. The non-protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, 4α-phorbol 12,13-dideconate (4α-PDD; Sigma), was applied at a 1 μm concentration from a 10 mm stock solution in ethanol. Calcium Imaging—The cells were loaded with Fura-2 by adding 2 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester to the medium for 20 min at 37 °C. For imaging, the cells were perfused with an extracellular solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, buffered at pH 7.4, and 1 μm 4α-PDD was applied for activation. The intracellular [Ca2+]i was measured with an imaging system consisting of a Polychrome IV monochromator (TILL Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) and a Roper Scientific charge-coupled device camera connected to an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Monochromator and camera were controlled with Metafluor software (version 6.3; Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Fluorescence was measured during alternating excitation at 357 and 380 nm and corrected for the individual background fluorescence. The absolute Ca2+ concentration was obtained from the fluorescence ratios using the equation [Ca2+] = Keff(R - R0)/(R1 - R), where Keff, R0, and R1 are calibration constants. R0 and R1 were estimated by perfusing cells with Ca2+-free solution and high Ca2+ containing solution, respectively. The effective binding constant, Keff, was calculated by the equation Keff = Kd(R1 + α)/(R0 + α), where Kd is the dissociation constant of Fura-2, and α is the isocoefficient.

The isocoefficient α was obtained as described by Zhou and Neher (24Zhou Z. Neher E. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues was performed using murine cDNA (mouse multiple tissue cDNA panel B; BD Biosciences) as template with the following oligonucleotides in standard PCRs: (i) PACSIN 3-forward, 5′-ttccgtaaagctcagaagccct-3′, and PACSIN 3-reverse, 5′-tgtcggtacaatgctggtcaga-3′; and (ii) TRPV4-forward, 5′-atcatcctcaccttcgtgctcctg-3′, and TRPV4-reverse, 5′-acaccggacaaatgcctaaatgta-3′. The amplification products were separated in a 1% agarose gel and documented using a digital camera system (Kodak). Identification of PACSINs as TRPV4-binding Partners—We generated four different yeast two-hybrid bait vectors representing Gal4-binding domain fusions with the chicken TRPV4 amino terminus, each of the two intracellular loops and the carboxyl terminus. Only the amino-terminal bait yielded positive clones in yeast two-hybrid screening of a chicken inner ear cDNA library. We identified two groups of clones, all of which represented multiple in-frame isolates of different lengths of the chicken homologues for mammalian PACSINs 1 and 3 (18Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All Three PACSINs Bind to TRPV4—To confirm the yeast two-hybrid screening results, we sought to determine whether the mammalian isoforms of TRPV4 and PACSINs bind each other in biochemical assays. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that all three PACSINs were capable of precipitating co-expressed rat TRPV4 amino terminus (Fig. 1B). Co-expression and immunoprecipitation of the full-length rat TRPV4 as well as murine TRPV4 with all three PACSINs confirmed this observation (Fig. 1, C and D). Neither mouse TRPV1 nor mouse TRPV2 were able to co-precipitate with any of the PACSIN family members, an indication that the binding between PACSINs and TRPV4 is specific (Fig. 1, E and F). PACSIN 3, but Not PACSINs 1 and 2, Increases the Number of Cells Showing Predominant Plasma Membrane Association of TRPV4—Because the PACSINs have been implicated in endocytotic processes, we decided to investigate the subcellular distribution of TRPV4 in the presence of PACSINs. Therefore, we transfected HEK293, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 cells with expression vectors for each protein alone or in combinations. In all of the cell lines used for these studies, we obtained similar results: we noticed that the overall number of cells that displayed pronounced plasma membrane localization of TRPV4 was significantly increased from ∼20-33% to 68-77%, depending on the cell type studied, when PACSIN 3 was co-transfected (77 ± 3.3%, mean ± S.E., n = 3, in HEK293 and 67.5 ± 2.9%, n = 8, in NIH 3T3 cells). Co-transfection with PACSINs 1 and 2 did not alter the number of cells with pronounced localization of TRPV4 in the plasma membrane, which was 20-33% (19.5 ± 1.8%, n = 3, for PACSIN 1 and 30.3 ± 0.3%, n = 4, for PACSIN 2 in HEK293 and 24.2 ± 6.3%, n = 3, for PACSIN 1 and 28.6 ± 2.9%, n = 11, for PACSIN 2 in NIH 3T3 cells) (Fig. 2). Control vector co-expression also did not change the number of cells with pronounced TRPV4 plasma membrane localization (30.2 ± 1.6% in HEK293 and 32.7 ± 4.1% in NIH 3T3 cells). Our co-immunoprecipitation results suggest that neither TRPV1 nor TRPV2 interact with any PACSIN protein. Co-expression of these TRPV family members with PACSINs 2 and 3 revealed no effect on their subcellular distribution (8.9 ± 3.9%, n = 3, for PACSIN 2 and 8.1 ± 1.0%, n = 3, for PACSIN 3 co-expressed with TRPV1; 74.5 ± 1.2%, n = 3, for PACSIN 2 and 70.6 ± 3.8%, n = 4, for PACSIN 3 co-expressed with TRPV2) (Fig. 3), suggesting that the effect of PACSIN 3 is specifically targeting TRPV4 and is not the result of a general inhibition of endocytosis.

The large-scale use of drugs for chemoprophylaxis and treatment will impose strong selection for the evolution of drug-resistant strains. The ensuing transmission of those strains could substantially limit the effectiveness of the drugs as a first-line defense. Summarizing recent data on the rate at which the treatment of influenza infection generates resistance de novo and on the transmission fitness of resistant virus, we discuss possible implications for the epidemiological spread of drug resistance in the context of an established population dynamic model."

We studied the dynamics of replicate laboratory metapopulations of Drosophila under different migration rates. Low migration stabilized metapopulation dynamics, while promoting unstable subpopulation dynamics, by inducing asynchrony among neighboring subpopulations. High migration synchronized subpopulation dynamics, thereby destabilizing the metapopulations. Contrary to some theoretical predictions, increased migration did not affect average population size. Simulations based on a simple non–species-specific population growth model captured most features of the data, which suggests that our results are generalizable."
https://openalex.org/W2066723708,"The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the SARS-associated coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein plays an essential role in SARS-CoV genome packaging and virion assembly. We have previously shown that SARS-CoV N protein forms a dimer in solution through its C-terminal domain. In this study, the crystal structure of the dimerization domain, consisting of residues 270-370, is determined to 1.75A resolution. The structure shows a dimer with extensive interactions between the two subunits, suggesting that the dimeric form of the N protein is the functional unit in vivo. Although lacking significant sequence similarity, the dimerization domain of SARS-CoV N protein has a fold similar to that of the nucleocapsid protein of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. This finding provides structural evidence of the evolutionary link between Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae, suggesting that the N proteins of both viruses have a common origin."

These data demonstrate that, through its interaction with the α3NKA, agrin regulates activity-dependent processes in neurons, providing a molecular framework for agrin action in the CNS. Agrin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, was originally isolated from the electric organs of marine rays based on its ability to induce the formation of high-density clusters of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the surface of cultured muscle cells (Nitkin et al., 1987Nitkin R.M. Smith M.A. Magill C. Fallon J.R. Yao M.Y.-M. Wallace B.G. McMahan U.J. Identification of agrin, a synaptic organizing protein from Torpedo electric organ.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It is present at the earliest nerve-muscle contacts during development (Fallon et al., 1985Fallon J.R. Nitkin R.M. Reist N.E. Wallace B.G. McMahan U.J. Acetylcholine receptor-aggregating factor is similar to molecules concentrated at neuromuscular junctions.Nature. 1985; 315: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and, in mature muscles, is localized to the synaptic basal lamina that lies between the axon terminal and muscle fiber (Reist et al., 1987Reist N.E. Magill C. McMahan U.J. Agrin-like molecules at synaptic sites in normal, denervated, and damaged skeletal muscles.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2457-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Agrin is synthesized by motor neurons and antibodies against agrin block formation of motor neuron-induced clusters of AChR on cultured muscle cells (Reist et al., 1992Reist N.E. Werle M.J. McMahan U.J. Agrin released by motor neurons induces the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions.Neuron. 1992; 8: 865-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When expressed in muscle fibers in vivo, agrin induces formation of ectopic postsynaptic structures (Cohen et al., 1997aCohen I. Rimer M. Lomo T. McMahan U.J. Agrin-induced postsynaptic-like apparatus in skeletal muscle fibers in vivo.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 237-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whereas mutation of the Agrn gene blocks accumulation of AChR at developing neuromuscular junctions (Gautam et al., 1996Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F. Scheller R.H. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Defective neuromuscular synaptogenesis in agrin-deficient mutant mice.Cell. 1996; 85: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Thus, agrin is both sufficient and necessary for differentiation of the postsynaptic apparatus of the neuromuscular junction. Much of what is known about agrin function at the neuromuscular junction has come from studies of the cell surface molecules with which it interacts. For example, a laminin binding domain at agrin's NH2 terminus anchors agrin to the basal lamina (Denzer et al., 1997Denzer A.J. Brandenberger R. Gesemann M. Chiquet M. Ruegg M.A. Agrin binds to the nerve-muscle basal lamina via laminin.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), while binding to α-dystroglycan provides a structural link to the muscle-fiber cytoskeleton that may stabilize the postsynaptic apparatus (Cote et al., 1999Cote P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Chimaeric mice deficient in dystroglycans develop muscular dystrophy and have disrupted myoneural synapses.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It is the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK, however, that is responsible for agrin-induced clustering of AChR. MuSK is concentrated in the postsynaptic muscle-fiber membrane (Valenzuela et al., 1995Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. et al.Receptor tyrosine kinase specific for the skeletal muscle lineage: expression in embryonic muscle, at the neuromuscular junction, and after injury.Neuron. 1995; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and is rapidly phosphorylated in the presence of “active” agrin, which includes either one or two alternatively spliced exons at the z site (z+ agrin), but not the “inactive” isoform, which lacks a z site insert. Inhibition of MuSK phosphorylation blocks agrin-induced AChR clustering (Herbst and Burden, 2000Herbst R. Burden S.J. The juxtamembrane region of MuSK has a critical role in agrin-mediated signaling.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and mice lacking a functional MuSK gene display a phenotype similar to that of the agrin mutant (DeChiara et al., 1996DeChiara T.M. Bowen D.C. Valenzuela D.M. Simmons M.V. Poueymirou W.T. Thomas S. Kinetz E. Compton D.L. Rojas E. Park J.S. et al.The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK is required for neuromuscular junction formation in vivo.Cell. 1996; 85: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that agrin is also important for brain development. It is expressed by all populations of neurons in brain (O'Connor et al., 1994O'Connor L.T. Lauterborn J.C. Gall C.M. Smith M.A. Localization and alternative splicing of agrin mRNA in adult rat brain: transcripts encoding isoforms that aggregate acetylcholine receptors are not restricted to cholinergic regions.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is concentrated at interneuronal synapses (Mann and Kröger, 1996Mann S. Kröger S. Agrin is synthesized by retinal cells and colocalizes with gephyrin.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Hoover et al., 2003Hoover C.L. Hilgenberg L.G.W. Smith M.A. The COOH-terminal domain of agrin signals via a synaptic receptor in CNS neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, the highest levels of agrin expression in developing brain coincide with periods of synapse formation (Cohen et al., 1997bCohen N.A. Kaufmann W.E. Worley P.F. Rupp F. Expression of agrin in the developing and adult rat brain.Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Li et al., 1997Li Z. Massengill J.L. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Agrin gene expression in mouse somatosensory cortical neurons during development in vivo and in cell culture.Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a function analogous to its role at the neuromuscular junction, and, consistent with this hypothesis, synapse formation between cultured hippocampal neurons is disrupted when either agrin expression or function is suppressed (Ferreira, 1999Ferreira A. Abnormal synapse formation in agrin-depleted hippocampal neurons.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4729-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Böse et al., 2000Böse C.M. Qiu D. Bergamaschi A. Gravante B. Bossi M. Villa A. Rupp F. Malgaroli A. Agrin controls synaptic differentiation in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9086-9095PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which agrin exerts its effects in neurons must differ from that at the neuromuscular junction. First, MuSK expression is below detection in mammalian brain (Valenzuela et al., 1995Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. et al.Receptor tyrosine kinase specific for the skeletal muscle lineage: expression in embryonic muscle, at the neuromuscular junction, and after injury.Neuron. 1995; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Second, mutation of the Agrn gene that blocks expression of z+ agrin and disrupts neuromuscular synapse formation has no effect on neuron-neuron synaptogenesis (Li et al., 1999Li Z. Hilgenberg L.G.W. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Formation of functional synaptic connections between cultured cortical neurons from agrin-deficient mice.J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Serpinskaya et al., 1999Serpinskaya A.S. Feng G. Sanes J.R. Craig A.M. Synapse formation by hippocampal neurons from agrin-deficient mice.Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, agrin mutant neurons are resistant to excitotoxic injury, and heterozygous agrin mutant mice are less sensitive to systemic treatment with kainic acid (Hilgenberg et al., 2002Hilgenberg L.G.W. Ho K.D. Lee D. O'Dowd D. Smith M.A. Agrin regulates neuronal responses to excitatory neurotransmitters in vitro and in vivo.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), consistent with agrin regulating some aspect of neuronal activity. Molecular identification of the receptor that mediates agrin's effects in neurons would greatly enhance our understanding of agrin function in the CNS. Evidence that such a receptor exists comes from biochemical studies showing that agrin induces expression of c-fos in cortical and other CNS neurons (Hilgenberg et al., 1999Hilgenberg L.G.W. Hoover C.L. Smith M.A. Evidence of an agrin receptor in cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7384-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, signaling by the neuronal agrin receptor shares some similarity with agrin-induced AChR clustering in muscle, most notably its Ca2+ dependence and sensitivity to inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity. However, in contrast to AChR clustering, where only z+ agrin is active, z+ and z− agrin isoforms are equally potent agonists of the neuronal agrin receptor (Hilgenberg et al., 1999Hilgenberg L.G.W. Hoover C.L. Smith M.A. Evidence of an agrin receptor in cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7384-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hilgenberg and Smith, 2004Hilgenberg L.G. Smith M.A. Agrin signaling in cortical neurons is mediated by a tyrosine kinase-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ that engages both CaMKII and MAPK signal pathways.J. Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), evidence that the neuronal receptor is distinct from MuSK. Activation of the agrin receptor leads to a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+, which serves as the initiating event for many of agrin's effects on neurons (Hilgenberg and Smith, 2004Hilgenberg L.G. Smith M.A. Agrin signaling in cortical neurons is mediated by a tyrosine kinase-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ that engages both CaMKII and MAPK signal pathways.J. Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consistent with a function regulating neuronal activity, recent studies using minimal fragments of agrin as affinity probes have shown that a receptor for agrin is concentrated at synaptic sites (Hoover et al., 2003Hoover C.L. Hilgenberg L.G.W. Smith M.A. The COOH-terminal domain of agrin signals via a synaptic receptor in CNS neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we show that this neuronal agrin receptor is a member of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) family of ion pumps and that agrin binding inhibits pump activity, modulating membrane potential and action potential frequencies of cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and Ca2+ imaging studies have provided evidence for an agrin receptor in cortical and other CNS neurons, distinct from the MuSK/MASC receptor complex responsible for agrin signaling in skeletal muscle (Hilgenberg et al., 1999Hilgenberg L.G.W. Hoover C.L. Smith M.A. Evidence of an agrin receptor in cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7384-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hilgenberg and Smith, 2004Hilgenberg L.G. Smith M.A. Agrin signaling in cortical neurons is mediated by a tyrosine kinase-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ that engages both CaMKII and MAPK signal pathways.J. Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a minimal COOH-terminal region of agrin, C-Ag20, sufficient to activate the neuronal receptor and a smaller fragment, C-Ag15, which acts as an agrin antagonist (Hoover et al., 2003Hoover C.L. Hilgenberg L.G.W. Smith M.A. The COOH-terminal domain of agrin signals via a synaptic receptor in CNS neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As a first step toward identifying the binding site responsible for agrin activity in neurons, we used the membrane-impermeant bifunctional reagent bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3) to chemically crosslink agrin fragments to components present on the surface of cells cultured from cerebral cortex. Cell membranes were then isolated and analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody (9E10.2, Invitrogen) against a COOH-terminal myc tag on the recombinant agrin fragments. Crosslinking C-Ag208 or C-Ag15 to cortical neurons resulted in the appearance of clear anti-myc immunoreactive bands with apparent molecular weights of ∼130 and 125 kDa, respectively, much larger than the expected mass of the agrin fragments (Figure 1A). Agrin neither binds to nor activates nonneuronal cells (Hilgenberg et al., 1999Hilgenberg L.G.W. Hoover C.L. Smith M.A. Evidence of an agrin receptor in cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7384-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hoover et al., 2003Hoover C.L. Hilgenberg L.G.W.

Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, no specific labeling with the myc antibody was observed in blots of nonneuronal cells (Figure 1A). Similar results were obtained with a second crosslinking agent, dimethyl adipimidate (DMA), whose reactive groups are more closely spaced than BS3 (8.6 Å versus 11.4 Å; data not shown). Taking into account the mass of the agrin fragments and assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry, the results suggest that agrin associates with a single class of sites, with an apparent molecular weight of ∼110 kDa, present on neuron cell membranes. Ligand-induced phosphorylation is a common first step in membrane receptor activation, and inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity blocks agrin signaling in CNS neurons (Hilgenberg et al., 1999Hilgenberg L.G.W. Hoover C.L. Smith M.A. Evidence of an agrin receptor in cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7384-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hilgenberg and Smith, 2004Hilgenberg L.G.

Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine whether agrin induces phosphorylation of the putative agrin receptor, membranes from neurons crosslinked to C-Ag208 or C-Ag15, either alone or in combination, were dissolved in a detergent-containing buffer, and aliquots were immunoprecipitated with either an agrin antiserum (Hoover et al., 2003Hoover C.L. Hilgenberg L.G.W. Smith M.A. The COOH-terminal domain of agrin signals via a synaptic receptor in CNS neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb4G10; Upstate). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting for the COOH-terminal myc tag on the agrin fragments. In line with our initial results, anti-agrin immunoprecipitates probed for myc tagged C-Ag208 or C-Ag15 revealed two adducts of the expected molecular weight (Figure 1B). However, only the 130 kDa band crosslinked to C-Ag208 was phosphorylated. Even when used at a 10-fold higher concentration than C-Ag208, C-Ag15 did not induce phosphorylation of the crosslinked complex. C-Ag15 was, however, an effective inhibitor of C-Ag208, blocking both binding and phosphorylation by the larger agrin fragment (Figure 1B), consistent with its ability to antagonize agrin signaling. The properties of the agrin adducts suggest that they represent a complex of an agrin fragment and a receptor that mediates responses to agrin in CNS neurons (Hilgenberg et al., 1999Hilgenberg L.G.W.

Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular identity of this putative agrin receptor, C-Ag208 adducts, crosslinked with either BS3 or DMA, were affinity purified, and the identity of the component proteins was determined by mass spectrometry of their tryptic digests (Proteomic Research Services, Inc.). In addition to the expected peptide sequences for agrin, 4 to 12 peptides were present in each sample that matched the α3 subunit of the NKA. Similar results were also obtained when C-Ag908 (R&D Systems), a larger COOH-terminal fragment more commonly used in studies of agrin function, was used in place of C-Ag208. Combined, the data for the three samples represented 17% coverage of the α3 subunit amino acid sequence overall. To confirm the results of the mass spectrometry, we tested the ability of different NKA α subunit antibodies to recognize the putative agrin-α3NKA complex. When probed with an anti-α3 subunit monoclonal antibody (XVIF9-G10; Novus Biologicals), immunoblots of cultured cortical neurons treated with BS3 alone contained a major 110 kDa band corresponding to the α3 subunit (Figure 2A). Crosslinking in the presence of C-Ag15, C-Ag200, or C-Ag908 resulted in α3-positive bands at 125, 130, and 200 kDa, respectively, consistent with agrin binding to the α3 subunit of the NKA. No molecular-weight shift was apparent when the same cell extracts were probed with an antibody to the closely related α1NKA (9A-5; Sigma), showing that agrin binding is specific for the α3 subunit (Figure 2A). Previous studies have shown that the α3NKA is distributed in a nonuniform fashion over the soma and processes of cultured hippocampal neurons (Juhaszova and Blaustein, 1997Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Na+ pump low and high ouabain affinity alpha subunit isoforms are differently distributed in cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), reminiscent of the pattern of labeling observed using short agrin fragments as histochemical probes for agrin receptors on cultured cortical neurons (Hoover et al., 2003Hoover C.L.

Double labeling with the α3 subunit monoclonal antibody and C-Ag208 revealed extensive overlap between the α3NKA and agrin binding sites on cultured cortical neurons (Figure 2B). Consistent with our earlier studies (Hoover et al., 2003Hoover C.L. Hilgenberg L.G.W. Smith M.A. The COOH-terminal domain of agrin signals via a synaptic receptor in CNS neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), double labeling for synaptophysin and the α3NKA shows agrin receptors diffusely distributed over the neuronal soma but concentrated at synapses (Figure 2C). Together with the results of the biochemical studies, these observations provide strong evidence that the α3NKA is a neuronal receptor for agrin. NKAs are heteromeric proteins composed of α and β subunits. Multiple isoforms of each subunit are encoded by different genes that exhibit cell-specific patterns of expression. Expression of the α3 subunit in the CNS is neuron specific (Kaplan, 2002Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry of Na,K-ATPase.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Neurons but not nonneuronal cells respond to treatment with agrin, suggesting a role for agrin in modulating the function of α3 subunit-containing Na+/K+ pumps. To test this hypothesis, Na+ imaging was used to determine the effect of agrin on cytoplasmic Na+ levels in cultured cortical cells. Treatment with C-Ag208, in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μM), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX; 10 μM), DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV; 50 μM), bicuculline methochloride (BMC; 10 μM), and d-tubocurare (dTbC; 100 μM), to block action potentials and synaptic transmission caused a rapid increase in neuronal cytoplasmic Na+. The response to agrin was reversible and cell specific in that nonneuronal cells were unaffected by the treatment (Figures 3A and 3B). Consistent with its ability to bind but not activate the receptor, C-Ag15 alone had no significant effect on resting Na+ levels but blocked the increase induced by the larger agrin fragments (Figure 3C). Quantitative comparison of the effects of different agrin fragments showed that treatment with either of the alternatively spliced C-Ag20 isoforms or C-Ag908 resulted in a significant increase in neuronal intracellular Na+ (Figure 3D). In contrast, C-Ag15 alone had no effect on resting Na+ levels but blocked the increase normally induced by each of the active agrin fragments. Cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, specifically inhibit NKA activity by binding to determinants present on the extracellular surface of the α subunit (Kaplan, 2002Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry of Na,K-ATPase.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The short latency of the agrin response (t1/2 to peak = 19.7 ± 2.4 s) suggested that agrin might be inhibiting the α3NKA in a similar manner. Supporting this hypothesis, treatment with a low concentration of ouabain to inhibit the high-affinity α3NKA resulted in an increase in neuronal Na+ levels similar to that seen following treatment with active agrin fragments (Figure 3E). Coincubation with C-Ag15 at the same concentration that blocked binding of the active agrin fragments also blocked the ouabain-induced increase in neuronal Na+, providing strong evidence that agrin-induced inhibition of the α3NKA is mediated by binding directly to the α3 subunit. The NKA expels three intracellular Na+ ions for every two K+ ions taken up, directly affecting the membrane potential of all animal cells. In line with the results of the Na+ imaging, whole-cell current-clamp measurements showed that agrin treatment, in the presence of drugs to block action potentials and synaptic transmission, causes a rapid and reversible depolarization of cultured cortical neurons (Figures 3F and 3H). Moreover, C-Ag15 was also effective in blocking depolarization induced by the active agrin fragments (Figures 3G and 3H). Interestingly, treatment with C-Ag15 resulted in a small hyperpolarization (−1.0 ± 0.4 mV, p < 0.05; Figures 3G and 3H), suggesting displacement of endogenous agrin. Consistent with the results of the Na+ imaging, ouabain-induced membrane depolarization was blocked by C-Ag15 (Figure 3I), confirming that agrin's effect on neuron membrane potential is mediated by its interaction with the α3Na+/K+ pump. Studies of MuSK, the receptor in skeletal muscle responsible for agrin-induced clustering of AChR, have shown that agrin-MuSK interaction requires a yet to be identified accessory component expressed only in muscle called MASC (Glass et al., 1996Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattson K. Burden S.J. et al.Agrin acts via a MuSK receptor complex.Cell. 1996; 85: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). To learn whether agrin interaction with the α3NKA might exhibit a similar dependency on cell context, we examined the properties of nonneuronal cells transiently transfected with pRcα3, a plasmid expressing the rat α3 subunit under control of the CMV promoter. Immunostaining with an antibody to the α3NKA showed that nonneuronal cells transfected with pRcα3, but not cells transfected with the enhanced green fluorescent protein marker plasmid pEGFP-C1 alone, expressed the α3 subunit (data not shown). In line with these findings, agrin binding was only observed on the surface membranes of nonneuronal cells expressing pRcα3 (Figure 4A). Immunoblots of agrin fragments crosslinked to nonneuronal cells confirmed the interaction with the α3 subunit expressed from the transfected plasmid (Figure 4B). Thus, expression of the α3 subunit of the NKA is sufficient for agrin binding and is independent of cell context. We next examined the physiological responses of nonneuronal cells transfected with pRcα3 to agrin. Treatment of nonneuronal cells expressing the α3 subunit with either C-Ag20 isoform or C-Ag908 triggered a rapid increase in the concentration of intracellular Na+ ions that was not evident in normal cells or cells transfected with pEGFP-C1 alone (Figures 4C and 4D). Consistent with our earlier results, Na+ levels were unaffected by treatment with C-Ag15 alone, although C-Ag15 proved to be an effective antagonist for the active agrin fragments (Figure 4D). Parallel observations were obtained when whole-cell current-clamp measurements were made to examine the effects of agrin on the electrophysiological properties of nonneuronal cells expressing the α3 construct (Figures 4E and 4F). The mean resting potential of nonneuronal cells was higher and more variable than in neurons. Nevertheless, nonneuronal cells expressing the rat α3NKA subunit were reversibly depolarized (14.1 ± 1.7 mV) by treatment with either of the C-Ag20 fragments. In contrast, no change in the membrane potential was evident upon agrin treatment of nontransfected nonneuronal cells or cells transfected with pEGFP-C1 alone (Figure 4F), indicating that the response to agrin was specific for the pRcα3 construct. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that the α3 subunit of the NKA is the receptor responsible for agrin's effects in cortical neurons. The electrogenic activity of the NKA and its role in maintaining gradients of counter-ions necessary for the function of other transport proteins suggest that changes in α3NKA activity will have profound effects on neuronal function and excitability. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of different agrin fragments on the firing properties of cultured cortical neurons bathed in normal external solution. In line with our earlier observations, neurons were rapidly depolarized by treatment with C-Ag200. However, in the absence of TTX and neurotransmitter receptor antagonists, the agrin-induced depolarization was accompanied by a significant and reversible increase in the frequency of spontaneous action potentials (Figures 5A and 5B). Similar results were also obtained when neurons were exposed to C-Ag208. Coincubation with C-Ag15 blocked both the depolarization and increase in action potential frequency induced by either C-Ag20 isoform (data not shown). The response to exogenously applied agrin prompted us to ask whether the basal level of activity normally present in cultured neurons might be dependent upon endogenous agrin-α3NKA interactions. To address this question, we tested the effects of C-Ag15 on spontaneous action potentials in cultured cortical neurons (Figures 5C and 5D). In contrast to C-Ag"

The integration of p rings into conventional rapid single flux quantum logic as natural two-state devices should alleviate the need for bias current lines, improve device symmetry, and enhance the operation margins."
https://openalex.org/W2068827505,"In brain development, apoptosis is a physiological process that controls the final numbers of neurons. Here, we report that the activity-dependent prevention of apoptosis in juvenile neurons is regulated by kinesin superfamily protein 4 (KIF4), a microtubule-based molecular motor. The C-terminal domain of KIF4 is a module that suppresses the activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a nuclear enzyme known to maintain cell homeostasis by repairing DNA and serving as a transcriptional regulator. When neurons are stimulated by membrane depolarization, calcium signaling mediated by CaMKII induces dissociation of KIF4 from PARP-1, resulting in upregulation of PARP-1 activity, which supports neuron survival. After dissociation from PARP-1, KIF4 enters into the cytoplasm from the nucleus and moves to the distal part of neurites in a microtubule-dependent manner. We suggested that KIF4 controls the activity-dependent survival of postmitotic neurons by regulating PARP-1 activity in brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2013865066,"10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes the NADP+-dependent conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to CO2 and tetrahydrofolate (THF) and is an abundant high affinity folate-binding protein. Although several activities have been ascribed to FDH, its metabolic role in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is not well understood. FDH has been proposed to: 1) inhibit purine biosynthesis by depleting 10-formyl-THF pools, 2) maintain cellular folate concentrations by sequestering THF, 3) deplete the supply of folate-activated one-carbon units, and 4) stimulate the generation of THF-activated one-carbon unit synthesis by channeling folate cofactors to other folate-dependent enzymes. The metabolic functions of FDH were investigated in neuroblastoma, which do not contain detectable levels of FDH. Both low and high FDH expression reduced total cellular folate concentrations by 60%, elevated rates of folate catabolism, and depleted cellular 5-methyl-THF and S-adenosylmethionine levels. Low FDH expression increased the formyl-THF/THF ratio nearly 10-fold, whereas THF accounted for nearly 50% of total folate in neuroblastoma with high FDH expression. FDH expression did not affect the enrichment of exogenous formate into methionine, serine, or purines and did not suppress de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. We conclude that low FDH expression facilitates the incorporation of one-carbon units into the one-carbon pool, whereas high levels of FDH expression deplete the folate-activated one-carbon pool by catalyzing the conversion of 10-formyl-THF to THF. Furthermore, FDH does not increase cellular folate concentrations by sequestering THF in neuroblastoma nor does it inhibit or regulate de novo purine biosynthesis. FDH expression does deplete cellular 5-methyl-THF and S-adenosylmethionine levels indicating that FDH impairs the folate-dependent homocysteine remethylation cycle. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes the NADP+-dependent conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to CO2 and tetrahydrofolate (THF) and is an abundant high affinity folate-binding protein.

Appling D.R. BioFactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar). THF cofactors carry one-carbon units at three oxidation states ranging from formate to methanol (2Wagner C. Folate in Health and Disease. 1995; (Bailey, L. B., ed) pp. , Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York: 23-42Google Scholar). The biologically active THF derivatives contain a reduced pteridine and a polyglutamate peptide consisting of five to eight glutamate residues linked by γ-peptide bonds (3Shane B. Folate in Health and Disease. 1995; (Bailey, L. B., ed) pp. , Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York: 1-22Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is required for the de novo synthesis of purines (supplies the carbon-2 and carbon-8 of the purine ring) and thymidylate (methylation of dUMP to dTMP), and also for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (2Wagner C. Folate in Health and Disease. 1995; (Bailey, L. B., ed) pp. , Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York: 23-42Google Scholar, 3Shane B. Folate in Health and Disease. 1995; (Bailey, L. B., ed) pp. , Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York: 1-22Google Scholar). Methionine can be converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and serve as a methyl donor for numerous methylation reactions, including the methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Serine is a primary source of folate-activated one-carbon units (4Davis S. Stacpoole P. Williamson J. Kick L. Quinlivan E. Coats B. Shane B. Bailey L. Gregory III J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E272-E279Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) catalyzes the THF-dependent aldol cleavage of serine to methylene-THF and glycine. Alternatively, serine can be converted to glycine and formate in the mitochondria through mitochondrial folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (5Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The formate produced in the mitochondria is a major source of one-carbon units for cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism through its conversion to 10-formyl-THF by the enzyme C1-THF synthase (MTHFD1) (6Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Folate deficiency impairs dTMP, methionine, and SAM synthesis, resulting in increased rates of uracil misincorporation into DNA and DNA hypomethylation (5Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Therefore, maintenance of cellular folate concentrations is critical for both DNA synthesis and genome stability and expression. Intracellular folate concentrations are influenced by folate availability, uptake, polyglutamylation, turnover, and export (5Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Folate monoglutamates are transported into the cell either by folate receptors (FRs) or carrier-mediated proteins (7Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Antony A.C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 501-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and then converted to folate polyglutamates by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The addition of the polyglutamate chain is required for cellular retention of folate cofactors (9Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y.J. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271Google Scholar, 10Lin B.-F. Huang R.-F.S. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21674-21679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lin B.-F. Shane B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36811-36817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Reduced folate polyglutamates are sequestered by folate-binding proteins inside the cell that exhibit Kd values in the low micromolar to nanomolar range (13Strong W.B. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9430-9439Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Studies have indicated that the concentration of cellular folate-binding proteins exceeds the concentration of total intracellular folate. In liver, for example, the concentration of folate-binding proteins exceeds the concentration of folate by 5- to 10-fold (5Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13Strong W.B. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9430-9439Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); it has been suggested that the concentration of cellular folate-binding proteins may set the upper limit for intracellular folate accumulation (5Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH; EC 1.5.1.6) is one of the most abundant folate-binding proteins present in liver (14Min H. Shane B. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). FDH catalyzes the NADP+-dependent conversion of 10-formyl-THF to THF and CO2 (1Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. BioFactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice lacking FDH activity are viable and fertile, indicating that one or more FDH functions are not essential in the laboratory environment (16Champion K.M. Cook R.J. Tollaksen S.L. Giometti C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11338-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); FDH may function to regulate the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolic network in specific cell-types. FDH expression is restricted normally to the liver and brain, and its range of tissue-specific expression parallels that of cSHMT (17Girgis S. Nasrallah I.M. Suh J.R. Oppenheim E. Zanetti K.A. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J. Gene. 1998; 210: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Hong M. Lee Y. Kim J.W. Lim J.-S. Chang S.Y. Lee K.S. Paik S.-G. Choe I.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 407-415PubMed Google Scholar), whereas folate-dependent enzymes that catalyze biosynthetic reactions are believed to be expressed more ubiquitously. At least four physiological, and perhaps contradictory, functions have been ascribed to FDH. First, Krebs et al. (19Krebs H.A. Hems R. Tyler B. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) suggested that FDH serves to remove excess one-carbon units from folate metabolism by depleting pools of folate-activated one-carbon units. In support of this hypothesis, mice with a heritable FDH deficiency exhibit 4-fold lower relative hepatic THF concentrations and 2.6-fold higher relative 10-formyl-THF concentrations compared with the livers of control mice (16Champion K.M. Cook R.J. Tollaksen S.L. Giometti C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11338-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, FDH has been suggested to sequester and store cellular folate in the form of THF (2Wagner C. Folate in Health and Disease. 1995; (Bailey, L. B., ed) pp. , Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York: 23-42Google Scholar, 20Fu T.-F. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). FDH purified from rabbit liver contains tightly bound THF polyglutamates (Kd = 15 nm) and its catalytic reaction exhibits product inhibition by THF (21Kim D.W. Huang T. Schirch D. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15772-15783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In mammalian liver, FDH represents between 0.5 and 1.0% of total soluble protein (15Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rabbit liver, the concentration of FDH has been estimated to be 42 μm; intracellular folate concentrations are estimated to be 25–35 μm in liver (22Cichowicz D.J. Shane B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because intracellular FDH concentrations exceed THF concentrations, all cytoplasmic THF is expected to be bound by FDH in vivo (21Kim D.W. Huang T. Schirch D. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15772-15783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mice lacking FDH exhibit a 35% reduction in total folate concentrations despite being maintained on folate sufficient diets, indicating that FDH may help to maintain cellular folate concentrations by sequestering cellular THF (16Champion K.M. Cook R.J. Tollaksen S.L. Giometti C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11338-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Third, FDH has been proposed to inhibit purine biosynthesis by depleting cellular 10-formyl-THF pools (23Krupenko S.A. Oleinik N. Cell Growth Diff. 2002; 13: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, FDH has been suggested to facilitate the generation of folate-activated one-carbons by channeling THF to the enzymes cSHMT and MTHFD1 (21Kim D.W. Huang T. Schirch D. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15772-15783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These two enzymes are the primary entry points for one-carbon units into one-carbon metabolism (Fig. 1). FDH displays product inhibition by THF and contains a second THF-tight-binding site that is distinct from the active site (20Fu T.-F. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Both cSHMT and MTHFD1 suppress THF-mediated product inhibition of FDH and thereby accelerate the catalytic rate of FDH by 2-fold (21Kim D.W. Huang T. Schirch D. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15772-15783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To validate the purported and inferred physiological functions of FDH, the effects of FDH expression on the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolic network and cellular folate concentrations were examined in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, a cell line that does not express detectable levels of the enzyme. Materials—[6S]-[3H]5-Formyl-THF (40 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc., and [methyl-3H]thymidine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [6R,S]-5-Formyl-THF was from SAPEC, the chemical Division of Cerbios-Pharma SA, Barbengo, Switzerland. Fetal bovine serum, α-minimal essential medium (αMEM), and α-modification lacking sodium bicarbonate, folate, ribosides, ribotides, deoxyribosides, and deoxyribotides (defined as αMEM) were obtained from HyClone Laboratories. Folate-depleted fetal bovine serum was prepared by dialyzing serum against ten volumes of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 24 h with buffer changes every 4 h, then charcoal-treated to remove any remaining folate. Cell Lines and Culture Medium—The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line has been described previously (24Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in αMEM with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for all experiments. FDH expression was induced in cell lines by the addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline for a minimum of 4 days prior to experimentation. Generation of Human FDH-expressing Cell Lines—cDNA from a fetal liver library (Clontech) was used as the template to amplify the human FDH open reading frame in two fragments. The first fragment (Fragment A) of the human FDH cDNA (nucleotides 91–1389 from the sequence MN 012190; NCBI) was amplified using the forward primer 5′-CCCTCCTGCTACCATGAAGATT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCCCCCCAATGAAGAGCTGGT-3′. The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 45 s, 51 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for a total of 33 cycles. The second fragment (Fragment B) of the human FDH cDNA (nucleotides 1369–2854) was amplified using the forward primer 5′-TGCCCCACCAGCTCTTGATTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AGGGGCAGGGACTTTCTTCTCAGA-3′. The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for a total of 33 cycles. Fragments A and B were cloned into the pCR vector using the Blunt End TOPO kit (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences of fragments A and B were determined from three different clones and all were identical. This sequence was also identical to the sequence of the human FDH available on the NCBI data base (GenBank™ Accession no. NM 012190). Fragment A was excised from the pCR plasmid with KpnI and XhoI and subcloned into the pKO vector (generating pKO-A). Fragment B was excised from the pCR-B vector with KpnI and XhoI, the fragment gel purified and digested with SapI (which is present in the 1374–1389 nt overlap region of both Fragments A and B). The vector pKO-A was digested with KpnI and SapI, then ligated with Fragment B (containing SapI and KpnI sites), generating the entire human FDH cDNA in the pKO vector. The FDH cDNA was excised from the pKO vector with NotI and EcoRV and subcloned into the pcDNA4/TO/myc-His C vector (Invitrogen) generating pcDNA4-FDH. Stable SH-SY5Y cell lines expressing the human FDH cDNA from the pcDNA6/TR vector (Invitrogen) were generated. SH-SY5Y cells were electroporated with 20 μg of plasmid DNA (pcDNA4-FDH) at 0.22 kV and 950 microfarads (Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser), then cultured with αMEM for 48 h. The medium was replaced with αMEM containing blasticidin (10 μg/ml) and Zeocin (100 μg/ml, Invitrogen) to select for stable integrants. Individual colonies resistant to Zeocin treatment were selected and expanded using αMEM containing blasticidin and Zeocin, and clonal lines expressing human FDH protein were screened by Western blot analyses. Determination of pABG Levels in Culture Medium—Cells were seeded (5.6 × 106) into 100-mm Primaria culture dishes (Falcon) containing 5 ml of αMEM. Following 5-h incubation, the medium was replaced with defined αMEM containing 25 nm [6S]-[5-3H]formyl-THF. Aliquots of medium were taken at various time points, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at –80 °C. Folate degradation products were analyzed in these samples by reversed-phase HPLC as described elsewhere (25Anguera M.C. Suh J.R. Ghandour H. Nasrallah I.M. Selhub J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29856-29862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Samples were spiked with unlabeled pABG, [6R,S]-5-formyl-THF, and [6S]-5-methyl-THF to determine the identity of the radiolabeled fractions. With this method, pABG elutes at 6 min, 5-formyl-THF elutes at 20 min, and 5-methyl-THF elutes at 37 min. For each analysis, 1.0-ml fractions were collected into scintillation tubes, and the tritium was quantified using a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Western Blot Analyses of FDH, GAPDH, and FR—Cells were cultured to 75% confluence in αMEM. Cell pellets were lysed using a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged, and protein concentration of the supernatant was determined. Protein extracts (60 μg/lane) were run on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel (for FDH analysis) or a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (for FR and GAPDH analysis), then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore) using a MiniTransblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). For detection of FDH, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antiserum (1:10,000 dilution) consisting of purified polyclonal antibodies generated in sheep against a highly conserved peptide sequence of human FDH (amino acid residues 390–410). For detection of GAPDH and FR, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution) that recognize the human FR or GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membrane was washed using 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep secondary antibody for the detection of FDH (1:6500 dilution, Pierce), and rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody for the detection of FR and GAPDH (1:7000 dilution, Pierce). Proteins were visualized using the Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). The protein bands were quantified using ChemiImager 4400 from Alpha Innotech Corp. (San Leandro, CA). Cell Growth Assays—The effect of human FDH cDNA expression on SH-SY5Y cell proliferation was determined using a colorimetric MTT (3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. In this assay, the yellow MTT reagent is reduced to an insoluble blue formazan product (λmax = 570 nm) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells. Cells maintained in αMEM were trypsinized and counted in a hemocytometer. Cells were plated in 96-well V-bottom tissue culture plates at 1 × 104 cells/well in either defined MEM (lacking ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, serine, and glycine) or defined MEM with 10 mg/L adenosine and 10 mg/L guanosine. Total volume plated was 100 μl of media, and an additional 50 μl of media was added every 24 h; FDH expression was maintained with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. At given time points (0, 24, 48, and 72 h), 15 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT reagent was added to each well. Cells were incubated 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The insoluble formazan product was pelleted for 10 min at 4000 rpm then resuspended in 100 μl of Me2SO, and A550 was measured on a MRX Microplate Reader (Dynex Technologies). Reported values represent the average and standard deviation of two separate experiments, each with ten replicates. These values were normalized to the lowest A550 value, which was assigned a value of one. Determination of Total Folate Content, SAM, SAH, and Polyglutamate Chain Lengths—Cells were cultured to 70% confluence in αMEM that contained 2 μm folic acid. Total cellular folate, the distribution of folate derivatives, and folate polyglutamate chain lengths were determined by affinity/reversed-phase HPLC as described elsewhere (26Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For SAM and SAH determinations, cells were cultured to 80% confluence in αMEM. 4 h prior to harvest, cells were cultured in αMEM lacking methionine to ensure SAM levels reflected cellular homocysteine remethylation capacity and not exogenous methionine availability. SAM and SAH were extracted from the cells and quantified by HPLC with fluorescence detection relative to standard curves as described elsewhere (27Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Stable Isotope Tracer Studies—To quantify the enrichment of [2,3,3-2H3]serine into purines, thymidine, and methionine, cells were plated at 50% confluence in 100-mm plates and cultured in treatment medium, which consisted of defined αMEM lacking deoxyribonucleosides, hypoxanthine, and thymidine but supplemented with 0.05 μm 5-formyl-THF, 10 μm methionine, 0.2 mm glycine, 1 mg/liter pyridoxine, 250 μm formate, 26 mg/liter l-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine, and 250 μm l-[2,3,3-2H3]serine). To quantify the enrichment of [13C]formate into purines, thymidine, and methionine, cells were plated at 50% confluence in 100-mm plates and cultured in treatment medium, which consisted of defined αMEM lacking deoxyribonucleosides, hypoxanthine, and thymidine but was supplemented with 250 μm [13C]formate, 0.05 μm 5-formyl-THF, 10 μm methionine, 0.2 mm glycine, 1 mg/liter pyridoxine, 26 mg/liter l-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine. Cells were cultured using treatment medium for a total of 8 days, and the medium was replaced every 2 days. Cells were harvested by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then trypsinized and pelleted by centrifugation. Cellular protein and nuclear DNA were isolated as described previously (27Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Protein pellets were suspended in 6 n HCl (100 μl) in vacuum hydrolysis tubes and heated at 100 °C for 20 h. The amino acids were purified by cation exchange chromatography, converted to heptafluorobutyryl n-propyl ester derivatives, and then separated on an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm). Isotopic enrichment was determined in electron capture negative ionization mode by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a model 6890 gas chromatograph and model 5973 mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard Corp., Palo Alto, CA). Selected ion monitoring was conducted at a mass-to-charge ratio m/z 519–523 for serine, m/z 305–308 for dehydroalanine, m/z 349–353 for leucine, m/z 367–370 for methionine, and m/z 293–295 for glycine. DNA samples were dried under nitrogen and suspended in formic acid (1 ml) and hydrolyzed at 150 °C for 45 min in vacuum hydrolysis tubes. After drying at 55 °C under nitrogen, the bases were dissolved in 0.2 ml of a 1:1 mixture of N,O-bis[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide/1% trimethylchlorosilane (Pierce) and acetonitrile and heated at 140 °C for 30 min. The trimethylsilane-base derivatives were separated on an HP-5MS column. Isotopic enrichment was determined in positive ionization mode by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a model 6890 gas chromatograph and model 5973 mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard Corp.). Selected ion monitoring was conducted at a mass-to-charge ratio m/z 255–257 for thymine, m/z 280–283 for adenine, and m/z 368–371 for guanine. Formate Suppression Assay—This assay was developed to quantify the efficiency of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis (as monitored by the incorporation of [14C]formate into purine deoxynucleotides) relative to purine nucleotide biosynthesis through the salvage pathway (as monitored by the incorporation of [3H]hypoxanthine into purine nucleotides). Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium, α modification (HyClone), supplemented with 11% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The tracer medium consisted of Defined Minimal Essential Medium (HyClone) that lacked glycine, serine, methionine, hypoxanthine, and folate but was supplemented with 200 μm methionine, 20 nm 5-formyl-THF, 2 nm [3H]hypoxanthine, and 20 μm [14C]formate. Cells were split 1:6 and grown in 6-well plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in tracer medium until confluent and harvested. The cell pellets were stored at –40 °C. Nuclear DNA was isolated using a DNA Blood Kit from Qiagen, and isotope levels were quantified on a Beckman LS6500 Scintillation Counter in Dual DPM mode. For HPLC separation of nucleosides, cells were split 1:3 into tracer medium in 100-cm2 culture plates, grown to confluence, and harvested. DNA was digested to nucleosides prior to separation by HPLC, using procedures described elsewhere (28Friso S. Choi S.W. Dolnikowski G.G. Selhub J. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4526-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Peaks corresponding to nucleosides were identified from standards, collected, and isotope levels quantified. Cloning of the Human FDH cDNA and Generation of a Tetracycline-inducible Stable Cell Line—A stable SH-SY5Y cell line that expresses the human FDH cDNA from a tetracycline-inducible promoter (pcDNA4/TO/myc-HisB vector, Invitrogen) was isolated (referred to as SH-SY5YFDH). FDH protein was not detected in nontransfected SH-SY5Y cells; SH-SY5YFDH cells cultured in the absence of tet exhibited very low but detectable levels of FDH protein (1.5-fold over densitometry background) (Fig. 2A). SH-SY5YFDH cells cultured with tet (SH-SY5YFDH+tet) exhibited 13.3-fold greater FDH protein levels than present in SH-SY5YFDH cells culture without tet. These cell lines were used to validate the previously ascribed metabolic roles of FDH in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. Specifically, the effects of both low and high level FDH expression on: 1) intracellular folate concentrations, 2) the 10-formyl-THF/THF ratio, 3) SAM levels, and 4) flux within the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolic network were examined. Effect of FDH Expression on Cellular Folate Concentrations—SH-SY5YFDH cells cultured in the absence and presence of tet displayed a 57 and 64% reduction, respectively, in total cellular folate concentrations compared with the parent cell line, SH-SY5Y (Table 1). These results do not support a role fo"
https://openalex.org/W2047081775,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is the most potent activator of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores known today. Although recent reports have suggested an important function of NAADP in human T lymphocytes, direct evidence for receptor-induced formation of NAADP is yet missing in these cells. Thus, we developed a highly sensitive and specific enzyme assay capable of quantifying low fmol amounts of NAADP. In unstimulated T cells, the NAADP concentration amounted to 4.4 ± 1.6 nm (0.055 ± 0.028 pmol/mg of protein). Stimulation of the cells via the T cell receptor/CD3 complex resulted in biphasic elevation kinetics of cellular NAADP levels and was characterized by a bell-shaped concentration-response curve for NAADP. In contrast, the NAADP concentration was elevated neither upon activation of the ADP-ribose/TRPM2 channel Ca2+ signaling system nor by an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration upon thapsigargin stimulation. T cell receptor/CD3 complex-mediated NAADP formation was dependent on the activity of tyrosine kinases because genistein completely blocked NAADP elevation. Thus, we propose a regulated formation of NAADP upon specific stimulation of the T cell receptor/CD3 complex, suggesting a function of NAADP as a Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger during T cell activation.

During a rise of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, Ca2+ either enters the cell from the extracellular space or is released from intracellular stores. The latter process is regulated by an expanding group of intracellular messengers (1Lee H.C. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J.

Nearly a decade later, this contamination was identified as NAADP, which turned out to be the most potent Ca2+-mobilizing compound in sea urchin egg homogenates (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar).

Thus, both a “one pool-one receptor” mechanism (NAADP directly activates RyR) and a “two-pool” mechanism (NAADP releases Ca2+ from a lysosomal store, which than induces Ca2+ release by RyR) may be used by different cell types (for a review, see Ref. 29Galione A. Petersen O.H. Mol. Interv. 2005; 5: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In T lymphocytes an important function of NAADP in the process of Ca2+ signaling induced by stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex has been reported (30Berg I. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, an easy, sensitive, and reliable method to quantify cellular NAADP concentrations would be highly important to analyze a second messenger function in this cell type. In the present study, we describe an improved enzymatic cycling assay for the accurate determination of NAADP, allowing the quantification of low fmol amounts. All enzymes used for this assay are commercially available, and neither sea urchin egg homogenates nor radio-actively labeled NAADP are required. This method was used for the determination of cellular NAADP concentrations in T cells. Upon stimulation of the cells via the TCR/CD3 complex, we found a biphasic elevation of NAADP levels. A bell-shaped concentration-response curve was obtained upon stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex. In contrast, no NAADP elevation was detectable upon stimulation of the ADP-ribose (ADPR)/TRPM2 Ca2+ signaling pathway (31Gasser A. Glassmeier G. Fliegert R. Langhorst M.F. Meinke S. Hein D. Kruger S.

Therefore, we propose a second messenger function of NAADP in T cells. Materials—Resazurin (R2127), ADP-ribosyl cyclase (A8950), diaphorase (D5540), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G8164), NAD glycohydrolase (N9629), nucleotides, and other standard compounds were purchased from Sigma (catalog numbers are in parentheses) or from Roche Applied Science. Trichloroacetic acid, diethyl ether, and trifluoroacetic acid were obtained from Merck, and Q-Sepharose Fast Flow was from GE Healthcare. Charcoal Norit A, obtained from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany), was activated by treatment with 1 m HCl by boiling for 30 min and washed with water until the pH value was neutral. PP2 and genistein were from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. SeralPur water (Seral, Ransbach, Germany) was used during all experiments. Cell Culture—Jurkat T cells (subclone JMP) were cultured as described previously (32Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly the cells were kept in RPMI 1640 medium with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and Glutamax I supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 7.5% (v/v) newborn calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) at a density of 0.3–1.0 × 106 cells/ml. Counting of the cells and determination of the cell volume were performed using a CASY TT 1 system (Schärfe System, Reutlingen, Germany). To quantify cellular protein content, the cells were lysed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, in the presence of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) by incubation for 10 min on ice followed by ultrasonic disruption for 30 s. Thereafter, the protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using BSA as standard. Extraction of Cellular NAADP—1.6 × 108 Jurkat cells were harvested by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min at room temperature), resuspended in 16 ml of buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and kept at room temperature for 40 min. After this incubation, the cell suspension was divided into two identical halves (“twin samples”), and the volume was adjusted to 10 ml with the same buffer as above. The cells in both parts of the twin samples were then stimulated for different periods of time with either different concentrations of OKT3, a vehicle control, 100 μg/ml concanavalin A, or 100 nm thapsigargin. In some experiments, 1 μm PP2 was preincubated with cells for 5 min, or 80 μg/ml genistein was preincubated with cells for 10 min; then the cells were stimulated for 5 min with 5 μg/ml OKT3. After rapid centrifugation (960 × g for 1 min at 10°C), the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid solution (20%, w/v) and lysed using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (five strokes at 1500 rpm). Thereafter the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 37°C two times, cell debris and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation (4400 × g for 10 min), and the supernatants were collected. One of each of a pair of twin samples was spiked by addition of 15 pmol of NAADP to calculate the recovery of the extraction procedure. Then the samples were repeatedly extracted with 5 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether until the pH value was nearly neutral and freeze-dried for 60 min to remove traces of ether. In some experiments artificial samples were used consisting of 0.5 ml of BSA solution (5 mg/ml in water) and 15 pmol of NAADP and/or 375 pmol of purified NADP (see below). These samples were processed in the same way as described for the cell extract samples. Purification of Cell Extracts by Gravity-fed Anion-exchange Chromatography—For the anion-exchange chromatography of neutralized trichloroacetic acid extracts, plastic filtration tubes (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) were packed with 500 μl of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, cleaned in place with 5 ml of 150 mm trifluoroacetic acid, and equilibrated with 15 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. The cell extracts were diluted with 10 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and applied to the columns in aliquots of 1 ml. The columns were then washed with 10 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. For the elution of NAADP, trifluoroacetic acid solutions of increasing concentrations (each 1.5 ml of 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, and 25 mm) were used. The eluate fractions were rapidly diluted with 3.5 ml of ice-cold water and freeze-dried. These samples were stored at –80°C and analyzed as soon as possible. To determine the elution profile of NAADP, artificial samples consisting of BSA with or without 15 pmol of NAADP were extracted as detailed above. In this case, all eluate fractions were separately cleaved with NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) and then analyzed by the cycling assay (see below). As standard procedure the 17.5–25 mm trifluoroacetic acid fractions containing the NAADP were pooled and further processed. Removal of Interfering Compounds by Cleavage with NAD Glycohydrolase—NAADP standards or other compounds were dissolved in 1.5 ml of buffer containing 1 mm Tris/HCl and 2.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3. For the determination of cellular NAADP amounts, the 17.5–25 mm pool of trifluoroacetic acid fractions was used. This sample was reconstituted in 1.5 ml of the same buffer as above. To remove interfering nucleotides, 0.1 unit of the purified NADase was added to the samples. After incubation for 4 h at 37°C, the enzyme was inactivated for 20 min at 95°C, and the samples were cooled on ice and then directly used for the cycling assay. Purification of NADP—NADP was purified by gravity-fed anion-exchange chromatography because commercially available NADP preparations always contain a contamination of NAADP. About 10 μmol of NADP (Roche Applied Science) were dissolved in 20 ml of 1 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and applied to a column of 1 ml of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow that was prepared as detailed above. NADP was then eluted using increasing concentrations of trifluoroacetic acid (4 ml of each 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 mm). The NADP concentration in each fraction was determined by measuring the UV absorption at 260 nm (and initially also by HPLC). After freeze-drying, the purified NADP, which eluted mainly in the 10 mm trifluoroacetic acid fraction, was dissolved at a concentration of 10 mm, and the purity was additionally checked by HPLC. Purification of Enzymes—To purify commercially available NADase, 2.9 mg (1.6 units) of the lyophilized enzyme was dissolved in 320 μl of buffer containing 1 mm Tris/HCl and 2.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0; mixed with 320 μl of BSA solution (5 mg/ml in water) and 640 μl of a suspension (2%, w/v) of activated charcoal in 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0 adjusted with NaOH; and incubated for 30 min at 37°C with vigorous shaking. The charcoal was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was transferred to a Centricon YM-10 device (cutoff, 10 kDa; Millipore). The enzyme solution was concentrated (4400 × g for 20 min at 4°C) to a volume of 150 μl and stored at –20°C. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and diaphorase were purified as follows. 100 μl of each enzyme solution (1 mg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 12 mg/ml diaphorase, both in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0 adjusted with NaOH) were mixed with 200 μl of BSA solution (5 mg/ml in water) and 1.2 ml of a suspension (2%, w/v) of activated charcoal in 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0 adjusted with NaOH. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the charcoal was removed by centrifugation (11,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C), and the supernatant was used directly for the cycling assay. Cycling Assay for NAADP—In the first reaction of the enzymatic cycling assay, NAADP was converted into NADP (see Fig. 1A). Because all measurements were done in triplicate, six wells of a microplate were filled with each 200 μl of the samples, which had been incubated with the NADase before, or with standard NAADP in the same buffer. In some experiments, standard NAADP was incubated with 10 units/ml alkaline phosphatase in the same buffer at 37°C overnight, and the enzyme was subsequently removed using a Centricon YM-10 device (4400 × g for 20 min at 4°C). To three of the wells, 11 μl of a solution containing 0.55 m nicotinamide, 36 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.2, and 9.1 μg/ml ADP-ribosyl cyclase (ADPRC) were added. 11 μl of the same solution containing BSA instead of the enzyme were added to each of the three remaining wells. The microplate was sealed with Parafilm and incubated for 60 min in the dark at room temperature. Then the amplification and indicator reaction (see Fig. 1A) were started by addition of 59 μl of cycling mixture to each well. The cycling mixture contained (all solutions in water except the purified enzymes) 1 μl of 1 m nicotinamide, 20 μl of 500 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0 adjusted with NaOH, 1 μl of 1 mm flavin mononucleotide, 2 μl of 5 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 μl of 10 mm resazurin, 5 μl of 100 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 30 μl of the purified enzymes (see above). Directly after addition of the cycling mixture, the fluorescence (excitation, 544 nm; emission, 590 nm) was measured for each well by a microplate reader (Victor 4120, Wallac, Freiburg, Germany). The microplate was then sealed with Parafilm and incubated for 12 h in the dark at room temperature. The fluorescence was measured again, and the differences between end and start of the reaction were determined for each well. To correct the obtained values for the background due to the presence of NADP or unspecific oxidation of resazurin, each rise in fluorescence in the presence of ADPRC was corrected for the fluorescence increase in the absence of the enzyme (see Fig. 1B). The NAADP content in the samples that were purified by anion-exchange chromatography was obtained by addition of the pooled 17.5–25 mm trifluoroacetic acid fraction. For each pair of twin samples, the recovery was determined by calculating the difference between the halves of the sample with and without spike. Finally the NAADP amount in the twin sample without exogenous NAADP was corrected for the respective recovery. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Loading of Jurkat T cells with Fura2/AM (Molecular Probes) and determination of [Ca2+]i was performed as described previously (32Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Schwarzmann N. Kunerth S. Weber K. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50636-50642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were stimulated with different concentrations of OKT3 or a vehicle control. For the quantification of the increase in [Ca2+]i (see Fig. 3), both the peak and the plateau (500 s after stimulation) were corrected for the basal Ca2+ concentration. Statistical Analysis—For determination of statistical significance, data were tested using a one-way analysis of variance in combination with a Student-Newman-Keuls test. Statistical significance was considered for p < 0.05. The principle of the cycling assay for NAADP is depicted in Fig. 1A. The assay consists of three enzymatic reactions. In the first reaction (Fig. 1A, upper panel), NAADP is converted into NADP using the ADPRC from Aplysia californica. This reaction was conducted at an acidic pH of 4.2 and in the presence of a high excess of nicotinamide, thus reversing the enzymatic formation of NAADP from NADP by ADPRCs (34Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The NADP produced by the ADPRC is then cycled by two enzymatic reactions (Fig. 1A, lower right panel, amplification). In the first reaction, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduces NADP to NADPH, which is then reoxidized to NADP by diaphorase from Clostridium kluyveri. Simultaneously to the reoxidation of NADPH, diaphorase catalyzes the conversion of resazurin into the highly fluorescent resorufin (Fig. 1A, lower left panel, indicator reaction). The major advantage of this kind of cyclic enzyme assay is the strong amplification of the initial signal because the presence of one NADP molecule results in the formation of many molecules of resorufin, thus allowing the detection of minute amounts of NAADP. The first step to establish the assay described above was to adopt the cycling reaction for NADP from the literature (35Stephon R.L. Niedbala R.S. Schray K.J. Heindel N.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 36Wang W. Inoue N. Nakayama T. Ishii M. Kato T. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and to optimize it. For this purpose, the cycling reaction was performed in the presence of NADP without prior conversion of NAADP into NADP (data not shown). A very crucial point was the quality of the enzymes used in the cycling reaction: because the enzymes commercially available were not sufficiently pure (which resulted in a high fluorescence background even in the absence of any substrate in the cycling reaction), both enzymes were purified using activated charcoal in the presence of BSA (see “Experimental Procedures”). After this purification, only a very small increase in the resorufin fluorescence was detected in the absence of NADP (data not shown). The complete conversion of NAADP to NADP by the ADPRC is essential to establish an assay that indirectly quantifies NAADP after conversion into NADP. The ADPRC from A. californica catalyzes the synthesis of NAADP from NADP at an acidic pH and in the presence of high concentrations of nicotinic acid (34Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Different conditions to reverse this reaction were tested and analyzed by HPLC separation of the reaction products (data not shown). At an acidic pH value, the ADPRC converted NAADP into NADP at room temperature, whereas no reaction was observed at 10°C. Besides NADP, which was the main product of the reaction, also small amounts of 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose were generated. Next the formation of NADP from NAADP was coupled to the enzymatic cycling reaction. The reaction conditions of the NAADP formation from NADP were extensively optimized, i.e. different buffers, pH values, concentrations of nicotinamide, amounts of ADPRC, temperatures, and incubation times were tested. The optimal condition to convert NAADP into NADP was an incubation for 60 min at 23°C in the presence of 29 mm nicotinamide, 1.88 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.2, and 0.474 μg/ml ADPRC. After this optimization was completed, a calibration of the cycling assay was performed using different amounts of NAADP standards in the range from 25 to 1000 fmol (data not shown). A linear correlation between NAADP amount and fluorescence increase after 12 h was found (r2 = 0.9996), and the detection limit was 25 fmol at a signal/noise ratio of >3. Another important point to consider is the presence of NADP in cell extracts because NADP would also be detected by the cycling reaction, resulting in a false positive signal. To remove endogenous NADP, both gravity-fed anion-exchange chromatography and an enzymatic digest using an NADase from Neurospora crassa were used. A large portion of NADP was eluted at 10 mm trifluoroacetic acid, whereas NAADP eluted in fractions 17.5–25 mm (Fig. 1E). The remaining contamination of NADP was removed by NADase digest. This enzyme hydrolyzes NAD to ADPR and nicotinamide but is also capable of cleaving NADP into 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. In contrast, NAADP is resistant to NADase treatment (37Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because it was not known whether the enzymatic removal of NADP using the NADase would be complete, we used the following procedure to correct for a possible background of NADP. After the cleavage using the NADase, all samples were incubated either with or without ADPRC in the first reaction of the assay. Then the enzymatic cycling was performed with both types of samples, and the fluorescence increase was quantified after 12 h. Because NAADP cannot be converted into NADP in the absence of the ADPRC, the NADP background was quantified by the reactions without ADPRC. Thus, the fluorescence increase in the presence of ADPRC was corrected for the increase in the absence of the enzyme for each sample. The use of the NADase resulted in a decrease in the sensitivity of the assay. This may be due to a co-precipitation of NAADP with the denatured enzyme during the heat inactivation of the NADase. However, the correlation between the amount of NAADP and the fluorescence increase was still linear as depicted in Fig. 1C. Under these conditions, the detection limit for NAADP was 50 fmol at a signal/noise ratio of >3. Obviously the correction of the fluorescence difference in the presence of ADPRC (Fig. 1B, black bars) for the fluorescence increase in the absence of the enzyme (Fig. 1B, light gray bars) resulted in a complete correction of the background (see blank value in Fig. 1B). Possibly this background in the absence of NADP was due to partial spontaneous oxidation of resazurin. To investigate the specificity of the assay, NAADP was incubated with alkaline phosphatase, leading to the degradation of NAADP to NAAD (Fig. 1D) (37Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, no fluorescence in"

Much research has focused on these functions, because abnormal centrosome duplication may lead to chromosomal instability and then cancer, an idea supported by discovery of supernumerary abnormal centrosomes in different human tumor cells (7Lingle W.L.

In addition to its role in centrosome function, HsCen-2 is found as a stabilizing component of xeroderma pigmentosum complement protein C (XPC) and HRad23B complexes (11Popescu A. Miron S.

The XPC-containing heterotrimer is involved in recognition of DNA lesions and initiation of global genome nucleotide excision repair. Global genome nucleotide excision repair is an important DNA repair pathway for damage caused by UV radiation, carcinogens, and chemotherapeutic agents, and impairment of XPC function is associated with the genetic disorder xeroderma pigmentosum. HsCen-2 appears to promote DNA binding by XPC both in vivo and in vitro and increases the specificity of the heterotrimer for damaged DNA (12Araki M. Masutani C. Takemura M. Uchida A. Sugasawa K.

Centrins are also involved in cilia function (14Keller L.C. Romijn E.P. Zamora I. Yates J.R. III Marshall W.F. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1090-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ca2+-triggered assembly of HsCen-1 and transducin appears to regulate transducin translocation through the connecting cilium of vertebrate photoreceptors (15Giessl A. Pulvermuller A.

Whereas the first centrin, also known as caltractin (Cdc31p), was found in fibers linking the flagellar apparatus to the nuclei of Tetraselmis striata green alga (19Salisbury J.L. Baron A.T. Sanders M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), homologs have since been identified in many organisms, including fungi, plants, and higher eukaryotes. Functional similarities between centrins from various species seem likely. For example, Ca2+-induced contractions of a fiber formed by caltractin and Sfi1p are thought to play a role in microtubule severing in yeast (20Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and a human SfiI homolog binds multiple HsCen-2 molecules (21Salisbury J.L. Curr.

HsCen-2 shares about 50% amino acid identity with human calmodulin. Like calmodulin, the HsCen-2 primary structure contains four EF-hands, a prototypical helix-loop-helix evolved to bind bivalent metals. Most amino acids unique to HsCen-2 from this comparison are highly conserved among centrins across diverse species. An exception is a stretch of 20-25 amino-terminal residues, which are nonconserved among centrins and which are absent in calmodulin and other Ca2+-binding proteins. The carboxyl-terminal sequence 167KKTSLY172, of HsCen-2 is also missing in HsCen-3 and many other centrins of lower eukaryotes lacking centrioles. The aromatic Tyr172 is not found among calmodulins. Despite high sequence similarity, centrins recognize target proteins distinct from those that partner with calmodulins and other EF-hand family members. Little is known about the structural basis of centrin interactions. Some proteins thought to interact with centrins reveal no clear binding site(s) from amino acid analysis, either by visual inspection or by querying a data base of known sequences and properties of calmodulin targets (23Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Residues 847-863 of the human XPC (HsXPC) sequence shown underlined in Fig. 1A, however, were identified as the HsCen-2 binding site after using the calmodulin target data base to suggest sites (11Popescu A.

There is no information on the structure of full-length centrin either alone or in association with other proteins. Structural details of the C-terminal domain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii caltractin and a 19-residue peptide from Kar1p protein, a component of spindle pole bodies required for cell integrity in yeast, have been elucidated using NMR methods (24Hu H. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The formation of this complex is dependent on Ca2+ binding (25Hu H. Sheehan J.H. Chazin W.J. J. Biol.

A calcium-free solution structure of the HsCen-2 N-terminal domain was just published with a closed conformation (27Yang A. Miron S. Duchambon P. Assairi L. Blouquit Y. Craescu C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of HsCen-2 for the XPC-derived peptide is increased 28-fold with saturating calcium present (11Popescu A. Miron S. Blouquit Y. Duchambon P. Christova P. Craescu C.T. J. Biol.

Of note, a XPC mutant that fails to bind HsCen-2 also reduces binding affinity of XPC for DNA and reduces the specificity for repair of DNA damage (13Nishi R. Okuda Y. Watanabe E. Mori T. Iwai S.

Our structure reveals that 1) only the C-terminal domain binds XPC peptide and calcium atoms, 2) the N-terminal lobe exists in a closed conformation with distortions in the loops of its two EF-hands that probably abolish high affinity Ca2+ binding, 3) two XPC peptides bound to separate HsCen-2 molecules interact to form an α-helical coiled-coil conformation, 4) the protein-peptide interface is best characterized as nonpolar, since there are very few hydrogen bonds and only one weak ionic interaction, and 5) the majority of the interface with peptide can be described by analysis of the molecular surfaces surrounding the positions of just three hydrophobic HsXPC residues. General—Research grade reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Protein concentration was determined conventionally by absorbance at 277 nm using an Emm = 1.46 mm-1 cm-1 and after purification by the Bio-Rad (Bradford) method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Native HsCen-2—HsCen-2 was expressed and purified as described earlier (29Craig T.A. Benson L.M. Venyaminov S.Y. Ryan Z.C. Sperry J. Thompson J.R. Salisbury J.L. Bergen H.R. Gross M.L. Kumar R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallization trials were conducted using hanging drop vapor diffusion methods with over 3000 crystallization solutions, which were then optimized for the production of large single crystals. Similar conditions were used for the biosynthesis of selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted HsCen-2 and are reported below. SeMet Human Centrin-2—SeMet-substituted HsCen-2 was synthesized in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) grown in minimal M9 medium inoculated from starter culture at 37 °C as published (30Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). After bacterial cultures attained an A600 of ∼1, methionine biosynthesis was suppressed by the addition of leucine, isoleucine, and valine (50 mg/liter each) and lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine (100 mg/liter each). Selenomethionine was added (25 mg/liter), and protein synthesis was induced 15 min later by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were grown for 12-16 h at 20 °C, collected by centrifugation, and stored frozen at -80 °C some days before further processing. As described for native HsCen-2 (29Craig T.A. Benson L.M. Venyaminov S.Y. Ryan Z.C. Sperry J. Thompson J.R. Salisbury J.L. Bergen H.R. Gross M.L. Kumar R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), the purification involves protease cleavage of a glutathione S-transferase domain fusion. The protein composition and the incorporation of 10 SeMet residues/molecule were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and native gels and also electrospray mass spectrometry analysis. It is to be noted that expression of the glutathione S-transferase-tagged fusion protein results in the addition of 5 extra amino acids (GPLGS) to the amino terminus of the protein following protease treatment of the fusion protein. Peptide Synthesis—The human xeroderma pigmentosa group C peptide (XPC; NWKLLAKGLLIRERLKR), Asn847-Arg863 (11Popescu A. Miron S. Blouquit Y. Duchambon P. Christova P. Craescu C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40252-40261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and solid phase peptide synthesis in the Mayo Proteomics Research Center Peptide Synthesis Facility. The molecular mass of the XPC fragment was verified by microelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Preparation of HsCen-2-XPC Complex—A stock solution of 20 mg/ml SeMet-centrin 2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, was mixed with enough CaCl2 to allow the binding of 2 molofCa2+/mol of protein. Then XPC peptide was added to a 1.3 molar ratio of peptide to protein. The XPC peptide is not completely soluble; complex formation was allowed to take place overnight, at which point precipitate was visible. The pellet consisted of HsCen-2 and XPC peptide. The concentration of the remaining Ca2+-HsCen-2 and XPC peptide complex in solution varied from 6.8 to 12 mg/ml. Crystallization/X-ray Data Collection—The best diffracting crystals resulted from hanging or sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments at 18 or 22 °C. A 2-μl aliquot of SeMet-protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir containing 2.5-3.2 m (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1-0.4 m Na2HPO4. Streak seeding was routinely utilized to produce crystals in a reproducible manner with microplates that were allowed to equilibrate 1-2 days beforehand. To transfer crystalline micronuclei, a cat whisker was used for serial dilutions of broken up crystals. A novel method called microseed matrix screening was used later to obtain large crystals (31Ireton G.C. Stoddard B.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Superior cryoprotection resulted by placing crystals in silicon oil saturated with the crystallization solution prior to flash cooling in liquid N2. Table 1 summarizes the statistics for crystallographic diffraction data collection and structural refinement. The data presented were collected from a flash-cooled crystal (100 K) at beamline X12-C (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParametersValuesLow remoteSelenium peakSelenium edgeSpace groupC21Unit cella = 59.4 Å, b = 59.3 Å, c = 104.7 Å, β = 94.3°Wavelength (Å)0.885600.979800.97952Resolution (Å)40.0 to 2.3540.0 to 2.3540 to 2.35Unique reflections15,09515,16114,999Redundancy1Shown in parenthesis are statistics within 2.39 – 2.35 Å resolution bin6.6 (4.8)6.5 (4.7)6.6 (4.7)Completeness (%)99.3 (96.3)99.3 (96.2)99.2 (95.9)Rsym2Rsym = Σj|Ij – 〈I 〉|/ΣjIj0.082 (0.560)0.097 (0.590)0.082 (0.565)〈I/σI 〉3Average intensity signal-to-noise ratio18.0 (1.74)14.4 (1.64)18.2 (1.66)Figure of merit0.60No. of reflections used14,318Root mean square bond distance0.024No. of atoms2899Root mean square angle2.139R4R = Σ||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo| for observed and calculated structure factors0.192Rfree54% of the reflections were randomly set aside for Rfree calculation0.245a Shown in parenthesis are statistics within 2.39 – 2.35 Å resolution binb Rsym = Σj|Ij – 〈I 〉|/ΣjIjc Average intensity signal-to-noise ratiod R = Σ||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo| for observed and calculated structure factorse 4% of the reflections were randomly set aside for Rfree calculation Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The structure was solved by multiwave-length anomalous dispersion using selenomethionine-labeled protein. Diffraction data collected at three different wavelengths were processed with HKL2000 and SCALEPACK (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) (Table 1). 16 of 20 possible selenium atomic positions were identified by SOLVE (33Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J.

No preexisting atomic coordinates were obligatory for model building. Diffraction data of the low remote wavelength from SeMet-crystals were used during refinement, although native crystals diffracted to 1.3 Å resolution. Native data always contained multiple crystalline lattices, most apparent above 3 Å resolution, despite numerous efforts to overcome the problem. TLS parameters were used to model anisotropic displacements (37Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Structural Description—We determined the crystallographic structure (Table 1) of Ca2+-bound HsCen-2 in complex with the centrin-2 binding peptide derived from human xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein (HsXPC; 847NWKLLAKGLLIRERLKR863) and calcium. The model is refined to 2.35 Å resolution, with R/Rfree values of 0.192 and 0.245, against diffraction data of the low remote wavelength from SeMet-crystals. Fig. 1B shows the rainbow-colored backbone trace of molecule A of HsCen-2 with its HsXPC peptide and two Ca2+ atoms (green spheres) bound to the C-terminal domain. The overall dumbbell-like fold consists of two domains, N-terminal (blue) and C-terminal (red), that do not interact. There is a linker region, shown here as an ordered helix. No interactions are observed between the N-terminal domain of HsCen-2 and the XPC peptide; only residues from the C-terminal domain are involved in XPC binding. The complex contains two Ca2+ atoms bound to EF-hand sites III and IV of the C-terminal domain of HsCen-2. Two complexes are situated within the asymmetric unit as highlighted in Fig. 1C, and no 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry is found relating them. Atomic coordinates exist for residues 23-172 for the subunit designated as molecule A, whereas molecule B includes residues 25-172. Atomic coordinates are found for all residues of both XPC peptides and numbered with regard to human XPC protein (Asn847-Arg863). Only the C-terminal two XPC residues for the peptide bound to molecule A and the last four for that bound to molecule B are supported by any broken electron density. The entire HsXPC peptide is inα-helical conformation. The helical dipole is orientated in the same manner as observed in the binding of the Kar1p peptide to the yeast centrin, caltractin (24Hu H. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both independent complexes of HsCen-2, XPC peptide, and calcium are very similar structurally, as shown by superposition in Fig. 1D. The root mean square deviation is 0.39 Å for 144 Cα atoms. However, there are minor differences found at the two peptide binding sites, which appear due to intermolecular interactions between both HsXPC peptides. HsXPC Peptides Form Helical Coiled-coil—There are no direct interactions between the C-terminal domains for the two HsCen-2 subunits in Fig. 1C. Rather the crystal forms in part from hydrophobic interactions between the two XPC peptides. The most significant XPC residues involved in the interaction, based on buried surface area, are Leu850, Ile857, and Leu861. The interface also requires a small side chain like the glycine found at position 854 for complete interdigitation of these hydrophobic side chains. Burial of aliphatic carbons from Lys853, Arg858, and Lys862 play a smaller role. The overall conformation of the XPC peptides taken together is that of an α-helical coiled-coil with a parallel orientation of both helical dipoles. HsCen-2 Interactions with XPC—The buried surfaces at the interface of HsCen-2 and XPC peptide are extensively hydrophobic, and the packing provides for substantial van der Waals interactions. Calculations using the Lee and Richards algorithm (42Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar) reveal roughly 732 Å2 of the solvent-accessible surface area of HsCen-2 is buried at the interface with XPC peptide; for the peptide, the value is 1020 Å2. The molecular surface of HsCen-2 at this interface is a highly curved 23 × 22-Å area formed by 30% polar atoms and 70% nonpolar atoms. The complementary surface of the XPC peptide measures 21 × 15 Å, created by 24% polar and 76% nonpolar atoms. Hydrogen bonds play only a small role between 8 and 10 amino acids. The most surprising result was the lack of electrostatic interactions given the basic nature of the HsXPC peptide. Only one ionic interaction, a weak salt bridge, was identified between Arg858 and HsCen-2 Glu132. No bridging solvent molecules mediate peptide binding. Once more, nonpolar interactions predominate. Shown in Fig. 2A is an α-helix portrayal of the XPC peptide backbone, labeled by amino acid. The most significant interfacial peptide residues, in order of their nonpolar occluded surface, are Trp848, Lys849 molecule A, Leu851, Leu855, Leu856, and Lys849 molecule B. The high amino acid conservation of these specific XPC residues points to their importance in formation of the binding site. Fig. 2B shows a frequency histogram of a multiple sequence alignment that encompasses the XPC HsCen-2 binding site, an alignment that includes homologous sequences to human XPC from 38 species (the amino acid alignment is provided as supplemental data). Trp848 is completely conserved. The leucines at 851, 855, and 856 are highly conserved; only hydrophobic residues are found at positions 851 and 855. Lys849 is also conserved but can be substituted by the similar arginine or small hydrophobic amino acids. Given our finding that these residues are of prime significance in binding HsCen-2, interactions between proteins homologous to XPC and centrin 2 seem likely throughout eukaryotic phyla. We also determined the degree to which nonpolar atoms of HsCen-2 amino acids were occluded by the XPC peptide. The results identify in rank order Leu133, Leu112, Met145, Phe113, Met166, Leu126, Ala109, Glu105, and Val129. These nine nonpolar residues cover nearly every residue of the XPC peptide. The arrows in Fig. 2A point to specific HsCen-2 amino acids interacting with each residue of both XPC-derived peptides in the asymmetric unit. To be identified, amino acids must have substantial buried nonpolar surface within 4 Å of an XPC residue. Only minor differences are found among the interactions in both HsCen-2 binding cavities within the asymmetric unit. Several nonpolar interactions are of seemingly great consequence. 1) Both Met145 and Phe113 form the greater part of a deep pocket shown in Fig. 2C into which the invariant Trp848 of HsXPC is inserted. The Trp848 side chain also forms a weak hydrogen bond to the Met145 main chain. 2) Leu851 of HsXPC fits a shallow pocket formed largely by Leu133 and again Phe113.3) Leu855 of HsXPC associates most with Leu133, Leu112, and Phe113. 4) The packing of the aliphatic side chain of Lys849 of the peptide with Met166 buries substantial nonpolar surface. Closed Conformation for N-terminal Domain—The interhelical angles between α-helices within EF-hand protein structures have been used to classify and measure conformational state. The angular values for HsCen-2 indicate the N-terminal domain without calcium bound resides in a “closed” conformation (Table 2), although differences are found compared with those reported for a solution structure of the HsCen-2 N-terminal domain alone (27Yang A. Miron S. Duchambon P. Assairi L. Blouquit Y. Craescu C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Values for the C-terminal domain unsurprisingly indicate an open state. Data from equivalent computations on other homologous proteins are maintained on an internet Web site called the CaBP Data Library (available on the World Wide Web at structbio.vanderbilt.edu/cabp_database/).TABLE 2Interhelical angles within HsCen-2 Adding/removing 1-2 residues from the helical ends had little effect on these results computed by the Interhlx program. Sign convention is as described (1Drohat A.C. Amburgey J.C. Abildgaard F. Starich M.R. Baldisseri D. Weber D.J.

The α-helices are numbered I-IV to correspond with past literature on homologous EF-hand folds and with the interhelical angle data in Table 2. The bound peptide (green) and both Ca2+ atoms are presented as well. Looking at the blue ribbon, it is obvious that no helical peptide could bind within the N-terminal domain within its existing structure. Fig. 3 also allows comparison of the more distorted loops of EF-hand sites I and II in the N-terminal and without calcium present to sites III and IV. Site I differs from the more canonical HsCen-2 site IV (or EF-hand I in calmodulin) mainly by the replacement of an aspartate important for Ca2+ binding by Thr45. An analogous comparison suggests two substitutions reduce Ca2+ affinity at s"

The enzyme system is composed of two proteins: an FMN reductase (C1) and an oxygenase that uses FMNH– (C2). We report detailed transient kinetics studies at 4 °C of the reaction mechanism of C2.C2 binds rapidly and tightly to reduced FMN (Kd, 1.2 ± 0.2 μm), but less tightly to oxidized FMN (Kd, 250 ± 50 μm). The complex of C -FMNH–2 reacted with oxygen to form C(4a)-hydroperoxy-FMN at 1.1 ± 0.1 × 106 m–1 s–1, whereas the C -FMNH–2 -HPA complex reacted with oxygen to form C(4a)-hydroperoxy-FMN-HPA more slowly (k = 4.8 ± 0.2 × 104 m–1 s–1). The kinetic mechanism of C2 was shown to be a preferential random order type, in which HPA or oxygen can initially bind to the C -FMNH–2 complex, but the preferred path was oxygen reacting with C -FMNH–2 to form the C(4a)-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate prior to HPA binding. Hydroxylation occurs from the ternary complex with a rate constant of 20 s–1 to form the C2-C(4a)-hydroxy-FMN-DHPA complex. At high HPA concentrations (>0.5 mm), HPA formed a dead end complex with the C2-C(4a)-hydroxy-FMN intermediate (similar to single component flavoprotein hydroxylases), thus inhibiting the bound flavin from returning to the oxidized form. When FADH– was used, C(4a)-hydroperoxy-FAD, C(4a)-hydroxy-FAD, and product were formed at rates similar to those with FMNH–. Thus, C2 has the unusual ability to use both common flavin cofactors in catalysis. p-Hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase (HPAH) from Acinetobacter baumannii catalyzes the hydroxylation of p-hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (DHPA).

Most of these enzyme systems consist of reductase and monooxygenase components, where the reductase component provides reduced flavin for the monooxygenase component to use for hydroxylating the aromatic substrate. The number of enzymes known in this class continues to increase and many more hypothetical proteins derived from genome projects have also been identified (15Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Wongratana J. Suadee C. Chaiyen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1680: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hydroxylation of p-hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (DHPA) by HPAH is especially interesting because the same reaction is carried out by at least three types of two-component enzymes. The first HPAH purified was from P. putida, and it was shown to have FAD tightly bound to the smaller protein, and the larger protein (at that time) was thought to be a coupling protein enabling hydroxylation (4Arunachalam U.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11795-11801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A different HPAH system was later isolated from E. coli W, and studies have shown that the smaller component (HpaC) is a flavin reductase that generates reduced FAD to be transferred to the larger component (HpaB) to hydroxylate HPA (5Galan B.

Our group has isolated HPAH from A. baumannii and shown that the enzyme is quite different from the analogous HPAH enzymes from either P. putida or E. coli (6Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Wongratana J. Suadee C. Chaiyen P. Biochim. Biophys.

The A. baumannii HPAH is a two protein enzyme system consisting of a smaller reductase component (C1) and a larger oxygenase component (C2) (6Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sequence and several catalytic properties indicate that both components are different from others in the two protein class of aromatic hydroxylases (15Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Wongratana J. Suadee C. Chaiyen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1680: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10434-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our recent investigations of the reaction mechanisms of C1 have shown that HPA controls the reduction of C1-bound FMN by NADH by shifting the enzyme into a more active conformation (20Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10434-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By contrast, HPA has no effect at all on the activity of the reductase from the E. coli-type HPAH from P. aeruginosa (18Chakraborty S. Ortiz-Maldonado M. Eschenburg K. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Flavins and Flavoprotein. 2005; (ArchiTect, Tokyo): 161-166Google Scholar). The HPAH from P. putida (above) (16Arunachalam U. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11795-11801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) requires fresh examination based upon our current knowledge. It is possible that this enzyme system operates in a manner similar to the system from A. baumannii, but the essential experiments to test this possibility have not been carried out. C2 shows little sequence similarity to other oxygenases in the same class, and is unique for its ability to use reduced forms of riboflavin, FMN, or FAD to catalyze hydroxylations (6Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Wongratana J. Suadee C. Chaiyen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1680: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The overall reaction of C2 is described in Fig. 1. When C2 was mixed with reduced flavin and a limited amount of oxygen, an intermediate spectrum resembling that of a C(4a)-oxygen adduct of flavin was observed (6Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made in the analogous reactions of the oxygenase component involved in biosynthesis of actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor (ActVA) (21Valton J. Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44362-44369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Valton J. Fontecave M. Douki T. Kendrew S.G. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and with chlorophenol 4-monooxygenase (9Gisi M.R. Xun L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2786-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Despite preliminary observations that C(4a)-oxygenated intermediates are likely to be involved in oxygenation reactions of these oxygenase components, investigations by presteady state methods to elucidate the enzyme reaction mechanism in detail have never been carried out. In this article, we report investigations on the reaction of oxygen with C2 and reduced flavin using single mixing and double mixing stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The results comprehensively elucidate the reaction mechanism of C2, the order of substrate binding, and the binding constants of FMNH– and HPA to the enzyme. Reagents—NAD+, NADH, FAD, glucose, and glucose oxidase were from Sigma. FMN was prepared by conversion of FAD to FMN with snake venom from Crotalus adamanteus (23Duch D.S. Sr. LaskowskiM. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, FAD (2.5 mg/ml) and venom (50 μg/ml) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 were incubated overnight in the dark. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters), previously equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the cartridge was washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. FMN was eluted with water, and the solution was freeze-dried. Concentrations of the following compounds were determined using known extinction coefficients at pH 7.0: NADH, ϵ340 = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1; FAD, ϵ4500 = 11.3 mm–1 cm–1; FMN, ϵ446 = 12.2 mm–1 cm–1 and HPA, ϵ277 = 1.5 mm–1 cm–1 (6Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). C2 used in this study was cloned, expressed, and prepared as previously described (15Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Wongratana J. Suadee C. Chaiyen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1680: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The concentration of C2 was estimated from the extinction coefficient (based on amino acid sequence) of ϵ280 = 56.7 mm–1 cm–1. Enzyme Activity—Enzyme hydroxylation activity was detected in real time using a coupling reaction involving 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate dioxygenase (DHPAO) to convert the DHPA product of C2 to 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxy-muconate semi-aldehyde (CHS). This yellow compound has a maximum absorbance at 380 nm that is dependent upon pH (4Arunachalam U. Massey V. Vaidyanathan C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25848-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Studies—UV-visible absorbance spectra were recorded with a Hewlett Packard diode array spectrophotometer (HP 8453A), or a Shimadzu 2501PC spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Shimadzu RF5301PC spectrofluorometer. All these instruments were equipped with thermostatic cell compartments. Determination of the Kd for Binding Oxidized FMN to C2—The measurements were performed by an ultrafiltration method using Centriprep® Y-M 10 from Amicon. Solutions were composed of 10 μm FMN in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and various concentrations of C2, (20, 40, 80, 160, and 200 μm) in a 10-ml total volume. Each solution was centrifuged at 3,200 rpm, 4 °C for 15 min to obtain a filtrate of ∼1 ml (to minimize change in volume). The filtrate and retentate were analyzed for the amount of free and bound FMN, respectively. Ratios of the free and bound species were used to calculate the Kd value. Rapid Reaction Experiments—Reactions were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 4 °C, unless otherwise specified. Rapid kinetics measurements were performed with a Hi-Tech Scientific Model SF-61DX in double mixing mode, or with either a model SF-61SX or a SF-61DX stopped-flow spectrophotometer in single mixing mode. The optical pathlengths of the observation cells were 1 cm. The stopped-flow apparatus was made anaerobic by flushing the flow system with an oxygen-scrubbing solution consisting of 400 μm glucose, 1 mg/ml glucose oxidase (15.5 unit/ml), and 4.8 μg/ml catalase in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The oxygen-scrubbing solution was allowed to stand in the flow system overnight and was then thoroughly rinsed with anaerobic buffer before experiments. To study the oxidative half-reaction of C2, enzyme, or enzyme plus substrate and oxidized FMN in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were made anaerobic in glass tonometers by several cycles of evacuation followed by equilibration with argon that had been passed through an Oxyclear oxygen removal column (Labclear). Enzyme was anaerobically reduced with a solution of sodium dithionite (∼5 mg/ml in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) delivered from a syringe attached to the tonometer, and the reduction was monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry. Solutions with various concentrations of oxygen were prepared by equilibrating buffer with air or with certified oxygen/nitrogen gas mixtures. Determinations of rate constants were obtained by fitting plots of apparent rate constants (kobs) versus concentration of substrate with a Marquardt-Levenberg non-linear fit algorithm that is included in the KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software). The kobs from kinetic traces were calculated from exponential fits using KinetA-syst3 software (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) or program A (written at the University of Michigan by Rong Chang, Jung-yen Chiu, Joel Dinverno, and D. P. Ballou). Reaction of C2-FMNH– with O2 in the Absence of HPA—A solution of FMN (16 μm) plus C2 (25 μm) was placed in a glass tonometer equipped with a quartz cuvette, and made anaerobic as described under “Materials and Methods.” An anaerobic solution of sodium dithionite was delivered into the tonometer to stoichiometrically reduce the FMN (see “Materials and Methods”). The resulting C2-FMNH– complex was loaded onto the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, where its reaction with oxygen was monitored at 380 and 446 nm (Fig. 2). A significant fraction of the first phase, which is shown by an increase in absorbance at 380 nm and no change at 446 nm, occurred during the dead time of the instrument (∼0.002 s) and was complete by 0.006–0.02 s (high to low oxygen concentration, Fig. 2). The plot of kobs of this phase versus oxygen concentration was linear, yielding a second-order rate constant of 1.1 ± 0.1 × 106 m–1 s–1 (inset in Fig. 2). When absorbance values at the end of the first phase (reaction time of 0.01 s of highest oxygen reaction) at various wavelengths were plotted, the spectrum B in Fig. 3 was obtained. This spectrum has characteristics typical for a flavin-C(4a)-adduct with maximum absorbance at 380 nm. Based upon analogy to the reactions catalyzed by one component hydroxylases and the condition that HPA is absent, the spectrum B in Fig. 3 is likely to be C(4a)-hydroperoxy-FMN (1Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Active Oxygen in Biochemistry. 1995; (Chapman & Hall, Glasgow, Scotland): 37-83Crossref Google Scholar, 2Palfey B.A. Massey V.

Biophys. 2005; 433: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Spectrum B is also similar to that of C(4a)-hydroperoxyflavins generally found in the class of single component aromatic hydroxylases (1Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V.

The hydroperoxide intermediate decayed slowly to yield oxidized FMN and probably H2O2 (at 0.037 ± 0.002 s–1, see traces at 446 nm from 1 to 100 s in Fig. 2). A small increase in absorbance at 380 nm was also observed between 0.01 and 1 s, and the kobs describing this phase was also dependent on oxygen concentration. Based on the Kd value of C2-FMNH– of 1.2 ± 0.2 μm (described in the next paragraph), ∼1.6 μm free FMNH– is present under these reaction conditions. Therefore, this small absorbance change is likely to be because of free FMNH– reacting with oxygen.FIGURE 3Absorbance spectra observed during the reoxidation of C2-FMNH–. Results from the experiment described in the legend to Fig. 2 monitored at various wavelengths ranging from 310 to 550 nm, were used for plotting the intermediate spectrum. The dashed line (A) represents the beginning C2-FMNH– complex, and the solid line (C) represents the spectrum of the final species, oxidized FMN with C2. The intermediate spectrum (B) was obtained by plotting absorbance values occurring at the reaction time of 0.01 s. This is valid because the decomposition of the intermediate is very slow compared with its rate of formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the same reaction of the C2-FMNH– complex was investigated with fluorescence detection using the excitation wavelengths of 360–446 nm and emission at wavelengths of greater than 500 nm, fluorescence increases were only observed with formation of the final species, oxidized FMN (data not shown). This result indicated that the C2-C(4a)-hydroperoxy-FMN was non-fluorescent. Determination of Binding Constants of Reduced and Oxidized Flavin to C2—Free reduced FMN was mixed with air-saturated C2 solution in the stopped-flow apparatus, resulting in a reaction with kinetic traces nearly identical to those obtained when preformed C2-FMNH– was mixed with oxygen, as shown in Fig. 2. This result implies that binding of FMNH– to C2 is much faster than the oxidation of free FMNH– by oxygen (32Massey V. Palmer G. Ballou D.P. Flavins and Flavoproteins. 1971; (3rd International Symposium, University Park Press, Baltimore, MD)Google Scholar), and also greater than the rate of formation of the C(4a)-flavin hydroperoxide at 0.13 mm oxygen, 185 ± 9s–1 (Fig. 2). Thus, the rate constant for C2 binding to FMNH– is likely to be ≥107 m–1 s–1 (k1 in Fig. 10). Therefore, when FMNH– (16 μm) was mixed with various concentrations of C2 in air-saturated buffer in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, the absorbance increase at 380 nm during the first phase (Fig. 4), because of the C(4a)-hydroperoxy FMN formed, was also directly dependent on the amount of C2-FMNH– complex initially present. In the absence of C2 (the lowest trace), the absorbance increased with a t½ ∼0.7 s as free FMNH– oxidized to FMN in a complex autocatalytic reaction (32Massey V. Palmer G. Ballou D.P. Flavins and Flavoproteins. 1971; (3rd International Symposium, University Park Press, Baltimore, MD)Google Scholar). As the concentration of C2 increased, less auto-oxidation of FMNH– is observed. Therefore, the increase in absorbance observed at 0.04 s represents the amount of C2-FMNH– present at the start of the reaction, and the plot of this change in absorbance versus the free C2 concentration represents the binding isotherm for FMNH–. The plot (inset in Fig. 4) shows that the absorbance increase is hyperbolically dependent on C2 concentration. A Kd (referred to as K Ad in the kinetic scheme in Fig. 10) value for the complex was calculated to be 1.2 ± 0.2 μm. The Kd for the binding of oxidized FMN to C2 was determined by an ultrafiltration method described under “Materials and Methods.” This experiment indicated that the Kd of C2-FMN was 250 ± 50 μm. The large uncertainty occurred because values could not be obtained at appropriately high C2 concentrations. Reaction of the C2-FMNH–-HPA Complex with Oxygen—The reaction of C2 in the presence of substrate was investigated by mixing an anaerobic solution of FMNH– (16 μm), C2 (25 μm), and 2 mm HPA with buffer containing various oxygen concentrations in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Fig. 5). The rate of formation of C2 intermediate in presence of HPA was second order with respect to oxygen; however, the reaction is considerably slower than when no HPA is present (compare the increases at 380 nm in Fig. 2 to those in Fig. 5). An obvious interpretation of this result is that the reaction with oxygen is slower when HPA is bound to the enzyme. This interpretation was later verified (Figs. 7 and 8). In experiments where the concentration of HPA was varied in double mixing stopped-flow experiments, the rate of formation of C(4a)-hydroperoxy-FMN decreased with increasing concentrations of HPA (data not shown).FIGURE 7Kinetics of C2-FMNH– complex formation with HPA. Formation of the complex was investigated by double mixing stopped-flow spectrophotometry. In the first mix, HPA was added anaerobically to C2-FMNH–, and after various age times (0.05, 0.1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 s, upper to lower traces), oxygen was mixed with the aged solution. The final concentrations after double mixing were 16 μm C2-FMNH– (25 μm C2 plus 16 μm FMNH–), 2 mm HPA and 1.03 mm oxygen. Reactions were monitored by absorbance at 380 nm to assess the amount of C2-C(4a)-hydroperoxy-FMN formed. The dotted line represents the reaction of C2-FMNH– with oxygen under the same conditions. A plot of absorbance amplitudes that occurred at 380 nm at ∼54 s–1 versus the age time (inset) represents the binding kinetics of HPA to C2-FMNH–.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 8Dissociation constant for binding HPA to C2-FMNH–. This was measured by double mixing stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The first mix added various concentrations of HPA (80, 160, 400, 800, 2000, 4000, 8000 μm, from upper to lower traces) anaerobically to C2-FMNH– (16 μm), and the second mix added 1.03 mm oxygen to the resultant mixture. The age time between mixes was 10 s to ensure the complete formation of any C2-FMNH–-HPA complex, and the reactions were monitored at 370 nm. All concentrations given are after final mixing. The amplitude changes in the phase occurring at 54 s–1 (dead time to 80 ms) versus the HPA concentration are plotted in inset A and this was used to calculate the Kd (180 ± 30 μm) for binding of HPA to C2-FMNH–. Inset B shows the formation of oxidized FMN at 446 nm (see also Fig. 9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 5 shows that the reaction monitored at 380 nm consists of 4 phases. For example, with 130 μm oxygen (concentration after mixing), the first phase consisted of an increase of absorbance of ∼0.026 AU occurring during the dead time, and continuing until ∼0.012 s. With the highest oxygen concentration used (1.03 mm), this phase was complete during the dead time of the instrument. This first phase was dependent on oxygen concentration and is characterized by a rate constant of 1.1 ± 0.1 × 106 m–1 s–1 (data not shown). This value is the same as that observed in the reaction of C -FMNH–2 with oxygen in Fig. 2 (with no HPA present). The second phase (∼0.012–0.6 s) of ∼0.079 AU at 380 nm was also dependent on oxygen concentration and was characterized by a second order rate constant of 4.8 ± 0.2 × 104 m–1 s–1 (data not shown). Therefore, the first phase is likely to be the reaction of oxygen with C -FMNH–2 without HPA bound, whereas the second phase is due to the ternary complex C -FMNH–2 -HPA reacting with oxygen. The third phase is a lag in absorbance at 380 nm and corresponds to a process with a rate of ∼17–22 s–1 (k6 in Fig. 10). This phase can only be resolved clearly in the reaction with 1.03 mm oxygen. The decrease in absorbance because of the fourth phase (0.7–20 s) was coupled with a large increase at 446 nm; this phase was fitted with a rate constant (0.35 ± 0.02 s–1) that was independent of oxygen concentration. The absorption spectra of intermediates were calculated from the traces over a range of wavelengths of the reaction with 1.03 mm oxygen using the following rate constants: 54 s–1 for formation of the first intermediate, 20 s–1 for the second intermediate, and 0.35 s–1 for the final step in which oxidized FMN is formed. The analysis shows that spectra of the two intermediates are very similar (inset of Fig. 5), and have absorption characteristics similar to C(4a)-intermediates found for the single component flavoprotein hydroxylases (1Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P.

https://openalex.org/W2149630882,"We have reconstituted a highly purified RNA polymerase II transcription system containing chromatin templates assembled with purified histones and assembly factors, the histone acetyltransferase p300, and components of the general transcription machinery that, by themselves, suffice for activated transcription (initiation and elongation) on DNA templates. We show that this system mediates activator-dependent initiation, but not productive elongation, on chromatin templates. We further report the purification of a chromatin transcription-enabling activity (CTEA) that, in a manner dependent upon p300 and acetyl-CoA, strongly potentiates transcription elongation through several contiguous nucleosomes as must occur in vivo. The transcription elongation factor SII is a major component of CTEA and strongly synergizes with p300 (histone acetylation) at a step subsequent to preinitiation complex formation. The purification of CTEA also identified HMGB2 as a coactivator that, while inactive on its own, enhances SII and p300 functions."
https://openalex.org/W2160986262,"The type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) has been reported to be overactivated in the failing heart, leading to a depression in cardiac function. We investigated whether in vivo PP1 inhibition by myocardial gene transfer of inhibitor-2 (INH-2), an endogenous PP1 inhibitor, alleviates heart failure (HF) progression in the cardiomyopathic (CM) hamster, a well-established HF model. Adenoviral INH-2 gene delivery improved % fractional shortening of the left ventricle (LV) accompanied by reduced chamber size at 1 wk. In vivo myocardial INH-2 gene delivery induced an increase in cytosolic PP1 catalytic subunit alpha (PP1Calpha) without inducing the corresponding increase in cytosolic PP1 activity. On the other hand, INH-2 delivery induced a decrease in microsomal PP1Calpha, resulting in a preferential decrease in microsomal PP1 activity, thereby increasing in phospholamban phosphorylation at Ser16. INH-2 gene transfer alleviated brain natriuretic peptide expression, presumably reflecting improved cardiac function. Moreover, adeno-associated virus-mediated INH-2 gene delivery significantly extended the survival time for 3 mo. These results indicate that increased PP1 activity is an exacerbating factor during progression of genetic cardiomyopathy and modulation of PP1 activity by INH-2 provides a potential new treatment for HF without activating protein kinase A signaling in cardiomyocytes."

Cerebellar ataxia typically appears in infancy and is an early sign of a progressive neurological syndrome that includes choreoathetosis, dystonia, oculomotor apraxia, limitation on facial expressiveness, dysarthria, and difficulty in swallowing that often causes aspirations leading to sinopulmonary infections. Most A-T patients become wheel-chair-bound by the end of the first decade of life. The ataxia reflects progressive degeneration of the cerebellar cortex with striking loss of the Purkinje and granule cells; impairment of the extrapyramidal movement system and peripheral neuropathy are also established features of A-T (1Chun H.H. Gatti R.A. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 2Crawford T.O. Semin. Pediatr.

Neurology. 2000; 54: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A-T results from null mutations in the ATM gene, which encodes the protein kinase ATM. ATM is the primary mobilizer of the cellular response to double strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA, an elaborate network of signaling pathways that swiftly modulates many physiological processes (4Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Cell. 2004; 118: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 5Shiloh Y. Lehmann A.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DSBs are first sensed by sensor/mediator proteins that activate the transducers, which in turn convey the DNA damage alarm to many downstream effectors that control specific pathways. ATM, the chief transducer of the DSB alarm, is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase (PIKK) family (6Abraham R.T. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Following DSB induction ATM is rapidly autophosphorylated and activated (7Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar) and phosphorylates numerous substrates, each of which in turn modulates a specific pathway (8Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 9Kurz E.U. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A-T is a multisystem disease but primarily a neurodegenerative disorder. While the defect in the DNA damage response could explain the defective cellular response to DSBs in A-T cells and several features of the disease, it has been conceptually difficult to relate it to the prominent symptom of A-T, the progressive neuronal degeneration. Understanding the role of ATM in the nervous system is crucial to understanding the disease but has remained largely elusive. ATM functions have been investigated mainly in cultured proliferating cells, in which an important role of the DNA damage response is to activate the cell cycle checkpoints (8Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 10Lukas J. Lukas C. Bartek J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Conceivably, these checkpoints are not activated in post-mitotic cells. Furthermore, several investigators suggested that ATM was cytoplasmic in human and murine neuronal tissues and hence was functioning in pathways unrelated to the DNA damage response (11Oka A. Takashima S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 252: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12Kuljis R.O. Chen G. Lee E.Y. Aguila M.C. Xu Y.

Mariani J. Eckhaus M. Herrup K. Bailly Y. Wynshaw-Boris A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory led us to the conclusion that the neuronal degeneration in A-T does in fact result from a defective response to DSBs (14Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to study the subcellular localization of ATM and the ATM-mediated DSB response in human neurons. These experiments required the use of cultured cells that simulate human neuronal differentiation. Neuroblastoma cell lines provide extensively characterized models of neuronal differentiation in culture: they maintain their potential to undergo terminal neuronal differentiation upon treatment with a variety of agents. The resultant neuron-like cells (NLCs) are homogeneous populations of cells with the typical morphology and biochemical markers of primary cultures of neurons (15Encinas M. Iglesias M. Liu Y. Wang H.

We found that, similar to proliferating cells, NLCs are capable of activating a pronounced DSB response that is mediated by nuclear ATM. Cell Cultures—We used two extensively characterized neuronal differentiation systems based on the human NB cell lines LA-N-5 and SH-SY5Y, which differentiate into NLCs upon treatment with retinoic acid (RA) or a combination of RA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), respectively (15Encinas M.

Human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293T, U2OS, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Differentiation of LA-N-5 and SH-SY5Y cells was carried out as described previously (15Encinas M. Iglesias M. Liu Y. Wang H. Muhaisen A. Cena V. Gallego C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 16Hill D.P. Robertson K.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 102: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, LA-N-5 cells were treated with 10 μm RA (Sigma) for 7 days in complete medium and SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 10 μm retinoic acid in complete medium for 5 days and for another 2 days with 40 ng/ml BDNF (Cytolab, Rehovot, Israel) in serum-free medium. DNA-damaging Agents and ATM Inhibitors—Neocarzinostatin (NCS) was obtained from Kayaku Chemicals Co. (Tokyo, Japan), etoposide was from Sigma.

(Burlington, CA); secondary antibodies α-mouse IgG and α-rabbit IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-rabbit IgG and α-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Vectors and Constructs—Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) containing a sequence complementary to a 19- or 21-nt sequence beginning at position 912 or 8538 of ATM mRNA (GenBank™ accession number U33841) was cloned into the retroviral vector pRetroSuper (23Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar) (a gift from R. Agami). ATM was stably knocked down using two siRNA sequences corresponding to positions 912 (shRNA#1) and 8538 (shRNA#3) of the ATM transcript. Cells were infected with retroviral particles according to standard protocols and selected with 0.5 μg/ml (LA-N-5) or 1 μg/ml (SH-SY5Y) puromycin. The following constructs were used: GFP, 5′-gatccccGGAGCGCACCATCTTCTTCttcaagagaGAAGAAGATGGTGCGCTCCtttttggaaa-3′; LacZ, 5′-gatccccAAGGCCAGACGCGAATTATttcaagagaataattcgcgtctggcctttttttggaaa-3′; ATM#1 (position 912), 5′-gatccccGACTTTGGCTGTCAACTTTCGttcaagagaCGAAAGTTGACAGCCAAAGTCtttttggaaa-3′; ATM#3 (position 8538), 5′-gatccccTGAAGATGGTGCTCATAAAttcaagagaTTTATGAGCACCATCTTCAtttttggaaa-3′. RT-PCR—Five μg of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis primed by oligo(dT) and carried out using Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcript was used as control. The primers used are as follows: calcitonin, 5′-GTCGCCGCCGCTTCCACA 3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTAGATTACCGCACCGCTTAGA-3′ (reverse); hGAPDH, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (reverse); retinoic acid receptor α (RARα), 5′-GTGCATCATTAAGACTGTGGAGTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGCAGCATGTCCACCCGGTC-3′ (reverse). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Proliferating LA-N-5 and SH-SY5Y cells were seeded on 0.1% gelatin or collagen precoated glass coverslips, respectively, and underwent neuronal differentiation as described above. NLCs were treated with DSB-causing agents and 30 min after treatment were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by a 10 min incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Coverslips were blocked for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal donkey serum in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight in 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in primary antibody dilution buffer (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), washed, incubated with secondary antibody for 30 min, and stained with DAPI. Immunostaining of ATM was carried as described previously (24Wilson D.M. Bianchi IIIC. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope. Immunoblotting Analysis—Cell were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA supplemented with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Gel electrophoresis, blotting, reaction with antibodies, and development of blots using enhanced chemiluminescence were carried out as described previously (14Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Characterization of Neuronal Differentiation of LA-N-5 and SHSY5Y—Following treatment with RA (LA-N-5 cells) or sequential exposure to RA and BDNF (SH-SY5Y cells), these cell lines underwent morphological differentiation into NLCs resembling primary neurons, including cell dissociation, dendrite extension, and formation of extensive networks (Fig. 1A). These morphological changes were accompanied by the expression of several neuron-specific markers: neurofilament 200 (NF200), neuron-specific class III β-tubulin Tuj1, neuronal polarity markers such as tau, microtubule-associated protein (MAP2) and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), the neurotrophic receptor TrkA, the retinoic acid receptor, and the neuropeptide calcitonine (Fig. 1, B-D, and supplemental Fig. 1). Notably, there was a decrease in the level of vimentin, an intermediate filament expressed in mesenchymal cells but not in neurons (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the majority of differentiated NLCs were no longer cycling, evidenced by the small fraction of cells exhibiting the proliferation marker ki-67 (Fig. 1D); the reduced levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the retinoblastoma protein pRb and the oncoprotein N-Myc, and the induction of the Cdk-inhibitor p27kip1 (Fig. 1, C and D). These changes in morphology and molecular markers are typical of differentiated NLCs as described previously (15Encinas M. Iglesias M. Liu Y. Wang H. Muhaisen A. Cena V. Gallego C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 16Hill D.P. Robertson K.A. Brain Res. Dev.

Oncol. 2001; 36: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Changes in the Levels of DNA Damage Response Proteins upon Differentiation into NLCs—It was previously reported that ATM expression is highest in the embryonic nervous system and markedly reduced in the adult nervous system (11Oka A. Takashima S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 252: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Allen D.M. van Praag H. Ray J. Weaver Z. Winrow C.J. Carter T.A. Braquet R. Harrington E. Ried T.

Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We asked whether the differentiation into NLC affected the cellular levels of several key players in the DNA damage response: the ATM protein; the Nbs1 protein, a member of the MRN (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) complex, a DSB sensor that is involved in the initial processing of the breaks and is required for ATM activation (14Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 28Stracker T.H. Theunissen J.W. Morales M. Petrini J.H.

Biol. 2005; 25: 5363-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar); the protein kinase ATR, which belongs to the PIKK family and responds to replication stress and UV damage but also acts redundantly with ATM in the late stages of the DSB response (31Shechter D. Costanzo V. Gautier J. DNA Repair. (Amst.). 2004; 3: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar); and the aprataxin protein (APTX1), which is involved in the repair of single strand breaks and is defective in patients with ataxia oculomotor apraxia 1 (AOA1) (32Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Clements P.M. Breslin C. Deeks E.D. Byrd P.J. Ju L. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Moreira M.C. Taylor A.M. Caldecott K.W.

Life Sci. 2005; 62: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Notably, neuronal differentiation in culture was followed by various degrees of reduction in the cellular levels of all the DSB response proteins tested, with the exception of the aprataxin protein, which increased (Fig. 2). ATM Knockdown Does Not Affect Neuronal Differentiation—To examine the ATM dependence of DSB response in NLCs it was essential to knock down their endogenous ATM and obtain isogenic NLCs that differ only in their ATM content. We stably knocked down ATM in LA-N-5 and SH-SY5Y cells by expressing in them two shRNAs against ATM mRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) using the retroviral vector pRETRO-SUPER (23Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). Irrelevant shRNAs against bacterial LacZ or GFP served as controls. We first monitored the differentiation process of ATM-deficient neuroblastomas. Following the differentiation procedure, ATM-deficient NLCs were morphologically similar to ATM-proficient NLCs and exhibited the same neuronal markers (Fig. 3). It should be noted that although retroviral silencing may occur upon cellular differentiation (36Ellis J. Hum. Gene Ther. 2005; 16: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 37Ellis J. Yao S. Curr. Gene Ther. 2005; 5: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and this could potentially affect the stability of shRNA expression, ATM knockdown remained stable in our NLCs throughout their life in culture. We concluded that in this system neuronal differentiation does not require normal ATM levels. The availability of ATM-deficient NLCs now allowed us to explore the ATM-mediated DNA damage response in this type of cells. Nuclear ATM in NLCs—It is well accepted that ATM in cultured proliferating cells is predominantly a nuclear protein with a minor cytoplasmic fraction (38Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tagle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, several reports claimed that ATM in neuronal tissues was mainly cytoplasmic (11Oka A. Takashima S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 252: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12Kuljis R.O. Chen G. Lee E.Y. Aguila M.C. Xu Y. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Barlow C. Ribaut-Barassin C. Zwingman T.A. Pope A.J. Brown K.D. Owens J.W. Larson D. Harrington E.A. Haeberle A.M. Mariani J. Eckhaus M. Herrup K. Bailly Y. Wynshaw-Boris A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We used immunostaining to examine the subcellular localization of ATM in our NLCs. Although most of the currently available anti-ATM antibodies were tested by us and found not to be ATM-specific in immunostaining tests, the monoclonal antibody 5C2 and the monoclonal antibody Y170 that were used in this study were more reliable. Knocking down ATM in HeLa and U2OS cells considerably reduced their nuclear signals (Fig. 4A), and we attributed the remaining signal to residual ATM or low cross-reactivity with another nuclear protein. Importantly, in ATM-proficient NLCs these antibodies exhibited strong nuclear staining, which turned into faint cytoplasmic or pan-cellular staining in ATM-deficient NLCs (Fig. 4B, C). We regard the staining pattern in ATM-deficient NLCs as background caused by nonspecific reactions of the antibody in the absence of its primary antigen. Similar results were obtained with the other ATM shRNA. We concluded that while a minor cytoplasmic fraction of ATM in NLCs could not be ruled out, the vast majority of its content in these cells was nuclear. Activation of the ATM-mediated DSB Response in NLCs—The above results set the scene for close examination of the ATM-mediated DNA damage response in NLCs. This elaborate signaling network can be monitored by following the phosphorylation of its various components, including the autophosphorylation of ATM that marks its activation (7Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar), and phosphorylations of ATM targets. The main tools in this analysis are specific anti-phospho antibodies. We treated LA-N-5 cells and their NLC derivatives with the radiomimetic drug NCS, a potent inducer of DSBs in the DNA (39Povirk L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis using anti-phospho antibodies showed ATM activation and phosphorylation of several downstream substrates in both the parental LA-N-5 cells and the derived NLCs, with some attenuation in NLCs compared with the parental cells (Fig. 5A). Importantly, these responses were ATM-dependent: in both the parent cells and the NLCs, knocking down ATM abolished these phosphorylations (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained with SH-SY5Y cells and derived NLCs (data not shown). Administration of a specific ATM inhibitor, KU-55933 (40Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M. Orr A.I. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9152-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) into the cultures abrogated these responses in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, C and D). We further characterized the DSB response in NLCs by immunostaining, which allows subcellular localization of the response and demonstration of one of its important facets, the formation of nuclear foci at the damage sites by recruited damage response proteins. The staining readouts of the DSB response in NLCs were similar to those obtained in commonly used proliferating cell lines and were typically nuclear (Fig. 6A) and ATM-dependent (Fig. 6B and supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). Either ATM knockdown (Fig. 6B) or the ATM inhibitor (supplemental Fig. 3) abrogated these responses or abolished them completely. We concluded that our NLCs possess a DSB response with similar characteristics to that of proliferating cells, which is similarly mediated by activated nuclear ATM.FIGURE 6Nuclear DNA damage responses in NLCs are ATM-dependent. A, initial characterization of the DSB response in LA-N-5-derived NLCs using immunostaining. The cells were treated with 200 ng/ml NCS, and the following nuclear responses were monitored 30 min later: phosphorylation of histone H2AX at the DSB sites (90Fernandez-Capetillo O. Lee A. Nussenzweig M. Nussenzweig A.

https://openalex.org/W2084000984,"The threat of pandemic human influenza looms as we survey the ongoing avian influenza pandemic and wonder if and when it will jump species. What are the risks and how can we plan? The nub of the problem lies in the inherent variability of the virus, which makes prediction difficult. However, it is not impossible; mathematical models can help determine and quantify critical parameters and thresholds in the relationships of those parameters, even if the relationships are nonlinear and obscure to simple reasoning. Mathematical models can derive estimates for the levels of drug stockpiles needed to buy time, how and when to modify vaccines, whom to target with vaccines and drugs, and when to enforce quarantine measures. Regardless, the models used for pandemic planning must be tested, and for this we must continue to gather data, not just for exceptional scenarios but also for seasonal influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2014716406,"Activation and dysfunction of the endothelium underlie many vascular disorders including atherosclerosis, tumor growth, and inflammation. We recently reported that thrombin and vascular endothelial growth factor, but not tumor necrosis factor-α, results in dramatic up-regulation of Down syndrome critical region (DSCR)-1 gene in endothelial cells, a negative feedback regulator of calcineurin-NFAT signaling. Constitutive expression of DSCR-1 in activated endothelial cells markedly impaired NFAT nuclear localization, proliferation, tube formation, and tumor growth. The goal of the present study was to elucidate the relative roles of NFAT/DSCR-1 and NF-κB/I-κB in mediating thrombin-responsive gene expression in endothelial cells. DNA microarrays of thrombin-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells overexpressing DSCR-1 or constitutive active IκBα revealed genes that were dependent on NFAT and/or NF-κB activity. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 was inhibited both by DSCR-1 and I-κB at the level of mRNA, protein, promoter activity, and function (monocyte adhesion). Using a combination of transient transfections, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, thrombin was shown to induce time-dependent coordinate binding of RelA and NFATc to a tandem NF-κB element in the upstream promoter region of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Together, these findings suggest that thrombin-mediated activation of endothelial cells involves an interplay between NFAT and NF-κB signaling pathways and their negative feedback inhibitors, DSCR-1 and I-κB, respectively. As natural brakes in the inflammatory process, DSCR-1 and I-κB may lend themselves to therapeutic manipulation in vasculopathic disease states.

As natural brakes in the inflammatory process, DSCR-1 and I-κB may lend themselves to therapeutic manipulation in vasculopathic disease states. The endothelium is highly malleable cell layer constantly responding to changes within the extracellular environment and responding in ways that are usually beneficial but at times harmful to the organism. Several extracellular mediators activate gene transcription in endothelial cells, resulting in changes in hemostatic balance, increased leukocyte adhesion, permeability, migration, and proliferation. The tight control of these processes is essential for maintaining homeostasis; endothelial cell activation, if excessive, over-sustained, or spatially and temporally misplaced, may lead to vasculopathic disease such as pathological angiogenesis, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Under normal conditions, activation signals may be terminated by negative feedback inhibition of downstream transcriptional networks. Such a paradigm is well established for transcription factors, NF-κB, Egr-1, and Smad-2/3, which activate the self-inhibitory molecules, IκBα, nerve growth factor induced A-binding protein (NAB), and Smad-7, respectively (1.Scott M.L.

In humans, the DSCR-1 gene (also known as calcipressin 1, MCIP-1, and Adapt 78) consists of 7 exons, of which exons 1-4 can be alternatively spliced, resulting in a number of different mRNA isoforms (5.Fuentes J.J.

For example, the DSCR-1 exon 4-7 variant is regulated by a calcineurin- and GATA-dependent pathway (4.Minami T. Horiuchi K. Miura M. Abid M.R. Takabe W. Noguchi N. Kohro T. Ge X. Aburatani H.

Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease that is involved not only in mediating the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin in the coagulation cascade but also in activating a variety of cell types, including platelets, vascular smooth muscle, and endothelial cells (8.Coughlin S.R.

Thrombin signaling in the endothelium is mediated by a family of seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors, termed protease activated receptors (PARs). Currently, four members of the PAR family have been isolated (PAR-1-4). In endothelial cells PAR-1 is thought to be predominant thrombin receptor. Once activated, PAR-1 is linked to a number of signal intermediates (including mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinases C and A, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and calcineurin), transcription factors (such as Egr-1, NF-κB, NFAT, SP-1, and AP-1), and downstream target genes (e.g. vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, E-selectin, fractalkine, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, endothelial-specific molecule-1, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and HB-EGF) (4.Minami T.

In this study we employed global gene expression profiles to elucidate the relative roles of NFAT-DSCR-1 and NF-κB-IκB pathways in mediating thrombin signaling in endothelial cells. We identified several thrombin target genes that require both transcription factors for activation. Among these was the proinflammatory gene, VCAM-1, which is reported to play a critical role in firm leukocyte adhesion in diverse inflammatory disease states (14.Gando S. Kameue T. Matsuda N.

The results suggest that DSCR-1-mediated inhibition of NFAT signaling may be leveraged for therapeutic gain in inflammatory states. Materials and Cell Culture—VEGF and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were obtained from Peprotec (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human thrombin and cyclosporine A (CsA) were obtained from Calbiochem. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown in endothelial growth medium-2-MV (EGM-2-MV) BulletKit (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). HUVEC were used within the first 8 passages. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human U937 cells (JCRB-9021) were grown in RPMI medium plus 10% FBS. Plasmids and Adenoviruses—Construction of wild type human VCAM-1 luc and -251NFAT-like-mut-luc was previously described (11.Minami T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47632-47641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To generate -216NFAT-like mut-luc and NF-κB-mut-luc, a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction with the mutated oligonucleotides shown in supplemental Table I. To generate the mouse VCAM-1-luc plasmid, the mouse 2.5-kilobase promoter was amplified by PCR using the BAC clone (RPCI23 362K11) as template and subcloned into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, MI). NFAT expression vector (pCMV-NFATc) was purchased from Invitrogen (IMAGE clone ID 5354603). The RelA expression plasmid (pCMV-RelA) was kindly provided by Dr. Mukesh Jain (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). For construction of pTNT-mNFATc, a SalI-NotI fragment containing mNFATc was subcloned into the SalI/NotI-digested pTNT vector (Promega). Human IκBα cDNA fragment was amplified using PCR from reverse-transcribed HUVEC total RNA and subcloned into the pGEM-T easy (Promega). Constitutive active (CA; S32A and S36A) IκBα was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and mutated primer pairs (supplemental Table I). The EcoRI-digested CA-IκBα fragment was subcloned into pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to generate pIRES2-CA-IκBα-EGFP. The generation of adenovirus (Ad)-Control, Ad-DSCR-1, and Ad-CA-NFAT was previously described (4.Minami T. Horiuchi K. Miura M. Abid M.R. Takabe W. Noguchi N. Kohro T. Ge X. Aburatani H. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50537-50554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For the construction of the Ad-CA-IκBα, pIRES2-CA-IκBα-EGFP was digested with NheI and AflII, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into the pShuttle and Adeno-X DNA (Clontech) using the Adeno-X adenoviral expression system (Clontech). All cloned and subcloned constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions and automated DNA sequencing. Microarray Analysis—Two independent lots of HUVEC were infected with either Ad-Control, Ad-DSCR-1, Ad-CA-NFAT, or Ad-CA-IκBα (multiplicity of infection of 30) for 2 days, serum-starved overnight in medium containing EBM-2 (Clonetics) and 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without 2 units/ml thrombin for 4 h. RNA was harvested and purified with Trizol (Invitrogen). Preparation of cRNA and hybridization of probe arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Each array experiment was performed duplicate. File maker software was used for the genes that demonstrated identical patterns in both experiments. Data were analyzed according to the minimum information about a microarray experiment (MIAME) rule. Annotation of the probe numbers and targeted sequences were shown in Affymetrix web page. Quantitative Real-time PCR—RNA was extracted from endothelial cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Two μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II enzyme using oligo-dT primer as specified by Invitrogen. Real-time PCR including SYBR Green PCR reagent was performed on an instrument according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Primer pairs are indicated in supplemental Table I. Plasmid DNA and siRNA Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—HUVEC and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), and luciferase activities were calculated using the dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega) as previously described (11.Minami T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47632-47641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The serum-starved transfected HUVEC were incubated with 50 ng/ml VEGF, 2 units/ml thrombin, and/or 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 6 h. For siRNA transfection, HUVEC were incubated with a mixture of 40 nm siRNA and lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) for 6 h. Medium was replaced, and cells were cultured with EGM-2-MV for 24 h. After serum-starvation (EBM-2 plus 0.5% FBS) and agonist treatment, cells were processed for real-time PCR, Western blot, or adhesion assays. Targeted siRNA sequences (Invitrogen) are shown in supplemental Table I. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extraction and EMSA were carried out as previously described (18.Minami T. Rosenberg R.D. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5395-5402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To reduce nonspecific binding, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Invitrogen) and 20 fmol of oligonucleotide spanning the flk-1/KDR SP1 motifs (supplemental Table I) were added to the reaction mixture. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment and purified by spin column (Amersham Biosciences). Oligonucleotide sequences used for probes and competitors are shown in supplemental Table I. To test the effect of antibodies on DNA-protein binding, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies against NFATc (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), Ets-1, RelA, and IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. Recombinant NFATc and RelA were generated using the TNT-coupled wheat germ extract systems (Promega) with pTNT-mNFATc and pCMV-RelA, respectively, according the manufacturer's instruction. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analysis—HUVEC were treated with thrombin for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h, subsequently exposed to 1% formaldehyde (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with icecold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), then scraped and collected by centrifugation. The cells pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and incubated for 10 min. The cross-linked chromatin was subjected to sonication using BioRuptor (Cosmobio, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain DNA fragments of 200-500 bp. The chromatin complexes were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and diluted 6-fold in ChIP dilution buffer containing protease inhibitor (Upstate). Preclear experiments were employed in the addition of 100 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A (Upstate) (for RelA) or salmon sperm DNA/protein G (Upstate) (for NFATc1). The samples were immunoprecipitated with 8 μg of anti-RelA, anti-Pol II (Santa Cruz), anti-NFATc1 (Affinity Bioreagents), or control IgG (Santa Cruz). Precipitated chromatin complexes were washed and eluted according to the ChIP assay kit instructions (Upstate). PCR and real-time PCR reactions were performed with the primer pairs as shown in supplemental Table I. Western Blot Analysis—HUVEC were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected with a cell scraper, and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGE-PAL CA-630, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Whole cell lysates (20 μg for detection of human VCAM and 10 μg for detection of IκBα and DSCR-1) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience) using the semidry blotting method. The membrane was blocked with TBS-T containing 2% skim milk and incubated with primary antibodies against VCAM-1, IκBα, RelA (Santa Cruz), NFATc (Affinity Bioreagents), or DSCR-1 (we generated the monoclonal antibody using the DSCR-1, 94-197 amino acids fragment). The membrane was washed 3 times with TBS-T and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The signals were detected with WestDura SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). To control for loading, the membranes were stripped for 30 min at 55 °C with striping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol), washed with TBS-T, and re-probed using anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Monocyte Adhesion Assay—HUVEC were infected with adenovirus and seeded on 24-well tissue culture plates. After grown to confluence, HUVEC were incubated with EBM-2 containing 0.5% FBS for 18 h, then treated in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml VEGF and 2 units/ml thrombin for 6 h. U937 cells were labeled with red fluorescent dye using PKH-26 staining kit (Sigma), and a total of 3 × 105 cells was added to each well of a HUVEC-seeded 24-well plate. 90 min later cells were washed twice with Hanks'-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and examined by fluorescent microscopy. The adhesion intensities were measured with MetaMorph (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) and cell image analyzer (Kurabo, Tokyo, Japan). Identification of NFAT and NF-κB-dependent Pathways in Thrombin-treated Human Primary Endothelial Cells—In a previous study we demonstrated that thrombin and VEGF treatment of HUVEC resulted in marked and rapid up-regulation of the DSCR-1 gene and secondary inhibition of NFAT signaling (4.Minami T. Horiuchi K. Miura M. Abid M.R. Takabe W. Noguchi N. Kohro T. Ge X. Aburatani H. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Aird W.C. J. Biol.

Other studies have demonstrated an important role for NF-κB in thrombin-mediated gene expression (19.Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Minhajuddin M. Bijli K.M. Javaid K. True A.L. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol.

Res. 2002; 91: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine the relative contributions of these two signaling pathways (NFAT and NF-κB) and their respective endogenous inhibitors (DSCR-1 and IκB) in thrombin signaling, we carried out DNA microarray analysis of control or thrombin-treated HUVEC overexpressing EGFP (control), DSCR-1, or constitutively active IκBα. High transduction efficiency was confirmed using fluorescent microscopy, real-time PCR, and Western blots (Fig. 1A and data not shown). In duplicate arrays, thrombin induced a total of 172 genes more than 2-fold in Ad-Control-infected HUVEC, 52 and 59 of which were inhibited more than 40% by constitutive expression of DSCR-1 and CA-IκBα, respectively (see supplemental Table II for details). Clustering analyses revealed the existence of four groups of thrombin-inducible genes, namely those that were 1) reduced both by DSCR-1 and CA-IκBα (n = 19) (group 1), 2) reduced by DSCR-1 alone (n = 33) (group 2), 3) reduced by Ad-CA-IκBα (n = 35) (Group 3), and 4) unaffected by either inhibitor (group 4) (groups 1-3 are shown in Fig. 1B). Next, we employed real-time PCR to validate the results of two representative genes from each of the above groups. In group 1, thrombin treatment resulted in significant induction of the cell adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and E-selectin by 52-and 832-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 A and B) (a third adhesion molecule belonging to group 1 gene, VCAM-1, is discussed in detail below). Thrombin-mediated induction of ICAM-1 was inhibited 50% by overexpression of DSCR-1 and 87% by CA-IκBα. E-selectin up-regulation was inhibited 62% by the overexpression of DSCR-1 and 84% by CA-IκBα. As examples of group 2 genes, thrombin induced the expression of the calmodulin binding domain containing factor, caldesmon-1 (2.3-fold) (21.Mirzapoiazova T. Kolosova I.A. Romer L. Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 203: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the pro-angiogenic factor, Cyr 61 (2.1-fold) (22.Brigstock D.R. Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The effect of thrombin on caldesmon-1 and Cyr 61 was inhibited by Ad-DSCR-1 (46 and 53%, respectively) but not by Ad-CA-IκBα (Fig. 2, C and D). In group 3, thrombin stimulated the expression of inhibitors of programmed cell death, baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) repeat-containing-3 (40-fold) (23.Uren A.G. Pakusch M. Hawkins C.J. Puls K.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and A20 (7.0-fold) (24.Ferran C. Stroka D.M. Badrichani A.Z. Cooper J.T. Wrighton C.J. Soares M. Grey S.T. Bach F.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), effects that were attenuated by NF-κB blockade (84 and 67%, respectively) but not by DSCR-1 (Fig. 2, E and F). Thrombin-mediated Up-regulation of VCAM-1 mRNA and Protein in Human Primary Endothelial Cells Is Dependent on NFAT and NF-κB Activation Pathways—According to the DNA microarray data, VCAM-1 is contained within the Group 1 cluster. We have previously shown thrombin-mediated induction of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells involves the coordinate binding of NF-κB and GATA to tandem motifs in the upstream promoter region (25.Minami T. Abid M.R. Zhang J. King G. Kodama T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6976-6984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To confirm whether NF-κB and NFAT are also involved in thrombin stimulation of VCAM-1, we carried out real-time PCR of thrombin-stimulated HUVEC infected with Ad-Control, Ad-DSCR-1, and/or Ad-CA-IκBα. As shown in Fig. 3A, thrombin treatment resulted in 452-fold up-regulation of the VCAM-1 mRNA at 4 h, an effect that was inhibited by Ad-DSCR-1 and Ad-CA-IκBα (63 and 89%, respectively). Combined overexpression of DSCR-1 and CA-IκBα resulted in a nearly complete (97%) inhibition of the thrombin effect. Consistent with the effect of Ad-DSCR-1, overexpression of constitutive nuclear-localized NFAT (CA-NFAT) in HUVEC resulted in an 18-fold induction of VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Thrombin-mediated induction of endogenous VCAM-1 in HUVEC is mediated by NFAT and NF-κB. A, real-time PCR was performed with VCAM-1 specific primers using RNA from HUVEC infected with Ad-Control, Ad-DSCR-1, Ad-CA-IκBα, or both Ad-DSCR-1 and Ad-CA-IκBα. The results show the mean and S.D. of expression levels relative to cyclophilin A obtained in triplicate from at least three independent experiments. B, HUVEC were infected with either Ad-Control or Ad-CA-NFAT. Total RNA was harvested and processed for DNA microarrays. The results show the mean of the average differences obtained from two independent experiments. C-F, HUVEC were transfected with 40 nm siRNA against DSCR-1, treated in the absence or presence of thrombin, and assayed for DSCR-1 mRNA (C), DSCR-1 protein (D), VCAM-1 mRNA (E), and VCAM-1 protein (F). Real-time PCR and Western blot assays were used for measuring mRNA and protein levels, respectively. G-K, HUVEC were transfected with 40 nm siRNA against RelA (G, H, and K) or NFATc (I, J, and K), treated in the absence or presence of thrombin and assayed for RelA mRNA (G), RelA protein (H), NFATc mRNA (I), NFATc protein (J), and VCAM-1 mRNA (K). Western blot assays were used for measuring mRNA and protein levels, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we wished to determine the effect of DSCR-1 knockdown on VCAM-1 expression. To that end HUVEC were transfected with siRNA against DSCR-1. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, two independent siRNAs inhibited thrombin-stimulated DSCR-1 mRNA (87 and 69%, respectively) as well as DSCR-1 protein. Importantly, both siRNAs resulted in a super-induction of VCAM-1 mRNA and protein levels in thrombin-treated HUVEC (Fig. 3, E and F). Similarly, siRNAs against IκBα accentuated the effect of thrombin on VCAM-1 mRNA expression (supplemental Fig. I). In contrast, siRNA against RelA and NFATc (whose effectiveness in inhibiting their target genes is shown in Fig. 3, G-J) virtually abrogated thrombin-mediated induction of VCAM-1 mRNA (Fig. 3K). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that thrombin stimulation of VCAM-1 is mediated by RelA- and NFATc-dependent signaling pathways and that these pathways are in turn autoinhibited by IκBα and DSCR-1, respectively. Thrombin-mediated Up-regulation of VCAM-1 Promoter in Human Primary Endothelial Cells Is Dependent on NFAT and NF-κB Activation Pathways—To confirm the above results at the level of the VCAM-1 promoter, HUVEC were infected with Ad-Control, Ad-DSCR-1, Ad-CA-IκBα, or Ad-CA-NFAT and then transiently transfected with constructs containing the thymidine kinase promoter (control), the human VCAM-1 promoter (1800 bp 5′-flanking sequence), or the mouse VCAM-1 promoter (2500-bp 5′-flanking sequence) coupled to luciferase cDNA. In contrast to an absence of effect on the thymidine kinase promoter, overexpression of CA-NFAT resulted in a 3-fold induction of mouse and human VCAM-1 promoter activity (Fig. 4A). In co-transfection assays overexpression of NFATc or RelA resulted in a 1.67- and 24.5-fold induction of VCAM-1 promoter activity, respectively. Combined overexpression of NFATc and RelA had a synergistic effect on luciferase activity (42.1-fold induction) (Fig. 4B). Thrombin induced human VCAM-1 promoter activity by 4.5-fold, an effect inhibited by 64 and 92% in cells overexpressing DSCR-1 or CA-IκBα, respectively (Fig. 4C). Taken together with the results of DNA microarrays, real-time PCR, Western blots, and transient transfections, these data support a role for both NF-κB/IκBα and NFAT/DSCR-1 feedback pathways in the temporal regulation of VCAM-1 gene expression. NFAT Stimulation of the VCAM-1 Promoter Is Mediated by the NF-κB Motif—The human VCAM-1 promoter contains NFAT consensus motifs ((A/T)GGAAA) at -443, -251, and -216 relative to the transcriptional start site (Fig. 5). To determine whether one or more of these sites is required for NFAT-mediated transactivation of the VCAM-1 promoter, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were co-transfected with an NFATc expression plasmid (pCMV-NFATc) and VCAM-1 promoter-luciferase constructs containing various mutations/deletions. As shown in Fig. 5A, NFATc expression resulted in a 9-fold induction of the wild type promoter. This effect was unaltered by deletion of the 5′-most NFAT element (Δ-289-luc) or mutation of the -251 or -216 NFAT sites. In contrast, a promoter containing mutated NF-κB sites (NF-κB mut"

They act either as broad spectrum protein degraders or as sheddases, operating through limited proteolysis. Among the structurally uncharacterized metzincin families are the pappalysins, of which the most thoroughly studied member is human pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), a heavily glycosylated 170-kDa multidomain protein specifically cleaving insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding proteins (IGFBPs). Proulilysin is a 38-kDa archaeal protein that shares sequence similarity with PAPP-A but encompasses only the pro-domain and the catalytic domain. It undergoes calcium-mediated autolytic activation, and the mature protein adopts a three-dimensional structure with two subdomains separated by an active site cleft containing the catalytic zinc ion. This structure is reminiscent of human members of the adamalysin/ADAMs (a disintegrin and a metalloprotease) family of metzincins. A bound dipeptide yields information on the substrate specificity of ulilysin, which specifically hydrolyzes IGFBP-2 to -6, insulin, and extracellular matrix proteins but not IGFBP-1 or IGF-II.

Their activity is also correlated with several diseases, including atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer (1Bach L.A. Headey S.J. Norton R.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 228-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Most circulating IGF molecules are sequestered in complexes with soluble IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to -6) (2Zapf J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 132: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). IGFBPs antagonize binding of IGFs to their receptors because of their much higher affinity, and they are thus carriers, mediators, and reservoirs of IGFs (3Burger A.M. Leyland-Jones B. Banerjee K.

IGFs are released from these complexes with IGFBP through proteolytic inactivation mediated by IGFBP proteases, which include serine proteinases, cysteine proteinases, and metalloproteases (MPs). Among these, human PAPP-A specifically inactivates IGFBPs (4Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Hays L.G. Yates 3rd J.R. Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is ubiquitously expressed and plays central roles in ovarian follicular development, myogenesis, human embryo implantation, and wound healing (8Glerup S. Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T.

Mature PAPP-A is a glycosylated multidomain protein of 1,547 residues that specifically hydrolyzes human IGFBP-4 in an IGF-dependent manner.

In addition to its proteolytic domain, three Lin12-Notch repeats (LNR-1, -2, and -3), modules that regulate ligand-induced proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor, and five complement control protein modules (CCP1–5) have been identified (9Boldt H.B.

Currently, representative three-dimensional structures of six different proteinase families bearing this motif show, despite negligible sequence similarity, topological elements in common, among them a methionine-containing 1,4-β-turn called Met turn. These are the astacins, adamalysins/ADAMs, serralysins, matrixins, snapalysins, and leishmanolysins. These two features, the ZBCS and the Met turn, gave rise to the name of the clan. They are linked by variable connecting segments that are characteristic for each constituting family (11Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 12Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Rüth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Prot.

Interestingly, members of the adamalysin/ADAM (ADAM-9, -12, and -28) and the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) families (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -11, and -19) have been identified as IGFBP proteases (14Fang P.

Commun. 2005; 333: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These two latter families have previously been associated with the fate of other growth factors and derived pathologies. They mediate shedding of the ectodomains of membrane-anchored growth factors, cytokines, and receptors and thus increase their circulating forms (16Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar).We have identified a series of novel potential pappalysins through bioinformatic searches and studied a potential orthologue from Methanosarcina acetivorans (SwissProt protein sequence data base access code Q8TL28). This was the only archaeal form found, for which we hereby propose the name “ulilysin.” We present the molecular analysis of this fully functional prokaryotic protease and discuss its mechanism of activation, as well as implications for other members of the pappalysin family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Overexpression and Purification of M. acetivorans Ulilysin—A DNA fragment encoding the full-length 342-residue protein MA3214 (38-kDa proulilysin) was amplified from total genomic DNA of M. acetivorans strain C2A and cloned into expression vectors. Cysteine-to-alanine mutants were constructed, because the wild-type protein tended to form aggregates that hampered reproducibility in crystallization. With the mutation at position 269 (Fig. 1), crystallization was reproducible. This variant was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Star™ cells with plasmid pET-28a, which attaches an N-terminal His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site. A selenomethionine variant of proulilysin was obtained analogously, except that cells were grown in minimal medium containing selenomethionine and amino acids. The bacterial cell cultures were collected and centrifuged, the pellets were resuspended, and the cells were disrupted by means of a cell disruptor before centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to protein purification through nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, and the polyhistidine tag was removed with thrombin. The partially purified protein was further purified by anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. Fractions containing the tag-free 38-kDa proulilysin protein were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and subjected to final size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography. The central fractions of the peak were mixed and concentrated by centrifugal filter devices. The concentrated protein samples (5–20 mg/ml) were stored at 4 °C.Biochemical Studies in Vitro—If not otherwise stated, the proteolytic assays were performed at 38-kDa proulilysin and 29-kDa ulilysin concentrations of 0.45 and 0.65 mg/ml, respectively, in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 2–4 h and at (pro)protease:substrate weight ratios of 1:100 or 1:200. The proteolytic capacity of ulilysin was tested on several substrates (Table 1). For the collagen substrates the buffer was 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl. In the case of azosubstrates, absorbance was monitored at 440 nm. IGFBP-1 to -6 were tested at 1:300 and IGF-II at 1:100 at 20 °C for 4 h. Casein and gelatin zymography was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on precast Tris-Tricine Bio-Rad Ready Gels (with either 10% gelatin or 12% casein). The optimum pH for ulilysin activity was determined with the azocasein proteolysis assay (1:200) at 37 °C using 50 mm Bis-Tris (pH 5–7) or Hepes (pH 7–9). The same assay was used to study activation of proulilysin in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 (in 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6) and to assess inhibition by standard protease inhibitors and by synthetic small molecule MMP inhibitors (Table 2). The oligomerization state of proulilysin and ulilysin (at 0.5–1.8 mg/ml) in solution was assessed by size exclusion chromatography in a calibrated Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column. N-terminal Edman degradation, enzymatic digestion, and mass spectrometry analyses were performed in collaboration with the Proteomics Unit of the Technical and Scientific Service of the Barcelona Science Park and the Laboratory of Oncology (Vall d'Hebron Hospital, Barcelona, Spain).TABLE 1Substrates assayed for ulilysin activitySubstratesCleavageLimited proteolysisNatural proteinsHuman plasma α1-antitrypsin-Bovine muscle actin+YesCasein+NoBovine neck ligament elastin+NoBovine plasma fibronectin+NoHuman plasma fibrinogen+YesGelatin+NoHuman plasma plasmin-Labeled proteinsAzoalbumin-Azocasein+NoAzocoll+NoCollagensCollagen type I, human placenta-Collagen type I, kangaroo tail+NoCollagen type IV, calf skin-Collagen type V, human+NoplacentaIGF axis proteinsIGF-II-IGFBP-1-IGFBP-2+YesIGFBP-3+YesIGFBP-4+YesIGFBP-5+YesIGFBP-6+Yesinsulin chain B+Yes Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Inhibition studies of ulilysinInhibitorInhibitor concentrationInhibitor specificityResidual activity%Control100Bovine lung aprotinin0.3 μmSerine proteases93Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride1 mmSerine and cysteine proteases87Iodoacetamide1 mmCysteine proteases103E-6410 mmCysteine proteases95Pepstatin A1 mmAspartic proteases92Phosphoramidon10 μmMMPs (thermolysin-like)1071,10-Phenanthroline5 mmMMPs2EDTA5 mmMMPs6ZnCl25 mmMMPs11CT17461 mmMMPs57409.11 mmMMPs87Galardine1 mmMMPs88Batimastat1 mmMMPs24RXP03-R11 mmMMPs92Captopril1 mmMMPs (angiotensin converting enzyme)78l-Arginine5 mm76Guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid1 mm/10 mmMetallocarboxypeptidases of type B99/55Benzamidine5 mmSerine proteases and metallocarboxypeptidases of type B40 Open table in a new tab Crystallization of Ulilysin, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Orthorhombic P21212 crystals with two molecules in the asymmetric unit were obtained from sitting drops consisting of full-length C269A 38-kDa proulilysin (5 mg/ml in 30 mm Tris·HCl pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl) and reservoir solution (18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 m CaCl2) after several weeks at 20 °C. Mass spectrometry analysis and N-terminal sequencing of the crystallized protein revealed a molecular mass of 28,885 ± 50 Da and that the N terminus started at position Arg61, thus corresponding to activated 29-kDa ulilysin. The crystal structure was solved employing the selenomethionine derivative that crystallized in the same conditions as the native protein. A three-wavelength multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment was carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility Beamline BM16 (Grenoble, France). Furthermore, a high resolution data set was collected from the same crystal. Diffraction data were collected on an MAR CCD detector and processed with MOSFLM (17Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar); they were then scaled, reduced, and merged with SCALA (18Evans P. Data Collection and Processing: Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. 1993; (January, 29–30, 1993 (Sawyer, L., Isaacs, N., and Bailey, S., eds) pp. , SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington): 114-122Google Scholar) within the CCP4 suite (19Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar) (Table 3). The multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction data enabled identification of 10 of the 12 selenium sites present (6/monomer) with XPREP/SHELXD (20Sheldrick G.M. Hauptmann H.A. Weeks C.M. Miller R.

These phases gave rise to interpretable electron density maps. Subsequently, manual model building using TURBO-Frodo (22Carranza C. Inisan A.-G. Mouthuy-Knoops E. Cambillau C. Roussel A.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar) within CCP4, until the final model was obtained. This model contains protein residues Arg61–Ala322. Furthermore, one zinc (Zn999) and two calcium cations (Ca998 and Ca997) were assigned to each molecule present in the asymmetric unit based on the ion coordination spheres and distance and geometry of the ligands. Comparable B-factors to the bound atoms and absence of positive or negative difference electron density after crystallographic refinement further supported this assignment, as well as the requirement of both zinc and calcium for activity. All of the protein residues were found in the most favored and additionally allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot. Each polypeptide chain displayed one disulfide bond (Cys250–Cys277). 587 solvent molecules (Hoh7W–Hoh604W), a fifth calcium cation engaged in crystal contacts (Ca1W), and six (tentatively assigned) glycerol molecules (Gol2W–Gol7W) were also identified in the structure. Finally, a dipeptide was found (Arg401-Val402) in each of the two active sites.TABLE 3Crystallographic statistics on data collection and refinementData setUlilysin C269A SeMet derivative (high resolution)Space groupP21212Cell constants (a, b, c; in Å)49.6, 126.1, 87.4Wavelength (Å)0.9840No. of measurements362,539No. of unique reflections61,061Resolution range (Å) (outermost shell)39.0-1.70 (1.79-1.70)aFigures in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell, unless otherwise indicated.Completeness (%)99.8 (99.9)RmergebRmerge = ΣhklΣi |Ii(hkl) – 〈I(hkl) 〉/ΣhklΣi Ii(hkl), where Ii(hkl) is the ith intensity measurement of reflection hkl, including symmetry-related reflections, and 〈I(hkl) 〉 is its average.0.082 (0.438)Average intensity (〈[〈I 〉/σ(〈I 〉)] 〉)11.6 (3.4)B-factor (Wilson) (Å2)17.9Average multiplicity5.9 (5.7)Resolution range used for refinement (Å)32.1-1.70No. of reflections used (test set)60,401 (610)Crystallographic Rfactor (free Rfactor)cRfactor = Σhkl ||Fobs| – k|Fcalc||/Σhkl|Fobs|, with Fobs and Fcalc as the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes.

Accordingly, discussion will focus on molecule A. The figures were prepared with TURBO-Frodo and MOLSCRIPT (24Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Structural superimpositions were performed with TURBO-Frodo. Bioinformatic amino acid sequence similarity searches were undertaken within MEROPS data base (merops.sanger.ac.uk) and with the servers ProDom (protein.toulouse.inra.fr/prodom.html), Pfam (www.sanger.ac.uk/software/pfam), and PSI-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). For the last server, the sequence of PAPP-A shown in Fig. 1, which includes the putative MP region, was employed as bait after exclusion of the two LNR regions. Structural similarity searches were performed with the DALI server (www.ebi.ac.uk/msd). Multiple sequence alignments were calculated with MULTALIN (prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin). Close contacts and interaction surfaces were calculated with the program CNS (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The final coordinates of ulilysin have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank at Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (www.rcsb.org/pdb) with access code 2cki.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAutolytic Activation of Ulilysin Is Mediated by Calcium—Both the full-length protein of 38 kDa and its selenomethionine variant are monomeric in solution and, once purified, stable over weeks, with no traces of degradation even at 37 °C (Fig. 2A). However, the addition of calcium causes a band of 29 kDa to appear in both cases (Fig. 2B). The full-length protein is inactive (see below and Fig. 2C), but preincubation with calcium renders activity after an initial lag phase. In turn, the 29-kDa form, which is also monomeric, is highly active. The full-length protein crystallizes in the presence of a high concentration of CaCl2. N-terminal Edman degradation and mass spectrometry analyses of the crystalline material reveal that it contains segment Arg61–Ala322 (Fig. 1), revealing that the full-length protein was cleaved twice before crystal-lizing. The amino acid sequence around these two cleavage sites shows a similar motif, with an arginine in the P1′ position, the first position downstream of the scissile bond (nomenclature according to Ref. 26Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4727) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 2E). These data indicate that the 38-kDa form is the inactive zymogen, proulilysin, which undergoes calcium-triggered autoactivation to the 29-kDa form, mature ulilysin. Autolytic activation entails removal of the first 60 residues, which would correspond to the pro-domain, and of a highly charged, 20-residue C-terminal tail that contains five glutamate and six arginine/lysine residues. Within the pro-domain, a potentially free cysteine (Cys23; Fig. 1) could play the role of a “cysteine switch” or “Velcro” element, where the cysteine Sγ atom coordinates the catalytic zinc ion in the zymogen and prevents substrates from binding to the active site. Such mechanisms for the maintenance of latency have been described in other metzincins (13Gomis-Rüth F.X. Mol. Biotech. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 27Springman E.B.

Furthermore, IGFBP-4 and -5 proteolysis occurred more efficiently in vitro than when mediated by human PAPP-A and PAPP-A2. Ulilysin produced comparable cleavage levels at much lower doses and reaction times than the human enzymes, as inferred from SDS-PAGE (data not shown). In addition, ulilysin had an optimum pH of around 6 and performed limited proteolysis of a whole series of substrates, including casein and extracellular matrix (derived) components like azocollagen, gelatin, and fibronectin (Table 1). Natural collagens of type I from kangaroo tail and of type V were also cleaved, but not collagen type I from human placenta or collagen type IV. However, these results must be taken with care as cleavage occurred at 37 °C but not at room temperature. Furthermore, these substrates were also cleaved by trypsin in the same conditions, thus indicating that the purchased samples contained gelatinous material. In this context, it is noteworthy that extracellular matrix components interact with IGFBP-5 and modulate its activity in vivo (1Bach L.A. Headey S.J. Norton R.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 228-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, the rather proteolysis-resistant skeletal proteins actin and elastin were also cleaved, as was fibrinogen from the blood coagulation cascade, but not plasmin or α1-antitrypsin. N-terminal sequence analyses of the major fragments obtained after proteolysis of insulin and fibrinogen confirms the specificity for arginine in P1′ (Fig. 2E), as already suggested by the autolytic cleavage points, and that the enzyme has a substrate preference with the pattern BX↓RB(E/Q) (B, bulky hydrophobic or aromatic).Ulilysin was only inhibited by unspecific MP inhibitors like the zinc chelators o-phenanthroline and EDTA, and by excess zinc (Table 2). Partial inhibition was only effected by batimastat and CT1746, which are broad spectrum small molecule inhibitors of MMPs. The preference for an arginine in the P1′ position also led us to test l-arginine and two arginine-based molecules that inhibit serine proteases and carboxypeptidases, benzamidine, and guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid. None of them caused significant inhibition. These data indicate that ulilysin is both a specific and an efficient metalloprotease that targets selected IGFBPs and extracellular matrix proteins and that selective inhibitors remain to be found.Overall Structure of Ulilysin—Ulilysin is ellipsoidal, with an α/β topology within a polypeptide chain that runs from residue Arg61 to Ala322 (Fig. 3, a and b). The protein is partitioned into two moieties separated by an extended active site cleft running from left to right, namely an upper regular N-terminal subdomain (NTSD; Arg61–Asn235) and a rather irregular C-terminal lower domain (CTSD; Leu236–Ala322). NTSD starts on the back of the molecule and enters, through strand β1, a strongly twisted, mainly parallel five-stranded β-sheet (Figs. 3a and 4A). Following β1, helix α1 runs on the back of the molecule from the upper right to the lower left and finishes at the junction with the CTSD. Here, the polypeptide chain follows an extended loop (Lys100–Gly120) whose tip almost reaches the bottom of the molecule, resembling a cape over the back of the CTSD. This segment features two short 310-helices (α2 and α3 in Figs. 3a and 4A). The peptide chain rejoins the NTSD at the second β-strand that is subdivided into two, named β2 and β3. They are separated by an insertion (Thr127–Thr136), here termed the “LNR-like loop,” located on the convex side of the β-sheet and jutting out from the molecular surface (Fig. 3a). After β3, the protein chain spanning residues Ser144–Tyr170 runs back over the convex surface of the sheet in an irregular manner and rejoins the β-sheet at β4. Of particular importance here is a double main chain to side chain interaction performed by Trp165 with Asn172, which anchors the long β3β4-connecting segment or loop (Lβ3β4) to the molecular scaffold. At the end of β4, the chain leads to a small β-ribbon, also on the convex side of the sheet, constituted by strands β5 and β6. Thereafter, the chain enters the outermost strand of the sheet, β7, the only one that runs antiparallel. After a bulky protrusion created by the connecting loop (Lβ7β8), the chain enters β8, whic"
https://openalex.org/W2119579078,"p94/calpain 3 is a skeletal muscle-specific member of the Ca2+-regulated cytosolic cysteine protease family, the calpains. Defective p94 protease activity originating from gene mutations causes a muscular dystrophy called calpainopathy, indicating the indispensability of p94 for muscle survival. Because of the existence of the p94-specific regions IS1 and IS2, p94 undergoes very rapid and exhaustive autolysis. To elucidate the physiological relevance of this unique activity, the autolytic profiles of p94 and the effect of the p94 binding protein, connectin/titin, on this process were investigated. In vitro analysis of p94 autolysis showed that autolysis in IS1 proceeds without immediate disassembly into fragments and that the newly identified cryptic autolytic site in IS2 is critical for disassembling autolyzed fragments. As a genetic system to assay p94 autolysis semiquantitatively, p94 was expressed in yeast as a hybrid protein between the DNA binding and activation domains of the yeast transcriptional activator Gal4. Transcriptional activation by the Gal4-p94:WT hybrid protein is precluded by p94 autolysis. Complete or partial loss of autolytic activity by C129S active site mutation, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A pathogenic missense mutations, or PCR-based random mutagenesis could be detected by semiquantitative restoration of Gal4-dependent β-galactosidase gene expression. Using this system, the N2A connectin fragment that binds to p94 was shown to suppress p94 autolytic disassembly. The proximity of the IS2 autolytic and connectin-binding sites in p94 suggested that N2A connectin suppresses IS2 autolysis.

Calpains (named after the first discovered and best characterized member, Ca2+-dependent and papain-like protease, EC 3.4.22.18, clan CA, family C2) correspond to a diverse gene family whose members all share the characteristic “calpain protease domain” and comprise a unique branch of the cysteine proteases (1Suzuki K.

Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). To date, calpains have been identified in many different mammalian tissues and in almost all types of living organism (3Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Studies on calpain protease activity, from enzymatic characterization to clarification of its roles in cellular phenomena, have mainly advanced knowledge of the conventional calpains, the μ- and m-calpains. These ubiquitously expressed calpains can be conveniently assayed in vitro using established and reproducible methods, such as casein hydrolysis assay, facilitating development of more specific inhibitors as well as more sensitive substrates. In contrast, the skeletal muscle-specific calpain, p94/calpain 3, has remained poorly characterized with regard to its protease activity. The expression of p94 predominates over other calpain species in skeletal muscle, and a defect in p94 proteolytic activity originating from gene mutations causes muscular dystrophy (4Sorimachi H.

In this context, p94 exemplifies the critical importance of tissue-specific calpain species that must fulfill unique functions, thereby necessitating an innovative approach to investigate. One characteristic of p94 is its very rapid and exhaustive autolytic activity, making it unfeasible to carry out in vitro activity assays using purified p94 protein (7Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we took advantage of the relatively stable nature of one of the splice variants of p94, p94Δ, determined enzymatic profiles, protease inhibitor sensitivity in vitro, and found that calpastatin, an endogenous inhibitor protein specific to calpains, is a substrate for p94 (8Ono Y.

Another group has also shown that the bacterially expressed protease core of p94 serves as a useful enzyme source for in vitro kinetic analysis (9Rey M.A. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Diaz B.G. Moldoveanu T. Kuiper M.J. Campbell R.L. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27656-27666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a clan of alternatively spliced forms of p94, which is expressed in rodent lenses, was also shown to be useful for in vitro enzymatic study (11Fukiage C. Nakajima E. Ma H. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20678-20685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Together, these data strongly attribute the apparent autocatalytic instability of p94 to IS1 and IS2. There is an interesting discrepancy between recombinantly expressed p94 protein and native p94 protein in skeletal muscle. Although too unstable to completely purify (12Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Amano S. Kawasaki H. Kolmerer B. Kimura S. Labeit S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the full-length p94 protein can be detected in freshly prepared skeletal muscle homogenates (13Kramerova I. Kudryashova E. Tidball J.G. Spencer M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1373-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Anderson L.V. Davison K. Moss J.A. Richard I. Fardeau M. Tome F.M. Hubner C. Lasa A. Colomer J. Beckmann J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) in contrast to recombinantly expressed p94, which is mainly detected as autolyzed fragments (7Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is predicted that skeletal muscle cells keep p94 from undergoing autolysis constitutively or randomly. One of the candidate molecules regulating p94 stability is connectin/titin, a gigantic sarcomeric protein in striated muscle. In both skeletal and cardiac muscles, a single connectin molecule extends from the Z-line to the M-line and therefore spans the entire half-sarcomeric distance of more than 1 mm. Previously, our yeast two-hybrid studies showed that p94 binds to two distinct regions, the N2A and C terminus regions, of connectin, which are located in the sarcomeric N2- and M-lines, respectively (15Kinbara K. Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); “A” in N2A represents a splice variant predominant in skeletal muscle. In accordance with this, p94 has been immunolocalized to the N2- and M-line regions in the skeletal muscle sarcomere (17Keira Y. Noguchi S. Minami N. Hayashi Y.K. Nishino I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of p94 from skeletal muscle present features of connectin-bound proteins (i.e. p94 is enriched in the connectin-rich saline-insoluble fraction). Isolation of p94 from this myofibril fraction provokes rapid autolysis and disappearance of full-length p94 protein (12Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Amano S. Kawasaki H. Kolmerer B. Kimura S. Labeit S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It was recently established that an in-frame deletion in the connectin N2A region causes a recessively inherited severe muscular dystrophy in mice: muscular dystrophy with myositis, mdm (18Garvey S.M. Rajan C. Lerner A.P. Frankel W.N. Cox G.A. Genomics. 2002; 79: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The deletion caused by mdm results in a loss of p94-interacting activity of N2A connectin in the yeast two-hybrid system, and the amount of p94 protein shows a tendency to decrease in mdm/mdm skeletal muscle (19Haravuori H. Vihola A. Straub V. Auranen M. Richard I. Marchand S. Voit T. Labeit S. Somer H. Peltonen L. Beckmann J.S. Udd B. Neurology. 2001; 56: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Witt C.C.

Biol. 2004; 336: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Together, these observations support the hypothesis that binding to connectin is related to p94 stability. However, the actual interaction between p94 and the N2A connectin fragment has not yet been studied under the physiological context. Therefore, the significance of the interaction between p94 and N2A connectin and of the loss of interaction between p94 and mdm-type N2A connectin requires further investigation. The focus of this study was to monitor the autolytic activity of p94 and to evaluate the factor(s) affecting this activity. We used the yeast transcriptional activator Gal4 system, which was originally described as “proteinase trapping” (21Liebig H.D. Skern T. Luderer M. Sommergruber W. Blaas D. Kuechler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5979-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), to measure the autocatalytic activity of several viral proteases such as the 3C protease of coxsackievirus B3, the 2A protease of poliovirus, and the human immunodeficiency virus protease (22Dautin N. Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7060-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Barco A. Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 4159-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In our system, suppression of p94 autolytic activity was detected as an increase in transcriptional activation using a hybrid protein of two functional domains of Gal4 (Gal4bd and Gal4ad) linked by p94. This is the first example in which a mammalian protease is applied to proteinase trapping. Using this methodology in combination with other in vitro analyses has been beneficial in revealing the autolytic processes of p94. This genetic system also could be used for examining the effect of wild type and mdm-type connectin fragments on p94 autolysis and profiling structure-function relationships underlying autolytic/protease activity unique to p94. cDNA Constructs—The cDNAs for human and mouse p94/calpain 3 were kind gifts from Drs. Muriel Herasse and Isabelle Richard. The cDNA corresponding to the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (AD) of Gal4 was isolated from pACT2, a yeast expression vector provided in the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (Clontech), and was subcloned into pAS2–1C, which encodes the Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD), in tandem with human p94, resulting in the BD-p94-AD-expressing vector. Human connectin cDNA clones CN48 and CN52, encoding N2A and C-terminal regions of connectin, respectively, have been reported previously (16Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S.

The mouse cDNA corresponding to the human connectin CN48 clone (nucleotides 28858–29769 of NM_133378) was amplified by PCR from mouse skeletal muscle cDNA using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/N-FLAG, and the yeast expression vectors pAS2-1C, p415GPD, and p425GPD have been described elsewhere (25Sato N. Kawahara H. Toh-e A. Maeda T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Human and mouse p94 cDNAs were constructed into pSRD for protein expression under the SRα promoter, as previously described (6Ono Y. Shimada H. Sorimachi H. Richard I. Saido T.C. Beckmann J.S.

Mouse p94 (wild type or a splice variant without exon 6) was also tagged with tandem Myc and His6 epitopes at the C terminus. Mutagenesis using long PCR with Pfu or Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerases was performed to introduce all of the mutations, as previously described (6Ono Y. Shimada H. Sorimachi H. Richard I. Saido T.C.

Enzymes used for manipulating recombinant DNA were purchased from Takara Bio (Kyoto, Japan) or New England Biolabs. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast Transformation and Assay for Reporter Gene Expression—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains AH109 and CG1945 were transformed using the Fast™-Yeast Transformation Kit (Gene Technology), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Transformants were selected on plates with SD medium that lacked Trp (SD–W), or SD–LW. The expression of reporter genes HIS3, ADE2, or both was assessed by colony growth of AH109 on SD–LWH, SD–LWA, or SD–LWHA plates, respectively. Expression of the reporter gene lacZ was evaluated using CG1945 by liquid culture assay for β-galactosidase activity using ONPG as a substrate. All of the procedures were carried out following Ref. 37Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. 2001; (Publication PT3024-1, Clontech, Mountain View, CA)Google Scholar with some modifications. One unit of β-galactosidase activity corresponds to 1 mmol of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolyzed per min at 30 °C. The amount of yeast cells per reaction and the reaction time were adjusted so that the measured A420 value remained within the linear range of the assay. Random Mutagenesis by PCR—Random mutations were introduced using human wild type p94 cDNA and the primers 5′-ATA CAT ATG CCG ACC GTC ATT AGC GC-3′ and 5′-ATG TTG ATG TAG GTT TTG CTC C-3′, which correspond to NS and domain III of p94. The reaction was performed in 50 μl of the solution (0.2 mm dGTP, 1 mm dATP/dCTP/dTTP, 400 nm each primer, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2 in 1× rTaq buffer (Takara Bio)) with 50 ng of template DNA (human wild type p94 cDNA) and 1.25 units of rTaq using the following cycles: 94 °C for 5 min; 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 120 s × 25 cycles; 72 °C for 7 min. However, these conditions turned out to be too mutation-prone, and in the second set of experiments, the reaction was performed under “normal” PCR conditions (i.e. in 50 μl of the solution (0.2 mm dGTP/dATP/dCTP/dTTP, 500 nm each primer in 1× ExTaq buffer containing 2 mm Mg+ (Takara Bio)) with 50 ng of template DNA and 1.25 units of ExTaq (Takara Bio) using the same cycles as above. The mutagenized cDNA fragments (20 μg) were cotransformed with 20 μg of the 6.7-kb Tth111I-PshAI fragment of the BD-p94-AD expression vector into AH109 to cause in vivo ligation by homologous recombination, as previously described (27Longtine M.S.

About 2 × 106 transformants were screened on selection medium plates, SD–WHA, yielding about 3,400 colonies. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these colonies, and mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. In Vitro Autolytic Assay Using Recombinant Protein—Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf-9) were generously provided by Dr. Takeshi Nishino (Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant p94:C129S and p94Δ were expressed and purified as previously described (8Ono Y. Kakinuma K. Torii F. Irie A. Nakagawa K. Labeit S. Abe K. Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. J. Biol.

N-terminally His-tagged p94:N358D was expressed in the Sf-9/baculovirus system in the same manner and purified using a His-Bind Quick 900 Ni2+ affinity column cartridge (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 × 107 infected Sf-9 cells were homogenized by sonication in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After supercentrifugation, the supernatant was applied to the His-Bind Quick 900 cartridge preequilibrated with 1 mm His in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The cartridge was washed with 10 ml of 1 mm His in buffer A and eluted with 2.5 ml of 0.2 m His in buffer A. The eluent was immediately desalted by applying it to a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and used for experiments within a few days. Protease-inactive p94:C129S (final 1 mg/ml) and the splice variant p94Δ were mixed at a molar ratio of 10:1 and incubated at 37 °C for up to 240 min. The assay solution contained 0.1 m Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 25 mm Ca2+. Autolysis of p94:N358D was performed by incubating it in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 10 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone at 37 °C (p94:N358D protein, final 10 μg/ml). The reaction was terminated at the indicated times by the addition of 5 × sample buffer followed by a 5-min incubation at 95 °C. The 0-min sample was constituted by adding each component into a tube that already contained sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and Native PAGE Analyses—Proteolytic fragments were subjected to SDS-PAGE or native PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and Western blotting. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the standard Laemmli method using 10% gels. Native PAGE analysis was carried out essentially in the same manner but without SDS and electrophoresed by a constant current, 5–10 mA at 4 °C. Scanned images of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels were converted for densitometric evaluation. The outline of each band was defined by the sharpness of the contrast against background. The amount of protein in each band was represented by volume OD and normalized against the value at 0 min of incubation set to 1. Protein Expression in COS7 Cells for Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum heat inactivated prior to use (56 °C, 30 min). Electroporation was performed using a Bio-Rad gene pulser, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 72 h after electroporation and sonicated in a solution consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, as previously described (6Ono Y. Shimada H.

After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Tokyo, Japan), which were then probed with appropriate primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies followed by visualization using a POD immunostaining kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). For immunoprecipitation, cells transfected with expression constructs for mouse p94 with or without a C-terminal Myc-His tag were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA-K, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors as follows: 1.5 μm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, 50 μm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 2 mm iodoacetoamide. After 30 min on ice with occasional tapping, the lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation using anti-pIS2 or anti-Myc antibodies. The antibodies used in this study included a p94-specific anti-pIS2 antibody raised in goat against the epitope identical to the one used for the previously described anti-pKrich (7Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol.

An anti-p94-C terminus antibody was elicited using C-NVLEWLQLTMYA, corresponding to the C terminus of rat p94, conjugated to KLH. Interaction of Autolyzed p94 Fragments—The autolysis of p94 was reconstituted in vitro by mixing p94:C129S and p94Δ, a splicing variant that lacks IS1 and IS2 (8Ono Y. Kakinuma K. Torii F. Irie A. Nakagawa K. Labeit S. Abe K. Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2761-2771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in a ratio of 10:1. Previously, it was shown that p94Δ recapitulates the substrate specificity of p94 and retains autolytic activity toward p94:129S, albeit Ca2+-dependently (8Ono Y. Kakinuma K. Torii F. Irie A. Nakagawa K. Labeit S. Abe K. Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2761-2771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The condition used here allows the detection of the autolyzed fragments from p94: C129S generated by “intermolecular autolytic” activity of p94Δ (8Ono Y. Kakinuma K. Torii F. Irie A. Nakagawa K. Labeit S. Abe K. Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2761-2771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In SDS-PAGE analysis, a slight mobility shift of p94:C129S was detected after 15 min of incubation in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1B, open and closed arrowheads); it is caused by very rapid cleavages at the N terminus (Fig. 1A, arrows (1)). Subsequently, 55-kDa and additional smaller autolyzed fragments were generated (Fig. 1B, arrows) (16Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Since N-terminal cleavages do not impair the proteolytic activity of p94Δ (8Ono Y. Kakinuma K. Torii F. Irie A. Nakagawa K. Labeit S. Abe K. Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2761-2771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it was assumed that both the full-length and N-terminally clipped populations of p94:C129S (Fig. 1B, open and closed arrowheads, respectively) represent structures of protease-active p94 species. The same set of samples was analyzed by native PAGE to examine the change of molecular conformation. After 15 min of incubation, p94: C129S slightly shifted toward the lower end of the gel (Fig. 1C, CS+Δ, lanes 15′ to 240′, open and closed arrowheads). This mobility shift most probably reflects the N-terminal cleavage detected in Fig. 1B (open and closed arrowheads), because incubation of p94:C129S alone did not cause a significant change in mobility or signal intensity (Fig. 1C, CS), and the mobility of p94Δ does not overlap with that of p94:C129S in native PAGE (Fig. 1C, arrows). By size exclusion chromatography, we have previously shown the possibility that purified recombinant p94:C129S forms a homodimer (12Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Amano S. Kawasaki H. Kolmerer B. Kimura S. Labeit S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The bands detected by the native PAGE may correspond to p94: C129S homodimer. It is not likely, however, that the observed mobility shift of p94:C129S is caused by monomer-dimer conversion, since the shift is probably too small for the change of molecular mass between 94 kDa (monomer) and 188 kDa (dimer). The sum of the full-length and N-terminally clipped fragments detected by SDS-PAGE was compared with those detected by native PAGE by densitometry (Fig. 1D). When the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, the rapid decline was observed (t½ = about 140 min; Fig. 1D, closed circles). In native PAGE analysis, however, more than 60% of the initial density was maintained for up to 4 h (Fig. 1D, open circles). Western blot analysis with an anti-pIS2 or C-terminal antibody following SDS- or native PAGE showed the same trend (i.e. slower decrease of the signal intensity for the full-length and the N-terminally cleaved p94: C129S under nondenaturing conditions) (Fig. 1, B and C, anti-pIS2 and C-terminal, respectively). These observations indicate that intermolecular autolytic cleavages of p94 do not simultaneously generate separate autolyzed fragments and that these fragments maintain their initial intramolecular interaction for more than twice the time predicted by SDS-PAGE analysis. This population of autolyzed p94 might be described as “IS1-nicked” molecules, because the 55-kDa fragment detected in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, top arrow) corresponds to the C-terminal product generated by autolysis in IS1 (Fig. 1A, arrows (2)). A Cryptic Autolytic Site of p94 near the N2A Connectin Binding Region—In the COS7 cell expression system, the amount of wild type p94 detected as the 55-kDa fragment is considerably smaller than that of the 94-kDa fragment for the protease-inactive p94:C129S mutant (Fig. 2A, WT and CS). This observation indicates that NS and IS1 are dominant but not the only sites for autolysis and that wild type p94 further undergoes au"
https://openalex.org/W2160063982,"Nicotine reduces beta-amyloidosis and has a beneficial effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanism is not clear. The abnormal interactions of beta-amyloid (Abeta) with metal ions such as copper and zinc are implicated in the process of Abeta deposition in AD brains. In the present study, we investigated the effect of nicotine on metal homeostasis in the hippocampus and cortex of APP(V717I) (London mutant form of APP) transgenic mice. A significant reduction in the metal contents of copper and zinc in senile plaques and neuropil is observed after nicotine treatment. The densities of copper and zinc distributions in a subfield of the hippocampus CA1 region are also reduced after nicotine treatment. We further studied the mechanism of nicotine-mediated effect on metal homeostasis by using SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the Swedish mutant form of human APP (APPsw). Nicotine treatment decreases the intracellular copper concentration and attenuates Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity facilitated by the addition of copper, and these effects are independent of the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine-receptor. These data suggest that the effect of nicotine on reducing beta-amyloidosis is partly mediated by regulating metal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2064752762,"MT1-MMP is a key enzyme in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The activity of cellular MT1-MMP is regulated by furin-like proprotein convertases, TIMPs, shedding, autoproteolysis, dimerization, exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling. Our data demonstrate that, in addition to these already known mechanisms, MT1-MMP is regulated by O-glycosylation of its hinge region. Insignificant autolytic degradation is characteristic for naturally expressed, glycosylated, MT1-MMP. In turn, extensive autolytic degradation, which leads to the inactivation of the protease and the generation of its C-terminal membrane-tethered degraded species, is a feature of overexpressed MT1-MMP. We have determined that incomplete glycosylation stimulates extensive autocatalytic degradation and self-inactivation of MT1-MMP. Self-proteolysis commences during the secretory process of MT1-MMP through the cell compartment to the plasma membrane. The strongly negatively charged sialic acid is the most important functional moiety of the glycopart of MT1-MMP. We hypothesize that sialic acid of the O-glycosylation cassette restricts the access of the catalytic domain to the hinge region and to the autolytic cleavage site and protects MT1-MMP from autolysis. Overall, our results point out that there is a delicate balance between glycosylation and self-proteolysis of MT1-MMP in cancer cells and that when this balance is upset the catalytically potent MT1-MMP pool is self-proteolyzed.

Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J. APMIS. 1999; 107: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Because the prodomain part of MT1-MMP has the furin-cleavage motif, furin and related proprotein convertases (PCs) are the physiological activators of latent MT1-MMP (13Kang T. Nagase H. Pei D.

Proteolytic processing by the PCs leads to the activation of the latent MT1-MMP zymogen, which occurs primarily in the trans-Golgi network during the secretory passage of MT1-MMP (30Pei D. Weiss S.J.

The levels of expression of naturally synthesized, cell surface-associated, MT1-MMP are quite low, normally in the range of 100,000–200,000 sites/cell (34Rozanov D.V. Savinov A.Y. Golubkov V.S.

These low expression levels make it difficult to characterize the biochemical and functional parameters of the protease. In most of the earlier studies involving MT1-MMP, the levels of cellular MT1-MMP were increased by transfecting the cells, either transiently or stably, with the MT1-MMP gene with the result that MT1-MMP was overexpressed (6Hernandez-Barrantes S.

An analysis of the peptide sequence of MT1-MMP (GenBank™ P50281), using the NetOGlyc and NetNGlyc software (www.cbs.dtu.dk), suggests that the proline-rich hinge region of MT1-MMP exhibits five potential O-glycosylation sites at Thr291, Thr299, Thr300, Ser301, and Ser304. Wu et al. (39Wu Y.I. Munshi H.G. Sen R. Snipas S.J. Salvesen G.S. Fridman R. Stack M.S. J. Biol.

In this report, we reinvestigate the roles of glycosylation and of the furin-mediated processing in the autolytic degradation of cellular MT1-MMP. Our experimental data provide evidence that glycosylation plays a significant role in regulating the sensitivity of MT1-MMP to self-proteolysis. We conclude that in multiple cancer cell types glycosylation and self-proteolysis of MT1-MMP co-exist in a delicate balance and that an aberration of this fine balance by overexpressing the protease results in its extensive degradation and self-inactivation. Antibodies and General Reagents—The reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. GM6001 (a subnanomolar range hydroxamate inhibitor of MT1-MMP), TIMP-2, the MT1-MMP antibody AB815 and a TMB/M substrate were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (dec-RVKR-cmk; a nanomolar range inhibitor of PCs), and protease inhibitor mixture set III were obtained from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA) and Calbiochem, respectively.

The corresponding control cells were each transfected with the original pcDNA3-zeo plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) without the MT1-MMP insert (mock cells). The catalytically inactive MT1-MMP mutant (MT-E240A) was generated by replacing the essential Glu-240 of the enzyme active site with Ala. MCF7 cells which stably express MT-E240A were described earlier (36Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol.

Glioma U251 cells (U-MT/PDX cells), co-expressing MT1-MMP with α1-antitrypsin Portland (PDX), were isolated and described in our previous work (45Golubkov V.S. Boyd S. Savinov A.Y. Chekanov A.V.

To facilitate the isolation of cellular MT1-MMP, the MT1-MMP-His-tagged construct (MT-His) was created by inserting the (His-His)5 tag between the C-terminal Val582 and the stop codon. The MT-His construct was next recloned on the pcDNA3-zeo vector. Breast carcinoma MCF7 cells were transfected with the MT-His construct using Lipofectamine and selected by Western blot analysis from the antibiotic-resistant clones. The expression of the MT-His construct was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunostaining analyses of MCF-MT-His cells. Deglycosylation of MT1-MMP—Cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and gentamicin (10 μg/ml). In the deglycosylation experiments, cells were incubated for 24 h with 2 mm benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (BGN) alone to inhibit O-glycosylation of MT1-MMP and then co-incubated for an additional 24 h with BGN and GM6001 (25 μm). MMP-2 Activation Assays—Cells were seeded in wells of a 12-well plate containing 1 ml DMEM-10% FBS (5 × 104 cells/well). In 24 h, cells were replenished with fresh serum-free DMEM (0.8 ml/well) and incubated for an additional 18–24 h. The medium was next separated from the cells by centrifugation. Medium aliquots (10 μl) were analyzed by gelatin zymography to detect gelatinolytic activity of the 68-kDa proenzyme, the 64-kDa activation intermediate, and the 62-kDa mature enzyme of MMP-2 (46Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were incubated for 24 h with or without BGN alone and co-incubated for an additional 18–24 h with or without BGN and either GM6001 (1–100 μm) or TIMP-2 (1–100 nm) to inactivate MT1-MMP. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were grown for 12 h in DMEM-10% FBS. Cells were then washed with PBS and surface biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 50 mm N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Amresco, Solon, OH) in PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture set III. The lysates were precleared with protein G-agarose beads (Calbiochem). The samples of cell lysates, each containing 1.0 mg of protein, were mixed with the MT1-MMP antibody AB815 (1 μg) and protein G-agarose, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C overnight. After extensive washings, immune complexes were released by boiling the beads for 5 min in a 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Solubilized proteins were subjected to Western blotting with Extravidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a TMB/M substrate. Where indicated, cells were co-incubated for 24 h with GM6001 (25 μm) and dec-RVKR-cmk (50 μm) to inactivate cellular MT1-MMP and furin, respectively. Biotinylation and 2-Mercaptoethane Sulfonic Acid (MESNA) Treatment of Cells—Cells grown to an 80–90% confluence were washed twice with an ice-cold Soerensen Buffer (SBS), containing 14.7 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm Na2HPO4, and 120 mm sorbitol, pH 7.8, and then incubated for 10 min in ice-cold SBS. Cell surface-associated MT1-MMP was biotinylated by incubating cells for 20 min on ice with SBS supplemented with membrane-impermeable EZ-Link NHS-SS-biotin (0.3 mg/ml). Excess biotin was removed by washing the cells in ice-cold SBS. The residual amounts of biotin were quenched by incubating the cells for 10 min in SBS containing 100 mm glycine. Quenched cells were washed in SBS and incubated for 15 min at 37°C in L-15 medium supplemented with a 1% insulin/transferrin/selenium to allow the internalization of biotin-labeled MT1-MMP. To remove the residual cell surface biotin, cells were incubated for 25 min on ice in SBS containing membrane-impermeable MESNA (150 mm). Cells were extensively washed with ice-cold SBS, and lysed in an RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture set III, and, in addition, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mm EDTA. MT1-MMP was precipitated from cell lysates using streptavidin-agarose beads. The precipitated samples were analyzed by Western blotting with the MT1-MMP AB815 antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated with HRP and a TMB/M substrate (47Remacle A.G. Rozanov D.V.

Pulldown of MT1-MMP on Con A-Agarose Beads—U-MT/PDX, HT-mock, and HT-MT cells grown to 80% confluence were lysed in an RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture set III supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2. Cell lysates (0.7 mg of total protein) were then incubated overnight at 4°C with Con A-agarose beads (30 μl of 50% slurry) equilibrated in an RIPA buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2. After extensive washings, the precipitated material was released by boiling the beads for 5 min in a 2× SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Solubilized proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using the MT1-MMP AB815 antibody as described above. Purification of MT1-MMP using Marimastat-tethered Sepharose—HT-mock and HT-MT cells were lysed in an RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture set III and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were passed 10 times through a 0.26-gauge needle. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was used for further experiments. To remove gelatin-binding MMP-2 and MMP-9, the supernatant aliquot (1.5 ml with a total protein of 1 mg/ml) was incubated for 16 h at 4°C with gelatin-Sepharose 4B beads (150 μl of a 50% slurry). The samples were spun to pellet the beads and the supernatant samples were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% Brij-35 and supplemented with an inhibitor mixture set III and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The dialyzed samples were then mixed with the Marismatat-tethered Separose 6B beads (60 μl of a 50% slurry). After incubation for 16 h at 4°C, the resin was washed twice with the above buffer, and then three times with the same buffer containing 1 mm NaCl. MT1-MMP was eluted from the beads using reducing 5× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue and 50% glycerol). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and analyzed for the presence of carbohydrates using a GlycoProfile III Fluorescent Glycoprotein Detection kit (Sigma). The N-terminal peptide sequence of the MT1-MMP species isolated from HT-MT cells was determined by N-terminal microsequencing at ProSeq (Boxford, MA). Enzymatic Desialylation of MT1-MMP—Enzymatic desialylation with neuraminidase (Sigma) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MCF-MT-His cells were lysed in an RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture set III, supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and GM6001 (10 μm). The MT-His protein was immunocaptured from cell lysates using a murine monoclonal antibody to polyhistidine immobilized on agarose beads. The immunocaptured samples were extensively washed with RIPA buffer and then equilibrated in a neuraminidase buffer containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2. The MT-His samples were incubated for 24 h at 37°C in the buffer alone and in the buffer supplemented with neuraminidase (0.5 unit). The digest samples were analyzed by Western blotting with the MT1-MMP antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with HRP and a TMB/M substrate. In addition, the samples were analyzed using HRP-labeled peanut lectin. Metabolic Labeling and the Degradation Kinetics of Cellular MT1-MMP—LoVo-MT cells were metabolically labeled in methionine-deficient DMEM with [35S]methionine Translabel (10 mCi/1 × 107 cells) (ICN, Irvine, CA) (23Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Yu Q. Baciu P.C. Rozanov D.V. Strongin A.Y. Traffic. 2004; 5: 627-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After a 15-min pulse with [35S]methionine, cells were chased for 0.5–4 h in DMEM-5% FBS supplemented with 10 mm l-methionine. Immediately after chase, 0.01% sodium azide was added to the cells to block cellular metabolic and synthetic activity as well as to prevent protein trafficking. Cells were then surface-biotinylated with membrane-impermeable biotin and lysed as described above. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose beads, and the AB815 antibody to MT1-MMP to isolate total cellular [35S]MT1-MMP. After washing, the bound material was solubilized by incubating the beads in 100 μl of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Following centrifugation, 1 m Tris was added to the supernatant fractions to neutralize the acid and to reach pH 7. Streptavidin-agarose beads (50 μl of a 50% slurry) were added to each of the supernatant fractions to capture the biotinylated, cell surface-associated, [35S]MT1-MMP. After washing, the captured proteins were released by boiling the beads in 50 μl of reducing 2× SDS sample buffer. Capture of the biotinylated molecules on streptavidin-agarose allowed us to separate the cell surface-associated biotin-labeled [35S]MT1-MMP from the total cellular [35S]MT1-MMP. The samples of the total cell and the cell surface-associated, biotin-labeled pools were each examined by SDS-PAGE followed by radioautography. In Vivo Tumorigenicity Assay and the Analysis of MT1-MMP in Tumor Xenografts—To generate tumor xenografts, LoVo-mock, and LoVo-MT (1 × 107 cells in 0.1 ml PBS each), and HT-mock and HT-MT cell suspension (1 × 106 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS each) were injected s.c. in athymic female 4-week-old immunodeficient BALB/c nu/nu mice (Benton & Kingman, San Francisco, CA). Five animals were used per each group. Tumor xenograft growth was monitored every 3–7 days by caliper measurements of two perpendicular diameters of xenografts (D1 and D2). Tumor volume was calculated by the formula p/6(D1 × D2)3/2, and was expressed as mean tumor volume ± S.E. (in mm3). At the end of the experiments at 21 days (for HT-mock and HT-MT xenografts) and at 40 days (for LoVo-mock and LoVo-MT xenografts) after the cell injection, mice were sacrificed according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Tumors were excised free of connective tissue, washed and cut. Tumor pieces (about 5–10 mm3 each) were extracted with 2× SDS sample buffer (1:2 w/v). After extraction for 2 h at ambient temperature, samples were diluted 2-fold with a 1× SDS sample buffer and homogenized by sequential passages through 18- and 23-gauge needles. The solubilized material was separated from the pellet by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Aliquots of supernatants (50 μg of total protein each) were analyzed by Western blotting with the MT1-MMP antibodies. Overexpressed MT1-MMP Is Autolytically Degraded in Cancer Cells—We determined the expression levels and the molecular forms of cell surface-associated MT1-MMP naturally synthesized by MDCK-mock, U-mock, HT-mock, LoVo-mock, MCF-mock, CHO-mock, and HEK293-mock cells by surface lab"
https://openalex.org/W2023022330,"Epithelial cells lining human airways and cells recruited to airways participate in the innate immune response in part by releasing human neutrophil peptides (HNP). Arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases (ART) on the surface of these cells can catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to proteins. We reported that ART1, a mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferase, present in epithelial cells lining the human airway, modified HNP-1, altering its function. ADP-ribosylated HNP-1 was identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or a history of smoking (and having two common polymorphic forms of ART1 that differ in activity), but not in normal volunteers or patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Modified HNP-1 was not found in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients or in leukocyte granules of normal volunteers. The finding of ADP-ribosyl-HNP-1 in BALF but not in leukocyte granules suggests that the modification occurred in the airway. Most of the HNP-1 in the BALF from individuals with a history of smoking was, in fact, mono- or di-ADP-ribosylated. ART1 synthesized in Escherichia coli, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ART1 released with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from transfected NMU cells, or ART1 expressed endogenously on C2C12 myotubes modified arginine 14 on HNP-1 with a secondary site on arginine 24. ADP-ribosylation of HNP-1 by ART1 was substantially greater than that by ART3, ART4, ART5, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S, or cholera toxin A subunit. Mouse ART2, which is an NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase, was able to modify HNP-1, but to a lesser extent than ART1. Although HNP-1 was not modified to a significant degree by ART5, it inhibited ART5 as well as ART1 activities. Human β-defensin-1 (HBD1) was a poor transferase substrate. Reduction of the cysteine-rich defensins enhanced their ability to serve as ADP-ribose acceptors. We conclude that ADP-ribosylation of HNP-1 appears to be primarily an activity of ART1 and occurs in inflammatory conditions and disease.

Inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, are recruited to the airway of patients with chronic lung disorders (1Aarbiou J. Ertmann M. van Wetering S. van Noort P. Rook D. Rabe K.F.

Protein mediators of innate immunity, such as defensins, are produced by these cells and epithelial cells lining the airway. Defensins constitute over 5% of the protein content of neutrophils (3Rice W.G. Ganz T. Kinkade Jr., J.M. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. Parmley R.T. Blood. 1987; 70: 757-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are the major component of azurophilic granules; degranulation may be responsible for the increased defensin amount found in airway inflammation. Neutrophils and defensins have been found in airways of patients with cystic fibrosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and other inflammatory lung diseases. Increased numbers of neutrophils were found in the airway of patients with asthma (4Ordonez C.L. Shaughnessy T.E. Matthay M.A. Fahy J.V. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Defensins have 29 to 35 amino acids, are arginine-rich, and contain three disulfide bridges. They are antimicrobial for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses, cytotoxic for epithelial cells, and chemotactic for T cells. They induce cytokine production, and modulate cell proliferation (6Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar).

Balducci E. Cavanaugh E. Kim H.J. Konczalik P. Lesma E.A. Okazaki I.J. Park M. Shoemaker M. Stevens L.A. Zolkiewska A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 109-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This post-translational modification occurs in viruses, bacterial, and eukaryotic cells. Most ARTs also have NAD glycohydrolase activity, generating free ADP-ribose from NAD. The best studied ADP-ribosylation reactions are those catalyzed by certain bacterial toxins, in particular, cholera toxin, which, in many cells, transfers ADP-ribose to an arginine residue in the guanine nucleotide-binding protein, Gαs (11Tsai S.C. Noda M. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5139-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Like cholera toxin, mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases catalyze arginine-specific transferase reactions, but specific cellular substrates differ.In mammalian cells, the known ADP-ribosyltransferases share less than 10% sequence identity, but are structurally similar in their catalytic sites. Only ART1, -3, -4, and -5 have been identified in the human genome and they exhibit restricted tissue distributions (12Glowacki G. Braren R. Firner K. Nissen M. Kuhl M. Reche P. Bazan F.

Human ART1 has a polymorphism in codon 302, resulting in isoforms that differ in their capacity to ADP-ribosylate membrane-associated proteins (13Yadollahi-Farsani M. Kefalas P. Saxty B.A. MacDermot J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). ART1, -3, and -4 appear to be glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored, whereas ART5, expressed in lymphocytes, lacks the carboxyl-terminal signal sequence for addition of a GPI anchor and is predicted to be secreted (14Okazaki I.J. Kim H.J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22052-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both ART1 and ART5 are arginine-specific transferases.HNP-1 is a substrate for ART. ADP-ribosylation altered its biological properties assayed in vitro, decreasing cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity while maintaining its function as a T-cell chemoattractant and stimulant of interleukin-8 release from epithelial cells (15Paone G.

Consistent with a biological role for this modification, ADP-ribosylated HNP-1 was found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of some, but not all smokers, possibly related to expression of an ART1 polymorphism. Epithelial cells in human airways as well as other immune response participants, e.g. polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, express different ARTs including ART1, -3, and -4 (16Balducci E.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Conceivably, ARTs found on airway epithelial and leukocytes surfaces could modify the arginine-rich defensins released from polymorphonuclear leukocytes and epithelial cells in response to lung inflammation and affect anti-microbial activity.We investigated whether modification of HNP-1 was specific for ART1 and whether free ADP-ribose generated by NAD glycohydrolase activity of ARTs might react with the cationic defensin in vitro. To determine whether the modified form of HNP-1 occurs in vivo, HNP was isolated and analyzed for modifications from the BALF of patients with several pulmonary diseases. Moreover, to assess a potential regulatory effect of HNP-1 concentration on transferase activity, we investigated the effect of HNP-1 on ART1 and -5 activities.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of ART1, ART3, ART4, ART5, ART2.2, and CTA1—Rabbit ART1 (rART1) and mouse ART5 (mART5) were synthesized in Escherichia coli and purified as described (15Paone G.

Briefly, ART1, cloned from a rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA library by PCR, and mouse lymphocyte ART5 cDNAs, were subcloned into a pFLAG-MAC (Sigma) expression vector and used to transform E. coli BL-21(DE3) competent cells (Novagen). Cells were sonified, centrifuged, and purified on anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ART2.2 cDNA was inserted into pCMV-Neo vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and the protein was expressed as a GPI-linked protein on the surface of COS1 cells. Protein was collected following treatment of intact cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) as described (19Kanaitsuka T. Bortell R. Stevens L.A. Moss J. Sardinha D. Rajan T.V. Zipris D. Mordes J.P. Greiner D.L. Rossini A.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2741-2749PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse ART1 (mART1) or mART4 (20Koch-Nolte F. Haag F. Braren R. Kuhl M. Hoovers J. Balasubramanian S. Bazan F. Thiele H.G. Genomics. 1997; 39: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) open reading frames were subcloned in pMH vector and the hemagglutinin tag sequence (TACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCT) was inserted in-frame at the amino terminus of the protein sequence using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). NMU cells (rat adenocarcinoma cells) were transfected with vector constructs of mART1, or mART4 using the Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were selected with Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen), 0.5 mg/ml. NMU cells expressing mART4 or mART1 were incubated for 1 h with 0.05 units of PI-PLC (ICN) in 0.3 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were sedimented (1000 × g) and the supernatant containing PI-PLC-released protein was collected. pGex-2T vector containing the ART3 cDNA was transfected into E. coli BL21. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). ART2b and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S ADP-ribosyltransferase (transferase domain) and its activator, FAS (factor activating exoenzyme S), were gifts from Dr. Rita Bortell (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA) and Dr. Joseph Barbieri (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI), respectively. Reduced and alkylated cholera toxin A1 subunit, the catalytic component of cholera toxin (CTA, List Biological Laboratories, Campbell CA), was prepared and purified as described (21Noda M. Tsai S.C.

Purified ART3 was quantified by comparison to Coomassie-stained bovine serum albumin after SDS-PAGE separation. Modification of HNP-1 was determined by incubation overnight (∼17 h) at 30 °C with rART1, mART1, auto-ADP-ribosylated-ART5 synthesized in E. coli, alkylated CTA1 or mART4 (25-fold the immunoreactivity of mART1), synthetic HNP-1 (Bachem, Torrance, CA), and NAD as indicated in the figure legends. ART3 (20 ng), exoenzyme S (transferase domain, 100 nm, 10 nmol activity) with FAS (factor activating exoenzyme S) (100 nm), ART2b (4 nmol activity), or ART2.2 (4 nmol activity) were incubated with 5 nmol of HNP-1 and 5 mm NAD in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 μl at 30 °C overnight followed by HPLC separation of the products. To determine the extent of modification, the results were compared with the same reaction conditions with ART1 (4 nmol) incubated with HNP-1 (5 nmol) and 5 mm NAD. In preparation for RP-HPLC, guanidine HCl was added to a final concentration of 6 m. The mixture was applied to a Vydac C18 HPLC column (Nest Group, Southboro, MA) or a Discovery BioWide Pore C18 HPLC column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), equilibrated with HPLC-grade water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solution A). Reaction products were separated by gradient elution, flow = 0.8 ml/min. Solution A for 20 min was followed by a linear gradient for 60 min of 0 to 60% solution B (100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid), then 95% solution B, for 25 min. Separation was monitored by absorbance at 210, 258, and 280 nm. Fractions were analyzed by MALDI-MS (Ciphergen, Biosystem). Products of NAD glycohydrolase reactions were isolated by HPLC anion exchange separation using a DuPont SAX column (4.6 × 250 mm, Thomson Instruments, Clear Brook, VA) by gradient elution. Solution A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.5), for 30 min, was followed by a linear gradient for 10 min to 100% solution B (solution A + 1.0 m NaCl), followed by 10 min at 100% B, flow = 1.0 ml/min.MS Analysis of ADP-ribosylated HNP-1—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and HPLC electrospray mass spectrometric mapping of ADP-ribosylation sites were performed as described (15Paone G. Wada A. Stevens L.A. Matin A. Hirayama T. Levine R.L. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8231-8235Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—C2C12 (mouse skeletal muscle) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum, with 0.45/mg/ml Geneticin (G-418, Invitrogen Inc.). Rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells (NMU) transfected with plasmids containing mART1, or mART4 cDNA were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) with 0.5 mg/ml G-418. All cells were supplied by American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).Isolation of ADP-ribosyl-HNP-1 from Human BALF—Clinical protocols were approved by the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained for all subjects. Proteins from 10-ml samples of BALF (cells: 127 ± 15 × 106) from 20 cigarette smokers (protocol 95-H-167) were prepared as described (15Paone G. Wada A. Stevens L.A. Matin A. Hirayama T. Levine R.L. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8231-8235Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) before separation by RP-HPLC. Seven samples had HNP-1. Peaks (absorbance at 210 nm) corresponding to HNP-1 and ADP-ribosyl-HNP-1 were analyzed by MALDI-MS. HNP from 8 ml of BALF from patients with biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (protocol 99-H-0068), asthma (protocol 99-H-0076), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (protocol 95-H-0186), and normal volunteers (protocol 96-H-0100) was prepared for MS analysis without separation by RP-HPLC. HNP-1 was quantified by MS analysis from normal volunteers with a history of smoking (protocol 95-H-0167) without RP-HPLC separation.RESULTSTo determine the modification state of HNP-1 in patients with airway diseases, HNP-1 was isolated from the BALF of patients with pulmonary disease, e.g. lymphangioleiomyomatosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma, and compared with HNP isolated from BALF of smokers and leukocyte granules of normal volunteers as reported (Table 1) (15Paone G. Wada A. Stevens L.A. Matin A. Hirayama T. Levine R.L. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8231-8235Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). BALF from normal volunteers did not contain HNP-1 (data not shown). In isolated HNPs, HNP-1 was the isoform present at the highest concentration; little or no HNP-2 or -3 was detected. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and asthma BALF, both mono- and di-modified HNP-1 were identified suggesting that, in these patients, neutrophils were recruited to the airway where the released defensin could come in contact with epithelial cells expressing an arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase. HNP was also isolated from leukocyte granules (four patients), but modified forms were not identified, consistent with the modification of HNP-1 occurring after its release from neutrophils. The extent of modification of HNP-1 was determined in individuals with a history of smoking. BALF was purified by Sep-Pak C18 and then analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Most of the HNP-1 was either mono- or di-ADP-ribosylated, based on recovery assessed with controls containing ART1-modified HNP-1 (Table 2). Sputum from cystic fibrosis patients had been reported to contain defensins at a concentration of 0.3–1.6 mg/ml (23Soong L.B. Ganz T. Ellison A. Caughey G.H. Inflamm. Res. 1997; 46: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylated HNP was not detected in HNP isolated from cystic fibrosis sputum. The absence of ADP-ribosylated HNP-1 in cystic fibrosis sputum could be because of the inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity by the high concentrations of chloride and sodium ions in cystic fibrosis airway surface liquid (24Smith J.J. Travis S.M. Greenberg E.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). A concentration as high as 225 mm NaCl, did not, however, inhibit ADP-ribosylation of HNP-1 by ART1 in vitro (data not shown). Alternatively, HNP-1 could be cytotoxic to the epithelial cells expressing ART1 or perhaps prevented from contact with cell-associated ART1 due to the bacterial biofilm.TABLE 1Isolation and analysis of HNP-1 from patientsSampleHNP-1ADP-ribosyl-HNP-1Di-ADP-ribosyl-HNP-1Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (BALF)+++Asthma (BALF)+++Cystic fibrosis (sputum)+−−Human leukocytes (granules)+−−Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (BALF)−−− Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Isolation of HNP-1 from patient BALF (pmol)SampleHNP-1ADP-ribosyl-HNP-1Di-ADP-ribosyl-HNP-1TotalModified%A25859120188B18448714988C63316019997D0404100E0404100 Open table in a new tab To determine ART specificity for modification of HNP-1, HNP-1 and NAD were incubated with ARTs from different sources, either free in solution or cell-associated (e.g. released from the cell or GPI-anchored), presuming that physical access of the peptide to the enzyme might be context-specific. The sources of bacterial and mammalian transferases included mouse C2C12 cells that endogenously express ART1 when differentiated into myotubes (Fig. 1a), undifferentiated C2C12 cells (Fig. 1d) (25Zolkiewska A. Thompson W.C. Moss J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 26Zolkiewska A. Moss J. J. Biol.

Among reaction products that were purified by RP-HPLC, those identified by MALDI-MS included peptides of 3,439 Da molecular mass, consistent with unmodified HNP-1 (•); 3,983 Da, consistent with mono-ADP-ribosylated-HNP-1 (*) (ADP-ribosylated on arginine 14, based on previous analysis (15Paone G. Wada A. Stevens L.A. Matin A. Hirayama T. Levine R.L. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8231-8235Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); and 4,524 Da (○), consistent with di-ADP-ribosyl-HNP-1 (ADP-ribosylated on arginine 24 in addition to arginine 14, based on MS analysis as described under “Materials and Methods”). By HPLC analysis, primarily ART1, from multiple sources, free or cell-associated, catalyzed the transfer of an ADP-ribose moiety to HNP-1; ART2b (the rat ART2 isoform, 4 nmol; data not shown), ART3 (20 ng, data not shown), ART4, and ART5 were inactive by HPLC analysis. ART2.2 (mouse isoform, 4 nmol) exhibited less than 10% the activity of ART1 (data not shown). Cholera toxin and P. aeruginosa exoenzyme S (transferase domain, 10 nmol), produced as a recombinant protein in E. coli, were also inactive.ADP-ribosylated HNP-1 was not formed in the presence of NADP, consistent with an ART1 preference for NAD as substrate (Figs. 1 and 2a). HNP-1 is a basic protein containing multiple lysine and arginine residues. ADP-ribose can react non-enzymatically with lysine (27Cervantes-Laurean D. Minter D.E. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and ARTs are known to exhibit NAD glycohydrolase activity, which produces ADP-ribose. Free ADP-ribose did not react with HNP-1, consistent with the conclusion that the modification of HNP-1 by ART1 was not due to the non-enzymatic addition of ADP-ribose generated by ART NAD glycohydrolase activity (Figs. 1 and 2b).FIGURE 2Modification of defensin. a, effect of HNP-1 or agmatine on nicotinamide release from NAD catalyzed by ART1. mART1 (3.6 nmol/h) synthesized in NMU cells was incubated with 0.1 mm [nicotinamide-U-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi), in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 1.5 h at 30 °C, with the indicated concentrations of agmatine (•) or HNP-1 (▴) in 150 μl. Two samples (50 μl) were applied to Dowex AG1-X2 (Bio-Rad) columns and [14C]nicotinamide was eluted with 5 ml of water for liquid scintillation counting as described (34Moss J. Manganiello V.C.

The reactions were stopped by the addition of guanidine HCl and subjected to HPLC as described under “Materials and Methods.” Amounts of mono-ADP-ribosylated-HNP-1 (○) or di-ADP-ribosylated-HNP1 (•) were calculated from the area under the absorbance peak at 210 nm. Data are representative of those from two experiments. c, ADP-ribosylation of HNP-1 and HBD1 by ART1 and ART5. mART1 (4 nmol/h) or mART5 (4 nmol/h) were incubated with HNP-1 (1 nmol) or HBD1 (1 nmol), as indicated, in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 μm [adenylate-32P]NAD (1 μCi/assay), and 100 μm ADP-ribose in 100 μl at 30 °C for 1 h, followed by 5 mm NAD overnight. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the proteins were separated on 16% Tricine gels (Invitrogen). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (BioMax, Kodak).

In ART1, a single nucleotide polymorphism results in proline replacement of leucine 257 with alteration of transferase activity, measured by ADP-ribosylation of membrane-associated proteins (13Yadollahi-Farsani M. Kefalas P. Saxty B.A. MacDermot J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To determine whether a specific ART1 isoform was responsible for the modification of HNP-1 in vivo, the genomic DNA of smokers was analyzed to identify the codon for amino acid 257 (Table 3). Modified HNP-1 was found in the BALF of smokers regardless of the ART1 polymorphism.TABLE 3Association of ART1 amino acid 257 polymorphism in smokers with ADP-ribosyl-HNP-1 in BALFPatient No.Position 257ADP-ribosyl-HNP-11Leu/Leu+2Pro/Pro-3Pro/Pro-4Pro/Pro+5Pro/Pro+6Leu/Pro-7Leu/Pro- Open table in a new tab ADP-ribosyltransferase reactions proceed by an Sn2-like mechanism.

In neonatal cardiomyocytes, interleukin-1β and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) both stimulated mPGES-1 mRNA expression and increased mPGES-1 mRNA stability and protein synthesis but failed to increase mPGES-1 mRNA transcription.

JNK enzymes phosphorylate transcription factors, such as c-Jun, JunD, and ATF2, that participate in the formation and activation of the AP-1 complex (14Karin M. Gallagher E.

Mendez M. LaPointe M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H165-H174Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the notion that mPGES-1 mRNA levels may be regulated through AP-1-stimulated increases in mPGES-1 mRNA transcription (16Cheng S. Afif H. Martel-Pelletier J.

In contrast, the expression of some genes that code for prostaglandin biosynthetic enzymes, such as Cox-2, are partially regulated though stabilization of mRNA (13Degousee N. Martindale J.

Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). JNK family members include JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, each of which has multiple isoforms that are generated through alternative splicing events (14Karin M. Gallagher E. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). JNK1 and JNK2 have been identified in mouse cardiomyocytes (19Liang Q. Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Kuan C.Y. Xia Y.

The role that individual JNK enzymes play in the regulation of the Ptges gene expression and the role of JNK enzymes in mPGES-1 mRNA transcription and mPGES-1 mRNA stabilization have not been elucidated. In this study we show the following. 1) mPGES-1 mRNA is constitutively transcribed in neonatal cardiomyocytes. 2) IL-1β and LPS stimulate increases in neonatal cardiomyocyte mPGES-1 mRNA levels by stabilizing mPGES-1 mRNA, in a JNK-dependent fashion, but do not increase mPGES-1 mRNA transcription. 3) JNK1 or JNK2 can participate in the regulation of mPGES-1 protein synthesis in neonatal cardiomyocytes. 4) The majority of PGE2 production by LPS-stimulated neonatal cardiomyocytes is catalyzed by mPGES-1.

LPS (from Escherichia coli 0111:B4) and all other reagents (analytical or tissue culture grade) were obtained from Sigma. Primary Cell Culture and Experimental Protocol—Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from the hearts of 1- to 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (12Degousee N. Stefanski E. Lindsay T.F. Ford D.A. Shahani R. Andrews C.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Nevalainen T.J. Tischfield J. Rubin B.B. J. Biol.

Mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1- to 2-day-old jnk1–/–, jnk1+/+, jnk2–/–, jnk2+/+, Ptges+/+, or Ptges–/– mice using identical methodology. Cells were incubated with adenoviral vectors, as indicated in the figure legends, or with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 μmol/liter) for 30 min, and then treated with vehicle, IL-1β (10 ng/ml), or LPS (5 μg/ml) for up to 32 h. When chemicals were dissolved in Me2SO or ethanol, the identical concentration of these solvents was added to controls. All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated 3–6 times. In all studies, cytotoxicity was assessed by monitoring the extracellular release of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Studies in which the release of lactate dehydrogenase or creatine kinase exceeded >5% of total cellular activity were excluded from further analysis. In all studies, isolated cells had characteristic features of cardiomyocytes and beat spontaneously. The methodology used for RNA isolation and Northern and immunoblot analysis has been described (12Degousee N. Stefanski E. Lindsay T.F. Ford D.A. Shahani R. Andrews C.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C.

All studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Toronto General Hospital. Adenoviruses—The preparation of recombinant adenoviruses (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffery D. Molkentin, University of Cincinnati, OH) encoding murine wild type JNK1 (ad-JNK1-WT), mutated phosphorylation-resistant JNK1 (ad-JNK1-DN), wild type JNK2 (ad-JNK2-WT), and mutated phosphorylation-resistant JNK2 (ad-JNK2-DN) was carried out as described previously (19Liang Q.

In all experiments using adenovirally mediated gene transfer, a multiplicity of infection of 25–50 plaque-forming units/cell was used, and cells were infected 24–48 h before stimulation. Viral titers were determined by the agarose gel overlay technique. Cell viability was routinely confirmed by trypan blue exclusion. Transgenic Mice—JNK1 and JNK2 gene-targeted mice were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Karin, University of California, San Diego (23Sabapathy K. Kallunki T. David J.P. Graef I. Karin M. Wagner E.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Construction of the mPGES-1 gene-targeted mouse (Ptges–/–) has been reported (24Trebino C.E. Stock J.L. Gibbons C.P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9044-9049Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). All adult mice were generated by cross-breeding heterozygous mice (jnk1+/–, jnk2+/–, or Ptges+/–). Homozygous gene-targeted mice and their wild type littermates were identified by tail DNA genotyping. Preparation of Total Cell Lysates of Cultured Rat and Mouse Cardiac Myocytes—In selected studies, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer A (50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, 25 mmol/liter NaF, 0.5 mmol/liter nitrophenyl phosphate, 5 mmol/liter glycerophosphate, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 2 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After 30 min, the cell lysates were passed through a 21-gauge needle and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at –20 °C for subsequent immunoblotting studies. The protein content of the supernatant was determined using the BCA protein kit (Pierce). Preparation of Microsomal and Cytosolic Fractions of Rat and Mouse Cardiomyocytes—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 66 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm diisopropylphosphofluoridate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Thereafter, cells were sonicated on ice with three bursts (20% maximum power) of 15 s each and then centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C to remove nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to resolve the cytosolic and microsomal fractions. The cytosolic fraction was decanted into a clean tube; the microsomal pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer A. Protein content of the cytosolic and microsomal fractions was determined using the BCA protein kit (Pierce). JNK Immunoprecipitation and JNK Kinase Assay—Cells were infected with ad-JNK1-WT, ad-JNK1-DN, ad-JNK2-WT, or ad-JNK2-DN and lysed as described above, and the JNK isoforms were immunoprecipitated by incubating with anti-JNK1/2 antibody for 16 h. After addition of protein G-agarose beads and incubation for 3 h at 4°C, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer A and twice with kinase buffer (25 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mmol/liter glycerophosphate, 25 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmol/liter Na3VO4). Kinase reactions were initiated by addition of 1 μg of GST-ATF2 or 1 μg of GST-c-Jun and 200 μmol/liter ATP in 40 μl of kinase buffer. After 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling. Phosphorylation of ATF2 or of c-Jun was evaluated by immunoblot analysis with an anti-phospho-ATF2 or an anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA was extracted from rat or mouse cardiac myocytes or from mouse left ventricular tissue with the TRIzol Reagent, run on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary blotting, as described previously (13Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled 32P-mPGES-1 and [32P]GAPDH probes that were used for hybridization were prepared with [32P]dCTP and a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). After baking at 80 °C, the blot was subjected to hybridization with the 32P-mPGES-1 probe. Membranes were then washed extensively and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat) with one intensifying screen at –70 °C for periods ranging from 5 h to 3 days. Films were subsequently scanned and analyzed using an Imaging Densitometer (model GS-690) and the Molecular Analyst program (Bio-Rad). Blots were then washed and re-probed with the [32P]GAPDH cDNA probe, scanned, and analyzed. RT-PCR Analysis—After isolation, total RNA was treated with DNase I (RNase-free) and converted to cDNA mixtures exactly as described (13Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing 75 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20 mmol/liter (NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, dNTP mixture (0.2 mmol/liter each), 2 units of Taq polymerase (MBI Fermentas), and 0.4 μmol/liter of the specific primers. After 4 min at 95 °C, 28 cycles of amplification with a PTC-100 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) was carried out as follows: 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C followed by 10 min at 72 °C. The following primers were used in this study: for mouse mPGES-1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_022415), forward primer 5′-CTT TCT GCT CTG CAG CAC ACT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCC ATG GAG AAA CAG GAG AAC-3′, PCR product expected size of 378 bp; for mouse COX-2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_011198), forward primer 5′-CCA GAG CAG AGA GAT GAA AT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TAC TGT AGG GTT AAT GTC AT-3′, PCR product expected size of 469 bp; for mouse cPGES (GenBank™ accession number NM_019766), forward primer 5′-CGA AGG GAC TAT GTA TTC ATT G-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATC CTC ATC ACC ACC CAT GT-3′, PCR product expected size of 375 bp; for mouse mPGES-2 (NM_133783), forward primer 5′-ACT TCC ACT CCC TGC CCT AT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAG GTA CCA AGG CTG GAT GT-3′, PCR product expected size of 731 bp; for mouse GAPDH (GenBank™ accession number XM_214281), forward primer 5′-TTG TGA TGG GTG TGA ACC AC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCG GCA TCG AAG GTG GAA GA-3′, giving an expected size for the PCR product of 502 bp. All product levels were normalized to GAPDH levels. Reverse transcription-PCR products were analyzed by 2.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis, and specificities were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis with an ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The absence of genomic DNA in the RNA preparations was confirmed by performing PCR analysis of “minus-RT controls.” Assessment of mPGES-1 mRNA Expression and Stability—To assess the role of mRNA stabilization in the expression of mPGES-1 mRNA transcripts, confluent rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were treated for 16 h with vehicle, LPS (5 μg/ml), or IL-1β (10 ng/ml). Cells were then treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml), which arrests transcription. In other experiments, cells were additionally treated with 0.1% Me2SO or 10 μm SP600125. Total cellular RNA was extracted 0, 1, 2, 4–6, and 8 h after the addition of actinomycin D, reverse-transcribed exactly as described (13Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and cDNA mixtures analyzed in triplicate by real time quantitative PCR. mPGES-1 and GAPDH cDNA were quantified on an ABI 7900HT sequence detection system using the SYBR Green methodology, as described previously (13Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The same methodology was used to assess the expression of mPGES-1 mRNA transcripts in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes over the course of 32 h after treatment with vehicle, LPS (5 μg/ml), or IL-1β (10 ng/ml). The following primers were used: for rat mPGES-1, forward primer 5′-TAC GCG GTG GCT GTC ATC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCA CAT CTG GGT CAC TCC-3′, PCR product of 115 bp; for rat GAPDH, forward primer 5′-TTC ACC ACC ATG GAG AAG G-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTC GTG GTT CAC ACC CAT C-3′, PCR product of 111 bp. PCR products were sized using dissociation curve analysis. mPGES-1 product levels were normalized to GAPDH levels and expressed as a percentage of base-line results. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Real Time Quantitative PCR—ChIP was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), exactly as described previously by our group (13Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The amount of target DNA was quantified on an ABI 7900HT sequence detection system using the SYBR Green methodology and the following primers that amplify a portion of exon 1 of the rat mPGES-1 sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_021583): mPGES+128-5′ (5′-CCT GGG TTT GGT GAT GGA GAA CA-3′) and mPGES+79-3′ (5′-CGT ACA TCT TGA TGA CCA GCA GTG TG-3′). Determinations were performed in triplicate on 2 μl of bound chromatin and 2 μl of a 10-fold dilution of input chromatin in a 25-μl reaction using the following cycling parameters: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The number of copies of the target sequence determined by comparison to serial dilutions of rat genomic DNA (where 1 ng of genomic DNA equals ∼300 copies of a single copy gene) was determined by subtracting the number of target DNA molecules in the no antibody control sample from the number in the RNA polymerase II immunoprecipitated samples, and dividing by the number in the diluted input sample. Nuclear Run-off Analysis—Studies were performed as described previously (13Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were isolated from vehicle-, LPS- (5 μg/ml), or IL-1β (10 ng/ml)-treated cultured rat cardiac myocytes exactly as reported (13Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In selected studies, cells were incubated with 0.1% Me2SO or 10 μm SP600125 for 30 min before stimulation. In vitro transcription of the nuclear samples was performed in the presence of 125 μCi of [32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol). Nuclear transcripts were isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate phenol/chloroform method (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and purified on Micro-30 spin columns (Bio-Rad). After denaturation by boiling, the labeled RNA was resuspended at 2 × 106 cpm/ml in Northern hybridization buffer (5×Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 5 × SSPE, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm). Equal amounts (1 μg) of gel-purified cDNA probes were denatured by boiling in 0.4 m NaOH, 10 mm EDTA and neutralized with equal volumes of 2 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, and then slot blotted onto nylon filters (Hybond N). Recombinant GAPDH (1 kb), mPGES-1 (0.15 kb), and COX-2 inserts (full size fragment, 1.9 kb) were used as probes for the slot blots. Hybridization was performed for 48–72 h at 42 °C in Northern hybridization buffer. Hybridized filters were washed extensively, subjected to autoradiography, and quantified as described for Northern blot experiments. Measurement of PGE2 Synthase Activity and PGE2 Release by Cardiac Myocytes—PGE2 synthase activity in lysates of cardiac myocytes was measured exactly as described (26Thoren S. Jakobsson P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6428-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PGE2 levels in the supernatant of cardiac myocytes were assayed with an ELISA kit, as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Treatment of Mice—jnk1–/– and jnk2–/– mice or their wild type littermates (C57BL/6 background) were injected intraperitoneally with sterile saline (1 ml) or LPS (500 μg/ml) (n = 5 for each group). After 24 h, animals were killed by cervical dislocation. Ventricular tissue was immediately collected and processed for total cellular RNA extraction with the TRIzol reagent, as described previously (13Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). mPGES-1 cDNA levels were determined by real time quantitative PCR and normalized to GAPDH cDNA levels, as described above. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of 3–6 experiments, carried out in triplicate. Comparisons between groups were made by repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by post-hoc analysis with paired t tests, two-tailed, unequal variance. When multiple comparisons between groups were made, a Bonferroni correction was applied. A p value <0.05 was considered to be significant. IL-1β and LPS Both Increase PGE2 Release, PGES Activity, and Ptges Gene Expression in Cardiomyocytes—Treatment with IL-1β or LPS increased PGE2 release by primary cultures of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes in comparison with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1A). PGE2 release by cardiomyocytes was delayed, as no PGE2 was detected after 8 h of exposure to IL-1β or LPS, whereas significant PGE2 release was identified after exposure to IL-1β or LPS for 24 or 32 h. Treatment of cultured cardiomyocytes with IL-1β or LPS significantly increased the rate of conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 in vitro by microsomes prepared from these cells in comparison with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1B), thereby documenting an IL-1β- or LPS-stimulated increase in microsomal PGE2 synthase activity. In contrast, PGE2 synthase activity was not detected in cytosolic fractions of cardiomyocytes, despite the presence of cPGES, verified by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The effect of IL-1β or LPS on mPGES-1 mRNA expression, as well as mPGES-1, mPGES-2, and cPGES protein levels was then assessed. Quantitative PCR a"

As an alternative vaccine approach, we have previously presented a doxycycline (dox)-dependent HIV-1 variant that was constructed by incorporating the tetracycline-inducible gene expression system (Tet-On system) into the viral genome. Replication of this HIV-rtTA variant is driven by the dox-inducible transcriptional activator rtTA and can be switched on and off at will. A large scale evolution study was performed to test the genetic stability of this conditional live vaccine candidate. In several long term cultures, we selected for HIV-rtTA variants that no longer required dox for replication. These evolved variants acquired a typical amino acid substitution either at position 19 or 37 in the rtTA protein. Both mutations caused rtTA activity and viral replication in the absence of dox. We designed a novel rtTA variant with a higher genetic barrier toward these undesired evolutionary routes. The corresponding HIV-rtTA variant did not lose dox control in long term cultures, demonstrating its improved genetic stability.

This system, in which gene expression is stringently controlled by the nontoxic effector doxycycline (dox), is widely applied to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes (17Baron U. Bujard H.

The rtTA gene encoding the transcriptional activator was inserted in place of the nef gene, and the tet-operator (tetO) DNA-binding sites were placed in the viral LTR promoter. This HIV-rtTA virus does not replicate in the absence of dox. Binding of dox to rtTA triggers a conformational change that allows the protein to bind tetO DNA, resulting in transcriptional activation and subsequent viral replication. Upon vaccination with this virus, replication can be temporarily activated and controlled to the extent needed for induction of the immune system by transient dox administration. The initial HIV-rtTA virus has been greatly improved by viral evolution (20Das A.T. Zhou X. Vink M. Klaver B. Verhoef K. Marzio G. Berkhout B. J. Biol.

Ito Y. Lima R.G. Grivel J.C. Das A.T. Berkhout B. Margolis L.B. Virology. 2004; 328: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).The potential use of this dox-dependent HIV-rtTA virus as a vaccine raises new safety questions concerning the genetic stability of the introduced Tet-On system. There are several hypothetical evolutionary routes toward a constitutively replicating virus. First, the virus may restore the function of the Tat-TAR system, despite the multiple inactivating mutations that were introduced in both elements to avoid simple reversion to the wild-type sequence. In this scenario, the dox-controlled rtTA-tetO system will become superfluous and may be inactivated over time by mutation or deletion. Second, the viral LTR promoter could become a constitutive transcription element, for instance by acquisition of a binding site for a constitutively expressed cellular transcription factor. Replication of such a virus is not dependent on a virally encoded transactivator, neither Tat nor rtTA. Third, the introduced rtTA-tetO axis may lose dox dependence, thereby creating an uncontrolled Tet-On system. This scenario is most likely to occur through acquired mutations in the rtTA protein that shift its conformation into the DNA binding mode, even in the absence of dox. To address these safety issues, we followed the evolution of HIV-rtTA in multiple, independent virus cultures. We observed the loss of dox control in several cultures, which in all cases resulted from a typical amino acid substitution either at position 19 or 37 in the rtTA protein. We developed a novel rtTA variant with alternative amino acids at these positions and demonstrated that the corresponding HIV-rtTA variant did not lose dox control in long term cultures. Therefore, we improved the genetic stability of the Tet-On system and the HIV-rtTA vaccine candidate by blocking two unwanted evolutionary routes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESVirus Cultures—The HIV-rtTA infectious molecular clone is derived from the HIV-1 LAI proviral plasmid (24Peden K.

SupT1 cells (5 × 106) were transfected with 5 μg of the HIV-rtTA molecular clone by electroporation (250 V and 975 microfarad). Transfected cells were cultured with or without dox (Sigma D-9891). The CA-p24 level in the cell-free culture supernatant was determined by antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (25Back N.K. Nijhuis M. Keulen W. Boucher C.A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).The 24-well evolution experiment was started with transfection of 40 μg of the HIV-rtTA proviral plasmid into 2 × 107 SupT1 cells. The cells were split into 24 independent cultures and maintained in the presence of 1 μg/ml dox for up to 200 days. The virus-containing culture supernatant was passaged onto fresh SupT1 cells at the peak of infection, as determined by the massive appearance of syncytia. At regular intervals, supernatant samples were taken from the culture and tested in parallel infections with and without dox. The cell samples were stored at –80 °C for subsequent analysis.Proviral DNA Analysis and Cloning of Evolved Sequences—Total cellular DNA from HIV-rtTA-infected cells was isolated as described previously (26Das A.T. Klaver B. Klasens B.I. van Wamel J.L. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2346-2356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proviral DNA sequences were PCR-amplified from total cellular DNA. The first exon of the tat gene was amplified with the primers KV1 (5′-CCATCGATACCGTCGACATAGCAGAATAGG-3′) and 3′-TAT (5′-CGGGAATTCTTACTGCTTTGATAGAGAAAC-3′). The LTR-tetO region was amplified with the primers tTA-tetO1 (5′-CTCCCCGGGTAACTAAGTAAGGAT-3′) and C(N1) (5′-GGTCTGAGGGATCTCTAGTTACCAGAGTC-3′). The rtTA gene was amplified with the primers tTA1 (5′-ACAGCCATAGCAGTAGCTGAG-3′) and tTA-rev2 (5′-GATCAAGGATATCTTGTCTTCGT-3′). All of the PCR fragments were sequenced with the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). For the cloning of the G19E- or E37K-mutated rtTA sequences into the HIV-rtTA provirus, rtTA PCR fragments were digested with XcmI and SmaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the shuttle vector pBlue3′LTRext-deltaU3-rtTA-2ΔtetO (20Das A.T.

The BamHI-BglI fragment of the shuttle vector was used to replace the corresponding sequence in HIV-rtTA-2ΔtetO.Construction of Novel HIV-rtTA Variants and rtTA Expression Plasmids—HIV-rtTA variants with an alternative codon for G (GGU instead of GGA) at rtTA position 19 and with a wild-type (Glu) or alternative amino acid (Asp, Phe, Leu, Asn, Gln, Arg, and Ser) at position 37 were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The oligonucleotide G19 (5′-ATAACCATGTCTAGACTGGACAAGAGCAAAGTCATAAACTCTGCTCTGGAATTACTCAATGGTGTCGGTATCGAAGGCCTGACGACAAGGAAACTCGCT-3′, mutated nucleotide underlined) was annealed to the oligonucleotide rev-37 (5′-AGCAGGGCCCGCTTGTTCTTCACGTGCCAGTACAGGGTAGGCTGXXAACTCCCAGCTTTTGAGCGAGTTTCCTTGTCGTCAGGCCTTCGA-3′, with XX corresponding to amino acid 37; this triplet is CTC for Glu, ATC for Asp, GAA for Phe, AAG for Leu, ATT for Asn, CTG for Gln, GCG for Arg, and AGA for Ser), both strands were completed with Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of dNTPs, digested with XcmI and ApaI, and ligated into the similarly digested shuttle vector pBlue3′LTRext-deltaU3-rtTAF86Y/A209T-2ΔtetO (20Das A.T.

To generate rtTA variants with different amino acids at position 19 or 37, PCR was performed on pCMV-rtTA with the sense primer random-rtTA-19 (5′-TTCACCATGTCTAGACTGGACAAGAGCAAAGTCATAAACTCTGCTCTGGAATTACTCAATNNKGTCGGTATCGAAGGCCTGACGA-3′, with K corresponding to G or T, and N corresponding to G, A, T, or C) plus the antisense primer CMV2 (5′-TCACTGCATTCTAGTTGTGGT-3′) or with the sense primer CMV1 (5′-TGGAGACGCCATCCACGCT-3′) plus the antisense primer random-rtTA-37 (5′-AGCAGGGCCCGCTTGTTCTTCACGTGCCAGTACAGGGTAGGCTGMNNAACTCCCAGCTTTTGAGCGA-3′, with M corresponding to A or C, and N corresponding to G, A, T, or C), respectively.

To combine the G19F (UUU codon) and E37L (CUU codon) mutations, the E37L-containing StuI-BamHI fragment of pCMV-rtTAE37L was used to replace the corresponding sequence in pCMV-rtTAG19F, resulting in pCMV-rtTAG19F/E37L.

The cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa X1/6 cells were grown in 2-cm2 wells to 60% confluency and transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (20Das A.T. Zhou X. Vink M. Klaver B. Verhoef K. Marzio G. Berkhout B. J.

The DNA mixture consisted of 8 ng of pCMV-rtTA, 2.5 ng of pRL-CMV, and 990 ng of pBluescript as carrier DNA. The plasmid pRL-CMV (Promega) that constitutively expresses Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control to allow correction for differences in transfection efficiency. The cells were cultured after transfection for 48 h at different dox concentrations and then lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined with the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega) using a LUMIstar luminometer (BMG LABTECH). The expression of firefly and Renilla luciferase was within the linear range, and no squelching effects were observed. The activity of the rtTA variants was calculated as the ratio of the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities and corrected for between session variation (52Ruijter J.M. Thygesen H.H.

Virol. 2001; 75: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), in which the natural Tat-TAR elements that control viral gene expression and replication were inactivated by mutation and functionally replaced by the rtTA-tetO elements of the Tet-On system for inducible gene expression (Fig. 1A). This HIV-rtTA virus does not replicate constitutively, but exclusively in the presence of dox. We recently reported that long term replication of this virus resulted in rearrangement of the tetO elements and amino acid substitutions in the rtTA protein that significantly improve viral replication without losing dox control (20Das A.T.

A. 2001; 98: 6342-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We anticipated that the HIV-rtTA virus could evolve in different directions (see the Introduction) and therefore focused this study on the appearance of virus variants that no longer depend on dox for replication. We started multiple long term virus cultures and followed the development of dox independence. The evolution approach and the flow chart of the subsequent analyses are illustrated in Fig. 1B. The HIV-rtTA virus was passaged extensively in the presence of dox in 24 independent cultures. At several time points, supernatant samples were taken from the culture and tested in parallel infections without dox to determine the dox dependence of the evolved virus. The results for all 24 cultures are summarized in Fig. 1C (black squares). We observed a significant reduction in the number of dox-dependent viruses within 50 days of culturing, and only three cultures remained dox-dependent after 125 days.The replication curves of the original HIV-rtTA virus and two representative dox-independent virus cultures are shown in Fig. 2. Virus sample C5 did replicate without dox but can still be activated by dox to some extent, whereas virus sample C6 replicated with similar efficiency with and without dox. Total cellular DNA with integrated provirus was isolated from eight dox-independent HIV-rtTA cultures. We analyzed the sequence of both the “old” Tat-TAR motifs and the “new” rtTA-tetO motifs in the virus population. In all cultures, the Tat and TAR sequences contained the original mutations, indicating that the Tat-TAR axis of transcriptional activation had not been repaired. In contrast, we observed in all of the cultures the characteristic truncation of tetO elements that had previously been shown to improve dox-dependent HIV-rtTA replication (21Marzio G. Vink M. Verhoef K. de Ronde A. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3084-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Marzio G. Verhoef K. Vink M. Berkhout B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6342-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, viruses from all dox-independent cultures had acquired either a G19E or an E37K mutation in the rtTA gene (Fig. 1D). Two of the cultures (B6 and C6) contained additional amino acid substitutions. The repeated selection of G19E or E37K in multiple cultures, combined with their absence in the three cultures that remained dox-dependent (data not shown), strongly suggests their linkage to the acquired dox-independent phenotype.FIGURE 2Replication of evolved HIV-rtTA variants. Replication of the original HIV-rtTA virus, the virus from culture C6, or the virus from culture C5 (both harvested after 50 days of culturing) was compared by infecting SupT1 T cells with equal amounts of virus (5 ng/ml CA-p24) in the absence or presence of dox (1 μg/ml). Sequence analysis revealed that the C6 virus carried the G19E and E156K mutations in the rtTA gene, and the C5 virus carried the E37K mutation (Fig. 1D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Amino Acid Substitutions in rtTA Confer the Loss of dox Control—To demonstrate that these rtTA mutations are responsible for the observed viral replication without dox, we constructed HIV-rtTA molecular clones with the G19E or E37K mutation in the rtTA gene and assayed their replication at different dox concentrations (Fig. 3). The original HIV-rtTA virus did not replicate without dox and showed a graded increase in viral replication with increasing dox concentrations. HIV-rtTAG19E replicated efficiently both with and without dox. HIV-rtTAE37K also replicated without dox, but replication was more efficient with dox. These results demonstrate that the G19E or E37K mutation is sufficient to reduce the dox dependence of the HIV-rtTA virus.FIGURE 3Amino acid substitutions at rtTA position 19 or 37 confer the loss of dox control. The G19E and E37K mutated rtTA sequences were cloned into the HIV-rtTA-2ΔtetO proviral genome (21Marzio G. Vink M. Verhoef K. de Ronde A. Berkhout B. J.

We also tested the genetic stability of two improved HIV-rtTA variants in a similar 24-well long term culture assay. HIV-rtTA-2ΔtetO is identical to HIV-rtTA, but with the improved LTR-2ΔtetO promoter (21Marzio G. Vink M. Verhoef K. de Ronde A. Berkhout B. J.

A. 2001; 98: 6342-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and HIV-rtTAF86Y/A209T contains in addition the improved rtTAF86Y/A209T gene (20Das A.T. Zhou X. Vink M. Klaver B. Verhoef K. Marzio G. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18776-18782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). With both viruses we again observed the appearance of variants that replicated without dox, albeit at a significantly slower rate than the original HIV-rtTA (Fig. 1C). Whereas the original HIV-rtTA lost dox control in 50% of the cultures within 50 days, 50% of the HIV-rtTA-2ΔtetO cultures lost dox dependence in ∼75 days, and more than 50% of the HIV-rtTAF86Y/A209T cultures were still fully dox-dependent after 120 days, although the majority lost dox control upon prolonged culturing. Apparently, these new HIV-rtTA variants not only have an improved replication capacity but also have a lower tendency to lose dox control. Sequence analysis of two dox-independent HIV-rtTAF86Y/A209T cultures revealed the G19E mutation in both cases.HIV-rtTA Variants with Alternative Codons at rtTA Positions 19 and 37—In the evolution experiments, we observed very specific amino acid substitutions that reduced dox dependence at only two rtTA positions (G19E and E37K). Introduction of alternative rtTA codons may make such specific amino acid substitutions more difficult or even prevent these unwanted evolutionary routes. For instance, the G19E mutation involves a GGA to GAA codon change, and the G-to-A transition is the most frequent error during HIV-1 reverse transcription (28Berkhout B. Das A.T. Beerens N. Science. 2001; 292: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Vartanian J.P. Meyerhans A. Sala M. Wain-Hobson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Introduction of an alternative Gly codon (GGU or GGC) would require a much more difficult two-hit mutation, including one transversion, to create a Glu codon (GAA or GAG). We previously described that such a difference in genetic threshold can strongly influence the course of HIV-1 evolution (31Keulen W. Boucher C. Berkhout B.

As an alternative blocking strategy, we could replace the Glu37 codon with a non-Glu codon that would be more difficult to transform into a Lys codon. However, such an amino acid substitution should ideally not affect the activity or dox dependence of the rtTA protein. We first examined natural variation at this position in the tet repressor (TetR). The rtTA protein is based on the Escherichia coli class B TetR (TetRB), but there are six additional TetR classes (A, C, D, E, G, and H) (33Saenger W. Orth P. Kisker C. Hillen W. Hinrichs W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TetR from classes D, E, and H also have the Glu at position 37, but TetR from classes A, C, and G have a Gln instead. Evolution of a Gln codon (CAA or CAG) to a Lys codon (AAA or AAG) would require only a single C-to-A mutation, but this transversion is less frequently observed in HIV-1 evolution (28Berkhout B. Das A.T. Beerens N. Science. 2001; 292: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Vartanian J.P. Meyerhans A. Sala M. Wain-Hobson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We therefore constructed an HIV-rtTA variant with a Gln codon (CAG) at position 37 (E37Q). In addition, we constructed variants with Asp (GAU; E37D), Asn (AAU; E37N), Ser (UCU; E37S), Arg (CGC; E37R), Phe (UUC; E37F), or Leu (CUU; E37L). The E37D substitution leaves the aci"
https://openalex.org/W2015052004,"The transmembrane (TM) region of the Fc receptor-γ (FcRγ) chain is responsible for the association of this ubiquitous signal transduction subunit with many immunoreceptor ligand binding chains, making FcRγ key to a number of leukocyte activities in immunity and disease. Some receptors contain a TM arginine residue that interacts with Asp-11 of the FcRγ subunit, but otherwise the molecular basis for the FcRγ subunit interactions is largely unknown. This study reports residues in the TM region of the FcRγ subunit are important for association with the high affinity IgE receptor FcϵRI and a leukocyte receptor cluster member, the IgA receptor FcαRI. FcRγ residue Leu-21 was essential for surface expression of FcϵRIα/γ2 and Tyr-8, Leu-14, and Phe-15 contributed to expression. Likewise, detergent-stable FcRγ association with FcαRI was also dependent on Leu-14 and Leu-21 and in addition required residues Tyr-17, Tyr-25, and Cys-26. Modeling the TM regions of the FcRγ dimer indicated these residues interacting with both FcαRI and FcϵRI are near the interface between the two FcRγ TM helices. Furthermore, the FcRγ residues interacting with FcαRI form a leucine zipper-like interface with mutagenesis confirming a complementary interface comprising FcαRI residues Leu-217, Leu-220, and Leu-224. The dependence of these two nonhomologous receptor interactions on FcRγ Leu-14 and Leu-21 suggests that all the associated Fc receptors and the activating leukocyte receptor cluster members interact with this one site. Taken together these data provide a molecular basis for understanding how disparate receptor families assemble with the FcRγ subunit."
