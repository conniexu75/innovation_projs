https://openalex.org/W3010016408,"On average, an approved drug currently costs US$2-3 billion and takes more than 10 years to develop1. In part, this is due to expensive and time-consuming wet-laboratory experiments, poor initial hit compounds and the high attrition rates in the (pre-)clinical phases. Structure-based virtual screening has the potential to mitigate these problems. With structure-based virtual screening, the quality of the hits improves with the number of compounds screened2. However, despite the fact that large databases of compounds exist, the ability to carry out large-scale structure-based virtual screening on computer clusters in an accessible, efficient and flexible manner has remained difficult. Here we describe VirtualFlow, a highly automated and versatile open-source platform with perfect scaling behaviour that is able to prepare and efficiently screen ultra-large libraries of compounds. VirtualFlow is able to use a variety of the most powerful docking programs. Using VirtualFlow, we prepared one of the largest and freely available ready-to-dock ligand libraries, with more than 1.4 billion commercially available molecules. To demonstrate the power of VirtualFlow, we screened more than 1 billion compounds and identified a set of structurally diverse molecules that bind to KEAP1 with submicromolar affinity. One of the lead inhibitors (iKeap1) engages KEAP1 with nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant (Kd) = 114 nM) and disrupts the interaction between KEAP1 and the transcription factor NRF2. This illustrates the potential of VirtualFlow to access vast regions of the chemical space and identify molecules that bind with high affinity to target proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3009063121,"Most risk variants for brain disorders identified by genome-wide association studies reside in the noncoding genome, which makes deciphering biological mechanisms difficult. A commonly used tool, multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA), addresses this issue by aggregating single nucleotide polymorphism associations to nearest genes. Here we developed a platform, Hi-C-coupled MAGMA (H-MAGMA), that advances MAGMA by incorporating chromatin interaction profiles from human brain tissue across two developmental epochs and two brain cell types. By analyzing gene regulatory relationships in the disease-relevant tissue, H-MAGMA identified neurobiologically relevant target genes. We applied H-MAGMA to five psychiatric disorders and four neurodegenerative disorders to interrogate biological pathways, developmental windows and cell types implicated for each disorder. Psychiatric-disorder risk genes tended to be expressed during mid-gestation and in excitatory neurons, whereas neurodegenerative-disorder risk genes showed increasing expression over time and more diverse cell-type specificities. H-MAGMA adds to existing analytic frameworks to help identify the neurobiological principles of brain disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3009583110,"Intensive-care clinicians are presented with large quantities of measurements from multiple monitoring systems. The limited ability of humans to process complex information hinders early recognition of patient deterioration, and high numbers of monitoring alarms lead to alarm fatigue. We used machine learning to develop an early-warning system that integrates measurements from multiple organ systems using a high-resolution database with 240 patient-years of data. It predicts 90% of circulatory-failure events in the test set, with 82% identified more than 2 h in advance, resulting in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.63. On average, the system raises 0.05 alarms per patient and hour. The model was externally validated in an independent patient cohort. Our model provides early identification of patients at risk for circulatory failure with a much lower false-alarm rate than conventional threshold-based systems. A machine-learning algorithm based on an array of demographic, physiological and clinical information is able to predict, hours in advance, circulatory failure of patients in the intensive-care unit."

https://openalex.org/W3009460750,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition is increasingly widespread in medical and commercial devices, necessitating the development of automated interpretation strategies. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to automatically analyze ECG tracings and outperform physicians in detecting certain rhythm irregularities1. However, deep learning classifiers are susceptible to adversarial examples, which are created from raw data to fool the classifier such that it assigns the example to the wrong class, but which are undetectable to the human eye2,3. Adversarial examples have also been created for medical-related tasks4,5. However, traditional attack methods to create adversarial examples do not extend directly to ECG signals, as such methods introduce square-wave artefacts that are not physiologically plausible. Here we develop a method to construct smoothed adversarial examples for ECG tracings that are invisible to human expert evaluation and show that a deep learning model for arrhythmia detection from single-lead ECG6 is vulnerable to this type of attack. Moreover, we provide a general technique for collating and perturbing known adversarial examples to create multiple new ones. The susceptibility of deep learning ECG algorithms to adversarial misclassification implies that care should be taken when evaluating these models on ECGs that may have been altered, particularly when incentives for causing misclassification exist. The development of an algorithm that can imperceptibly manipulate electrocardiographic data to fool a deep learning model for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmia highlights the potential vulnerability of artificial intelligence-enabled diagnosis to adversarial attacks."
https://openalex.org/W3010191570,"Solute carriers (SLCs) are the largest family of transmembrane transporters in humans and are major determinants of cellular metabolism. Several SLCs have been shown to be required for the uptake of chemical compounds into cellular systems, but systematic surveys of transporter-drug relationships in human cells are currently lacking. We performed a series of genetic screens in a haploid human cell line against 60 cytotoxic compounds representative of the chemical space populated by approved drugs. By using an SLC-focused CRISPR-Cas9 library, we identified transporters whose absence induced resistance to the drugs tested. This included dependencies involving the transporters SLC11A2/SLC16A1 for artemisinin derivatives and SLC35A2/SLC38A5 for cisplatin. The functional dependence on SLCs observed for a significant proportion of the screened compounds suggests a widespread role for SLCs in the uptake and cellular activity of cytotoxic drugs and provides an experimentally validated set of SLC-drug associations for a number of clinically relevant compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3012384638,"Defining the biologically active structures of proteins in their cellular environments remains challenging for proteins with multiple conformations and functions, where only a minor conformer might be associated with a given function. Here, we use deep mutational scanning to probe the structure and dynamics of α-synuclein, a protein known to adopt disordered, helical and amyloid conformations. We examined the effects of 2,600 single-residue substitutions on the ability of intracellularly expressed α-synuclein to slow the growth of yeast. Computational analysis of the data showed that the conformation responsible for this phenotype is a long, uninterrupted, amphiphilic helix with increasing dynamics toward the C terminus. Deep mutational scanning can therefore determine biologically active conformations in cellular environments, even for a highly dynamic multi-conformational protein. Deep mutational scanning reveals that α-synuclein adopts a membrane-bound α-helix conformation with increasing dynamics towards the C terminus. This helical conformation is associated with its cytotoxicity."

In this regard, identifying the potential barriers and applying effective strategies for implementing respectful maternity care are essential. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of Iranian midwives regarding respectful maternity care during labor and childbirth. This was a qualitative study which was conducted from September-December 2018 in two non-teaching public hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with midwives, who had more than one year work experience in labor and childbirth units, through a purposive sampling method. A content analysis approach was used to analyze the data and identify themes. Three themes were extracted including “showing empathy”, “women-centered care” and “protecting rights”. Showing empathy reflects that “establishing a friendly relationship” and “being with women”. Women-centered care encompassed “keeping women safe” and “participating in decision making”. Protecting rights reflected a need for “safeguarding dignity” as well as “giving equal care” and “preparing appropriate environment”. Iranian midwives considered respectful maternity care a broader concept than just preventing mistreatment. Providing supportive care through friendly interaction with women was the first step for providing respectful maternity care. Respectful care is also promoted by providing safe care, implementing evidence-based care and involving women in their care as well as by providing an appropriate environment for women, families and caregivers."

https://openalex.org/W3012418072,"The mechanisms underpinning maternal metabolic adaptations to a healthy pregnancy and in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolated from healthy pregnant women promote islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and peripheral insulin resistance in nonpregnant mice and that sEVs from GDM women fail to stimulate insulin secretion and cause exacerbated insulin resistance. Small EVs were isolated from plasma of nonpregnant, healthy pregnant, and GDM women at 24-28 weeks of gestation. We developed a novel approach in nonpregnant mice involving a mini-osmotic pump for continuous 4-day jugular venous infusion of sEVs and determined their effects on glucose tolerance in vivo and islets and skeletal muscle in vitro. Fasting insulin was elevated in mice infused with pregnant sEVs as compared to sEVs from nonpregnant and GDM women. Mice infused with sEVs from GDM women developed glucose intolerance. GSIS was increased in mice infused with healthy pregnancy sEVs compared to mice receiving nonpregnant sEVs. GSIS and muscle basal insulin signaling, and insulin responsiveness were attenuated in mice infused with GDM sEVs. sEVs represent a novel mechanism regulating maternal glucose homeostasis in pregnancy and we speculate that altered sEV content contributes to the development of GDM."
https://openalex.org/W3011489562,"Microplastic fibers (MFs) pollute aquatic habitats globally via sewage release, stormwater runoff, or atmospheric deposition. Of the synthetic MFs, polyester (PES) and polypropylene (PP) are the most common. Field studies show that fish ingest large quantities of MFs. However, few laboratory studies have addressed host responses, particularly at the organ and tissue levels. Adult Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), a laboratory model fish, were exposed to aqueous concentrations of PES or PP MFs (10,000 MFs/L) for 21 days. Medaka egested 1,367 ± 819 PES MFs (0.1 ± 0.04 mg) and 157 ± 105 PP MFs (1.4 ± 0.06 mg) per 24 hrs, with PP egestion increasing over time. Exposure did not result in changes in body condition, gonadosomatic- or hepatosomatic indices. PES exposure resulted in no reproductive changes, but females exposed to PP MFs produced more eggs over time. MF exposure did not affect embryonic mortality, development, or hatching. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of gills revealed denuding of epithelium on arches, fusion of primary lamellae, and increased mucus. Histologic sections revealed aneurysms in secondary lamellae, epithelial lifting, and swellings of inner opercular membrane that altered morphology of rostral most gill lamellae. SEM and histochemical analyses showed increased mucous cells and secretions on epithelium of foregut; however, overt abrasions with sloughing of cells were absent. For these reasons, increased focus at the tissue and cell levels proved necessary to appreciate toxicity associated with MFs."

https://openalex.org/W3009339608,"Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury causes cognitive deficits, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and brain edema. Vitamin K2 (Menaquinone 4, MK-4) as a potent antioxidant can be a good candidate to ameliorate I/R consequences. This study focused on the neuroprotective effects of MK-4 for cerebral I/R insult in rat's hippocampus. The rat model of cerebral I/R was generated by transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 20 min. Rats were divided into control, I/R, I/R+DMSO (solvent (1% v/v)) and I/R+MK-4 treated (400 mg/kg, i.p.) groups. Twenty-four hours after I/R injury induction, total brain water content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, nitrate/nitrite concentration and neuronal density were evaluated. In addition to quantify the apoptosis processes, TUNEL staining, as well as expression level of Bax and Bcl2, were assessed. To evaluate astrogliosis and induced neurotoxicity by I/R GFAP and GLT-1 mRNA expression level were quantified. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured. Seven days post I/R, behavioral analysis to quantify cognitive function, as well as Nissl staining for surviving neuronal evaluation, were conducted. The findings indicated that administration of MK-4 following I/R injury improved anxiety-like behavior, short term and spatial learning and memory impairment induced by I/R. Also, MK-4 was able to diminish the increased total brain water content, apoptotic cell density, Bax/ Bcl2 ratio and GFAP mRNA expression following I/R. In addition, the high level of nitrate/nitrite, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α induced by I/R was reduced after MK-4 administration. However, MK-4 promotes the level of SOD activity and GLT-1 mRNA expression in I/R rat model. The findings demonstrated that MK-4 can rescue transient global cerebral I/R consequences via its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress features. MK-4 administration ameliorates neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity and neuronal cell death processes and leads to neuroprotection."

https://openalex.org/W3010577680,"Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are a newly discovered class of signaling lipids with anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties. However, the endogenous regulation of FAHFAs remains a pressing but unanswered question. Here, using MS-based FAHFA hydrolysis assays, LC-MS–based lipidomics analyses, and activity-based protein profiling, we found that androgen-induced gene 1 (AIG1) and androgen-dependent TFPI-regulating protein (ADTRP), two threonine hydrolases, control FAHFA levels in vivo in both genetic and pharmacologic mouse models. Tissues from mice lacking ADTRP (Adtrp-KO), or both AIG1 and ADTRP (DKO) had higher concentrations of FAHFAs particularly isomers with the ester bond at the 9th carbon due to decreased FAHFA hydrolysis activity. The levels of other lipid classes were unaltered indicating that AIG1 and ADTRP specifically hydrolyze FAHFAs. Complementing these genetic studies, we also identified a dual AIG1/ADTRP inhibitor, ABD-110207, which is active in vivo. Acute treatment of WT mice with ABD-110207 resulted in elevated FAHFA levels, further supporting the notion that AIG1 and ADTRP activity control endogenous FAHFA levels. However, loss of AIG1/ADTRP did not mimic the changes associated with pharmacologically administered FAHFAs on extent of upregulation of FAHFA levels, glucose tolerance, or insulin sensitivity in mice, indicating that therapeutic strategies should weigh more on FAHFA administration. Together, these findings identify AIG1 and ADTRP as the first endogenous FAHFA hydrolases identified and provide critical genetic and chemical tools for further characterization of these enzymes and endogenous FAHFAs to unravel their physiological functions and roles in health and disease.

https://openalex.org/W3010580300,"Lipopolysaccharide O-antigen is an attractive candidate for immunotherapeutic strategies targeting antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Several K. pneumoniae O-serotypes are based on a shared O2a-antigen backbone repeating unit: (→ 3)-α-Galp-(1 → 3)-β-Galf-(1 →). O2a antigen is synthesized on undecaprenol diphosphate in a pathway involving the O2a polymerase, WbbM, before its export by an ATP-binding cassette transporter. This dual domain polymerase possesses a C-terminal galactopyranosyltransferase resembling known GT8 family enzymes, and an N-terminal DUF4422 domain identified here as a galactofuranosyltransferase defining a previously unrecognized family (GT111). Functional assignment of DUF4422 explains how galactofuranose is incorporated into various polysaccharides of importance in vaccine production and the food industry. In the 2.1-Å resolution structure, three WbbM protomers associate to form a flattened triangular prism connected to a central stalk that orients the active sites toward the membrane. The biochemical, structural and topological properties of WbbM offer broader insight into the mechanisms of assembly of bacterial cell-surface glycans. Structural characterization of WbbM, an enzyme involved in O2a-antigen biosynthesis in Klebsiella pneumoniae, reveals two unique active sites with galactopyranosyl- or galactofuranosyl-transferase activities for oligosaccharide polymerization."

https://openalex.org/W3009615913,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are high-profile in the field of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). EMT-shifted CTCs are considered to encompass pre-metastatic subpopulations though underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Our previous work identified tissue factor (TF) as an EMT-induced gene providing tumor cells with coagulant properties and supporting metastatic colonization by CTCs. We here report that vimentin, the type III intermediate filament considered a canonical EMT marker, contributes to TF regulation and positively supports coagulant properties and early metastasis. Different evidence further pointed to a new post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of TF mRNA by vimentin: (1) vimentin silencing accelerated TF mRNA decay after actinomycin D treatment, reflecting TF mRNA stabilization, (2) RNA immunoprecipitation revealed enriched levels of TF mRNA in vimentin immunoprecipitate, (3) TF 3'-UTR-luciferase reporter vector assays implicated the 3'-UTR of TF mRNA in vimentin-dependent TF regulation, and (4) using different TF 3'UTR-luciferase reporter vectors mutated for potential miR binding sites and specific Target Site Blockers identified a key miR binding site in vimentin-dependent TF mRNA regulation. All together, these data support a novel mechanism by which vimentin interferes with a miR-dependent negative regulation of TF mRNA, thereby promoting coagulant activity and early metastasis of vimentin-expressing CTCs."
https://openalex.org/W3011796477,"Saliva represents an ideal matrix for diagnostic biomarker development as it is readily available and requires no invasive collection procedures. However, salivary RNA is labile and rapidly degrades. Previous attempts to isolate RNA from saliva have yielded poor quality and low concentrations. Here we compare collection and processing methods and propose an approach for future studies. The effects of RNA stabilisers, storage temperatures, length of storage and fasting windows were investigated on pooled saliva samples from healthy volunteers. Isolated RNA was assessed for concentration and quality. Bacterial growth was investigated through RT-PCR using bacterial and human primers. Optimal conditions were implemented and quality controlled in a clinical setting. The addition of RNAlater increased mean RNA yield from 4912 ng/μl to 15,473 ng and RNA Integrity Number (RIN) from 4.5 to 7.0. No significant changes to RNA yield were observed for storage at room temperature beyond 1 day or at -80 °C. Bacterial growth did not occur in samples stored at ambient temperature for up to a week. There was a trend towards higher RNA concentration when saliva was collected after overnight fasting but no effect on RIN. In the clinic, RNA yields of 6307 ng and RINs of 3.9 were achieved, improving on previous reports. The method we describe here is a robust, clinically feasible saliva collection method using preservative that gives high concentrations and improved RINs compared to saliva collected without preservative."
https://openalex.org/W3010605208,"Background We described safety and functional one-year follow-up outcomes of individuals with lower limb amputation treated with bone-anchored prostheses using titanium press-fit osseointegration implants. Methods All consecutive individuals treated between March 2015 and June 2018 with curved osseointegration femur implant (OFI-C) indicated for a long femoral remnant, gamma osseointegration femur implant (OFI-Y) indicated for a short femoral remnant, or osseointegration tibia implant (OTI) were eligible for this study. All adverse events were evaluated, infections were graded as follows: grade 1 and 2: low- and high-grade soft tissue infection, respectively, grade 3: deep bone infection, grade 4: septic implant failure. Functional outcome measures included prosthesis wearing time (PUS), health-related quality of life (GS), and the overall situation as an amputee (GS Q3); evaluated with the Questionnaire of persons with trans-femoral amputation (Q-TFA) before surgery and at one-year follow-up. Results Ninety of 91 individuals were included (mean age: 54±14 yrs, 26 females); treated with 53, 16 and 21 OFI-C, OFI-Y and OTI, respectively. Soft tissue infections (grade 1: 11 events, grade 2: 10 events) were treated successfully with antibiotics except in two (OFI-C and OFI-Y), who required additional surgery due to recurrent stoma irritation and peri-stoma abscess drainage. One individual with dysvascular amputation (OTI) developed septic implant loosening and occlusion of the femoral artery resulting in a transfemoral amputation. No aseptic loosening’s occurred. One individual (OFI-Y) required stoma surgical refashioning due to soft tissue redundancy. At baseline mean ±SD and median (25th to 75th PCTL) Q-TFA PUS and GS were 52±39, 52(7–90) and 40±19, 42(25–50) and improved significantly to 88±18, 90 (90–100) and 71±15, 75 (67–83) at one-year follow-up. The GS Q3 improved over time. Conclusion Titanium osseointegration implants can be safely used within a one-year follow-up period. The performance improved compared to the use of a socket-suspended prosthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3012519247,"The evolutionary changes in immune profiles of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are not well understood, although it is known that immune checkpoint inhibitors have diminished activity in heavily pre-treated TNBC patients. This study was designed to characterize immune profile changes of longitudinal tumor specimens by studying immune subsets of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in paired primary and metastatic TNBC in a cohort of ""poor outcome"" (relapsed within 5 years) patients. Immune profiles of TNBCs in a cohort of ""good outcome"" (no relapse within 5 years) patients were also analyzed. Immune subsets were characterized for CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD20, CD33, and PD1 using immuno-fluorescence staining in stroma, tumor, and combined stroma and tumor tissue. TIL subsets in ""good outcome"" versus ""poor outcome"" patients were also analyzed. Compared with primary, metastatic TNBCs had significantly lower TILs by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Stromal TILs (sTILs), but not tumoral TILs (tTILs) had significantly reduced cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs), PD1+ CTLs, and total PD1+ TILs in metastatic compared with matched primary TNBCs. Higher PD1+ CTLs, PD1+CD4+ helper T cells (PD1+TCONV) and all PD1+ T cells in sTILs, tTILs and total stromal and tumor TILS (s+tTIL) were all associated with better prognosis. In summary, TIL subsets decrease significantly in metastatic TNBCs compared with matched primary. Higher PD1+ TILs are associated with better prognosis in early stage TNBCs. This finding supports the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors early in the treatment of TNBCs."
https://openalex.org/W3011102471,"Mammalian skeletal muscles comprise different types of muscle fibers, and this muscle fiber heterogeneity is generally characterized by the expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. A switch in MyHC expression leads to muscle fiber–type transition under various physiological and pathological conditions, but the underlying regulator coordinating the switch of MyHC expression remains largely unknown. Experiments reported in this study revealed the presence of a skeletal muscle–specific antisense transcript generated from the intergenic region between porcine MyHC IIa and IIx and is referred to here as MyHC IIA/X-AS. We found that MyHC IIA/X-AS is identified as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is strictly expressed in skeletal muscles and is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm. Genetic analysis disclosed that MyHC IIA/X-AS stimulates cell cycle exit of skeletal satellite cells and their fusion into myotubes. Moreover, we observed that MyHC IIA/X-AS is more enriched in fast-twitch muscle and represses slow-type gene expression and thereby maintains the fast phenotype. Furthermore, we found that MyHC IIA/X-AS acts as a competing endogenous RNA that sponges microRNA-130b (miR-130b) and thereby maintains MyHC IIx expression and the fast fiber type. We also noted that miR-130b was proved to down-regulate MyHC IIx by directly targeting its 3′-UTR.

https://openalex.org/W3009750257,"Caveolin-1 (CAV1) enhanced migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells is inhibited by co-expression of the glycoprotein E-cadherin. Although the two proteins form a multiprotein complex that includes β-catenin, it remained unclear how this would contribute to blocking the metastasis promoting function of CAV1. Here, we characterized by mass spectrometry the protein composition of CAV1 immunoprecipitates from B16F10 murine melanoma cells expressing or not E-cadherin. The novel protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14 was identified by mass spectrometry analysis exclusively in co-immunoprecipitates of CAV1 with E-cadherin. Interestingly, PTPN14 is implicated in controlling metastasis, but only few known PTPN14 substrates exist. We corroborated by western blotting experiments that PTPN14 and CAV1 co-inmunoprecipitated in the presence of E-cadherin in B16F10 melanoma and other cancer cells. Moreover, the CAV1(Y14F) mutant protein was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with PTPN14 even in the absence of E-cadherin, and overexpression of PTPN14 reduced CAV1 phosphorylation on tyrosine-14, as well as suppressed CAV1-enhanced cell migration, invasion and Rac-1 activation in B16F10, metastatic colon [HT29(US)] and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines. Finally, PTPN14 overexpression in B16F10 cells reduced the ability of CAV1 to induce metastasis in vivo. In summary, we identify here CAV1 as a novel substrate for PTPN14 and show that overexpression of this phosphatase suffices to reduce CAV1-induced metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3010479634,"The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a ubiquitin ligase that initiates anaphase and mitotic exit. APC/C is activated by Cdc20 and inhibited by the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which delays mitotic exit when the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is activated. We previously identified apcin as a small molecule ligand of Cdc20 that inhibits APC/CCdc20 and prolongs mitosis. Here we find that apcin paradoxically shortens mitosis when SAC activity is high. These opposing effects of apcin arise from targeting of a common binding site in Cdc20 required for both substrate ubiquitination and MCC-dependent APC/C inhibition. Furthermore, we found that apcin cooperates with p31comet to relieve MCC-dependent inhibition of APC/C. Apcin therefore causes either net APC/C inhibition, prolonging mitosis when SAC activity is low, or net APC/C activation, shortening mitosis when SAC activity is high, demonstrating that a small molecule can produce opposing biological effects depending on regulatory context."

Exopolysaccharides are key structural components of this matrix and are required for the assembly and architecture of biofilms produced by a wide variety of microorganisms. The human bacterial pathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica produce a biofilm matrix composed primarily of the exopolysaccharide phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellulose. Once thought to be composed of only underivatized cellulose, the pEtN modification present in these matrices has been implicated in the overall architecture and integrity of the biofilm. However, an understanding of the mechanism underlying pEtN derivatization of the cellulose exopolysaccharide remains elusive. The bacterial cellulose synthase subunit G (BcsG) is a predicted inner membrane–localized metalloenzyme that has been proposed to catalyze the transfer of the pEtN group from membrane phospholipids to cellulose. Here we present evidence that the C-terminal domain of BcsG from E. coli (EcBcsGΔN) functions as a phosphoethanolamine transferase in vitro with substrate preference for cellulosic materials. Structural characterization of EcBcsGΔN revealed that it belongs to the alkaline phosphatase superfamily, contains a Zn2+ ion at its active center, and is structurally similar to characterized enzymes that confer colistin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. Informed by our structural studies, we present a functional complementation experiment in E. coli AR3110, indicating that the activity of the BcsG C-terminal domain is essential for integrity of the pellicular biofilm.

The bacterial cellulose synthase subunit G (BcsG) is a predicted inner membrane–localized metalloenzyme that has been proposed to catalyze the transfer of the pEtN group from membrane phospholipids to cellulose. Here we present evidence that the C-terminal domain of BcsG from E. coli (EcBcsGΔN) functions as a phosphoethanolamine transferase in vitro with substrate preference for cellulosic materials. Structural characterization of EcBcsGΔN revealed that it belongs to the alkaline phosphatase superfamily, contains a Zn2+ ion at its active center, and is structurally similar to characterized enzymes that confer colistin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. Informed by our structural studies, we present a functional complementation experiment in E. coli AR3110, indicating that the activity of the BcsG C-terminal domain is essential for integrity of the pellicular biofilm. Furthermore, our results established a similar but distinct active-site architecture and catalytic mechanism shared between BcsG and the colistin resistance enzymes."

This study seeks to evaluate whether a simulation based Difficult Conversations Workshop for neonatal nurse practitioners leads to improved skills in conducting difficult conversations.We performed a randomized controlled study of a simulation based Difficult Conversations Workshop for neonatal nurse practitioners (n = 13) in a regional level IV neonatal intensive care unit to test the hypothesis that this intervention would improve communication skills. A simulated test conversation was performed after the workshop by the intervention group and before the workshop by the control group. Two independent blinded content experts scored each conversation using a quantitative communication skills performance checklist and by assigning an empathy score. Standard statistical analysis was performed.Randomization occurred as follows: n = 5 to the intervention group, n = 7 to the control group. All participants were analyzed in each group. Participation in the simulation based Difficult Conversations Workshop increases participants' empathy score (p = 0.015) and the use of communication skills (p = 0.013) in a simulated clinical encounter.Our study demonstrates that a lecture and simulation based Difficult Conversations Workshop for neonatal nurse practitioners improves objective communication skills and empathy in conducting difficult conversations."

Methods This retrospective cohort study included PWS identified from a representative sample of 1/97th of the French population (general sample of beneficiaries). PWS were identified from 2014 data by an algorithm that included: F2 diagnostic codes in the register of long-term diseases in 2014 AND {(at least three deliveries of antipsychotics in 2014) OR (F20 diagnostic codes as a main or associated diagnosis in hospital discharge abstracts in 2012 or 2013 (hospital data for medicine, surgery and obstetrics)}. Follow-up dental care was explored for all people over a period of 3 years (2014 to 2017). Results In 2014, 580,219 persons older than 15 years were identified from the 96 metropolitan departments in France; 2,213 were PWS (0.4%). Fewer PWS were found along a diagonal line from north-east to south-west France, and the highest numbers were located in urban departments. PWS were more often male (58.6% vs 48.7%, p<0.001). They were less likely to have had tooth scaling but more likely to have undergone a dental extraction. In one third of departments, more than 50% of PWS had at least one tooth scaling over a three-year period; the rate of dental extraction in these departments ranged from 6 to 23%. Then, a quarter of the departments in which 40 to 100% of PWS had had at least one dental extraction (2/8) presented a rate of tooth scaling ranging from 0 to 28% over the study period. Conclusions Compared with the general population, PWS were less likely to have had tooth scaling and dental treatment but more likely to have undergone dental extraction."

Emerging evidence suggests that CPSF6 also plays key roles in HIV-1 infection, specifically during nuclear import and integration targeting. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate CPSF6 expression are largely unknown. In this study, we report a post-transcriptional mechanism that regulates CPSF6 via the cellular microRNA miR-125b. An in silico analysis revealed that the 3′UTR of CPSF6 contains a miR-125b–binding site that is conserved across several mammalian species. Because miRNAs repress protein expression, we tested the effects of miR-125b expression on CPSF6 levels in miR-125b knockdown and over-expression experiments, revealing that miR-125b and CPSF6 levels are inversely correlated. To determine whether miR-125b post-transcriptionally regulates CPSF6, we introduced the 3′UTR of CPSF6 mRNA into a luciferase reporter and found that miR-125b negatively regulates CPSF6 3′UTR-driven luciferase activity. Accordingly, mutations in the miR-125b seed sequence abrogated the regulatory effect of the miRNA on the CPSF6 3′UTR. Finally, pulldown experiments demonstrated that miR-125b physically interacts with CPSF6 3′UTR. Interestingly, HIV-1 infection down-regulated miR-125b expression concurrent with up-regulation of CPSF6. Notably, miR-125b down-regulation in infected cells was not due to reduced pri-miRNA or pre-miRNA levels.

Despite the established role of CPSF6 in mRNA processing and HIV-1 infection, the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) by which CPSF6 expression is regulated remains largely unknown. In this study, we describe an miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional mechanism of CPSF6 regulation. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that the CPSF6 3′UTR contains a binding site for the cellular miRNA miR-125b. This binding site is strikingly conserved across a number of mammalian species implying a regulatory role of this miRNA. Therefore, we examined miR-125b–mediated regulation of CPSF6 by carrying out knockdown and over-expression studies. Results from these genetic experiments revealed that miR-125b levels negatively associate with CPSF6 protein expression. To further pinpoint post-transcriptional regulation of CPSF6 by miR-125b, luciferase reporter constructs containing the 3′UTR sequences of CPSF6 mRNA were generated. Luciferase assays revealed that CPSF6 3′UTR activity is negatively regulated by miR-125b expression. Subsequently, physical interaction between the CPSF6 3′UTR and miR-125b was demonstrated by pulldown studies. Interestingly, upon HIV-1 infection, miR-125b levels were reduced concurrent with increased CPSF6 expression. The down-regulation of miR-125b in infected cells was not due to reduced levels of miR-125b precursors such as pre-miRNA or pri-miRNA. Interestingly, our results revealed that miR-125b down-regulation depended on reverse transcription of the viral genome but not on viral DNA integration. Finally, over-expression and knockdown of miR-125b in infected cells showed that the miR predominantly affected nuclear entry of HIV-1. Collectively, these studies describe: (a) post-transcriptional regulation of CPSF6, (b) identify CFSP6 as a direct target of miR-125b, (c) establish effects of miR-125b on early steps of HIV-1 infection, and (d) reveal a potential mechanism by which HIV-1 regulates miR-125b expression during early steps of infection. CPSF6 is part of the CFIm complex and is well-established for its role in polyadenylation of cellular mRNAs (3Hardy J.G. Norbury C.J.

Interestingly, both platforms predicted a putative miR-125b–binding site within the CPSF6 3′UTR (Fig. 1, B and C). These studies also showed the formation of a hairpin-loop structure between the two RNA molecules that is essential for miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation (Fig. 1, B and C). The 7-mer target site of miR-125b was located at nucleotide positions 2204–2211 of the CPSF6 mRNA within exon 10, corresponding to positions 471–477 of the 3′UTR (Fig. 1A). Importantly, the predicted miR-125b target sequence was highly conserved in the CPSF6 3′UTR of several mammalian species (Fig. 1D), another hallmark of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation (34Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function.Cell. 2004; 116 (14744438): 281-29710.1016/S0092-8674(04)00045-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28235) Google Scholar). To examine the biological relevance of the in silico prediction data described in Fig. 1, A–D, we tested whether miR-125b regulates CPSF6 protein expression in knockdown and over-expression studies. We transfected locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based miR-125b mimics and anti-miRs into HEK-293T cells and isolated total RNA after 24 h. qPCR analysis of reverse transcribed RNA showed a significant reduction in miR-125b levels in cells transfected with anti-miRs (Fig. 1E) and a marked increase in miR-125b levels in cells transfected with miR mimics (Fig. 1F). Measurement of CPSF6 protein levels in cellular lysates by Western blotting showed that cells with lower levels of miR-125b contained higher CPSF6 protein levels compared with control cells (Fig. 1G). Accordingly, higher miR-125b levels led to a reduced level of CPSF6 protein (Fig. 1G), supporting an inverse association between miR-125b expression and CPSF6 protein levels. We also examined whether miR-125b expression negatively associates with CPSF6 protein levels in HIV-1 susceptible T and monocytic cell lines. SupT1 and CEM cell lines were specifically chosen as T cell models because SupT1 cells expressed miR-125b endogenously, whereas CEM cells contained very low or undetectable levels of miR-125b (Fig. 1H). Therefore, these two cell lines served as appropriate models for knockdown and over-expression studies, respectively. Knockdown of miR-125b was achieved by electroporation of anti-miRs into SupT1 cells (Fig. 1I) and over-expression of miR-125b was conducted in CEM cells using miR-125b mimics (Fig. 1J). Measurement of CPSF6 levels in SupT1 cells revealed that lower miR-125b levels were associated with higher CPSF6 protein (Fig. 1L). Conversely, increasing miR-125b levels resulted in a significant reduction in CPSF6 protein levels in CEM cells (Fig. 1M), consistent with the data obtained using HEK-293T cells (Fig. 1G). Similar inverse relationships between miR-125b and CPSF6 expression levels was also observed in THP1 monocytic cells (Fig. 1, K and N). Collectively, these results provide evidence that miR-125b levels inversely correlate with CPSF6 protein expression and support the in silico prediction of post-transcriptional regulation of CPSF6 by miR-125b. miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by usually binding to the 3′UTR of the target mRNA (35Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Filipowicz W. Repression of protein synthesis by miRNAs: how many mechanisms?.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17 (17197185): 118-12610.1016/j.tcb.2006.12.007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 36Li S.

Therefore, we probed whether miR-125b targets the 3′UTR of CPSF6 mRNA. To test this, we introduced the CPSF6 3′UTR into a luciferase reporter construct. Because the 3′UTR of CPSF6 is about 4.9 kb (Fig. 2A), we generated three truncated constructs that retained the miR-125b–binding site: 1) 3′UTR-small containing 1–1011 bp from the 5′-end (3′UTR-S); 2) 3′UTR-medium containing 1–3114 bp (3′UTR-M); and 3) 3′UTR-large containing 1–4243 bp (3′UTR-L) (Fig. 2A). These 3′UTR reporter constructs or a control plasmid lacking the 3′UTR (ΔUTR) were transfected individually into HEK-293T cells. At 24 h post-transfection, cellular lysates were prepared for luciferase activity measurements. The reporter constructs that harbored the miR-125b–binding site showed less luciferase activity compared with the control construct that lacked the binding site (Fig. 2B). Because HEK-293T cells express miR-125b (Fig. 1, A and B), the reduced luciferase activity observed with the CPSF6 3′UTR constructs is likely due to the effects of the endogenous miRs on the CPSF6 3′UTR of the reporter constructs. Each deletion construct supported a similar level of reduced luciferase activity (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with our in silico identification of the miR-125b–binding site within the upstream 1011-bp region of the 3′UTR (Figure 1, Figure 2A). We next co-transfected the CPSF6 3′UTR constructs individually with miR-mimics or anti-miRs. miR-125b expression in co-transfected cells was confirmed by qPCR (data not shown). Alterations in miR-125b levels by knockdown or over-expression minimally affected the luciferase activity of the control reporter that lacked the 3′UTR (ΔUTR) (Fig. 2C). However, in the presence of anti-miRs, a significant increase in luciferase activity was observed in the lysate of cells individually transfected with the three different CPSF6 3′UTR constructs (Fig. 2, D–F). Conversely, increasing miR-125b levels resulted in a decrease in the luciferase activity of the three 3′UTR-containing constructs (Fig. 2, D–F). The modest decrease in luciferase activity in miR-125b over-expressed cells could be due to competition between the endogenous CPSF6 3′UTR and the 3′UTR of the reporter constructs for binding to the miR-mimics. To address potential confounding effects from the 3′UTR of the endogenous CPSF6 mRNA, we next carried out co-transfection studies in CPSF6 knockout cells (29Sowd G.A. Serrao E. Wang H. Wang W. Fadel H.J. Poeschla E.M. Engelman A.N. A critical role for alternative polyadenylation factor CPSF6 in targeting HIV-1 integration to transcriptionally active chromatin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Western blot analysis confirmed lack of CPSF6 protein expression in the knockout HEK-293T (CKO) cells compared with CWT cells that expressed CPSF6 (Fig. 2G). Knockdown and over-expression studies in these cells revealed that altering miR-125b expression levels in CKO cells minimally affected the luciferase activity of the CPSF6 ΔUTR control construct (Fig. 2H), consistent with the data in Fig. 2C. Accordingly, co-transfection of the three CPSF6 3′UTR constructs individually along with anti-miRs also showed significant increases in luciferase activity in CKO cells (Fig. 2, I–K) akin to the results with CWT cells (Fig. 2, D–F). Conversely, over-expression of miR-125b greatly reduced CPSF6 3′UTR driven luciferase activity in CKO cells compared with the scrambled controls (Fig. 2, I–K). Collectively, these results provide further evidence that the CPSF6 3′UTR is negatively regulated by miR-125b expression. Our in silico studies identified that the miR-125b target site is located at nucleotides 2204–2211 of CPSF6 mRNA, corresponding to 471–477 positions within the 3′UTR (Fig. 1A). To determine the role of the genetic interaction between miR-125b and CPSF6 3′UTR in post-transcriptional regulation, we introduced specific mutations within the binding site. First, in silico mutational analyses revealed that introduction of two specific nucleotide substitutions CA > AT (Mut1) and CA > GT (Mut2) in the CPSF6 3′UTR would collapse the secondary structure formed by the interaction between the two RNA molecules (Fig. 3, A–C). Structural models also revealed that these mutations would reduce the stability and binding affinity between miR-125b and the CPSF6 3′UTR as measured by the mean free energy (Fig. 3, A–C). Therefore, we introduced these two specific substitutions into the CPSF6 3′UTR of the 3′UTR-S luciferase reporter construct by site-directed mutagenesis. Then, we studied the effects of miR-125b on the mutant 3′UTRs using the luciferase reporter assay. Transfection of the parental 3′UTR-S or mutant derivative (Mut1 and Mut2) constructs showed that the luciferase activity of the mutants was comparable with that of the CPSF6 ΔUTR control construct (Fig. 3, D and E). Importantly, co-transfecti"

Bivalve molluscs can accumulate DST via ingestion of toxic dinoflagellates like Dinophysis spp., which are the most prominent producers of DST. The effects of DST-containing dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuta on bivalve clearance and respiration rate were investigated in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) exposed to different algal densities in a controlled laboratory study. Results showed that M. edulis exposed to D. acuta displayed a reduced clearance rate compared to M. edulis exposed to equivalent bio-volumes of the non-toxic cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina. Furthermore, M. edulis ceased to feed on D. acuta after 1 to 4 h, depending on D. acuta densities. The quickest response was observed at the highest densities of D. acuta. The estimated total amount of DST accumulated in the M. edulis exceeded the regulatory limit for human consumption and furthermore, intoxication of the M. edulis seemed to occur faster at high cell toxicity rather than at high cell density. However, respiration rates were, similar, irrespective of whether M. edulis were fed single diets of R. salina, D. acuta or a mixed diet of both algal species. In conclusion, the DST-containing D. acuta had a severe negative effect on the clearance of M. edulis, which can affect the conditions of the M. edulis negatively. Hence, DST may cause low quality M. edulis, due to reduced feeding when exposed to DST-containing D. acuta."

This dual function is achieved by basic residues that alternately face either the membrane phospholipids or the intracellular milieu. This mechanism was supported by several experimental findings obtained using biochemical methods, electrophysiological measurements in Xenopus oocytes, and fluorescent microscopy of mammalian cells. First, a positively charged and highly conserved H4c residue, Arg108, was indispensable and crucial for metabolite transport. Furthermore, neutralization of other H4c basic residues inhibited slc13 transport function, thus mimicking the inhibitory effect of the slc13 inhibitor, slc26a6.

https://openalex.org/W3012442031,"The abilities of opioids to activate downstream signaling pathways normally depend on the binding between opioids and their receptors. However, opioids may also function in a receptor-independent manner, especially in neural stem cells (NSCs) in which the expression of opioid receptors and endogenous opioid agonists is low. When two opioids, morphine and naloxone, were used during the early stage of NSC differentiation, increased neurogenesis was observed. However, naloxone methiodide, a membrane impenetrable analog of naloxone, did not affect the NSC differentiation. The abilities of morphine and naloxone to facilitate neurogenesis were also observed in opioid receptor-knockout NSCs. Therefore, morphine and naloxone promote neurogenesis in a receptor-independent manner at least during the early stage. In addition, the receptor-independent functions of opioids were not observed in methylcytosine dioxygenase ten-eleven translocation 1 (Tet1) knockout NSCs. When the expression of opioid receptors increased and the expression of Tet1 decreased during the late stage of NSC differentiation, morphine, but not naloxone, inhibited neurogenesis via traditional receptor-dependent and miR181a-Prox1-Notch-related pathway. In summary, the current results demonstrated the time-dependent effects of opioids during the differentiation of NSCs and provided additional insight on the complex functions of opioids."

Researching these occurrences could help understand individual change processes in longitudinal data. Three criteria are generally used to identify sudden gains in psychological interventions. However, applying these criteria can be time consuming and prone to errors if not fully automated. Adaptations to these criteria and methodological decisions such as how multiple gains are handled vary across studies and are reported with different levels of detail. These problems limit the comparability of individual studies and make it hard to understand or replicate the exact methods used. The R package suddengains provides a set of tools to facilitate sudden gains research. This article illustrates how to use the package to identify sudden gains or sudden losses and how to extract descriptive statistics as well as exportable data files for further analysis. It also outlines how these analyses can be customised to apply adaptations of the standard criteria. The suddengains package therefore offers significant scope to improve the efficiency, reporting, and reproducibility of sudden gains research."

https://openalex.org/W3010460716,"Altered ecosystem variability is an important ecological response to disturbance yet understanding of how various attributes of disturbance regimes affect ecosystem variability is limited. To improve the framework for understanding the disturbance regime attributes that affect ecosystem variability, we examine how the introduction of stochasticity to disturbance parameters (frequency, severity and extent) alters simulated recovery when compared to deterministic outcomes from a spatially explicit simulation model. We also examine the agreement between results from empirical studies and deterministic and stochastic configurations of the model. We find that stochasticity in disturbance frequency and spatial extent leads to the greatest increase in the variance of simulated dynamics, although stochastic severity also contributes to departures from the deterministic case. The incorporation of stochasticity in disturbance attributes improves agreement between empirical and simulated responses, with 71% of empirical responses correctly classified by stochastic configurations of the model as compared to 47% using the purely deterministic model. By comparison, only 2% of empirical responses were correctly classified by the deterministic model and misclassified by stochastic configurations of the model. These results indicate that stochasticity in the attributes of a disturbance regime alters the patterns and classification of ecosystem variability, suggesting altered recovery dynamics. Incorporating stochastic disturbance processes into models may thus be critical for anticipating the ecological resilience of ecosystems."

The diffusion of innovations literature has often examined the characteristics of three sets of variables: the adopter, the change agent, and the innovation. This literature clearly establishes the crucial role of change agents in promoting an innovation. However, what we don't know is what makes change agents want to promote a particular innovation. In this study, change agents' perceptions of the attributes of two-stage drainage ditches, an innovative agricultural drainage ditch design, are examined in order to understand what affects their willingness to promote them. Diffusion of innovation theory provides the conceptual grounding as well as the theoretical motivation for this study. The data for this study come from semi-structured interviews with 17 change agents. Results suggest that change agents perceive the relative advantage associated with two-stage ditches to be low, and that two-stage ditches might be perceived by potential adopters to be incompatible with the prevalent sociocultural beliefs about drainage ditch management. Results also indicate that change agents' perceptions of environmental benefits of adopting two-stage ditches affects their willingness to promote them.

https://openalex.org/W3010414084,"Using an analysis of the uniaxial compression process of Datong coal samples, the change of transient charge signals on coal surfaces is observed, and the influence of sampling directions (perpendicular to bedding planes and parallel to bedding planes) on the transient charge signals is studied. The intensity in perpendicular to bedding planes is 4.6~10.2 MPa, parallel to bedding planes is 2.1~5.3 MPa. The results show that the change of the charge signals on sample surfaces is instantaneous and pulsing, and such a change is always in accord with stress change and the alternation of positive and negative charge occurring over a short time period. Under uniaxial compression, the surface charge signal characteristics of coal sample in perpendicular to and parallel to the bedding are different. With a higher value of limiting stress, the transient charge signals on coal sample surfaces perpendicular to the bedding exhibit higher strength than those of coal samples oriented parallel to the bedding. However, the number of signal pulses during the failure process, for the samples perpendicular to the bedding, is less than that for the samples oriented parallel to the bedding. According to the variation law for transient charge signals on coal surfaces, we conclude that changes in the transient charge can serve as a tool to characterize crack propagation within coal specimens and provide an important reference for the prediction of coal and rock dynamic disasters."

CDC depends on several factors, including the availability and activity of the complement classical pathway (CP). Recently, a significant decrease in CP activity was shown to be associated with an immunoglobulin-C5a complex (Ig-C5a) and other markers of chronic CP activation in 40% of the patients. The study focused on the involvement of IgG-hexamers, an established CP activator, in the mechanism of chronic CP activation in CLL. Sera from 51 naïve CLL patients and 20 normal controls were collected. CP and alternative pathway (AP) activities were followed by the complement activity marker sC5b-9. Serum high molecular weight (HMW) proteins were collected by gel-filtration chromatography and their complement activation capacity was assessed. The levels of IgM, another established CP activator, were measured. Data were associated with the presence of Ig-C5a. Baseline levels of activation markers negatively correlated with CP and the AP activities, supporting chronic complement activation. In patients with Ig-C5a, HMW proteins that are not IgM, activated the complement. HMW proteins were identified as IgG-aggregates by affinity binding assays and Western blot analysis. The data indicate chronic CP activation, mediated by cell-free IgG-hexamers as a cause of decreased CP activity in part of the CLL population. This mechanism may affect immunotherapy outcomes due to compromised CP activity and CDC."
https://openalex.org/W3009977907,"Sodium Calcium exchanger (NCX) proteins utilize the electrochemical gradient of Na+ to generate Ca2+ efflux (forward mode) or influx (reverse mode). In mammals, there are three unique NCX encoding genes-NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3, that comprise the SLC8A family, and mRNA from all three exchangers is expressed in hippocampal pyramidal cells. Furthermore, mutant ncx2-/- and ncx3-/- mice have each been shown to exhibit altered long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region due to delayed Ca2+ clearance after depolarization that alters synaptic transmission. In addition to the role of NCX at the synapse of hippocampal subfields required for LTP, the three NCX isoforms have also been shown to localize to the dendrite of hippocampal pyramidal cells. In the case of NCX1, it has been shown to localize throughout the basal and apical dendrite of CA1 neurons where it helps compartmentalize Ca2+ between dendritic shafts and spines. Given the role for NCX and calcium in synaptic plasticity, the capacity of NCX splice-forms to influence backpropagating action potentials has clear consequences for the induction of spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP). To explore this, we examined the effect of NCX localization, density, and allosteric activation on forward and back propagating signals and, next employed a STDP paradigm to monitor the effect of NCX on plasticity using back propagating action potentials paired with EPSPs. From our simulation studies we identified a role for the sodium calcium exchange current in normalizing STDP, and demonstrate that NCX is required at the postsynaptic site for this response. We also screened other mechanisms in our model and identified a role for the Ca2+ activated K+ current at the postsynapse in producing STDP responses. Together, our data reveal opposing roles for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger current and the Ca2+ activated K+ current in setting STDP."
