https://openalex.org/W2034614517,"A SERIES of papers by Bruce and colleagues1–4 has described a pre-implantation block to pregnancy in non-inbred laboratory mice which is evoked by the presence of strange males of the same strain or of a different strain (‘alien’ males). This effect is olfactory-mediated. The phenomenon has also been reported in another species, non-inbred prairie deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii)5."

https://openalex.org/W2017318798,"THE most striking difference between the skin of essential fatty acids deficient mice and that of normal mice is the number of layers of cells in the epidermis; the epidermis of essential fatty acids deficient mice is nearly three times thicker than normal1. A similar difference has been found in the skin of rats kept on a fat-free diet2. The greater thickness of the epidermis under these dietary conditions could conceivably have resulted from either: (a) a decrease in the rate of epidermal keratinization and cell sloughing; (b) an increase in the rate of cellular proliferation; or (c) a combination of these. The accumulation of abnormally large amounts of lipid in the cells of the distal epidermal layers of essential fatty acids deficient mice1 suggested that these cells may, indeed, keratinize and slough at a slower rate than normal. The mitotic indices of the epidermis of normal and essential fatty acids deficient mice are compared in the present communication in an effort to deal with the second and third of the possible explanations for epidermal thickening."

https://openalex.org/W2012938382,"IN the course of the search for the hormone which results in inhibition of gastric secretion and motility after fat has entered the duodenum, the ability of duodenal extracts to inhibit the motility of denervated gastric pouches has become crucial. The presence of fat in the duodenum inhibits the spontaneous motility of Heidenhain pouches1, but many duodenal extracts which inhibit acid secretion will not do this. Extracts of duodenal mucosa containing secretin2 and even more conclusively extracts containing cholecystokinin/pancreozymin3 inhibit gastric acid secretion."

While examining the effects of drugs on the extra-ocular muscles, it was observed that succinylcholine exerted two basically different effects on the extra-ocular muscles."

https://openalex.org/W2082225903,"IN view of the successful removal of protein-containing material from carbohydrates1 and from nucleic acids2 by extraction with phenol, we have attempted by this means to remove the protein which remains associated with hyaluronic acid when the latter is prepared from ox synovial fluid by filtration3,4. Solutions were extracted at 0°–2° with phenol to give about equal volumes of the phenol and water-rich phases. Phenol was removed from the water-rich phase by extraction with diethyl ether or by dialysis."

https://openalex.org/W2052353936,"IN previous papers an increase of the RNA content in the serum of rabbits immunized with horse serum albumin and rat or guinea-pig red blood cells was observed; the greatest increase was in the gamma-globulin fraction. The RNA extracted from immune rabbit sera (RNA Immuno-Carrier or RNA-I-C) was able to induce in normal rabbits a precocious antibody production against the same antigens used for immunizing the animals' source of the RNA1,2."
https://openalex.org/W2025218647,"DURING their work on the effect of ultrasonic waves on the hatching of Aedes aegypti eggs Quraishi et al.1 found an interesting pattern of hatching in the controls. Aedes aegypti eggs laid overnight were kept in water in Petri dishes and the percentage of larvae hatching out each day was recorded for 20 days. On the first day 2.5 per cent of the eggs hatched out; on the second day this percentage was 13, the highest recorded for any single day. The percentage of eggs hatching out gradually decreased after the second day, until after the 13th day, when there was an upward trend in hatching, and a small peak was discernible between the 14th and 16th days. There was a sudden fall in the number of eggs hatching out after the 16th day and by the 20th day only 62.5 per cent of the eggs hatched out. Thus 37.5 per cent of apparently normal eggs were left unhatched. We therefore decided to follow the hatching pattern of Aedes aegypti eggs for 50 days."
