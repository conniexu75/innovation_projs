https://openalex.org/W2020827621,"The cDNA sequences encoding the central cannabinoid receptor, CB1, are known for two species, rat and human. However, little information concerning the flanking, noncoding regions is presently available. We have isolated two overlapping clones from a human lung cDNA library with CB1 cDNA inserts. One of these, cann7, contains a short stretch of the CB1 coding region and 4 kilobase pairs (kb) of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR), including two polyadenylation signals. The other, cann6, is identical to cann7 upstream from the first polyadenylation signal, and in addition, it contains the whole coding region and extends for 1.8 kb into the 5′-UTR. Comparison of cann6 with the published sequence (Gérard, C. M., Mollereau, C., Vassart, G., and Parmentier, M.(1991) Biochem. J. 279, 129-134) shows the coding regions to be identical, but reveals important differences in the flanking regions.

https://openalex.org/W2126168922,"Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc-dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, which contains two similar domains, each possessing a functional active site. Respective involvement of each active site in the degradation of the circulating peptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), a negative regulator of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, was studied by using wild-type recombinant ACE and two full-length mutants containing a single functional site. Both the N- and C-active sites of ACE exhibit dipeptidyl activity toward AcSDKP, with Km values of 31 and 39 μM, respectively. However, the N-active site hydrolyzes the peptide 50 times faster compared with the C-active site, with kcat/Km values of 0.5 and 0.01 μM-1•s-1, respectively. The predominant role of the N-active site in AcSDKP hydrolysis was confirmed by the inhibition of hydrolysis using a monoclonal antibody specifically directed against the N-active site. The N-domain specificity for AcSDKP will aid the identification of specific inhibitors for this domain.

INTRODUCTIONAngiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) 1The abbreviations used are: ACEangiotensin-converting enzymeLH-RHluteinizing hormone-releasing hormoneCHOChinese hamster ovaryHiphippurylHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographymAbmonoclonal antibodyAcSDKPN-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline. (peptidyl dipeptidase A, kininase II, EC 3.4.15.1) is a zinc-dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, which also displays endopeptidase activity on certain substrates. The primary specificity of ACE is to cleave C-terminal dipeptides from oligopeptide substrates with a free C terminus in the absence of a penultimate proline residue or a terminal dicarboxylic amino acid. ACE cleaves the C-terminal dipeptide from angiotensin I to produce the potent vasopressor octapeptide, angiotensin II(1Skeggs L.T. Kahn J.R. Shumway N.P. J. Exp. Med. 1956; 103: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and inactivates bradykinin by the sequential removal of two C-terminal dipeptides(2Yang H.Y.T. Erdös E.G. Levin Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 214: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The endopeptidase activity of ACE is observed with substrates that are amidated at their C termini where the enzyme cleaves a C-terminal dipeptide amide and/or a C-terminal tripeptide amide(3Erdös E.G. Hypertension. 1990; 16: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 4Hooper N.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An unexpected activity of ACE is observed on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) where ACE can cleave not only the C-terminal tripeptide amide but in addition the N-terminal tripeptide (5Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).There are two ACE isoforms: a somatic form of about 150-180 kDa found in endothelial, epithelial, and neuroepithelial cells and a smaller isoform of 90-110 kDa present only in male germinal cells. The somatic form of ACE is derived from a duplicated ancestral gene (6Hubert C. Houot A.M. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15377-15383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kumar R.S. Thekkumkara T.J. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3854-3862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is composed of two highly homologous domains called N- and C-domains, each comprising an active site that faces the extracellular surface of the cell(8Soubrier F. Alhenc-Gelas F. Hubert C. Allegrini J. John M. Tregear G. Corvol P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9386-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 9Bernstein K.E. Martin B.M. Edwards A.S. Bernstein E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11945-11951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the germinal form of ACE has revealed that it corresponds to the C-domain of somatic ACE with the exception of a short specific N-terminal sequence and therefore contains a single active site(10Lattion A.-L. Soubrier F. Allegrini J. Hubert C. Corvol P. Alhenc-Gelas F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 252: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Ehlers M.R.W. Fox E.A. Strydom D.J. Riordan J.F. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16754-16758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It was established previously that both putative active sites of the somatic enzyme were functional by constructing a series of ACE mutants (13Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that both domains exhibit similar catalytic activities toward the substrates angiotensin I, bradykinin, and substance P(14Jaspard E. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9496-9503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are some differences between the two functional domains of ACE. 1) The two active sites are differently activated by chloride ions. The C-terminal domain activity is highly dependent on chloride concentration, whereas the N-terminal domain is still active in the absence of chloride and is fully activated at relatively lower chloride concentrations(13Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jaspard E. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9496-9503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2) A number of specific ACE inhibitors display different potencies toward the two active sites(15Wei L. Clauser E. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13398-13405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3) The N-active site is preferentially involved in the N-terminal endopeptidase cleavage of LH-RH(14Jaspard E. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9496-9503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Km for this cleavage is rather high, and the catalytic efficiency is low; therefore, it is unlikely that this cleavage occurs in vivo. In fact, no specific substrate for the N-domain has been identified to date.The tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), isolated from fetal calf bone marrow(16Lenfant M. Wdzieczak-Bakala J. Guittet E. Prome J.C. Sotty D. Frindel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), is involved in the control of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation by preventing their recruitment into S-phase(17Frindel E. Guigon M. Exp Hematol. (N. Y.). 1977; 5: 74-76PubMed Google Scholar). AcSDKP appears to exert this function by blocking the action of a stem cell-specific proliferation stimulator (18Robinson S. Lenfant M. Wdzieczak-Bakala J. Melville J. Riches A. Cell Proliferation. 1992; 25: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and acts selectively on quiescent progenitors. The phase-specific anti-cancer drugs act on cycling cells and thus do not select between malignant cells and normal progenitors undergoing cytotoxic treatment. Therefore, administration of AcSDKP in conjunction with cytotoxic therapy offers a potential therapeutic application in selectively maintaining normal progenitors in the quiescent state(19Wdzieczak-Bakala J. Guigon M. Lenfant M. Frindel E. Biomed. & Pharmacother. 1983; 9: 467-471Google Scholar, 20Bogden A.E. Carde P. Deschamps de Paillette E. Moreau J.P. Tubiana M. Frindel E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 628: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Co-localization of AcSDKP and ACE in humans has been observed in plasma (21Liozon E. Pradelles P. Venot J. Rigaud M. Cransac M. Bordessoule D. Frindel E. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 808-812PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lanzillo J.J. Stevens J. Dasarathy Y. Yotsumoto H. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol.

Med. 1991; 117: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar) and in circulating mononuclear cells(24Pradelles P. Frobert Y. Creminon C. Liozon E. Masse A. Frindel E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 986-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Costerousse O. Allegrini J. Lopez M. Alhenc-Gelas F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Moreover, in mice, the presence of both AcSDKP and ACE was detected in bone marrow cells. 2A. Rousseau, A., Michaud, M.-T. Chauvet, M. Lenfant, and P. Corvol, unpublished results. These results suggest that ACE might be involved in the in vivo regulation of the local concentration of the hemoregulatory peptide AcSDKP. The inhibitory effect of AcSDKP depends on its half-life. Recently, it was shown that AcSDKP circulates in plasma and that ACE is involved in vitro in the initial and determinant catabolic step of AcSDKP hydrolysis(26Rieger K.J. Saez-Servent N. Papet M.P. Wdzieczak-Bakala J. Morgat J.L. Thierry J. Voelter W. Lenfant M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).In the present study, the respective activities of the wild-type membrane-bound recombinant human ACE and of two full-length ACE mutants in the degradation of AcSDKP were determined. The mutants contain one of the two active sites inactivated by substitution of the two zinc-binding histidines by lysyl residues and are referred to here as ACEK361,365 and ACEK959,963, corresponding to the C- and N-functional domains of ACE, respectively. This study reveals that the activity of wild-type ACE on AcSDKP hydrolysis is entirely attributable to its N-active site, a result confirmed by the complete inhibition of this hydrolysis by a monoclonal antibody specifically directed against the N-active site. Finally, the potency of specific ACE inhibitors on AcSDKP hydrolysis was evaluated and compared with that obtained on hydrolysis of a specific substrate of the C-active site of the enzyme.Altogether our data suggest that the N-terminal active site of ACE is specifically involved in the catabolism of AcSDKP, thus identifying the first potential physiological and specific substrate for this catalytic domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymesThree purified human recombinant ACE proteins have been studied from stably expressed CHO cells: wild-type membrane-bound recombinant ACE, which contains the two intact functional domains, and two full-length ACE mutants containing only one intact functional domain by the substitution of the two zinc-binding histidyl residues of either the C- or the N-domain by lysyl residues (ACEK361,365, ACEK959,963). The construction of the ACE cDNA containing the entire coding sequence for human endothelial ACE and of the two ACE mutants, and their expression in CHO cells has already been described(13Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of the corresponding proteins was performed according to Beldent et al.(27Beldent V. Michaud A. Wei L. Chauvet M.T. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26428-26434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the chromatographic steps have been replaced by centrifugation on an Ultrafree-MC membrane 100,000 PMNL (Millipore Corp.).The enzymatic activities of the three recombinant enzymes were assayed using hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (Hip-His-Leu) as substrate as described by Cushman and Cheung (28Cushman D.W. Cheung H.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 1637-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar) and quantified as described previously(29Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Soubrier F. Michaud A. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5540-5546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACE concentrations were quantified by direct RIA (30Alhenc-Gelas F. Weare J.A. Johnson R.L.J. Erdös E.G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 101: 83-96Google Scholar) or were deduced from their enzymatic activities.PeptideThe tetrapeptide AcSDKP (purity >95%) was generously supplied by IPSEN-Biotech (Paris, France). The radiolabeled N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-[4-3H]Lys-Pro ([3H]AcSDKP), specifically tritiated on the lysyl residue, was prepared as described previously (purity >99% determined by radiochromatography HPLC)(31Sotty D. Lenfant M. Sasaki A.N. Roy J. Morgat J.L. Giralt E. Andreu D. Peptides 1990. ESCOM Science Publishers, Leyden, The Netherlands1991: 309-310Crossref Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity was about 90 Ci/mmol (3247 GBq/mmol).Standard Enzymatic AssaysThe enzymatic assays were performed in triplicate, at 37°C, in 100 mM Tris-maleate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 μM ZnSO4, 50 mM NaCl (buffer A). The kinetics of AcSDKP hydrolysis were determined by incubating enzymes (0.4 nM wild-type ACE, 0.3 nM ACEK959,963, and 9 nM ACEK361,365) with AcSDKP over a concentration range of 0.35-40 μM, added to [3H]AcSDKP (5 μCi). The reaction was stopped by freezing on dry ice, and samples were then analyzed. AcSDKP (4 mM), Lys-Pro (KP) (2 mM) and lysine (1 mM) were added as carriers to the incubation media. To evaluate the radioactivity specifically associated with each peptide or amino acid component, the mixture was submitted to high voltage paper electrophoresis analysis, as described elsewhere(32Offord R.E. Nature. 1966; 211: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), a technique that appeared to be, in this case, as sensitive and accurate as HPLC analysis. Detection was performed with 0.1% ninhydrin in acetone. [3H]AcSDKP and [3H]KP were characterized by their respective migration distance, and the radioactivity associated with each spot was measured using an automatic β scintillation counter. The average recovery of this technique was around 90%. For each substrate concentration, the percentage of AcSDKP hydrolysis (<10%) was then calculated, and the initial velocity of AcSDKP hydrolysis (V0) for the three recombinant enzymes was determined. Potential inhibition of ACE enzymatic activity by the product KP was investigated using Hip-His-Leu as substrate in the assay described above.pH Dependence and Chloride Activation of AcSDKP HydrolysisThe pH dependence of AcSDKP hydrolysis by wild-type ACE and ACE mutants was studied by incubating AcSDKP (100 nM) with wild-type ACE (2.5 nM), ACEK959,963 (0.9 nM), and ACEK361,365 (10 nM). Incubations were carried out at 37°C, in 100 mM Tris-maleate buffer, 10 μM ZnSO4, 50 mM NaCl, over a pH range of 5.0-9.0. Assays were also performed in 100 mM Hepes (pH 6.8-8.0) or potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5-8.0), 10 μM ZnSO4, 50 mM NaCl. The reaction was stopped after a 10-min incubation time as described above.The effect of various chloride concentrations (0-600 mM) on AcSDKP (100 nM) hydrolysis was studied by incubation with wild-type ACE (2 nM), ACEK959,963 (0.6 nM), and ACEK361,365 (26 nM) in 100 mM Tris-maleate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 μM ZnSO4.Inhibition of AcSDKP Hydrolysis by ACE Monoclonal AntibodyMonoclonal antibodies raised against wild-type human ACE are able to discriminate between the two homologous domains of ACE (33Danilov S.M. Jaspard E. Churakova T. Towbin H. Savoie F. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26806-26814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mAb i2H5 (a gift from Dr S. Danilov, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Unit 367, Paris) raised against purified human lung ACE (34Danilov S.M. Allikmets E.Y. Sakharov I.Y. Dukhanina E.A. Trakht I.N. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1987; 9: 319-322PubMed Google Scholar) recognizes epitopes in the N-terminal domain of ACE and inhibits the enzymatic activity of the N-terminal active site only(33Danilov S.M. Jaspard E. Churakova T. Towbin H. Savoie F. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26806-26814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory potency of mAb i2H5 toward wild-type ACE (2 nM), ACEK959,963 (2 nM), and ACEK361,365 (19 nM) was determined by establishing dose-dependent inhibition curves. The three forms of recombinant ACE and varying concentrations of mAb i2H5 (1:1, 5:1, 50:1, and 250:1 molar ratios) were incubated overnight at 4°C before the addition of AcSDKP (5 μM for wild-type ACE and ACEK959,963 and 0.5 μM for ACEK361,365) to determine residual enzyme activity. The reaction was stopped after a 1-h incubation at 37°C. Incubations in the absence of antibody were performed under the same conditions. Control incubations were carried out in the presence of: 1) antibody at the highest concentration, to study possible interactions between the peptide and the antibody, and 2) ACE with a monoclonal antibody (directed against angiotensinogen) at high concentration, to test nonspecific inhibition of ACE activity.Inhibition of AcSDKP and Hip-His-Leu Hydrolysis by Various ACE InhibitorsThe potency of captopril (gift from Bristol Myers Squibb) and lisinopril (gift from Merck Sharp and Dohme) for the inhibition of AcSDKP hydrolysis by recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of ACE was determined by establishing dose-dependent inhibition curves at equilibrium. As tested compounds were competitive slow binding inhibitors of ACE, wild-type ACE (2 nM), ACEK959,963 (2 nM), and ACEK361,365 (20 nM) were preincubated with the different inhibitors for 30 min at 37°C in buffer A, over a range of inhibitor concentrations around the IC50 (concentration of inhibitor needed to produce 50% inhibition). A preincubation of ACE without inhibitor was performed in duplicate under the same conditions. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μM AcSDKP (corresponding to 0.15 × Km) for wild-type ACE and ACEK959,963 and 0.5 μM AcSDKP for ACEK361,365, and reactions were terminated after 1 h. The product [3H]KP was quantified as described above, and IC50 values were determined.In order to compare the effects of these inhibitors on two highly different ACE substrates with regard to the activities of the N- and C-domains of ACE, the inhibition of Hip-His-Leu hydrolysis was also studied. Wild-type ACE (0.01 nM), ACEK361,365 (0.01 nM), and ACEK959,963 (0.1 nM) were preincubated with various concentrations of inhibitors for 30 min at 37°C, in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.3, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 μM ZnSO4. Residual free enzyme activity was determined by the addition of 500 μM Hip-His-Leu, corresponding to 0.25 × Km. Initial velocities were measured during the first 5% of substrate hydrolysis, and under these conditions the IC50 can be considered to correspond to the Ki(15Wei L. Clauser E. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13398-13405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS[3H]AcSDKP was incubated with the recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of ACE, and the radioactivity associated with unhydrolyzed [3H]AcSDKP and with the potential radioactive products [3H]KP and [3H]K was determined. The radioactivity profile indicated that in all cases a unique radiolabeled metabolite was generated, which corresponded to the dipeptide [3H]KP (results not shown). No ACE inhibition by the product Lys-Pro up to concentrations 10 times higher than that generated during maximal AcSDKP hydrolysis was detected using Hip-His-Leu as substrate (results not shown).pH Dependence and Chloride Activation of AcSDKP HydrolysisThe pH dependence of AcSDKP hydrolysis by the three recombinant forms of ACE was studied over a pH range of 5.0-9.0. Although the three enzymes exhibited an optimal activity at the same pH value of 6.5, they displayed different activity profiles over this pH range (Fig. 1): the pH dependence of ACEK361,365 activity was shifted toward a lower pH compared with ACEK959,963 (at pH 8.0, ACEK959,963 and ACEK361,365 activities were 50 and 25% of their optimal activities, respectively). In addition, the pH dependence curve of the wild-type ACE activity exhibited a diphasic profile following, at pH >7.0, the profile curve of ACEK959,963 and, at lower pH, those of both ACEK959,963 and ACEK361,365 (Fig. 1, inset). Similar results were obtained in Hepes buffer with the three recombinant forms of ACE, whereas a complete inhibition of the three recombinant enzymes was observed in phosphate buffer (results not shown).The chloride sensitivity of AcSDKP hydrolysis by the wild-type and the two mutant forms of ACE was then analyzed at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2). The activities of the wild-type enzyme and of ACEK959,963 were optimal at chloride concentrations of around 50 mM and were inhibited at supra-optimal chloride concentrations. An optimal activity of ACEK361,365 was observed at chloride concentrations of around 300 mM, although 70% of optimal activity was observed at 50 mM NaCl (Fig. 2). The apparent activation constants (K′a) for both the wild-type enzyme and ACEK959,963 were 5 mM, whereas that for ACEK361,365 was 29 mM.Figure 2:Chloride dependence of AcSDKP hydrolysis by recombinant forms of ACE. AcSDKP (100 nM) hydrolysis was evaluated at 37°C over the range of NaCl concentrations of 0-600 mM, in 100 mM Tris-maleate, 10 μM ZnSO4, pH 7.0, buffer. AcSDKP was incubated independently with 0.6 nM ACEK959,963 (○), 26 nM ACEK361,365 (×) and 2 nM wild-type ACE (•). The velocity (Vo) of each reaction was determined and the optimal velocity (Vopt) was calculated in each case. The ratio Vo/Vopt was plotted against NaCl concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Kinetic Parameters of AcSDKP HydrolysisThe Km values at 50 mM NaCl calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 3, A and B), by wild-type ACE, ACEK959,963, and ACEK361,365 were 41, 31, and 39 μM, respectively (Table 1). The results are the means of three independent determinations, which varied by 10-30%. A slight difference of the Km values was observed, but the kcat values differ markedly (Table 1). The wild-type ACE and ACEK959,963 exhibit similar kcat values, whereas ACEK361,365 hydrolyzes AcSDKP at a much slower rate. The kcat/Km value obtained for ACEK959,963 is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The same study was carried out in the presence of 300 mM NaCl for ACEK361,365. The Km and kcat/Km values determined remained similar to those determined at 50 mM NaCl and were 10 μM and 0.01 μM-1•s-1, respectively.Figure 3:Lineweaver-Burk plots of AcSDKP hydrolysis by recombinant forms of ACE. Enzyme assays were carried out at 37°C, in 100 mM Tris-maleate, 10 μM ZnSO4, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, buffer in a final volume of 90 μl. Initial rates (Vo) of AcSDKP hydrolysis were calculated from [3H]Lys-Pro dipeptide formed (<10%) for each substrate concentration (S), and the ratio (E)/Vo was plotted against 1/S for (A) ACEK959,963 (○) and wild-type ACE (•) and (B) ACEK361,365 (×). The inset shows a replot on a larger scale of the intersections of the axes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table I Open table in a new tab Inhibition by an ACE Monoclonal AntibodyAs shown in Table 2, the ACE mAb i2H5 was significantly more effective in inhibiting AcSDKP hydrolysis by ACEK959,963 than by ACEK361,365. A 50% inhibition was observed at a mAb i2H5/ACEK959,963 molar ratio of 5:1, and only a 12% inhibition was obtained at a mAb i2H5/ACEK361,365 molar ratio of 250:1. The inhibitory potency of the mAb i2H5 on wild-type ACE activity was close to that observed with ACEK959,963.Table II Open table in a new tab Inhibition of AcSDKP Hydrolysis by ACE Inhibitors and Comparison with Inhibition of Hip-His-Leu HydrolysisThe inhibitory potencies of ACE inhibitors toward AcSDKP hydrolysis by the recombinant enzymes were determined. Captopril and lisinopril appeared to be potent inhibitors of AcSDKP hydrolysis by wild-type ACE and ACEK959,963; IC50 values were about 2 nM, whereas for ACEK361,365 IC50 values were about 30 nM.Since AcSDKP behaved as a specific substrate of the N-active site, it was interesting to compare the inhibitory potency of these ACE inhibitors using Hip-His-Leu as substrate, which is almost exclusively cleaved by the C-active site. The inhibitory potency of captopril was evaluated as 4 nM, 0.4 nM, and 2 nM for wild-type ACE, ACEK959,963, and ACEK361,365, respectively. Ki values obtained for lisinopril were 0.5 nM, 7 nM, and 0.3 nM for wild-type ACE, ACEK959,963, and ACEK361,365, respectively. Captopril was more efficacious toward the N-active site than the C-active site, whereas the reverse was observed for lisinopril.DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence have been reported previously that indicate the involvement of human plasma ACE in the in vitro degradation of the tetrapeptide AcSDKP(26Rieger K.J. Saez-Servent N. Papet M.P. Wdzieczak-Bakala J. Morgat J.L. Thierry J. Voelter W. Lenfant M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), a negative regulator of the hematopoietic stem cell proliferation(16Lenfant M. Wdzieczak-Bakala J. Guittet E. Prome J.C. Sotty D. Frindel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to determine precisely the characteristics of AcSDKP degradation by ACE. Data indicate that recombinant wild-type ACE and the two full-length N-active (ACEK959,963) and C-active (ACEK361,365) mutants of ACE are able to cleave AcSDKP by a dipeptidase activity. However, the N- and C-active sites were differently involved in AcSDKP hydrolysis since they displayed markedly different kinetic parameters and different responses to pH, chloride ions, and ACE inhibitors.The pH dependence profile of AcSDKP hydrolysis was similar for the three different recombinant enzymes with an optimum pH of 6.5. A strong inhibition of all enzyme activities was observed in the presence of PO43- ions, as observed previously for ACE acting on two other synthetic substrates, Hip-Gly-Gly (35Dorer F.E. Kahn J.R. Lentz K.E. Levine M. Skeggs L.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and para-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl glycyltryptophylglycine(36Persson A. Wilson I.B. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) study ruled out an association between PO43- ions and AcSDKP. 3D. Guillaume, unpublished results. The inhibitory effect of phosphate ions on ACE activity is not well understood and has not been observed for the substrates Hip-His-Leu or angiotensin I(28Cushman D.W. Cheung H.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 1637-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 37Ehlers M.R.W. Kirsch R.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 27: 5538-5544Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It may be possible that there is a direct interaction of the monobasic form of phosphate with the peptidic chain of the enzyme resulting in the prevention of the hydrolysis of AcSDKP.The hydrolysis of AcSDKP by the three recombinant forms of ACE occurred slowly in the absence of chloride ions and was activated by chloride addition. In the case of the wild-type recombinant ACE, optimal activity was observed at a 50 mM chloride concentration, and an inhibition was observed at a concentration above 100 mM. In this respect, AcSDKP, which possesses a lysyl residue at the penultimate position, is analogous to the classical ACE class II substrates (38Shapiro R. Holmquist B. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and can be considered as one of those substrates with a chloride activation constant value of K′a = 5 mM. Similar characteristics were also found for ACEK959,963. Conversely, ACEK361,365 hydrolyzes AcSDKP optimally at chloride concentrations above 300 mM, and is characterized by an activation constant of K′a = 29 mM which classifies AcSDKP as an ACE class III substrate for the C-active site of ACE. A difference in the chloride sensitivity of the two active sites of ACE has already been reported for angiotensin I hydrolysis by the same recombinant enzymes(14Jaspard E. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J.

This may suggest that associated proteins, rather than the intracellular domain of either TNF receptor, act as essential elements in signal transmission. Such accessory molecules may be cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, exemplified by JAK2, which interacts with the erythropoietin and other receptors(26Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), or non-tyrosine kinases, such as gp130, which associates with the interleukin-6 and other receptors(27Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Consistent with the hypothesis that TRAPS may be important to TNF action are recent reports describing co-precipitation of TNFR-1 with a protein kinase activity(28VanArsdale T.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar, 29Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies were initiated to identify proteins that associate with the intracellular domain of TNFR-1 (TNFR-1IC) and might then initiate signal transduction. To address this problem, we used the yeast-based two hybrid system, a method for studying protein-protein interactions(30Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar, 31Chien C.-T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). This method is based on the properties of the yeast GAL4 protein, which consists of separable domains that mediate DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Plasmids encoding two hybrid proteins, one consisting of the GAL4 binding domain (GAL4-BD) fused to protein X and the other consisting of the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4-AD) fused to protein Y, are cotransformed into yeast. Interaction between these proteins permits transcriptional activation of an integrated copy of the GAL4-lacZ reporter gene. To identify proteins that interact with TNFR-1IC, a plasmid in which TNFR-1IC was fused with GAL4-BD (pGBT-TNFR1IC) was cotransformed into yeast together with a pool of plasmids encoding GAL4-AD/HeLa S3 cDNA library fusion proteins. This has led to identification of a gene encoding a novel protein that binds TNFR-1IC. The protein was precipitated using a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase and TNFR-1IC, demonstrating that it interacts directly with the TNF receptor. The protein shows significant homology to members of the 90-kDa family of heat shock proteins (hsp90) and is widely expressed in normal tissues and transformed cells. We also used the two hybrid system to assay the ability of deletion mutations of TNFR-1IC to interact with the newly discovered protein. These experiments show that the amino acid sequences necessary for interaction are diffusely distributed outside of the cytotoxicity domain in TNFR-1IC. Identification of this TNF receptor-associated protein, which we call TRAP-1, is an important step toward defining how TNFR-1 couples to signal transduction pathways and transduces TNF binding into responses. Yeast strains for two hybrid experiments were obtained from Clontech as components of the Matchmaker Two Hybrid System. Yeast strains SFY526 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu 2-3, 112, canr,gal4-542, gal80-538, URA3::GAL1-lacZ) and HF7c (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4-542, gal80-538, LYS2::GAL1HIS3, URA3::(GAL4 17-mers)3-CYC1-lacZ) were used to assay for protein-protein interactions and for library screening, respectively. SFY526 has the upstream-activating sequence and TATA sequences of the GAL1 promoter fused to the lacZ gene. In HF7c, HIS3 is fused to a GAL1 promoter sequence and LacZ is fused to 3 copies of a 17-mer GAL4 consensus sequence plus the TATA sequence of the CYC1 promoter. The Escherichia coli strain of XL1-blue (Stratagene) was employed in the cloning of plasmids unless otherwise noted. Yeast shuttle vectors pGBT9 (GAL4-BD), pGAD424 (GAL4-AD), pLAM5′ (the lamin gene), pVA3 (the p53 gene), and pTD1 (the SV40 large T antigen gene) were from Clontech. PCR subcloning was used to amplify and insert TNFR-1IC into the unique EcoRI and BamHI of pGBT9 (pGBT-TNFR1IC) using a cDNA clone of TNFR-1 in pUC19 (a gift from Dr. H. Loetscher, Hofmann-LaRoche Inc., Geneva, Switzerland) as the template. The intracellular domains of TNFR-2 (TNFR-2IC) (a gift from Dr. H. Loetscher) and the human FAS antigen (a gift from Dr. S. Nagata, Osaka Bioscience Insitute, Osaka, Japan) (FAS-IC) were amplified and subcloned into pGBT9 as described for TNFR-1IC. PCR products were run on a low melting point gel, cut out, melted, cleaned using a DNA cleanup kit (Promega), digested with appropriate enzymes, and finally ligated to the appropriate vector. Plasmid isolation was accomplished using the Wizard Miniprep and Maxiprep kits from Promega. Six primers were designed to amplify various regions within TNFR-1IC to make a series of deletion mutants. For oriented cloning, the 5′ primers were linked to EcoRI, and the 3′ primers were linked to BamHI. All constructs were sequenced at the fusion sites to confirm in frame fusion of TNFR-1IC and TNFR-1IC deletion mutants with GAL4-BD. The HeLa S3 Matchmaker cDNA library was purchased from Clontech. pGBT9-TNFR1IC was transformed into HF7c using the lithium acetate procedure. After determining that TNFR-1IC alone does not contain any latent transcriptional activity in HF7c, the transformant was grown overnight in Trp- synthetic medium, to ensure that every cell contained pGBT9-TNFR1IC, and sequentially transformed with 500 μg of the HeLa S3 Matchmaker cDNA (prepared in the two hybrid activation vector pGADGH). Double transformed cells on 50 Leu-, Trp-, His- plates were incubated for 5 days at 30°C before positive colonies were picked, restreaked onto triple minus plates, and assayed for the lacZ phenotype. Library clones that activated the lacZ reporter gene only in the presence of pGBT9-TNFR1IC were chosen for sequencing, which was conducted using the Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical). Yeast transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using filter and liquid assays. For filter assays, transformants were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and placed on Whatman No. 1 filter paper that had been soaked in Z buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1.0 mg/ml 5 bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside at 30°C. Color developed between 5 min and 10 h. For the liquid assay, cells were diluted 5-fold in rich media (YPD), grown to mid-log phase (A600, 0.4-0.8), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed at 37°C, and further disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. The procedure of Miller (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) was then used to quantitate β-galactosidase activity; however, chlorophenyl-red-β-D-glactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) was used for color development, and cell pellets were resuspended in 900 μl of 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin. 100 μl of 50 mM chlorophenyl-red-β-D-glactopyranoside was added following cellular disruption, and the amount of liberated chlorophenyl-red-β-D-glactopyranoside was determined by A574. Numbers represent β-galactosidase activity in Miller units and are expressed as the mean of triplicate determinations ± S.D. The 2-kb cDNA insert of clone I-45 from the two hybrid library screen was sequenced, and the restriction sites were mapped. PCR was performed to amplify the sequence missing at the 5′-end of the TRAP-1 gene using 5′-RACE Ready cDNA from human liver (Clontech) as a template. Two TRAP-1 gene-specific primers (GSP1, GSP2) were designed based on the TRAP-1 partial sequence of I-45 that binds near the N terminus of the known sequence. The sequences of the gene-specific primers are 5′-CTTTGTCTCGGCCTGGAAC-3′ (GSP1) and 5′-CGGGATCCCATGTTTGGAAGTGGAACCCT-3′ (GSP2). Primary and secondary PCR was performed according to the protocol provided by Clontech. Using the N terminal 0.6-kb PCR product of the TRAP-1 gene from I-45 as a probe, a HeLa S3 cDNA library in lambda ZAPII (Stratagene) was screened using standard techniques. The longest 2.2-kb insert was rescued as a phagemid (pBluescript-TRAP1) by coinfection with the helper phage. Membranes pre-blotted with poly(A)+ RNA from a variety of human tissues and cancer cell lines were obtained from Clontech. A 0.6-kb N-terminal PCR product of clone I-45 and an 0.8-kb probe to hsp90-β (Stressgen Biotech. Corp.), which were labeled using a Prime-A gene labeling kit from Promega, were used as probes. Hybridization, washing, and stripping of the blots were conducted according to instructions provided by Clontech. Three GST-TNFR1IC fusion constructs were prepared by amplifying and inserting desired portions of TNFR-1IC into the unique EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech. Inc.): 1) full-length TNFR-1IC (amino acids 205-413, GST-TNFR1IC); 2) part of the N-terminal half of TNFR-1IC (amino acids 243-315, GST-TNFR1NH2); and 3) the C-terminal half of TNFR-1IC (amino acids 316-413, GST-TNFR1COOH). After induction, cells were grown at 30°C for 3 h, suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol), and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 30 min), and one-tenth volume of 50% GST-agarose slurry (Sigma) was incubated with the supernatant for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with lysis, buffer and the purity of the GST fusion proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used for one tube transcription/translation according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Rabbit reticulocyte was mixed with 1 μg of pBluscript-TRAP1 and T3 RNA polymerase, after which amino acid mixture without methionine plus [35S]methionine was added to the incubate. After 2 h at 30°C, expression of TRAP-1 was characterized by SDS-PAGE and molecular image analysis (Bio-Rad). In vitro translation yielded a dominant 65-kDa protein, which is the predicted size assuming that the first internal Met codon of the pBluescript-TRAP1 is the start site for most translation. Agarose-bound GST alone (10 μg), GST-TNFR1IC (10 μg), GST-TNFR1NH2 (30 μg), or GST-TNFR1COOH (10 μg) was added to binding buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.7, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and 40 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing [35S]methionine-labeled TRAP-1. After 1 h at 4°C, the agarose beads were washed four times with binding buffer before addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, electrophoresis, and phosphoimage analysis. TNFR-1IC truncations spanning amino acids 205-280, 205-359, 278-359, 278-426, and 352-426 were fused in frame with the GAL4-BD by PCR subcloning. These constructs and I-45 were cotransformed into SFY526, which were assayed for the lacZ phenotype. Expression of the GAL4-BD/TNFR-1IC fusion proteins was determined by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody directed against GAL4-BD (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, yeast transformants were grown overnight in minimal media and then diluted 5-fold in YPD broth. At mid-log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), resuspended in TE buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and lysed by agitation with glass beads. Supernatants were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P, which was hybridized with the GAL4-BD antibody at 1:2000 dilution and detected by ECL (Amersham Corp.). To identify proteins that interact with TNFR-1IC, plasmids encoding TNFR-1IC fused with the GAL4-BD (pGBT-TNFR1IC) and HeLa S3 Matchmaker cDNA were cotransformed into HF7c. Double transformant colonies were screened and selected for histidine prototrophy (Fig. 1a). Colonies isolated as His+ transformants were assayed for lacZ expression to eliminate false positives, an effective procedure as the His3 and lacZ reporter genes in HF7c are under control of dissimilar promoters. Activation domain library plasmids encoding potential TRAPs were isolated from the double positive colonies, and the GAL4-AD/TRAP gene fusion site was sequenced. We found two groups of cDNAs that encode distinct proteins: TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP-1) and a second receptor associated protein (TRAP-2), which will be described elsewhere. Two TRAP-1 clones, I-45 and I-57, were sequenced at the fusion site; both were in frame with GAL4-AD, and I-57 was shorter than I-45 by 9 bases (Fig. 1b). Sequence analysis of the cDNA insert of I-45 showed that the partial TRAP-1 gene spans 1996 bases with an open reading frame ending at base 1827. From the fusion site, this clone encodes a protein of 608 amino acids. Experiments were conducted to establish that interaction of TNFR-1IC with TRAP-1 is specific (Fig. 1c). I-45 by itself was incapable of activating β-galactosidase activity, which shows that TRAP-1 does not contain a latent transcriptional activator. GAL4-BD alone, lamin, TNFR-2IC, or FAS-IC, which contains a cytotoxicity domain with homology to that found in TNFR-1IC, did not interact with TRAP-1. Only when the TNFR-1IC gene was cotransformed with I-45 was activation of the lacZ reporter gene detected. These observations rule out the possibility that TRAP-1 nonspecifically interacts with other proteins. To identify the full-length size and distribution of expression of TRAP-1 RNA, we used a 0.6-kb N-terminal PCR product of I-45 as a probe to hybridize blots of multiple normal tissues and various transformed cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2, there was a single TRAP-1 transcript of about 2.4 kb. To obtain the full-length cDNA for TRAP-1, we used 5′-RACE PCR and also screened a lambda ZAPII cDNA library. The 5′-RACE PCR extended the known sequence of TRAP-1 by 180 bases. The combined sequence of I-45 with the 5′-RACE PCR product spans 2.2 kb (versus 2.4 kb, mRNA size) and is predicted to encode a protein of 661 amino acids (Fig. 3). A highly compressed GC-rich region of about 30 bases at the 5′-end of the PCR product may have prevented the reverse transcriptase from reading to the 5′-end of the message. Similarly, the longest phage clone isolated as a phagemid from the lambda ZAPII library search was 2.2 kb (pBluescript-TRAP1). However, it is most important that the sequence defined by the two hybrid screen and the 5′-RACE PCR encodes virtually the complete coding sequence of TRAP-1 and contains all of the elements necessary for binding to TNFR-1IC.Figure 3:Sequence of TRAP-1 cDNA with predicted amino acid sequence. Clone I-45, which includes the poly(A) tail, and a cDNA segment obtained from 5′-RACE PCR were sequenced. The sequence spans 2156 bases without the poly(A) tail and encodes a protein of 661 amino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify homologous proteins, the predicted amino acid sequence of TRAP-1 was used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base using Blast command. TRAP-1 shares significant homology, 34% sequence identity and overall homology of about 60% when conserved substitutions are included, with members of the hsp90 family (33Moore S.K. Kozak C. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5343-5351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Homologies between hsp90s and TRAP-1 are not restricted to a single sequence of amino acids but reside in at least six distinct domains. A striking difference between hsp90s and TRAP-1 is the absence of a highly charged domain in the latter, which is present in the former. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2, top) showed that TRAP-1 mRNA is variably present in eight different normal tissues and was in eight transformed cell lines. To rule out the possibility that the probe used to define the size and tissue distribution of TRAP-1 mRNA nonspecifically recognizes hsp90, the blots used for the experiments in Fig. 2 were stripped and hybridized with a probe to hsp90 (Fig. 2, bottom). The hsp90 mRNA was distinguished from that of TRAP-1 by size (2.4 compared with 2.7 kb, respectively) and relative expression level in normal tissues and transformed cells. An in vitro binding assay was developed to demonstrate direct interaction between TRAP-1 and TNFR-1IC and to establish that identification of TRAP-1 as a TNF receptor-associated protein was not an artifact of the two hybrid system. TRAP-1 expressed by in vitro translation and labeled with [35S]methionine was incubated with agarose GST, and with GST fusion proteins containing full-length TNFR-1IC (GST-TNFR1IC), the N-terminal half of TNFR-1IC (GST-TNFR1NH2) and the C-terminal half of TNFR-1IC (GST-TNFR1COOH) (Fig. 5). GST-TNFR1IC and GST-TNFR1NH2 precipitated TRAP-1, whereas GST or GST-TNFR1COOH did not. These observations show that TNFR-1IC binds TRAP-1 without the intermediacy of third proteins and does so in a mammalian cell-free system as well as in yeast. Thus, identification of TRAP-1 as a TNF receptor-associated protein cannot be an artifact associated with the use of the two hybrid system. These observations additionally show that the binding site for TRAP-1 resides in the N-terminal half of TNFR-1IC. To further define the amino acid sequences important for interaction of TNFR-1IC with TRAP-1, we constructed C- and N-terminal truncations of TNFR-1IC. The deletion mutants were subcloned into the pGBT9 and cotransformed into SFY526 together with I-45 to assay their interactions using the two hybrid system. The relationship of these mutants to TNFR-1IC and their ability to interact with TRAP-1 and thereby activate β-galactosidase is shown in Fig. 6a. The results obtained do not directly reflect the affinity of the interaction between TNFR-1IC domains with TRAP-1 since expression of the GAL4-BD/TNFR-1IC fusion proteins in yeast, assayed by Western blotting with an antibody directed against the GAL4-BD (Fig. 6b), was somewhat variable. However, the results can be used to determine whether any receptor domain contains recognition elements essential to the interaction between TNFR-1IC and TRAP-1, especially when interpreted together with observations made using GST-TNFR1IC fusion proteins (Fig. 5). Peptides encompassing amino acids 205-280 and 278-359 activated β-galactosidase, showing that the elements that promote interaction of TNFR-1IC with TRAP-1 are diffusely distributed. The avidity with which amino acids 205-359 bound TRAP-1 (123 Miller units of β-galactosidase activity) was more than predicted based on an additive response to amino acids 205-280 and 278-359 (45 Miller units), suggesting that the conformation of the peptide and perhaps the accessibility of crucial binding domains plays a role in regulating interaction. The inability of residues 352-426 to produce β-galactosidase activity shows that the binding sites reside largely, if not entirely, outside of the cytotoxicity domain, a result consistent with the ability of GST-TNFR1NH2 but not GST-TNFR1COOH to precipitate TRAP-1 (Fig. 5). A larger C-terminal peptide (amino acids 278-426) was also unable to activate β-galactosidase, despite the capacity of the peptide encompassing residues 278-359 to do so. One explanation for this result is that th"

We have previously shown that both tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-1 and mono-phosphopeptides containing a single YXXM motif activate PI 3′-kinase in vitro. However, activation by the mono-phosphopeptides was significantly less potent than activation by the multiply phosphorylated IRS-1.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we produced recombinant PI 3′-kinase containing either wild-type p85 or p85 mutated in its N-terminal, C-terminal, or both SH2 domains. We find that mutation of either SH2 domains significantly reduced phosphopeptide binding and decreased PI 3′-kinase activation by 50%, whereas mutation of both SH2 domains completely blocked binding and activation.

This cooperative action of laccase and VAO also prevented the polymerization of phenolic compounds and reduced the molecular weight of soluble lignosulfonates to a significant extent. INTRODUCTIONThe biological mechanism of lignin degradation has been extensively studied because of the heterogeneous polymeric structure of phenylpropane subunits recalcitrant to normal hydrolytic treatments and because of the complexity of the enzymatic systems involved. It has been proposed that two classes of extracellular enzymes, phenol oxidases (laccases) and lignin peroxidases, isolated from the culture media of different ligninolytic fungi, participate in the mechanism of ligninolysis through their ability to catalyze the cleavage of carbon-carbon and/or carbon-oxygen bonds in lignin model compounds in vitro. Lignin peroxidases catalyze the oxidation of various aromatic substrates to produce aryl cation radicals, whereas laccases oxidize phenolic substrates to phenoxy radicals. These radicals spontaneously rearrange themselves, leading to the fission of carbon-carbon or carbon-oxygen bonds of the alkyl side chains or to the cleavage of aromatic rings. Nevertheless, experiments aimed at reproducing natural biodegradation in vitro showed that these two biocatalysts are able to depolymerize high molecular weight lignins but that low molecular weight products accumulated simultaneously recondense(1Leonowicz A. Sklarz G. Wojtas-Wasilewska M. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 393-396Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Hammel K.E. Jensen K.A. Mozuch M.D. Landucci L.L. Tien M. Pease E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12274-12281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This side effect could be avoided in vivo by mere cell uptake or reducing processes that switch off the reactivity of the small molecules formed. It has been suggested that the latter of the functions mentioned could be carried out by some FAD-dependent oxidases able to reduce quinonoids or radical compounds. In fact, the synergistic effect of laccase and glucose oxidase was proposed by Green (3Green T.R. Nature. 1977; 268: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in Polyporus versicolor and confirmed by Sklarz and Leonowicz (4Sklarz G. Leonowicz A. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 2537-2539Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using lignosulfonates as the substrates; a similar effect was also present in Rigidoporus lignosus(5Galliano H. Gas G. Seris J.L. Boudet A.M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1991; 13: 478-482Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another FAD oxidase, cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase from Phanerochaete chrisosporium, is thought to be involved in preventing the repolymerization in lignin degradation, but its role is still debated (6Odier E. Mozuch M.D. Kalyanaraman B. Kirk T.K. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Samejima M. Eriksson K.E.L. Eur. J.

These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of aryl α- and α-β-unsaturated γ-alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes with concomitant reduction of O2 to H2O2. In all of the species examined, these enzymes have been identified in the culture broth in the later stage of growth when secondary metabolic pathways are presumably switched on by starvation. The metabolic role proposed for these enzymes has been that of providing H2O2 to be used by peroxidases, which have been assumed to be principally responsible for lignin degradation. In Pleurotus ostreatus, at least three different phenol oxidases and an extracellular aryl alcohol oxidase, namely a veratryl alcohol oxidase (VAO), 1The abbreviations used are: VAOveratryl alcohol oxidaseBSAbovine serum albuminDCIP2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenolEPRelectron paramagnetic resonance. have been characterized(8Sannia G.

Nitti G. Cannio R. Sannia G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 39: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The only glucose oxidase purified and characterized was found intracellularly(15Shin K.-S. Youn H.-D. Han Y.-H. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and no cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase nor any lignin peroxidase activity have so far been detected. To study the role of VAO in prevention of polymerization of phenolic compounds and in lignin degradation, its activity was assayed on laccase-treated soluble lignins, and its specificity on both synthetic and laccase-generated quinonoid species was examined.DISCUSSIONLaccase oxidative reactions on monomeric and polymeric phenol compounds proceed first through the formation of very unstable radical intermediates, which can undergo rapid association and hence polymerization. To reproduce lignin depolymerization in vitro using only one oxidative enzyme is therefore a limited approach. The systems so far assessed have shown that lignin depolymerization requires the action of more than one enzyme and, in some cases, the contribution of mediator molecules(17Harvey P.J. Schoemacher H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The quenching of the reactive intermediates produced in the reactions catalyzed by both laccases and ligninases, i.e. the prevention of their recondensation, is indeed a necessary step in directing the overall process toward efficient depolymerization. The present work was aimed at verifying whether VAO from P. ostreatus was able, like other FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, to reduce quinonoids or radical compounds and to ascertain its involvement in lignin biodegradation per se or coupled with the oxidative activity of laccase excreted by the same fungus P. ostreatus.The spectrophotometric assays performed clearly revealed that VAO efficiently reduces both synthetic DCIP and guaiacyl quinonoids generated by laccase. In all experiments, the efficiency of the coupled enzyme system was found to be dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen, since the laccase activity is blocked by O2 depletion, and the presence of O2 interferes with the quinonoid reducing activity of VAO.Phenoxy radicals produced by laccase can be reduced by the action of VAO/veratryl alcohol as demonstrated using laccase-generated acetosyringone radical as a model system in the EPR experiments described. These experiments clearly indicate that the overall oxidoreductive process can be summarized in a simple scheme. An illustrative example is drawn in Fig. 5, where the schematic flow diagram shows that laccase-oxidized lignol-like molecules, such as DCIP, can be channeled by the VAO/veratryl alcohol system through a cycle that prevents the polymerization route.The efficiency of the VAO/veratryl alcohol system in the prevention of polymerization was analyzed comparing the retention profiles of gel filtration chromatography of the species formed in the laccase-catalyzed reaction using ferulic acid as substrate. The reducing activity of VAO was able to completely reverse the ferulic acid oxidation by laccase in the early stage of the reaction and consequently to prevent the precipitation of multimerization products. This effect was probably due not only to limited association but also to an increased solubility of the oligomers blocked in reduced phenolic forms by VAO.The radical/quinonoid reduction and the consequent “freezing” of species of low degree of polymerization are responsible also for the depolymerization of lignosulfonates when the VAO/veratryl alcohol system acts in cooperation with laccase. The results of chromatographic analysis of the reaction products indicate that VAO plays an important role in in vitro biodegradation of lignin models but only when strictly associated with an oxidative enzyme, such as laccase, able to promote the process of breakdown on the complex polymeric matrix. A similar and until now unclear role can hence be proposed also for the in vivo function of this enzyme. In fact, VAO shows a broad range of substrate specificity (8Sannia G. Limongi P. Cocca E. Buonocore F. Nitti G. Giardina P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) toward alcohols that can be, like the radical and/or quinonoid cosubstrates, excised from lignin or endogenously synthesized by the fungus itself. Veratryl alcohol is just a representative substrate that has been shown to be released in culture media by another basidiomycete, P. chrisosporium, as a product of a synthetic pathway starting from glucose(18Lundquist K.

Nevertheless, this molecule seems to play a different and not unique role in these kinds of ligninase-expressing basidiomycetes since it serves as a radical mediator in the ligninase-catalyzed oxidation (17Harvey P.J.

A recent analysis has revealed the presence of p-anysil alcohol, a compound similar to veratryl alcohol for VAO substrate specificity(8Sannia G. Limongi P. Cocca E. Buonocore F. Nitti G. Giardina P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), as one of the most representative aromatic alcohols in the culture broth of Pleurotus spp., including P. ostreatus(25Gutierrez A. Caramelo L. Prieto A. Martinez M.J. Martinez A.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the recycling of the aryl aldehydes to aryl alcohols could be ensured by the NADPH-dependent aryl aldehyde dehydrogenases recently found intracellularly in a different Pleurotus sp., namely Pleurotus eryngii(26Guillen F. Evans C.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although, at the moment, no experimental evidence has been reported on the existence of transport systems of VAO-oxidized substrates. It is worth noting that genetic and enzyme analyses revealed no gene/protein of the ligninase family in P. ostreatus(8Sannia G. Limongi P. Cocca E. Buonocore F. Nitti G. Giardina P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Kimura Y. Asada Y. Kuwahara M. Appl. Microbiol.

Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating the possibility of lignin-degradative pathways in which ligninases are not involved. The aryl alcohols would then be provided by the fungus to VAO to explicate an “ancillary” support for the early degrading action of laccases or analogous oxidative enzymes. INTRODUCTIONThe biological mechanism of lignin degradation has been extensively studied because of the heterogeneous polymeric structure of phenylpropane subunits recalcitrant to normal hydrolytic treatments and because of the complexity of the enzymatic systems involved. It has been proposed that two classes of extracellular enzymes, phenol oxidases (laccases) and lignin peroxidases, isolated from the culture media of different ligninolytic fungi, participate in the mechanism of ligninolysis through their ability to catalyze the cleavage of carbon-carbon and/or carbon-oxygen bonds in lignin model compounds in vitro. Lignin peroxidases catalyze the oxidation of various aromatic substrates to produce aryl cation radicals, whereas laccases oxidize phenolic substrates to phenoxy radicals. These radicals spontaneously rearrange themselves, leading to the fission of carbon-carbon or carbon-oxygen bonds of the alkyl side chains or to the cleavage of aromatic rings. Nevertheless, experiments aimed at reproducing natural biodegradation in vitro showed that these two biocatalysts are able to depolymerize high molecular weight lignins but that low molecular weight products accumulated simultaneously recondense(1Leonowicz A. Sklarz G. Wojtas-Wasilewska M. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 393-396Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Hammel K.E. Jensen K.A. Mozuch M.D. Landucci L.L. Tien M. Pease E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12274-12281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This side effect could be avoided in vivo by mere cell uptake or reducing processes that switch off the reactivity of the small molecules formed. It has been suggested that the latter of the functions mentioned could be carried out by some FAD-dependent oxidases able to reduce quinonoids or radical compounds. In fact, the synergistic effect of laccase and glucose oxidase was proposed by Green (3Green T.R. Nature. 1977; 268: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in Polyporus versicolor and confirmed by Sklarz and Leonowicz (4Sklarz G. Leonowicz A. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 2537-2539Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using lignosulfonates as the substrates; a similar effect was also present in Rigidoporus lignosus(5Galliano H. Gas G. Seris J.L. Boudet A.M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1991; 13: 478-482Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another FAD oxidase, cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase from Phanerochaete chrisosporium, is thought to be involved in preventing the repolymerization in lignin degradation, but its role is still debated (6Odier E.

These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of aryl α- and α-β-unsaturated γ-alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes with concomitant reduction of O2 to H2O2. In all of the species examined, these enzymes have been identified in the culture broth in the later stage of growth when secondary metabolic pathways are presumably switched on by starvation. The metabolic role proposed for these enzymes has been that of providing H2O2 to be used by peroxidases, which have been assumed to be principally responsible for lignin degradation. In Pleurotus ostreatus, at least three different phenol oxidases and an extracellular aryl alcohol oxidase, namely a veratryl alcohol oxidase (VAO), 1The abbreviations used are: VAOveratryl alcohol oxidaseBSAbovine serum albuminDCIP2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenolEPRelectron paramagnetic resonance. have been characterized(8Sannia G.

To study the role of VAO in prevention of polymerization of phenolic compounds and in lignin degradation, its activity was assayed on laccase-treated soluble lignins, and its specificity on both synthetic and laccase-generated quinonoid species was examined.

DISCUSSIONLaccase oxidative reactions on monomeric and polymeric phenol compounds proceed first through the formation of very unstable radical intermediates, which can undergo rapid association and hence polymerization. To reproduce lignin depolymerization in vitro using only one oxidative enzyme is therefore a limited approach. The systems so far assessed have shown that lignin depolymerization requires the action of more than one enzyme and, in some cases, the contribution of mediator molecules(17Harvey P.J. Schoemacher H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The quenching of the reactive intermediates produced in the reactions catalyzed by both laccases and ligninases, i.e. the prevention of their recondensation, is indeed a necessary step in directing the overall process toward efficient depolymerization. The present work was aimed at verifying whether VAO from P. ostreatus was able, like other FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, to reduce quinonoids or radical compounds and to ascertain its involvement in lignin biodegradation per se or coupled with the oxidative activity of laccase excreted by the same fungus P. ostreatus.The spectrophotometric assays performed clearly revealed that VAO efficiently reduces both synthetic DCIP and guaiacyl quinonoids generated by laccase. In all experiments, the efficiency of the coupled enzyme system was found to be dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen, since the laccase activity is blocked by O2 depletion, and the presence of O2 interferes with the quinonoid reducing activity of VAO.Phenoxy radicals produced by laccase can be reduced by the action of VAO/veratryl alcohol as demonstrated using laccase-generated acetosyringone radical as a model system in the EPR experiments described. These experiments clearly indicate that the overall oxidoreductive process can be summarized in a simple scheme. An illustrative example is drawn in Fig. 5, where the schematic flow diagram shows that laccase-oxidized lignol-like molecules, such as DCIP, can be channeled by the VAO/veratryl alcohol system through a cycle that prevents the polymerization route.The efficiency of the VAO/veratryl alcohol system in the prevention of polymerization was analyzed comparing the retention profiles of gel filtration chromatography of the species formed in the laccase-catalyzed reaction using ferulic acid as substrate. The reducing activity of VAO was able to completely reverse the ferulic acid oxidation by laccase in the early stage of the reaction and consequently to prevent the precipitation of multimerization products. This effect was probably due not only to limited association but also to an increased solubility of the oligomers blocked in reduced phenolic forms by VAO.The radical/quinonoid reduction and the consequent “freezing” of species of low degree of polymerization are responsible also for the depolymerization of lignosulfonates when the VAO/veratryl alcohol system acts in cooperation with laccase. The results of chromatographic analysis of the reaction products indicate that VAO plays an important role in in vitro biodegradation of lignin models but only when strictly associated with an oxidative enzyme, such as laccase, able to promote the process of breakdown on the complex polymeric matrix. A similar and until now unclear role can hence be proposed also for the in vivo function of this enzyme. In fact, VAO shows a broad range of substrate specificity (8Sannia G. Limongi P. Cocca E. Buonocore F. Nitti G. Giardina P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) toward alcohols that can be, like the radical and/or quinonoid cosubstrates, excised from lignin or endogenously synthesized by the fungus itself. Veratryl alcohol is just a representative substrate that has been shown to be released in culture media by another basidiomycete, P. chrisosporium, as a product of a synthetic pathway starting from glucose(18Lundquist K.

Nevertheless, this molecule seems to play a different and not unique role in these kinds of ligninase-expressing basidiomycetes since it serves as a radical mediator in the ligninase-catalyzed oxidation (17Harvey P.J.

This work reports the cloning and expression of a liver cDNA encoding a microsomal retinol dehydrogenase (RoDH), which catalyzes the primary and rate-limiting step in retinoic acid synthesis. The predicted amino acid sequence and biochemical data obtained from the recombinant enzyme verify it as a short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase. Like microsomal RoDH, the recombinant enzyme recognized as substrate retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein, had higher activity with NADP rather than NAD, was stimulated by ethanol or phosphatidylcholine, was not inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole, was inhibited by phenylarsine oxide and carbenoxolone and localized to microsomes. RoDH recognized the physiological form of retinol, holocellular retinol-binding protein, with a Km of 0.9 μM, a value lower than the ~5 μM concentration of holocellular retinol binding protein in liver. Northern and Western blot analyses revealed RoDH expression only in rat liver, despite enzymatic activity in liver, brain, kidney, lung, and testes. These data suggest that tissue-specific isozyme(s) of short chain alcohol dehydrogenases catalyze the first step in retinoic acid biogenesis and further strengthen the evidence that the “cassette” of retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein serves as a physiological substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2002196437,"We showed previously that the alternative splicing of chondroitin sulfate attachment domains (CS α and CS β) yielded multiforms of the PG-M core protein in mouse. A transcript encoding a new short form of the core protein PG-M(V3) was found in various mouse tissues using polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequences of the polymerase chain reaction products suggested that PG-M(V3) had no chondroitin sulfate attachment domain. PG-M(V3) was also detected in various human tissues. The presence of a transcript for PG-M(V3) was further supported by Northern blot analysis. Southern blot analysis confirmed that multiforms of the PG-M core protein, including PG-M(V3), were derived from a single genomic locus by an alternative splicing mechanism. Because PG-M(V3) has no chondroitin sulfate attachment region, which is the most distinctive portion of a proteoglycan molecule, this form may have a unique function."

In this paper we report the molecular characterization and expression of a novel murine homeobox sequence, Hesx1, isolated from pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Hesx1 is expressed as two transcripts of 1.0 and 1.2 kilobases which encode an identical 185 amino acid open reading frame. The transcripts differ in the 3′-untranslated region due to the differential utilization of a weak splice donor site located immediately downstream of the translation termination codon. The Hesx1 homeodomain shared 80% identity with the Xenopus homeoprotein XANF-1 and was less than 50% related to other homeodomain sequences. Hesx1 and XANF-1 therefore constitute the founder members of a new homeodomain class. Hesx1 expression was down-regulated during embryonic stem cell differentiation and was detected in tissue-specific RNA samples derived from the embryonic liver, and at lower levels in viscera, amnion, and yolk sac. Expression in adult mice was not detected. These sites of expression are consistent with a role for Hesx1 in the regulation of developmental decisions in the early mouse embryo and during fetal hematopoiesis.

By comparing the type I signal peptidase, SipS, of Bacillus subtilis with signal peptidases from prokaryotes, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticular membrane, patterns of conserved amino acids were discovered. The conserved residues of SipS were altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Replacement of methionine 44 by alanine yielded an enzyme with increased activity. Two residues (aspartic acid 146 and arginine 84) appeared to be conformational determinants; three other residues (serine 43, lysine 83, and aspartic acid 153) were critical for activity. Comparison of SipS with other proteases requiring serine, lysine, or aspartic acid residues in catalysis revealed sequence similarity between the region of SipS around serine 43 and lysine 83 and the active-site region of LexA-like proteases. Furthermore, self-cleavage sites of LexA-like proteases closely resembled signal peptidase cleavage sites. Together with the finding that serine and lysine residues are critical for activity of the signal peptidase of Escherichia coli (Tschantz, W. R., Sung, M., Delgado-Partin, V. M., and Dalbey, R. E.

The signal peptide is required for protein targeting to the membrane and initiation of protein translocation across the membrane (1Dobberstein B.

Although the primary structure of signal peptides is poorly conserved, three domains can be distinguished in all of them: first, a short amino-terminal domain with at least one positively charged amino acid; second, a central hydrophobic domain (h-region) of 7-15 amino acids; and third, a polar carboxyl-terminal domain (c-region) of 3 to 7 amino acids(3von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Structurally related signal peptides are required for protein transport to the mitochondrial intermembrane space(5von Heijne G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). During translocation of the protein across the membrane, the signal peptide is removed (processing) by signal peptidases (SPases; (6Dev I.K. Ray P.H. J. Bioenerg.

The prokaryotic SPases, which recognize typical signal peptides as described above, are known as type I SPases, or leader peptidases (Lep). These membrane proteins process the majority of exported bacterial pre-proteins(10Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12073-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dalbey R.E. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15925-15931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three type I SPases of Gram-negative bacteria have been characterized. These are Lep (EC) of Escherichia coli(10Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12073-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Lep (ST) of Salmonella typhimurium(12Van Dijl J.M. van den Bergh R. Reversma T. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1990; 223: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and Lep (PF) of Pseudomonas fluorescens(13Black M.T. Munn J.G.R. Allsop A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Lep (ST) and Lep (PF) show a high degree of sequence identity with Lep (EC) (93 and 50%, respectively) over almost their entire length. As demonstrated for Lep (EC), these three proteins possess two amino-terminal membrane anchors, and both their amino- and carboxyl-terminal moieties are exposed to the periplasm(14Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified SipS of Bacillus subtilis, which is the first characterized type I SPase of a Gram-positive bacterium(15Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although SipS shows some sequence similarity with Lep (EC/ST/PF), it is structurally quite distinct from the latter enzymes(15Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Smith H. Venema G. Bron S. Balla E. Berencsi Gy. Farkas J. Szentirmai A. DNA Transfer and Gene Expression in Microorganisms. Intercept Ltd., Andover, UK1993: 251-262Google Scholar). First, SipS (184 residues) is much smaller than Lep (EC/ST/PF) (323, 324, and 284 residues, respectively). Second, three regions of Lep (EC/ST/PF) are absent from SipS. One of the missing regions corresponds to the first membrane anchor of Lep (EC/ST/PF). Unexpectedly, SipS showed a much higher degree of similarity with a subunit (Imp1p) of the mitochondrial inner membrane protease I (ImpI) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(17Behrens M. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which processes proteins targeted to the inter-membrane space. Like SipS, Imp1p has only one membrane anchor, and both proteins share similarities over almost their entire length (27% identity; (15Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The alignment of SipS, Lep (EC/ST), and Imp1p revealed patterns of conserved amino acids in five distinct regions (denoted A-E) of each enzyme (Fig. 1). These patterns were also detectable in the Imp2p subunit of ImpI(18Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 19Schneider A. Oppliger W. Jenö P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8635-8638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Sec11 subunit of the ER SPase complex (SPC) of S. cerevisiae(20Böhni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the two subunits Spc18 and Spc21 of the canine ER SPC(21Greenburg G. Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15762-15765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, with the sequence of SipS, we could demonstrate structural similarities between prokaryotic and eukaryotic SPases, indicating that these proteins belong to one class of enzymes(15Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated which residues are required for SipS to be functional. We concentrated on those residues that are conserved in all type I SPases because we anticipated that these would be the most important. The residues of region A (Fig. 1) were not analyzed because they reside in the membrane anchor of SipS. This part of the protein is probably not required for the catalytic reaction, because a truncated soluble form of Lep (EC), lacking both anchors, is still capable of correct signal peptide cleavage(23Kuo D.W.

Table 1 lists the plasmids and bacterial strains used. TY medium (tryptone/yeast extract) contained Bacto-tryptone (1%), Bacto-yeast extract (0.5%), and NaCl (1%). M9 medium-1 and −2 used in the labeling of E. coli were prepared as described in (24Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both M9 media were supplemented with ampicillin (40 μg/ml).Table I Open table in a new tab Procedures for DNA purification, restriction, ligation, and agarose gel electrophoresis were carried out as described in (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Enzymes were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). E. coli MC1061 was electrotransformed with ligation mixtures, using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser™. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out with the Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). For site-directed mutagenesis of SipS residues in region B, the following protocol was used. Chromosomal template DNA of B. subtilis was denatured for 1 min at 94°C. Next, two primers (primer M and primer B; Table 2 were used to amplify DNA fragments in 20 cycles of denaturation (30 s; 94°C), primer annealing (1 min; 50°C), and DNA synthesis (1.5 min; 73°C). In addition to the desired mutations, primer M specified a SalI site. Primer B specified either a BclI or an EcoRI site (Table 2). Amplified fragments were purified with the Qiagen PCR purification spin kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), digested overnight with appropriate restriction enzymes, and ligated to linearized plasmid DNA (pMO). When a mutation was to be introduced in the middle part of a DNA fragment (e.g. mutations in regions C, D, and E of SipS), two subsequent PCR reactions were performed. A first PCR with a mutagenic primer (primer M; Table 2) and limiting amounts of a primer specifying one end point of the desired fragment (primer B; Table 2) was performed as described above. Next, about 0.2 μg of the amplified fragment from the first PCR was used as a primer in the second PCR step together with a third primer (primer A; Table 2) specifying the other end point of the desired fragment. This second PCR was carried out under the same conditions as the first PCR. The sequences of all DNA fragments obtained through PCR were verified by the dideoxy-chain termination method(26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar), using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). 35S-dATP was from Amersham (Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, UK). DNA and protein sequences were analyzed using version 6.7 of the PCGene Analysis Program (Intelligenetics Inc., Mountain View, CA). The FASTA algorithm (27Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar) was used for protein comparisons in the Swiss Protein Data base (release 18), the Atlas of protein and genomic sequences (release September 1993; MIPS, Martinsried, FRG), and the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Bank. The RDF2 program was used to evaluate sequence similarities(28Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). To calculate z values, the KTUP value was set to 2, and 500 random shuffles of the test sequences were performed. Alignments with z values greater than 6 were considered significant; alignments with z values smaller than 3 were considered insignificant.Table II Open table in a new tab Pulse-chase labeling, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE were performed as described in Refs. 15, 24, and 29. 14C-Methylated molecular weight markers were from Amersham International. Fluorography was performed as described in (30Skinner M.K. Griswold M.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Relative amounts of precursor and mature forms of (A13i)-β-lactamase were estimated by film scanning with an LKB ultroscan XL laser densitometer. The activities of SipS mutants were compared with that of wild-type SipS by comparing the relative amounts of mature (A13i)-β-lactamase obtained after a chase period of 10 min or 3 h in the presence of the wild-type or the mutant enzyme. A SipS-based peptide (sippep 1) with the sequence NKKRAKQD (residues 115-122 of SipS) was synthesized by Eurosequence B.V. (Groningen, The Netherlands). Sippep 1 contained an amino-terminal S-acetylmercaptoacetyl group to facilitate its cross-linking to ImjectR maleimide-activated bovine serum albumin from Pierce(31Drijfhout J.W. Bloemhoff W. Poolman J.T. Hoogerhout P. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Rabbits were used to raise antibodies against the peptide-bovine serum albumin conjugate at the Finnish National Public Health Institute (KTH; Helsinki). The presence of SipS in E. coli C600 and B. subtilis 8G5 sipS was assayed by Western blotting(32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44912) Google Scholar). Lysates of E. coli C600 were prepared by concentrating cells from overnight cultures 7-fold in loading buffer for SDS-PAGE and subsequent boiling (5 min). Membranes of B. subtilis 8G5 sipS were prepared from cultures in TY medium(33Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were solubilized in 2% Triton X-100 (30 min, 0°C). Nonsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation (135,000 × g; 20 min; 4°C). After SDS-PAGE, proteins of E. coli C600 or solubilized membrane proteins of B. subtilis 8G5 sipS were transferred to Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Bands corresponding to SipS were visualized with antibodies against sippep 1 and alkaline phosphatase-anti-rabbit-IgG conjugates (Western-light™, Tropix, Bedford, MA). SPase cleavage sites were predicted according to the algorithms of von Heijne(34von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The same algorithms were used in a computer program, enabling the search for SPase cleavage sites with a variable window. Sequences of 15 amino acids (residues −13 to +2) that yield a “von Heijne score” higher than 3.5 strongly resemble SPase cleavage sites. For shorter sequences (e.g. −5 to +2) von Heijne scores greater than 0 indicate a strong resemblance with regions surrounding SPase cleavage sites. To map functionally important conserved residues of SipS, a site-directed mutagenesis approach was used. Residues of SipS, which are conserved in all type I SPases, were replaced by alanine. Alanine was chosen because it is small, and it has a chemically inert side chain. Thus, conformational strain and indirect effects on catalysis were minimized. Mutations were introduced in the 3′ part of sipS (encoding residues 41-184) by PCR, using the oligonucleotides shown in Table 2. These were designed in such a way that amplified fragments contained a SalI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI or a BclI site at the 3′ end (Table 2). After restriction with SalI and EcoRI, or SalI and BclI, the fragments were ligated to plasmid pMO (Fig. 2), which was cut with the same restriction enzymes. Since pMO contains the 5′ end of the sipS gene (encoding the residues 1-40), this resulted in a complete copy of a mutant sipS gene. Another advantage of pMO was that it encodes the hybrid precursor pre(A13i)-β-lactamase, which is processed by SipS but not by Lep (EC)(15Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, pre(A13i)-β-lactamase could be used directly to monitor the activity of SipS mutants. To this purpose, E. coli C600 cells containing mutant sipS genes (encoded by pMO derivatives) were labeled for 1 min with [35S]methionine and, subsequently, chased with an excess of nonradioactive methionine for 10 min. With wild-type SipS (E. coli C600 (pGDL41)), this resulted in approximately equal amounts of precursor and mature forms of labeled (A13i)-β-lactamase (Fig. 3, lane +). From a total of 30 SipS mutants in which a conserved residue had been changed to alanine, 11 showed approximately wild-type activity (Fig. 3; T47A, R68A, V72A, V79A, G87A, L88A, P89A, G90A, D91A, Y141A, and N150A). Six SipS mutants showed a slightly reduced activity, ranging between 57 and 90% of the wild-type activity (Fig. 3; P46A, G69A, D70A, I71A, I86A, and S154A). Six other mutants (L48A, L74A, Y81A, N147A, S151A, and R155A) had a more strongly reduced activity ranging between 5 and 39% of the wild-type activity (Fig. 3; L74A and R155A; for other mutants, see Fig. 4). Finally, six mutants (S43A, K83A, R84A, G145A, D146A, and D153A) appeared to be inactive (not shown in Fig. 3; see Fig. 4). To verify the (in-)activity of SipS mutants of the latter two categories (strongly reduced or no activity), pulse-chase labeling experiments were performed in which the chase period was extended to 3 h (Fig. 4). Also in these experiments, the SipS mutants S43A, K83A, and R84A were completely inactive. The mutants D146A and D153A had almost completely lost activity; at the most 3-3.5% of the total (A13i)-β-lactamase synthesized was mature. In contrast, the activities of the mutants L48A, Y81A, G145, N147A, and S151A were clearly manifest after 3 h of chase (Fig. 4). These data indicated that serine 43, lysine 83, arginine 84, aspartic acid 146, and aspartic acid 153 were the most important (conserved) residues for the functionality of SipS.Figure 3:Pre(A13i)-β-lactamase processing by SipS mutants. Processing of pre(A13i)-β-lactamase in E. coli C600 was analyzed by pulse-chase labeling at 37°C and subsequent immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 60 s prior to chase with excess nonradioactive methionine. Samples were withdrawn 10 min after the chase. The SipS mutants analyzed are indicated.

To analyze the role of methionine 44 in more detail, pulse-chase experiments were performed. In the presence of mutant M44A, the half-life of pre(A13i)-β-lactamase was approximately 3 min, as compared with 10 min in the presence of wild-type SipS (not shown). This observation indicated that methionine 44 is important for the level of SipS activity. To evaluate the importance of the residues of SipS that could not be replaced by alanine without a severe loss of activity, these residues were also replaced by other, if possible, more related residues. Thus, serine 43 was replaced by cysteine, threonine, and valine. Interestingly, serine 43 could be replaced by cysteine and threonine without complete loss of activity. Nevertheless, the activity of the mutants S43C and S43T was highly reduced compared with that of the wild type (Fig. 4); only 15 and 34%, respectively, of all (A13i)-β-lactamase synthesized was processed after 3 h of chase. The mutant S43V showed no activity at all (Fig. 4). Thus, serine 43 appeared to be essential for optimal activity of SipS. To assess the possible role of lysine 83 and arginine 84, these residues were replaced by histidine. In addition, lysine 83 was replaced by arginine and arginine 84 by lysine. Also, a double mutant K83R,R84K was constructed. Lysine 83 appeared to be critical for activity of SipS because it could not be replaced by histidine or arginine without complete loss of activity (Fig. 4). In contrast, the replacement of arginine 84 by lysine (Fig. 3) did not affect the activity of SipS. When arginine 84 was replaced by histidine, the activity of SipS was strongly reduced (Fig. 4); only 10% of all (A13i)-β-lactamase was processed after 3 h of chase. These data indicated that arginine 84 is less important for SipS activity than lysine 83. Finally, the double mutant K83R,R84K was inactive (Fig. 4), which is in line with the observation that lysine 83 could not be replaced by arginine. To investigate the importance of the aspartic acid residues at positions 146 and 153, these residues were also replaced by glutamic acid or asparagine. Aspartic acid 146 could be replaced by glutamic acid without loss of activity (Fig. 3). In contrast, the activity of the mutant D146N was severely reduced (Fig. 4); after 3 h of chase only 8% of all (A13i)-β-lactamase was mature. Changes of aspartic acid 153 to glutamic acid or asparagine resulted in a nearly complete loss of SipS activity (Fig. 4); after 3 h of chase only 1-2% of all (A13i)-β-lactamase was processed in the presence of these mutants, indicating that aspartic acid 153 is very important for SipS to function. Since an increased protease sensitivity might cause the reduced activity of SipS mutants, the presence of several mutant proteins in E. coli C600 was tested by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). To probe further the protease sensitivity of the SipS mutants, they were introduced in B. subtilis, an organism which is known for its high-level production of extracellular proteases(35Pero J. Sloma A. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 939-952Google Scholar). Subsequently, the presence of the mutant proteins in B. subtilis was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). For this purpose, we used the B. subtilis strain 8G5 sipS, which lacks the chromosomal sipS gene. None of the mutations at position 43 (S43A, S43C, S43T, and S43V) affected the stability of SipS in E. coli or in B. subtilis. The same was true for SipS mutants in which lysine 83 or aspartic acid 153 was replaced by other residues (Fig. 5, A and B). Together with the finding that replacement of serine 43, lysine 83, and aspartic acid 153 by other residues (almost) completely abolished the activity of SipS, these data indicated that serine 43, lysine 83, and aspartic acid 153 are critical for SipS to function. Two SipS mutants (D146A and D146N) were unstable in E. coli and B. subtilis (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, the SipS mutant D146E was stable in E. coli (Fig. 5A) but not in B. subtilis (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the SipS mutants R84A and R84H were stable in E. coli (Fig. 5A) and unstable in B. subtilis (Fig. 5B). The only mutant that was unstable in E. coli and stable in B. subtilis was the double mutant K83R,R84K (Fig. 5, A and B). These data suggest that the inactivity of the SipS mutants R84A, R84H, and K83R,R84K and the low activity of the SipS mutants D146A and D146N relate to an altered conformation, rendering these mutant proteins sensitive to protease. Thus, arginine 84 and aspartic acid 146 seem to be important conformational determinants of SipS. Although aspartic acid 91 of SipS could be replaced by alanine without loss of activity (Fig. 3), the importance of this residue was further investigated because the corresponding aspartic acid residue of Lep (EC) (aspartic acid 153; Fig. 1) could not be replaced by alanine without loss of activity(36Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aspartic acid 91 of SipS was replaced with glutamic acid or asparagine. Both mutants D91E and D91N showed wild-type activity (Fig. 3). These observations indicate that aspartic acid 91 is not important for the activity of SipS. Although the residues between the conserved regions A and B of SipS and Lep (EC) are relatively well conserved (15Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the three residues immediately preceding serine 43 of SipS and serine 90 of Lep (EC) are not conserved. Since serine 43 appears to be critical for SipS activity, we investigated whether these three nonconserved residues are important for the functionality of SipS. The role of glycine 41 of SipS was of particular interest since this residue is only conserved in Imp1p and Imp2p. In all other type I SPases a glycine residue resides immediately amino-terminally of the serine residue, corresponding to serine 43 of SipS (Fig. 1). First, aspartic acid 42 of SipS was changed to serine. This had no serious effect on the SipS activity (Fig. 3), indicating that aspartic acid 42 is not critical for function. Subsequently, two double mutants of SipS were constructed in which glycine was placed amino-terminally of serine 43. First, glycine 41 and aspartic acid 42 were swapped. The resulting SipS mutant G41D-D42G was not active (Fig. 4). This was not due to degradation of the protein, because its presence could be demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig. 5, A and B). A second double mutant was constructed in which glycine 41 and aspartic acid 42 were replaced by serine and glycine, respectively (like in Lep (EC)). This SipS mutant (G41S,D42G) was still active. However, its activity was low (Fig. 4); only 15% of all (A13i)-β-lactamase was mature after 3 h of chase. Finally, to determine whether the activity of the SipS mutant G41S,D42G might improve upon the introduction of a proline residue at position 40 (like in Lep (EC); (15Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the triple mutant D40P,G41S,D42G was constructed. This mutant was, however, completely inactive (Fig. 4), which may be due to an altered protein conformation; although the SipS mutant D40P, G41S,D,42G was stable in E. coli (Fig. 5A), it was unstable in B. subtilis (Fig. 5B). These data indicated that the order of the three residues at positions 40, 41, and 42 is important for SipS to function. So far, t"

MAPK activation was found to be protein kinase C-dependent, which was analogous to previous studies of D3 and Raf activation. To further explore the D3 cascade, a series of transient transfections were performed using dominant negative raf and MAPK mutant plasmids which effectively block Ras-induced Raf and MAPK activity, respectively. D3 induced a marked increase in the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene linked to the Egr promoter (egr-CAT). When the dominant negative Raf plasmid was co-transfected, there was no significant reduction in egr-CAT. In contrast, when the dominant negative MAPK plasmid was co-transfected, egr-CAT induction was completely abolished. These results suggest that 1) D3 stimulates MAPK via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway, 2) D3-induced Egr expression can occur via a pathway independent of Rasinduced Raf, and 3) D3 absolutely requires MAPK activity for Egr expression.

INTRODUCTIONBovine testicular hyaluronidase is one of the endotype glycosidases and hydrolyzes the internal bonds of both hyaluronic acid (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HAhyaluronic acidGAGglycosaminoglycanCh4Schondroitin 4-sulfateCh6Schondroitin 6-sulfateDSdermatan sulfateΔDi4S2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-D-gluco-4-enopyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-D-galactosePA2-aminopyridineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyNFUNational formulary unit. and chondroitin sulfates, which have the N-acetylhexosamine linkage attached through the 4-position of the uronic acid(1Meyer K. Boyer P.D. The Enzyme. Academic Press, New York1971: 307-320Google Scholar). The final reaction products consist mainly of tetrasaccharides and hexasaccharides. It is known that the tetra- and hexasaccharides are derived from the transglycosylation reaction carried out by hyaluronidase itself(2Weissmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 216: 783-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Highsmith S. Garvin Jr., J.H. Chipman D.M. J. Biol.

Wiley, Chichester1989: 60-86Google Scholar). In other words, hyaluronidase catalyzed the transglycosylation reaction as well as hydrolysis(2Weissmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 216: 783-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Highsmith S. Garvin Jr., J.H. Chipman D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1956; 219: 653-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).When hexasaccharide derived from hyaluronic acid is digested with testicular hyaluronidase, it is considered that hexasaccharides are cleaved to disaccharides and tetrasaccharides initially, which in turn are converted to octasaccharides. Then these octasaccharides are digested to tetrasaccharides(2Weissmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 216: 783-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Highsmith S. Garvin Jr., J.H. Chipman D.M. J.

The Biology of Hyaluronan. Wiley, Chichester1989: 60-86Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of the transglycosylation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is not yet understood, although several effective techniques for analyzing the oligosaccharide transfers that occur rapidly during hydrolysis and transglycosylation were investigated(6Gorham S.D. Olavesen A.H. Dodgson K.S. Connect. Tissue Res. 1975; 3: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Knudsen P.J. Eriksen P.B. Fenger M. Florentz K. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 187: 373-379Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In order to elucidate the glycosyl transfer mechanism, Kon et al.(8Kon A. Takagaki K. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Kojima K. Kato I. Majima M. Endo M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) recently devised a method of labeling the reducing terminal of oligosaccharides using a fluorogenic reagent, 2-aminopyridine (PA). PA-labeled and unlabeled HA oligosaccharides as a substrate were incubated with testicular hyaluronidase, and the reaction products were analyzed using ion spray mass spectrometry(9Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Izumi J. Saitoh H. Endo M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6503-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using these methods, it was clarified that the hyaluronidase was found to hydrolyze the N-acetylhexosaminide linkage at the nonreducing terminal site, and the disaccharide units, glucuronosyl-β1-3-N-acetylglucosamine, were successively released from the nonreducing terminal site. Immediately, the released disaccharide units were quickly transferred to the glucuronic acid residue at the nonreducing terminal of another oligosaccharide chain as an acceptor through the β1-4 linkage. When heptasaccharides or larger oligosaccharides having N-acetylhexosamine at the nonreducing terminal were used as a donor, a trisaccharide, N-acetylglucosaminyl-β1-4 glucuronosyl-β1-3-N-acetylglucosamine was released from the nonreducing terminal and then the trisaccharide was also transferred to glucuronic acid at the nonreducing terminal of an acceptor. Thus, it was observed that oligosaccharide used as an acceptor became elongated.Thus it appears possible to elongate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains in vitro using the transglycosylation reaction of testicular hyaluronidase. Recently, more attention has been directed toward remodeling of carbohydrate chains using glycosidases from a glycotechnological viewpoint(10Abe J. Hizukuri S. Koizumi K. Kubota Y. Utamura T. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 176: 87-95Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Usui T. Hayashi Y. Nanjo F. Ishido Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Bardales R.M. Bhavanandan V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems feasible to reconstruct various oligosaccharides of GAGs using the transglycosylation reaction of hyaluronidase. In this report, we describe the optimal conditions for promoting selectively the transglycosylation reaction rather than the hydrolysis reaction of testicular hyaluronidase and the synthesis of reconstructed GAGs under these conditions. A system for the reconstruction of GAG chains would open a new avenue in GAG glycotechnology.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicalsBovine testicular hyaluronidase (type 1-S) was purchased from Sigma and was purified according to the method of Borders and Raftery(13Borders Jr., C.L. Raftery M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was free of β-glucuronidase or β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activities, as measured by the method of Barrett(14Barrett A.J. Dingle J.T. Lysosomes. North-Holland Publishing, Amsterdam1972: 110-126Google Scholar). Bovine liver β-glucuronidase was purchased from Sigma. Bovine kidney β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, Streptococcus hyaluronidase, Streptomyces hyaluronidase, chondroitinase AC-II, chondroitinase B, and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-D-gluco-4-enopyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-D-galactose (ΔDi4S) were obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan).Sephadex G-15, G-75, and G-200 were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Bio-Gel P-4 (400 mesh) and AG 1-X2 (200-400 mesh) were obtained from Bio-Rad.PA was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan) and recrystallized from hexane. Sodium cyanoborohydride was purchased from Aldrich. Other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from commercial sources.Preparation of SubstratesFor glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid was prepared from human umbilical cord by the method of Danishefsky and Bella(15Danishefsky I. Bella Jr., A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by further purification by AG 1-X2 chromatography and Sephadex G-200 gel-filtration chromatography as described previously(16Nakamura T. Majima M. Kubo K. Takagaki K. Tamura S. Endo M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The prepared hyaluronic acid contained only glucosamine as hexosamines, and amino acids were not detected. The molecular weight of hyaluronic acid was estimated to be about 800,000 by gel-filtration chromatography. The hyaluronic acid was used as a donor in the transglycosylation reaction.Chondroitin 6-sulfate (Ch6S; from shark cartilage), chondroitin 4-sulfate (Ch4S, from whale cartilage), and dermatan sulfate (DS, from pig skin) were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Chondroitin was prepared from chondroitin 6-sulfate by a modification (17Nakamura T. Takagaki K. Majima M. Kimura S. Kubo K. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5390-5397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the method of Kantor and Schubert(18Kantor T.G. Schubert M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 152-153Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar).GAG oligosaccharides were prepared from hyaluronic acid, chondroitin 6-sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate, and chondroitin using the procedure described in a previous report(19Takagaki K. Kojima K. Majima M. Nakamura T. Kato I. Endo M. Glycoconjugate J. 1992; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each GAG was digested with testicular hyaluronidase. From the digested materials the oligosaccharides (from hexa- to docosasaccharide) were purified through a Bio-Gel P-4 column. Their molecular weights were determined by mass spectrometry. Dermatan sulfate hexasaccharide was prepared using the partial hydrazine degradation method of Maimone and Tollefsen(20Maimone M.M. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Judging from its digestibility with chondroitinase AC-II and B and β-glucuronidase, the uronic acid components of DS hexasaccharides were identified as glucuronic acid and iduronic acid for the carbohydrate residue of the nonreducing terminal and iduronic acid for the internal site of the oligosaccharide.Preparation of PA-oligosaccharidesFluorescence (PA) labeling of the reducing terminal sugar of oligosaccharides was carried out as described previously(19Takagaki K. Kojima K. Majima M. Nakamura T. Kato I. Endo M. Glycoconjugate J. 1992; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each pyridylaminated hexasaccharide (PA-HA hexasaccharide, PA-Ch4S hexasaccharide, PA-Ch6S hexasaccharide, and PA-DS hexasaccharide) was used as an acceptor in the transglycosylation reaction, and PA-HA and PA-Ch4S oligosaccharides were used as standards of molecular weight markers for HPLC.Conditions for the Hydrolysis Reaction Catalyzed by Testicular HyaluronidaseHydrolysis was carried out as follows. Five micrograms of hyaluronic acid as a substrate and 1.0 NFU of testicular hyaluronidase dissolved in 50 μl of 0.5 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.75 M NaCl was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by immersion in a boiling water bath at 100°C for 3 min, and aliquots were then assayed by the method of Reissig et al.(21Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which quantified N-acetylglucosamine at the reducing termini of the oligosaccharides released by the enzyme.Conditions for the Transglycosylation Reaction Catalyzed by Testicular HyaluronidaseA typical transglycosylation reaction was carried out as follows. Five micrograms of GAGs (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin, chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfate, and dermatan sulfate) as donors, 2 nmol of PA-hexasaccharide as an acceptor, and 1.0 NFU of testicular hyaluronidase dissolved in 50 μl of 0.15 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by immersion in a boiling water bath at 100°C for 3 min. Ten micrograms of reaction products was subjected to HPLC.HPLC for PA-oligosaccharidesHPLC for analysis of PA-oligosaccharides was carried out with a PALPAK Type S column (4.0 × 250 mm, Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) under the following conditions: solution A containing 3% acetic acid adjusted to pH 7.3 with triethylamine and acetonitrile at a ratio of 20:80 and solution B containing the same agents at a ratio of 50:50 were prepared; the column was equilibrated with solution A, and the ratio of solution B to solution A was increased linearly to 100% over 60 min after sample injection; the flow rate was fixed at 1.0 ml/min; and the column temperature was 30°C. A Hitachi L-6200 equipped with a fluorescence detector (Model F-1150, Hitachi Co., Tokyo, Japan) was used. Fluorescence of PA was detected at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively.Mass Spectrum MeasurementAll mass spectra were obtained on a Sciex API-III triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source(19Takagaki K. Kojima K. Majima M. Nakamura T. Kato I. Endo M. Glycoconjugate J. 1992; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative mode; the ion spray voltage was set at −4,000 V, the interface plate voltage was −600 V, and the orifice voltage was −100 V. The samples were introduced in 0.5 mM ammonium acetate/acetonitrile (50:50 by volume). A micro-HPLC syringe pump, JASCO Familic 100N (pump = 22, Harvard Apparatus Inc., MA), was used to deliver the samples at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Scanning was done from m/z 300 to 1,200 during the 1-min scan (six cycles). The collisionally activated dissociation spectrum was measured using argon as the collision gas at a collision energy of 40 eV. The daughter ions of the collisionally activated dissociation spectrum were recorded from m/z 200 to 1,000.Enzyme DigestionSamples were digested with the following enzymes: Streptococcus hyaluronidase (0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0)(22Linker A.

Biochem. 1972; 45: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).RESULTSEffect of pH on the Transglycosylation ReactionTo estimate the optimal pH for the transglycosylation reaction, hyaluronic acid (Mr = 800,000) as a donor and PA-HA hexasaccharide as an acceptor were incubated at 37°C for 1 h with testicular hyaluronidase in sodium acetate buffer within a pH range of 3.0-6.0 and in Tris-HCl buffer within a pH range of 6.0-9.0. As PA-HA hexasaccharide was no longer digested with hyaluronidase, as mentioned previously(9Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Izumi J. Saitoh H. Endo M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6503-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), PA-HA hexasaccharide was used as an acceptor for the transglycosylation reaction in order to distinguish it from the donor. After incubation at various pH values, the changes in the chain length of PA-oligosaccharides as the reaction products were determined using HPLC (PALPAK Type S). At a low buffer pH, elongation of the PA-oligosaccharide chain was very slight (Fig. 1). As the pH was increased, PA-oligosaccharides with various chain lengths were observed, the elongation progressing in disaccharide units. The progression of elongation of the PA-oligosaccharides reached a maximum at pH 7.0, when the elongation was observed at least from hexasaccharide to docosasaccharide. However, at pH 9.0, elongation was no longer evident. Representative PA-oligosaccharides that were elongated are plotted in Fig. 1(inset). On the other hand, the optimal pH for hydrolysis by the enzyme was about 5.0, as reported previously(3Highsmith S. Garvin Jr., J.H. Chipman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7473-7480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gorham S.D. Olavesen A.H. Dodgson K.S. Connect. Tissue Res. 1975; 3: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Effect of NaCl Concentration on the Transglycosylation ReactionThe effects of NaCl concentration on the transglycosylation reaction were investigated at various concentrations of NaCl at pH 7.0 at 37°C for 1 h. The elongation of the PA-oligosaccharide decreased with increasing NaCl concentration, and hardly any elongation occurred at a concentration of 0.5 M NaCl (Fig. 2). Therefore, the presence of NaCl was not necessary for the transglycosylation reaction, although hydrolytic activity was dependent on the presence of NaCl, as reported previously(6Gorham S.D. Olavesen A.H. Dodgson K.S. Connect. Tissue Res. 1975; 3: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Effects of NaCl concentration on the transglycosylation reaction. PA-HA hexasaccharide as an acceptor and hyaluronic acid as a donor were incubated with testicular hyaluronidase at 37°C for 1 h in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing various concentrations of NaCl. The reaction products were subjected to HPLC (PALPAK Type S), and the amounts of elongated oligosaccharides were calculated.

It was observed that the PA-oligosaccharides elongated as the reaction products increased with prolonged incubation time and that 80% of the PA-HA hexasaccharide added as the acceptor was used for transglycosylation during the 1-h incubation, the chain length of PA-oligosaccharides reaching docosasaccharide.Figure 3:Time course of PA-HA oligosaccharides produced by the transglycosylation reaction of testicular hyaluronidase. PA-HA hexasaccharide as an acceptor and hyaluronic acid as a donor were incubated with the hyaluronidase at 37°C for 0 (a), 15 (b), 60 (c), and 90 min (d) in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and then subjected to HPLC (PALPAK Type S).

PA-octa-, PA-deca-, and PA-hexadecasaccharide as the representative reaction products detected by HPLC are plotted in Fig. 4. The amounts of the elongated PA-oligosaccharides increased in proportion to the concentration of the acceptor.Figure 4:The effects of acceptor concentration on the transglycosylation reaction.

PA-octa-, PA-deca-, and PA-hexadecasaccharide as representative reaction products detected by HPLC were plotted. The amounts of the elongated PA-oligosaccharides increased with increasing donor concentration up to 0.1% hyaluronic acid; after a further increase to over 0.1%, the amount of the reaction product became maximal.Figure 5:The effects of donor concentration on transglycosylation reaction.

Then the chemical structure of the reconstructed PA-octasaccharide was analyzed by ion spray mass spectrometry (Fig. 6), which revealed multiply charged ions, [M-2H]2-, [M-3H]3-, [M-4H]4-, and [M-5H]5- at m/z 994.2, 662.4, 496.4, and 397.0, respectively. The molecular weight of the PA-oligosaccharide was computed to be 1,990.1 ± 0.3 based on the presence of these ions. Its mass number was the same as that of native PA-HA octasaccharide pyridylaminated directly to the octasaccharide, which was obtained by hyaluronidase digestion of hyaluronic acid.Figure 6:Ion spray mass spectrum of a transglycosylation reaction product. PA-HA hexasaccharide as an acceptor was incubated with hyaluronic acid as a donor under the conditions (pH 7.0) optimal for the transglycosylation reaction for 60 min. A reaction product considered to be PA-HA octasaccharide (bar in Fig. 3c) was recovered and purified by HPLC. Then an aliquot was subjected to ion spray mass spectrometry in 0.5 mM ammonium acetate/acetonitrile (50:50 by volume) at 2 μl/min.

Therefore, it was confirmed that the carbohydrate chains of the reconstructed PA-HA oligosaccharides were very similar to the native hyaluronic acid chain.Chemical Structure of PA-oligosaccharides Produced by the Transglycosylation Reaction from PA-Ch4S Hexasaccharide as an Acceptor and Hyaluronic Acid as a DonorThe chemical structures of the carbohydrate chains produced by the transglycosylation reaction using the various combinations of heterogenic GAGs were investigated. PA-Ch4S hexasaccharide as an acceptor and hyaluronic acid as a donor were incubated with hyaluronidase under the optimal conditions for the transglycosylation reaction at 37°C for 1 h, and the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 7). Three peaks of newly synthesized products (fractions I, II, and III) were observed, which were PA-oligosaccharides elongated by the addition of disaccharide units to the acceptor. Each peak was eluted at a reaction time slightly later than standard PA-Ch4S oligosaccharides. Each fraction was recovered, and its chemical structure was analyzed.Figure 7:HPLC chromatograms of the transglycosylation reaction products produced from PA-Ch4S hexasaccharide as an acceptor and hyaluronic acid as a donor.

It was revealed that a glucuronic acid residue was attached at the reducing terminal. Next, the reconstructed PA-octasaccharide was digested with chondroitinase AC-II and then analyzed by HPLC. The retention time of the digested fluorescent substance was equivalent to the PA-unsaturated disaccharide (ΔDi4S) (Fig. 8c).Figure 8:HPLC of transglycosylation reaction products digested by β-glucuronidase and chondroitinase AC-II.

Triply and quadruply charged molecular ions were observed, from which the molecular weight of this substance was estimated to be 1,851.5 ± 1.8. The molecular mass of the reconstructed PA-octasaccharide was the same as that of the theoretical substance, which was a PA-octasaccharide having a disaccharide unit of hyaluronic acid at the reducing terminal of the Ch4S hexasaccharide.Figure 9:Mass spectrum of transglycosylation reaction products.

Our investigation revealed two cis-acting regulatory elements within this fragment. Deletion of a region extending from −102 to −92 led to an increase of the promoter activity by greater than 10-fold, indicating a presence of a repressor element. Deletion of a region extending from −72 to −62 caused a decrease of the promoter activity of a similar extent, implying the existence of a positive element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that synthetic oligonucleotides derived from these two small regions can each bind with a nuclear protein(s) prepared from myometrial cells, and an introduction of three and two base substitutions into each of these oligomers was sufficient to abolish their protein binding capability. These same mutations, when incorporated in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs, diminished regulatory functions of the negative and positive elements, and the protein(s) that bind to these functional elements was found in several tissues known to express cx43 gene.

Using DH-PBAN cDNA as a probe, we quantitatively measured DH-PBAN mRNA content throughout embryonic and postembryonic development and observed the effects of incubation temperature, which is a key factor for determination of diapause, on DH-PBAN gene expression. The silkworm, which is programmed to lay diapause eggs by being incubated at 25°C, showed peaks of DH-PBAN mRNA content at five different stages throughout the life cycle: at the late embryonic stage, at the middle of the fourth and the fifth larval instars, and at early and late stages of pupal-adult development. In the non-diapause type silkworms programmed by a 15°C incubation, only the last peak of DH-PBAN mRNA in pupal-adult development was found, and the other peaks were absent. Furthermore, interruption of the incubation period at 25°C by incubation at 15°C decreased both DH-PBAN mRNA content in mature embryos and in subesophageal ganglia of day 3 pupae and the incidence of diapause eggs. Thus, there were two types of regulatory mechanisms for DH-PBAN gene expression. One is a temperature-controlled expression that is responsible for diapause induction, and the other is a temperature-independent, stage-dependent expression related to pheromone production.

The first dual-specific PTPase identified corresponded to the H1 open reading frame in Vaccinia virus. This phosphatase was called VH1 for Vaccinia open reading frame H1 and was capable of hydrolyzing phosphate monoesters from both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine containing peptides (Guan et al., 1991), distinguishing this catalyst from the tyrosine-specific PTPases. The VH1-like phosphatases and the PTPases share the active site sequence motif HCxxGxxR, but show limited sequence identity beyond this region. Following the discovery of VH1, it was shown that p80cdc25 (a protein necessary for the passage through mitosis) shared sequence identity to VH1. Several laboratories demonstrated that p80cdc25 had intrinsic tyrosine phosphatase activity and that it would dephosphorylate the cyclin-dependent protein kinase p34cdc2 on Thr-14 and Tyr-15. The dephosphorylation then led to the activation of p34cdc2 and subsequent entry into mitosis (Dunphy and Kumagai, 1991; Galaktionov and Beach 1991; Gautier et al., 1991; Kumagai and Dunphy, 1991; Millar et al., 1991; Strausfeld et al., 1991). protein tyrosine phosphatase vaccinia H1 related isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (bis[2-Hydroxyethyl]imino-tris[hydroxymethyl]methane para-nitrophenylphosphate (2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid) dimethylformamide Nα-tertiary-butoxy-carbonyl mitogen-activated protein polymerase chain reaction high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. Ishibashi et al.,(1992) identified a dual-specific PTPase, VHR (for VH1-Related) using an expression cloning strategy (Fig. 1). The human fibroblast cDNA clone encoded a protein of 185 amino acids. The bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase/VHR fusion protein was shown to be a protein phosphatase with dual specificity based upon its ability to hydrolyze phosphoserine from casein as well as phosphotyrosine from a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors (Ishibashi et al., 1992). Two laboratories have independently identified an identical dual-specific phosphatase (Cdi1 or KAP) (Gyuris et al., 1993; Hannon et al., 1994). Both laboratories demonstrated that Cdi1 (KAP) interacts with the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2 and cdc2, suggesting that these PTPases may be directly involved in cell cycle control. It is important to note that activation of these cyclin-dependent kinases appears to be dependent upon the phosphorylation state of adjacent tyrosine and threonine residues. The list of dual-specific phosphatases (Table 1) includes the mammalian proteins PAC-1 and MKP-1 (Fig. 1). These phosphatases have been shown to dephosphorylate and inactivate threonine- and tyrosine-phosphorylated MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase in vivo (Ward et al., 1994; Sun et al., 1993). MAP kinase must be phosphorylated on adjacent tyrosine 185 and threonine 183 residues for activation (Her et al., 1993). Both MKP-1 and PAC-1 appear to be immediate-early gene products. Dual-specific phosphatases are also present in yeast with recent reports suggesting involvement of MSG5 in the mating pathway (Doi et al., 1994) and of YVH1 in nitrogen regulation (Guan et al., 1992), (Table 1, Fig. 1). Based upon the number of recently reported sequences of dual-specific phosphatases, it would appear that these proteins constitute a large family of catalysts.Table I Open table in a new tab In the few cases that have been investigated, these phosphatases appear to display a marked preference for protein kinases which can be phosphorylated on tyrosine and threonine in close proximity (Table 1). Despite the growing number of dual-specific PTPases identified, little is known about the biochemical mechanisms employed by this family of enzymes. The current investigation begins to explore the catalytic properties of the dual-specific phosphatases. Our strategy was to select a prototype of this class of phosphatases, express and purify large quantities of the recombinant enzyme, characterize the protein biochemically and crystallize the enzyme for x-ray structure determination. Since human VHR contains the catalytic domain which is common to all members of this class (Fig. 1), this enzyme was an ideal choice for analysis. Here, we describe the overexpression, purification, and biochemical and kinetic characterization of VHR. The coding sequence for VHR was amplified using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene). The 5′ PCR primer contained an adapter sequence for the DNA restriction enzyme NdeI, and the 3′ primer contained an EcoRI site downstream of the native stop codon (Zhou et al., 1994). The PCR product was ligated into the PCR™II plasmid (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The coding region was removed by NdeI and EcoRI digestion and ligated into the pT7-7 plasmid to generate pT7-7-VHR. The pT7-7-VHR plasmid was used to transform competent BL21/DE3 bacteria. The transformed bacteria were grown on 2xYT plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Overnight 10-ml cultures originating from isolated colonies were used to inoculate 1 liter of 2xYT containing 140 mg/liter ampicillin. When the growth reached an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added at 100 mg/liter, and the bacteria were grown for an additional 8 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g, resuspended in 15 ml/liter culture of 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (pH 7.4), and lysed by pressure (1200 pounds/square inch) using a French Pressure Cell Press (American Instrument Co. Inc.). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g (20 min), and 0.5% polyethylene imine was added to the soluble extract to precipitate polynucleotides and their associated proteins. After 15 min of stirring at 4°C, the precipitate were removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g. Ammonium sulfate was added at 35% of saturation, stirred for 15 min, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min. To the supernatant, ammonium sulfate was added up to 65%, stirred, and centrifuged as before. The resulting pellet was dissolved in a minimum of 20 mM MES, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (pH 6) and dialyzed against 500 ml of the same buffer for 90 min. The dialysate was loaded onto a 50-ml S-Sepharose (Sigma) cation-exchange column pre-equilibrated with MES buffer. The column was then washed with 500 ml of the MES buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with a 0-0.6 M linear NaCl gradient of 400 ml. VHR elutes at 300 mM NaCl. Fractions containing high phosphatase activity with para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) were pooled and concentrated to between 5-10 ml by filtration (Centricon-3 or 10 Concentrator by Amicon). The concentrated solution was loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column (2.5 × 100 cm) and eluted with 270 ml of 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). Fractions exhibiting phosphatase activity were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to assess the purity. All fractions which contained only a single band corresponding to VHR were pooled and concentrated by filtration to a final concentration of 0.2-0.5 mM. The enzyme was stored at −20°C in 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), until use. Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI) of the purified protein was performed on a VESTEC-2000 instrument. Amino acid analysis of the purified enzyme was performed on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) instrument which was composed of three integrated modules: the Applied Biosystems model 420H hydrolyzer/derivatizer, the Applied Biosystems model 130A Separation System, and the Applied Biosystems model 610 Data System. NH2-terminal protein sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 473A sequenator. The phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids were identified and quantitated by HPLC and the Applied Biosystems model 610a. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system using a Superose 12 column and a mobile phase buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), flowing at a rate of 0.25 ml/min. Synthesis of peptides followed typical FMOC/t-butyl protecting strategies and standard cycles on an Applied Biosystems/Perkin Elmer model-431 peptide synthesizer using HBTU and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole for activation. FMOC amino acids were from Synthetec, tetrazole from Glen Research, di-benzyl-N′,N′-diisopropyl-phosphoramidite was from Novabiochem. Other reagents were from Applied Biosystems/Perkin Elmer and solvents were peptide synthesis grade from Fisher. Purification of the phosphorylated peptides was on a Rainin Dynamax reversed-phase HPLC column using an acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity of all peptides was verified by analytical reversed-phase HPLC and the structure was verified by amino acid analysis and electrospray or laser desorption mass spectrometry. The general approach to phosphopeptide synthesis used in this study, global phosphorylation, involved post-synthetic phosphorylation while the peptide was still attached to the solid-phase support with all of its protecting groups intact except those on selected hydroxyl groups (Kitas et al., 1991; Andrews et al., 1991). The hydroxyamino acids were introduced during synthesis as the FMOC-amino acids with no side chain protection. Tyr, Thr, and Ser residues which were not to be phosphorylated contained t-butyl ether protecting groups. The NH2-terminal amino acid was incorporated as the t-Boc-protected amino acid. The resin was dried for 24 h on a vacuum system at room temperature before swelling in anhydrous DMF. Reaction with a 20-fold molar excess of the phosphoramidite and 50-fold molar excess of tetrazole for 1-2 h was similar to previous reports (Kitas et al., 1991; Andrews et al., 1991). The resin was washed thoroughly with dry DMF and then subjected to oxidation with 0.5 Mt-butyl peroxide in DMF for times ranging from 0.5 to 4 h at room temperature. The phosphorylated peptide resin was then washed thoroughly with DMF, methylene chloride, dried, and subjected to cleavage and deprotection in 90% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% thioanisole, 3% ethanedithiol, 2% anisole. The cleaved peptide was then precipitated by addition of 15 volumes cold diethylether. One of the synthetic peptides (DHTGFLpTEpYVATR) exhibited only low levels of phosphorylation. The use of alternative solvents or longer reaction times did not significantly improve the extent of phosphorylation. This was attributed to steric effects of the amino-terminal segment since shorter forms of this peptide were quite efficiently phosphorylated. The approach used was to synthesize the peptide by normal procedures except that the synthesis was stopped after 8 residues, the FMOC protecting group left on the Leu residue, and the peptide resin subjected to the normal phosphorylation protocol. After the oxidation step, the peptide was thoroughly washed and placed back on the synthesizer, and the last 5 amino acid residues coupled. A significant amount of dephosphorylation occurred at the Thr residue during the piperidine deprotection step in the subsequent cycles. This was reduced by shortening the piperidine deprotection step in each cycle and incorporating a t-Boc-protected amino acid in the amino-terminal position. Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated MAP kinase by VHR was determined using the method of Zheng and Guan(1993). Three different types of quantitative enzymatic assays were employed in these studies. A three-component buffer consisting of 0.05 M Tris, 0.05 M Bis-Tris, and 0.1 M acetate was used in all the kinetic analyses. This buffer maintains constant ionic strength over its useful pH range (Ellis and Morrison, 1982). Since preliminary studies (data not shown) indicated that enzymatic activity was sensitive to ionic strength, maintaining constant ionic strength was critical. This buffer exhibited no inhibitory effects on enzymatic activity. All assays were performed at 30°C. Using pNPP as a substrate, the phosphatase reaction was followed as an increase in absorbance at 405 nm of the product para-nitrophenolate (Zhang and Van Etten, 1991). Initial rates were determined from the change in absorbance upon addition of 1 N NaOH. Rates were determined over the linear region of the reaction using the molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 M-1 cm-1 for the product para-nitrophenolate. Inital rates at various initial substrate concentrations were then fit directly to the Michaelis-Menten using the nonlinear least-squares program Kinetasyst for the Macintosh (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA). v=Vmax*S/(Km+S)(Eq. 1) A continuous spectrophotometric assay described previously by Zhang et al. (1993) was employed to follow the dephosphorylation of various phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. This assay takes advantage of the difference in absorbance at 282 nm between phosphotyrosine and tyrosine and can be utilized to follow the complete time course of the enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphotyrosine containing peptides. Initial concentrations of peptide ranged from 0.3 to 1.8 mM. The complete time course of the reaction can be fitted to the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten using a nonlinear least-squares algorithm (Yamaoka et al., 1981). This method has been successfully used in the determination of the kinetic parameters for the reaction between phosphotyrosine peptides and RatPTP1 and the Yersinia PTPase (Zhang et al., 1993). This progress curve analysis yielded the identical values to those determined by typical initial rate analysis. However, because the build up of phosphate can begin to inhibit the reaction as more phosphopeptide is converted to product, was modified to to account for the slight inhibition by phosphate. Since dephosphorylated peptides do not bind to the PTPases (Zhang et al., 1993; Cho et al., 1991), no correction for inhibition by this product was necessary. In, E0 is the enzyme concentration, p∞ is the product concentration upon complete reaction, p is the product concentrationa t time t, and Ki is the inhibition constant for phosphate. The peptide dephosphorylation data were fit to and kinetic parameters kcat, Km and kcat/Km were obtained. t=p/kcatE0+(Km/kcatE0)ln[p∞/(p∞-p)](Eq. 2) t=p/kcatE0+[(1+(p/Ki))Km/kcatE0]ln[p∞/(p∞-p)](Eq. 3) The third method involved reverse phase HPLC separation and quantitation of the substrates and products from the reaction of VHR with DHTGFLpTEpYVATR and F(Nle)(Nle)pTPpYVVTR. The DHTGFLpTEpYVATR phosphopeptide corresponded to the putative activation sites on MAP177-189 (mitogen-activated protein) kinase, whereas the F(Nle)(Nle)pTPpYVVTR phosphopeptide corresponded to the activation sites of JNK1180-189 (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase). With this method, the rate of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis at phosphothreonine of both peptides was determined. A Vydac C18 (0.21 × 25 cm) column was attached to an Applied Biosystems 130A Separation System HPLC instrument with UV detection set at 220 nm. The peptides were eluted (150 μl/min) over 60 min using a linear gradient of 15-35% B (80% acetonitrile, 20% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Solution A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The retention times of DHTGFLpTEpYVATR in the various phosphorylation states -pTEpY-, -TEpY-, -TEY-, and -pTEY- were 30.6, 31.6, 43.8, and 47.3 min, respectively. The peptide corresponding to JNK1 kinase (F(Nle)(Nle)pTPpYVVTR) was analyzed in an identical fashion except for the following changes. The peptides were eluted over 60 min using a linear gradient of 20-60% B. The retention times of F(Nle)(Nle)pTPpYVVTR in the various phosphorylation states -pTPpY-, -pTPY-, and -TPY- were 22.8, 27.1, and 28.3 min, respectively. In the F(Nle)(Nle)pTPpYVVTR peptide, Nor-leucine was substituted for methionine (found in the native protein) because of the technical problem of oxidation of the thiol during synthesis. Nor-leucine is similar in size and has the same stereochemistry as methionine. All peaks were resolved and were verified by MALDI mass spectral analysis and by coelution with the corresponding authentic peptide. To quench the reaction, an equal volume of 1.5 M acetic acid was added to the aliquot before injection of 15-20 μl of this sample for HPLC separation. Peaks of the dephosphorylated peptide were collected, and the amount of peptide was determined by amino acid analysis. The concentration of dephosphopeptide was then determined as a function of time and fitted to the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten. Control experiments with no added enzyme indicated that background hydrolysis was negligible. A variety of oxyanions were tested as inhibitors of VHR. The inhibition constant Ki was determined in the following manner. At various fixed concentrations of inhibitor, the initial velocity at different pNPP concentrations was measured as described above. For all inhibitors analyzed, the inhibition was competitive with respect to substrate. The data were fit to (Kinetasyst) to yield the inhibition constant Ki. v=Vmax*S/(Km*[1+I/Ki])+S(Eq. 4) The dual-specific PTPase, VHR, was purified as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” The coding sequence of VHR was placed behind the bacteriophage T7 promoter in the pT7-7 plasmid. Induction of the transformed bacterial cultures with IPTG gave high levels of expression of the protein. As indicated in Table 2, approximately 30-40 mg of pure enzyme (30% yield) was routinely obtained from 3 liters of bacterial culture. After elution of VHR from the S-Sepharose cation-exchange column, the enzyme was judged to be at least 95% pure based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (lane 3 in Fig. 2). Further purification on the Sephadex G-75 column resulted in a homogeneous preparation of enzyme (lane 4 in Fig. 2). This preparation was used in all subsequent studies. There was no loss of enzymatic activity after 10 months of storage at −20°C. Above pH 6, the enzyme retained 100% of its activity after incubation at 30°C for 3 days. Below pH 4.5, the enzyme rapidly denatures (data not shown). No significant drop in activity was observed after six cycles of freezing (−20°C) and thawing (30°C).Table II Open table in a new tab To establish the oligomeric state of the enzyme, VHR was subjected to size exclusion chromatography as outlined under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 3). The purified enzyme was injected onto the column at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The elution time corresponded to a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 20,600, which was in good agreement with the mass of the monomer predicted by amino acid sequence composition (20,500 for 185 amino acids). To establish the integrity of the purified enzyme, VHR was subjected to mass spectral, amino acid, and amino-terminal sequence analysis. The first six cycles of amino-terminal sequencing established that the protein begins with Ser-Gly-Ser-Phe-Glu-Leu. This is identical to the predicted sequence except that the initiator Met was removed. Amino acid analysis and the amino acid content predicted by the cDNA sequence were in excellent agreement (data not shown). Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry analysis yielded an apparent mass of 20,500 ± 100, in good agreement with the predicted molecular weight. Consistent with these results, the purified enzyme contains 184 amino acids with a molecular weight of 20,400. Based upon amino acid analysis and UV absorbance measurements of purified VHR, the molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm was 11,500 M-1 cm-1. All subsequent concentrations of VHR were determined by using this molar extinction coefficient. The inhibition constant Ki was determined for tungstate, vanadate, and phosphate at pH 6. The Ki for arsenate inhibition was determined previously (Zhou et al., 1994). All displayed competitive inhibition with respect to substrate (data not shown). The Ki values for arsenate, tungstate, vanadate, and phosphate were 20.9 ± 0.7, 689 ± 108, 32.3 ± 8.1, and 969 ± 120 mM, respectively. Crystallization conditions for VHR (10 mg/ml in 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.2) were screened using the sparse matrix sampling method (Jancarik and Kim, 1991; Crystal Screen I, Hampton Research) and hanging-drop vapor diffusion techniques. The initial condition (0.2 M Li2SO4, 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 M Tris ((pH 8.5) screening solution 17)) was optimized to grow single crystals at 22°C (Fig. 4). Repeated macroseeding yielded VHR crystals (typical size: 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3) that diffract to at least 2 Å resolution on an SDMS multiwire area detector (Rigaku RU200, 50 kV, 100 mA). The crystal was of space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 61.08 Å, b = 60.14 Å, c = 51.94 Å, α = γ = 90°, and β = 98.35°. We estimated the crystal to be 47% solvent for two 20.4-kDa molecules/asymmetric unit. However, crystal density determination and self-rotation functions will be necessary to conclusively rule out the possibility of one molecule/asymmetric unit (74% solvent). A complete native data set to 2.5 Å has been collected, and data collection from potential heavy atom derivatives is in progress. There was in vivo evidence that at least two of the dual-specific phosphatases catalyze the dephosphorylation of activated MAP kinase (Ward et al., 1994; Sun et al., 1993). Ward et al.(1994) have pointed out that there are numerous MAP kinase-like proteins, all of which appear to require phosphorylation on a similar -TxY- sequence. We initially examined MAP kinase as a substrate for VHR. The enzyme dephosphorylated MAP kinase on both threonine and tyrosine residues (data not shown). The difficulty in obtaining stoichiometrically diphosphorylated MAP kinase which incorporates 1 mol of phosphate at threonine 183 as well as 1 mol of phosphate at tyrosine 185 makes detailed kinetic analysis of partially phosphorylated MAP kinase problematic. For this reason, we devised an in vitro assay using synthetic peptides corresponding to the activation sites of MAP kinase as well as other kinases having the -TxY- motif. To explore the dual specificity and the substrate specificity of VHR, the kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were determined for a variety of synthetic peptides including diphosphorylated MAP177-189 (DHTGFLpTEpYVATR) kinase and JNK1180-189 kinase (F(Nle)(Nle)pTPpYVVTR), (Table 3). Phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation can be followed continuously using the spectrophotometric methods (Fig. 5) described under “Materials and Methods.” The kcat/Km parameter is the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction between free substrate and free enzyme and involves both the steps in binding of substrate and catalysis. The kcat/Km value is therefore an excellent indicator of the quality of a particular substrate. On the other hand, the kinetic parameter kcat involves only the steps in catalysis and product release. The diphosphorylated peptides corresponding to MAP and JNK kinases (Table 3) yielded the highest kcat/Km values of all substrates, 32,300 and 26,600 M-1 s-1, respectively. For comparison, the Neu347-357 (DAEEpYLVPQQG) peptide (Zhang et al., 1993), monophosphorylated on tyrosine, yielded a kcat/Km value of 4080 M-1 s-1 that was only slightly higher than pNPP (3240 M-1 s-1). For VHR, the tyrosine-monophosphorylated MAP kinase peptide DHTGFLTEpYVATR yielded a kcat/Km value of 11,200 M-1 s-1.Table III Open table in a new tab Because the continuous spectrophotometric assay for phosphotyrosine-specific hydrolysis was invisible to the hydrolysis at phosphothreonine, we developed an HPLC-based assay that would allow us to monitor all possible reactions within a single experiment. This method can provide information on the order of hydrolysis at each site as well as the relative rates of hydrolysis. The apparent second-order rate constant kcat/Km for dephosphorylation of phosphothreonine on the diphosphorylated DHTGFLpTEpYVATR (MAP177-189 kinase) and F(NLe)(NLe)pTPpYVVTR (JNK1180-189 kinase) peptides was determined by utilizing HPLC to separate and quantitate all four possible phosphorylation states, -TxY-, -pTxY-, -TxpY-, and -pTxpY-, as described under “Materials and Methods.” All peaks in the HPLC elution profiles were identified by a combination of mass spectral analysis and by comparison with the retention times of the authentic peptides. Fig. 6 shows the elution profile at different reaction times when VHR was reacted with diphosphorylated MAP177-189 kinase peptide DHTGFLpTEpYVATR. Within the first 6 min, the DHTGFLpTEpYVATR peptide was rapidly (32,000 M-1 s-1) and completely dephosphorylated on tyrosine, thus generating phosphothreonine peptide DHTGFLpTEYVATR which was then slowly hydrolyzed by VHR, yielding completely dephosphorylated peptide DHTGFLTEYVATR. No detectable amount of monophosphorylated phosphotyrosine peptide was observed in these experiments with either MAP177-189 kinase or JNK1180-189 kinase. The amount of unlabeled peptide was calculated by amino acid analysis of the peak and was correlated with peak area to determine the concentration of peptide at each time point. Alternatively, the amount of peptide formed was determined by correlating the peak area to the amount of starting peptide. Fig. 7 shows the data from the time course of reaction for hydrolysis at phosphothreonine with diphosphorylated MAP177-189 kinase peptide (DHTGFLpTEpYVATR) and the fit to the integrated Michaelis-Menten. The fit yielded a kcat/Km value of 13.5 ± 0.3 M-1 s-1 (pH 6) which was about 200-fold lower than the rate obtained with pNPP and about 2000-fold slower than phosphotyrosine hydrolysis on the same diphosphorylated peptide. Because the phosphothreonine peptide substrate DHTGFLpTEYVATR was not present at saturating levels (i.e.Km ≫1 mM), the parameter kcat could not be determined with good accuracy. At pH 7, the kcat/Km value decreased to 3.5 ± 0.3 M-1 s-1, consistent with the decrease in values seen with both the phosphotyrosine peptides and pNPP as substrates. These results suggest that the pH optimum is close to pH 6, with activity decreasing at higher pH. Using the same HPLC-based analysis, a similar kcat/Km value of 16.8 ± 0.3 M-1 s-1 for phosphothreonine hydrolysis of diphosphorylated JNK1180-189 kinase peptide (F(NLe)(NLe)pTPpYVVTR) was determined.Figure 7:Phosphothreonine hydrolysis of diphosporylated MAP177-189 kinase peptide (DHTGFLpTEpYVATR) catalyzed by VHR. Data points represent the quantitation of the results shown in Fig. 6 as described under “Materials and Methods.” Solid line is a fit of the data to.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have described a simple and convenient purification strategy for obtaining large amounts of the native human dual-specific PTPase VHR. Because results obtained from kinetic and biochemical analyses can be altered by engineered proteins, VHR was overexpressed as the native enzyme coded for by its cDNA sequence and not as a fusion protein nor as a histidine-tagged protein. This has enabled us to crystallize the enzyme for structure determination, physically characterize the enzyme and investigate its substrate specificity. Other than demonstrating the general phosphatase activity of this growing class of PTPases, there has been no report on the details of this reaction, the relative rates of dephosphorylation on the putative Thr-183 and Tyr-185 of MAP kinase and the substrate requirements of this important class of enzymes. After VHR was purified to homogeneity, numerous physical methods were performed to ensure the integrity of the enzyme. Results from amino acid analysis, MALDI mass spectral analysis, and size-exclusion chromatography are consistent with the predicted mass of 20.4 kDa. With NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing revealing that the initiator Met was cleaved, the protein contains 184 amino acids. Once the integrity of the enzyme was confirmed, the substrate specificity was determined. VHR will effectively dephosphorylate purified recombinant MAP kinase; however, because phosphorylation of MAP kinase by MAP kinase kinase was never stoichiometric on both tyrosine 185 and threonine 183, an alternative assay was developed to unambiguously determine the rates of dephosphorylation. Using stoichiometrically diphosphorylated MAP177-189 kinase (DHTGFLpTEpYVATR) and JNK1180-189 kinase (F(Nle)(Nle)pTPpYVVTR) peptides in the continuous spectrophotometric assay and the HPLC method described here, the rates of the VHR-catalyzed hydrolysis at each site were determined. The diphosphorylated peptides are clearly the best substrates in terms of phosphotyrosine hydrolysis, with Km values between 100 and 200 μM and kcat/Km values of 30,000 M-1 s-1. In comparison, peptides monophosphorylated on tyrosine have Km values above 1 mM. When the diphosphorylated peptides are reacted with VHR, no monophosphotyrosine peptide was ever detected, indicating that the dephosphorylation is ordered. The phosphotyrosine residue is rapidly hydrolyzed first at a rate of 30,000 M-1 s-1 followed by the slow (15 M-1 s-1) rate of hydrolysis at the threonine position (Fig. 8). Both the dual-specific PTPases and the PTPases contain an essential cysteine residue that is thought to be the nucleophile which attacks the phosphorus atom, forming a thiol-phosphate intermediate along the catalytic pathway. We have previously established the importance of Cys-124 in the VHR-catalyzed reaction toward both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine containing peptides (Zhou et al., 1994). When this cysteine is replace with serine, the enzyme is functionally inactive toward both types of substrates, suggesting a similar mechanism and the same active site with both types of substrates. The proposed intermediate was trapped and characterized when VHR was mixed with [32P]phosphotyrosine-labeled Raytide. However, attempts to trap the intermediate with phosphoserine/threonine-containing peptides failed. This apparent inconsistency can be explained with the results observed in the current study. The amount of intermediate formed in the reaction is directly proportional to the ratio of the net rate of breakdown to the net rate of formation of the intermediate. Given that the kcat/Km value for phosphothreonine peptide hydrolysis is about three orders of magnitude slower than hydrolysis of phosphotyrosine containing peptide, the amount of intermediate would also be expected to drop by the same magnitude. The kcat/Km parameter involves the steps of binding through the release of the first product, the alcohol. Thus, this rate constant measures the net rate of formation of the intermediate. Since a common thiol-phosphate intermediate would be formed with both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine substrates, the rate of breakdown of the intermediate is expected to be identical. As a result, the levels of trapped intermediate with phosphoserine/threonine substrates would be negligible and therefore undetectable by the described trapping method.

The hemolytic activity of CEL-III was also Ca2+-dependent and was found to be inhibited by galactose or GalNAc-containing carbohydrates, suggesting that the hemolysis was caused by CEL-III binding to specific carbohydrates on the erythrocyte membrane by Ca2+-dependent lectin activity, followed by partial destruction of the membrane.

INTRODUCTIONAnimal lectins have been of great interest recently, as their various important functions in organisms are being suggested. Most animal lectins have been classified into one of two groups, i.e. Ca2+-dependent (C-type) and independent (S-type or galectin)(1Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N.W. Cummings R.D. Drickamer K. Feizi T. Gitt M.A. Hirabayashi J. Hughes C. Kasai K.

In vertebrates, C-type lectins are classified into six groups, which include proteoglycan core protein, hepatic lectin, mannose-binding protein, and selectin(3Drickamer K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These proteins are composed of C-type CRDs, 1The abbreviations used are: CRDcarbohydrate recognition domainPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTBSTris-buffered saline. which exhibit some degree of homology with each other, and additional domains or regions with the characteristic functions of individual proteins. C-type lectins purified from invertebrates, on the other hand, are generally smaller than those from vertebrates, and many of them consist of only a single CRD. One of the most probable roles of invertebrate C-type lectins is to act as humoral factors in the defense mechanism, as do immunoglobulins in vertebrates; enhanced fly lectin production after injury to the body wall and its activation of phagocytes in vitro have been demonstrated(4Komano H. Mizuno D. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2919-2924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nakajima H. Komano H. Esumi-Kurisu M. Abe S. Yamazaki M. Natori S. Mizuno D.

Gann. 1983; 74: 576-583PubMed Google Scholar), and it has also been suggested that this lectin plays an important role during developmental stages.Some C-type lectins have been isolated from marine invertebrates, such as a sea urchin (Anthocidaris crassispina)(7Giga Y. Ikai A. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6197-6203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an acorn barnacle (Megabalanus rosa)(8Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1039: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a tunicate (Polyandrocarpa misakiensis)(9Suzuki T. Takagi T. Furukohri T. Kawamura K. Nakauchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1274-1281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a sea cucumber (Stichopus japonicus)(10Himeshima T. Hatakeyama T. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have recently purified four galactose/GalNAc-specific Ca2+-dependent lectins (CEL-I-CEL-IV) from the marine invertebrate Cucumaria echinata(11Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and we have determined the complete and partial amino acid sequences of CEL-IV and CEL-I, respectively. 2T. Hatakeyama, K. Ohuchi, M. Kuroki, S. Nishinohara, and N. Yamasaki, manuscript in preparation. It was found from the determined sequences that these two lectins have apparent structural homology with other C-type lectins, especially with those from marine invertebrates. Interestingly, CEL-III exhibited strong hemolytic activity when incubated with human and rabbit erythrocytes, while only weak agglutination was observed with chicken and horse erythrocytes. The hemolytic activity of CEL-III was inhibited by several galactose or GalNAc-containing carbohydrates and was prevented in the presence of EDTA, suggesting that the hemolysis was caused by CEL-III binding to galactose or GalNAc-containing carbohydrates on the erythrocyte membrane by Ca2+-dependent lectin activity, followed by partial destruction of the membrane.Hemolytic and cytolytic proteins have been isolated from various origins(12Ryoyama K.

Immunol. 1993; 182: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the interaction of CEL-III with the erythrocyte membrane as well as with artificial lipid vesicles, in order to elucidate the mechanism for hemolysis by CEL-III.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe C. echinata samples were a generous gift from N. Ikeda (Fukuoka Fisheries and Marine Technology Research Center). The samples were stored at −30°C until use. Chicken, horse, and rabbit blood samples were obtained from Nippon Bio-Test Laboratories (Tokyo). Inulin and egg yolk phosphatidylcholine were obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto). Dextran 4 and dextran 8 were from Serva. Luciferase-luciferin and human globoside were products of Sigma. Cellulofine GCL-2000-c was from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Organon Teknika (West Chester, PA).Preparation of Lactosyl-Cellulofine and GalNAc-Cellulofine ColumnsThe columns were prepared by cross-linking lactose or GalNAc with Cellulofine GCL-2000-c using divinyl sulfone as described by Teichberg et al.(29Teichberg V.I. Aberdam D. Erez U. Pinelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14086-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Purification of CEL-IIIIn a previous paper we reported the purification of the four C. echinata lectins by column chromatography using lactosyl-Sepharose 4B, Sephacryl S-200, and Q-Sepharose(11Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study we also used a newly developed procedure, described below, which involved two affinity columns, i.e. lactosyl- and GalNAc-Cellulofine columns, to facilitate the separation of CEL-III.C. echinata body fluid (350 ml) was taken, and CaCl2 was added to 10 mM. This solution was applied to a lactosyl-Cellulofine column (3.6 × 9 cm) equilibrated with TBS (10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl) and 10 mM CaCl2. After washing the column with the same buffer, adsorbed proteins were eluted with 20 mM EDTA followed by 0.1 M lactose in TBS. CEL-I and CEL-III were eluted from the column with 20 mM EDTA, and CEL-IV with 0.1 M lactose, whereas CEL-II was not retained in this column. The fraction containing a mixture of CEL-I and CEL-III was further separated using the GalNAc-Cellulofine column (1.3 × 2 cm) with the same buffer after dialysis against TBS and addition of CaCl2 to 10 mM. Since CEL-I has an extremely high affinity for GalNAc in addition to a moderate affinity for galactose-containing carbohydrates(11Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), CEL-I was bound to the column more strongly than CEL-III, so the former was eluted with 0.1 M lactose, while the latter had to be eluted with 20 mM EDTA. A small amount of CEL-III aggregate was sometimes observed with this preparation, which could be removed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. The CEL-III purified by this method exhibited the same specific activity as that purified by the previous method(11Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Chromatography was performed at 7°C. The proteins thus purified were dialyzed against TBS and stored frozen at −30°C.Protein DeterminationProtein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid by the method given by Smith et al.(30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenke D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Determination of Hemolytic ActivityHemolytic activity of CEL-III was determined by the absorbance at 540 nm due to hemoglobin released from the erythrocytes. CEL-III in TBS containing 10 mM CaCl2 (100 μl) was mixed with the same volume of erythrocyte suspension (10%, v/v) in the same buffer. After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged, and lysis was determined by the supernatant's absorbance at 540 nm.AntiserumAnti-CEL-III antiserum was produced in mice using CEL-III purified by the previous method (11Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as the antigen. Initially, 20 μg of protein in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected intraperitoneally. Booster injections of the same amount of the protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were administered twice, at 3-week intervals. Blood was taken 1 week after the final injection, and the antiserum was prepared.ImmunoblottingA 5% (v/v) erythrocyte suspension was incubated with CEL-III (10 μg/ml) in 1 ml of TBS containing 10 mM CaCl2 for 15 min at 20°C. After lysis had been completed, the membrane was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min and serially washed twice with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, once with the same buffer containing 0.1 M lactose, and once with the same buffer containing 10 mM EDTA. One-fifth of the membrane pellet was solubilized with the sample buffer containing 1% SDS and then subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins separated in the polyacrylamide gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in the transfer buffer (20% ethanol, 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS) for 3 h at 180 mA. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS (blocking buffer) for 60 min at room temperature, then incubated with mouse anti-CEL-III antiserum (1000-fold dilution), followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (2000-fold dilution), in the blocking buffer at room temperature for 60 min. Proteins were detected by incubating the membrane with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.08% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.05% H2O2.Measurement of ATP Release from ErythrocytesATP released from rabbit erythrocytes was measured by the firefly assay(31DeLuca M. McElroy W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 57: 3-15Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). A 10% (v/v) suspension of rabbit erythrocytes was incubated with CEL-III (16 μg/ml) in 0.8 ml of TBS containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 15 mM dextran 8 at 20°C. After centrifugation, 0.2 ml of supernatant was mixed with 0.1 ml of luciferase-luciferin solution (10 mg/ml), and its luminescence was measured at 560 nm (band path 10 nm) using a Hitachi 650-10SC fluorescence spectrophotometer without an excitation light.Preparation of Liposomes Containing CarboxyfluoresceinEgg yolk phosphatidylcholine (20 mg) and human globoside (0.4 mg) were dissolved in 0.5 ml of chloroform and dried under reduced pressure in a conical glass tube. After addition of 1 ml of TBS containing 0.1 M carboxyfluorescein, the lipids were hydrated by vortex mixing for 15 min at room temperature. The suspension was then sonicated for 10 min at room temperature using a Tomy Seiko UR-200P ultrasonic disruptor, and subjected to gel filtration on a column of Cellulofine GCL-2000-c in TBS. The fractions containing small unilamellar vesicles were collected.Measurement of the Release of Carboxyfluorescein from the LiposomesThe liposome trapping 0.1 M carboxyfluorescein in 0.5 ml of TBS containing 10 mM CaCl2 was mixed with CEL-III (0.45 μg/ml) in 0.1 ml of the same buffer at 20°C. The fluorescence of carboxyfluorescein at 523 nm excited at 470 nm was measured at appropriate intervals using a Hitachi 650-10SC fluorescence spectrophotometer.RESULTSTemperature and pH Dependence of the Hemolytic Activity of CEL-IIIOur previous results suggested that hemolysis by CEL-III was caused by the interaction of CEL-III with the erythrocyte membrane after it has bound to the Gal/GalNAc-containing carbohydrates on the erythrocyte surface(11Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To obtain information on the nature of the interaction between CEL-III and the erythrocyte membrane, we examined the hemolytic activity under different conditions. As shown in Fig. 1A, when the hemolytic activity of CEL-III was measured at various temperatures using rabbit erythrocytes, the highest activity was observed at 10°C, but activity decreased with increasing temperature. At 30°C, the hemolysis had decreased to 25% of that at 10°C. It is evident that such a decrease in hemolytic activity at higher temperatures is not due to the instability of the protein, since the hemolytic activity of CEL-III was retained after incubation at up to 50°C for 30 min (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the hemolysis is not an enzymatic reaction and might depend largely on the binding of CEL-III to the specific carbohydrates on the surface of the erythrocyte. On the other hand, the remarkable decrease in the activity below 10°C might be related to reduced membrane fluidity at low temperatures. Fig. 2 shows the pH dependence profile of the hemolytic activity and stability of CEL-III. The hemolytic activity of CEL-III increased with increasing pH up to pH 10, while almost no hemolysis was observed below pH 6.5 (Fig. 2A). However, after pretreatment at different pH values for 15 h, a decrease in hemolytic activity was observed only in the acidic region below pH 5 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the low activity in the acidic region shown in Fig. 2A was not due to irreversible inactivation of the protein. This might reflect the presence of some ionizable group of amino acid residue with a pKa around 9-10, which is involved in the hemolytic activity.Figure 2:pH dependence of the hemolytic activity (A) and pH stability (B) of CEL-III. The following buffers were used for both experiments. pH 2, 0.01 M HCl; pH 3-5.5, 10 mM sodium acetate buffer; pH 6-7, 10 mM Bis-Tris-HCl buffer; pH 7.5-8.5, 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer; pH 9-10, 10 mM sodium borate buffer. A, activity measurements were performed, in duplicate, with 0.5 μg/ml (○) or 5 μg/ml (•) CEL-III and 5% rabbit erythrocytes in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl and 10 mM CaCl2. B, pH stability was measured after treating CEL-III in the buffers at the pH values indicated for 15 h at room temperature, followed by dialysis against TBS containing 10 mM CaCl2. The protein concentration was adjusted to 5 μg/ml. The value for the erythrocytes lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 (A) or the highest value indicated (B) was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Immunoblotting AnalysisSince there was a possibility that the erythrocyte membrane had been damaged by the irreversible binding of CEL-III, the interaction between CEL-III and the erythrocytes was examined by immunoblotting analysis of the proteins solubilized from the erythrocyte membranes treated with CEL-III (Fig. 3). In this experiment, the erythrocyte membranes treated with CEL-III were washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 M lactose, followed by the same buffer containing 10 mM EDTA, to remove any CEL-III bound to the membrane by its carbohydrate binding ability. The proteins solubilized from the membranes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis. The results clearly showed high molecular mass protein reacting with anti-CEL-III antiserum in the membranes from rabbit and human erythrocytes (Fig. 3A, lanes2 and 3) but not in those from horse and chicken erythrocytes. This suggests that CEL-III was tightly bound to the membranes of rabbit and human erythrocytes in an aggregated form, in accordance with the fact that these erythrocytes are susceptible to the hemolytic action of CEL-III. It is apparent that these aggregates were derived from the CEL-III monomer, since the antiserum used in this experiment was raised against the monomer protein purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200(11Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when native CEL-III was subjected to SDS-PAGE, high molecular mass bands were often observed in addition to the monomer band. These high molecular mass species were also confirmed to be aggregates of CEL-III by the reaction with the antiserum (Fig. 3B), indicating that even native CEL-III has a tendency to form aggregates under the conditions for SDS-PAGE. The aggregates formed during SDS-PAGE are apparently different from those induced by interaction with the erythrocyte membranes, since the former always appear as multiple bands of smaller molecular size than the latter.Figure 3:Immunoblotting of the erythrocyte membranes treated with CEL-III (A) and aggregates of CEL-III formed on SDS-PAGE (B). A, the membranes prepared from the CEL-III-treated erythrocytes were solubilized with sample buffer containing 1% SDS and subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. After electrophoretic transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, CEL-III was detected with mouse anti-CEL-III antiserum.

Experientia (Basel). 1987; 43: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Mangel A. Leitão J.M. Batel R. Zimmermann H. Müller W.E.G. Schröder H.C. Eur. J.

A. 1986; 83: 5668-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined this possibility by performing the osmotic protection experiment using several carbohydrates as protectants. As shown in Fig. 4, when rabbit erythrocytes were incubated with CEL-III in the presence of several carbohydrates with varying molecular masses, lysis was inhibited increasingly as the size of the carbohydrates increased; sucrose and melezitose gave only slight protection against lysis of rabbit erythrocytes, whereas inulin, dextran 4 (4-6 kDa), and dextran 8 (8-12 kDa) gave 62%, 98%, and 99% protection against lysis, respectively. Moreover, washing the erythrocytes treated with CEL-III in the presence of 15 mM dextran 8 with TBS resulted in immediate lysis of the cells. These results suggest that the erythrocytes were ruptured by colloid-osmotic shock after CEL-III had formed ion-permeable pores in the membrane.Figure 4:Osmotic protection against hemolysis by various carbohydrates. The hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes was measured in the presence of carbohydrates (15 mM) as indicated. Measurements were performed in duplicate with 5% rabbit erythrocytes and 5 μg/ml CEL-III in TBS containing 10 mM CaCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ATP Release from Erythrocytes Treated with CEL-IIIIn order to confirm the formation of the transmembrane pores by CEL-III, the release of ATP from the erythrocytes treated with CEL-III in the presence of dextran 8 was examined by the firefly luciferase assay (31DeLuca M. McElroy W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 57: 3-15Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, ATP was released from rabbit erythrocytes protected with 15 mM dextran 8 when the cells were incubated with CEL-III, supporting the above idea. The increase in ATP release paralleled the hemolysis measured in the absence of dextran 8 with a slight delay, showing that the formation of ion-permeable pores preceded the hemolysis. In addition to rabbit erythrocytes, ATP release was also detected with human erythrocytes, but not with chicken and horse cells, in agreement with the susceptibility of these cells to the hemolytic action of CEL-III.Figure 5:CEL-III-induced release of ATP from rabbit erythrocytes osmotically protected by dextran 8, and hemolysis in the absence of dextran 8. Rabbit erythrocytes (5%) were incubated with CEL-III (5 μg/ml) in TBS containing 10 mM CaCl2 in the presence (○) or absence (•) of 15 mM dextran 8. The ATP released from the erythrocytes was measured by the firefly luciferase assay(31DeLuca M. McElroy W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 57: 3-15Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The highest values were taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interaction of CEL-III with LiposomesThe interaction of CEL-III with the membrane was further examined by using artificial lipid vesicles as shown in Fig. 6. When CEL-III was added to a solution of carboxyfluorescein-trapping liposomes prepared with egg yolk phosphatidylcholine and a small amount of human globoside (2%, w/w) as a receptor, the fluorescence intensity at 523 nm was enhanced, due to the carboxyfluorescein released from the liposomes. At the same time, a slight turbidity was seen in the solution, due to cross-linking of the liposomes by CEL-III. In contrast, the increase in fluorescence intensity was much smaller both in the solution without the protein and in the presence of 0.1 M lactose. The release of carboxyfluorescein from the liposomes treated with CEL-III was quite slow compared with the hemolysis and ATP release form osmotically protected erythrocytes (Fig. 5).Figure 6:Interaction of CEL-III with the artificial lipid vesicles. CEL-III was incubated with liposomes trapping carboxyfluorescein in TBS containing 10 mM CaCl2 at 20°C in the absence (○) and presence (•) of 0.1 M lactose, and the increase in fluorescence at 523 nm was recorded with excitation at 470 nm. □, blank solution without CEL-III. The fluorescence intensity of the solution after treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONSince galactose- or GalNAc-containing carbohydrates effectively inhibited the hemolysis, it was suggested that CEL-III exerted lytic action by damaging the erythrocyte membrane, after binding to the specific carbohydrates on the cell surface(11Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate this mechanism, the interactions of CEL-III with the erythrocyte membrane and with artificial lipid vesicles were investigated. When lysis of rabbit erythrocytes by CEL-III was measured under different conditions, one of the characteristic features was temperature dependence. The highest activity was exhibited at a low temperature (10°C), suggesting that hemolysis by CEL-III may be a nonenzymatic reaction. Furthermore, the composition of the major lipids in the rabbit erythrocyte membrane, e.g. phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin, did not change after treatment with CEL-III, as confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (data not shown). Therefore, we postulated that hemolysis by CEL-III was caused by formation of transmembrane pores, as with some bacterial and invertebrate hemolysins(12Ryoyama K. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2023697788,"We have cloned two human peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor (PPAR) subtypes, hPPARα and hNUC1. hPPARα is activated by clofibric acid and other PPAR activators. hNUC1 is not activated by these compounds acting instead as a repressor of hPPARα and human thyroid hormone receptor transcriptional activation. Repression is specific since hNUC1 does not significantly repress activation by the progesterone or retinoic acid receptors. We demonstrate co-operative binding of hNUC1 and hRXRα to a PPAR-responsive element and show that in the presence of hRXRα, the affinity of hNUC1 for the peroxisome proliferator is comparable to that of hPPARα. Furthermore, repression of hPPARα can be overcome by transfecting excess hPPARα. We propose that hNUC1 represses the activity of hPPARα by titrating out a factor required for activation.

Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles found in animals and plants, and they contain enzymes for respiration, cholesterol, and lipid metabolism. A variety of chemical agents including hypolipidemic drugs such as clofibrates cause proliferation of peroxisomes in rodents (1Reddy J.K. Azarnoff D.L. Nature. 1980; 283: 397-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses have been put forward to explain the mechanism of peroxisome proliferation.

We are interested in the effect of various fibrates on human PPAR subtypes. We have isolated two human PPAR subtypes hPPARα and hNUC1. While hPPARα is a transcriptional activator in the presence of fibrates and ETYA, hNUC1 is not. However, transfected hNUC1 decreased the response from endogenous PPARs. We therefore reasoned that one function of hNUC1 could be to repress the activity of hPPARα. Accordingly, experiments were performed to determine whether hNUC1 represses hPPARα and other members of the nuclear receptor family. We demonstrate that hNUC1 acts as a repressor of hPPARα and human thyroid hormone receptor activity. ETYA, ATRA, LT3, and CFA were purchased from Sigma, and WY-14,643 from Chemsyn Science Laboratories, Lenexa, KS. Stock solutions of these compounds were made in ethanol or methanol.

A second human PPAR subtype hNUC1 was isolated from a human kidney cDNA library by similarly screening with a probe specific to the rat PPAR DNA binding domain (from the PvuII to the BglII site, nucleotides 618-909) (6Gottlicher M.

Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI, dephosphorylated, and repaired with Klenow enzyme. The TRα1 cDNA was was then joined to the vector by blunt end ligation. The reporter TRE(DR4)2-tk-LUC was made by inserting two copies of an oligonucleotide containing the TRE (DR4) sequence into the pBL-tk-LUC reporter(27Dana S.L. Hoener P.A. Wheeler D.A. Lawrence C.B. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1193-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The sequence of the DR4 oligonucleotide is 5′-GATCTAGGTCACAGGAGGTCACG-3′. HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 2 mML-glutamine, and 55 μg/ml gentamicin (BioWhittaker). Cells were plated at 1.7 × 105 cells/well for HepG2 in 12-well cell culture dishes (Costar). The medium was replaced with fresh medium 20 h later. After 4 h, DNA was added by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (17Berger T.S. Parandosh Z. Perry B. Stein R.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Typically, 0.1 μg of expression plasmid, 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (internal control), and 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid were added to each well. Where indicated, 0-0.5 μg of hNUC1 plasmid (repressor) was added. Repressor plasmid dosage was kept constant by the addition of appropriate amounts of the empty expression vector pBKCMV. The total amount of DNA was kept at 2 μg by the addition of pGEM DNA. After 14 h the cells were washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and fresh medium added (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (HyClone) plus the above supplements). Ligands or PPAR activators were added to the final concentrations indicated. Control cells were treated with vehicle. After another 24 h the cells were harvested, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were quantified on a Dynatech ML 1000 luminometer and a Beckman Biomek 1000 workstation, respectively. The normalized response is the luciferase activity of the extract divided by the β-galactosidase activity of the same. Each data point is the mean of triplicate transfections, and the error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean. Each experiment has been repeated at least three times and a representative experiment is shown in each case. hPPARα and hNUC1 were made by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using 1 μg of pCMVhPPARα or pCMVhNUC1 plasmid DNA and the T3-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The baculovirus/Sf21 cell system was used to express hRXRα(18Allegretto E.A. McClurg M.R. Lazarchik S.B. Clemm D.L. Kerner S.A. Elgort M.G. Boehm M.F. White S. Pike J.W. Heyman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays were performed by incubating 1 μl of in vitro translated hPPARα or hNUC1 and 2 μg of hRXRα in buffer containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.8), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 20% glycerol at 4°C for 5 min. About 12 fmol of 32P-end-labeled probe (approximately 100,000 cpm) were then added and incubated at 25°C for another 5 min. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE. For the competition assays, annealed, unlabeled oligonucleotides were mixed with the labeled probe just before adding to the binding reactions. Oligonucleotides containing the PPRE sequence from the acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) gene used as probe have the sequence 5′-CTAGCGATATCATGACCTTTGTCCTAGGCCTC-3′ (upper strand) and 5′-CTAGGAGGCCTAGGACAAAGGTCATGATATCG-3′ (lower strand). Oligonucleotides with sequences unrelated to the PPRE were used to determine specificity of binding. Their sequences are 5′-CGGGTTAAAAACCGATGTCACATCGGCCGTTCGAA-3′ (upper strand) and 5′-TTTCGAACGGCCGATGTGACATCGGTTTTTAACCC-3′ (lower strand). The activation profile of hPPARα by CFA is shown in Fig. 1A. This receptor is also activated by other known activators of PPARs, e.g. WY-14,643 and ETYA in HepG2 and CV-1 cells (data not shown). A second human PPAR subtype termed hNUC1 was cloned from a kidney cDNA library. This receptor has 61% homology to hPPARα and the two cysteine residues in the “D” box are separated by three amino acids (E, R, and S, positions 112-114 of the amino acid sequence). This is a characteristic of PPARs(5Dreyer C. Krey G. Hansjorg K. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). All the other nuclear receptors have five amino acids in the same region. Therefore, we consider hNUC1 a member of the PPAR family. The hNUC1 receptor, unlike hPPARα is not activated in HepG2 or CV-1 cells by CFA or ETYA (Fig. 1, B and C). The slight activation seen in the absence of transfected receptor is presumably due to the endogenous PPARs in the cell line utilized. Transfected hNUC1 did however decrease the response from the endogenous PPARs. This suggested that hNUC1 may act as a repressor of hPPAR function. Therefore, to demonstrate repression of hPPARα activity by hNUC1, we co-transfected increasing amounts of hNUC1 plasmid with a constant amount of hPPARα expressing plasmid. We saw a strong dose dependent repression of hPPARα activity by hNUC1 (Fig. 2A). Complete repression was observed with 0.1 μg of cotransfected hNUC1 plasmid. Repression by hNUC1 was also observed on rat PPARα and on hPPARα in the presence of ETYA, WY-14,643, and other fibrates (data not shown). To determine whether hNUC1 also represses activation of hPPARα on the natural acyl-CoA oxidase gene promoter, we performed co-transfection assays with the AOX-LUC reporter (Fig. 2B). We observe activation of hPPARα from the AOX promoter in the presence of WY-14,643. Co-transfected hNUC1 completely blocks this activation. No activation was observed by hNUC1 itself in the presence or absence of WY-14,643. We conclude that hNUC1 can repress hPPARα activation through the AOX promoter. We next determined the specificity of hNUC1 repression. We tested the effect of hNUC1 on other members of the steroid receptor family (Fig. 3, A-D). Activation of hTRβ by LT3 through a palindromic TRE was repressed by 65% by hNUC1 (Fig. 3A). Repression increased to 75% in the presence of CFA. However, many TR inducible genes contain TREs that involve direct repeats of the 5′-AGGTCA-3′ motif. We therefore tested whether hNUC1 could also repress activation of hTRβ through a DR4 motif(26Umsono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). We observe repression of TR activation through a DR4 element by hNUC1 in the absence and presence of CFA (Fig. 3B). Repression was also observed with hTRα, although to a lesser degree (data not shown). To determine whether hNUC1 could repress activation of other members of the steroid receptor family, we performed similar assays with the PR and RARα (Fig. 3, C and D). With 0.1 μg of transfected hNUC1 plasmid no repression of PR activity was observed. Similarly with RARα no significant repression by hNUC1 in the absence of CFA was observed. With CFA, 50% repression of RARα activity was observed (Fig. 3D). At higher levels of transfected hNUC1 (0.5 μg) we observe a modest stimulation of activity (Fig. 3, C and D). CFA reduces this induction. However, this stimulation was not observed with hPPARα and 0.5 μg of co-transfected hNUC1 (Fig. 2A). This result indicates that even at high levels of hNUC1, no repression of PR or RARα is observed. Further, hNUC1 did not repress the activity of the estrogen receptor through an estrogen-responsive promoter (data not shown). We conclude that hNUC1 is not a general transcriptional repressor. Among the receptors tested, it strongly repressed activation of hPPARα and hTR. Repression occurred in the absence of clofibric acid, but was enhanced in its presence. One mechanism by which hNUC1 could repress activation by hPPARα is by binding to the PPRE. To demonstrate binding of hNUC1 to a PPRE, we performed gel retardation assays. With hNUC1 or hRXRα alone, very weak retarded complexes are seen (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 4). Addition of RXRα enhances binding of hNUC1 (lane 2) demonstrating cooperative binding of hNUC1 and hRXRα to the PPRE. The specific complex is not observed in control reactions using Sf21 and unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate (lanes 3, 5, and 6), nor with a probe with an unrelated sequence (lane 7). Co-operative binding to the PPRE was also observed between hNUC1 and hRXRα and between hPPARα and hRXRα in gel retardation assays using whole cell extracts from COS cells transfected with the respective expression plasmids (data not shown). These experiments also suggested that transfected hPPARα and hNUC1 were expressed at roughly equal levels as judged by the retarded band intensities. Therefore, to account for the almost complete inhibition of hPPARα induced response at 1:1 ratio of hNUC1 to hPPARα plasmid DNA, the affinity of the hNUC1-RXR complex for the PPRE must be significantly higher than that of hPPARα. Fig. 4B shows the result of a competition experiment using increasing amounts of unlabeled PPRE or probes with unrelated sequences. The hNUC1-RXR-PPRE complex is specific since the unrelated oligonucleotides (lanes 14-18) compete very poorly compared to the specific PPRE containing oligonucleotides (lanes 8-12). It also has a higher mobility than the hPPARα-RXR-PPRE complex. The relative affinity of hNUC1-hRXRα for the PPRE is comparable to that of hPPAR-hRXRα (compare lanes 1-6 with lanes 7-12). Given that the expression levels of hNUC1 and hPPARα in transfected cells and their affinities for the PPRE are similar, competition for PPRE alone cannot wholly account for the strong repression of hPPARα activity by hNUC1. We therefore investigated whether hNUC1 could be titrating a limiting factor required for hPPARα activity. To investigate this possibility, we performed an experiment where we systematically altered the ratio of activator to repressor (Fig. 5). If hNUC1 was indeed titrating out a limiting factor, one would predict from simple equilibrium considerations that increasing the amount of activator (hPPARα) would overcome the repression. We observe that increasing the ratio of hPPARα to hNUC1 overcame the repression by hNUC1. The activation observed with 0.25 and 0.5 μg of hPPARα in the presence of 0.05 μg of hNUC is the same as that observed in the absence of hNUC. Therefore, at sufficiently high ratios of activator to repressor (5- and 10-fold), repression by hNUC was completely overcome. This data is consistent with the hypothesis that hNUC represses hPPARα by titrating a limiting factor required for hPPARα activation. We cannot rigorously rule out the possibility of competitive DNA binding by hNUC1. This is however unlikely since hNUC1 and hPPARα have similar affinities for the PPRE in presence of excess RXR (Fig. 4). This factor is probably not utilized by all receptors since hNUC1 does not have a pronounced repressive effect on the PR and RAR. We have cloned a subtype of the human PPAR family, hNUC1. The sequence of our clone is similar to the previously published sequence (8Schmidt A. Endo N. Rutledge S.J. Vogel R. Shinar D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) except for alanine at position 292 of the amino acid sequence instead of proline. Among the Xenopus PPAR subtypes, xPPARβ has the closest homology to hNUC1. It is possible that hNUC1 is the human homolog of xPPARβ. Although hNUC1 is a member of the PPAR family, we have shown that hNUC1 is not transcriptionally activated by compounds that normally activate hPPARα through the PPRE identified in the acyl-coenzyme A oxidase gene. This has also been observed by Schmidt et al.(8Schmidt A. Endo N. Rutledge S.J. Vogel R. Shinar D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) with hNUC1 and certain fatty acids. We further demonstrate that hNUC1 is a dominant negative repressor of hPPARα and hTR. Several mechanisms of repression can be suggested. First, the mechanism of repression by hNUC1 could be similar to the repression of thyroid hormone action by the non-hormone binding rat erbA-α2(19Koenig R.J. Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Brent G.A. Larsen P.R. Chin W.W. Moore D.D. Nature. 1989; 337: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, Schmidt et al.(8Schmidt A. Endo N. Rutledge S.J. Vogel R. Shinar D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a chimera of the N terminus including the DNA binding domain of the GR fused to the ligand binding domain of hNUC1 (GR-NUC) was activated by WY-14,643. This suggests that hNUC1 can bind the as yet unidentified “ligand” for PPAR. Interestingly, a similar estrogen receptor-NUC chimera was not activated by WY-14,643. This suggests that there is probably no WY-14,643 inducible transcriptional activation function in the ligand binding domain of hNUC1 and further that the activation observed with the GR-NUC chimera was from the strong activation function in the N terminus of the GR(20Godowski P.J. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Secondly, hNUC1 could be binding to the PPRE thereby antagonizing activation of hPPARα. COUP-TF has been shown to inhibit PPAR activation by a similar mechanism(22Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19169-19172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated cooperative binding of hNUC1 and hRXRα to a PPRE. In the absence of a CFA inducible transcription activation function of hNUC1, this mechanism could explain the repression of hPPARα activity by hNUC1. However, since the affinity of the hNUC1-RXR complex for the PPRE is comparable to that of hPPARα-RXR, this cannot wholly explain the strong repression observed with hNUC1. Finally we show that repression by hNUC1 can be reversed by excess transfected hPPARα. This suggests competition for a limiting factor required for transcriptional activity of hPPARα. How hNUC1 represses TR activity is not clear at present. One possibility is the formation of transcriptionally inactive heterodimers as in the case of helix loop helix proteins(23Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization between rPPAR and TR has recently been demonstrated(24Bogazzi F. Hudson L.D. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11683-11686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of CFA on hNUC1-mediated repression is also unclear at present. This is the first demonstration of repression by one PPAR subtype on another and on TR. Our data and that of others (25Hertz R. Kalderon B. Bar-Tana J. Biochemie (Paris). 1993; 75: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) suggest a convergence of the thyroid hormone- and peroxisome- mediated fatty acid metabolism pathways. Overcoming repression by hNUC1 may be a way to increase activity of PPARs and thyroid hormone receptors. We acknowledge the contribution of Dan Noonan in the cloning of hNUC1.

INTRODUCTIONThe majority of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial preproteins are synthesized with amino-terminal presequences that are characterized by a prevalence of positively charged amino acid residues and the potential to form an amphipathic α-helix. The presequences direct translocation of the polypeptide chains into or across the mitochondrial inner membrane (“matrix targeting sequence”) and are cleaved off by the processing peptidase in the matrix (Douglas et al., 1986; Hartl et al., 1989; Horwich, 1990; Baker and Schatz, 1991; Pfanner et al., 1994). Nearly all these cleavable preproteins analyzed so far require receptor proteins on the outer membrane surface and the heat shock protein hsp70 in the matrix (mt-hsp70) 1The abbreviations used are: mt-hsp70mitochondrial matrix heat shock protein of 70 kDa (also termed Ssc1p)COXVacytochrome c oxidase subunit VaΔψmembrane potentialMOM19MOM72, mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (import receptors) of about 19 and 72 kDa, respectively (also termed MAS20 and MAS70, respectively)MPPmitochondrial processing peptidaseSu9-DHFRfusion protein between the presequence of F0-ATPase subunit 9 and dihydrofolate reductaseMSMmembrane sorting machineryBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneDiSC3(5)3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. for import into mitochondria.Initial characterization of the biogenesis of subunit Va of cytochrome c oxidase (COXVa) suggested an exceptional behavior. Import of COXVa (i) was not inhibited by pretreatment of mitochondria with a protease known to degrade the surface receptors (Miller and Cumsky, 1991) and (ii) was not inhibited by a mutation in mt-hsp70 (Miller and Cumsky, 1993). COXVa appears to follow a novel targeting and sorting pathway into the mitochondrial inner membrane. However, alternative possibilities to explain the surprising results obtained with the import of COXVa are as follows. (i) The treatment of isolated mitochondria with protease not only removes the surface receptors MOM19 (MAS20) and MOM72 (MAS70), but may open cryptic import sites that allow non-physiological import of certain preproteins. Therefore, an import inhibition by removal of the surface receptors may be partially or completely reversed. To exclude this possibility, a selective removal of surface receptors is needed. (ii) The import of COXVa was not affected by a mutation in mt-hsp70 that inhibits import of other mitochondrial preproteins (Kang et al., 1990; Miller and Cumsky, 1993). A recent analysis assigned two distinct functions to mt-hsp70 in import of preproteins, facilitation of unfolding of preproteins during translocation (unfoldase function), and actual translocation across the inner membrane independently of the folding state of preproteins (translocase function) (Gambill et al., 1993; Voos et al., 1993). As the mutant mitochondria used were found to be solely defective in the unfoldase function (Gambill et al., 1993), it cannot be excluded that import of COXVa depends on the translocase function of mt-hsp70.Here we tried to answer these questions about the import pathway of COXVa and to set its import into context with the general mitochondrial import pathway. To circumvent possible limitations of a biochemical analysis of the role of import receptors, we studied the biogenesis of COXVa with Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants selectively lacking either MOM19 or MOM72 (Moczko et al., 1994). Moreover, we analyzed COXVa import in a temperature-sensitive S. cerevisiae strain defective in the translocase function of mt-hsp70 (Gambill et al., 1993). We show that import of COXVa (i) is indeed independent of the receptor functions of MOM19 or MOM72, but (ii) strictly requires the translocase function of mt-hsp70. A comparison of COXVa import with the general mitochondrial import pathway leads to important implications on the characterization of receptor mutants and the mechanisms of inner membrane protein sorting.MATERIALS AND METHODSS. cerevisiae StrainsConstruction of the receptor mutants ΔMOM19 and ΔMOM72 by gene disruption as well as of the temperature-sensitive mt-hsp70 mutants ssc1-2 and ssc1-3 has been described previously (Moczko et al., 1994; Gambill et al., 1993). The haploid yeast strains of the mutants and their corresponding wild types are indicated in Table 1.Table I Open table in a new tab Protein Import into Isolated Yeast MitochondriaThe S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YP medium (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone) containing 2% glucose (receptor mutants) or 3% glycerol (mt-hsp70 mutants), and mitochondria were isolated according to published procedures (Daum et al., 1982; Hartl et al., 1987; Kang et al., 1990; Gambill et al., 1993). Mitochondrial precursor proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine as described (Söllner et al., 1991). COXVa constructs lacked the amino acid residues 101-118 (COXVaΔ101-118; Glaser et al., 1990) or 26-89 (COXVaΔ26-89) 2A. Querol, B. R. Miller and M. G. Cumsky, unpublished data. of the COXVa precursor. The standard import assays included isolated yeast mitochondria (50 μg of protein), radiolabeled precursor (5 μl of reticulocyte lysate), 2 mM Mg-ATP, and 2 mM NADH in bovine serum albumin (BSA)-containing buffer (Söllner et al., 1991) at a final volume of 0.1 ml. The reactions were incubated for 3-5 min at 25°C (within the kinetically linear range) and stopped with 1 μM valinomycin. Dissipation of the membrane potential Δψ was achieved by adding 1 μM valinomycin and 20 μM oligomycin prior to incubation. Published procedures (Söllner et al., 1991) were used for proteinase K treatment, reisolation of the mitochondria, separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), densitometric analysis of fluorograms, or storage phosphorimaging analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) of autoradiograms.Assessment of the Mitochondrial Inner Membrane Potential ΔψThe membrane potential Δψ of isolated yeast mitochondria was assessed using the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5); Molecular Probes, Inc.). The method is based on the potential-dependent partitioning of the dye between mitochondria and the medium, leading to a decrease in fluorescence (“quenching”) with increasing Δψ (Sims et al., 1974). The measurements were performed with a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer at 25°C, excitation at 622 nm, emission at 670 nm, slits 5 nm. Successively, the following reagents were added to a cuvette and the fluorescence changes registered in arbitrary units: 3 ml of buffer (0.6 M sorbitol, 0.1% BSA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 20 mM KPi, pH 7.4), 3 μl of DiSC3(5) (in Me2SO; 2 μM final concentration), 20 μl of mitochondria in SEM buffer (250 mM saccharose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.2; 33 μg/ml protein final concentration), and finally 3 μl of KCN (1 mM final concentration) + 3 μl of valinomycin (in ethanol; 1 μM final concentration) to dissipate Δψ. The difference between the fluorescence prior to and after addition of KCN/valinomycin represents a relative assessment of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The isolated mitochondria of wild-type and mutant cells apparently contained sufficient internal substrates as the inclusion of external substrates (2 mM NADH plus 2 mM ATP, or 5 mM succinate plus 5 mM malate) did not lead to further increase of fluorescence quenching.CCCP TitrationFor gradually reducing the membrane potential by stepwise uncoupling, increasing concentrations of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; Sigma; from a 100-fold concentrated stock solution in ethanol) were included in the import reactions (Martin et al., 1991). In order to prevent a decrease of ATP levels and generation of an electrochemical potential by a reversed action of the F0F1-ATPase, 20 μM oligomycin was present in the assay.RESULTSImport of COXVa Is Not Affected in ΔMOM72 Mitochondria but Is Moderately Reduced in ΔMOM19 MitochondriaThe precursor of COXVa was synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with energized isolated S. cerevisiae mitochondria in the kinetically linear import range. To assess the import of COXVa, the mitochondria were then treated with protease, reisolated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Import of COXVa into mitochondria from a strain lacking MOM72 was analyzed. The import occurred with comparable efficiency into ΔMOM72 and wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 1A, columns1 and 2). As controls for the specific effect of the deletion of MOM72, we show that import of the non-cleavable preprotein ADP/ATP carrier is inhibited (Fig. 1A, column4), while the import of cleavable preproteins is slightly or not inhibited (Moczko et al., 1993, 1994). Cleavable preproteins used were the α-subunit of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (α-MPP) and a fusion protein between the presequence of F0-ATPase subunit 9 and dihydrofolate reductase (Su9-DHFR) (Fig. 1A, columns6 and 8).The import of COXVa into ΔMOM19 mitochondria, however, was moderately reduced to about two-thirds of the import efficiency into wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 1B, lanes1 and 2). The reduction was significant as determined from the standard error of the means of several independent experiments (Table 2). The import of preproteins such as α-MPP and Su9-DHFR, which are known to be imported via MOM19 (Moczko et al., 1993), was more strongly inhibited by a deletion of MOM19 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3-6; Table 2).Table II Open table in a new tab The Reduction of COXVa Import into ΔMOM19 Mitochondria Is Due to a Reduction of the Membrane PotentialThe moderate reduction of COXVa import into ΔMOM19 mitochondria could be due to a direct requirement of import for MOM19 or could be caused by an indirect effect of the MOM19 deletion on other steps of the COXVa import pathway. Import of COXVa was shown to require a membrane potential Δψ across the mitochondrial inner membrane (Glaser et al., 1990). By use of the fluorescent dye 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5)), we assessed if ΔMOM19 mitochondria possessed a membrane potential Δψ. The decrease in fluorescence after addition of mitochondria shows that ΔMOM19 mitochondria were able to generate a Δψ (Fig. 2). The fluorescence quenching of ΔMOM19 mitochondria, however, was less than that of wild-type mitochondria, indicating that ΔMOM19 mitochondria possessed a lower membrane potential than wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 2; Table 2). The Δψ reduction was fully reversible when MOM19 was expressed from a plasmid in the ΔMOM19 strain (not shown).Figure 2:Assessment of the membrane potential in mitochondria lacking MOM19. The membrane potential Δψ of isolated ΔMOM19 and wild-type mitochondria was determined by fluorescence photometry with the potential-sensitive dye DiSC3(5) as described under “Materials and Methods.” A pronounced fluorescence quenching (decrease) after addition of the mitochondria (100 μg of protein) compared to the levels obtained with 1 μM valinomycin/1 mM KCN (in order to dissipate the membrane potential) indicates a high Δψ .View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Different preproteins can have different requirements for the magnitude of the membrane potential needed to drive import (Martin et al., 1991). It can be argued that import of COXVa has the same dependence on MOM19 as import of α-MPP and Su9-DHFR and the weaker inhibition of its import into ΔMOM19 mitochondria is just due to a lower Δψ-requirement. To exclude this, we asked how the Δψ-dependence of COXVa import was related to that of α-MPP and Su9-DHFR. Wild-type mitochondria were partially uncoupled by limiting concentrations of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). The higher the CCCP concentration needed for a half-maximal inhibition of import, the lower is the membrane potential needed for import (Martin et al., 1991). COXVa import showed a CCCP inhibition curve similar to that of α-MPP, whereas Su9-DHFR could still be imported at lower membrane potentials (Fig. 3). Therefore, the Δψ-dependence of COXVa is comparable to that of α-MPP and even higher than that of Su9-DHFR. When the import efficiencies of the three preproteins into ΔMOM19 mitochondria were corrected for the reduction of fluorescence quenching, i.e. the relative assessment of the membrane potential, the import of COXVa was of wild-type efficiency (Table 2). As expected, the import of α-MPP and Su9-DHFR was still strongly inhibited, in agreement with a dependence of their import on the receptor function of MOM19 (Table 2).Figure 3:Dependence of COXVa import on the mitochondrial membrane potential. Isolated wild-type mitochondria (50 μg of protein) were suspended in 1% BSA-containing import buffer in the presence of 2 mM ATP, 2 mM NADH, and 20 μM oligomycin and partially uncoupled by adding increasing concentrations of the protonophore CCCP as indicated (see “Materials and Methods”). Then the 35S-labeled precursor proteins COXVa, α-MPP, and Su9-DHFR were imported for 5 min at 25°C, and the reactions were stopped with 1 μM valinomycin. After reisolation and SDS-PAGE separation of the mitochondria, the processed proteins were quantified by densitometry of the fluorograms. Samples receiving no CCCP represented 100% import efficiency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We conclude that the reduction of COXVa import into ΔMOM19 mitochondria is indirectly caused by a reduction of the membrane potential and that the import of COXVa does not require the receptors MOM72 and MOM19. In support of this, antibodies directed against MOM19 or MOM72 (Moczko et al., 1993) did not inhibit import of COXVa into isolated mitochondria (not shown).Import of COXVa Depends on the Translocase Function of mt-hsp70Two temperature-sensitive mutant strains of mt-hsp70 (ssc1-2 and ssc1-3) were used. The phenotypes are induced by shifting the isolated mitochondria to 37°C (Gambill et al., 1993). ssc1-2 mitochondria are defective only in the unfoldase function of mt-hsp70, that is the mutant hsp70 (Ssc1-2p) does not promote unfolding of polypeptide chains during membrane translocation, yet has sufficient binding capacity to drive translocation of an unfolded preprotein into the matrix. Ssc1-3p is unable to bind to precursor polypeptides and therefore is defective in both the unfoldase function and the translocase function (Voos et al., 1993).In agreement with a previous report (Miller and Cumsky, 1993), import of COXVa into ssc1-2 mitochondria was not inhibited (Fig. 4, lanes4 and 10). However, import into ssc1-3 mitochondria was blocked (Fig. 4, lanes6 and 12). Proteolytic processing of the presequence was also inhibited with ssc1-3 mitochondria (Fig. 4, lane6), indicating that binding to mt-hsp70 is needed to drive COXVa deep enough into mitochondria to expose the cleavage site to the matrix processing peptidase. To exclude unspecific inhibitory effects of the ssc1-3 mitochondria on Δψ-dependent translocation or on processing of preproteins, we analyzed the import of a special test protein, a fusion between the 167 amino-terminal amino acid residues of the precursor of cytochrome b2 and entire dihydrofolate reductase (b2-DHFR). This fusion protein has been shown to be imported independently of functional mt-hsp70. The presequence of cytochrome b2 is bipartite. A typical matrix targeting sequence in the first half of the presequence is followed by a second sorting sequence which includes a hydrophobic core and is required for directing transport of cytochrome b2 to the intermembrane space. A hypothetical sorting component is assumed to bind to the sorting sequence and to substitute for the translocase function of mt-hsp70 (Voos et al., 1993; Glick et al., 1993; Stuart et al., 1994). Unfolding of b2-DHFR in the in vitro system seems to need only low energy inputs, not requiring the unfoldase function of mt-hsp70 (Voos et al., 1993). The import of b2-DHFR into ssc1-2 and ssc1-3 mitochondrial preparations used in this study was not affected (Fig. 4), demonstrating the import capabilities of the mutant mitochondria as long as functional mt-hsp70 is not required. We conclude therefore that import of COXVa requires the translocase function of mt-hsp70.Figure 4:Import of COXVa into ssc1-3 mitochondria is strongly inhibited. Mitochondria from wild-type yeast and from the temperature-sensitive mt-hsp70 mutants ssc1-2 and ssc1-3 (50 μg of protein) were shifted to 37°C for 10 min in order to stably induce their phenotypes (Gambill et al., 1993). 1 μM valinomycin and 20 μM oligomycin dissipated the membrane potential where indicated. Then the import of radiolabeled COXVa precursor protein and of a fusion protein between the 167 amino-terminal residues of the cytochrome b2 precursor and entire dihydrofolate reductase (b2-DHFR) into the energized mitochondria was performed for 3 min at 25°C and stopped by addition of 1 μM valinomycin. One half of each sample was treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K. The mitochondria were reisolated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by fluorography and densitometry. The amount of mature-sized protein in wild-type mitochondria was set to 100%. The faint protease-sensitive band below mature COXVa (and COXVaΔ101-118 in Fig. 5) is already present in the reticulocyte lysate and is probably due to internal initiation of translation (Hartl et al., 1987). p, precursor; m, mature protein; Δψ, membrane potential.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Requirement for the Translocase Function of mt-hsp70 Is Determined by the Position of the Sorting Sequence within COXVaTo analyze which properties of the precursor protein determine the dependence of COXVa import on the translocase function of mt-hsp70, we tested the import of several COXVa constructs into ssc1 mutant mitochondria.COXVa contains a hydrophobic segment in its carboxyl-terminal portion (residues 98-119) that is required for directing the polypeptide into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Glaser et al., 1990). A COXVa construct lacking most of this inner membrane sorting sequence (COXVaΔ101-118) was imported into the matrix (Glaser et al., 1990). COXVaΔ101-118 showed the same dependence on the functions of mt-hsp70 as wild-type COXVa, i.e. import of COXVaΔ101-118 into ssc1-2 mitochondria was not significantly affected (Fig. 5, lanes4 and 10), while import into ssc1-3 mitochondria was inhibited (Fig. 5, lanes6 and 12). Therefore, deletion of the sorting sequence does not influence the dependence of COXVa import on the translocase function of mt-hsp70.Figure 5:COXVa with a deletion of the internal sorting signal is inhibited in import into ssc1-3 mitochondria. The experiment was performed essentially as described in the legend of Fig. 4 with the exception that a COXVa construct carrying a deletion of amino acid residues 101-118 was employed. p, precursor; m, mature protein; Δψ, membrane potential.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We then employed a construct where a major portion of the sequence between the COXVa presequence (first 20 residues) and the hydrophobic sorting signal was removed. In this construct (COXVaΔ26-89) the sorting signal was placed close to the presequence such that the matrix targeting signal and the sorting signal were contained within the first 60 amino acid residues of the preprotein. The close vicinity of the two distinct signals resembles the situation of bipartite presequences of, for example, cytochrome b2. The construct COXVaΔ26-89 was imported into isolated wild-type yeast mitochondria in a Δψ-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). To test if COXVaΔ26-89 was correctly inserted into the mitochondrial inner membrane, we employed a specific assay developed for authentic COXVa (Miller and Cumsky, 1991, 1993). After opening of the intermembrane space by swelling of the mitochondria and addition of proteinase K, only correctly localized COXVa gives rise to a fragment that is about 3 kDa smaller than COXVa. The fragmentation indicates removal of the carboxyl-terminal tail of COXVa behind the hydrophobic sorting and membrane anchor sequence (Miller and Cumsky, 1991, 1993). Fig. 6B (lane2) shows that this typical fragment was also formed from imported COXVaΔ26-89. Probably due to the modification of COXVa close to the cleavage site of the matrix processing peptidase, removal of the amino-terminal presequence from the construct was slow and was thus not observed in the short import times used here (the short import times are necessary to be in the kinetically linear range for membrane translocation). At longer incubation times in the import reaction, the expected proteolytic processing took place (not shown).Figure 6:Placement of the sorting signal close to the presequence renders import of COXVa independent of functional mt-hsp70. A, import of COXVaΔ26-89 into the ssc1-mutant mitochondria. A COXVa construct lacking amino acid residues 26-89 was imported into wild-type, ssc1-2 and ssc1-3 mitochondria as described in the legend of Fig. 4. All samples were treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K. Imported COXVaΔ26-89 (precursor form) is indicated by an arrow. Δψ, membrane potential. B, characteristic fragmentation of correctly imported COXVaΔ26-89. The COXVa construct was imported as mentioned above. After reisolating, the mitochondria in one half of each sample were converted to mitoplasts by swelling in 25 mM saccharose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.2 (Blom et al., 1993), reisolated again, and incubated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K in BSA-containing import buffer. The mitochondria were collected by centrifugation and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteolytic fragment formed by proteinase K is indicated by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)COXVaΔ26-89 was also efficiently imported to a protease-protected location in ssc1-2 and ssc1-3 mitochondria (Fig. 6A, lanes4 and 6). The import was inhibited by dissipation of the membrane potential Δψ (Fig. 6A, lanes3 and 5). The insertion of COXVaΔ26-89 into the mitochondrial inner membrane, assessed by formation of the proteolytic fragment, was indistinguishable among wild-type, ssc1-2, and ssc1-3 mitochondria (Fig. 6B, lanes2, 4, and 6). The import behavior of COXVaΔ26-89 into ssc1-3 mitochondria is thus in strict contrast to that of authentic COXVa and COXVaΔ101-118.DISCUSSIONS. cerevisiae mutants represent a powerful system to study intracellular protein sorting. Here we have characterized the unusual mitochondrial import pathway of cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va with yeast mutants defective in distinct import components. Our findings suggest a refined model of COXVa import and provide new insights into the properties of import receptor mutants and the mechanisms of membrane translocation driven by matrix hsp70.Independence of COXVa Import from the Import Receptors MOM19 and MOM72Import of COXVa into ΔMOM72 mitochondria was of the same efficiency as that into wild-type mitochondria, demonstrating that MOM72 is not required for import of this preprotein. However, the import of COXVa was moderately yet significantly reduced with ΔMOM19 mitochondria. This finding was unexpected, inasmuch as a removal of surface receptors by protease did not reduce COXVa import (Miller and Cumsky, 1991), raising the possibility of opening cryptic import sites by the protease treatment. Alternatively, a deletion of MOM19 may affect further import steps, which are not directly linked to receptor function but which require components imported via MOM19. Evidence for the second possibility was provided by the observation that the membrane potential across the inner membrane of ΔMOM19 mitochondria was moderately reduced. The reduced import of COXVa correlated with the reduced membrane potential, whereas the import of other presequence-carrying preproteins into ΔMOM19 mitochondria was more strongly inhibited. After correction of the import efficiencies for the reduction of Δψ, import of COXVa was of wild-type efficiency, whereas import of the other cleavable preproteins was of the level observed for an inactivation of surface receptors by other means (inhibitory antibodies and proteases) (Söllner et al., 1989; Moczko et al., 1993). While each of the three approaches to inactivate mitochondrial surface receptors (protease treatment, inhibitory antibodies, and deletion mutants) has its potential pitfalls, the full agreement of the results obtained with the different approaches provides convincing evidence. We conclude that import of COXVa does not require the two known surface receptors MOM19 and MOM72.Now three mitochondrial preproteins are known that depend upon neither MOM19 nor MOM72 for import. (i) Apocytochrome c seems to be translocated through the lipids of the outer membrane and is trapped in the intermembrane space by covalent attachment of heme mediated by cytochrome c heme lyase (Nicholson et al., 1988; Dumont et al., 1991; Jordi et al., 1992). (ii) The precursor of MOM19 is imported into the receptor complex of the outer membrane without a need for mature MOM19 or MOM72, but directly and stably assembles with MOM38 (ISP42), the major component of the general insertion pore in the receptor complex (Schneider et al., 1991). (iii) COXVa seems to use yet another mechanism for translocation across the outer membrane. To date, COXVa is the only presequence-carrying preprotein that requires neither MOM19 nor MOM72. The presequence of COXVa is positively charged, but is not predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix found with typical mitochondrial presequences, which have positive charges clustered on one side of a helix and hydrophobic residues clustered on the other side (Roise et al., 1986; von Heijne, 1986). Recent studies reinforced the importance of an amphipathic α-helix for targeting of preproteins via MOM19 (Brink et al., 1994). Other positively charged sequences were shown to mediate a receptor-independent and low efficient “bypass” import into mitochondria, which seems to be mediated by the general insertion pore of the receptor complex (Baker and Schatz, 1987; Pfaller et al., 1989). Typical mitochondrial preproteins are also able to use this bypass for a small fraction of their import in addition to the much more efficient receptor-mediated import (Pfaller et al., 1989). The efficiency of COXVa import is far above that observed for bypass import. We speculate that the precursor of COXVa possesses a special ability for direct insertion into and translocation through the general insertion pore of the outer membrane and thus is imported without a need for surface receptors.Implications for Characterization of Import Receptor MutantsMitochondria depleted of MOM19 are currently used widely to characterize the functions of mitochondrial import receptors (Ramage et al., 1993; Harkness et al., 1994; Lithgow et al., 1994; Moczko et al., 1994). The finding reported here has important implications for the interpretation of these results, as it demonstrates a reduction of the membrane potential in ΔMOM19 mitochondria. The reduction varies between different batches of mitochondria and mutant strains, but in each case correlates with the reduction of COXVa import. 3F. Gärtner and N. Pfanner, unpublished. We conclude that the membrane potential of ΔMOM19 mitochondria must be assessed before interpretation of import inhibition results. A comparison of the results obtained with the three different approaches of inactivation of surface receptors indicates that 70-85% of import of a typical presequence-carrying preprotein occurs via MOM19 (Pfaller et al., 1989; Söllner et al., 1989; Steger et al., 1990; Moczko et al., 1993, 1994; this study). Stronger import inhibitions into ΔMOM19 mitochondria (Harkness et al., 1994; Lithgow et al., 1994) may be caused by a reduction of Δψ. Harkness et al.(1994) reported that their mitochondria depleted of MOM19 were deficient in cristae membranes and cytochromes, suggesting that inner membrane functions such as generation of Δψ may be affected. Studies with the control protein mostly used so far, the ADP/ATP carrier, can be misleading as this preprotein can be imported at considerably lower membrane potentials than most cleavable preproteins (Pfanner and Neupert, 1985; Martin et al., 1991). We recommend to use the import of COXVa as internal standard for the quality of ΔMOM19 mitochondria, as we found that COXVa has a Δψ-dependence comparable to that of typical presequence-carrying preproteins, but not the dependence on MOM19.Dependence of COXVa Import on Matrix hsp70While previous work suggested that COXVa import was independent of the molecular chaperones hsp70 and hsp60 in the matrix, we found a strong dependence of import on the translocase function of mt-hsp70. In the original temperature-sensitive mutant of mt-hsp70, the chaperone exhibits a residual binding activity for preproteins and thus is able to import loosely folded preproteins (Kang et al., 1990; Gambill et al., 1993; Voos et al., 1993). The precursor of COXVa synthesized in vitro seems to be loosely folded (Miller and Cumsky, 1991, 1993) and does not require the unfoldase function of mt-hsp70. In another temperature-sensitive mutant (ssc1-3), mt-hsp70 is unable to bind to precursor polypeptides, and therefore translocation of preproteins across the inner membrane is blocked even if they are unfolded (Gambill et al., 1993). COXVa was strongly inhibited in import into these mutant mitochondria, indicating that it requires the translocase function of mt-hsp70. Removal of the presequence of COXVa was blocked in the ssc1-3 mitochondria, demonstrating that the presequence is not transported deep enough into the matrix to allow access of the processing peptidase (the activity of the processing peptidase is not affected by the ssc1-3 mutation (Gambill et al., 1993; Voos et al., 1993)). Moreover, no accumulation of uncleaved protease-protected COXVa was observed in the mutant mitochondria, even after prolonged incubation times,3 indicating a requirement for the translocase function of mt-hsp70 also at the outer membrane level. Therefore, the translocase function of mt-hsp70 appears to be essential for both transfer of COXVa across the outer membrane and into the inner membrane.Requirement for the Translocase Function of mt-hsp70 Is Influenced by the Position of the Hydrophobic Sorting SequenceCOXVa contains a 20-residue presequence (matrix targeting sequence) and a hydrophobic sequence in the carboxyl-terminal half, which functions as an inner membrane sorting and membrane anchor sequence (Glaser et al., 1990). Some preproteins targeted to the intermembrane space or the outer side of the inner membrane such as cytochrome b2 and cytochrome c1 also contain a matrix targeting sequence and a sorting sequence with a hydrophobic core. In these preproteins both signal sequences are located within a bipartite presequence. The import of cytochrome b2, and possibly cytochrome c1, was found to be independent of the translocase function of mt-hsp70 (Voos et al., 1993; Glick et al., 1992). In case of cytochrome b2, the sorting sequence in the second half of the presequence is responsible for independence from the translocase function (Voos et al., 1993). It is assumed that an unidentified component of the inner membrane sorting machinery specifically binds to the sorting sequence and supports translocation of the precursor polypeptide. Thus, the sorting machinery substitutes for the translocase function of mt-hsp70 and allows processing and full import of fusion proteins containing the presequence of cytochrome b2 into ssc1-3 mitochondria (Voos et al., 1993). We wondered if the sorting sequence of COXVa may play roles in import similar to that of the sorting sequences in the bipartite presequences. Therefore, we moved the sorting sequence of COXVa closer to the presequence to mimic the spatial situation found in bipartite presequences (we previously showed that the length of a preprotein does not influence the dependence on the translocase function (Voos et al., 1993)). This construct was efficiently imported by mitochondria defective in the translocase function of mt-hsp70 and was correctly inserted into the inner membrane, demonstrating that the dependence of COXVa import on mt-hsp70 can be completely changed by changing the intramolecular position of the hydrophobic sorting sequence.We propose the following model for the inner membrane translocation of preproteins containing a matrix targeting sequence and a hydrophobic sorting sequence (Fig. 7A). The polypeptides are translocated as linear chains. The membrane potential Δψ is required to drive translocation of the amino-terminal presequence across the inner membrane but is usually not sufficient to transport the presequence deep enough into the matrix to allow proteolytic cleavage. mt-hsp70 binds to the preprotein segments emerging on the matrix side and thereby promotes translocation of the complete presequence and of mature portions of the preprotein. A component of the inner membrane sorting machinery (MSM) selectively binds to the sorting sequence to direct it into the inner membrane. Binding of the sorting component can fully substitute for the translocase function of mt-hsp70 when the sorting signal is close to the presequence (Fig. 7C). That is, the initial Δψ-driven translocation must bring the sorting sequence close enough to the inner membrane sorting machinery such that it can be recognized and bound. It is unknown what drives the proposed translocase function of the sorting machinery, which is able to function at very low ATP levels (Glick et al., 1993; Stuart et al., 1994). Possibly, the energy for driving import is derived from binding of the sorting sequence to the sorting machinery and its subsequent stable insertion into the lipid phase. In case the sorting sequence is too far away from the presequence, the Δψ-driven import of the linear polypeptide chain is not sufficient to promote movement of the sorting signal toward the sorting machinery (Fig. 7B), and therefore mt-hsp70 with its broad reactivity for unfolded segments is essential to drive translocation by binding to preprotein segments located closer to the presequence.Figure 7:Hypothetical model about the role of matrix hsp70 and the inner membrane sorting machinery in import of preproteins with dual targeting information. A, the model shows import of COXVa into the mitochondrial inner membrane driven by a stepwise action of the membrane potential Δψ on the presequence (positively charged box), binding of mt-hsp70 molecules to unfolded preprotein segments, and binding of the mitochondrial inner membrane sorting machinery to the hydrophobic sorting sequence (hatchedbox). B, when a mutated mt-hsp70 is unable to bind to preproteins, MSM is not able to bind to the preprotein as the distance to the sorting sequence is too large. Translocation is blocked. C, when the sorting sequence is moved close to the presequence, the Δψ -driven translocation transports the sorting sequence close enough to MSM such that binding is possible also in the absence of functional mt-hsp70. Binding to MSM can now substitute for the translocase function of mt-hsp70.

A substitution of MSM for the translocase function of mt-hsp70 may also be possible when MSM is located on the matrix side of the inner membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) INTRODUCTIONThe majority of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial preproteins are synthesized with amino-terminal presequences that are characterized by a prevalence of positively charged amino acid residues and the potential to form an amphipathic α-helix. The presequences direct translocation of the polypeptide chains into or across the mitochondrial inner membrane (“matrix targeting sequence”) and are cleaved off by the processing peptidase in the matrix (Douglas et al., 1986; Hartl et al., 1989; Horwich, 1990; Baker and Schatz, 1991; Pfanner et al., 1994). Nearly all these cleavable preproteins analyzed so far require receptor proteins on the outer membrane surface and the heat shock protein hsp70 in the matrix (mt-hsp70) 1The abbreviations used are: mt-hsp70mitochondrial matrix heat shock protein of 70 kDa (also termed Ssc1p)COXVacytochrome c oxidase subunit VaΔψmembrane potentialMOM19MOM72, mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (import receptors) of about 19 and 72 kDa, respectively (also termed MAS20 and MAS70, respectively)MPPmitochondrial processing peptidaseSu9-DHFRfusion protein between the presequence of F0-ATPase subunit 9 and dihydrofolate reductaseMSMmembrane sorting machineryBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneDiSC3(5)3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. for import into mitochondria.Initial characterization of the biogenesis of subunit Va of cytochrome c oxidase (COXVa) suggested an exceptional behavior. Import of COXVa (i) was not inhibited by pretreatment of mitochondria with a protease known to degrade the surface receptors (Miller and Cumsky, 1991) and (ii) was not inhibited by a mutation in mt-hsp70 (Miller and Cumsky, 1993). COXVa appears to follow a novel targeting and sorting pathway into the mitochondrial inner membrane. However, alternative possibilities to explain the surprising results obtained with the import of COXVa are as follows. (i) The treatment of isolated mitochondria with protease not only removes the surface receptors MOM19 (MAS20) and MOM72 (MAS70), but may open cryptic import sites that allow non-physiological import of certain preproteins. Therefore, an import inhibition by removal of the surface receptors may be partially or completely reversed. To exclude this possibility, a selective removal of surface receptors is needed. (ii) The import of COXVa was not affected by a mutation in mt-hsp70 that inhibits import of other mitochondrial preproteins (Kang et al., 1990; Miller and Cumsky, 1993). A recent analysis assigned two distinct functions to mt-hsp70 in import of preproteins, facilitation of unfolding of preproteins during translocation (unfoldase function), and actual translocation across the inner membrane independently of the folding state of preproteins (translocase function) (Gambill et al., 1993; Voos et al., 1993). As the mutant mitochondria used were found to be solely defective in the unfoldase function (Gambill et al., 1993), it cannot be excluded that import of COXVa depends on the translocase function of mt-hsp70.Here we tried to answer these questions about the import pathway of COXVa and to set its import into context with the general mitochondrial import pathway. To circumvent possible limitations of a biochemical analysis of the role of import receptors, we studied the biogenesis of COXVa with Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants selectively lacking either MOM19 or MOM72 (Moczko et al., 1994). Moreover, we analyzed COXVa import in a temperature-sensitive S. cerevisiae strain defective in the translocase function of mt-hsp70 (Gambill et al., 1993). We show that import of COXVa (i) is indeed independent of the receptor functions of MOM19 or MOM72, but (ii) strictly requires the translocase function of mt-hsp70. A comparison of COXVa import with the general mitochondrial import pathway leads to important implications on the characterization of receptor mutants and the mechanisms of inner membrane protein sorting."

Transient transfection in pinealocyte cultures and PC12 cells was used to investigate the human TPH (hTPH) gene promoter activity and its regulation by the cAMP signaling pathway. A region of 2,117 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site of the hTPH gene efficiently directed the transcription of a luciferase reporter gene but not in a cell-specific manner. The hTPH promoter activity was significantly enhanced by a cyclic AMP analog in the two cell types. Deletion analysis showed that the promoter region from −73 to +2 is sufficient to direct cAMP-dependent transcription, although it does not contain a motif exhibiting a significant identity to the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) or AP-2 binding site. Following site-directed mutagenesis of the region between −73 and −51, an inverted CCAAT box motif was identified as essential for cAMP inducibility of the hTPH promoter. This sequence between −73 and −51 alone allowed cAMP enhancement of transcription when fused to a heterologous promoter. Additionally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that a specific protein-DNA complex is formed between an oligonucleotide corresponding to the inverted CCAAT box motif and nuclear proteins from pinealocytes treated or not treated with cAMP. Thus cAMP responsiveness of hTPH gene expression is mediated by a cis-acting element, which shares strong identitiy with an inverted CCAAT box and which binds to a constitutively produced nuclear factor.

In the central nervous system, TPH is mainly expressed in the brainstem raphe nuclei, where the corresponding neurons project onto almost every region of the brain in a highly divergent manner(1Lovenberg W. Jequier E. Sjoerdsma A. Science. 1967; 155: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Serotonin has been shown to modulate numerous basal brain functions including sleep, thirst, hunger, reproduction, arousal, and awakeness (2Blundell J.E. Neuropharmacology. 1984; 23: 1537-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 3Jacobs B.L. Azmitia E.C. Physiol. Ref. 1992; 72: 165-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). The synthesis and activity of the TPH enzyme, therefore, has to be tuned to very different physiological situations. It has been shown that glucocorticoids and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase are able to increase TPH activity (4Sze P.Y. Neckers L. Towle A.C. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 169-173PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ehret M.

The pineal gland also contains large amounts of TPH. Serotonin is the metabolic precursor of melatonin(1Lovenberg W. Jequier E. Sjoerdsma A. Science. 1967; 155: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), which is the main neurohormone produced and secreted in a circadian manner by the pineal gland(7Quay W.B. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1963; 3: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 8Lerner A.B. Case J.D. Heinzelmann R.V. J. Am. Chem.

This daily fluctuation depends upon the activity of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, from which regulatory signals are transmitted to the pineal gland by the sympathetic fibers of the cervical superior ganglion(10Reiter R.J. Hester R.J. Endocrinology. 1966; 79: 1168-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Released noradrenaline activates β-adrenergic receptors, which stimulate adenylate cyclase(11Mikuni M. Saito Y. Koyama T. Yamashita I. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 1295-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), thereby activating cAMP-dependent gene transcription. Although TPH is not believed to be the rate-limiting component of melatonin synthesis in the pineal gland, its activity and mRNA level are also subject to a circadian rhythm (12Shibuya H. Toru M. Watanabe S. Brain Res. 1978; 138: 364-368Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Ehret M. Pevet P. Maitre M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Hart R.P. Yang R. Riley L.A. Green T.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1991; 2: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Elevated concentrations of intracellular cAMP have also been reported to increase TPH synthesis in the pineal gland(13Ehret M. Pevet P. Maitre M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Shein H.M. Wurtman R.J. Life. Sci. 1971; 10: 935-940Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, cAMP-dependent signaling pathways appear to be a major intracellular relay for environmental stimuli, able to modulate TPH expression at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. There is as yet no direct evidence to show that cAMP or other compounds modulate transcription of the TPH gene. To study in more detail the factors affecting serotonin biosynthesis in the brain, we used a molecular approach to assess the regulation of human TPH. We have studied the genomic organization of the hTPH gene and shown that a single transcriptional initiation site produces a large diversity of TPH mRNAs. This diversity is restricted to the 5′-leader sequence and results from a complex combination of exon and intron splicing in this region (Boularand et al., preceding article; (50Boularand S. Darmon M. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3748-3756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These different 5′-ends of the human TPH mRNA might be differentially degraded and translated and thereby involved in the regulation of TPH expression. In the present study, we show that the 2-kb region upstream of the single human TPH mRNA cap site exhibits the characteristic features of a promoter and is able to drive the expression of a luciferase reporter gene in primary cultures of rat pinealocytes and in PC12 cells. We then demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of the hTPH promoter is modulated by cAMP treatment in the two cell types, and we identify by site-directed mutagenesis a cAMP regulatory motif very similar to an inverted CCAAT box and which confers cAMP responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. KSLuc, a promoterless luciferase vector with a transcription terminator upstream of the single cloning site (HindIII) was constructed by Faust and Catherin 2W. Faust and A. M. Catherin, unpublished results. and was used to test the various sequences of the hTPH gene for promoter activity. The SalI-AvaI fragment of the hTPH promoter was isolated from the hTPH genomic clone λ12 (preceding article, (50Boularand S. Darmon M. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3748-3756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This fragment contained the sequence from position −2117 to +29 relative to the RNA initiation site. Four restriction fragments of the promoter were subcloned into KSLuc upstream of the luciferase reporter gene as follows. PL2117 was obtained by ligating the blunt-ended SalI(−2117)-AvaI(+29) fragment into the HindIII site (made blunt-ended) of KSLuc. Three additional contructions (PL1402, PL724, and PL51), truncated at the 5′-end of the hTPH promoter fragment, were produced using ScaI, SspI, and PvuII restriction sites, respectively. ScaI(−1402)-AvaI(+29), SspI(−724)-AvaI(+29), and PvuII(−51)-AvaI(+29) fragments were each subcloned into KSLuc. The constructs PL252, PL204, PL73, and PL73Δ3′ corresponding to deletions at the 5′- or 3′-end of the 2146-bp hTPH promoter fragment were obtained by PCR amplification using pairs of hTPH-specific primers. PL73Δ3′ differs from PL73 by the elimination of 29 nucleotides downstream of the TPH promoter cap site. The PCR products were isolated from low melting point agarose gels (1.5-3%) and inserted into KSLuc. The sequences of the upstream oligonucleotides in constructs PL252, PL204, PL73, and PL73Δ3′ were, respectively, O252 (5′-TTGGTTTGGAGAGAATGTCCA-3′), O204 (5′-TTGTGTGGTTAAGGACGGCC-3′), and O73 (5′-CTTCTCATTGGCCGCTGC-3′), and the sequence of the downstream primer was either O+29 (5′-CGGGCGCCAGTAGGTGC-3′) (for PL252, PL204 and PL73) or O+1: 5′-GGCCGGCGGCCCCGCG-3′ (for PL73Δ3′). The plasmid ΔTK-Luc (a gift from Dr Hughes de Thé; (16de Thé H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) contains a thymidine kinase promoter fragment (−109 to +51) fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene and was used to subclone wild type or mutated inverted CCAAT box oligonucleotides (Wt and M). The plasmids Wtx3 and Mx3 contain, respectively, three direct tandemly repeated wild type or mutated inverted CCAAT box oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide sequences used were as follows: Wt, 5′-CTTCTCATTGGCCGCTGCCCAG-3′; M, 5′-CTTCTCTTTAGCCGCTGCCCAG-3′. Mutations were introduced into hTPH promoter fragments by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR as described by Higuchi(17Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar), with the upstream (O-73) and downstream (O+29) primers described above as the outside primers and appropriate nested oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutation. The AP-4 binding site (CAGCTG) of PL73 was mutated to 5′-CTACTT-3′ with the oligonucleotide 5′-GGCCGCTGCCCTACTTCTCCGACGC-3′ and its reverse complement to give PL73A. The same procedure was used to produce mutations in the CCAAT box and the RE2 element separately and together. Sequences were as follows: PL73C (mutated CCAAT box), 5′-CTTCTCTTTAGCCGCTGCCCAGCTG-3′; PL73B (mutated RE2), 5′-CTTCTCATTGGCCTTTACCCAGCTG-3′; PL73BC (mutated RE2 and CCAAT box), 5′-CTTCTCTTTAGCCTTTACCCAGCTG-3′. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing with the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp). Pineal cells were obtained by the method of Buda and Klein(18Buda M. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, pineal glands from newborn Wistar rats (2 days old), were removed, placed immediately in Joklick medium, and then incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the same medium containing 0.25% trypsin. The pinealocytes were rinsed with RPMI supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, dissociated with a Pasteur pipette, and collected by centrifugation. Then, the pinealocytes were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and were plated at a density of 0.25 × 106 in polyornithine-coated dishes (diameter, 1.6 cm). After 20 h of culture, pineal cells were transfected with the DNA-lipopolyamine complex according to the method of Loeffler et al.(19Loeffler J.P. Barthel F. Feltz P. Behr J.P. Sassone-Corsi P. Feltz A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1815-1820Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, a DNA/lipopolyamine transfection solution containing 0.5 μg of DNA (0.375 μg of the DNA of the plasmid to be tested and 0.125 μg of RSV-CAT) and 5 μg of lipopolyamine (Transfectam) was added to the cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were incubated for 2 h and then washed and cultured in the maintenance medium. PC12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum. For transient assay experiments, 1 × 106 PC12 cells were resuspended in 0.15 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 and transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser with 5 μg of each DNA of plasmid to be tested, 3 μg of carrier DNA, and 2 μg of RSV-CAT plasmid to assess transfection efficiency. The cells received a single electrical pulse at 200 V delivered from a total capacitance of 960 microfarads and were placed in serum-containing medium. To study the effect of an increased intracellular cAMP level on hTPH promoter activity, pinealocytes and PC12 cells were treated with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP 24 h after transfection with hTPH promoter-luciferase fusion constructs and were harvested 20 h later for the luciferase assay. Pinealocytes and PC12 cells were harvested in 1 and 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, respectively, centrifuged, and resuspended in 200 μl of lysate buffer (25 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 15% glycerol, 1% bovine serum albumin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Luciferase assays were carried out using a Lumat LB9501 (Berthold) luminometer in 150 μl of reaction mixture (0.08 mM luciferin, 0.1 mM ATP, 25 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 15% glycerol). Preliminary studies indicated that the luciferase activity in the cell lysate of one transfection was in the linear range of the assay. The luciferase activity resulting from each hTPH promoter construct was normalized to the CAT activity resulting from the co-transfected RSV-CAT vector. CAT assays were performed using the liquid scintillation counting method. The amount of the cell lysate used was always in the linear range of the CAT assay, as assessed using a reference CAT preparation. Nuclear extracts from pinealocytes and PC12 cells were prepared according to the method of Schreiber et al.(20Schreiber E. Mathias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3901) Google Scholar). The concentration of protein was determined by the Bradford method and was between 1 and 3 mg/ml in nuclear extract preparations. The double-stranded TPH-CCAAT oligonucleotide (Wt) was labeled at the 5′-end by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reactions was performed at 4°C for 20 min with 0.2 ng of labeled TPH-CCAAT probe, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of nuclear extract, in the following buffer: 14 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 80 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 35 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol. Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (TPH-CCAAT (Wt), mutated TPH-CCAAT (M), CRE-TH, and POU-IgH) at 250-fold molar excess were used for competition experiments. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × Tris borate/EDTA at 10 V/cm. The oligonucleotide sequences used were as follows: Wt, 5′-CTTCTCATTGGCCGCTGCCCAG-3′; M, 5′-CTTCTCTTTAGCCGCTGCCCAG-3′; CRE-TH, 5′-GAGGGGCTTTGACGTCAGCCTGGCCT-3′; POU-IgH, 5′-CTGGGTAATTTGCATTTCTAAA-3′. A hTPH genomic DNA clone (λ12), containing the entire 5′-noncoding region and a 2-kb fragment upstream of the TPH RNA start site was isolated by screening a human genomic library (preceding article, (50Boularand S. Darmon M. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3748-3756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the hTPH gene was determined (Fig. 1) and revealed the presence of several canonical cis-regulatory elements including a “TATA box”(21Efstratiadis A. Posakony J.W. Maniatis T. Lawn R.M. O'Connell C. Spritz R.A. Deriel J.K. Forget B.G. Weissman S.M. Slightom J.L. Blechl A.E. Smithies O. Barall F.E. Shouders C.C. Proudfoot N.J.

Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), a “CCAAT box” in an inverted orientation (ATTGGCC; (22McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and a CCACCC element(23Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), which are located at −29 nucleotides, −62 nucleotides and −100 nucleotides, respectively, relative to the transcription start site. Upstream and close to the hTPH promoter cap site, there are other putative binding sites for transcription factors, some of which are required to promote constitutive or induced transcription from many viral or cellular eukaryotic promoters (three potential GC boxes, C/EBP, AP2 and AP4 binding sites, and two 9-bp imperfect direct repeats, RE1 and RE2). We first verified that the SalI/AvaI fragment carrying the 2,117 nucleotides upstream of the hTPH RNA initiation site had a promoter activity. Since no mammalian serotonergic neuronal cell line or immortalized pineal gland cell line expressing the TPH gene was available, the hybrid construct (PL2117) was used to transfect primary cultures of newborn rat pinealocytes. The promoterless luciferase vector (KSLuc) was similarly introduced into these cells as negative control of transfection. The resulting luciferase activity was normalized with respect to the CAT activity expressed from a co-transfected plasmid carrying an RSV promoter-CAT gene fusion (RSV-CAT; (24Gorman C. Padmanabhan R. Howard B. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The 2,117-bp TPH promoter-luciferase construct, in the sense orientation (PL2117), efficiently directed luciferase expression, whereas the same fragment, in the reverse orientation (PL2117AS), did not (Fig. 2). Thus, the 2,117-bp genomic fragment functioned as a promoter in an in vitro assay. To further characterize the regulatory domains of the hTPH promoter that are involved in the basal transcriptional activity of this gene, several deletions were generated, either by enzymatic restriction (PL1402 and PL724) or by PCR amplification (PL252, PL204, and PL73) and inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The luciferase activity expressed by constructions PL1402, PL724, PL252, PL204 and PL73, which contained 1,402, 724, 252, 204, and 73 bp of the hTPH 5′-flanking region, respectively, showed that deletions of fragments in the region between positions −2,117 bp (PL2117) and −252 bp (PL252) had no significant effect on hTPH promoter activity (Fig. 2). Longer deletions led to a large decrease of the transcriptional activity. Thus, the proximal 252-bp region upstream of the hTPH mRNA initiation site contains information required for promoter function. The transcriptional activity of the shortest construct containing the −73 to +29 bp fragment (PL73) was 85% lower than that of PL2117 but 5-8-fold higher than the background level obtained with the promoterless vector (KSLuc) or the construct PL2117AS. To determine whether the hTPH promoter sequence contained the elements necessary for tissue-specific expression of hTPH gene, the TPH promoter-luciferase fusion constructs were also used to transfect the rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) and human HeLa cells, which do not exhibit TPH activity. Transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 2) and HeLa cells (data not shown) each expressed high levels of luciferase activity. Thus, the transfected sequences did not contain information sufficient for cell type-specific expression. However, PC12 cells transfected with the construct PL252 containing the hTPH promoter fragment of 252 bp expressed twice the luciferase activity of constructs possessing longer hTPH promoter fragments (PL1402 and PL724). This suggests the presence of a weak tissue-specific repressor between positions −724 and −252 on the hTPH gene promoter (Fig. 2). Intracellular cAMP is a major second messenger in pineal gland and is thought to be a key regulator of TPH gene activity. We therefore investigated whether the hTPH promoter can be regulated by a cAMP-dependent mechanism. Pinealocytes were transfected either with the PL2117 plasmid or control plasmid (KSLuc) and treated with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP for 20 h. The luciferase activity of each construct in the presence and absence of 8-Br-cAMP was compared. Plasmid PL2117 showed a 5-fold increase in luciferase activity after 8-Br-cAMP treatment, whereas no modification of luciferase activity was obtained with the control plasmid (Fig. 3A). Usually, cAMP-regulated genes contain a consensus cis-acting element close upstream of the RNA start site, which mediates the induction of transcriptional activity by cAMP. The hTPH promoter does not contain the canonical CRE (5′-TGACGTCA-3′), but a putative AP-2 binding site (5′-GCCCAGCC-3′) was found at position −100, differing from the consensus sequence, (5′-CCCCAGGC-3′) by two mismatches. To delineate the 5′-end of the TPH cAMP-regulatory region and to determine whether the AP-2 binding site is involved in this response, several 5′-deletions of the hTPH promoter (PL1402, PL724, PL252, PL204, and PL73) were analyzed. The hTPH promoter deletion that removes the AP-2 binding site corresponds to the construct PL73. Pineal cells were transfected with each of these constructs and were treated or not treated with 8-Br-cAMP. For all constructions tested, including PL73 (−73 to +29), 8-Br-cAMP caused a reproducible 4-7-fold induction of luciferase activity as compared with the corresponding untreated transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Thus the AP-2 element is not involved in the hTPH 8-Br-cAMP responsiveness, and the motif confering this inducibility is presumably located either within the 73 bases upstream of the hTPH RNA start site or in the first 29 bases of the 5′-noncoding region of the hTPH. Two additional plasmids corresponding to 5′- and 3′-deletions of the hTPH promoter were generated by PCR amplification (PL73Δ3′ and PL51; Fig. 4). PL73Δ3′ differed from PL73 by the elimination of the +2 to +29 bp region. PL51 plasmid contained only 51 bases upstream of the cap site and lacked both the inverted CCAAT box and the AP-4 binding site. Transfection experiments in pinealocytes with PL73Δ3′ gave the same basal luciferase activity and the same induction by 8-Br-cAMP as did PL73, indicating that there were no cis-elements in the DNA sequence between +2 and +29 bp required for hTPH promoter activity or cAMP regulation (Fig. 3B). However, there was no increase of the luciferase activity after 8-Br-cAMP treatment and a decrease of the basal level of luciferase activity in pinealocytes transfected with PL51, although the transcriptional activity was 2-3-fold higher than the KSLuc background. Therefore, these results suggested that the cAMP-regulatory motif is located between −73 and −51 of the human TPH 5′-flanking region. The above observations were extended by transfection of PC12 cells with the same TPH promoter-luciferase fusion constructs. The results were entirely consistent with those described above except that the 8-Br-cAMP induction of the hTPH promoter was smaller (a 2-2.5-fold increase; data not shown). Three putative motifs entirely cover the 22 nucleotides (between nucleotides −73 and −51) required for the cAMP responsiveness: an inverted CCAAT box, an AP-4 binding site, and a 9-base imperfect direct repeat (RE2). We investigated the role of each of these three elements on the induction of hTPH gene expression by 8-Br-cAMP in pinealocytes and PC12 cells by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4). Synergy between the AP-4 and AP-1 binding sites has been reported to contribute to the cAMP responsiveness of the human proenkephalin promoter(25Comb M. Mermod N. Hyman S.E. Pearlberg J. Ross M.E. Goodman H.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3793-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To assess whether the AP-4 binding site is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the hTPH promoter by cAMP, the 5′-CAGCTG-3′ AP-4 binding site sequence was mutated to 5′-CTACTT-3′. The resulting construct (PL73A) was used to transfect pinealocytes. The luciferase activity of PL73A was almost identical to that of PL73 in control conditions and after 8-Br-cAMP treatment (Fig. 5A). Thus, the AP-4 binding site did not appear to have any role in the induction of the hTPH promoter activity by cAMP. Mutations of the 9-base imperfect direct element (RE2; 5′-CCGCTGCCC-3′) to 5′-CCTTTACCC-3′ and of the inverted CCAAT box (5′-ATTGG-3′) to 5′-TTTAG-3′ were similarly tested both independently and together. The mutated construct affecting both the inverted CCAAT box and the RE2 motif in the hTPH promoter sequence (mutant PL73BC) completely inhibited the induction of luciferase activity after 8-Br-cAMP treatment, showing that one or both of the two elements are involved in this response (Fig. 5A). The luciferase activity of mutant PL73B where only the RE2 element is modified was similar to that of PL73, suggesting that the RE2 motif is not involved in the response to cAMP. In contrast, the mutation disrupting the inverted CCAAT box (mutant PL73C) completely abolished the cAMP responsiveness. Analogous experiments with the four mutated constructs were performed in PC12 cells and confirmed these findings (Fig. 5B). Thus, these results identified the inverted CCAAT box as being involved in the cAMP inducibility of the hTPH promoter. To further analyze the interaction of the inverted CCAAT box of the hTPH gene with cAMP-dependent factors, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using nuclear extracts prepared from PC12 cells and pinealocyte primary cultures. The double-stranded 32P-labeled TPH-CCAAT oligonucleotide (Wt) was incubated with nuclear extracts from 8-Br-cAMP-treated or untreated pineal cells, and the resulting protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 6). EMSA demonstrated that 1 μg of protein extract from pinealocyte nuclei contained a factor able to bind to probe Wt, producing a single retarded band (named complex 1; Fig. 6, lane 2). The same DNA shift pattern was obtained with nuclear extracts from 8-Br-cAMP-treated pineal cells (lane 3), suggesting that the transcription factor(s) bind to this DNA sequence with or without cell stimulation by cAMP. The specificity of this complex was tested by adding a 250-fold molar excess of either unlabeled TPH-CCAAT oligonucleotide (Wt) or mutated TPH-CCAAT oligonucleotide (M) to the binding reaction (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 5). The competitive displacement of the retarded probe was observed only with the Wt unlabeled TPH-CCAAT oligonucleotide. Then, these results indicated that complex 1 is formed by sequence-specific binding and that the mutated bases within the inverted CCAAT box are necessary for protein-DNA interaction. Finally, we tested whether the nuclear factors composing this complex could also bind a functional CRE sequence; we added an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the CRE consensus sequence of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene(26Lewis E.J. Harrington C.A. Chikaraishi D.M. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), to compete for the binding of pinealocyte nuclear proteins to the labeled TPH-CCAAT probe (Wt). The addition of a 250-fold molar excess of unlabeled CRE-TH did not displace the binding of factors from the probe, demonstrating that transcriptional factors that interacted with the inverted CCAAT box did not belong to the CRE binding protein family (Fig. 6, lane 6). Gel retardation assays using nuclear extracts prepared from PC12 cells gave a pattern of specific bands similar to that obtained with the pinealocytes. EMSA with untreated (data not shown) and 8-Br-cAMP-treated PC12 nuclear extracts showed one major shifted band (named 1) and two minor bands (2 and 3) (Fig. 7, lane 2).

Purified Factor VIII was dissociated into its separate subunits, and the isolated light chain was cleaved by thrombin at position Arg1689 or by Factor Xa at position Arg1721. These Factor VIII light chain derivatives then were used for reconstitution with purified Factor VIII heavy chain to obtain heterodimers that were exclusively cleaved within the light chain. Intact and cleaved light chain could effectively be reassociated with heavy chain, with concomitant regain of Factor VIII cofactor function. The association rate constant of Factor Xa-cleaved light chain was found to be 3-fold lower than that of thrombin-cleaved or intact light chain, suggesting a role of the region Ser1690-Arg1721 in subunit assembly. Dissociation rate constants, however, were independent of Factor VIII light chain cleavage. Low ionic strength was observed to promote association but to destabilize the Factor VIII heterodimer. At high ionic strength, Factor VIII dissociation was extremely slow (koff≈ 10−5 s−1) for all Factor VIII light chain derivatives, indicating that Factor VIII light chain cleavage is not related to Factor VIII dissociation. Furthermore, Factor VIII light chain cleavage does not affect enzyme-cofactor assembly, since the various light chain derivatives proved equally efficient in binding to Factor IXa (Kd≈ 15 nM). Studies in a purified Factor X-activating system demonstrated that thrombin and Factor Xa activate Factor VIII to the same extent. However, Factor Xa differed from thrombin in that it cleaved at Arg1721 rather than at Arg1689.

To test the hypothesis that a single multi-specific, ATP-dependent carrier mediates biliary secretion of glutathione S-conjugates, the present study compared the driving forces and substrate specificity for canalicular transport of S-ethylglutathione (ethyl-SG), a low molecular weight and relatively hydrophilic thioether, and S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione (DNP-SG), a larger and more hydrophobic anion, using isolated rat liver canalicular membrane vesicles. In agreement with previous findings, DNP-SG transport was stimulated by ATP, although there was considerable transport in the absence of ATP. ATP-independent DNP-SG transport was unaffected by a Na+ gradient, was enhanced by a valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential, and was saturable, with both high affinity (Km = 8 ± 2 μM) and low affinity (Km = 0.5 ± 0.1 mM) components. High affinity ATP-independent DNP-SG uptake was cis-inhibited by GSH, GSH monoethyl ester, glutathione S-conjugates, other γ-glutamyl compounds, sulfobromophthalein, and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS). In contrast, ATP-dependent DNP-SG uptake was unaffected by GSH, GSH ester, S-methyl glutathione, or S-carbamidomethyl glutathione, but was strongly inhibited by sulfobromophthalein, DIDS, and by high molecular weight and relatively hydrophobic glutathione S-conjugates. Transport of the low molecular weight ethyl-SG conjugate was only minimally stimulated by ATP (10-20%). ATP-independent ethyl-SG uptake was electrogenic, saturable (Km = 10 ± 1 μM) and was inhibited by GSH and all glutathione S-conjugates tested. These findings indicate the presence of multiple canalicular transport mechanisms for glutathione S-conjugates and demonstrate that the physicochemical properties of the S moiety are major determinants of transport.

https://openalex.org/W2018076581,"The regulation of sodium-dependent L-alanine transport is described for the first time in intestinal cells. Substrate analogue inhibition patterns and Dixon analyses indicated that uptake occurred via transport system B, an epithelial cell variant of systems B0,+ and ASC. System B served >95% of the Na+-dependent alanine uptake in both undifferentiated (2 days postpassaging) and differentiated (>9 days postpassaging) states of the human Caco-2 cultured intestinal cell line. (Methylamino)isobutyric acid-inhibitable system A transport accounted for <5% of total alanine uptake. System B activity was greater in undifferentiated cells compared with the differentiated state, and activity at any differentiation state was stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The maximal stimulation, determined by TPA dose-response/exposure time data, was attributable to a change in cell transport capacity (Vmax), with Kmax unaffected. The Vmax of system B was greater in 2-day-old cells (2.79 ± 0.21 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1; Kmax = 164 ± 26 μM alanine), decreasing to Vmax = 0.51 ± 0.03 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1 (Kmax= 159 ± 14 μM) in 9-day-old cells. Regardless of differentiation status, the sodium-activation Hill coefficient was 1.06 ± 0.10, and the alanine passive diffusion permeability coefficient was 0.53 ± 0.08 μl min-1 mg of protein-1. Phorbol ester up-regulated the Vmax of system B in 2-day-old cells to Vmax = 6.32 ± 0.37 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1 (Kmax = 169 ± 18 μM), and in 9-day-old cells to Vmax = 1.42 ± 0.05 nmole min-1 mg of protein-1 (Kmax = 180 ± 10 μM). Phorbol ester stimulation of transport occurred after at least 6 h of continual exposure, and was blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitors chelerythrine or photoactivated calphostin C. Protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and actinomycin D each blocked the phorbol ester up-regulation of system B activity.

Up-regulating transport provides a means to supply developing intestinal epithelial cells with amino acids during their rapid growth phase along the crypt to the villous axis.

Nonetheless, studies are lacking that describe the regulation of intestinal membrane transport systems that serve only neutral amino acids. Furthermore, the lack of a reported well defined regulated neutral amino acid transporter in intestinal has impeded the successful cloning of such an epithelial membrane carrier. Re-evaluation of the SAAT1 clone, originally thought to represent system A, has resulted in its reassignment as an SGLT2 variant of the sodium/glucose cotransporter(13Kong C. Yet S.-F. Lever J.E. J.

Robin-Leon S. Appay M. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Simon-Assmann P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar, 16Hidalgo I.J. Raub T.J.

Comm. 1992; 188: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 10% CO2/90% O2. Caco-2 cells were passaged following treatment with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Cells were reseeded at a density of 4.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish for future subculturing, or seeded in the 6-well cluster Falcon tissue culture dishes at a density of 3.86 × 105 cells/35-mm well for transport experiments. The day of seeding was designated as day 0. The growth medium was changed daily, and cultures were inspected daily using a phase contrast microscope. Amino acid uptake was measured in cells ranging in age from 2 days postseeding (undifferentiated) through 16 days postseeding (differentiated). Cultures were confluent on about day 5. Studies designed to compare transport in cells 2-9 days post-seeding were conducted using cells started from the same seeding parent cells. Transport activity was measured at room temperature (23 ± 1.0°C). Following pretreatment of cells with various agents (described below), cells were rinsed with “uptake buffer” (23°C) composed of 137 mM NaCl (or choline chloride), 10 mM HEPES/Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, and 2.5 mM CaCl2. The uptake was initiated by the addition of 1 ml of this buffer containing also L-[3H]alanine (2 μCi/ml, 1 μM to 5 mM) or [3H]MeAIB (2 μCi/ml, 50 μM). Culture dishes were continuously shaken by an orbital shaker (1 Hz) during the uptake period. Uptake was arrested by aspirating the uptake buffer and washing 3 times with ice-cold buffer lacking substrate. Radioactivity of isotope extracted from the cells with 1 ml 1 N NaOH was neutralized with acetic acid, and then assayed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Protein in the NaOH extract was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Initial rates of transport activity were determined during the linear uptake period (2 min), with zero time points serving as blanks. Uptake rates are expressed as mol of alanine/min/mg of cell protein. To treat cells with various agents (cycloheximide, actinomycin D, chelerythrine, calphostin C, phorbol ester), growth medium was first replaced with serum-free media (i.e. DMEM containing nonessential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin, but lacking fetal bovine serum) for 2 h at 37°C in the humidified incubator. The cells were then exposed to each agent at various times and concentrations described below. Pretreatment buffers were replenished every 6 h. Caco-2 cells remained healthy (viability >99% by dye exclusion) during at least 24 h of exposure to serum-free media. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were prepared from Me2SO stocks, giving < 0.5% Me2SO in final media exposed to cells. This concentration of Me2SO did not influence uptake. All experiments were conducted at least in triplicate (including the zero time blanks), and all experiments were confirmed using at least two independently passaged generations of cells. Experimental means are reported ± S.E. Comparisons of means were made by analysis of variance with pairwise multiple comparisons by the Newman-Keuls method at p < 0.05. Transport kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (20Segal I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 441Google Scholar) by linear or nonlinear regression analysis. Uptake of L-[3H]alanine was linear up to at least 10 min at concentrations of 50 μM or 5 mM in either 137 mM NaCl or 137 mM choline media (Fig. 1). Alanine uptake measured in media containing 137 mM mannitol or 137 mM chloride or gluconate salts of K+ or Li+ were not significantly different from rates with choline Cl (p < 0.05; data not shown). For all subsequent measurements, the Na+-dependent fraction of alanine total uptake was obtained by subtracting the uptake measured in choline chloride medium from the total uptake measured in NaCl medium during the linear uptake period of 0-2 min. The uptake of 50 μM alanine was measured in uptake media containing NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 137 mM, with choline serving as Na+ substitute. As shown in Fig. 2, alanine uptake rates increased as a hyperbolic function of NaCl concentration in cells both 2 and 9 days postpassaging, and the sodium-dependent uptake rates were greater in day 2 cells compared with day 9 cells. Nonlinear regression analyses of the data fit to the Hill equation (20Segal I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 441Google Scholar) gave the same Na+-activation Hill coefficient (n = 1.06 ± 0.10 at each cell age, while the Vmax was greater in day 2 cells than in day 9 cells. For 50 μM alanine uptakes, the day 2 cell Vmax = 525 ± 20 pmol min-1 mg of protein-1, and NaK0.5 = 10.5 mM; day 9 cell Vmax = 149 ± 10 pmol min-1 mg of protein-1, NaK0.5 = 28 mM. The uptake rates of 50 μML-[3H]alanine were measured in both day 3 and day 9 cells in media containing 137 mM NaCl or choline chloride with 5 mM unlabeled amino acid analogues (or mannitol control). As Fig. 3 indicates, the relative pattern of inhibition was the same at both cell ages, but absolute uptake rates were consistently greater in day 3 cells compared with day 9 cells. Plotting the inhibited alanine uptake rates in day 9 cells as a function of inhibited rates in day 3 cells for all inhibitors gave a straight line with a slope of 2.5. Na+-dependent [3H]alanine transport was strongly inhibited by cysteine, threonine, serine, glutamine, and asparagine, with weaker inhibition by other neutral (dipolar) amino acid analogues (Fig. 3). Dixon analyses of glutamine (Ki = 35 μM), glycine (Ki = 4.5 mM), and phenylalanine (Ki = 5.9 mM) inhibition of sodium-dependent L-[3H]alanine uptake (data not shown) indicated classic competitive inhibition by these analogues (20Segal I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 441Google Scholar). It is notable that the bicyclo amino acid BCH partially inhibited sodium-dependent alanine uptake. MeAIB and cationic amino acids inhibited <10% of sodium-dependent alanine uptake. Sodium-dependent 50 μM [3H]MeAIB uptake rates measured in day 2 Caco-2 cells (0.014 ± 0.001 pmol min-1 mg of protein-1) were at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than comparable 50 μM [3H]alanine uptake rates (e.g.Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4, Dixon analysis of the effect of unlabeled MeAIB on [3H]alanine uptake indicated that there was negligible interaction of MeAIB with system B in Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cell sodium-dependent alanine transport via System B was stimulated by TPA and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. On the other hand, dibutryl cAMP (500 μM) and forskolin (10 μM) each failed to influence alanine uptake activity (data not shown). The dose-response of TPA is shown in Fig. 5. In Caco-2 cells preincubated in serum-free media, the peak stimulation of System B activity was observed at [TPA] = 0.5 μM. Similar data were obtained for phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (data not shown). The phorbol ester effect was time-dependent, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Continual incubation of Caco-2 cells in serum-free media containing 0.5 μM TPA for at least 6 h was required to stimulate system B activity. Maximal stimulation was attained by 24 h. Brief pulses (1-15 min) of 0.5 μM TPA in serum-free media, chased by sodium-dependent alanine uptake measurements during the ensuing 24 h period, were without affect on system B activity (data not shown). Sodium-dependent L-[3H]alanine uptake rates were significantly increased by TPA compared with control (p < 0.05), and this effect was abolished by cycloheximide (10 μM) in the incubation medium (Fig. 7), suggesting that de novo protein synthesis was involved in up-regulating system B activity. Actinomycin D (500 ng/ml) also blocked the phorbol ester stimulation of System B, suggesting possible transcription involvement. Fig. 7 also demonstrates that the specific protein kinase C inhibitors (21Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 22Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) chelerythrine (6.6 μM) or fluorescent light activated-calphostin C (50 nM) in the serum-free incubation media containing TPA during 24 h prior to the uptake experiments and also attenuated the TPA stimulation of the system B activity (p < 0.05). System B transport activity in cells with unactivated calphostin C (i.e. no fluorescent light) was not significantly different from TPA alone (p > 0.05). Fig. 8 demonstrates that sodium-dependent alanine uptake is greatest in undifferentiated, newly passaged Caco-2 cells, and thereafter declines as the culture attains confluence (at about day 5-6) and undergoes differentiation (≥ day 9). In addition, phorbol ester stimulated sodium dependent alanine uptake activity at all Caco-2 cell ages from 1 through 35-days-old postpassaging, compared with control cells not exposed to TPA (Fig. 8). Finally, the data of Fig. 8 indicate that the sodium-independent uptake of alanine remained constant regardless of cell age or TPA exposure. Day 2 and day 9 Caco-2 cells were preincubated with or without 500 nM TPA in serum-free medium for 24 h, and then alanine transport kinetics were measured in uptake media containing 137 mM NaCl or choline chloride over the alanine concentration range of 1 μM to 5 mM. Eadie-Hofstee transformations (20Segal I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 441Google Scholar) of the sodium-dependent uptake components are shown for each case in Fig. 9. For all cases of uptake, regardless of cell age or exposure to TPA, nonlinear regression analysis of the total uptake in sodium media gave a passive diffusion permeability coefficient p = 0.53 ± 0.08 μl min-1 mg of protein-1. Nonlinear regression analysis of the Na+-dependent component of uptake in day 2 control cells (i.e. not exposed to TPA) gave a Vmax of 2.79 ± 0.21 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1 and Km = 164 ± 26 μM alanine. For day 9 cells not exposed to TPA, the Vmax dropped to 0.51 ± 0.03 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1, and Km remained relatively unaffected at 159 ± 14 μM alanine. For 2-day-old cells exposed to TPA, the Vmax was increased to 6.32 ± 0.37 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1, while the Km remained unaffected (180 ± 10 μM), relative to cells not exposed to TPA. Finally, in day 9 cells exposed to TPA, Vmax = 1.42 ± 0.05 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1, and Km = 169 ± 18 μM. The intestinal regulation of neutral (dipolar or zwitterionic) amino acid absorption has been predicted by whole animal and tissue studies(8Karasov W.H. Smity M.W. Sepulveda F.V. Adaptation and Development of Gastastrointestinal Function. Manchester University Press, Manchester, United Kingdom1989: 157-168Google Scholar, 9Diamond J.M. News Physiol.

Res. 1990; 48: 635-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Salloum R.M. Stevens B.R. Souba W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G22-G27PubMed Google Scholar), yet the cellular mechanism responsible for transport regulation has not been reported. The present study represent the first description of the regulation of neutral amino acid transport by intestinal membranes. Our results indicate that (i) the predominant sodium-dependent L-alanine uptake system present in cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells is the system B transporter predicted by Christensen (5Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) to exist in absorptive epithelia; (ii) expression of system B activity is modulated as a function of Caco-2 differentiation status (e.g. cell age postpassaging); (iii) Caco-2 cells regulate carrier-mediated sodium-dependent transport of L-alanine by changing the membrane capacity (Vmax) of system B activity; and (iv) that this regulation involves de novo protein synthesis under the control of protein kinase C. The results indicated that a single transport system was responsible for sodium-dependent alanine uptake in Caco-2 cells and that this system was present in both the undifferentiated and differentiated states (cell age postpassaging). Alanine uptake was strongly Na+-dependent in both day 2 and day 9 Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4); neither K+ nor Li+ substituted for Na+ in activating alanine uptake. The sodium activation Hill coefficient of unity (Fig. 2) implicated a 1:1 Na+/alanine activation stoichiometry for secondary active transport (symport) in both day 2 and day 9 cells(23Gerencser G.A Stevens B.R. J. Exper. Biol. 1994; 196: 59-75PubMed Google Scholar). The analogue inhibition pattern for both the day 2 and day 9 cells was the same whether the absolute uptake rates or transport capacity changed as a function of cell differentiation status (Fig. 3). Together with the kinetic analyses giving a shift in Vmax, but not Km, with advancing cell age (see “Results”; Fig. 9), the data indicated that a single sodium-dependent alanine transport system was regulated in Caco-2 cells. Functional studies in a variety of cell types indicate that sodium-dependent alanine uptake could possibly be served by several different transport systems, although all systems do not necessarily occur in a given cell type. In membranes of intestinal cells, the primary candidates for this sodium-activated transporter include systems A, B0,+, B, or ASC(1Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2Mailliard M. Stevens B.R. Mann G. Gastroenterology. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 3Stevens B.R. Kilberg M.S. Haussinger D. Mammalian Amino Acid Transport. Plenum Publishing Corp., NY1992Google Scholar, 4Stevens B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: R458-R463PubMed Google Scholar). Our data support the notion that the sodium-dependent uptake of alanine in Caco-2 cells was solely by system B. System A is characteristically defined by exclusive uptake of, or inhibition by MeAIB or AIB(1Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that the absolute uptake rate of [3H]MeAIB uptake in Caco-2 cells was several orders of magnitude less than that of [3H]alanine uptake, and that MeAIB poorly blocked alanine uptake (Fig. 3). Furthermore, Dixon analysis (Fig. 4) indicated a lack of competitive interaction between MeAIB and alanine uptake. These combined observations indicated that system A provides a minimal, if any, contribution to alanine uptake in Caco-2 cells. System B0,+ is developmentally regulated in blastocysts and mediates uptake of both cationic and neutral amino acids(24Van Winkle L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The neutral substrates include BCH and amino acids branching at the α and β carbon positions(1Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Van Winkle L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We previously speculated that B0,+ may be ontogenetically related to system NBB (neutral brush border), a system that is found only in absorptive epithelia, and which serves neutral but not cationic amino acids(3Stevens B.R. Kilberg M.S. Haussinger D. Mammalian Amino Acid Transport. Plenum Publishing Corp., NY1992Google Scholar, 5Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Several studies have subsequently shown that the NBB inhibition pattern is expressed uniquely in the brush-border membranes of renal or intestinal epithelial cells of a variety of vertebrates and invertebrates(3Stevens B.R. Kilberg M.S. Haussinger D. Mammalian Amino Acid Transport. Plenum Publishing Corp., NY1992Google Scholar, 4Stevens B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: R458-R463PubMed Google Scholar, 5Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 6Stevens B.R. Kaunitz J.D. Wright E.M. Annu. Rev.

Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Following discussions with Christensen, we subsequently changed our original naming of “system NBB” (6Stevens B.R. Kaunitz J.D. Wright E.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1984; 46: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) to “system B” (3Stevens B.R. Kilberg M.S. Haussinger D. Mammalian Amino Acid Transport. Plenum Publishing Corp., NY1992Google Scholar, 4Stevens B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: R458-R463PubMed Google Scholar) to reflect its relationship to B0,+ and to be consistent with the Christensen nomenclature(5Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). It is notable that the analogue inhibition pattern of Fig. 3 was minimally affected by cationic amino acids, and the neutral analogues inhibited alanine uptake in the pattern reminiscent of B0,+. The apparent Km of about 160-180 μML-alanine measured in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 9) was similar to that for system B reported for apical membranes isolated from intestinal epithelial cells(6Stevens B.R. Kaunitz J.D. Wright E.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1984; 46: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). System ASC is a related pathway found in virtually all cells types, but intestinal ASC activity is constitutively low, is not regulated, and is apparently restricted to the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells(2Mailliard M. Stevens B.R. Mann G. Gastroenterology. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 5Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 6Stevens B.R. Kaunitz J.D. Wright E.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1984; 46: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Furthermore, classic system ASC shows less tolerance to glycine and phenylalanine than the apical membrane system B(5Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 6Stevens B.R. Kaunitz J.D. Wright E.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1984; 46: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 7Maenz D.D. Patience J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22079-22086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In concert, the previous and present observations assign system B as the sodium-dependent alanine uptake pathway in Caco-2 cells. Our results indicated that the simple passive diffusion component of alanine uptake was the same (p = 0.53 ± 0.08 μl min-1 mg of protein-1) regardless of differentiation status (cell age) and that passive diffusion contributed very little to the total uptake. For example, in day 2 cells, passive diffusion contributes only about 5% to total uptake at 160 μM alanine. This indicates that the mechanism regulating alanine uptake into Caco-2 cells does not involve modifications in the membranes' passive permeability to alanine. On the other hand, alanine uptake activities expressed as a function of cell age (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 8) were reflected in the nearly 6-fold increase in sodium-dependent system B transport capacity (Vmax) in day 2 cells compared with day 9 cells, with no change in apparent Km (Fig. 9). As described above, the Na+-activation Hill number was the same (n = 1.06 ± 0.10) for both day 2 and day 9 cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that the differentiation-dependent modification of transport activity may not involve modifications in sodium-activation sites of system B carrier proteins. These observations suggest that the activity differences were likely caused by a change in the number of copies of functional transporters in the membrane rather than by modification of existing transporter affinities to either alanine substrate or activator Na+. The linear relationship of the analogue inhibitor data of Fig. 3, taken with the other kinetic indicators of differentiation-dependent decrease in uptake capacity (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and 10-12) are consistent with concept that sodium-dependent alanine transport in Caco-2 cells occurs primarily via a single transport system (system B), and that the membrane capacity for transport by this system is greater in newly passaged undifferentiated cells compared with day 9 differentiated cells. Differentiation-dependent changes in transporter capacities have been reported for sodium/glucose and H+/dipeptide transport in Caco-2 cells(17Blais A. Bissonette P. Berteloot A. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 99: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Brandsch M. Miyamoto Y. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and confirmed by us (data not shown). However, in these cases transport activity increased with advancing cell age, in direct contrast to the present finding of a decrease in alanine transport with advancing cell age postpassaging. These diametrically opposed observations rule out the possibility that the differentiation-associated transport regulation was due to nonspecific membrane effects, such as changes in ion electrochemical gradients. These observations also indicated that glucose, dipeptide, and alanine uptakes in Caco-2 cells are likely independently regulated. The differentiation-related decrease in system B transport activity paralleled the differentiation-related decrease in cell proliferation rates measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (data not shown). This may reflect the cells' anabolic requirement for free amino acids during rapid growth that occurs in the undifferentiated state, relative to the demand for glucose(17Blais A. Bissonette P. Berteloot A. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 99: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of system B activity likely involved protein kinase C because the tumor promoter phorbol ester TPA stimulated sodium-dependent alanine uptake in Caco-2 cells (Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8:, Figure 9:), and this stimulation was blocked by chelerythrine or photoactivated calphostin C (Fig. 7). Chelerythrine specifically inhibits the catalytic domain of protein kinase C with an IC50 several orders of magnitude less than that for protein kinase A or any other protein kinase(21Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 22Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Photoactivation of calphostin C generates a short lived species that permanently inactivates the phorbol ester binding portion of protein kinase C with an IC50 of about 50 nM(22Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Bruns R.D. Miller F.P. Merriman R.L. Howbert J.J. Heath W.F. Kobayashi E. Takahashi I. Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In a separate set of experiments (data not shown), forskolin (10 μM) or dibutryl cAMP (500 μM) did not affect alanine uptake activities in our Caco-2 cells, further reinforcing the notion that protein kinase A was likely not involved in regulating system B transport activity. Phorbol ester stimulated system B uptake at any given cell age (Fig. 8), even in the differentiated state (≥ day 9). The stimulation was due to an increase in the membrane capacity (Vmax) to transport alanine via system B (Fig. 9), and not due to a change in transport affinity (Km). The long time period required for TPA up-regulation (Fig. 6) precludes rapid (minutes) post-translational modifications such as phosphorylations of existing carrier polypeptides. We are currently in the process of investigating the possible autocrine/paracrine/endocrine factors that could trigger the rise in Caco-2 protein kinase C activity leading to augmented alanine uptake. The phorbol ester up-regulation of system B activity involved de novo protein synthesis. Transcription and/or translation events could be implicated because actinomycin D and cycloheximide each blocked the increase in system B Vmax that was stimulated by TPA (Fig. 7). Cycloheximide or actinomycin D blocked the stimulation effect of TPA only after a continual 24-h exposure period (Fig. 7); exposure to the protein synthesis inhibitors for periods less than 6 h were ineffective in blocking TPA stimulation (data not shown). Although it is tempting to speculate that the change in transport capacity (Vmax) was due simply to increased copies of the system B carrier polypeptide, we cannot rule out the possibility of a more complex scenario involving transcription regulators and/or transporter regulatory subunits. Such an alternative means of regulation could be analogous to the hypothetical model of SGLT1 carrier regulation by RS1 putative regulatory subunits (27Koepsell H. Veyhl M. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 4: 206-216Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) proposed for intestinal apical membranes. Investigating and confirming any model of regulation awaits the cloning of system B carrier polypeptides and any related regulatory factors. At the present time, there have been no transporters cloned that are solely responsible for sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transport(28Bertran J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 4: 217-241Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the SAAT1 clone (13Kong C. Yet S.-F. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1509-1512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was originally thought to be the system A transporter, further scrutiny revealed that this clone was actually the SGLT2 variant of the Na+/glucose cotransporter(14Mackenzie B. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D. Lever J.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22488-22491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is hoped that the present report describing a well-defined in vitro model of system B activity regulation will lead to successful cloning of a neutral amino acid transporter of epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1602361580,"In land plants in particular, it has been well established that chlorophyll intermediates, Mg-protoporphyrin, Mg-protoporphyrin monomethylester, protochlorophyllide, and chlorophyllide occur as monovinyl and divinyl forms. The pool of monovinyl and divinyl intermediates differ according to species, age of tissue, and light regime. In this study, we investigated the monovinyl and divinyl characteristics of protochlorophyllide and chlorophyllide in the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic eubacterium Rhodobactercapsulatus. Our results indicate that mutations in genes known to completely block the reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide (such as bchN, bchB, and bchL mutants), accumulate a pool of monovinyl and divinyl forms of protochlorophyllide just as observed in plants. However, we also observed that directed insertion and deletion mutations in bchJ, a gene located in the photosynthesis gene cluster, affected the ratio of monovinyl and divinyl protochlorophyllide. Specifically, bchJ-disrupted strains accumulate reduced levels of bacteriochlorophyll concomitant with the accumulation of divinyl protochlorophyllide. Mutants of bchJ in combination with a second mutation in bchL still produce a mixed pool of monovinyl and divinyl protochlorophyllide; however, the ratio of monovinyl to divinyl protochlorophyllide is skewed in favor of divinyl protochlorophyllide. These results thus identify bchJ as the first sequenced gene that affects the divinyl to monovinyl ratio of photopigment intermediates in any photosynthetic organism. In addition, the results of our study also suggest that light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase is discriminatory for a monovinyl substrate. In land plants in particular, it has been well established that chlorophyll intermediates, Mg-protoporphyrin, Mg-protoporphyrin monomethylester, protochlorophyllide, and chlorophyllide occur as monovinyl and divinyl forms. The pool of monovinyl and divinyl intermediates differ according to species, age of tissue, and light regime. In this study, we investigated the monovinyl and divinyl characteristics of protochlorophyllide and chlorophyllide in the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic eubacterium Rhodobactercapsulatus. Our results indicate that mutations in genes known to completely block the reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide (such as bchN, bchB, and bchL mutants), accumulate a pool of monovinyl and divinyl forms of protochlorophyllide just as observed in plants. However, we also observed that directed insertion and deletion mutations in bchJ, a gene located in the photosynthesis gene cluster, affected the ratio of monovinyl and divinyl protochlorophyllide.

Accordingly at low K+ (6 mM) medium, its intracellular Na+ concentration is only slightly lower (1.5-2×) than the extracellular concentration (50 mM), explaining the high sensitivity to Na+ (≥30 mM) of the mutant. This Na+ sensitivity is shown to be a powerful selection for spontaneous second-site suppressor mutations that allow growth on high Na+ (≤0.6 M) with a rate similar to that of the wild type. One such mutation, MH1, maps at 25.7 min on the E. coli chromosome. It confers Na+ but not Li+ resistance upon ΔnhaAΔnhaB cells and exposes a Na+-excreting capacity, maintaining a Na+ gradient of about 8-10 (at 50 mM extracellular Na+), which is similar to that of the wild type. Although lower, Na+ excretion capacity is also observed in the ΔnhaAΔnhaB mutant when grown in medium containing higher K+ (70 mM). This capacity is accompanied with a shift in the sensitivity of the mutant to higher Na+ concentrations (≥300 mM). Whereas Na+ excretion by a wild type carrying Δunc is uncoupler sensitive, that of MH1Δunc is dependent on respiration in an uncoupler-insensitive fashion.

https://openalex.org/W1981147629,"Smooth muscle myosin filaments are much less stable than the skeletal muscle counterpart. Smooth myosin requires higher concentration of Mg2+ than skeletal myosin to form thick filaments and addition of ATP disassembles the dephosphorylated smooth muscle myosin filaments into monomers but not phosphorylated ones. We found that the addition of caldesmon to dephosphorylated myosin induced the formation of the filaments under the conditions where myosin by itself is soluble or disassembled. Although the induced filaments were short at 1 mM Mg2+, they became medium sized and seemed like side polar filaments with prominent 14 nm periodicity at higher Mg2+ conditions (8 mM). In the presence of F-actin, myosin filaments induced by caldesmon were associated along actin filaments to form large structures. The association of actin and myosin filaments was observed only in the presence of caldesmon, suggesting that caldesmon cross-linked actin and myosin filaments. This cross-linking was disrupted by the addition of calmodulin. Caldesmon-induced filament formation of dephosphorylated myosin in the presence of Mg2+-ATP may explain the existence of myosin filaments in relaxed smooth muscle fibers. A similar effect of telokin on myosin filament assembly was also examined and is discussed. Smooth muscle myosin filaments are much less stable than the skeletal muscle counterpart.

Caldesmon-induced filament formation of dephosphorylated myosin in the presence of Mg2+-ATP may explain the existence of myosin filaments in relaxed smooth muscle fibers. A similar effect of telokin on myosin filament assembly was also examined and is discussed. It is well accepted that the initial regulation of the smooth muscle contractile machinery is through the reversible phosphorylation of the 20-kDa light chain of myosin. This is catalyzed by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase and myosin light chain phosphatase (Hartshorne, 1987; Sellers and Adelstein, 1987; Kamm and Stull, 1989). Although phosphorylation of myosin is necessary and sufficient for the initiation of muscle shortening (Ito et al., 1989b), the response of smooth muscle to various stimulants is complex. It has been suggested that secondary regulatory systems might be involved in smooth muscle regulation in addition to myosin phosphorylation (Hartshorne, 1987; Marston and Redwood, 1991). Because of its ability to modify actomyosin ATPase, caldesmon has been implicated as a potential regulator of contraction, secondary to myosin phosphorylation. In support of a modulatory role for caldesmon, Katsuyama et al.(1992) reported that a synthetic peptide of caldesmon (Gly651-Ser667) which can bind to calmodulin and actin raises the basic tone of skinned smooth muscle cells. Caldesmon is an actin and calmodulin-binding protein isolated from smooth and non-muscle cells. In addition to actin and calmodulin (Sobue et al., 1981), caldesmon also has a specific affinity to tropomyosin (Graceffa, 1987; Fujii et al., 1987) and myosin (Ikebe and Reardon, 1988). Three actin binding regions were mapped to the COOH-terminal domain (Mornet et al., 1988; Wang et al., 1991), and the calmodulin binding region lies between residues 659-665 (Bartegi et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1991; Hayashi et al., 1991). The COOH-terminal domain of caldesmon is also involved in the binding to tropomyosin (Fujii et al., 1987; Dabrowska et al., 1985; Katayama et al., 1989; Hayashi et al., 1991), whereas myosin binding is restricted to the amino-terminal domain of caldesmon (Sutherland and Walsh, 1989; Katayama et al., 1989; Katayama, 1989a; Hemric and Chalovich, 1990). Although the primary structure of caldesmon and its domain mapping has been studied in detail, the physiological functions of caldesmon have not yet been clarified. A number of studies have shown that caldesmon can inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity in vitro, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of cross-bridge cycling (Marston and Redwood, 1991; Sobue and Sellers, 1991). Ca2+/calmodulin not only reverses the inhibition induced by caldesmon but also reduces the binding of caldesmon to actin (Sobue et al., 1981; Bretcher, 1984; Furst et al., 1986; Dingus et al., 1986). However, a much higher calmodulin concentration is required for the dissociation of caldesmon from actin than that for the reversal of inhibition. These results suggest that the reversal of the inhibition might not be due to the dissociation of caldesmon from F-actin but rather due to the change in the interaction of caldesmon with actin induced by Ca2+/calmodulin. The physiological significance of caldesmon-myosin interaction is not clear. Localization of caldesmon in smooth muscle cells was reported to be in the thin filament-thick filament domain but not at the thin filament-intermediate filament domain (Furst et al., 1986), suggesting a role for caldesmon interaction with the contractile machinery. Under physiological salt conditions in vitro dephosphorylated monomeric myosin adopts an unconventional conformation in which the tail portion of myosin is bent back toward the head-rod junction so as to form a folded structure (Trybus et al., 1982; Onishi and Wakabayashi, 1982; Craig et al., 1983). Upon phosphorylation, myosin changes to an extended conformation which is conceivably more suitable for filament formation. Dephosphorylated smooth muscle myosin can form thick filaments in the presence of high Mg2+ concentration; however, the filaments are readily disassembled by addition of ATP (Suzuki et al., 1978). Phosphorylated myosin filaments are more stable and are not disassembled in the presence of Mg2+-ATP (Suzuki et al., 1978). Although this may suggest that in smooth muscle, myosin filament formation may be regulated by phosphorylation, in vivo studies using quick-freeze electron microscopy have demonstrated that thick filaments are unambiguously present in resting smooth muscle cells where the majority of myosin molecules are assumed to be dephosphorylated (Somlyo et al., 1981). This discrepancy in the stability of smooth muscle myosin thick filaments in vitro and in vivo is unresolved. It has been suggested that high concentrations of myosin such as those found in smooth muscle cells could be sufficient to produce thick filaments even though myosin is dephosphorylated (Kendrick-Jones et al., 1987). Another possibility is that myosin-binding proteins might stabilize myosin thick filaments. We have explored this latter possibility and in this study, we show that caldesmon induces filaments of smooth muscle myosin. Smooth muscle myosin was prepared from turkey gizzard as described previously (Ikebe and Hartshorne, 1985b). Caldesmon was prepared according to Bretcher(1984). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder by the method of Spudich and Watt (1971). Telokin was prepared according to Ito et al. (1989a). Tropomyosin was prepared from turkey gizzard as follows. Muscle mince was homogenized with 4 volumes of 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolS-2myosin subfragment 2PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, then centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 × g. The pellet was washed four times with the same buffer. To the pellet, 4 volumes of 0.3 M KCl, 0.15 M KPi, pH 6.5, was added and homogenized. After 30 min at 4°C, the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was washed five times with 4 volumes of 1 mM NaHCO3. Following the homogenization with 3 volumes of 2 mM NaHCO3, pH was adjusted to 8.3 with Tris base. Tropomyosin was extracted for 2 h at room temperature. The extract was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, then subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. 250-500 g/liter ammonium sulfate fraction was collected, suspended with and dialyzed against (50 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mM DTT). The produced pellet was dissolved in 5 volumes of 1 M KCl. Tropomyosin was precipitated by adjusting the pH to 4.6 with acetic acid. After standing for 1 h, the precipitate was collected and resuspended in 1 M KCl, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5. Any undissolved materials were removed by centrifugation, and the final supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mM DTT and stored at −80°C. The final product contained no contaminant proteins as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. dithiothreitol myosin subfragment 2 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Myosin Mg2+-ATPase activity was measured in solution containing 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml dephosphorylated myosin, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mM [γ-3232P]ATP at 25°C. The ATPase activity was also measured in the presence and absence of 0.5 mg/ml F-actin and 0.2 mg/ml caldesmon. The liberated 3232P was quantitated as described previously (Ikebe and Hartshorne, 1985a). SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out in a 7.5-20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (1970). Various combinations of protein mixture samples were examined by negative staining electron microscopy. To obtain clear images of small protein aggregates, samples of various protein mixtures (0.5 mg/ml myosin, 0.14 mg/ml caldesmon, and/or 0.1 mg/ml telokin or 0.14 mg/ml myosin 0.2 mg/ml actin, 0.07 mg/ml tropomyosin, 0.15 mg/ml caldesmon) in buffer (50 mM KCl, 1 or 8 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) were applied to uncoated number 400 copper grids followed by 1% uranyl acetate containing bacitracin as described previously (Katayama, 1989b). When the sample was too thick, it was diluted five times with the same buffer prior to the negative staining. Electron micrographs were taken by JEOL 100CX or JEOL 2000ES with an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. The advantages and disadvantages for the use of this staining method have been described previously (Katayama, 1989b). Myosin-caldesmon-actin complexes in the presence of ATP formed large aggregates of thick and thin filaments, and the structural details were difficult to resolve by negative staining. In order to visualize the structural components of such a complex, we subjected the mixture to harsh mechanical mixing or ultrasonic agitation followed by quick dilution and immediate negative staining. Optical transforms of thick filaments were taken using Luzex-F real-time image analyzer (Nireco, Japan). The statistics on the distribution of the filament length was done with the same equipment. Myosin with phosphorylated light chain has high Mg2+-ATPase activity and can form thick filaments in the presence of ATP, initiating superprecipitation with actin filaments (Ikebe et al., 1977; Suzuki et al., 1978). The structure of thick filaments formed by phosphorylated myosin is stable irrespective of the presence of ATP under high (10 mM Mg2+) or low (1 mM) Mg2+ concentrations (data not shown). On the other hand, the activity of myosin with dephosphorylated light chain is kept low in terms not only of ATPase but also its ability to form filaments. Although dephosphorylated myosin forms side polar filaments (Craig and Meyerman, 1977) at high Mg2+ concentration (Fig. 1a), addition of small amounts of ATP readily disassembles the filaments almost completely to its soluble form (data not shown). Although caldesmon was first described as a thin filament component, it was later reported that caldesmon binds to myosin at S-2 region (Ikebe and Reardon, 1988). We examined the effects of caldesmon on the assembly properties of myosin. As shown in Fig. 1c, many short filament-like aggregates were observed upon addition of caldesmon, under the conditions where myosin by itself hardly formed filaments. Very similar filamentous aggregates were also induced when caldesmon was added to myosin solution in the presence of Mg-ATP (Fig. 1d), although their length distribution seemed somewhat larger than those in the absence of ATP. Under 8 mM Mg2+ concentration, dephosphorylated myosin could not yet form any filamentous structure if ATP was present (Fig. 2a). However caldesmon induced decent medium sized filaments (Fig. 2b) well comparable with those produced with phosphorylated myosin or with dephosphorylated myosin in the absence of ATP. The filaments seemed straight and stiff showing prominent axial periodicity corresponding to 14 nm throughout the whole length (Fig. 2c) and characteristic of side polar filaments. Because caldesmon is known to associate with thin filaments, we examined the effects of caldesmon-F-actin complex on myosin filament formation. Fig. 3a shows that the turbidity of the solution increased upon the addition of caldesmon to actomyosin in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The marked increase in the turbidity was not observed in the absence of myosin (data not shown). Similar turbidity increase was also observed when F-actin was added to myosin/caldesmon solution (data not shown). The increase in turbidity was dependent on caldesmon concentration and reached a plateau at 0.15 mg/ml caldesmon if actin concentration was fixed at 0.5 mg/ml. This corresponds to approximately 1 caldesmon/16 actin monomers. The results suggest that caldesmon can cross-link myosin and actin and supports our earlier report (Ikebe and Reardon, 1988). Tropomyosin which is also known to bind caldesmon did not significantly affect the increase in the turbidity of actin/myosin solution induced by caldesmon (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b shows that the turbidity of actomyosin induced by caldesmon declined by a further addition of Ca2+/calmodulin. The decrease in the turbidity occurred in calmodulin dose-dependent manner and more than 6 μM was required to completely reverse the caldesmon-induced increase in turbidity. This was consistent with the notion that calmodulin can compete with the binding of caldesmon to actin. The structure responsible for the large increase in turbidity was examined by electron microscopy (Fig. 4). In the absence of caldesmon the majority of myosin was dissociated from actin filaments and did not form filamentous aggregates (Fig. 4a). Addition of caldesmon induced filamentous aggregates of myosin as described above and these aggregates were associated along F-actin filaments to form large structures (Fig. 4b). This large actin-caldesmon-myosin filament complex tended to become entangled with each other and harsh mechanical mixing of the solution was needed to obtain clear image of each structural component by negative staining. To examine further the constitution of these complexes, actin, myosin, caldesmon, and tropomyosin were mixed in various combinations and were spun by low speed centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The protein composition of the supernatant and the pellets was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). Caldesmon, myosin, and actin coprecipitated. The molar amounts of myosin and actin which coprecipitated with caldesmon were higher than that of caldesmon. This is consistent with the observation by electron microscopy that the formation of large aggregates is not due to the cross-linking of F-actin and individual myosin molecules by caldesmon, but involves myosin in aggregated form. Caldesmon and myosin coprecipitated under the conditions where myosin by itself did not precipitate, although the amount of precipitated proteins were less than in the presence of F-actin (Fig. 5). Under these conditions the smaller size of each myosin filamentous aggregate was similar to aggregates formed under low Mg2+ conditions in the presence of ATP. If caldesmon was added to the mixture of actin and dephosphorylated myosin in the presence of ATP but with 8 mM MgCl2, very thick bundles composed of a parallel array of thick and thin filaments were formed and were reminiscent of stress fiber in the cell. The filaments involved in such bundles associated with each other so tightly that the harsh mixing, which was effective under 1 mM Mg2+ conditions, hardly altered the final image of the complex. It was necessary to subject the entire mixture to ultrasonic agitation to effect partial dissociation (Fig. 4, c and d). Negatively stained images of forcibly dissociated bundles showed the parallel array of actin filaments together with myosin filaments with periodic banding pattern throughout the length, indicating a side polar assembly. Monomeric smooth muscle myosin forms a folded (10 S myosin) or an extended structure (6 S myosin), depending on its environment. Thick filaments are formed only from the latter conformers (Hartshorne, 1987). Since the two conformations are characterized by distinct enzyme activities (Ikebe et al., 1983), we examined the effect of caldesmon on the equilibrium between 10 S and 6 S myosins. The KCl dependence of Mg2+-ATPase of dephosphorylated myosin was measured in the presence and absence of caldesmon and/or actin (Fig. 6). The depression of the Mg2+-ATPase activity below 0.3 M KCl, which reflects the myosin conformational transition from 6 to 10 S, was unaffected by caldesmon and/or actin. At lower KCl conditions where caldesmon induced formation of filamentous myosin as well as actin-myosin filament cross-linking, the Mg2+-ATPase activity was not influenced by caldesmon. These results suggest that the formation of the small myosin filamentous aggregate might not be due to the change in the myosin conformation. It was recently reported that telokin, a protein whose primary amino acid sequence is identical to the tail part of myosin light chain kinase, might contribute to the stabilization of the thick filament structure of dephosphorylated myosin in the presence of ATP (Shirinsky et al., 1993). We have found that dephosphorylated myosin filaments were induced by the addition of telokin. However, the size and shapes of the filaments observed in our hands were less homogenous than those induced by caldesmon, including the slender ones and some aggregates under 1 mM Mg2+ conditions (Fig. 7b). In the presence of 8 mM Mg2+, myosin aggregates consisted of a mixture of very long and medium to small sized filaments. The filaments in the very long population often showed a curved contour with a tendency to merge with each other giving a somewhat fragile appearance. When caldesmon and telokin were simultaneously added to the solution of dephosphorylated myosin, the observed filaments were shorter than the longest population in the latter case but were more homogenous in shape and size (length distribution was 0.95 + 0.25 μm for ∼100 filaments in some selected fields) as compared with telokin alone. The tendency for filaments to merge was less, although they sometimes aligned themselves side-by-side. The density of myosin molecules in the background seemed less than the other cases, indicating that most molecules were efficiently taken up into filamentous form. These filaments also showed prominent 14 nm periodicity, indicating an ordered structure. Myosin light chain kinase did not induce thick filament formation at all, in spite of the existence of the amino acid sequence identical to telokin at its COOH-terminal domain (data not shown). Caldesmon can bind various smooth muscle contractile proteins such as actin (Sobue et al., 1981), tropomyosin (Graceffa et al., 1987), and myosin (Ikebe and Reardon, 1988) within distinct domains (Marston and Redwood, 1991; Sobue and Sellers, 1991). It was suggested previously that caldesmon can cross-link F-actin and myosin (Ikebe and Reardon, 1988; Marston et al., 1992; Hemric and Chalovich, 1988), but detailed structures of such myosin aggregates have not been investigated. The present study confirmed the cross-linking of F-actin and myosin by caldesmon, but more importantly, this study demonstrated that caldesmon induced the assembly of myosin filaments in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. Smooth muscle myosin requires a higher Mg2+ concentration (⋍8∼15 mM) for thick filament formation as compared with the concentration required by skeletal myosin. Even at high Mg2+ concentration the dephosphorylated myosin filaments are disassembled by the addition of Mg2+-ATP (Suzuki et al., 1978). Under these conditions, myosin has been shown to be in a monomeric, 10 S conformation as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (Trybus et al., 1982; Ikebe et al., 1983; Suzuki et al., 1978; Onishi and Wakabayashi, 1982). In the present study we confirmed that freshly isolated smooth muscle dephosphorylated myosin did not form filaments under lower Mg2+ conditions (⋍1 mM). At higher Mg2+ concentration (⋍8 mM) dephosphorylated myosin formed thick filaments (Fig. 1a), but this was readily disassembled by the addition of Mg2+-ATP (Fig. 1b). By raising Mg2+ concentration to 8 mM, such small aggregates of myosin grew into the filaments whose size was comparable with that of dephosphorylated myosin in the absence of ATP or phosphorylated myosin in the absence or presence of ATP. The small aggregates of myosin induced by caldesmon at low Mg2+ condition might act as a precursor or “seed.” Larger myosin filaments induced by caldesmon can be produced either from small myosin oligomer or monomer, but in either case caldesmon seems to shift the equilibrium between monomeric myosin and filamentous myosin toward the formation of filaments. Under low Mg2+ conditions in which myosin alone exists as monomer or small oligomers but not large filaments, caldesmon induced formation of filamentous aggregates of myosin though these filaments were smaller than that observed with myosin alone at higher Mg2+ concentration. It is known that caldesmon itself forms aggregate due to oxidation. However, we do not think that caldesmon aggregation is involved in the observed myosin filament formation because: 1) caldesmon was treated with 5 mM DTT to reduce any oxidized species of caldesmon; 2) caldesmon by itself was not precipitated during the sedimentation analysis; 3) electron microscopic observation failed to detect a large caldesmon aggregate; 4) the effect of caldesmon to induce the turbidity increase of actin/myosin mixture was saturated within the range of expected molar ratio of actin/caldesmon/myosin. It remains obscure as to how caldesmon stabilizes myosin filaments in the presence of Mg2+-ATP where dephosphorylated myosin alone is in the 10 S conformation and does not form filaments. One possibility is that a folded conformation of myosin is destabilized by binding of caldesmon at S-2 moiety (Ikebe and Reardon, 1988), and the tail portion is consequently extended and induces filament formation. Supporting this notion, we recently observed that native smooth muscle thin filaments show thin whisker like projections which are labeled with an antibody recognizing the NH2-terminal myosin binding domain of caldesmon. 2E. Katayama and M. Ikebe, unpublished observation. It is plausible, therefore, that the NH2-terminal domain of caldesmon protrudes from the thin filaments and binds the S-2 portion of myosin so as to stabilize the myosin filaments. The results of cosedimentation experiment where much more myosin molecules coprecipitated with caldesmon molecules suggests that caldesmon may exert a cooperative effect on filament formation by inducing myosin into some conformation that will polymerize. This may be less likely since 10 S myosin does not polymerize with 6 S myosin to form copolymer (Trybus and Lowey, 1987). Alternatively, caldesmon may bind to the S-2 region of several myosin molecules. This hypothesis is supported by previous findings by Katayama and co-workers (Katayama et al., 1989; Katayama, 1989a) that caldesmon contains more than two S-2 binding sites within the NH2-terminal and central domains. It has also been shown that the caldesmon molecule can bind several molecules of heavy meromyosin (Marston, 1989). Recent reports on the properties of caldesmon's COOH-terminal domain (Huber et al., 1993) also indicated its affinity to myosin. We also observed by electron microscopy that clusters of heavy meromyosin bind periodically to the thin filaments via their S-2 region.2 These results support the idea that caldesmon can bind several myosin molecules and stabilize its filamentous structure. It has been shown in two different types of smooth muscle tissue that the thick filaments are present in relaxed smooth muscle fiber (Somlyo et al., 1981; Tsukita et al., 1982), even though isolated dephosphorylated myosin fails to form stable thick filaments under physiological ionic conditions. As shown in the present study, caldesmon may help stabilize myosin filaments under physiological ionic conditions and resolve the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo reports. After completion of our experiments on the effects of caldesmon on myosin filament formation, a paper appeared concerning very similar issues to ours (Shirinsky et al., 1993). They attributed the stability of dephosphorylated myosin filaments in relaxed muscle, to the presence of telokin, an interesting protein whose function is not fully elucidated. We confirmed their results except in the distribution of the filaments in terms of size and shape. These differences may be attributed to the differences in our experimental conditions from theirs. In addition, we checked the effect of simultaneous addition of caldesmon and telokin on dephosphorylated myosin filament formation. Under such conditions, thick filaments were shorter but seemed more homogenous in size and shape as compared with those with telokin alone. It is notable that these long filaments showed clear 14 nm periodicity, giving rise to the appearance of native thick filaments (Cooke et al., 1989). Caldesmon and telokin are both the abundant constituents of smooth muscle cells. These results suggest they might work cooperatively to stabilize the organization of dephosphorylated myosin filament under relaxed conditions. It has been reported that telokin is not necessarily a universal component of all smooth muscle tissues and is deficient in aorta, trachea, and non-muscle cells (Gallagher and Herring, 1991). Caldesmon, on the other hand, distributes more widely among various tissues, including those above. Therefore, caldesmon might be a more universal factor in stabilizing dephosphorylated myosin thick filament structure in relaxed smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we observed that caldesmon-induced myosin filaments were tethered to actin filaments in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. This is consistent with the intracellular localization of caldesmon in the actomyosin domain (Furst et al., 1986) and suggests an important structural role in smooth muscle organization. In non-muscle cells, myosin colocalizes with actin in stress fibers. During mitosis, microfilament organization changes dramatically and stress fibers are disassembled during prophase. It was shown recently (Yamashiro et al., 1990, 1991) that caldesmon dissociates from microfilaments during mitosis probably due to the phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase. These results suggest that caldesmon may play an important role in stabilizing stress fibers in non-muscle cells. The present results show that caldesmon stabilizes myosin filaments and furthermore cross-links actin and myosin filaments to form actomyosin bundles that resemble stress fibers (Fig. 4c). These findings predict roles for caldesmon in the stabilization of stress fibers consisting of actin filament bundles and myosin molecules. E. Katayama expresses his cordial thanks to Prof. K. Hirosawa for encouraging the international collaboration. He is also indebted greatly to T. Shiraishi for her technical assistance in photography."
https://openalex.org/W1540183118,"The ubiquitin-dependent pathway for protein degradation has been found to play a major role in controlling protein turnover in the cell. Ubiquitin is one of the most conserved proteins yet identified, and up until now it has been thought to be present only in eukaryotes and archaebacteria. This is the first report on the detection and purification of ubiquitin from a eubacterium, the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis. The purification procedure included a heat denaturing step, fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation, two gel filtration runs (Sephadex G-50 and Superose 12), and a final hydroxylapatite chromatography. Comparisons with bovine ubiquitin showed a high similarity with respect to antigenicity to anti-ubiquitin (bovine), molecular mass (Mr = 6,000), isoelectric point (pI 6.5), and NH2-terminal sequence. The existence of ubiquitin in A. variabilis was confirmed by Southern hybridization. In in vitro experiments both cyanobacterial and bovine ubiquitin were covalently attached to several target proteins from A. variabilis, respectively. Data are presented which suggest ubiquitination of dinitrogenase reductase, the Fe-protein subunit of nitrogenase. Our findings imply that ubiquitination equivalent to the eukaryotic system is instrumental in this organism."
https://openalex.org/W2004935668,"GLUT4, the major insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform in rat adipocytes, rapidly recycles between the cell surface and an intracellular pool with two first order rate constants, one for internalization (kin) and the other for externalization (kex). Insulin decreases kin by 2.8-fold and increases kex by 3.3-fold, thus increasing the steady-state cell surface GLUT4 level by approximately 8-fold (Jhun, B. H., Rampal, A. L., Liu, H., Lachaal, M., and Jung, C.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17710-17715). To gain an insight into the biochemical mechanisms that modulate these rate constants, we studied the effects upon them of okadaic acid (OKA), a phosphatase inhibitor that exerts a insulin-like effect on glucose transport in adipocytes. OKA stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport maximally 3.1-fold and increased the cell surface GLUT4 level 3.4-fold. When adipocytes were pulse-labeled with an impermeant, covalently reactive glucose analog, [3H]1,3-bis-(3-deoxy-D-glucopyranose-3-yloxy)-2-propyl 4-benzoylbenzoate, and the time course of labeled GLUT4 recycling was followed, the kex was found to increase 2.8-fold upon maximal stimulation by OKA, whereas the kin remained unchanged within experimental error. These findings demonstrate that OKA mimics the insulin effect on only GLUT4 externalization and suggest that insulin stimulates GLUT4 externalization by increasing the phosphorylation state of a serine/threonine phosphoprotein, probably by inhibiting protein phosphatase 1 or 2A.

Insulin plays a key role in glucose homeostasis in humans and mammals by stimulating glucose transport in muscle and adipose cells (1Birmbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 239-297Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The glucose transport in these cells is catalyzed primarily by GLUT4(2James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F.

This insulin-induced, apparent redistribution of GLUT4 accounts for the major portion of the acute glucose transport stimulation by insulin in adipocytes(7Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. Simpson I.A. Karnieli E. Hissin P.J. Wheeler T.J. Hinkle P.C. Salans L.B. Fed. Proc. 1984; 43: 2251-2255PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin effect is reversible; removal of insulin causes a rapid net movement of GLUT4 from the plasma membrane back to the storage pool, reestablishing basal levels in both pools(8Karnieli E.

The GLUT4 storage pool has been isolated by subcellular fractionation as a subset of intracellular vesicles(9Zorzano A. Wilkinson W. Kotliar N. Thoidis G. Wadzinkski B. Ruoho A. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

Evidence indicates that GLUT4 co-localizes with clathrin at the cell surface and in clathrin-coated vesicles in adipocytes(10Slot J.W. Gueze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that GLUT4 redistribution involves vesicle trafficking including exocytotic and endocytotic pathways(11Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: 383-393PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously (12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that GLUT4 in rat adipocytes constantly and rapidly recycles between the plasma membrane and the intracellular storage pools in a manner describable by two first order rate constants, one for internalization (kin) and the other for externalization (kex), and that insulin modulates both rate constants, reducing kin and increasing kex to about 3-fold each, thus increasing the plasma membrane GLUT4 level by 9-fold. Biochemical mechanisms by which adipocytes regulate these rate constants constitutively and in response to insulin are currently unknown. States of protein phosphorylation regulated by protein kinases and/or protein phosphatases are known to play a key role in many cellular functions(13Lawrence Jr., J.C. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of this OKA effect, however, is relatively modest (3-6-fold) compared with the insulin effects (10-20-fold)(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Corvera S. Jaspers S. Pasceri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9271-9275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OKA has no effect on insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, indicating that OKA acts at a step distal to insulin receptor(19Corvera S. Jaspers S. Pasceri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9271-9275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). okadaic acid 3-O-methyl-D-glucose 1,3-bis-(3-deoxy-D-glucopyranose-3-yloxy)-2-propyl 4-benzoylbenzoate plasma membrane post plasma membrane fraction protein phosphatase 1 protein phosphatase 2A bovine serum albumin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In an effort to identify the biochemical basis for the regulation of GLUT4 recycling in adipocytes, we measured in this study how the GLUT4 internalization and externalization rate constants, kin and kex, respectively, are affected by OKA. We pulse-labeled the cell surface pool of glucose transporters in steady state with an impermeant glucose analog, [3H]B3GL, and measured the time course of the label mixing between the plasma membrane and the storage pool for basal and OKA-stimulated steady states. OKA stimulated 3-OMG equilibrium exchange flux by as much as 3.8-fold and increases the plasma membrane GLUT4 pool size as much as 3.3-fold. The steady-state kinetic analysis of the GLUT4 recycling in these maximally stimulated adipocytes revealed that OKA increases the GLUT4 externalization rate constant 2.8-fold without significantly changing the internalization rate constant. We suggest that GLUT4 externalization is regulated by the phosphorylation state of a serine-threonine phosphoprotein and may involve the inhibition of a specific PP1 or PP2A. B3GL and its radioactive tracer [3H]B3GL (15 Ci/mmol) were synthesized as described(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]3OMG was from Amersham Corp. OKA was purchased from Calbiochem and stored as a 100 mM stock solution in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide until use. Insulin was a gift from Lilly. Pansorbin was obtained from Calbiochem. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads using male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g) as described previously(21Martz A. Mookerjee B.K. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13606-13609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procedures have been described elsewhere(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated adipocytes were incubated (30-40% cytocrit) in KRH buffer (130 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.25 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% BSA and 2 mM glucose or 1 mM pyruvate at 37°C. OKA or insulin, when used, was added in a small volume (2.5 μl/ml of cell suspension) to a given final concentration, and incubated further for 20-30 min. The cells were chilled in water bath (10°C) for 5 min and mixed with 24 μM of [3H]B3GL (1.7 mCi total) in 1.5 ml of prechilled, BSA-free KRH buffer in a polypropylene dish kept on ice. The mixture was irradiated on ice for 60 s using a 450-watt mercury arc lamp (Conrad-Hanovia, Newark, NJ) at a distance of 6.5 cm from silica sleeve and through a layer of water as a filter. Irradiated cells were immediately washed with 20 volumes of prechilled (10°C) incubation buffer to remove unreacted [3H]B3GL. The procedures were described elsewhere in detail (12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled adipocytes were resuspended in preheated (37°C) KRH buffer containing 0.1% BSA and 2 mM glucose or 1 mM pyruvate and incubated at 37°C (chase incubation) for a given duration for up to 60 min. Immediately after each chase incubation, the cells were rapidly chilled by adding 20 volumes of prechilled KRH buffer containing 1% BSA and 2 mMD-glucose, which reduced the cell suspension temperature below 10°C, and washed twice with the same KRH buffer at 10°C. Adipocytes were homogenized and, after removal of the fat cakes, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was recovered (crude plasma membrane fraction or PM). The 16,000 × g supernatant was again centrifuged at 212,000 × g for 90 min, and the pellet was recovered (total microsomal fraction or post-PM). When specified, the 16,000 × g supernatant was further separated into high density and low density microsomal fractions. Total membrane fraction was obtained by pelleting total homogenate directly by centrifugation at 212,000 × g for 90 min. These fractionation procedures have been detailed elsewhere(22Jhun B.H. Hah J.S. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22260-22265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were solubilized in 500 μl of TBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 2% C12E8, and undissolved particulates were removed by centrifugation (185,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C). GLUT4 in the particulate-free supernatant was immunoprecipitated at 4°C as described (12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using PCR3 (affinity-purified, anti-GLUT4 antibodies obtained by immunizing rabbits against the synthetic peptide corresponding to rat GLUT4 amino acid sequence 443-483) and Pansorbin (Calbiochem). The precipitates were solubilized with electrophoresis sample buffer (10% glycerol, 3.0% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1.0 mM EDTA, 2.5%β-mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and separated from Pansorbin by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 5 min) in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Glucose transport activity was quantitated by following the 3OMG equilibrium exchange time course using [14C]3OMG as a tracer, and calculating the first order rate constant for tracer exchange as described earlier(22Jhun B.H. Hah J.S. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22260-22265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to Laemmli(23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gel lanes were cut into 4-mm slices with a Bio-Rad gel slicer, and gel slice radioactivities were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LKB Rackbeta, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Semiquantitative immunoblotting and protein determination were performed as described elsewhere(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the experimental measurements are obtained in the form of the time constant, τ, for relaxation into the steady-state distribution in [3H]B3GL pulse-chase time course (see Figure 6:, Figure 7:), on the one hand, and an evaluation of the relative distribution between the two compartments once steady state has been achieved (SPM,eq and SST,eq) (see Table 1), on the other. The kinetic coefficients are calculated from the relationships τ = (kin+ kex)-1, and SPM,eq/SST,eq = kex/kin = Ke, the distribution equilibrium constant.Table I Open table in a new tab The time constant of the process, τ, is a particularly robust measurement in the sense that it is not compromised by several potential sources of experimental error. A time lag in the sampling process, for example, provided it is constant at each sampling, will have no effect upon the accuracy of time constant determination. This lag will appear only as a displacement of the time axis; since the time constant evaluation depends upon differential measurements in the time domain, it is insensitive to such a constant lag. The apparent time constant, τ, is also insensitive to incomplete separation between the plasma membrane transporter pool, and the cytoplasmic compartment, again assuming the degree of cross-contamination is constant over the series of samples. The measurements of the equilibrium distribution pool sizes, SPM,eq and SST,eq (Table 1), on the other hand, is sensitive to cross-contamination between the two GLUT4 pools in immunoblot experiments. In the present study, we minimized this problem by assessing the pool sizes in two separate steps. With insulin-stimulated adipocytes, we assessed the equilibrium pool sizes by immunoblot after subcellular fractionation. In the insulin-stimulated state, the difference between the two pool sizes is much reduced (37 and 63%) in comparison with the basal state, and thus the error due to cross-contamination is minimal(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then measured relative changes in the plasma membrane pool size SPM,eq between control and insulin-stimulated and OKA-stimulated states by [3H]B3GL labeling, where cross-contamination introduces little error(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Errors in the estimation of either the time constant, or the equilibrium distribution between the cytoplasmic and plasma membrane pools, will be reflected in errors in the computed values of the rate constants. From the relationships between kinetic coefficients and measured variables given above, it follows that a given percentage error in the estimation of τ appears as the same fractional error in the values of the rate constants. Added to this is the percentage error in the measured value of Ke, attenuated by the factors Ke/(1 + Ke) for kin and 1/(1 + Ke) in the case of kex. Data in Fig. 1 illustrate a typical time course of 1 mM 3OMG equilibrium exchange in isolated rat adipocytes and how it is affected by incubation with insulin and OKA. Insulin (7 nM, incubated for 20 min at 37°C) stimulated the exchange flux 8.1 ± 2.2-fold (mean of 12 determinations with ± S.D.). OKA (1 μM, incubated for 20 min at 37°C) also stimulated the exchange flux, but the stimulation was significantly less in extent (3.1 ± 0.5-fold, mean of three determinations ± S.D.) compared with that of insulin. The OKA effect was fully expressed at 5-min incubation and did not increase appreciably with further incubation for up to 60 min (not illustrated). The stimulation was a saturable function of OKA concentration, showing an apparent half-maximal effect at about 5 nM OKA (Fig. 2). These data with OKA are in accord with the previous reports by others(16Haystead T.A.J. Sim A.T.R. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G.

Each data point represents a 30 s, 3OMG equilibrium exchange time course measured in the absence (basal) and in the presence of OKA (stimulated) at a given concentration, otherwise identical to those illustrated in Fig. 1. The rate of exchange was expressed in terms of the first order rate constant (per second) calculated as described(22Jhun B.H. Hah J.S. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22260-22265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Data of subcellular fractionation and semiquantitative immunoblotting analysis have shown that OKA increases the cell surface GLUT4 level in rat adipocytes by recruiting GLUT4 from the storage pool(17Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Corvera S. Jaspers S. Pasceri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9271-9275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reproduced this OKA effect on GLUT4 recruitment here (Fig. 3). An acute (20 min) incubation of rat adipocytes with 1 μM OKA did not change total cellular (total membrane fraction) GLUT4 content, but significantly increased the cell surface (PM) GLUT4 level with a concomitant reduction in the microsomal (post-PM) GLUT4 level. The plasma membrane GLUT4 level was increased 2.8 ± 0.6-fold (mean with S.D., n = 3) in the presence of 1 μM OKA. The extent of this OKA effect, however, was considerably less compared with that of the insulin effect (Fig. 3). The PM GLUT4 pool size of insulin-stimulated (10 nM, 20 min at 37°C) adipocytes was readily detectable by immunoblot (Fig. 3) and amounted to more than one-half of the storage pool size (Table 1). That the error due to incomplete separation of the storage pool and plasma membrane in this assessment is minimal is confirmed by the observed changes in GLUT4 immunoblot intensity of LDM, the fraction that is little contaminated with plasma membranes: OKA (1 μM) and insulin (10 nM, 20 min) reduced LDM GLUT4 pool size to 85.4 ± 9.6 and 67.1 ± 6.1%, respectively (means of five independent determinations ± S.D.) of that of basal (Table 1). Relative changes in the plasma membrane GLUT4 level in adipocytes can be quantitated more precisely by the use of [3H]B3GL, a membrane-impermeable, covalently active, glucose analog, and immunoprecipitation(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OKA-treated adipocytes were pulse-labeled with [3H]B3GL in the presence of OKA at 10°C (see “Experimental Procedures”) and immediately subjected to subcellular fractionation to separate the crude PM and microsomal (post-PM) fractions. When the PM fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-GLUT4 antibody (PCR3), and the immunoprecipitate separated by SDS-PAGE, a single radiolabeled polypeptide of an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa was observed (Fig. 4), reproducing the pattern of [3H]B3GL incorporation to GLUT4 reported previously(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As also shown in (12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this 50-kDa radiolabeling was greatly suppressed when adipocytes were pulse-labeled in the presence of an excess of maltose, a nonpermeable, competitive inhibitor of glucose transporter (not illustrated), indicating that the 50-kDa label is due to glucose transporter. Little 50-kDa protein labeling was detectable when the post-PM fraction was subjected to the same immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE separation (Fig. 4), indicating that the labeling is essentially cell surface pool-specific(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of the 50-kDa [3H]B3GL labeling intensity revealed that the OKA-induced increase in the plasma membrane GLUT4 content is a saturable function of OKA concentration (Fig. 5). The effect was half-maximal at around 10 nM, and maximal at 100 nM with no further increase at 1 μM OKA. The GLUT4 level in PM was 3.36 ± 0.31-fold (mean of three independent experiments ± S.D.) greater in the OKA (1 μM)-stimulated adipocytes compared with that in untreated adipocytes (Table 1). Since [3H]B3GL labeling of microsomal GLUT4 was negligible (Fig. 4), this -fold increase calculation should be free from error due to imperfect separation of the two pools. In parallel experiments, insulin (10 nM, 30 min) increased the plasma membrane GLUT4 pool size by 6.37 ± 1.5-fold (average of three sets of determination ± S.D.) compared with basal adipocytes (Table 1). Isolated adipocytes were incubated either in KRH buffer alone or in KRH buffer containing 1 μM OKA for 30 min at 37°C, then photolabeled with [3H]B3GL for 60 s at 10-15°C as above (Fig. 4). The labeled cells were quickly resuspended into a prewarmed (37°C) KRB buffer and incubated at 37°C (chase incubation) for a specified time interval up to 60 min. Where OKA-stimulated cells were used, the same concentration of OKA was continuously present throughout the experiment, including chase incubation, to maintain steady-state conditions. At the end of each chase incubation, the cells were immediately subjected to homogenization and membrane fractionation at 10°C. The resulting PM and post-PM were immunoprecipitated using PCR3, and the 50-kDa radiolabel intensities of the immunoprecipitates were quantitated after SDS-PAGE separation as in Fig. 4. During the 37°C chase, the 50-kDa label intensity (labeled GLUT4) decreased in the PM fraction, with the decrement being stoichiometrically recovered in the post-PM fraction (Fig. 6). This apparent redistribution of labeled GLUT4 between PM and post-PM was quite rapid, and virtually complete within 10 min at 37°C for both basal and OKA-stimulated adipocytes. Immunoblot data (not illustrated) indicated that the amounts of GLUT4 protein in PM and post-PM remained constant throughout the chase incubation in these experiments. The radiolabel mixing time courses similar to these have been observed for basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the GLUT4 recycling in basal and insulin-stimulated rat adipocytes is a kinetically simple, first order equilibrium exchange process in a closed, two-compartment system. In the steady state, it can be described by the following equation, ln[(SPM,t*-SPM,eq*)/(SPM,0*-SPM,eq*)]=-t/τ(Eq. 1) where S*PM represents the amount of [3H]B3GL-labeled GLUT4 in the plasma membrane pool, τ is the time constant (= t½/ln 2) for the exchange process, and the subscripts 0, t, and eq signify values at the start, at arbitrary time t, and after complete tracer equilibration (estimated after 60 min) of the chase incubation, respectively. The plasma membrane GLUT4 label intensities after each chase revealed in Fig. 6 were plotted against chase time in Fig. 7 on a semi-log scale corresponding to. It is clear from this analysis that the GLUT4 recycling in OKA-stimulated adipocytes appears also to be a simple, first order process of equilibrium exchange in a closed, two-compartment system in steady state. The values of the steady-state unidirectional flux φ, time constant, and kinetic rate coefficients calculated for basal and OKA-stimulated adipocytes are shown in Table 2.Table II Open table in a new tab The observed shift in steady-state GLUT4 distribution from the storage pool to cell surface by OKA would involve an increase in kex, a decrease in kin, or changes in both. To determine how OKA affects these two rate constants, we calculated kin and kex for the basal and maximally OKA-stimulated steady states. The calculation uses the values for SPM, SST, and τ. Steady-state GLUT4 compartment sizes (SPM and SST) are obtained from the combined data of immunoblots and [3H]B3GL labeling for insulin-stimulated adipocytes as well as basal and OKA-stimulated adipocytes (Table 1). Values of calculated kin and kex are summarized in Table 2. OKA increased kex by 2.8-fold and reduced kin by 40%. The uncertainty associated with these values of the kinetic coefficients reflects both the error in the measurement of τ and that introduced through evaluation of the steady-state distribution, expressed in terms of the distribution equilibrium constant, Ke (see “Experimental Procedures“). Table 1 shows the Ke values calculated from the measured pool sizes; in each case, the error is estimated to be about 12%. Table 2 indicates the error associated with the measured time constant values, ranging from 16 to 24%. Since these errors should be statistically independent, they are combined as the root square sum, yielding the kinetic coefficient error estimates indicated in Table 2. The observed 40% change in kin value in the presence of OKA is not significant within these experimental errors, whereas the effect of OKA on kex observed here is highly significant.

Of these insulin mimetics, OKA is of particular interest as it is a specific inhibitor of serine-threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A(14Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar), and also it induces an insulin-like GLUT4 redistribution(17Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Corvera S. Jaspers S. Pasceri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9271-9275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data in the present study (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4: and Table 1) clearly demonstrate that OKA-induced glucose transport stimulation and GLUT4 recruitment are effected at a similar OKA concentration range (1-100 nM), and to a similar extent (up to 3.1- and 3.4-fold, respectively), strongly suggesting that OKA, like insulin, stimulates the transport primarily by GLUT4 recruitment. Our data here also demonstrate that the extent of the OKA-induced recruitment is considerably (by about 60%) less than that of insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment (Fig. 3 and Table 1), indicating that OKA mimics insulin action only partially. Our steady-state kinetic analysis of [3H]B3GL pulse-labeled GLUT4 chase time courses here (Figure 6:, Figure 7: and Table 2) demonstrates that the GLUT4 in OKA-stimulated adipocytes also recycles with two distinct first order rate constants, kin and kex, and that the value of kex in OKA-stimulated cells is 2.8-fold greater than that of basal (control) adipocytes, whereas that of kin is not significantly different between the basal and OKA-stimulated adipocytes. This is the first clear demonstration that OKA induces GLUT4 recruitment primarily, if not exclusively, by modulating its externalization pathway. This is in contrast to the insulin-induced GLUT4 recruitment in rat adipocytes, where both kex and kin are shown to be affected; insulin increased the former 3.4-fold and reduced the latter 2.8-fold(12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OKA thus mimics the insulin effect on GLUT4 externalization rate constant (kex) almost quantitatively in rat adipocytes, but fails to mimic the insulin effect on its internalization rate constant (kin). This would in part explain the fact that the maximum extent of GLUT4 recruitment is considerably smaller with OKA than with insulin (Fig. 3 and Table 1)(17Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Corvera S. Jaspers S. Pasceri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9271-9275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OKA at concentrations of less than 100 nM was effective in stimulating glucose transport and in inducing GLUT4 recruitment (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:). This is the same concentration range where OKA exerts its well known inhibition specific to PP1 and PP2A(14Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 15Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and strongly suggests that a serine-threonine phosphoprotein plays a key role in GLUT4 externalization. It is tempting to propose that insulin and OKA stimulate the movement of GLUT4 storage vesicle to the cell surface by invoking a common biochemical event, namely, an increased phosphorylation state of a serine-threonine phosphoprotein, probably mediated by an inhibition of PP1 or PP2A. The key phosphoprotein and the putative phosphatase proposed here are yet to be identified. Lawrence et al.(17Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that OKA increases the phosphorylation of the GLUT4 and three other proteins in the intracellular GLUT4 storage vesicles of rat adipocytes. It was also shown that only a small portion (20%) of GLUT4 in this pool is in a phosphorylated state, and insulin appears to increase GLUT4 phosphorylation, although slightly, in this compartment(17Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2324-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GLUT4 in the plasma membrane, on the other hand, is largely (50% or more) in a phosphorylated state in basal adipocytes, and insulin reduces GLUT4 phosphorylation in this pool(17Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus not unlikely that GLUT4 is the key phosphoprotein, whose phosphorylation at the storage vesicles triggers vesicle movement to the cell surface. Indeed, 3232P-labeled GLUT4 in adipocyte LDM was shown to be dephosphorylated in vitro by PP1 and PP2A. GLUT4 translocation by GLUT4 phosphorylation, however, is yet to be demonstrated(29Begum N. Leiner W. Beusch J.E. Sussman K.E. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3352-3356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin and OKA also cause a redistribution of Rab4 from GLUT4 storage vesicles to the cytosol in rat adipocytes, and the two agents are equipotent in this Rab4 redistribution(30Cormont M. Tanti J. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghan E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of Rab4 or its associated protein, rather than GLUT4 itself, may trigger GLUT4 externalization. Not studied in the present investigation is the effect of OKA on GLUT4 recruitment in insulin-stimulated, rat adipocytes, where OKA inhibits the insulin effect(17Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Corvera S. Jaspers S. Pasceri M. J. Biol.

(not shown) suggest that this second effect of OKA requires a slightly higher OKA concentration (0.1-1 μM), where it blocks the insulin-induced reduction of GLUT4 internalization. This is consistent with the recent proposal that insulin increases plasma membrane GLUT4 level largely by preventing GLUT4 internalization as a result of GLUT4 dephosphorylation at a serine residue(17Lawrence Jr., J.C.

In this report, we demonstrate that this effect is reversible within early times of protein kinase C activation (<2 h) but that prolonged exposure to phorbol esters results in a net loss of receptors. These effects are not due to the differentiation response of K562 cells to phorbol esters since bryostatin-1 also down-regulates the endocytosis of the transferrin receptor and shut downs receptor synthesis, but does not induce differentiation (Hocevar, B. A., Morrow, D. M., Tykocinski, M. L., and Fields, A. P.(1992) J. Cell Sci. 101, 671-679). We have characterized the early stages of receptor down-regulation which occur due to stimulation of receptor internalization from the cell surface. The fact that fluid-phase pinocytosis is also enhanced upon protein kinase C activation indicates that this effect is not specific for the transferrin receptor itself, but is a rather general cellular response to tumor-promoting phorbol esters. The fate of down-regulated transferrin receptors was followed in morphological and subcellular fractionation studies that demonstrate localization of this pool of receptors in early endocytic and recycling compartments. Our results exclude the possibility that transferrin receptor down-regulation results in trafficking of the receptor to lysosomal compartments for degradation. This idea is consistent with the observations that the time course of transferrin receptor degradation is not enhanced in stimulated K562 cells, while transferrin receptor synthesis is shut down. Our results rigorously demonstrate that activation of protein kinase C down-regulates the K562 cell transferrin receptor in two stages: acute regulation of early steps in endocytosis that results in an immediate reduction of ∼40% in cell surface number of receptors and a more chronic reduction in transferrin receptor synthesis upon prolonged exposure to phorbol esters (>15 h).

https://openalex.org/W2055171145,"In the thyroid, thyrotropin (TSH) stimulates both growth and function, and stimulates the production of cAMP which reproduces most of the effects of TSH. Here, we report evidence that TSH stimulates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade through a cAMP-independent pathway, in human thyroid. TSH stimulated MAP kinase activity (4-9-fold the basal level) measured in the cytosolic fractions of primary cultured thyroid follicles. Maximal activity was reached after 20 min and remained sustained for 1-3 h, TSH being as potent as EGF; EC50 was 1.5 nM TSH. Only a single isoform of MAP kinase (p42) was detected in the follicles. p42 was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and showed a reduced electrophoretic mobility in follicles stimulated by TSH. All these effects on MAP kinase were decreased by preincubation of the follicles with human anti-TSH receptor antibodies. The stimulation of MAP kinase by TSH was neither blocked by pertussis toxin nor reproduced by forskolin, cholera toxin, or 8-bromo-cAMP. In conclusion, in human thyroid cells, in contrast with previous observations on dog thyroid cells, TSH stimulates strongly MAP kinase through a pertussis toxin-insensitive and cAMP-independent pathway.

Science. 1992; 257: 1355-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) not only by a range of growth factors, but also by hormones acting through receptors that are coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) (4Kahan C.

Roger P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The TSH receptor belongs to the family of seven transmembrane domain receptors, and is coupled, through heterotrimeric G proteins, to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (8Nagayama Y. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 151-156Google Scholar) and, in certain species, to phospholipases C or A2(9Laurent E. Mockel J. Van Sande J. Graff I. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell.

In dog thyroid cells, TSH induces cell proliferation but does not stimulate MAP kinase. This cell proliferation is most probably mediated by an elevation in intracellular cAMP, since TSH stimulates adenylyl cyclase in these cells, and forskolin is able to fully reproduce the TSH effect on cell division(13Lamy F. Wilkin F. Baptist M. Posada J. Roger P.P. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8398-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in WRT cells, a cell line derived from rat thyroid, TSH-induced mitogenicity is dependent not only on cAMP but also on Ras via a cAMP-independent pathway(14Kupperman E. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As Ras has been shown previously to stimulate MAP kinase activity in a number of cell types (15Cook S. McCormick F. Nature. 1994; 369: 361-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the question of whether MAP kinase is subject to regulation by TSH remains unanswered. Our present results demonstrate that TSH stimulates MAP kinase in human thyroid follicles.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCollagenase type I, protease type IX, antibiotics-antimycotics, human transferrin, vitamin C, bovine insulin, protein kinase A inhibitor, 8-bromo-cAMP, and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP were from Sigma; tissue culture dishes were from Falcon; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), DMEM/Ham's F-12 culture medium, and fetal calf serum from Life Technologies, Inc.; myelin basic protein peptide substrate of MAP kinase and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies were from UBI; [γ-32P]ATP (1600 Ci/mmol), chemiluminescence reaction kit assay (ECL), and autoradiography films (Hyperfilm MP) were from Amersham Corp.; phosphocellulose filter paper (P-81) from Whatman; nitrocellulose membrane (BA 83) was from Schleicher & Schuell; anti-MAP kinase monoclonal antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories; anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies coupled to peroxidase were from Biosys; and protein G-Sepharose was from Boehringer Mannheim.Bovine TSH (≈25 units/mg) was a generous gift from NIH or was purchased from UCB Bioproducts, Brussels, Belgium (≈40 units/mg) where identified; EGF was from Sigma, and bFGF from Genzyme.Cell Culture and Preparation of Cell ExtractsThe human thyroid tissues were obtained at surgery from patients with non-cancer thyroid diseases. Thyroid follicles were prepared as described (16Roger P.P. Dumont J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and modified as follows; the minced tissues were incubated in DMEM for 90 min at 37°C in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml collagenase type I and 0.9 mg/ml protease type IX. Thyroid follicle sedimentation was more rapid than the other cells present, thus allowing a purification of the thyrocytes. The purification of thyrocytes was verified by electronic microscopy, as described in a previous study(17Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The isolated follicles were seeded in 6-cm tissue culture dishes and cultured for 2 days in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium supplemented with antibiotics-antimycotics, 1.25 μg/ml human transferrin, 40 μg/ml vitamin C, 1% fetal calf serum, and 5 μg/ml bovine insulin. Prior to use in experiments, the follicles were cultured overnight in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented only with antibiotics-antimycotics and 40 μg/ml vitamin C.After stimulation in serum-free media, the culture medium was removed, and the thyrocytes were washed twice with buffer A: 80 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, containing 20 mM EGTA and 15 mM MgCl2. The cells were then harvested, sonicated for 3 s on ice in buffer A containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 mM trypsin inhibitor, 1 mM benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and 1 mM phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (Na3VO4). Homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C at 105,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use.MAP Kinase AssayThe MAP kinase activity was measured by incubation of 2-5 μg of cytosolic proteins for 10 min at 30°C with 1 mM substrate peptide containing the sequence of myelin basic protein phosphorylated by MAP kinase (18Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (APRTPGGRR) in the following buffer: 12.5 mM MOPS and 12.5 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, containing 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml protein kinase A inhibitor, and 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1-3 μCi/nmol). The reaction was stopped by 3% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the sample supernatants were then spotted onto 1-cm2 phosphocellulose filter paper(19Glass D.B. Masarachia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal.

The radioactivity bound to the filters was quantified by liquid scintillation counting.Immunoblotting StudiesProtein samples were prepared in denaturing conditions and were separated by electrophoresis in 8-15% SDS-PAGE, as described(20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar), then blotted (X-blot) onto nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection was performed by incubating the membrane for 3 h with either 1/2,000 diluted anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies or 1/2,000 diluted anti-MAP kinase monoclonal antibodies. After washing of the membrane in buffer B: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, detection of antigen-antibody complexes was performed by further incubation of the membrane with 1/30,000 diluted anti-mouse IgG antibodies coupled to peroxidase for 1 h. After washing once in buffer B, the revelation was performed with the chemiluminescence reaction and autoradiography.Preparation of AntibodiesIgG were purified by affinity chromatography on protein G-Sepharose from either control serum, or serum containing anti-TSH receptor antibodies either (i) stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity (TSAb)(21Orgiazzi J.J. Mornex R. Monte A. The Thyroid Gland. Raven Press, New York1990: 405-495Google Scholar), or (ii) blocking the stimulation by TSH of cAMP production (TBkAb) (22Madec A.M. Clavel S. Stefanutti A. Orgiazzi J. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2062-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in cultured thyroid cells. After concentration, quantification of the IgG was performed by Ouchterlony's radial immunodiffusion technique. The ability of the purified IgG to recognize the TSH receptor was verified by inhibition of the binding of 125I-TSH to purified thyroid membranes.RESULTSIn order to test a possible effect of TSH on MAP kinase in human thyroid, we first performed a kinetic study of MAP kinase activation in primary cultured human thyroid follicles (Fig. 1), prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The stimulation of follicles by 10 nM TSH was followed by an increase in MAP kinase activity, measured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” that reached a maximum of 4-9-fold the basal level after a 20-min stimulation period, depending on the available thyroid gland. This activity then decreased after 60 min to a level, which was approximately half of the maximal activation, and was sustained for at least 3 h. MAP kinase has previously been shown to require tyrosine phosphorylation for its activation(2Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonk N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar); hence, we performed immunoblotting studies of cytosolic proteins with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1B, upper panel). The treatment of thyroid follicles with 10 nM TSH induced the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue of a protein with a molecular mass of 42 kDa (pp42), the apparent molecular mass reported for Erk2. Anti-MAP kinase monoclonal antibodies identified only one isoform of MAP kinase with a molecular mass of 42 kDa in cultured human thyroid cells (Fig. 1B, lowerpanel). It has been reported previously that the electrophoretic mobility of MAP kinase was decreased after its phosphorylation and activation(23Posada J. Sanghera J. Pelech S. Aebersold R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After treatment of thyroid follicles with 10 nM TSH, a significant proportion of the 42-kDa MAP kinase presented the typical shift in mobility following electrophoresis (Fig. 1B, lower panel), the amount of which was correlated with both intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp42 and MAP kinase activity. Moreover, when the immunoblotting studies with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-MAP kinase antibodies were successively performed on the same membrane, the apparent molecular mass of the more slowly migrating MAP kinase was exactly the same as that of pp42. Hence, it would appear that TSH stimulated the activity of p42 MAP kinase in primary cultured human thyroid follicles.Maximal stimulation of p42 MAP kinase activity in response to 10 nM TSH was obtained after 20 min of stimulation. Hence, we performed dose-response assays to TSH at this time point. The maximal MAP kinase activity was obtained with 5 nM TSH (Fig. 2), with a calculated EC50≈ 1.5 nM. This corresponds to a considerably greater TSH concentration (approximately 3-fold more) than that required to produce the EC50 for the stimulation of cAMP production, and the apparent Kd for the high affinity TSH binding site, in human thyroid(8Nagayama Y. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 151-156Google Scholar). These results correlated with those obtained when the cytosolic extracts were submitted to anti-phosphotyrosine and to anti-MAP kinase immunoblotting. To complement the results obtained in the previous experiments with bovine TSH (from NIH), we used another highly purified batch of TSH (from UCB Bioproducts), which elicited a similar stimulation of MAP kinase (not shown).Figure 2:Concentration dependence of the stimulation by TSH of MAP kinase in human thyroid follicles. Cultured human thyroid follicles were treated with TSH for 20 min. The MAP kinase activity was assayed in cytosolic fractions, as in Fig. 1A. Proteins from the same fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (αP-Tyr), as in Fig. 1B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further characterize the mechanism of TSH-mediated MAP kinase activity, we employed two specific antisera, TSAb and TBkAb, which contain antibodies able to specifically stimulate and inhibit, respectively, the TSH receptor. When the stimulation of MAP kinase was evaluated by the shift of the activated p42 in SDS-PAGE, the preincubation of thyroid follicles with 0.3 mg/ml control IgG, TBkAb, or TSAb was not followed by stimulation of MAP kinase (Fig. 3). However, a slight increase in MAP kinase activity (less than 2-fold the control), measured by phosphorylation of substrate peptide, was observed when the follicles were incubated at least 1 h in the presence of TSAb, but not in the presence of TBkAb, as compared to the control (not shown). Although the stimulation of MAP kinase elicited following 20 min of TSH (5 nM) addition was not affected by preincubation of thyroid follicles with control antibodies, it was decreased when preincubation was performed with anti-TSH receptor antibodies (Fig. 3). Corresponding to this result, the stimulation by 5 nM TSH for 20 min of MAP kinase activity was decreased by more than 50% by the preincubation of follicles with anti-TSH receptor antibodies, but not with control antibodies (not shown). The incomplete inhibition of the TSH-mediated stimulation of MAP kinase may be because the titer of the anti-TSH receptor antibodies is too low in comparison with the TSH concentration used for these experiments. Unfortunately, it was not possible to greatly increase the antibody concentration in these experiments, because of the appearance of nonspecific effects.Figure 3:Inhibition by anti-TSH receptor antibodies of the TSH-induced stimulation of MAP kinase in human thyroid follicles. Thyroid follicles were preincubated for 1 h with 0.3 mg/ml IgG purified from normal serum (Control) or from serum containing anti-thyrotropin receptor blocking (TBkAb) or stimulating (TSAb) antibodies. After stimulation of the follicles by 5 nM TSH for 20 min, MAP kinase immunoblots were performed on cytosolic fractions, as in Fig. 1B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)EGF is a growth factor well known to be a mitogenic stimulus to thyroid cells(24Westermark K. Westermark B. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 138: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Roger P.R. Dumont J.E. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The stimulation of MAP kinase activity after a 30-min addition of 5 nM TSH was of the same order of magnitude as that observed after a 10-min addition of 10 nM EGF (Fig. 4). The MAP kinase response to EGF was not decreased by preincubation of thyroid follicles with anti-TSH receptor antibodies (not shown). Moreover, bFGF, known to a major MAP kinase-stimulating factor in a range of cells, and which has been found to be a contaminant in some TSH preparations(26Armelin H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2702-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), had no stimulatory effect on MAP kinase activity in human thyroid follicles (Fig. 4).Figure 4:MAP kinase activity after stimulation of human thyroid follicles by TSH, cAMP, or growth factors. Cytosolic fractions were prepared from human thyroid follicles, unstimulated (Cont.), or stimulated by 5 nM TSH for 30 min, 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP for 30 min, 10 nM EGF for 10 min, or 1 nM bFGF for 10 min. MAP kinase assays were performed on the cytosolic fractions, as described in Fig. 1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Several groups have shown that cAMP can stimulate MAP kinase activity (27Frödin M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As TSH stimulates cAMP production in thyrocytes, we studied whether an increase in cAMP concentration could modulate the MAP kinase activity of cultured follicles. In conditions where TSH strongly stimulated MAP kinase activity, the treatment of follicles for 30 min with 8-bromo-cAMP, a permeant analogue of cAMP that gives a similar stimulation of protein kinase A to that elicited by TSH, had only a slight (≈200% of control) stimulating effect (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, another permeant analogue of cAMP. The maximal effect was reached 20 min after its addition. At this time, the MAP kinase activity increased with the concentration of 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP and reached a plateau (300% of the control) at 1 mM. Neither the treatment of follicles for 15 or 30 min with 10 μM forskolin, a diterpene that directly stimulates adenylyl cyclase, and increased cAMP production to the same extent as TSH, nor the treatment for 1 h with 0.3 or 3 μg/ml cholera toxin, which ADP-ribosylates and inhibits the GTPase activity of Gs, leading to permanent activation of adenylyl cyclase, reproduced the TSH-mediated simulation of MAP kinase activity (not shown).Hormones, which activate MAP kinase through heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, may do so via pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o proteins(5Winitz S. Russell M. Qian N.-X. Gardner A. Dwyer L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G.

Thyroid follicles were pretreated by 0.2 μg/ml pertussis toxin for 3.5 h, which completely ADP-ribosylates the cellular complement of pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o proteins (not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, pertussis toxin, which by itself was able to stimulate the activity of MAP kinase in the absence of agonist by approximately 2-fold, did not inhibit the stimulation by TSH of MAP kinase.Figure 5:Pertussis toxin fails to inhibit TSH-induced stimulation of MAP kinase in human thyroid follicles. Thyroid follicles were pretreated or not with 0.2 mg/ml pertussis toxin for 3 h 30 min. Then, the follicles were stimulated by 5 nM TSH for 20 min. MAP kinase activity and corresponding MAP kinase immunoblot were performed as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONTSH is well known to play a major role not only in the control of thyroid function, but also in the stimulation of thyroid cell proliferation(7Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We show that MAP kinase was stimulated by TSH in cultured human thyroid follicles, since it enhanced with a similar time course and in a correlated manner: (i) the cytosolic activity that phosphorylates a peptide substrate of MAP kinase and (ii) the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 42-kDa protein corresponding to the activated MAP kinase, which presented a typical reduction in electrophoretic mobility (23Posada J. Sanghera J. Pelech S. Aebersold R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, anti-TSH receptor antibodies, but not control antibodies, decreased the response of MAP kinase to TSH.In contrast to our results, in dog thyroid gland, TSH did not stimulate MAP kinase, unlike other mitogens such as EGF or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate(13Lamy F. Wilkin F. Baptist M. Posada J. Roger P.P. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8398-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This might be due to a difference in the proximal coupling of the TSH receptor. Indeed, contrary to what was reported in human thyroid(9Laurent E. Mockel J. Van Sande J. Graff I. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1987; 52: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated in canine thyroid that the TSH receptor was not coupled to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis by a PLC(31Graff I. Mockel J. Laurent E. Erneux C. Dumont J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 210: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation of the absence of stimulation of MAP kinase by TSH in dog thyroid cells would be the TSH receptor being uncoupled from PIP2-PLC. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that, in these cells, carbachol which stimulates PIP2-PLC(31Graff I. Mockel J. Laurent E. Erneux C. Dumont J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 210: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), also stimulates MAP kinase(13Lamy F. Wilkin F. Baptist M. Posada J. Roger P.P. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8398-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the stimulation of PIP2-PLC by TSH involving α-subunits of Gq/11 proteins has been reported in human thyroid(32Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Van Sande J. Spicher K. Schultz G. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13733-13735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have as yet no evidence of its implication in the stimulation of MAP kinase by TSH. Indeed, oncogenic Gqα-subunits mutants, which lack GTPase activity, do not stimulate the MAP kinase cascade when expressed in COS cells(33De Vivo M. Chen J. Codina J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kalinec G. Nazarali A.J. Hermouet S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4687-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas they stimulate efficiently PIP2-PLC(35Qian N.-X. Winitz S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4077-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Another explanation of the discrepant results between canine and human thyroid could be the existence of a different effect of cAMP on the MAP kinase cascade. In some cell types, cAMP has been found to inhibit the stimulation of MAP kinase by growth factors(36Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). It was not reported by Dumont and collaborators whether cAMP could have negative effect on the MAP kinase cascade in canine thyroid. This is probably not the case in human thyroid, since TSH stimulates both MAP kinase and cAMP production. In other cell types cAMP stimulates the MAP kinase cascade (27Frödin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In dog thyroid cells, forskolin and TSH, which are both cAMP-elevating agents, did not stimulate MAP kinase(13Lamy F. Wilkin F. Baptist M. Posada J. Roger P.P. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8398-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human thyroid follicles, we found that, in conditions where TSH produced a robust activation of MAP kinase, neither forskolin nor cholera toxin, which increase cAMP production, nor permeant analogues of cAMP, could stimulate MAP kinase activity at the same extent as TSH. These results suggest that TSH stimulates MAP kinase by a pathway largely independent from that of intracellular cAMP elevation. Furthermore, we have recently reported the expression of TSH receptors and the existence of TSH effects in cultured astroglial cells(37Saunier B. Pierre M. Jacquemin C. Courtin F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1091-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In these cells, TSH stimulated MAP kinase(42Tournier C. Gavaret J.-M. Jacquemin C. Pierre M. Saunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), but neither InsP2-PLC nor cAMP production(37Saunier B. Pierre M. Jacquemin C. Courtin F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1091-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting another signaling pathway could be involved in the pathway from the TSH receptor to the MAP kinase cascade.The mitogenic effect of TSH in the thyroid gland is attributed to the stimulation of cAMP production, via Gs(7Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, in slices of human thyroid gland, TSH-mediated DNA synthesis is only in part explained by an elevation in intracellular cAMP(16Roger P.P. Dumont J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Kupperman and co-workers (14Kupperman E. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have shown in WRT, a cell line derived from rat thyroid, that the cAMP-independent portion of DNA synthesis stimulated by TSH was inhibited by microinjection of dominant negative Ras. The Ras protein is located on the signaling pathway of mitogens which stimulate the MAP kinase cascade(15Cook S. McCormick F. Nature. 1994; 369: 361-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hormones stimulating MAP kinase have been shown to activate Ras, via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins(5Winitz S. Russell M. Qian N.-X. Gardner A. Dwyer L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

In human thyroid follicles, pertussis toxin did not affect the stimulation of MAP kinase by TSH (Fig. 5), suggesting Gi/o proteins were not implicated in this TSH effect. However, it has been shown that Ras-Raf might be activated through heterotrimeric G proteins βγ-subunits (38Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S.

INTRODUCTIONThe transport of proteins and RNAs in both directions across the nuclear envelope constitutes a set of processes called nucleocytoplasmic trafficking(1Forbes D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Both the import of proteins and the export of RNAs occur via the nuclear pore complex. However, the steps responsible for the delivery of substrates to the pore complex, variously referred to as “targeting” and “docking,” differ for protein import and RNA export. For many proteins, the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NLSsnuclear localization signalssnRNAsmall nuclear RNA. that direct the targeting phase of import have been delineated(3Dingwall C.

While most nuclear proteins are imported by a single predominant targeting pathway(9Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. Exp.

In most cases, with the exception of rRNA, which has not been investigated, and tRNA, which appears to have general competitive effects (see below), the saturable step in the export of each RNA is mediated by specific factors.

Thus, the presence of a cap increases mRNA and U snRNA export rates, and free cap dinucleotide inhibits the export of capped RNAs (reviewed in (21Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. Semin.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Beginning with their sequestration within transcriptional and post-transcriptional processing and ribonucleoprotein assembling centers, the transient retention of RNAs within the nucleus is a controlling factor in both the constitutive and regulated export of RNAs(25Legrain P.

RNA-specific nuclear retention mechanisms and virus-induced export blocks also occur (reviewed in (29Krug R. Curr. Biol. 1993; 5: 944-949Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For example, the retention of HLS-DRA mRNA was recently shown to be determined by a signal located in the mRNA's 3′-untranslated region (30Del Pozzo G. Ciullo M. Autiero M. Guardiola J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fabre et al.(31Fabre E. Boelens W.C. Wimmer C. Mattaj I.W. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 275-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) recently discovered a class of pore complex proteins in yeast that bind RNA and could function as general RNA docking sites during the latter stages of RNA targeting to the pore complex.In this study, we show that a saturable factor in 40 S ribosomal subunit export is specific and is not limiting for tRNA export. Also, we present evidence that the rate-limiting step for tRNA export is the dissociation from high affinity retention sites that can be titrated with tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of SubstratesYeast [32P]tRNAPhe was transcribed from a linearized plasmid in vitro using T7 polymerase and [32P]UTP following standard protocols(32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Labeled tRNA was purified through a Sephadex G-25 spin column followed by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and was analyzed on an 8 M urea, 10% polyacrylamide gel to ensure that only full-length tRNA was transcribed. Purified tRNA was resuspended in oocyte injection buffer (10Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) prior to injection.Yeast tRNAPhe (Sigma) was purified by phenol:chloroform and chloroform extractions followed by several ethanol precipitations and was suspended in water. Alternatively, tRNA was purified by extraction from 8 M urea, 10% polyacrylamide gels.32P-Labeled ribosomes were purified from Tetrahymena thermophila grown overnight on phosphate-depleted medium supplemented with 32PO4(33Calzone F.J. Angerer R.C. Gorovsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2145-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted at 5000 × g for 1 min and resuspended in 30 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml heparin, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Cells were vortexed and incubated on ice for 15 min. The homogenate was spun for 10 min to pellet cell debris, and the resulting supernatant was layered over 1 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and centrifuged in a TLA100.2 rotor at 4°C for 36 min at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The ribosome pellet was resuspended in dissociation buffer (50 mM Tris, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2), centrifuged through 10-40% sucrose gradients prepared in the same buffer, and fractionated using a Searle Densi-Flo IIC fractionator linked to an Isco UA5 absorbance monitor. Fractions containing 40 S and 60 S subunits were pooled, and the subunits were pelleted and stored at −80°C. Subunit pellets were resuspended in oocyte injection buffer (10Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) containing 2 mM MgCl2. RNA extracted from the 40 S subunits and analyzed on a 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel reveals one band, corresponding to the 18 S RNA (data not shown). Unlabeled rRNA for use in competition experiments was purified from 40 S or 60 S ribosomal subunits or from polysomes by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.Microinjections and Analysis of ExportInjections were performed on manually defolliculated stage VI oocytes using beveled micropipette needles ∼20 μm in diameter. 20 nl of a solution containing export substrates was injected blindly into nuclei via the animal pole along with enough polyvinylpyrrolidone-stabilized colloidal gold to color the solution bright red. All injected oocytes were held in calcium-free OR-2 medium(10Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For each time point, 15 oocytes were injected. Successful nuclear injections were scored by noting the location of the colloidal gold. On average, 10-13 oocytes out of 15 were injected in their nuclei.Oocytes were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, enucleated, and solubilized in NCS-II (Amersham Corp). Scintillation fluid and glacial acetic acid were added according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and values for percent export were determined by scintillation counting. Intranuclear concentrations of injected materials were calculated assuming a nuclear volume of 40 nl.To verify that export substrates were exiting the nucleus as intact RNAs, oocytes were injected with [32P]tRNA or 32P-labeled 40 S subunits and incubated for 30 min. Injected oocytes were fixed in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and enucleated, and the RNA was extracted from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions as described(10Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Total nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs were analyzed on 8 M urea, 10% polyacrylamide gels or on 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gels, followed by autoradiography.RESULTSThe kinetics of tRNA (12Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6436-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and ribosomal subunit (16Bataillé N. Helser T. Fried H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Khanna-Gupta A. Ware V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1791-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) export from Xenopus oocyte nuclei have been characterized and shown to be saturable. To ensure that we had purified export-competent substrates, we first verified that the export of tRNA and ribosomal subunits was saturable by performing a simple self-competition analysis. In vitro transcribed [32P]tRNAPhe was injected into Xenopus oocyte nuclei, and export was assayed by monitoring the appearance of [32P]tRNA in the cytoplasm. Microinjected tRNAs were stable for the time course of these experiments as indicated by the observations that the total counts/minute/oocyte remained relatively constant over the time course of these experiments and the percent export values obtained by the scintillation counting of whole cytoplasms and nuclei (see “Materials and Methods”) agreed with those obtained by excising acrylamide gel slices containing the nuclear and cytoplasmic [32P]tRNAs. We, like others(13Dargemont C. Kühn L.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), found that nuclear microinjection leads to initial leakage of ∼10-20% of the injected tRNA into the cytoplasm. This phenomenon was peculiar to tRNA as we did not observe leakage of 32P-labeled ribosomal subunits, 125I-bovine serum albumin, or colloidal gold (colored red) following their microinjection.When tRNA was injected to an intranuclear concentration of ∼6 nM, export proceeded as shown in Fig. 1A, with a t½ of ∼30 min (see also (12Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6436-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Self-competition was demonstrated by adding unlabeled yeast tRNAPhe to the injection solution to a final concentration of 60 μM. This competed the percent export of [32P]tRNA to slightly above background levels (∼20%).Analogous results were obtained for the export of 32P-labeled ribosomal subunits (Fig. 1B). 32P-Labeled subunits were purified from T. thermophila grown in the presence of 32PO4. Tetrahymena is a convenient source of ribosomes, and Tetrahymena ribosomes had previously been shown to be exported from Xenopus oocyte nuclei(17Khanna-Gupta A. Ware V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1791-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled 40 S ribosomal subunits (0.07 μM) were exported with a t½ of between 15 and 30 min. The injection of a 10-fold higher concentration of 32P-labeled 40 S subunits resulted in a significantly lower percent export rate, indicative of saturation kinetics (Fig. 1B). As previously shown by others(16Bataillé N. Helser T. Fried H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Khanna-Gupta A. Ware V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1791-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), assessment by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography confirmed that the 32P-labeled 18 S rRNA of microinjected 40 S subunits remained full length in both the nucleus and cytoplasm during the course of these experiments (data not shown).To prepare for competition studies between tRNA and ribosomal subunits, we determined the concentrations required for maximal tRNA and ribosomal subunit self-competition. The concentration of tRNA needed to achieve maximal inhibition of [32P]tRNA export (10 μM; see Fig. 5A) was roughly 20 times higher than the concentration of ribosomal subunits needed to achieve maximal inhibition of 32P-labeled ribosomal subunit export (0.5 μM; data not shown). These concentrations are in accord with previously published results(12Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6436-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Dargemont C.

A, [32P]tRNAPhe was microinjected into oocyte nuclei with increasing concentrations of unlabeled tRNA. Percent export was determined after 20-min incubations. Injection solutions contained 6 nM [32P]tRNAPhe and sufficient unlabeled tRNAPhe to make up the various concentrations. B, shown is the dose dependence of tRNA export in the presence of rRNA. Injections were performed as described for A, except that 1.6 μM rRNA was included in each injection solution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)tRNA Export Is Enhanced by Ribosomal Subunits or rRNADirect competition between the tRNA and ribosomal subunit export pathways was studied by challenging [32P]tRNAPhe export with saturating concentrations of unlabeled 40 S ribosomal subunits. In this experiment, concentrations of 40 S subunits known to maximally compete ribosomal subunit export (see above) were co-injected with 6 nM [32P]tRNAPhe. Unexpectedly, the export of [32P]tRNAPhe was stimulated by co-injection with saturating concentrations of either 40 S subunits (Fig. 2A) or 60 S subunits (data not shown). In no experiment did the presence of excess ribosomal subunits impede the export of [32P]tRNAPhe. We conclude that the limiting factor in the 40 S subunit export pathway is not required for tRNA export. However, the observed stimulation of tRNA export indicates that both tRNA and ribosomal subunits interact with a nuclear component that influences the rate of tRNA export. Microinjection of 1.6 μM rRNA purified from 80 S subunits also stimulated tRNA export (Fig. 2B), suggesting that mature ribosomal subunits are not essential for the stimulation effect (the extent of assembly, if any, of ribosomal proteins onto injected rRNA is unknown).Figure 2:tRNA export is stimulated by co-injection with 40 S ribosomal subunits or purified rRNA. A, in vitro transcribed [32P]tRNAPhe (6 nM) was injected into nuclei of Xenopus laevis oocytes in the absence (⊡) or presence (✦) of 40 S subunits (0.7 μM), and export was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, [32P]tRNAPhe (6 nM) was microinjected into nuclei in the absence (⊡) or presence (✦) of purified ribosomal RNA (1.6 μM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The reciprocal experiment was performed to test the effect of saturating concentrations of tRNA on 32P-labeled 40 S subunit export. As shown in Fig. 3, 1.6 μM rRNA had a large inhibitory effect on 32P-labeled 40 S subunit export that is consistent with competition. Although tRNA export was not inhibited by saturating concentrations of 40 S subunits or rRNA (Fig. 2), the export of 32P-labeled 40 S subunits was partially inhibited by concentrations of tRNA (60 μM) that effectively compete [32P]tRNA export. This argues that the partial inhibition of 32P-labeled 40 S subunit export is not due to competition for the same factor that is limiting for tRNA export. Rather, this weak effect may be indirect, artifactual, or indicative of another shared intermediate. Partial inhibition of tRNA and mRNA export by similar high concentrations of homopolymeric competitor RNAs was observed by Jarmolowski et al.(14Jarmolowski A. Boelens W.C. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Figure 3:Effects of tRNA on 40 S subunit export. The export of 0.07 μM32P-labeled 40 S subunits was assayed in the absence (⊡) or presence of tRNA (✦) or rRNA (⬠). Export was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Stimulation of tRNA Export by Ribosomal Subunits Depends on the Intranuclear Concentration of Subunits and Not on Their Export FluxOne explanation for the stimulation of tRNA export by co-injected ribosomal subunits and rRNA is that a fraction of the microinjected [32P]tRNAPhe is exported as a tRNA-40 S subunit complex via the ribosome-specific export pathway in addition to the fraction exported via the tRNA-specific pathway. To test this, we examined the dose dependence of the effect at concentrations of 40 S subunits ranging from 0.035 to 1.5 μM. If the enhancement of tRNA export was due to transport along the subunit export pathway, then the effect should plateau when the rate of subunit export reaches Vmax. This should occur at ∼0.5 μM 40 S subunits. Fig. 4 shows that the extent of tRNA export stimulation was roughly proportional to the concentration of co-injected 40 S subunits. This was true for 40 S subunit concentrations well in excess of those needed to saturate 40 S subunit export. Thus, the stimulation of tRNA export by co-injected 40 S subunits is not related to the absolute rate of 40 S subunit export, but instead to the intranuclear concentration of 40 S subunits. Models that involve an intranuclear association between ribosomal subunits and tRNA are currently under investigation.Figure 4:[32P]tRNAPhe export as a function of 40 S subunit concentration. The export of microinjected [32P]tRNAPhe (6 nM) was assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled 40 S subunits. In each case, injected oocytes were incubated for 20 min. Maximal inhibition of ribosomal subunit export occurs at 0.5 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)tRNA Export Rate Is Limited by Titratable Retention SitesThe stimulation of tRNA export by 40 S subunits is consistent with the presence of titratable intranuclear RNA-binding sites that limit the rate of tRNA export by restricting access to the tRNA-specific export apparatus. The experiments described above indicate that 40 S subunits can compete with tRNA for these sites. We postulate that in the presence of excess 40 S subunits, the sites become filled, and a larger fraction of tRNA is free to interact with the export apparatus. These experiments cannot, however, distinguish whether the association of tRNA with the retention sites occurs before or after the tRNA-specific step. In any case, this model predicts that tRNA itself would be able to titrate the putative retention sites under the following conditions. If the affinity of tRNA for the retention sites is higher than the affinity of tRNA for its saturable export receptor, then the injection of increasing concentrations of tRNA (at subsaturating concentrations) should stimulate tRNA export. As shown in Fig. 5A, this was found to be true at tRNA concentrations up to 2 μM, after which tRNA export became saturated. While the absolute level of [32P]tRNAPhe export varied among batches of oocytes, the appearance of a spike in the export curve at lower tRNA concentrations was reproducible.The observation that tRNA stimulates its own export does not address whether tRNA and rRNA stimulate export by the same mechanism. To investigate whether the stimulation of tRNA export by rRNA and tRNA is the result of titrating the same or different retention sites, we repeated the tRNA dose-dependence experiment in the presence of saturating concentrations of rRNA. As shown in Fig. 5B, co-injection of rRNA stimulated tRNA export and abolished the spike. We interpret this to mean that the stimulation of tRNA export by increasing concentrations of tRNA was precluded by the saturation of common retention sites with co-injected rRNA. This result indicates that both tRNA and rRNA stimulate tRNA export by titrating a common set of retention sites.DISCUSSIONThe kinetic results described provide insight into two intermediates along the tRNA export pathway. First, the saturable intermediate in the ribosome export pathway is not limiting for tRNA export. This suggests that tRNA and ribosomal subunit export pathways contain at least one distinct step. Second, the kinetics indicate that the rate-limiting step in tRNA export is a transient association with intranuclear retention sites. The titration of these sites increases instead of competes the rate of tRNA export. The first finding extends the work of Jarmolowski et al.(14Jarmolowski A. Boelens W.C. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), who reported that RNA type-specific factors are involved in the export of tRNA, mRNA, and snRNAs. It may turn out that the export of each type of RNA, including tRNA, rRNA, U snRNA, signal recognition particle RNA, and mRNA, is mediated by at least one specific transport factor, although common intermediates, such as those associated with the nuclear pore complex will probably be shared. Ordering and characterizing each intermediate along the targeting and translocation pathways of different RNAs is an important challenge. It is relevant to note that the import of certain U small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles appears to be mediated by specific factor(s) that are distinct from those employed during the import of most nuclear proteins(9Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The idea that nuclear transport can be regulated by retention is not a new idea. NLS anchoring in the cytoplasm is an established mechanism for regulated protein import(1Forbes D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Also, intranuclear retention has been proposed to be a general mechanism for controlling the export of proteins from nuclei(34Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Dargemont C. Kühn L.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 493-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Beginning with the initiation of transcription and proceeding through their processing and maturation, nascent RNAs are associated with large intranuclear structures, including nucleoli and speckles (reviewed in (36Spector D.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 265-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the localization of RNAs in supramolecular assemblies precludes their free diffusion and functions to retain immature RNAs in the nucleus (but see (35Zachar Z. Kramer J.I. Mims P. Bingham P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Examples of RNA-specific retention during normal cell growth and in viral infections are documented(29Krug R. Curr. Biol. 1993; 5: 944-949Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the case of tRNA export, Haselbeck and Greer (27Haselbeck R.C. Greer C.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8575-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) recently showed that microinjected intron-containing tRNAs were retained in the oocyte nucleus, while spliced tRNAs were exported.In this study, evidence for transient RNA retention came from experiments that suggest the existence of an intermediate that normally functions to limit the rate of tRNA export. According to this model, when subsaturating concentrations of tRNA are microinjected into nuclei, the concentration of free tRNA that is accessible to the export apparatus is determined by the Kd of tRNA for a limiting set of intranuclear retention sites. As the retention sites become filled with increasing concentrations of injected tRNA, a higher proportion of the injected tRNA will be unbound and free to be exported, hence the stimulation. Because the range of tRNA concentrations over which stimulation of transport occurs is less than half that needed to significantly compete tRNA export (Fig. 5), we conclude that the affinity of tRNA for the retention sites is higher than for the saturable factor.Because saturating concentrations of 40 S subunits and rRNA stimulate rather than compete tRNA export, we conclude that tRNA export does not employ the saturable factor(s) that is required for ribosome export. In the converse experiment, in which 40 S subunit export was challenged with saturating concentrations of tRNA, a different result was obtained. Here, high concentrations of tRNA partially compete the rate of 40 S subunit export. Previously, Dargemont and Kühn (13Dargemont C. Kühn L.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported that tRNA competed the export of mRNA, and subsequently, Jarmolowski et al.(14Jarmolowski A. Boelens W.C. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) showed that tRNA inhibited the rate of mRNA export, but only at relatively high concentrations. Although more analysis is needed, the simplest explanation for these data is that nonphysiologically high concentrations of microinjected tRNA bind in a pseudospecific (low affinity) fashion with factors that normally bind with physiologically high affinities to mRNA and 40 S subunits. Pseudospecific competitive inhibition would also explain the observed inhibition of tRNA and mRNA export by high concentrations of homopolymeric RNAs(14Jarmolowski A. Boelens W.C. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We cannot, however, rule out the interpretation that the effect of high concentrations of tRNA on mRNA and rRNA export indicates a common transport intermediate.The putative intranuclear retention sites can be titrated with a range of different RNA substrates. Thus, tRNA, 40 S ribosomes, and total rRNA were each able to stimulate the percent rate of tRNA export. We also found that at 20 min post-injection, 5′-m7GpppG-capped mRNA (8 μM) stimulated tRNA export to a statistically significant extent (125 ± 0.8% of control tRNA export in four experiments). Bovine serum albumin (20 μM) and double-stranded pBR322 DNA (1 μM) had no statistically significant effect. In the future, the tRNA export stimulation assay will provide a quantitative means to assess the specificity of the sites for different RNAs.What are these intranuclear RNA retention sites? At one extreme, we cannot rule out that microinjected RNAs bind artifactually to sites that are normally inaccessible to endogenously transcribed and processed RNAs. However, the fact that the putative retention sites titrate at lower tRNA concentrations than those required to compete tRNA export argues that they are specific. The sites might represent component(s) of the normal transcriptional and post-transcriptional retention mechanisms. A more provocative explanation draws on a potential parallel between protein import and RNA export. During protein import, the binding of NLS-containing proteins to cytoplasmic NLS receptors is believed to be the saturable step(1Forbes D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step for protein import occurs after the substrate is targeted to the pore complex and is commonly assumed to involve some intermediate during the translocation process(37Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1988; 52: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). NLS-containing proteins, adsorbed to colloidal gold particles, have been observed to cluster about nuclear pore complex-associated filaments that extend into the cytoplasm(37Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1988; 52: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 38Scheer Y. Dabauvalle M.-C. Merkert H. Benevente R. Feldherr C.M. Nucleocytoplasmic Transport. Academic Press, New York1988: 5-25Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that these perinuclear docking sites are general karyophile-binding sites and represent a later step along the import pathway of most nuclear proteins.The results presented here provide kinetic evidence that tRNA export, like protein import, has different saturable and rate-limiting steps. The saturable step is tRNA-specific, whereas the rate-limiting step is common to tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA. The rate-limiting step, which we postulate involves dissociation from retention sites, might represent pore complex-associated RNA-binding sites. Unfortunately, these kinetic experiments provide no insight as to the intranuclear location of the RNA retention sites or as to whether they occur prior to or after pore complex targeting. In analogy to the putative cytoplasmic docking filaments, Fabre et al.(31Fabre E. Boelens W.C. Wimmer C. Mattaj I.W. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 275-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) recently presented evidence for the presence of general RNA-binding proteins at the nuclear pore complex. Specifically, the yeast nucleoporin Nup145p is a member of a family of pore complex proteins, is required for mRNA export, and binds specifically to poly(G) RNA. The authors propose that RNAs transiently associate with these RNA-binding proteins during export. We think it is an attractive hypothesis that access of substrates to the pore complex is restricted at both faces by substrate docking sites that serve to regulate access to the translocation apparatus.This model predicts that mature tRNAs are released from their processing components and become associated with the nuclear envelope. Here, they transiently bind general RNA docking sites. Release from these sites to the translocation channel is rate-limiting for tRNA. Titration of the retention sites with microinjected tRNA, mRNA, or rRNA allows unbound tRNAs to bypass the rate-limiting step and directly access the translocation channel. Under these conditions, export is still limited by the availability of saturable export factors that are specific for tRNA export.There is no kinetic evidence for titratable retention sites that limit the rate of protein import or, for that matter, any transport substrate other than tRNA. This does not rule out the existence of such sites because kinetic evidence is only obtainable under certain conditions. Specifically, stimulation of transport by the titration of retention sites would be apparent only if the retention sites became titrated at substrate concentrations that are lower than those needed to saturate the substrate-specific export factors. If the substrate competes transport at substrate concentrations that are lower than those that would titrate the retention sites, then any stimulatory effects would be masked by prior competition. In this regard, tRNA export may be unique in that the process becomes saturated at concentrations in excess of those needed to show stimulation. Thus, while retention sites may be a general phenomenon in nuclear import and export, their existence may not always be revealed using the transport stimulation criterion. INTRODUCTIONThe transport of proteins and RNAs in both directions across the nuclear envelope constitutes a set of processes called nucleocytoplasmic trafficking(1Forbes D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Both the import of proteins and the export of RNAs occur via the nuclear pore complex. However, the steps responsible for the delivery of substrates to the pore complex, variously referred to as “targeting” and “docking,” differ for protein import and RNA export.

Protein import can also be negatively controlled by cytoplasmic retention or NLS masking(1Forbes D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). While most nuclear proteins are imported by a single predominant targeting pathway(9Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), certain U small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles are targeted to the pore complex by a distinct mechanism(10Michaud N.

In most cases, with the exception of rRNA, which has not been investigated, and tRNA, which appears to have general competitive effects (see below), the saturable step in the export of each RNA is mediated by specific factors. Mutagenesis studies indicate that the cis-acting signals that direct the export of tRNA(12Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the 5′-m7GpppN cap of RNA polymerase II transcripts does not appear to be essential for export(15He X.-P. Bataillé N. Fried H.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 903-912PubMed Google Scholar, 18Terns M.P. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it probably does serve as a key enhancer of export. Thus, the presence of a cap increases mRNA and U snRNA export rates, and free cap dinucleotide inhibits the export of capped RNAs (reviewed in (21Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but see (18Terns M.P. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Beginning with their sequestration within transcriptional and post-transcriptional processing and ribonucleoprotein assembling centers, the transient retention of RNAs within the nucleus is a controlling factor in both the constitutive and regulated export of RNAs(25Legrain P.

RNA-specific nuclear retention mechanisms and virus-induced export blocks also occur (reviewed in (29Krug R. Curr. Biol. 1993; 5: 944-949Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For example, the retention of HLS-DRA mRNA was recently shown to be determined by a signal located in the mRNA's 3′-untranslated region (30Del Pozzo G. Ciullo M. Autiero M. Guardiola J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fabre et al.(31Fabre E. Boelens W.C. Wimmer C. Mattaj I.W. Hurt E.C.

Also, we present evidence that the rate-limiting step for tRNA export is the dissociation from high affinity retention sites that can be titrated with tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2000480897,"In the eukaryotic cell, DNA synthesis is initiated by DNA primase associated with DNA polymerase α. The eukaryotic primase is composed of two subunits, p49 and p58, where the p49 subunit contains the catalytic active site. Mutagenesis of the cDNA for the p49 subunit was initiated to demonstrate a functional correlation of conserved residues among the eukaryotic primases and DNA polymerases. Fourteen invariant charged residues in the smaller catalytic mouse primase subunit, p49, were changed to alanine. These mutant proteins were expressed, purified, and enzymatically characterized for primer synthesis. Analyses of the mutant proteins indicate that residues 104-111 are most critical for primer synthesis and form part of the active site. Alanine substitution in residues Glu105, Asp109, and Asp111 produced protein with no detectable activity in direct primase assays, indicating that these residues may form part of a conserved carboxylic triad also observed in the active sites of DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases. All other mutant proteins showed a dramatic decrease in catalysis, while mutation of two residues, Arg162 and Arg163, caused an increase in Km(NTP). Analysis of these mutant proteins in specific assays designed to separately investigate dinucleotide formation (initiation) and elongation of primer indicates that these two activities utilize the same active site within the p49 subunit. Finally, mutations in three active site codons produced protein with reduced affinity with the p58 subunit, suggesting that p58 may interact directly with active site residues.

INTRODUCTIONDNA primase initiates DNA replication by the synthesis of small ribonucleotides called primers(1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd. Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 275-298Google Scholar). The mammalian primases are composed of two subunits, p49 and p58, which purify as a complex tightly bound to DNA polymerase α(2Conaway R.C. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 3Kaguni L.S. Rossignol J.-M. Conaway R.C. Banks G.R. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9037-9039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wang T.S.-F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The tight association of primase with DNA polymerase α implicates the DNA polymerase α as the lagging-strand DNA polymerase in replication(1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd. Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 275-298Google Scholar, 4Wang T.S.-F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In the in vitro SV40 replication system, DNA polymerase α elongates the RNA primer to complete the synthesis of Okazaki fragment(5Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 197-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Okazaki fragments are then extended by either DNA polymerase δ or ε, allowing DNA polymerase α-primase to recycle and initiate another Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand(6Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This essential role of the DNA polymerase α-primase makes it a key component for regulation and inhibition of the initiation of DNA replication.One unique property of primases (as well as RNA polymerases) is the ability to synthesize nucleotides de novo on a template by the formation of an initial dinucleotide. Primase initiates synthesis with a triphosphate purine moiety at the 5′-end(7Tseng B.Y. Erikson J.M. Goulian M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Shioda M.

Chem. 1984; 259: 9479-9486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively few errors are made during the formation of the dinucleotide, whereas the primase readily misincorporates ribonucleotides during elongation of this dinucleotide(10Sheaff R.J. Kuchta R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After synthesis of 7-10 ribonucleotides, the primer-template is translocated intramolecularly to the active site of the DNA polymerase α subunit(12Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sheaff R.J. Kuchta R.D. Ilsley D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The mechanism of dinucleotide and primer formation by primase is not well understood but may be similar to the mechanism utilized by DNA polymerases. Even less is known about the functional roles of specific amino acids within the primase subunits. Superimposition of the derived polymerase crystal structures of the Klenow fragment, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase and DNA polymerase β demonstrates that, although there is little amino acid homology between such diverged polymerases, the overall folding in the active sites is conserved, bringing certain key residues into the correct position for catalysis or substrate binding(14Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 15Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.C.

Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These key residues are highly conserved in nearly all DNA and RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases, making up motifs A, B, and C (18Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Central to these three motifs are the aspartic and glutamic acids, which make up a catalytic triad within the structures(14Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments on DNA polymerases demonstrate the importance of these residues in metal binding and catalysis(19Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11028-11040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the eukaryotic DNA primases do not display any obvious amino acid sequence similarity to motifs A, B, and C in the DNA polymerases, it is reasonable to propose that the active site of the primases will fold similarly to those of the DNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, and T7 RNA polymerase. Hence, it would be valuable to identify critical amino acid residues in the DNA primase that may make up the equivalent of motifs A, B, and C. This identification would also help to define structural elements responsible for the low fidelity observed with the primases compared with the higher fidelity of DNA polymerases.Analysis of the recombinant mouse primase subunits demonstrates that both subunits are required for initiation while only the smaller subunit is necessary for elongation(12Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the smaller subunit of the yeast primase complex appears to be sufficient for primer synthesis(21Santocanale C. Foiani M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1343-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be the consequence of the expression and purification procedures used or may represent a difference between species. Indeed, the mouse subunits do not complement temperature-sensitive and deletion alleles of the yeast primase genes(22Santocanale C. Locati F. Falconi M.M. Piseri A. Tseng B.Y. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been shown with both the yeast and mouse that the larger subunit stabilizes the activity of the p49 subunit(12Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Santocanale C. Foiani M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1343-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps, the higher mammalian primase subunits require this stabilization for initiation.Amino acid alignment between the yeast (23Plevani P. Francesconi S. Lucchini G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7975-7989Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the mouse p49 reveals a 34% identity, where the greatest similarity occurs in the N-terminal half of the two proteins(24Prussak C.E. Almazan M.T. Tseng B.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4957-4963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This homology shows five regions of highly conserved amino sequences(24Prussak C.E. Almazan M.T. Tseng B.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4957-4963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several temperature-sensitive mutants in the primase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were generated, and their mutations were determined to be in close proximity to or within these conserved regions(25Francesconi S. Longhese M.P. Piseri A. Santocanale C. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3877-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Yeast cells carrying these mutant alleles have reduced primase activity and display a hyper-recombination and mutator phenotype, similar to other DNA replication mutants(26Longhese M.P. Jovine L. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Genetics. 1993; 133: 183-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).On the basis of the homology between the yeast and mouse p49 primase subunits, we have generated a series of site-specific mutations in invariant charged amino acids in the mouse primase. Enzymatic characterization of these mutant proteins showed many of these charged residues to be critical for primer synthesis. We discuss the roles of these residues in the context of the two activities of primases, initiation and elongation of the primer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsNickle nitriloacetic acid cross-linked to agarose was purchased from Qiagen Inc. Glutathione-Sepharose, calf intestine phosphatase, poly(dT)272, poly(dC)423, oligo(A)8-12, and ultrapure NTPs and dNTPs were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [α-3232P]dATP, [α-3232P]dGTP, [α-3232P]ATP, and [α-3232P]GTP were purchased from DuPont NEN. All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA synthesizer. A Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with the program ImageQuant was used for all quantitation of radioactivity in gels.MutagenesisThe 1254-base pair BamHI fragment from pQE9/p49 (12Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into M13mp18 for generating single-stranded closed circular DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described in (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar). Mutant inserts were fully sequenced on one strand. Mutant p49 inserts from M13 RF DNA were ligated into pQE9 (Qiagen Inc.), which had been digested with BamHI and treated with calf intestine phosphatase. Plasmids containing the mutant insert where checked for the mutation either by double-stranded sequencing or by the presence of the new restriction site introduced through mutagenesis.Expression and Purification of ProteinsThe histidine-tagged p49 (H-p49) and p58 (H-p58) subunits were expressed and purified as described in (12Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of the mouse primase subunits as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (GST-p49 and GST-p58), the 1254-base pair BamHI restriction fragment of the mouse p49 subunit was ligated into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). The 1500-base pair BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the mouse p58 subunit was ligated into pGEX-3X (Pharmacia), digested with BamHI and EcoRI for expression as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Expression and purification of the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were carried out essentially as described(28Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). The single-subunit human DNA polymerase α (p180) was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described(20Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol.

Bound protein was eluted with a linear 0-200 mM KCl gradient in buffer A, and 0.25-ml fractions were collected. Protein fractions were detected by A280 absorbance and verified by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin. followed by silver staining. KCl concentrations in the fractions were determined by conductivity measurements.Subunits Interaction AssayThe interaction of p58 and p49 was tested using differentially tagged proteins. Six micrograms of GST-p58 were added to 4.4 μg of H-p49 protein (wild-type or mutant) in 150 μl of binding buffer (500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA). Proteins were incubated on ice for 30 min followed by the addition of 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. After 10 min on ice, the beads were washed 3 times in 1 ml of binding buffer without BSA by quick spin and aspiration. Beads were washed once more in Tris-buffered saline before adding an equal volume of 2 × protein loading dye (2% SDS, 2%β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 125 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, and 10 ng/ml bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled 5 min and loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized in the gel by Coomassie Blue staining.Thermostability AssayThe thermostabilities of the mutant p49 primase subunits were tested by the thermolysin assay as described by Polesky et al.(19Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One microgram of p49 protein in the absence of p58 was incubated with 20 ng of thermolysin (Sigma) in a 30-μl reaction volume containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol at the following temperatures: 4, 16, 25, 30, 37, 42, 48, 55, and 65°C. After 15 min, the samples were boiled in SDS protein sample buffer and loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with silver to visualize the digested proteins.Coupled Primase-Polymerase AssayPrimase activity was tested in the coupled assay using either poly(dT) or poly(dC) as template as described(12Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four picomoles each of p49 (wild-type or mutant), p58, and human p180 were combined in a 30-μl reaction containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 200 μg/ml acetylated BSA, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM either ATP or GTP, 25 μM either [α-3232P]dATP or [α-3232P]dGTP, and 20 μg/ml either poly(dT) or poly(dC). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30°C before adding 1 ml of stop solution (0.5 N NaOH, 44 mg/ml sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μg/ml carrier DNA, and 0.5 mg/ml BSA) and 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. DNA was allowed to precipitate on ice and filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, washed with 1 N HCl and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Control reactions containing only p180 and p58 produced no measurable activity over background.Steady-state KineticsSteady-state kinetic parameters were determined from gel analysis of products using poly(dC) as template. One pmol of p49•p58 complex was added to a 10-μl reaction containing 0.2 μg poly(dC), 4 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml acetylated BSA, 4 mM dithiothreitol, and varying concentrations of [α-3232P]GTP (0.05-1.5 mM). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30°C before quenching on ice followed by the addition of an equal volume of 95% formamide loading dye. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and 3 μl were separated through a 15% sequencing gel. The full spectrum of products in the gel was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Three microliters of a 50 μM [α-3232P]GTP reaction mix containing no enzyme was loaded onto the gel for the last 5 min and used as a standard for quantitating the picomoles of product formed.Primer Elongation AssayThe extension of oligo(A)(12-18)-primed poly(dT) was assayed essentially as described(12Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligo(A)(12-18), 250 pmol, was annealed to 84 pmol of poly(dT)272 in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl. Five pmol (with respect to oligo(A)) of this annealed primer template was added to a 10-μl reaction containing 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml acetylated BSA, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM MgCl2, 900 μM [α-3232P]ATP, and 0.5 pmol of p49 protein. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30°C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 95% formamide sequencing dye. Samples were boiled, and 3 μl were separated through an 18% sequencing gel. The gel was then subjected to autoradiography and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager.Dinucleotide Product AnalysisDinucleotides were synthesized by the wild-type and mutant primase complexes using a (ATC)13 template in the presence of [α-3232P]ATP and GTP. One picomole of primase complex was incubated in a 10-μl reaction containing 0.4 μg of (ATC)13 template, 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml acetylated BSA, and 4 mM dithiothreitol with varying concentrations of GTP (0.05-1.5 mM) and [α-3232P]ATP (0.05-1.5 mM). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30°C and then terminated by heating at 70°C for 5 min. One microliter containing 0.6 units of calf intestine phosphatase, 50 mM Tris acetate, 50 mM magnesium acetate, and 250 mM potassium acetate was added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, followed by the addition of an equal volume of 95% formamide loading dye. Samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a 1 mm × 15 cm × 20 cm 20% sequencing gel. The bromphenol blue was allowed to migrate 10 cm into the gel before it was stopped, and the wet gel was subjected to autoradiography and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Three microliters of a 250 μM [α-3232P]ATP reaction mix containing no enzyme was loaded onto the gel for the last 5 min and used as a standard for quantitating the pmol of product formed.RESULTSAnalysis of the amino acid sequence homology between the mouse, human, and S. cerevisiae catalytic primase subunit reveals five conserved regions (Fig. 1) containing numerous charged residues. Of these residues, 14 are found within clusters of conserved amino acids in regions IV and V(24Prussak C.E. Almazan M.T. Tseng B.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4957-4963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Miyazawa H. Izumi M. Tada S. Takada R. Masutani M. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8111-8122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the locations of these residues within the p49 sequence. These 14 charged residues were changed to alanine to address their role in primer synthesis. Mutations were screened by dideoxy sequence analysis and by the presence of the new restriction site. Mutant and wild-type p49 proteins were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as histidine-tagged proteins (H-p49). Fig. 2 shows a Coomassie-stained gel of the purified p49 mutants as well as the mouse p58 and human p180 subunits used throughout this study. These mutant proteins had the same apparent molecular weight as the wild-type p49 and were more than 90% homogeneous.Figure 2:SDS-PAGE analysis of mutant 49 subunits. Coomassie Blue stained gel of the purified wild-type and mutant p49 subunits. Also shown are the mouse p58 subunit and single subunit human DNA polymerase α (p180) used in the assays throughout this work. Approximately 0.5-2 μg of protein were loaded in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Subunit InteractionInitiation of primer synthesis requires the interaction of the larger primase subunit, p58, with p49. The first question we addressed is whether the alanine substitutions can disrupt the subunit interface between the p49 and p58. To test this affinity, we expressed the primase subunits as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (GST-p49 and GST-p58, Fig. 3, lanes1 and 2, respectively). These GST-p58 and GST-p49 fusion proteins were active in primase assays when the respective H-p49 and H-p58 subunits were added (data not shown). The subunit interaction was tested by mixing GST-p58 and H-p49 proteins followed by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that H-p49 protein bound weakly to the glutathione-Sepharose matrix. Thus, a stringent wash containing 500 mM NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 was needed to reduce the binding of H-p49 with the glutathione-Sepharose matrix (Fig. 3, lanes1 and 3). Under these high salt conditions, the wild-type and most of the mutant proteins bound the p59 subunit. However, mutant proteins D105A, E148A, and D149A had a reduced association for the p58 subunit (Fig. 3, lanes7, 13, and 14). A reverse assay, in which GST-p58 and H-p49 were precipitated with nickle nitriloacetic acid-agarose beads, showed similar results with D105A, E148A, and D149A proteins, while the rest of the mutant proteins bound GST-p58 like the wild-type p49 (data not shown), demonstrating that these three mutant proteins had reduced affinity with the p58 subunit as compared with the wild-type p49.Figure 3:Interaction of p58 with wild-type and mutant p49 subunits. Coomassie-stained gel containing co-precipitated GST-p58 protein with bound wild-type and mutant H-p49 subunits. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were mixed with preformed samples and washed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Beads were then boiled in SDS sample buffer and loaded onto a 9% SDS-PAGE gel. Protein combinations that were mixed with the glutathione-Sepharose beads are listed on top of each lane of the gel. Lanes1-3 are control samples. GST-p49 (68 kDa) and H-p49 (49 kDa) were precipitated in lane1 to show that only the GST-p49 binds the glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST-p58 (82 kDa) was precipitated in lane2, while H-p49 was precipitated in lane3 with the glutathione-Sepharose beads to show nonspecific binding. Samples in lanes4-18 were co-precipitated with the GST-p58 protein where lane4 contains the wild-type p49. H-p49 signifies the histidine-tagged p49 protein while GST- signifies the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DNA Binding AffinityBecause initial screening of the alanine mutant proteins revealed several mutant proteins with little or no activity (see below), we utilized a physical assay over an enzymatic one to probe DNA binding. This affinity was tested by the interaction of the p49 subunit with single-stranded DNA cellulose. Fifty to one hundred micrograms of wild-type or mutant protein were loaded onto a single-stranded DNA cellulose column and eluted with a linear 0-200 mM KCl gradient. The results of this assay demonstrated that all the mutant proteins co-eluted at the same concentration of KCl, 100 mM, as did the wild-type protein. Fig. 4 shows an example of the elution profile for the wild-type and E105A proteins.Figure 4:DNA binding assay. Elution profile of wild-type and E105A p49 subunits from single-stranded DNA cellulose. Shown are silver-stained gels of the eluted fractions from the wild-type (top) and E105A protein (bottom). The scale on the left shows the migration of the molecular weight standards. The heavyline represents the KCl concentration at that particular fraction according to the rightscale where the arrow represents 100 mM KCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ThermostabilityIn addition to the DNA binding assay, a thermostability assay was also utilized to test large structural changes. Mutant and wild-type proteins were treated with thermolysin as a function of increasing temperature and degradation patterns analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described(19Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay probes for structural changes in the mutant proteins by testing the availability of proteolytic sites in the protein as a function of temperature. Thus, if a mutation caused a global structural change in the protein, then it may start to denature at a lower temperature, exposing protease sites differently as compared with the wild-type. All mutant proteins displayed similar proteolysis patterns by thermolysin compared with wild-type at a given temperature, indicating that the mutant proteins retained the same overall structural geometry as that of the wild-type (data not shown).Activity Profile of Mutant ProteinsWild-type and mutant p49 proteins were initially screened for activity using the coupled primase-polymerase assay(12Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of labeled deoxynucleotide was measured on poly(dT) and poly(dC) homopolymers in the presence of the single subunit human DNA polymerase α and the recombinant mouse p58 subunit. This assay is highly sensitive for primer formation since the DNA polymerase amplifies the incorporated label. However, one requirement is that primers be long enough to be recognized by the DNA polymerase α. Fig. 5 illustrates the relative activity in this coupled reaction by the mutant proteins and wild-type. Incorporation of dGTP in the wild-type reaction was about 2-fold higher than dATP incorporation, 910 pmol/h versus 480 pmol/h, respectively. This could be a consequence of DNA polymerase α's affinity for dGTP and dATP or a real difference in primer synthesis by the primase since the eukaryotic primases prefer poly(dC) over poly(dT) (31Roth Y.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Most all mutant proteins synthesized primers more efficiently on poly(dC). In fact, many of the mutant proteins did not show any significant incorporation on poly(dT). The exceptions were the E148A and D149A, mutant proteins that incorporated more label with poly(dT) as template than with poly(dC). The D114A mutant displayed the largest difference in template preference showing a low but detectable level of activity on poly(dT) but near wild-type level of activity on poly(dC). Activity by the K130A mutant was similar with both templates. The D111A mutant had no measurable activity over background, while E105A and D109A had less than 1% activity relative to wild-type.Figure 5:Coupled primase-polymerase assay on poly(dT) and poly(dC).

Some changes within and around this dinucleotide were recognized by the protein. RepB nicked and closed supercoiled pMV158 DNA, having an optimum activity at 60°C. We have imitated, in vitro, a process of rolling circle replication, since RepB was able to nick (initiation) and to covalently close (termination) single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the protein cleavage sequence.

The current model for plasmid leading strand replication is mainly based on pT181 and related plasmids (Rasooly and Novick, 1993; Rasooly et al., 1994) and involves various stages: (i) a dimer of the plasmid-encoded initiator of replication (Rep) protein binds to the plasmid DNA at a specific region in the double strand origin, dso (Wang et al., 1993); (ii) one Rep subunit cleaves the plasmid (+) strand by introducing a thyrosil phosphodiester covalent bond at a specific DNA sequence (Thomas et al., 1990); (iii) the Rep-generated nick leaves a free 3′-OH end, which is extended by host proteins that use the(-) strand as a template and displace the parental nicked (+) strand; (iv) the replisome reaches the reconstituted dso and extends several more nt; and (v) the newly synthesized strand is closed by the unused Rep monomer through at least three nucleophylic DNA-protein-DNA attacks, leaving a short oligonucleotide covalently bound to the attacking Rep monomer. Thus, the final DNA products of plasmid leading-strand replication are one dsDNA molecule and one ssDNA intermediate (te Riele et al., 1986). One distinctive feature of this model is that the Rep protein cannot be reused after each round of replication since the final protein configuration is a heterodimer composed of an intact Rep moiety and an inactive Rep-oligonucleotide subunit (Rasooly and Novick, 1993). rolling circle double-stranded nucleotide(s) single-stranded base pair(s) high performance liquid chromatography. Plasmid pMV158 is a 5536-bp multicopy natural promiscuous replicon that is the prototype of a family of RC-plasmids isolated from several eubacteria (del Solar and Espinosa, 1992; del Solar et al., 1993a). Various genes have been identified as being involved in conjugative mobilization (mob), tetracycline resistance (tet), and replication and its control (repB, copG, rnaII; Fig. 1). This latter region has been characterized in some depth for plasmid pLS1 (a Δmob derivative of pMV158; del Solar et al., 1993a, and references therein). The Rep proteins of the pMV158 family share conserved motifs with plasmid-encoded Tra and Mob proteins as well as with Rep proteins of RC-plasmids, ss coliphages, and geminiviruses (Pansegrau and Lanka, 1991; Ilyina and Koonin, 1992). However, the DNA sequence at the dso of the pMV158-plasmid family has no known homology with other replicons (del Solar et al., 1993a). Initiation of pMV158 replication is mediated by RepB protein (24.2 kDa), which has been shown to introduce a specific nick between nt 448 (G) and 449 (A) of the complete nucleotide sequence of pMV158 (de la Campa et al., 1990, Priebe and Lacks, 1989). Supercoiled DNA is the only productive substrate for replication of pMV158 in a cell-free extract (del Solar et al., 1987), and the nick site is located on the loop of one of the major plasmid secondary structures, Hairpin I (Puyet et al., 1988). This Hairpin I is located within a region (termed nic) physically distant of the RepB-binding site (del Solar et al., 1993a). In vitro, RepB protein binds to a set of three directly repeated sequences or iterons (the bind region) located 84 bp downstream of the nick site (de la Campa et al., 1990; del Solar et al., 1993a). In the present work we show that, in vitro, purified RepB protein relaxed supercoiled pMV158 DNA in a topoisomerase I-like reaction, having an optimal activity at 60°C. The protein was also able to nick and to covalently join two ss oligonucleotides containing the RepB-nicking sequence. These reactions reproduce initiation (nicking) and termination (closing) of RC replication. In addition, we have defined the bases involved in the cleavage mediated by RepB. On linear DNA, RepB absolutely required the nicking region to be in a single-stranded configuration. We have been unable to isolate any RepB-oligonucleotide covalent intermediates, and filter-binding assays showed that the RepB•DNA complexes were sensitive to treatment with SDS. We propose that a RepB•DNA association, different than a stable covalent linkage, is involved in the plasmid initiation of replication, similar to that of the gpII protein of coliphage fd (Meyer and Geider, 1979). This is the first example of a plasmid-encoded protein able to catalyze a site-specific nicking reaction without forming a stable protein-DNA covalent linkage. Supercoiled plasmid pMV158 DNA was isolated from cultures of Streptococcus pneumoniae by preparation of cleared lysates followed by two consecutive CsCl/ethidium bromide equilibrium gradients, as reported (del Solar et al., 1987). Oligonucleotides were purified essentially as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). In some cases, the oligonucleotides were not deprotected from tritylation after synthesis. In these cases, purification was performed by employing oligonucleotide purification cartridges (Applied Biosystems), following the instructions of the vendor. In other cases, oligonucleotides were further purified by HPLC. RepB protein was purified from Escherichia coli BL21DE3 (a gift of B. Studier) harboring plasmid pLS19 (del Solar et al., 1990), essentially as described (de la Campa et al., 1990) except that the DEAE-Sephacel step was omitted. The concentration of the protein preparation used here was 45 ng/μl, as calculated from its molar extinction coeffient and from determination of its amino acid composition. The protein was stable for more than 1 year at −70°C. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed with two concentrations of RepB (in 20 mM Tris•HCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 M KCl) at two temperatures, 10 and 25°C. Sedimentation values were corrected for the specific volume of the protein (157.31 ml/g), and for the molecular mass value of the RepB monomer (24,252 Da, as deduced from the DNA sequence). The final calculations gave a molecular mass of the RepB preparation of 6.056, that is a hexamer. Details of sedimentation data will be published elsewhere. Labeling of the oligodeoxyribonucleotides at their 3′-ends was done by using [α-32P]ddATP (5000 Ci/mmol) and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase; labeling at the 5′-ends was performed by using [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) and bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Corp.). Procedures for labeling followed published protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989). Under standard conditions, mixtures of RepB protein (45 ng) and pMV158 DNA (700 ng) were incubated in a total volume of 30 μl of buffer NB (20 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM MnCl2) for 30 min at the temperatures indicated in the text. In some cases, the nicking-closing reactions were performed in the presence of nicotinamide mononucleotide to control the possible presence of contaminant-adenylated DNA ligase in the RepB preparation (Lehman, 1974). After incubation, samples were treated with Proteinase K (125 μg/ml), incubated at 20°C for 10 min, and stopped by the addition of the loading buffer. The same results were obtained when Proteinase K was omitted, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.25 M EDTA. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) in 90 mM Tris borate, 2 mM EDTA buffer. The amount of specifically relaxed DNA was determined by laser densitometry of various negatives obtained from agarose gels. Since open circular (FII), relaxed covalently closed (FI′), and supercoiled (FI) plasmid forms give different specific fluorescence intensities, the yield of RepB nicking-closing products was calculated from the decrease of the fluorescence signal of the FI form relative to that of the untreated DNA. Treatment of supercoiled DNA with the KCl-containing incubation buffer resulted in some unspecific generation of FII forms. Unless otherwise stated, labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides (3.75 pmol) were incubated with RepB (at the concentrations indicated under “Results”) in 90 μl of NB for 30 min at 37, 45, or 60°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Proteinase K (320 μg/ml), and samples were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37°C. The reaction products were separated on 20% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 8 M urea. Radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography on Kodak X-Omat films, and the counts in the bands of the gels were directly quantified with the PhosphorImager ImageQuant equipment (Molecular Dynamics). Labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides (1.3 pmol) were mixed with unlabeled ones (2.5 pmol) and incubated with RepB (29 or 56 ng, 1.2 or 2.3 pmol, respectively) in 30 μl of NB for 30 min in the above conditions. Samples were treated, electrophoresed, and quantified as above. The 23-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide 5′-GGGGGGGCTACTACGACCCCCCC-3′containing the wild-type nic region of pMV158 was labeled at its 3′-end and incubated with RepB protein in the nicking conditions (see above) at 60°C. Reaction mixtures were loaded onto nitrocellulose filters (Millipore HA 0.45 μm) presoaked with NB buffer containing a 10-fold excess of a 23-mer cold unspecific oligonucleotide. Samples were filtered at a flow rate of about 1.5 ml/h, and filters were washed with 9 ml of NB buffer at the same flow rate. To analyze the stability of the RepB•DNA complexes, filters were washed with either NB to which the pH was adjusted to a range between 7.0 and 9.5 or NB-containing various amounts of KCl, NaCl, or SDS. Filters were dried, and the retained radioactivity (Cerenkov) was determined. Control samples did not receive RepB, and their value (about 80 cpm) was subtracted from each sample. Each experiment was performed at least twice. The minimal functional dso of pMV158 has been defined in vivo as located within a 247-bp region, which includes the three iterons and the RepB nick site (del Solar et al., 1993b; Fig. 1). Filter-binding assays with linear dsDNA showed that RepB protein specifically binds to a fragment that contains the bind region and did not bind to another DNA fragment containing the nic region (de la Campa et al., 1990). In addition, DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprintings on linear dsDNA with purified RepB protein (de la Campa et al., 1990), showed that the RepB-protected region encompasses the three iterons, the footprints not extending further toward Hairpin I (Fig. 1B). The frequency and distribution of nt around the plasmid nic region (Fig. 1C) shows a G+C-rich sequence surrounding the RepB nick site (448/449), flanked by A+T-rich sequences, a feature which is considered important in the generation of cruciform structures (Bowater et al., 1991). Hairpin I has been mapped on supercoiled pLS1 DNA by sensitivity to nuclease S1 (Puyet et al., 1988). It would thus seem that exposure of the unpaired nick site to RepB is an important stage in the initiation of pMV158 replication. We had observed that the incubation of supercoiled pLS1 DNA with purified RepB protein at 37°C resulted only in partial relaxation of the plasmid, even at high protein/DNA ratios or prolonged incubations (de la Campa et al., 1990). Plasmid pLS1 replicates in the mesophyle Bacillus subtilis, and a moderate increase in its copy number has been observed when the cells are grown at 45°C instead of at 37°C. 2M. Moscoso, G. del Solar, and M. Espinosa, unpublished observations. We incubated supercoiled pMV158 DNA with purified RepB protein at 37, 45, and 60°C (Fig. 2A). Treatment of supercoiled (form FI) DNA with RepB specifically yielded a mixture of nicked (FII) and covalently closed relaxed (FI′) plasmid molecules, which reflect, respectively, the nicking and nicking-closing ability of RepB. Generation of forms FII+FI′ was RepB-dependent, since only a slight amount of such forms was observed in samples not treated with the protein (Fig. 2A). To rule out the possibility that some contaminant adenylated DNA ligase was present in the RepB preparation (which could account for the closing reaction; Lehman, 1974; Kornberg and Baker, 1992), plasmid DNA was incubated with various amounts of nicotinamide mononucleotide in the presence or absence of RepB. The results (Fig. 2A) showed no significant influence of this compound on the nicking-closing reaction, which allows us to conclude that RepB is able to relax and to reseal supercoiled pMV158 DNA. At a fixed time, and at a constant concentration of RepB and its substrate, the amount of FII+FI′ DNA increased with the temperature, varying between 60% (at 37°C) and 95% (at 60°C). At 32°C or below, less than 25% of the input DNA was affected by incubation with RepB (not shown). A time-course experiment showed that the RepB-mediated nicking (and nicking-closing) was very fast at 60°C, since about 80% of the substrate DNA was converted to FII+FI′ molecules after 1 min of incubation (Fig. 2B). The reaction slowed down at 45°C, and no plateau was reached at 37°C. Concentration dependence assays (Fig. 2C) indicated that a majority of the pMV158 DNA was relaxed by RepB in a period of 30 min in the presence of 34 ng of the protein (or below, depending upon the temperature). Similar results were obtained when supercoiled pLS1 plasmid DNA was used as substrate (not shown). In the above experiments, the ratio of RepB molecules to DNA molecules was 9.5:1, assuming that all protein molecules in our RepB preparation were active, and that the active species of the protein is a monomer. However, analyses of the RepB-configuration by analytical ultracentrifugation showed that RepB is an hexamer (not shown). The activity of RepB depended on the presence of Mn2+, this cation being partially replaceable by Mg2+ (de la Campa et al., 1990). Incubation with the topoisomerase I-inhibitor camptothecin (Avemann et al., 1988), or with the pMV158-encoded CopG protein (del Solar et al., 1990), did not affect the RepB-mediated reactions (not shown). Relaxation of supercoiled DNA by RepB did not seem to require high energy cofactors, since incubation with ATP did not influence the reactions. No consensus ATP-binding domain has been found in RepB. We next assayed the in vitro activity of RepB protein on single-stranded oligonucleotides. To this end, a 23-mer oligonucleotide containing the RepB wild-type nick site (see Fig. 4, oligo wt) was synthesized, labeled at its 5′-end, and treated with increasing amounts of RepB at the three above mentioned temperatures. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 20% sequencing gel. If RepB were able to nick this substrate, a labeled 15-mer product should be observed. The results (Fig. 3A) showed that a band of this size was generated in all of the RepB-treated samples, its intensity being increased as the ratio of RepB/DNA was augmented. Several labeled bands were visible in the untreated samples, some of them sensitive to RepB-nicking. Purification of the labeled 23-mer oligonucleotide by HPLC did not improve this pattern; extraction of the upper 23-mer band from native polyacrylamide gels resulted in the failure of RepB to act on this substrate. We assume that these bands are due to the G7 residues located at the 5′-end of the 23-mer, which could either generate intrastrand pairings with the C7 nt or complicate the oligonucleotide synthesis. To avoid these inconvenients, a second 23-mer oligonucleotide containing the RepB-nick sequence, but lacking any possible intrastrand pairing (Fig. 4, oligoC), was synthesized and treated with RepB. In this case, a clear band of 15-mer, resulting from RepB-cleavage of the input ssDNA was observed (Fig. 3B). Quantification of the reaction products showed that the RepB-concentration dependence curves resembled those observed for supercoiled DNA (Fig. 3C). The single-stranded 23-mers appeared to be slightly more sensitive to RepB than the supercoiled DNA, since 90% digestion of the substrate (60°C, 30 min) was achieved at the protein/DNA ratio (in molecules) of 3:1 for ssDNA and of 9.5:1 for supercoiled DNA. The results demonstrate that RepB is able to digest single-stranded DNA substrates, having or not having a possible intrastrand pairing, but sharing the sequence: 5′-TACTACGAC6-3′.Figure 3:Nicking activity of RepB on ssDNA. A, the 23-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide containing the wild type nic region of plasmid pMV158 (oligowt: 5′-GGGGGGGCTACTACGACCCCCCC-3′) was labeled at its 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase. 2.5 pmol of the labeled oligo was treated with 9.3 pmol of RepB (ratio protein/DNA of 3.7:1, molecules) at the indicated temperatures. The upper band (arrow) is the 23-mer oligonucleotide, the band below it (arrow) and the other bands are, most likely, products from defective oligonucleotide synthesis or of intrastrand pairing. They are also cleaved by RepB. The lowerband is the 15-mer cleavage product, which co-migrates with a labeled band. B, the 23-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-TGCTTCCGTACTACGACCCCCCA-3′ (oligoC, Fig. 4), which lacked any possible intrastrand pairing, was 5′-end labeled and treated with RepB, as in panelA, except that the amount of RepB was increased to show maximum nicking. Note that no bands migrating between the 23- and the 15-mer products are visible in this case. M, ladder marker. C, The labeled oligo wt 23-mer (3.7 pmol) was incubated during 30 min, at 37 (▴), 45 (▵), and 60°C (•) with various concentrations of RepB (3.7, 7.5, 11.2, 15, 18.5, and 28 pmol). The protein/DNA ratios (in molecules) were of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, and 7.5:1, respectively. As controls, RepB-untreated samples were run. The band co-migrating with the 15-mer RepB-product was considered as control and subtracted from the RepB-treated samples after direct quantification of the RepB products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The sequence specificity of RepB on the nick site was tested by assaying its nicking activity on single-stranded 23-mer oligonucleotides in which base changes at the RepB-nick region were introduced. The reaction products were quantified and compared with the RepB nicking activity on the 23-mer containing the wild-type nick site. As can be observed (Fig. 4), at 5′ of the nick site (G15/A16) only a G15→A change was allowed, although it reduced by 50% the amount of digested DNA. At 3′ of the nick, the A16 could be changed by C or T without much reduction in the RepB activity. However, one G at this position made the oligonucleotide insensitive to RepB. In addition, a C to G change in the second nt after the nick site (C17→G) resulted in a substrate not recognized by RepB. This finding was unexpected because we had ascribed the C7 tract at 3′ of the nick site as being mainly involved in the generation of Hairpin I on supercoiled DNA, by intrastrand pairing with the G7 tract 5′ of the nick. Generation of this structure on supercoiled DNA would indeed expose the phosphodiester bond in the GpA nick site as a single-stranded region. The failure of RepB to nick the 23-mer containing the C17→G change, could indicate either a requirement for the generation of a secondary structure in the ssDNA substrate or that the nt at this particular position is important. The latter explanation is more likely, since (i) the oligo B (having the C17→G change) could generate a secondary structure but was still insensitive to RepB and (ii) the oligo C is fully sensitive to RepB and yet it shuld not generate any intrastrand pairing. In addition, changing the C-stretch downstream of this C17 nt by A and T residues did not affect cleavage by RepB (not shown). The protein did not recognize the sequence complementary to its nicking region (oligo comp), which demonstrates that nicking by RepB is sequence-specific. This oligonucleotide also contains the G7 and C7 ends, so that intrastrand pairings and secondary structures within the RepB substrate are not important features when the substrate is in a single-stranded configuration. We conclude that C17 also plays an important role within the DNA sequence for RepB nicking. The critical role of sequences downstream of the nick site for RepB-cleavage contrasts with the requirements observed for TraI protein of plasmid RP4, which requires 6 nt upstream of the nick site but has no base specificity downstream of it (Pansegrau et al., 1993). Finally, a ds oligonucleotide containing the wild type nicking region, obtained by hybridization of the oligonucleotides wt and comp, was not a substrate of purified RepB protein (not shown). Since RepB relaxed supercoiled DNA (Fig. 2) but did not cleave linear dsDNA, it would appear that the nic region has to be exposed in a single-stranded configuration within the supercoiled DNA plasmid molecules. In fact, RepB was unable to nick linear ds pLS1 DNA as judged from alkaline agarose gels. 3M. Moscoso, unpublished observations. RepB protein specifically cleaved ssDNA harboring some changes in the nic region (Fig. 4), suggesting that the protein could recognize as substrate other dso of pMV158-related plasmids. We have preliminary evidence suggesting that this is, indeed, the case. We can then draw the following conclusions: (i) the DNA sequence cleaved by RepB has to be in a single-stranded conformation; (ii) generation of a secondary structure within the 23-mer is not required; and (iii) the protein recognizes the 9-nt consensus sequence (5′-TACTACR/HC (IUB code, R = puryne; H = not G). A computer search revealed that no other nt sequence of this kind is present in pMV158. The above results show that RepB has the ability of nicking ssDNA in a site-specific reaction. Consequently, the protein should be able to initiate rolling circle replication. Termination by this replication mechanism has to be achieved by (i) the introduction of a new nick, (ii) closing of the nick on the newly synthesized strand, and (iii) the covalent joining of the ends of the displaced strand in a reaction probably catalyzed by RepB. The protein is able to nick and then to close supercoiled DNA as judged from the specific generation of forms FI′ (Fig. 2), but details of the closing reaction are more difficult to analyze with this substrate. To know how the RepB protein would seal the nick it generated, two oligonucleotides of different sizes (23- and 26-mer), and both having the nick site located at different distances from their ends, were synthesized (Fig. 5). Either one or the other of the two oligonucleotides was 5′-labeled, mixed with twice the amount of the other unlabeled oligonucleotide, and treated with RepB protein. If a RepB-mediated cleavage-joining reaction occurred, a new band corresponding to a labeled 29-mer DNA product should appear when using the labeled 23-mer. Conversely, the reaction product that should be detected when the labeled ssDNA was the 26-mer is a new band corresponding to a 20-mer oligonucleotide. As can be seen (Fig. 5), bands corresponding to the products of nicking and nicking-closing reactions were observed in the RepB-treated samples, similar to the results found for TraI protein of plasmid RP4 (Pansegrau et al., 1993). The closing reaction mediated by RepB was further analyzed by attempts to join oligonucleotides that contained, respectively, the right and the left half of the nick region (Fig. 6). First, a 5′-labeled 15-mer ending at the nick site (pG-OH) was mixed with a phosphorylated 8-mer initiating at the nick site (pAp). If RepB were able to covalently join both halves of its nick region without previous nicking, a 23-mer reaction product should be detected. The results (Fig. 6A) showed that this was not the case, indicating that the substrate has to be cleaved by the protein prior to the closing reaction. To test this, the same labeled 15-mer (ending in pG-OH) was mixed with a labeled 26-mer oligonucleotide, which contains all of the wild-type nicking region, and treated with RepB (Fig. 6B). In this case, the protein cleaved the 26-mer to generate a labeled 12-mer product. In addition, a new band corresponding to a labeled 29-mer oligonucleotide was also identified. The new 29-mer product should arise from the RepB-mediated covalent join of the nicked 3′-half (14-mer) with the 3′-OH end of the 15-mer. This closing reaction was not observed if the 15-mer to be joined has an end different than the wild-type, even if the pG-OH was kept unchanged (not shown). A complementary experiment was performed; the above 26-mer was mixed with a labeled 8-mer containing the region 3′ to the nick and was incubated with RepB. The 20-mer closing product was not detected (Fig. 6C). Taking these two results together, we conclude that the protein can only close the nick if a RepB-generated 5′-phosphate end is provided. The 3′-OH end to be closed has to belong to the nick sequence, but it does not need to be generated by the protein. These results indicate that the RepB-mediated nicking reaction would leave an “activated” 5′-phosphate end 3′ to the nick. Since RepB failed at nicking oligonucleotides extracted from polyacrylamide gels, verification of this putative activation by reisolation of the 14-mer RepB-generated intermediate (Fig. 6B) was not feasible. In addition, we have observed that gel retardation assays performed with RepB and the 26-mer oligonucleotide did not generate any retarded band (not shown), perhaps indicating that protein-DNA complexes were dissociated during electrophoresis. Whether “activation” is the consequence of a reaction that requires the simultaneous presence of the protein and the two substrates to be joined (the 26- and the 15-mer, Fig. 6B) and whether this reaction could be somehow uncoupled is under investigation. Several nicking-closing enzymes (Rep protein of the RC-plasmid pT181, gene A product from ϕX174, and Tra and Mob proteins from plasmids RP4 and RSF1010) are able to nick and close DNA through a stable covalent protein-DNA intermediate (Rasooly and Novick, 1993; Langeveld et al., 1978; Pansegrau et al., 1990; Scherzinger et al., 1992). To know if a covalent RepB-DNA intermediate is generated, the 23-mer oligo wt (Fig. 4) was labeled at its 3′-end and treated with RepB protein. The reaction products were digested with Proteinase K in order to leave a short peptide linked to the DNA if a covalent protein-DNA complex were generated. As can be seen (Fig. 6D), only free DNA species of 8-mer in size (in addition to the 23-mer) were detected. These are the expected products if no covalent DNA-peptide heteromolecules are the reaction products. Several other experiments aimed at detecting any possible RepB-DNA covalently linked intermediates, using either supercoiled DNA or single-stranded oligonucleotides as substrates, gave negative results (not shown). To analyze the nature of the RepB•DNA complexes, we made use of a filter-binding assay (de la Campa et al., 1990). To this end, the 23-mer oligo wt was 3′-end labeled and incubated with RepB at 60°C, in conditions of maximum nicking (Fig. 3). The reaction products were filtered, and the filters were washed with various buffers (Table 1). The results showed that RepB•DNA complexes were extremely sensitive to SDS, again supporting the noncovalent nature of the RepB-binding to DNA. Complexes were moderately sensitive to high salts, indicating that electrostatic interactions take place between the protein and its target DNA. The predicted isoelectric point of RepB is 8.8, so we should expect a reduction in the protein•DNA complexes once this point is surpassed. Washing buffers with pH above this point also reduced the amount of DNA retained in the filters (Table 1), suggesting that the interactions between RepB and DNA could take place through positively charged amino acids. Based on all of the above data, we tentatively conclude that RepB•DNA interaction can be exerted either through the generation of a transient phosphodiester bond, as is the case with the gene II product of coliphage fd (Meyer and Geider, 1979), or through a noncovalent binding.Table I Open table in a new tab The initiator of replication RepB protein from plasmid pMV158 has nicking-closing, sequence-specific activities, as expected for a protein involved in RC-replication. We have simulated a process in which purified RepB protein performed the reactions involved in initiation and termination of plasmid RC-replication. RepB has specific nicking activity on ssDNA containing the nic region, which is the one present in the plasmid (+) strand. RC-replication shares features with conjugative processes since ssDNA intermediates are generated, and proteins involved in conjugative transfer also nick their substrate DNA (Pansegrau et al., 1990, 1993). However, in contrast to other Rep, Tra, and Mob plasmid-encoded proteins, which generate a protein•DNA covalent bond (Thomas et al., 1990; Pansegrau et al., 1990; Scherzinger et al., 1992; Rasooly and Novick, 1993), RepB protein of pMV158 did not show any detectable covalent link with DNA. RepB absolutely required single-stranded or supercoiled DNA substrate to nick its target since it failed to cleave a ds oligonucleotide containing the nicking site and it was unable to nick linear ds pLS1 DNA.3 In addition, replication of pMV158 in a cell-free extract absolutely required supercoiled DNA (del Solar et al., 1987). The RepB-requirement for supercoiled substrate and its activity on ssDNA strongly indicate that generation of Hairpin I and exposure of the nick site in a single-stranded configuration is essential for initiation of replication of pMV158 (del Solar et al., 1987, 1993b, this work). The above features of RepB resemble those found for proteins A and gpII from coliphages ϕX174 and fd respectively, since both proteins also need the substrate to be supercoiled or single-stranded (Langeveld et al., 1978; Meyer and Geider, 1979; van Mansfeld et al., 1980). Although negatively supercoiled DNA seems to be the preferred substrate for nicking-closing proteins, the MobABC complex of plasmid RSF1010 nicks linear dsDNA with identical requirements as those for supercoiled DNA, except that more MobC is needed (Scherzinger et al., 1992). Furthermore, RepC of plasmid pT181 acts on supercoiled DNA (Noirot et al., 1990), but it is able to conduct in vitro replication with a relaxed DNA substrate (Khan et al., 1982) and shows specific nicking activity on lineal dsDNA in vitro (Koepsel and Khan, 1987). The reaction conditions of RepB also differ from other nicking-closing enzymes. RepB is an hexamer; it shows an optimal temperature at 60°C, and it requires Mn2+, whereas the other proteins in general have a dimeric configuration, they require Mg2+ and show optimal temperature for cleavage at 37°C or below. Many of the Tra and Mob proteins exhibit common motifs that are also conserved in the Rep proteins of RC plasmids and ssDNA coliphages (Pansegrau and Lanka, 1991; Ilyina and Koonin, 1992; Waters and Guiney, 1993). Furthermore, the dso of many RC-plasmids, the (+) origins of ssDNA coliphages, and the oriT of conjugative plasmids have sequence homologies at their nic region (Waters and Guiney, 1993). Although the protein motifs are conserved in the pMV158 plasmid family, the nic region in the DNA of these plasmids has no resemblance with known cognate regions in other plasmids or coliphages (del Solar et al., 1993a). Three possible Tyr residues (at positions 14, 99, and 115) could be the candidates for realizing the nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bond at the RepB nick site by a tyrosil-OH group. The residue most likely involved in this reaction is Tyr99, since it is conserved among all nicking-closing proteins from plasmids and viruses (Ilyina and Koonin, 1992). One feature of the plasmids of the pMV158 family is that they all contain two or three iterons of different lengths, which are separated from the nick site by a spacer sequence ranging between 13 and 91 bp (del Solar et al., 1993a). In the case of pMV158, purified RepB protein binds to the iterons and introduces the nick 84 bp upstream of its binding site (de la Campa et al., 1990). Nevertheless, with the substrates employed here, RepB was able not only to nick and close pMV158 supercoiled DNA but also linear ssDNA, which lacked the iterons. This behavior differs from gpII protein of the filamentous phage f1, which requires the presence of its binding region (in a ds configuration) to introduce the nick within a single stranded oligonucleotide (Higashitani et al., 1994). Although the protein did not generate a stable covalent linkage to DNA, the 5′-end (but not the 3′-end) generated in the nicking reaction was activated by RepB. The ability of RepB to join the 5′-phosphate end of the nicking reaction product with a new 3′-end (Fig. 6B), in conjuction with the failure of the protein to catalize the joining of the 3′-OH generated during nicking with a provided 5′-phosphate end (Fig. 6C), indicated that the 5′-end to be closed is activated somehow by the RepB nicking. This RepB-mediated activation of the 5′-end suggests that the protein•DNA interactions occurring at the initiation of replication are important for the termination process, if this activation is maintained during replication. We envisage termination of pMV158 RC replication as the result of the following reactions: (i) introduction of a second nick at the GpA dinucleotide, the A residue belonging to the newly synthesized DNA and becoming activated (perhaps by a new RepB molecule); (ii) a closing reaction between the pG-OH end of the newly synthesized DNA and the A residue activated in this second nicking reaction, with the concomitant release of a dsDNA molecule, and (iii) a second closing reaction between the 5′-pA end, activated at the initiation stage, and the pG-OH end generated in the second nicking reaction, which leads to the release of a circular ssDNA molecule. Activation could indicate that either the protein or the nicked DNA suffered a conformational change to keep the energy to close the nick. In our opinion, the first possibility seems more likely. However, as in the case of gpII protein from filamentous coliphages, how the energy of the RepB-cleavage is stored for the ligation reaction is unknown (Kornberg and Baker, 1992). Consequently, the nicking-closing reaction mediated by RepB more closely resembles that exerted by the gpII protein of coliphage fd (Meyer and Geider, 1979) than those by Rep proteins of the RC-plasmids of the pT181 family (Thomas et al., 1990, Wang et al., 1992, Dempsey et al., 1992; Rasooly et al., 1994). Whether RepB acts through a noncovalent nucleophylic attack toward its target or through a transient covalent bond, is not yet known. To explain how RepB acts at a distance, a complex DNA structure for this region was proposed (de la Campa et al., 1990). A DNA intrinsic curvature appears to exist within the plasmid origin, as reflected by (i) the presence of (dT-dA)n tracts spaced by integer helix turns (Fig. 1 B), (ii) the anomalous migration of dso-containing DNA fragments in polyacrylamide gels (not shown), and (iii) the distribution of bands of hipersensitivity to DNase I, as well as the hydroxyl radical footprinting pattern of naked DNA (de la Campa et al., 1990). Cylindrical projection of the DNA helix between coordinates 400 and 600 (not shown) indicates that the RepB nick site and the center of the iterons are located in the same face of the helix. We propose that the DNA sequence between the iterons and the nic region could provide a flexible arm (flexibility, which could be increased by Mn2+ ions), so that the binding of RepB to the iterons could appropriately place the protein close to Hairpin I. Such a highly sophisticated protein•DNA interplay should lead to local unwinding of the DNA and to the exposure of the nick site in a single-stranded form. Whether this spacer acts as an enhacer for replication, as is the case of filamentous phages (Horiuchi, 1986), is not known. Be that as it may, the actual mechanism of termination of replication by RepB is intriguing. The elegant model proposed by Rasooly and Novick(1993) for termination of pT181 replication is based on the inactivation of RepC protein through generation of a RepC heterodimer. However, in the case of RepB of pMV158, the lack of stable covalent binding of RepB to DNA would indicate that this mechanism of inactivation does not occur in pMV158. Yet, the plasmid copy number is subjected to a strict control which, in addition to the role of the plasmid-encoded repressors (del Solar and Espinosa, 1992; Fig. 1), should involve lack of recycling of the initiator protein.

Presumably the variability and severity of the mutations responsible for inactivation of β-mannosidase account for some of the phenotypic variation in the human cases. It is not known if the differences in disease expression between ruminants and humans is primarily related to the types of mutations, species differences in development, the nature of the storage products, or effects on thyroid function.In order to understand the molecular lesions underlying β-mannosidosis and the basis of the variation in disease expression between species, cloning and characterization of normal β-mannosidase was initiated. Lysosomal β-mannosidase is expressed at very low levels in most tissues and purification of this enzyme proved difficult (25Kyosaka S. Murata S. Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Chem. Pharm. Bull.

The production of anti-β-mannosidase monoclonal antibody permitted the establishment of a four-step chromatography procedure resulting in high purification levels of bovine β-mannosidase in our laboratory(28Sopher B.L.

Using this peptide sequence information we successfully isolated bovine β-mannosidase cDNA clones covering the entire coding region, the 3′-noncoding region, and some of the 5′-noncoding region. This is the first report of cloning of lysosomal β-mannosidase cDNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPartial Amino Acid Sequencingβ-Mannosidase protein was purified from 2.4-kg bovine kidney (Ada Beef Co., Ada, MI) using anti-β-mannosidase monoclonal antibody as described(28Sopher B.L.

The purity of the protein preparation after the Mono S step was verified by Coomassie Blue staining and Western analysis. The purified protein was dialyzed against 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution, lyophilized, and submitted to the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University for amino acid sequencing. Approximately 740 pmol of purified protein (from a total of 1240 pmol) was subjected to CNBr/trypsin digestion. Peptides were separated by C18 reverse phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)RACErapid amplification of cDNA endsPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and repurified by C8 reverse phase HPLC if needed. Sequence information was obtained from 12 peptides.Construction of Synthetic Oligonucleotide ProbesMixed and unique oligonucleotides were synthesized on Applied Biosystems model 394 and 380 B DNA synthesizers in the Macromolecular Structural Facility at Michigan State University. Regions with minimal codon redundancy were chosen to construct mixed oligonucleotide probes. Guessmers were constructed according to the typical codon usage frequency of human protein(30Lathe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Gene-specific oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were designed based on the Primer Program (Scientific & Educational Software). Oligonucleotides used in the screening and PCR analysis are listed in Table 1.Table I Open table in a new tab Labeling ProbesOligonucleotide probes were prepared by 5′ end labeling. Each 20-μl reaction contained 10 pmol of oligonucleotide, 15 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, DuPont NEN), 1 μl of 20 × buffer (Boehringer Mannheim), and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using an Nuctrap push column (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA fragments were labeled by the random primed method (Boehringer Mannheim) using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham).cDNA Library ScreeningNormal bovine thyroid tissue was supplied to Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) for construction of a λZAP II cDNA library. The bovine thyroid cDNA library, primed by both oligo(dT) and random primers and consisting of 1.2 × 106 independent clones with an average insert size of 2.0 kb, was plated at a density of 1 × 104 plaque forming units/150-mm Petri dish. In situ amplification of plaques was performed as described (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience (John Wiley & Sons), New York1987Google Scholar). The filters were prehybridized for 2 h and hybridized for 2-3 days at 46-48°C in a solution containing 3 M trimethylammonium chloride (Aldrich or Sigma), 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 × Denhardt's solution (1% Ficoll, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1% bovine serum albumin), 0.6% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA (Boehringer Mannheim). Approximately 1-2 × 106 cpm/ml of 5′ end-labeled mixed oligonucleotide probes with specific activity of 2-10 × 106 cpm/pmol were used during the hybridization. Filters were washed by standard procedures (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience (John Wiley & Sons), New York1987Google Scholar) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80°C for 1-3 days with intensifying screens. To maximize the screening, four 17-mer mixed oligonucleotides were used sequentially for probing the filters. Previous probes were removed by incubating hybridized filters in 0.4 M NaOH for 30 min at 45°C and then 0.1 × SSC solution containing 0.1% SDS and 0.2 M Tris•Cl, pH 7.5, for 30 min at 45°C. Putative positive plaques were purified through several rounds of rescreening at lower densities and then excised as pBluescript plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions. To isolate a full-length cDNA, the 1.6-kb insert of clone 47MJ4 was isolated and labeled to a specific activity of 1.4 × 109 cpm/μg. Up to 1 × 106 cpm/ml of the denatured probe was added in a 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M NaH2PO4•H2O, 1.0 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) hybridization solution containing 50% formamide (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.5% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 10 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA to reprobe original filters at 42°C. After approximately 20 h incubation, the filters were washed in 2 × SSC, (1 × SSC, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M Na citrate, pH 7.0) 0.1% SDS, 2 × 10 min at room temperature, then washed until a low background signal was achieved. The final wash was 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS solution at 65°C for 30 min.cDNA Synthesis and Polymerase Chain ReactionTotal RNA (10 μg) or poly(A)+ mRNA (1 μg) was heated at 65°C for 5 min, then incubated with 10 μl of 5 × reverse transcription buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 μl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 5 μl of 10 mM dNTP mixture, 1.5 μl of 40 units/μl RNasin (Promega), 5-75 pmol of antisense oligonucleotide, and 200-400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 50 μl of reaction mixture at 37°C for 1 h. Synthesized first strand cDNAs were precipitated by adding an equal volume of 4 M ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol and resuspended in 50 μl of distilled water. An aliquot (1-2 μl) of the cDNAs was amplified in 50 μl reaction volume by AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus) in the GeneAmp PCR system 9600 (Perkin-Elmer). Generally, 30-35 PCR cycles were performed and each PCR cycle consisted of 45 s denaturation at 94°C, 1-min annealing at 46-55°C, and 1-min extension at 72°C. A 5-min predenaturation at 95°C and an additional 10-min extension at 72°C were applied before and after the cycle reactions, respectively. One-fourth of the amplified product was analyzed by electrophoresis on Nusieve 3:1 agarose gels (FMC BioProducts). To perform reamplification and nested PCR, agarose containing the band of interest was removed using a capillary tube. The agarose was either used directly (5 μl) in reamplification reactions or diluted in distilled water, and aliquots of agarose suspension were used in PCR reactions.To analyze putative clones, PCR was performed using either plasmid DNA or crude phage lysates as templates. The crude phage lysates were prepared by adding an equal volume of 0.1 M NaOH to an aliquot of phage stock, incubating for 10 min at 95°C, and then neutralizing by adding 1/20 volume of 2 M Tris•Cl, pH 7.5.To clone the 5′-region of β-mannosidase cDNA, the 5′-RACE system kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from bovine thyroid was copied into single strand cDNAs using a gene-specific primer MJ100 designed from the antisense strand of the 5′ end of clone 17MJ48 (Table 1). The cDNA was tailed with homo-poly(dC) and then amplified by an anchor primer (AP) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a nested gene-specific primer, MJ101. The 950-bp product was gel purified and reamplified by a universal amplification primer and the primer MJ101 and by universal amplification primer and a nested degenerate primer MJ48. The specific PCR products were gel purified and directly sequenced by a nested antisense primer MJ110 and cloned into the pCRtm II vector using a TA Cloning system (Invitrogen). Clones containing the correct insert size were subjected to sequencing.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot HybridizationTotal RNA was extracted from various bovine and caprine tissues and from both normal and affected animals according to standard procedures(31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience (John Wiley & Sons), New York1987Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using a poly(A)+ quick mRNA kit (Stratagene). Poly(A)+ RNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde as described (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience (John Wiley & Sons), New York1987Google Scholar) and blotted on Hybond-N membrane (Amersham). Northern hybridization was performed by standard procedures (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using radiolabeled 47MJ4 insert, or the EcoRI fragment of 17MJ48 and a PCR product from 46MJ4 as probe(s). Filters were washed in a stepwise fashion according to the background signal with a final wash in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42°C. The filters were exposed at −80°C for 10 days. After removal of the β-mannosidase probe, the blot was rehybridized to a cDNA probe of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to normalize the amounts of RNA.DNA Sequencing and Computer AnalysisDouble strand DNA was prepared using a Magic (Wizard) miniprep DNA purification system (Promega). Sequencing was carried out by the Taq cycling method using either dye terminators or dye primers (M13 −21 primer and M13 reverse primer) on a 373A DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) in the DNA Sequencing Facility at Michigan State University. The entire inserts in clones 46MJ4, 47MJ4, 17MJ48, and C2U48 were sequenced from both strands using internal oligonucleotide primers. PCR products were either directly sequenced after purification or were cloned into pCRtm II vector using the TA cloning kit. Plasmid DNAs were then prepared and sequenced as described above. DNA sequencing analysis and homology search against GenBank were performed using GCG program version 7, April, 1991 (Genetics Computer Group DNA Sequence Analysis Software).Southern Hybridization AnalysisFor chromosomal localization studies, a DNA panel of 24 human/rodent somatic cell hybrids was obtained from NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository, Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ). Approximately 15 μg of DNA of each hybrid was digested with PstI and separated on a 1% agarose gel. A PCR product of clone 46MJ4 was labeled by random priming to a specific activity of 4 × 108 cpm/μg and used as a probe in the Southern blot analysis. Hybridization was carried out in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA for 20 h at 42°C. The final wash was in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 42°C. The blot was exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −80°C for 3-10 days with intensifying screens.RESULTSPeptide SequencingBovine β-mannosidase was purified approximately 150,000-fold by a four-step chromatography procedure. The final protein preparation revealed two predominant peptides of about 100 and 110 kDa, with 100 kDa being the major peptide as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1). Both peptides represent β-mannosidase as shown in previous studies(28Sopher B.L. Traviss C.E. Cavanagh K.T. Jones M.Z. Friderici K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sopher B.L. Traviss C.E. Cavanagh K.T. Jones M.Z. Friderici K.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and as demonstrated by reaction with anti-β-mannosidase polyclonal serum (data not shown). Previous studies in our laboratory suggested that the N terminus of β-mannosidase protein was blocked. In addition, trypsin-cleaved peptides appeared to be relatively insoluble. Therefore, the purified protein was subjected to combined CNBr and trypsin digestions. Fractionation of the CNBr/tryptic digest yielded multiple peptides suitable for direct sequencing or sequencing after rechromatography (Fig. 2). Sequencing of 14 peptides including those repurified by reverse-phase HPLC resulted in a total of nine non-overlapping peptides with complete sequences (Table 2) plus additional peptides with incomplete or mixed sequences. Four peptide sequences (142r12, 151r72, 218r24, and 103) were found to match previous peptide sequences (1∗, 2∗, and 3∗ in Table 2) resulting from sequencing of CNBr peptides of a deglycosylated gel purified 86-kDa protein (corresponding to the 100-kDa glycosylated β-mannosidase protein). Searches with all peptide sequences obtained revealed no significant homologies with existing proteins in the GenBank, SwissProt, or EMBL data bases.Figure 2:Reverse phase HPLC profile of CNBr/tryptic-cleaved peptides of β-mannosidase. Approximately 750 pmol of β-mannosidase protein purified by a four-step column purification procedure were subjected to CNBr and trypsin digestions and separated by C18 reverse phase HPLC. Peptides 103, 171, 180, and 253 were sequenced directly. Mixed sequences were obtained from peptide 253. Peptides 104, 142, 151, 169, 218, 251, 265, and 267 were subjected to repurification by C8 reverse phase HPLC before sequencing. Peptides 251, 265, and 267 did not yield sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table II Open table in a new tab Isolation and Characterization of cDNA ClonesPrevious attempts at cloning β-mannosidase cDNA included immunoscreening using anti-β-mannosidase polyclonal antibodies(28Sopher B.L.

Friderici K.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), plaque hybridization using several mixed oligonucleotides or guessmers derived from peptide sequences, and PCR with various combinations of degenerate oligonucleotide primers. All these attempts were performed without success, presumably because of the very low level of expression of this lysosomal enzyme. The following strategy was thus adopted. First, to enrich for β-mannosidase transcripts, bovine thyroid gland, the tissue showing the highest expression of β-mannosidase activity, was used to construct a cDNA library. Second, oligonucleotides that, in previous studies, hybridized well with closely matching nucleotide sequences or that were derived from peptide sequences produced by two different sequencing sources (e.g. 142r12) were used for screening. Third, in an effort to increase detection levels, in situ amplification of plaques was performed(31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience (John Wiley & Sons), New York1987Google Scholar). Finally, multiple oligonucleotides and sequential hybridization were used.By screening approximately 5 × 105 phage from the bovine thyroid cDNA library sequentially with four different degenerate oligonucleotides, MJ4, MJ48, MJ63, and MJ64, a total of 19 positive clones were detected. Of the 19 positive clones, three clones identified with MJ4 (43MJ4, 46MJ4, and 47MJ4) also hybridized with guessmers MJ7, MJ23, and MJ65. These oligonucleotides correspond to three different nonoverlapping peptides, suggesting clones 43MJ4, 46MJ4, and 47MJ4 are likely to be genuine positive clones. These three clones were plaque purified, excised as pBluescript plasmids, and subjected to further analyses. Restriction enzyme digestion showed that clones 43MJ4 and 47MJ4 each contained a ~1.6-kb insert with identical restriction maps, indicating that they were the same clone, while clone 46MJ4 contained an insert of ~1.8 kb with a restriction map similar to the other two clones (Fig. 3). Sequence analysis revealed that clones 43MJ4 and 47MJ4 (referred to as 47MJ4 in all later sections), and 46MJ4 all started at the same 5′-nucleotide which corresponded to a cleaved internal EcoRI site and contained an open reading frame of 730 bp. There were two single nucleotide differences between clones 46MJ4 and 47MJ4: C at position 2418 was replaced by G in clone 47MJ4 with no impact on the amino acid sequence, while C at position 2125 was substituted by T in clone 47MJ4 (Fig. 4), resulting in an amino acid change (H709D). The aspartic acid (D) was found in that position in the direct peptide sequence of peptide 151r72. The sequence homology between clones 46MJ4 and 47MJ4 diverged at 1182 bp from their 5′ ends. The authenticity of both clones was established by colinearity of the predicted amino acid sequence of the two clones with five microsequenced peptide sequences (103, 218r24, 151r72, 180, and 171) (Fig. 4).Figure 3:Restriction map and sequencing strategy for β-mannosidase cDNA clones.

https://openalex.org/W2072617141,"Previous studies have indicated that cell-specific expression of the human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) gene may be mediated by a placental-specific enhancer (CSEn). In the current studies, we have analyzed the promoter elements that are required for enhancer and promoter function in choriocarcinoma cells (BeWo). Mutation of both hCS GHF1 sites had no effect on promoter or enhancer activity. In contrast, mutation of the Sp1 site diminished basal and CSEn-stimulated transcription by ≈75% and ≈56%, respectively, indicating that Sp1 was necessary but not sufficient for maximal basal and enhancer-mediated transcription. Deletion and site-specific mutation of the proximal promoter region indicated that the TATA box and an initiator site (InrE) located between nucleotides −15/+1 of the hCS promoter were required for maximal promoter and enhancer function. Mutations of the InrE were associated with reduced basal and enhancer-stimulated activities and altered transcription initiation sites. A protein of 70-kDa mass, that was preferentially expressed in human choriocarcinoma cells (BeWo and JEG-3), bound specifically to the InrE. The data suggest that an initiator present in high concentrations in placental cells contributes to the control of cell-specific hCS gene expression at the promoter level and is required for maximal enhancer function.

Oxidative treatment reduced the resulting current IaK, while no inhibition was observed for IaK protein mutants carrying a Ser mutation instead of a highly conserved Cys residue in the intracellular domain. In contrast, Hg2+, which may not only oxidize thiol groups but also form chelates with dibasic amino acids, caused a use-dependent, positive regulation of IaK. This effect was reversed in an IaK protein mutant with a deletion in the extracellular domain. These data suggest opposite effects of peroxides and Hg2+ on IaK, a peroxide-mediated IaK inhibition by intracellular oxidation and a Hg2+-mediated IaK increase, caused by extracellular Hg2+ chelation of the IaK protein.

Circ.

The quaternary structure of IaK channels as well as the mechanism of IaK activation are unknown. In contrast, much is known about regulation of IaK by a number of second messengers and kinases, such as [Ca2+]i and kinases A and C (for review, see (3Busch A.E. Maylie J. Cell. Physiol.

Since localized inhibition of IKa by peroxides may be involved in the genesis of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias(6Cerbai E. Ambrosio G. Porciatti F. Chiariello M. Giotti A. Mugelli A.

The two-microelectrode voltage clamp configuration was used to record currents from Xenopus laevis oocytes 2-10 days after cRNA injection. Recordings were performed at 22°C using a Geneclamp amplifier, pClamp software for data acquisition and analysis (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and a Kipp & Zonen chart recorder. If not otherwise stated, IaK was evoked with 15-s voltage steps to −10 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV every 45 s. This protocol was sufficient to evoke significant IaK currents without activating significant endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− currents. The IaK amplitudes were measured at the end of the depolarizing voltage steps. The superfusing solution contained (mM): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (titrated with NaOH to pH 7.4). The microelectrodes were filled with 3 M KCl solution and had resistances between 0.6 and 1.3 megohms. Chemicals were added from stock solutions into the superfusion solution.

Science. 1988; 242: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) (r-) IaK proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes induced the characteristic slowly activating potassium current IaK during depolarizations to potentials more positive than −50 mV. Superfusion with H2O2 (3 mM) caused an inhibition of −50.1 ± 2.9% (n = 7; Fig. 1, B and C) and −62.2 ± 2.7% (n = 8) of h- and r-IaK within 15 min, respectively. Inhibition of IaK with H2O2 was enhanced by prolonged superfusion periods (>30 min). Addition of the reducing agent Dithioerythritol (DTE; 5 mM) completely reversed the H2O2-mediated inhibition. Moreover, DTE itself increased r- and h-IaK by 14.3 ± 3.5% (n = 4) and 31.0 ± 5.7% (n = 4), respectively, suggesting that a part of the IaK protein population may normally be oxidized. Analysis of r- and h-IaK revealed no alterations in the complex activation and deactivation kinetics of the currents by H2O2 (data not shown; n = 6 and 4, respectively). tert-Butylhydroperoxide (1 mM), another peroxide, reduced h-IaK within 10 min by −52.8 ± 5.7% (n = 4). The membrane-permeable, thiol group oxidizing reagent DTNP inhibited IaK similar to H2O2 (Fig. 1A), while the impermeable analog 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) had no effect. At a concentration of 100 μM, DTNP caused within 15 min a decrease of h- and r-IaK amplitude of −83.0 ± 1.0% (n = 5) and −76.4 ± 2.0% (n = 7), respectively, and almost completely suppressed h-IaK after an extended superfusion period (>30 min; n = 5). This inhibition was partially reversible during washout (to 47 and 61% of control r- and h-IaK) and was completely reversed by DTE (5 mM) (108.0 ± 7.5% of h- and 97 ± 3% of r-IaK; n = 5 and 7, respectively). These results suggest that IaK can be inhibited by intracellularly acting thiol-modifying agents. In the intracellular domain of the IaK protein resides a highly conserved Cys (1Takumi T. Ohkubo H.

Mutation of this Cys to a Ser in the r- and h-IaK protein (r-IaK C107S and h-IaK C106S) resulted in proteins, which induced upon expression in Xenopus oocytes potassium currents with similar general properties to the wild-type IaK under control conditions. However, as shown in Fig. 1D, mutation of Cys to Ser in the IaK protein abolished the inhibitory effect of H2O2. Under H2O2 (3 mM for 15 min) h-IaK C106S was 113.5 ± 5% of control (n = 7) and r-IaK C107S was 100.4 ± 2.1% of control (Fig. 1E; n = 6). Protein mutants, which lacked the intracellular part Ala-94 to Ser-130, induced IaK with the same general properties as the wild-type proteins(7Takumi T. Moriyoshi K. Aramori I. Ishii T. Oiki S. Okada Y. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22192-22198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the resulting current could also not be inhibited by H2O2 (n = 4; see Fig. 1E). These data suggest that IaK is negatively modulated by oxidation of a highly conserved intracellular Cys residue of the IaK protein. The inhibition may be caused by sequestration of IaK proteins and/or an impairment of mobility of the intracellular protein tail (see Fig. 5). There were no obvious changes in the rate of IaK activation after peroxide-mediated inhibition, which supports the hypothesis that after oxidation simply less IaK proteins can be recruited for channel formation. When the highly conserved Cys residue is substituted by an amino acid which cannot form disulfide-bonds or when it is simply deleted, the mutant protein cannot be sequestered by oxidation. In contrast to H2O2, the heavy metal Hg2+ not only oxidizes thiol groups but also causes the formation of chelates with dibasic amino acids. Superfusion with Hg2+ (1 μM) resulted in an use-dependent increase of the outward current amplitude to 221.2 ± 21.6% (n = 6) of control within 15 min, which was mainly the consequence of a retarded deactivation of IaK. Under repetitive stimulation the holding current at −80 mV shifted in outward direction and an instantaneous current appeared (Fig. 2, A, C, and F). Both time-dependent IaK and the instantaneous current under Hg2+ could be almost completely inhibited with the IaK blocker NE-10064 (5Busch A.E. Malloy K.J. Groh W. Varnum M.D. Adelman J.P. North R.A. Maylie J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, B, D, and G; n = 6), suggesting that the instantaneous currents were indeed currents through delayed deactivating IaK channels. These currents displayed an almost linear current-voltage relationship with reversal potentials of −95.9 ± 2.0 and −31.8 ± 3.4 mV (n = 4) under 2 and 20 mM extracellular K+, respectively, suggesting a high selectivity for K+ ions. The deactivation kinetics of r-IaK (at −80 mV) could be fitted to a single exponential function resulting in a deactivation time constant (τdeact) of 1.14 ± 0.17 s (n = 6). Under Hg2+, the deactivation of IaK was changed into two distinct events, the deactivation of time-dependently activating IaK (τdeact was 2.18 ± 0.23 s; n = 6), and a deactivation rate that was too slow to get precisely quantified (estimated τdeact > 1 min). Washout of Hg2+ reversed the IaK stabilizing effect and resulted in an inhibition of IaK compared to control (Fig. 2, A and C). The described positive regulatory effects of Hg2+ were strongly dependent on a prior activation of IaK. In contrast, when Hg2+ (1 μM for 20 min; see Fig. 3) was superfused in the absence of repetitive depolarizations (see Fig. 3), no alterations in the holding current (at −80 mV) were observed. The first depolarization after Hg2+ washout resulted in a reduced r-IaK (−66.1 ± 3.9%; n = 4). However, a subsequent second Hg2+ superfusion period during repetitive depolarizations (see Fig. 3) caused an increase of previously inhibited r-IaK and an outward shift of the holding current. The use-independent Hg2+-mediated IaK inhibition was also present in IaK protein mutants r-IaK C107S and h-IaK C106S (data not shown). We conclude, therefore, that other mechanisms than intracellular thiol group interaction is the main mechanism for this Hg2+-mediated IaK inhibition. However, the inhibitory mechanism of Hg2+-mediated IaK inhibition remains unclear. Because the predicted chelation with Hg2+ was very similar to the persistent activation of IaK previously described for organic, membrane-impermeable cross-linkers (11Varnum M.D. Busch A.E. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 64 (abstr.): A198Google Scholar) and the Cl− channel blocker DIDS and mefenamic acid(12Busch A.E. Herzer T. Wagner C. Schmidt F. Raber G. Waldegger S. Lang F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 750-753PubMed Google Scholar), binding of Hg2+ to the extracellular domain of the IaK protein was predicted. Two r-IaK protein mutants(7Takumi T. Moriyoshi K. Aramori I. Ishii T. Oiki S. Okada Y. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22192-22198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with deletions of amino acids 10-25 (r-IaK(del 10-25)) or 10-39 (r-IaK(del 10-39)) in the extracellular domain were subsequently tested for their sensitivity to Hg2+. Both mutants displayed similar general activation properties as wild-type r-IaK. However, while Hg2+ still positively regulated r-IaK(del 10-25) (Fig. 4, A and C), superfusion with Hg2+ resulted in an inhibition of IaK(del 10-39) of −38.7 ± 4.5% (Fig. 3, B and C). This result points to an interaction of Hg2+ with the extracellular IaK protein domain from amino acids 26-39. Hg2+ is known to form chelates with dibasic amino acids, and 3 out of 4 extracellular dibasic amino acids are located between amino acids 26 and 39, while no dibasic amino acid is present between amino acids 10 and 25. It is therefore possible that Hg2+ indeed forms chelates of IaK protein subunits by interacting with dibasic amino acids and that such chelation causes a stabilization of activated channels. The formation of such Hg2+-IaK protein chelates was dependent on prior activation of IaK, suggesting that during IaK activation a conformational change of the extracellular region occurs. However, it appears that only the mobility of the extracellular domain is important for IaK channel function but not the extracellular Hg2+ binding region itself, because the deletion of this domain does not render the channel nonfunctional. Similarly, it appears that also the mobility of the intracellular domain must be warranted for IaK channels to be functional. There, oxidation of a conserved Cys residue and the presumed formation of disulfide bonds may result in an impaired mobility of the intracellular tail, prompting the inhibition of IaK. Because this Cys residue is not necessary for normal IaK channel function, it may represent an “off-switch” for the IaK channel under certain pathophysiological conditions. Redox reactions at a Cys have also been shown to regulate the inactivation of neuronal IK(A) type potassium channels (13Ruppersberg J.P. Stocker M. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M. Nature. 1991; 352: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), but the physiological relevance of such regulation is not clear yet. However, in isolated heart models(14Woodward B. Zakaria M.N.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1985; 17: 485-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), peroxides were shown to account for reperfusion induced arrhythmias, and peroxides caused a strong inhibition of IKa combined with an action potential duration prolongation in isolated guinea pig cardiocytes(6Cerbai E. Ambrosio G. Porciatti F. Chiariello M. Giotti A. Mugelli A. Circulation. 1991; 84: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest that oxidation of the IaK protein participates in such events. The possible involvement of IaK proteins in the genesis of arrhythmias may shed a new light on their putative role as targets for novel antiarrhythmics(5Busch A.E. Malloy K.J. Groh W. Varnum M.D. Adelman J.P. North R.A. Maylie J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The results presented here cannot exclude the possibility that the IaK protein activates an endogenous oocyte potassium channel(15Attali B. Guillemare E. Lesage F. Honore E. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Nature. 1993; 365: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, there is accumulating evidence that the IaK protein is at least an integral part of a different type of potassium channel itself. It was demonstrated that the IaK protein itself represents the molecular basis for La3+ blockade(16Hice R. Folander K. Salata J.J. Smith J.S. Sanguinetti M.C. Swanson R. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 426: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), regulation through protein kinase C (17Busch A.E. Varnum M.D. North R.A. Adelman J.P.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that the IaK protein itself is the target for peroxide and Hg2+-mediated IaK regulation (Fig. 5). Recently, several studies have suggested that IaK protein density and/or mobility play a role for activation and deactivation of this unique K+ channel(11Varnum M.D. Busch A.E. Maylie J. Adelman J.P.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study suggest indeed that the mobility of the external and internal IaK protein domains is important for regular channel function. We are indebted to Drs. A. Müller, P.

https://openalex.org/W2069634089,"Abstract The N-terminal residues of the two heavy chains of the motor enzyme kinesin form two globular “heads”; the heads are attached to a “rod” domain which is a two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil. Interaction between the heads is thought to be important to kinesin function. The rod may not be necessary for head-head interactions because a heavy chain N-terminal fragment containing only residues from the head and adjacent region forms dimers (Huang, T.-G., Suhan, J., and Hackney, D. D.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16502-16507). However, the nature and stability of the subunit-subunit interactions in such derivatives are unclear. To examine the physical properties of heavy chain interaction in and near the head domains, we characterized the self-association behavior of two dimeric kinesin derivatives predicted (Lupas, A., van Dyke, M., and Stock, J.(1991) Science 252, 1162-1164) to lack the rod. Derivative K448-BIO contains the 448 N-terminal residues of Drosophila kinesin heavy chain fused at the C terminus to a 2-residue linker and a C-terminal fragment from Escherichia coli biotin carboxyl carrier protein; derivative K448-L is the same except that it lacks the biotin carboxyl carrier protein fragment. Both derivatives expressed in insect cells display microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity; K448-BIO also displays microtubule motility. Equilibrium sedimentation and gel filtration indicate that purified K448-BIO and K448-L at 0.02-0.4 mg/ml form homogeneous solutions of homodimers with no detectable formation of monomers or higher order oligomers. Derivative self-association is non-covalent but extremely stable with an association constant ≥2 × 108M. Stable subunit-subunit association induced by structures in and near the kinesin heads may be necessary for full mechanochemical function."
https://openalex.org/W2051899270,"Fluorescence steady-state and lifetime measurements have been performed that permit the differentiation of the 2 intrinsic tryptophan residues in bovine low molecular weight phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatase (BPTP). Spectral information was obtained by use of two single-tryptophan mutant proteins, W39F and W49F, and the double mutant protein W39,49F. Fluorescence measurements show that Trp39 is characterized by a large blue shift, a low quantum yield, and a shorter mean lifetime compared to Trp49. Solute fluorescence quenching studies of W39F reveal that Trp49 is highly exposed to the aqueous environment. In contrast, Trp39 is situated within a hydrophobic core and is only partially accessible to quenching agents such as acrylamide, iodide ion, and cesium ion. The fluorescence contributions of Trp39 and Trp49 are additive, and their sum is equivalent to that observed for wild type BPTP. Calculated intramolecular distances between Trp39 or Trp49 and a 5-[[(acetylamino)-ethyl]amino]naphthalene-1- sulfonate group covalently bound at Cys12 or Cys17 of the respective protein mutants, place Trp49 within 10 A and Trp39 at least 20 A from the active site. The fluorescence decay of the single tryptophan mutants and, surprisingly, wild type BPTP were each adequately fitted as biexponentials. The latter is a consequence of the imprecision involved in determining actual minima in a three- and four-exponential fitting. Comparison of quenching results of wild type BPTP with those of the single tryptophan mutant proteins indicates that minor fluorescence components, easily resolved using a biexponential fitting for the mutant proteins, are unresolvable for wild type BPTP. These minor components skewed the weighted magnitudes and induced perturbations in lifetimes for the tryptophan fluorescence of wild type BPTP, which directly influenced the calculated values of Ksv and kq."

Attention has focused on the role of the three COOH-terminal positions (+1 to +3) in generating specificity. Autophosphorylation of Tyr1021 in the tail of the β-receptor for platelet-derived growth factor creates a specific binding site for the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1. We show that the residues 4 and 5 amino acids COOH-terminal to Tyr1021 (+4 Leu and +5 Pro) are required for efficient PLC-γ1 binding, and that their replacement with the corresponding residues from a phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase binding site abrogates stable association with PLC-γ1. In contrast, replacement of the +3 Pro with Met produces a Tyr1021 site with mixed specificity that binds both PLC-γ1 and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase.

The Src and Lck SH2 domains, for example, bind preferentially to peptides with the sequence pTyr-Glu-Glu-Ile (pYEEI).

We have previously suggested that residues in addition to the 3 amino acids directly following the phosphotyrosine are required to stabilize the interaction between PLC-γ1 and the Tyr1021 autophosphorylation site of the β-receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (β-PDGFR)(14Larose L.

This notion has received support from structural analysis of the COOH-terminal PLC-γ1 SH2 domain (C-SH2) and the NH2-terminal Syp phosphotyrosine phosphatase SH2 domain both of which possess an extended hydrophobic groove that accommodates the +1 to +3 hydrophobic peptide residues, as well as residues in the +4 and +5 positions(15Pascal S.M.

For example, PLC-γ1 binds the receptor upon phosphorylation of Tyr1021 in the C-terminal tail(14Larose L. Gish G. Shoelson S. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2493-2499PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rönnstrand L. Mori S. Arridsson A.-K. Eriksson A. Wernstedt C. Hellman V. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H.

Substitution of this Tyr with Phe abrogates PLC-γ1-binding and PDGF-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, but has no effect on binding of other SH2-containing signaling proteins(27Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). However, mounting evidence suggests that not all SH2-binding sites are specific for a single signaling protein. For example, both Nck and PI3K reportedly bind Tyr10211021 in the β-PDGFR(28Nishimura R. Li W. Kashishian A. Mondino A. Zhon M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the Met receptor tyrosine kinase, two closely spaced tyrosine residues bind multiple SH2-containing proteins, suggesting that a single tyrosine phosphorylation site might under some circumstances couple to multiple signaling pathways(29Ponzetto C.

Using the PLC-γ1 binding site of the β-PDGFR, we have investigated the determinants that restrict a phosphotyrosine-containing site to a single binding partner, or can allow binding to multiple SH2 proteins. The kinase insert (residues 698-797) and the carboxyl-terminal tail (residues 953-1103) were generated by the polymerase chain reaction using the human β-PDGF receptor as a template(30Claesson-Welsh L.

Point mutations were generated by overlapping extension using polymerase chain reaction(31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). In vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of GST fusion proteins was produced by bacterial infection with a λgt 11 phage containing the Elk tyrosine kinase domain(32Lhotak V. Greer P. Letwin K. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2496-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were isolated using glutathione beads and their tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed following their separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies(33Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar). The level of phosphorylation of the GST fusion proteins on tyrosine residues was then determined with 125125I-protein A and autoradiography. Confluent Rat-2 cells overexpressing PLC-γ1 (34Sultzman L. Ellis C. Lin L.-L. Pawson T. Knopf J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2018-2025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were lysed in PLC lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 10 μg ml-1 leupeptin, 10 μg ml-1 aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μM sodium vanadate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mM sodium fluoride). The clarified lysate was incubated with immobilized tyrosine-phosphorylated GST fusion proteins (1-3 μg/ml) for 60 min at 4°C, the beads were washed with HNTG buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 200 μM sodium vanadate, 10 μg ml-1 aprotinin, 10 μg ml-1 leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and associated proteins were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-PLC-γ1 antibodies to residues 1064-1291 of bovine PLC-γ1 (35Decker S.J. Ellis C. Pawson T. Velu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7009-7015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-p85α antibodies to residues 2-83 of bovine p85α and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) or 125125I-protein A was used to detect the signal. In vitro association of PLC-γ1 with the GST fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal portion of the PDGF receptor was competed by increasing concentrations of pY1021, a 12-amino acid phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 1018-1029 of the PDGF receptor (DNDpYIIPLPDPK)(30Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Moren A Severinsson L. Ek B. Ostman A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Competition experiments were also performed with variant pY1021 peptides containing alanine substitution at positions +4 or +5 relative to Tyr1021. A phosphopeptide with the sequence SSNpYMAPYDNY corresponding to the binding site for GAP on the PDGF receptor (peptide pY771) (36Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a control. Peptides were prepared on an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer using Fmoc chemistry with HBTU activation, deprotected by 1 M TMSBr/trifluoroacetic acid treatment for 4 h at 0°C, and isolated by ether precipitation as outlined by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City). Phosphotyrosine was incorporated using the reagent Fmoc-Tyr(PO3Me2)-OH (Bachem Bioscience). The peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and their composition confirmed by mass spectroscopic analysis. The amount of PLC-γ1 bound was detected by immunoblotting with specific anti-PLC-γ1 antibodies and 125125I-protein A. The radioactive signal was quantified using a PhosphoImager scanner and the data were normalized according to the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-PDGF receptor tail used in each assay. cDNA fragments corresponding to the SH2 domains of bovine PLC-γ1 N-SH2 (residues 545-659), C-SH2 (residues 663-759), and N+C-SH2 (residues 545-759) were isolated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX-kt, a bacterial expression vector. GST fusion proteins were produced, purified, and eluted from glutathione-agarose beads as described earlier(37Gish G. Shen R. Larose L. Pawson T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Biosensor-based analysis of wild type and variant pY1021 phosphopeptides interacting with PLC-γ1 N-SH2, C-SH2, and N+C-SH2 domains were conducted as described previously(37Gish G. Shen R. Larose L. Pawson T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 38Marengere L.E.M. Songyang Z. Gish G.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Stern M.J. Cantley L.C. Pawson T. Nature. 1994; 369: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The PLC-γ1-binding site at Tyr1021 in the tail of the β-PDGFR is contained within the sequence pYIIPLPD(30Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Moren A Severinsson L. Ek B. Ostman A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In contrast, the SH2 domains of the PI3K p85 subunit bind Tyr740740 and Tyr10211021 in the kinase insert, which conform to the consensus for PI3K-binding, pYXXM(10Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chadhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E.F. Chou M.M. Harafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

GST fusion proteins containing the kinase insert or COOH-terminal tail of the β-PDGFR were phosphorylated on tyrosine, and incubated with lysates of Rat-2 fibroblasts. Under these conditions, the kinase insert binds the p85 subunit of PI3K, but not PLC-γ1 (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1). In contrast, the tail binds PLC-γ1 but fails to associate with PI3K (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 2). To investigate which residues COOH-terminal to Tyr1021 in the tail were required for specific PLC-γ1 binding, the residues at the +3, +4, and +5 positions were substituted with the amino acids found at the corresponding positions of the Tyr740740 PI3K-binding site (which has the sequence pYMDMSKD). Hence, the +3 Pro of the Tyr1021 PLC-γ1-binding site was changed to Met, the +4 Leu to Ser, and the +5 Pro to Lys, within the context of the GST tail fusion protein. Since both PLC-γ1 and PI3K binding sites have Asp at +6, this residue was changed to Ala. Wild type and mutant fusion proteins were expressed and phosphorylated on tyrosine to similar levels as described under “Materials and Methods,” and assayed for binding to PLC-γ1 and PI3K. Substitution of the +3 Pro by Met, to yield a β-PDGFR tail with the sequence pY1021IIMLPD, had little discernible effect on PLC-γ1-binding (Fig. 1C). In contrast, substitutions of the +4 Leu to Ser (to give pYIIPSPD) or the +5 Pro to Lys (to pYIIPLKD) both greatly reduced PLC-γ1 binding activity (Fig. 1C). Substitution of the +6 Asp by Ala had no detectable effect in these assays. These results indicate that the +4 and +5 residues of the β-PDGFR Tyr1021 site are both important for high affinity PLC-γ1 binding. In each case their replacement with amino acids from the cognate positions of the PI3K-binding site effectively abolished high affinity binding to PLC-γ1, but did not induce PI3K binding (data not shown). However, replacing the +3 Pro with Met had little effect on PLC-γ1 binding, but induced a novel binding activity for the p85 subunit of PI3K (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 3). Substitution of the +3 Pro with Met therefore appears to broaden the binding specificity of the Tyr1021 site by increasing its affinity for PI3K, without markedly affecting binding to PLC-γ1. Although the SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 and p85 select phosphopeptides with different amino acids at the +1 to +3 positions from a degenerate peptide library screen, they both bind preferentially to hydrophobic residues at +1 and +3(10Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chadhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E.F. Chou M.M. Harafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, they both possess a Cys or Ile at SH2 residue βD5, which appears to be diagnostic of SH2 domains that bind residues COOH-terminal to the phosphotyrosine in a hydrophobic groove(10Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chadhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E.F. Chou M.M. Harafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar). This being the case, it seems likely that the PLC-γ1 SH2 domains can accommodate a +3 Met in the phosphopeptide ligand without substantial loss in binding affinity, provided that the appropriate residues are present at the +4 and +5 positions. Although it does not inhibit PLC-γ1 binding, this substitution does create a PI3K-binding site, consistent with the observation that the binding of p85 SH2 domains is particularly dependent on a +3 Met. The residues normally present at the +4 and +5 positions of the PLC-γ1-binding site are apparently compatible with PI3K, once a +3 Met has been introduced. Consistent with this observation, a β-PDGFR tail mutant in which the +1 to +3 residues of the PLC-γ1-binding site are converted from Ile-Ile-Pro to Met-Asp-Met (i.e.pYMDMLPD) binds both PLC-γ1 and p85 (Fig. 2). These results predict that further substitution of the pYMDMLPD sequence at the +4 position, by replacement of the +4 Pro with a Ser, should discriminate against PLC-γ1 but not against PI3K, and thereby create a p85-specific binding site. Fig. 2 shows that the phosphorylated β-PDGFR tail containing the sequence pYMDMSPD binds p85, but shows no detectable PLC-γ1 binding activity. These data indicate that PLC-γ1 does not bind to the Tyr740740 PI3K-binding site in the kinase insert because the +4 and +5 residues in the natural PI3K site antagonize association with PLC-γ1. To investigate in more detail the notion that the residues at the +4 and +5 positions of the Tyr1021β-PDGFR autophosphorylation site are important for binding to PLC-γ1, we synthesized phosphopeptides corresponding to the Tyr1021 site (residues 1018-1029 of the β-PDGFR). These peptides contained either the wild type residues, or variant sequences in which the +4 Leu or +5 Pro were replaced with Ala. The wild type and variant phosphopeptides were analyzed for their ability to compete for the binding of the phosphorylated β-PDGFR tail to PLC-γ1 (Fig. 3A). The wild type phosphopeptide inhibited binding of PLC-γ1 to the phosphorylated tail of the β-PDGFR with an IC50 of approximately 10 nM, reflecting a high affinity interaction. In contrast, a variant peptide with Ala at +4 was about 16-fold less efficient in competing with the β-PDGFR tail for binding to PLC-γ1 (IC50, 160 nM). Substitution of the +5 Pro by Ala resulted in a 3-fold decrease in peptide inhibition of PLC-γ1 binding to the β-PDGFR tail (IC50, 30 nM). When the data were expressed as the relative percent of PLC-γ1 bound in the absence of phosphopeptide, all three competition curves showed a Hill coefficient of 1.0, suggesting only one site of interaction for PLC-γ1 on the β-PDGFR tail (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with the fact that in a previous study(14Larose L. Gish G. Shoelson S. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2493-2499PubMed Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that Tyr1021 in the GST-PDGF receptor tail was the major phosphorylation site by the Elk kinase domain in the bacterial cells. Finally, these results indicate that the residues at the +4 and +5 positions of the Tyr1021 site are indeed required for optimal binding, and cannot be replaced even with another hydrophobic residue without affecting SH2-binding efficiency. The experiments discussed above employed full-length PLC-γ1 isolated from fibroblast cell lysates. Since the binding of PLC-γ1 to the phosphorylated β-PDGFR tail is apparently mediated by one or the other of the two PLC-γ1 SH2 domains, we have directly measured the association of these SH2 domains with a phosphopeptide containing the Tyr1021 site. For this purpose, wild type Tyr1021 phosphopeptide was immobilized on the sensor chip of a Pharmacia BIAcore instrument(37Gish G. Shen R. Larose L. Pawson T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 38Marengere L.E.M. Songyang Z. Gish G.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Stern M.J. Cantley L.C. Pawson T. Nature. 1994; 369: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance was used to measure the binding of these immobilized phosphopeptides to bacterial GST fusion proteins containing the PLC-γ1 NH2-terminal SH2 domain (N-SH2), the COOH-terminal SH2 domain (C-SH2), or both SH2 domains together (N+C-SH2). The combined N+C-SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 bound the wild type Tyr1021 peptide with the highest affinity (Table 1). When the two SH2 domains were examined individually, substantial differences in their affinities for the wild type β-PDGFR phosphopeptide were observed. The C-SH2 domain bound Tyr1021 with a higher affinity than the N-SH2 domain (Table 1). These results suggest that the COOH-terminal SH2 domain is primarily responsible for specific PLC-γ1-binding to the Tyr1021 autophosphorylation site in the tail of the β-PDGFR, and are consistent with predictions based on screening of a degenerate phosphopeptide library(10Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chadhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E.F. Chou M.M. Harafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this finding strengthens the value of models based on the NMR structure of the PLC-γ1 C-SH2 domain complexed to a phosphopeptide representing the β-PDGFR Tyr1021 autophosphorylation site(15Pascal S.M. Singer A.U. Gish G. Yamazaki T. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Forman-Kay J.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, these results suggest that the two SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 might be acting cooperatively to support optimal affinity binding of PLC-γ1 to the β-PDGF receptor in vivo.Table I Open table in a new tab To assess the importance of residues at positions +4 and +5 in the Tyr1021 phosphopeptide for the binding of the combined N+C-SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 using the BIAcore system, Tyr1021 phosphopeptides with alanine substitutions at the +4 or +5 positions were used. Substitution of Leu for Ala at position +4 decreased the affinity of this peptide for N+C-SH2 domains by about 10-fold (Table 1). Substitution of Pro by Ala at position +5 resulted in a 2-fold decrease in binding affinity for GST-SH2 fusion protein containing both SH2 domains (Table 1). The principal kinetic effect of the +4 and +5 substitutions was on the off-rate (data not shown). These results indicate that the isolated SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 bind with relatively high affinity to a phosphopeptide spanning the Tyr1021 site of the β-PDGFR. In addition, substituting residues +4 and +5 with Ala had similar effects on binding to isolated PLC-γ1 SH2 domains, measured by surface plasmon resonance, and association with full-length PLC-γ1, assessed by competition with the phosphorylated β-PDGFR tail. Similar results were obtained when residue +5 Pro was substituted by Lys. However, a 100-fold decrease in affinity was observed when the +4 Leu residue was substituted for Ser instead of Ala (data not shown). The results presented here suggest that the control of SH2 domain binding specificity is more complex than previously supposed. By manipulating the sequence of the residues COOH-terminal to the PLC-γ1-binding site in the tail of the β-PDGFR, we have been able to change a site that is initially specific for PLC-γ1 and does not recognize PI3K, to a site with mixed binding specificity that complexes with both PLC-γ1 and PI3K. Further alteration creates a site that is specific for PI3K, and does not bind stably to PLC-γ1 (Table 2). Binding of PI3K appears especially sensitive to the presence of a Met in the +3 position, while PLC-γ1-binding is also modulated by the +4 and +5 residues. The data presented here suggest that the natural PI3K-binding site at Tyr740740 of the β-PDGF receptor has two elements involved in specificity. The residues at +1 and +3, especially the +3 Met, induce high affinity binding to PI3K. In contrast, the residues at +4 and +5 do not appear of particular importance for PI3K binding, but contribute to specificity by repelling other SH2-containing proteins that might otherwise bind this site, such as PLC-γ1. It is of interest in this regard that IRS-1, which upon phosphorylation binds PI3K but not PLC-γ1(39Lavan B.E. Kuhne M.R. Garner C.W. Anderson D. Reedijk M. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11631-11636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has nine YXXM motifs of which four have Ser at the +4 position(40Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). None of these sites has a +4 Leu. The two preferential PI3K-binding sites on IRS-1, at Tyr608 and Tyr939(41Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have Ser and Asp at the +4 position, respectively. These results suggest a means by which SH2-binding sites can be tailored to be either specific, as seen in the β-PDGFR, or promiscuous, as in the Met receptor.Table II Open table in a new tab We thank Dr. M.

https://openalex.org/W1973858964,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6) encodes a protein expressed during inflammation. We have previously shown that transcription factors of the NF-IL6 and AP-1 families cooperatively modulate activation of the TSG-6 gene by TNF or interleukin 1 (IL-1) through a promoter region that contains an NF-IL6 site (−106 to −114) and an AP-1 element (−126 to −119). In this study we report the identification of an additional NF-IL6 site (NF-IL6∗) located at positions −92 to −83. Footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that NF-IL6 binds with higher affinity to the newly identified NF-IL6∗ site than to the earlier identified promoter-distal NF-IL6 site and that the two sites cooperate in binding NF-IL6. TNF and IL-1 stimulate specific binding of nuclear proteins to the NF-IL6∗ site more efficiently than to the promoter-distal NF-IL6 site. Moreover, a mutation in the NF-IL6∗ site abolished transactivation of the TSG-6 promoter by NF-IL6 despite the presence of the intact promoter-distal NF-IL6 site. A mutation in the promoter-distal NF-IL6 site also greatly decreased activation of the TSG-6 promoter by NF-IL6.

A mutation in the promoter-distal NF-IL6 site also greatly decreased activation of the TSG-6 promoter by NF-IL6. We conclude that the two NF-IL6 sites are functionally interdependent in the activation of the TSG-6 gene. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorTSG-6TNF-stimulated gene 6IL-1interleukin 1NF-IL6nuclear factor for the IL-6 geneEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase.-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6) encodes an inducible secreted protein that shows partial structural homology to members of a family of hyaluronan-binding proteins(1Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.-G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A role for TSG-6 in inflammation is suggested by the presence of high concentrations of TSG-6 protein in the synovial fluid of arthritis patients(2Wisniewski H.-G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6593-6601PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of TSG-6 is tightly regulated at the level of transcription, with its synthesis rapidly induced by the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1 and by bacterial lipopolysaccharide in normal human fibroblasts, mononuclear cells, chondrocytes, and synovial cells(2Wisniewski H.-G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6593-6601PubMed Google Scholar). TSG-6 is a primary response gene because its transcriptional activation by TNF in human FS-4 fibroblasts was not reduced in the presence of cycloheximide(3Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that the regulation of the native TSG-6 promoter by cytokine-generated signals is complex. The region between −163 and −58 confers inducibility to the TSG-6 gene by TNF and IL-1(3Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an NF-IL6 site (−106 to −114) within this region is indispensable for activation by both cytokines(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The NF-IL6 site mediates activation of the TSG-6 promoter by NF-IL6(4Klampfer L.

Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), activation of the native TSG-6 promoter by NF-IL6 is modulated by the ratio of the activator to inhibitor isoforms of NF-IL6(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An AP-1 site within this cytokine-responsive region (−126 to −119), adjacent to the NF-IL6 site, is also essential for activation by TNF, and it enhances induction by IL-1(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Activation via the AP-1 site is mediated by Fos/Jun family members. However, the AP-1 site also binds the inhibitor isoform of NF-IL6, which can inhibit AP-1 site-mediated transcription of the TSG-6 gene(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 1992; 66: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analogous to its rodent counterpart, the human NF-IL6 gene lacks introns, but it encodes three proteins (NF-IL6-1, NF-IL6-2, and NF-IL6-3) that are translated from in-frame AUGs of the same mRNA species(6Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 7Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). NF-IL6 dimers regulate target genes by binding through the basic leucine zipper regions to specific NF-IL6 recognition sequences(9Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U.

Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Stimulation by cytokines and retinoic acid leads to an increase in the activator forms, suggesting that alteration in the ratio of activator to inhibitor forms of NF-IL6 is one of the means by which this transcription factor mediates responses to cytokines(13Hsu W. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, NF-IL6 associates in vitro with proteins of other transcription factor families, such as NF-κB(14Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc.

The possibility that interactions between NF-IL6 and AP-1 play a physiologic role is supported by the finding that the interaction between NF-IL6 and Jun in vivo is regulated by IL-6. 2W. Hsu, T. K. Kerppola, T. Curran, and S. Chen-Kiang, manuscript in preparation. Recent evidence from studies of promoters from several IL-1- and IL-6-responsive genes shows that multiple NF-IL6 recognition sites are functionally important for their activation by cytokines(11Spergel J.M. Hsu W. Akira S. Thimmappaya B. Kishimoto T. Chen-Kiang S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nishio Y. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Mol. Cell.

Rom W.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3831-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we identify a hitherto uncharacterized NF-IL6 binding site in the TSG-6 promoter. We show that this site binds NF-IL6 more efficiently than the previously identified NF-IL6 site and that the two NF-IL6 sites are functionally interdependent in mediating the activation of the TSG-6 gene. This functional interdependence distinguishes the interaction of the two adjacent NF-IL6 sites in the TSG-6 promoter from some other promoters in which two NF-IL6 binding sites are either mutually antagonistic (11Spergel J.M. Hsu W. Akira S. Thimmappaya B. Kishimoto T. Chen-Kiang S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nishio Y. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Mol. Cell.

Normal human FS-4 fibroblasts were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 5% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human TNF-α was provided by M. Tsujimoto of the Suntory Institute for Biochemical Research, Osaka, Japan. E. coli-derived recombinant human IL-1α was a gift of A. Stern and P. Lomedico, Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ. The reporter plasmid pBBCAT contains the −165 to −78 region of the TSG-6 promoter, linked to the CAT gene(3Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-deletions of pBBCAT (see Fig. 3A) were generated by the exonuclease III/S1 nuclease method(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the TSG-6 promoter was performed according to Deng and Nickoloff (23Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequencing(24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52648) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers were designed to introduce mutations into the promoter-distal NF-IL6 site and the NF-IL6∗ site (Fig. 1). A selection primer (CCAGTGCCAcGCgTGCATGCCTG) was used to convert the unique HindIII restriction site in the pBBCAT vector into a MluI site(23Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The NF-IL6 expression vector (pCMV-NF-IL6) contains a full-length NF-IL6 cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter(12Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio T.

All three NF-IL6 isoforms translated from in-frame AUGs of the same mRNA species (termed NF-IL6-1, NF-IL6-2, and NF-IL6-3) are expressed by this vector in mammalian cells(7Hsu W. Kerppola T.K.

Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl at room temperature for 30 min, and the samples were then subjected to DNaseI digestion (0.1 units/reaction, Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 min on ice. The reactions were stopped by the addition of a buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mM NaCl, 1% sodium sarcosyl, 10 mM EDTA (pH 8), and 25 μg/ml of calf thymus DNA. After phenol-chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated with ethanol, vacuum dried, and analyzed on a 8% urea acrylamide gel. The G+A sequencing ladder was prepared according to Maxam and Gilbert(25Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9012) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from FS-4 cells that were untreated or stimulated with TNF (20 ng/ml) or IL-1 (1 ng/ml) for 2 h as described previously(7Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 4 μg of nuclear proteins were used in each binding reaction. Recombinant GST-NF-IL6-3 fusion protein (7Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was used at the concentrations indicated. Binding reactions were performed in 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mM NaCl, 15 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol at 37°C for 15 min. Poly(dI-dC) (1 μg) was added, and the incubation was continued for 5 min before the addition of the radiolabeled DNA probe (20,000 cpm). The protein-DNA complexes formed were separated from the free probe by electrophoresis in a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25% TBE buffer (22 mM Tris base, 22 mM borate, 0.625 mM EDTA). The oligonucleotides used in EMSA, corresponding to the promoter-distal NF-IL6 site, NF-IL6∗ site, and AP-1 site, are shown in Fig. 2. HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method(3Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in 100-mm dishes at approximately 70% confluence were transfected with 20 μg of pBBCAT reporter plasmid alone or together with 1 or 5 μg of pCMV-NF-IL6. Cell lysates were prepared and assayed for CAT activity 24 h after transfection(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All quantifications of CAT activity were performed with the aid of the Ambis radioactive imaging system (Ambis, Inc., San Diego, CA). Previously we have shown that an NF-IL6 binding site (5′-TGAAGCAAA-3′, at positions −106 to −114) is essential for transactivation of the TSG-6 promoter by NF-IL6 and for its transcriptional activation by TNF and IL-1(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analysis of the binding of recombinant NF-IL6 protein to the HindIII-ScaI fragment (−165 to −58) of the native TSG-6 promoter (Fig. 3A) by EMSA revealed the formation of three protein-DNA complexes, C1, C2, and C3 (Fig. 3B). The C1 complex was not formed when a 5′-deletion construct lacking the CCAAT box (PBD4) was used as a source of the probe, suggesting that C1 complex formation requires the CCAAT motif. The AP-1 site appears not to be essential for the formation of C2 and C3 complexes because the same mobility shift pattern was observed with a probe lacking the AP-1 site (PBD56). Deletion of the NF-IL6 site (pBD7) abolished the formation of the C2 complex; however, formation of the C3 complex was not affected, suggesting that there is an additional NF-IL6 binding site located downstream of the −106 to −114 NF-IL6 site. Footprinting analysis with recombinant GST-NF-IL6-3 protein localized a region protected from DNase I digestion between positions −100 and −80 (Fig. 4A). Within this region we found an NF-IL6-like sequence (5′-TTGTGTAAC-3′) spanning nucleotides −92 to −84 (Fig. 4B). The lack of protection of the previously identified promoter-distal NF-IL6 site is most likely due to its relatively lower affinity for the NF-IL6 protein (see below). The newly identified NF-IL6 site at positions −92 to −84 in the TSG-6 promoter, designated NF-IL6∗ (5′-TTGTGTAAC-3′), differs from the NF-IL6 binding consensus sequence (T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G)) in one position and is separated from the promoter-distal NF-IL6 site by only 13 base pairs. We prepared a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the NF-IL6∗ site and used it as a probe in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 5A, this site binds recombinant NF-IL6 efficiently in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 2-4). Competition with the unlabeled promoter-distal NF-IL6 oligonucleotide (lane 5) or NF-IL6∗ oligonucleotide (lane 6) suggested that the NF-IL6∗ site competed for NF-IL6 binding more efficiently than the 5′ NF-IL6 site. Supershift with antibody to NF-IL6 confirmed that the complex is NF-IL6-specific (lane 7). We compared the two NF-IL6 sites also by incubating increasing amounts of NF-IL6 protein with the same amounts of the 5′ NF-IL6 or NF-IL6∗ oligonucleotide that were labeled to comparable specific activities (Fig. 5B). This experiment confirmed that the NF-IL6∗ site binds NF-IL6 more efficiently than the 5′ NF-IL6 site (compare lanes 2-4 and 7-9). Earlier we showed that treatment of FS-4 cells with TNF or IL-1 increased nuclear protein binding to the AP-1 site in the TSG-6 promoter(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine if protein binding to the NF-IL6 sites is also regulated by TNF and IL-1, we prepared nuclear proteins from TNF- or IL-1-treated FS-4 cells and analyzed their binding to both NF-IL6 sites. Nuclei from unstimulated cells contained a small amount of protein that bound to the NF-IL6∗ probe (Fig. 6, lane 2), but no constitutive binding to the 5′ NF-IL6 oligonucleotide was detected (lane 9). Treatment of cells with either TNF or IL-1 increased the binding of nuclear protein to NF-IL6∗ (lanes 3 and 4) as well as to the 5′ NF-IL6 site (lanes 10 and 11). Formation of protein-NF-IL6∗ complexes was inhibited by competition with a molar excess of the unlabeled 5′ NF-IL6 oligonucleotide (lane 5) and cold NF-IL6∗ oligonucleotide (lane 6). In contrast, competition with the unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide did not interfere with formation of the protein-DNA complex (lane 7). These results suggest that TNF and IL-1 enhance NF-IL6 binding to the NF-IL6∗ site and, though less efficiently, also to the 5′ NF-IL6 site. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to further evaluate the binding of NF-IL6 protein to the two NF-IL6 sites in the TSG-6 promoter. Probes with both NF-IL6 sites unaltered and probes with mutations introduced into one of the two NF-IL6 sites were used in EMSA. Complexes C1, C2, and C3 were formed with a probe from the wild type TSG-6 promoter (Fig. 7). A significant reduction in the formation of all three complexes was seen with a probe that contained a mutated promoter-distal NF-IL6 site (NF-IL6 M). The formation of all three complexes was abolished in EMSA with a probe containing a mutated NF-IL6∗ site (NF-IL6∗ M), despite the presence of the unaltered 5′ NF-IL6 site. These results suggest cooperative binding of NF-IL6 by the two NF-IL6 elements and show that the NF-IL6∗ site is essential for NF-IL6 binding. Having shown that both NF-IL6 sites bind NF-IL6, albeit with different efficiencies, we examined the relative importance of the two sites for transactivation of the TSG-6 promoter by NF-IL6. HeLa cells were cotransfected with the NF-IL6 expression vector (pCMV-NF-IL6) together with a CAT reporter gene linked to one of the following: the wild-type TSG-6 promoter (pBBCAT, WT), the same region containing a mutated 5′ NF-IL6 site (NF-IL6 M), or a mutated NF-IL6∗ site (NF-IL6∗ M). Disruption of the 5′ NF-IL6 site strongly reduced transactivation, and mutation in the NF-IL6∗ site virtually abolished transactivation by NF-IL6 (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that the two NF-IL6 sites are functionally interdependent and that both sites are needed for efficient transactivation by NF-IL6. In earlier reports we described the cloning of the 5′ regulatory region of the TSG-6 gene and identified some of the cis-acting elements necessary for its inducibility(3Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis showed that an AP-1 (−126 to −119) and an NF-IL6 (−106 to −114) site are important in TSG-6 gene activation by the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1 (4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The integrity of both the AP-1 and NF-IL6 sites was essential for inducibility by TNF, whereas induction by IL-1 required the NF-IL6 site and was greatly enhanced by the AP-1 site. In the present study we identified a second NF-IL6 binding site in the TSG-6 promoter at positions −92 to −83, separated from the earlier-identified promoter-distal NF-IL6 site by only 13 base pairs. We show that the two NF-IL6 sites cooperate in NF-IL6 binding and that both sites are essential for transactivation of the TSG-6 promoter. Thus, there are at least three interacting elements that control the induced expression of the TSG-6 gene: two NF-IL6 sites and an AP-1 element. Several other promoters are known to harbor two NF-IL6 sites. Activation of the IL-1β gene promoter by lipopolysaccharide and TNF was shown to be mediated by two adjacent NF-IL6 elements; a mutation in either one of these sites did not interfere with the function of the other site, whereas a mutation in both sites abolished activation(21Zhang Y. Rom W.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3831-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the IL-6 gene promoter, two NF-IL6 sites exert a positive regulatory activity and can act independently, although the 5′ NF-IL6 site was demonstrably less important than the 3′ NF-IL6 site(20Zhang Y. Broser M. Rom W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2225-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The IL-6 gene promoter retained significant transcriptional activity even if mutations were introduced into both NF-IL6 sites; this residual activity was shown to be mediated by a potent NF-κB element located downstream of the two NF-IL6 sites(20Zhang Y. Broser M. Rom W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2225-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Lin J.-X. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3818-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the E1A-responsive adenovirus E2ae promoter, a promoter-proximal NF-IL6-responsive site functions as a dominant negative regulatory site, whereas a promoter-distal NF-IL6 recognition sequence is positively or negatively regulated by NF-IL6 depending on the composition of NF-IL6 isoforms(11Spergel J.M. Hsu W. Akira S. Thimmappaya B. Kishimoto T. Chen-Kiang S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in the promoter of the acute phase reactant α1-acid glycoprotein, two NF-IL6 sites were shown to function in an antagonistic manner; the promoter-distal NF-IL6 site was inhibitory, whereas the proximal NF-IL6 element was stimulatory in response to a combined activation with transfected glucocorticoid receptor and NF-IL6(17Nishio Y.

Multiple binding sites for NF-IL6 are also found in the long terminal repeat of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1(27Tesmer V.M. Rajadhyaksha A. Babin J. Bina M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7298-7302Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and in the promoters of the genes encoding human haptoglobin(28Oliviero S. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), human C-reactive protein(29Toniatti C. Demartis A. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4467-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the third component of complement(30Wilson D.R. Juan T.S.-C. Wilde M.D. Fey G.H. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6181-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the functional interplay of these NF-IL6 motifs has not been analyzed. Thus, the TSG-6 promoter is unique among the promoters known to contain two NF-IL6 sites in that mutation of either site virtually abolished activation (Fig. 8). TSG-6 is a single copy gene, located on human chromosome 2(3Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although its exact function is not yet known, high concentrations of TSG-6 protein are found in the joint fluids of arthritis patients, and synovial cells from arthritic joints synthesize TSG-6 mRNA and protein (2Wisniewski H.-G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6593-6601PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, TSG-6 protein was not detectable in the synovial fluids of individuals with no known history of arthritis. Elevated TSG-6 protein was also found in sera of patients with bacterial sepsis and of human volunteers injected with lipopolysaccharide (2Wisniewski H.-G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6593-6601PubMed Google Scholar). 3H.-G. Wisniewski, A. F. Suffredini, and J. Vilcek, unpublished observations. A role for TSG-6 in inflammation and the acute phase response is also supported by the recent demonstration that TSG-6 protein forms a stable complex with inter-α-inhibitor, a serine protease inhibitor present in normal plasma(32Wisniewski H.-G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TSG-6 expression is tightly regulated, as judged by the absence of detectable constitutive expression in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts and most other types of cells examined(1Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.-G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Wisniewski H.-G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Vilcek J. J.

However, high concentrations of TSG-6 protein are produced upon appropriate stimulation. Thus, the design of the TSG-6 promoter must be such that little or no TSG-6 expression takes place in unstimulated cells, whereas a high level of synthesis can be rapidly reached during inflammation. The presence of two interdependent positively acting NF-IL6 sites appears to fulfill these requirements for tight repression and a rapid, efficient upregulation of synthesis. Another important feature of the TSG-6 promoter is the presence of an AP-1 site, separated from the 5′ NF-IL6 site by only 4 base pairs (Fig. 4B). Earlier we showed that a mutation in the AP-1 site (or its deletion) abolished the response to TNF and significantly decreased inducibility by IL-1(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation via the AP-1 site is likely mediated by Fos/Jun proteins because treatment of cells with TNF or IL-1 increased nuclear protein binding to the AP-1 site of the TSG-6 promoter, and the formation of the complex was prevented by antibodies to Fos and Jun(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Yet, the AP-1 site is insufficient to mediate efficient transcriptional activation of the TSG-6 promoter because a mutation in any one of the two NF-IL6 elements virtually abolished promoter activation by NF-IL6, despite the presence of the intact AP-1 site (Fig. 8). The AP-1 site may also play a role in the negative regulation of TSG-6 gene expression. We have shown that the inhibitor isoform of NF-IL6 can bind directly to the AP-1 site in the TSG-6 gene and, thereby, at high concentration, repress transcriptional activation(4Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6561-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, NF-IL6 protein can form heterodimeric complexes with Fos or Jun through their respective basic leucine zipper regions, resulting in a repression of transcriptional activation by NF-IL6(7Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Whether the latter mechanism operates in the negative regulation of the TSG-6 promoter has not been directly demonstrated. Thus, a striking feature of the TSG-6 promoter is the close proximity and interdependence of its three major enhancer elements: two NF-IL6 sites and an AP-1 motif. We thank Wei Hsu for providing recombinant NF-IL6 protein, Paul Schwenger and Anne Altmeyer for helpful discussions, Angel Feliciano for technical assistance, and Ilene Totillo for preparation of the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W1603933406,"SH2 and SH3 domains have been characterized as functional domains that mediate protein-protein interactions in signal transduction. Recently, the cDNA sequence of a novel Src- and Fyn-binding protein called AFAP-110, for Actin-Filament Associated Protein-110 kDa, was reported. This protein was distinctive in that it is both an SH2 and SH3 binding partner for the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src and Fyn.

SH2 and SH3 domains are recognized as conserved functional domains found in a variety of proteins known to play an important role in signal transduction, including the src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, phospholipase C-γ, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(1Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain mediates protein-protein interactions by recognizing and binding to peptide motifs that contain a phosphotyrosine residue(1Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The function of the SH3 domain is less clear(2Musacchio A. Gibson T. Lehto V.-P. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This domain, unlike the SH2 domain, is also found in proteins known to interact with the cytoskeleton and cell membrane(3Rodaway A.R.F. Sternberg M.J.E. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1989; 342: 624Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Drubin D.G. Mulholland J. Zhu Z. Botstein D. Nature. 1990; 343: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Hence, the SH3 domain has been hypothesized to mediate protein-protein interactions with these cellular structures(1Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the SH3 domain may also serve to link proteins to ras signaling pathways(5Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y.

Cell. 1993; 73: 169-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Evidence for this association was originally pointed out in the cloning of the abl SH3-binding protein, 3BP-1(9). This polypeptide contains sequences distinct from its SH3-binding motif which are homologous to the family of GTPase activating proteins that act upon the rac/rho family of small G-proteins. Additionally, recent evidence indicates that rac and rho control membrane ruffling and stress fiber organization, respectively(10Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3840) Google Scholar, 11Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3081) Google Scholar). Thus, these data indicate a link between SH3-containing proteins, ras signaling pathways, and cytoskeletal associations. Recently, we described the predicted amino acid sequence of a novel Src-binding protein, called AFAP-110(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This novel cytoskeletal-associated protein was distinctive in that it could be independently adsorbed with bacterial encoded fusion proteins expressing either the SH2 or SH3 domains of pp60src or pp59fyn(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AFAP-110 encodes predicted SH2- and SH3-binding motifs(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These data indicate that AFAP-110 is both an SH2- and SH3-binding partner for Src and that it is capable of forming a stable interaction with more than one member of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. It was hypothesized that one possible function of AFAP-110 was to facilitate interactions between SH2/SH3-containing proteins and the cytoskeleton(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These stable complexes may be significant as the binding of AFAP-110 to activated forms of Src correlate strongly with transformation(13Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.-C.R. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Wang H.-C. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3951-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Activated variants of Src that contain deletions in the SH2 or SH3 domains are both defective for transformation and unable to form a stable complex with AFAP-110(13Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.-C.R. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Wang H.-C. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3951-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These data indicate that one criterion for transformation would require intact SH2 and SH3 domains to facilitate interactions with SH2 and SH3 cellular binding partners. Because AFAP-110 is associated with actin structures(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Kanner S.B.

Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the concomitant disruption of actin cables is a hallmark of transformation by Src(16Felice G.R. Eason P. Nermut M.V. Kellie S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 47-59PubMed Google Scholar, 17Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), then AFAP-110 could play an important role in modulating the effects of Src on the cytoskeleton. In addition, AFAP-110 may represent an important component in the pathway of signal transduction through c-Src and c-Fyn. In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a variant form of the Src SH2/SH3-binding protein AFAP-110. This larger variant, called AFAP-120, has a molecular mass of 120 kDa and encodes a novel domain containing 86 amino acids placed near the carboxyl terminus which do not disrupt the downstream reading frame homologous to AFAP-110. Northern and Western blot analysis demonstrate that this larger variant can be detected in brain. AFAP-120 retains predicted SH2- and SH3-binding motifs and can be efficiently adsorbed by GST 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseCMVcytomegalovirusCEchick embryomAbmonoclonal antibodybpbase pair(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPSmorpholinepanesulfonic acid. -SH3 created from c-Src. The novel 86-amino-acid insert encodes a unique sequence that contain a proline-rich region resembling an SH3-binding motif. Expression and immobilization of the NINS as a GST-encoded fusion protein (GST-NINS) reveals that a 67-kDa protein from brain lysates will associate with GST-NINS, but not to GST alone. This association requires the integrity of a proline-rich motif in the NINS.

A λgt11 cDNA expression library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) created from the mRNA of a 10-day-old chick embryo was screened as described previously(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A single cDNA clone, p2.1, was isolated by hybridization using an amino-terminal probe(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Phage from this positive plaque was purified by four rounds of plaque purification. The cDNA insert was isolated and subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). DNA sequence analysis was carried out using the dideoxy sequencing strategy(24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Aci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of clone p2.1 uncovered a sequencing error in the fibroblast homologue AFAP-110(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Two codons were omitted that predict an Asn-Asn after Ser358, rather than a single Ile at position 359, and an additional Lys residue is predicted after Gly555(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These amino acids are conserved in clone p2.1 and have no effect on the SH2- or SH3-binding motifs predicted for AFAP-120 or AFAP-110. The sequence for AFAP-120 as well as the corrected sequence of AFAP-110 (accession number L20303) have been communicated to GenBank. A full-length version of AFAP-120 was constructed by substituting the BglII-BglII fragment of p2.1 into the cDNA encoding AFAP-110. This clone is referred to as FLC2.1. DNA and amino acid sequence were analyzed by using the sequence analysis software DNASIS and PROSIS (Hitachi software, Brisbane, CA). The pCMV-1 vector was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. E. H. Humphries and was used to express cloned proteins in COS-1 cells via the CMV promoter(25Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1983; 3: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding AFAP-110 and the FLC2.1 were excised from pBluescript ks+ with HincII and SmaI digestion and subcloned into pCMV-1 via the unique SmaI restriction site in the multiple cloning site. Primary cultures of chick embryo fibroblast (CE) cells were prepared from day 9 embryos (Spafas, Norwich, CT) and cultured as described previously(26Flynn D.C. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 579-583PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were also maintained in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfection of pCMV-1 plasmid constructs into COS-1 cells was carried out according to the method of Chen and Okayama (27Chen C. Okayama H. Mol.

Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 579-583PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue lysates were obtained from either a day 16 chick embryo (chick brain) or a 7-week-old adult chicken. Immune complexes were isolated by adding either 1.2 μg of Ab F1 or 1 μl of mAb 4C3 ascites to 500 μg of RIPA cell lysate (1 μg/μl) containing protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 0.5% aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 h at 4°C, followed by immobilization of the immune complex with 100 μl of protein A-sepharose (Pharmacia), 50% (w/v), for 2 h at 4°C. The immobilized immune complexes were washed and resuspended in boiling Laemmli sample buffer. Western transfer and Western blot analysis with Ab F1 or mAb 4C3 were done as described previously(26Flynn D.C. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 579-583PubMed Google Scholar). Bound primary antibody was quantitated using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by detection using chemiluminescence. The novel 258-bp insert is surrounded by sequence that define Sau3AI sites. This Sau3AI fragment encodes Ser510 to Ser593 and does not include the three carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the NINS that predict Val594, Ser595, or Gln596. This sequence was subcloned into the novel BamHI site in pGEX-2T and transfected into DH5-α bacteria. This GST-encoded fusion protein (GST-NINS for NINS) was expressed as described previously (12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The preparation of bacterial lysates containing these fusion proteins, and immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose beads, were done according to the method of Smith and Johnson(29Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated with 500 μg of chick embryo day 16 brain tissue lysate for 1.5 h at 4°C. The bound proteins were washed two times with RIPA and two times with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5. Adsorbed brain tissue proteins were removed by incubating the beads in boiling 2 × Laemmli sample buffer for 2 min, centrifuging, and resolving the supernatant by 8% SDS-PAGE. The resolved brain lysate proteins were analyzed by ammoniacal silver staining according to the method of Harlow and Lane(32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Total cellular or tissue RNA was prepared by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63228) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of RNA was mixed in a 20-μl volume of 20 mM MOPS (Sigma), pH 7.0, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 50% formamide, and 2.2 M formaldehyde, were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel (SeaKem ME, FMC BioProducts), transferred to Immobilon-N membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and hybridized with a nick-translated DNA probe using [3232P]dCTP (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA). AFAP-110 cDNA clones were isolated from λgt10 and gt11 cDNA libraries generated from the mRNA of day 10 whole chick embryos and from chick embryo fibroblast (CE) cells, as described previously (12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). One of the 5′ clones isolated from the gt11 whole chick embryo library (p2.1) encoded a 2068-bp cDNA clone that contained a 258-bp novel insert (NINS) located between AFAP-110 coding sequence encoding bp 1549 and 1550(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A 247-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the NINS was isolated by Sau3AI digestion and used to probe the same gt11 library. Two additional cDNA clones, p8.1 and p6.1, were isolated that correspond to the 3′ coding and noncoding sequence common to AFAP-110 (Fig. 1A). Clone p8.1 begins at bp 1444 that is predicted for AFAP-110 and encodes sequence homologous to clone p2.1, including the NINS. The clone p8.1 terminates at bp 2252, which is 59 bp downstream of the 3′ termination codon predicted for AFAP-110. Clone p6.1 begins further upstream at bp 1327, predicted for AFAP-110, and encodes the NINS. Clone p6.1 terminates at bp 2129 within the coding region common to AFAP-110 and clone p2.1. The fact that the NINS was detected in three different cDNA clones and exists between sequence that define AFAP-110 indicate that the NINS is an authentic biological entity. The 258-bp insert encodes 86 amino acids and retains the integrity of the serine residue encoded at amino acid position 510 (Fig. 1B). In addition, the 258-bp insert does not disrupt the downstream reading frame predicted from the AFAP-110 encoded phenylalanine 511 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, a second variant cDNA has been isolated that diverges from AFAP-110 cDNA sequence at exactly the same bp (bp 1549); however, this variant encodes 19 novel amino acids after serine 510, followed by an opal stop codon and 3′-noncoding sequence. 2D. C. Flynn, unpublished data. Because two different variants of AFAP-110 have been isolated that diverge at exactly the same site, we speculate that AFAP-120 may have arisen by alternative splicing. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 258-bp insert revealed a novel sequence that was not homologous with any proteins in the GenBank data base. The 86-amino-acid sequence contains a disproportionate number of serine residues (15 serine residues, or 17% of the insert) and a short proline-rich motif (boxed). To characterize the NINS, a full-length version of this variant was created by substituting the BglII to BglII fragment of p2.1 (bp 1162-2056) into the same BglII to BglII restriction site of full-length AFAP-110 (Fig. 1A). This clone is referred to as full-length clone p2.1 (FLC2.1) and encodes 723 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 81,458 Da. The 86 amino acids have a predicted molecular mass of 9534 Da. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the protein encoded by FLC2.1 would have a molecular mass of 120 kDa. Because clone p2.1 was isolated from a λgt11 library created from the RNAs of a whole chick embryo, it was further hypothesized that a variant form of AFAP-110 of 120 kDa might be detected in a specific organ by Western blot analysis. Tissues were extracted from a 7-week-old chicken, lysed in RIPA, 25 μg of cellular proteins resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride by Western transfer. The transfer was then probed with mAb 4C3 (28Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The data reveal that all tissues contain a 110-kDa protein that is AFAP-110 (Fig. 2, lanes 1-11). Liver and kidney (lanes 7 and 8) contain very low levels of AFAP-110 that can be detected by extended exposure to film.2 However, in tissue lysates derived from brain, a 120-kDa isoform was also identified (Fig. 2, lane 2). These data indicate that a larger 120-kDa variant of AFAP-110 is represented in brain. Furthermore, the steady-state levels of expression appear to be significantly higher in brain than the other non-neural tissues. Treatment of the 120-kDa protein from brain with potato acid phosphatase indicated that the increased molecular mass could not be entirely accounted for by increased phosphorylations.2 This larger variant form of the AFAP-110 protein detected in brain lysates is referred to as AFAP-120, for Actin Filament Associated Protein-120 kDa. The effect of the novel 258-bp insert was examined with respect to changes in the molecular mass. The cDNAs encoding AFAP-110, or FLC2.1, were subcloned from pBluescript KS+ into the expression vector pCMV-1 for transient expression in COS-1 cells. These new constructs, pCMV-FLC2.1 and pCMV-AFAP-110, as well as pCMV-1, were transfected into COS-1 cells and the cells lysed with RIPA lysis buffer 60 h post-transfection. The transiently expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with mAb 4C3, which is avian specific (28Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and would preferentially recognize these avian proteins rather than the COS-1 (African green monkey) cellular form of AFAP-110 (Fig. 3, lane 5). For comparison, AFAP-120 and AFAP-110 were immunoprecipitated with mAb 4C3 from day 16 chick embryo brain and CE, (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The data demonstrate that the protein encoded by FLC2.1 has a molecular mass of 120 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 3) and is equivalent in size to AFAP-120 immunoprecipitated from chick brain (Fig. 3, lane 1). In addition, the transiently expressed AFAP-110 (Fig. 3, lane 4) has a molecular mass equivalent to the 110-kDa AFAP-110 immunoprecipitated from CE cells (Fig. 3, lane 2). These data indicate that the 86-amino-acid insert encoded in FLC2.1 is sufficient to give rise to the 120-kDa brain form of AFAP-110, referred to as AFAP-120. Interestingly, an immunoreactive polypeptide of 92 kDa is detected in pCMV-FLC2.1-transfected COS-1 cells and an 82-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide is detected in pCMV-AFAP-110-transfected COS-1 cells, (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). It is likely that these lower molecular weight forms are the products of proteolytic degradation. Similarly sized polypeptides are detected in cell and tissue lysates (see Fig. 2) and have been described earlier and postulated to be proteolytic degradation products(13Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.-C.R. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from the brain of a day 2 chick hatchling, as well as from CE cells. Twenty μg of total RNA was resolved on a formaldehyde gel, transferred to Immobilon, and probed by Northern hybridization using a probe representing the 5′ 452 base pairs common to both AFAP-110 and clone p2.1 (probe A), or a probe specific to the NINS representing the 247 base pair within the NINS that are surrounded by Sau3A1 restriction sites (probe B). The data demonstrate that probe A, common to both AFAP-110 and FLC2.1, detects an RNA of 6.2 kilobases in both brain and CE (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2), as well as a smaller RNA of 3.4 kilobases in CE cells (Fig. 4, lane 2). However, probe B only recognized a 6.2-kilobases RNA in brain (Fig. 4, lane 3) and did not hybridize to any RNA isolated from CE cells (Fig. 4, lane 4). These data indicate that the NINS is represented in brain but not in CE cells. Furthermore, the RNA detected by probes A and B are the same size in brain, suggesting that they likely hybridize to the same RNA. Taken together, these data indicate that (a) a larger 120-kDa variant of AFAP-110 can be detected in brain, (b) the novel 258-bp sequence is sufficient to increase the molecular mass of AFAP-110 to 120 kDa, and (c) the NINS can be detected in brain RNA, but not in CE cellular RNA. Thus, the FLC2.1 construct does appear to be representative of AFAP-120. The structure of the 86 amino acids encoded by the NINS predict a very hydrophilic domain,2 based on the Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy parameter set(31Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17279) Google Scholar). In addition, the NINS contains a disproportionate number of serine residues (15/86 residues or 17%). Although no sites for phosphorylation have been mapped, 7 of these serine residues are adjacent to Arg or Lys residues, which could predict a site for protein kinase C phosphorylation(33Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 17: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (807) Google Scholar). In addition, the NINS encoded within FLC2.1 does not disrupt the predicted SH2- or SH3-binding motifs(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The NINS exists in the carboxyl terminus, while the predicted SH2-binding motifs are left intact, and the predicted SH3-binding motif exists further upstream, in the amino terminus between amino acids 61-85(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For this reason, it was hypothesized that the SH3 binding properties of AFAP-120 would be unaffected. These data were confirmed by the adsorption of AFAP-120 and AFAP-110 with the c-Src SH3 domain, while neither protein was capable of interacting with c-Src+ SH3 domain.2 These data indicate that AFAP-120 could represent an important binding partner for c-Src within the brain. AFAP-120 may contain sufficient information to be an important binding partner for other cellular proteins, as well. Interestingly, it was noted that a proline-rich region which resembles an SH3-binding motif is encoded in the NINS between amino acids 541 and 551(23Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). This proline-rich motif exists in a region of the NINS that has a high hydrophilicity prediction.2 It has already been established that AFAP-110 has two potential SH3-binding motifs in the amino terminus and that AFAP-110 is an SH3-binding partner for Src and Fyn(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because it has been hypothesized that the function of AFAP-110 is to facilitate interactions between actin filaments and SH2- and/or SH3-signaling proteins, it was predicted that the NINS might facilitate interactions with additional cellular proteins. To test this hypothesis, the NINS was subcloned into pGEX-2T by isolating a 247-bp fragment that defines the 5′ and 3′ borders of the insert and subcloning it into the novel BamH I site of pGEX-2T. GST-NINS and GST were used to adsorb potential binding proteins from day 16 chick embryo brain lysates, and the molecular mass of these proteins evaluated by silver stain. To evaluate specificity in binding, three deletions were constructed in NINS (Fig. 5A). A StuI-SmaI deletion eliminates amino acids 536-593 predicted within the NINS. This binding protein is referred to as GST-NINS1-25 and encodes the first 25 amino acids of the NINS (Ser510 to Leu536). In addition, the sequences encoding Leu536 to Ser593, or Asp553 to Ser593, were subcloned into pGEX-2T and pGEX-1, respectively. These GST fusion proteins, GST-NINS26-83 and GST-NINS43-83, encode the carboxyl-terminal 55 or 41 amino acids of the NINS, respectively. These data reveal that a 67-kDa protein is adsorbed by GST-NINS (Fig. 5B, lane 1) and GST-NINS26-83 (Fig. 5B, lane 4), but not with GST or GST-NINS43-83 (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 5, respectively). These data indicate that the amino acid sequence between Tyr537 and Asp553, which encodes the proline-rich motif, is critical for binding p67. There appears to be a small amount of a 67-kDa protein absorbed by GST-NINS1-25 (Fig. 5B, lane 4), indicating that sequence interactions defined between Ser510 and Leu536 may also contribute to binding. GST-NINS and GST-NINS43-83 were used to probe other avian tissue lysates to determine whether there might be specificity in the interaction between p67 and the NINS.2 The data indicate that an equivalent amount of p67 can be adsorbed from brain, lung, muscle, liver, and kidney. Theses data support a hypothesis that p67 may not be a specific binding partner for the NINS. However, the data would indicate that the proline-rich region contained within the NINS may be responsible for facilitating protein-protein interactions in the brain. It is likely that p67 contains a structure that is favorable for interacting with the NINS proline-rich motif. Taken together, these data indicate that the function of the NINS might be to facilitate protein-protein interactions in brain via an internal proline-rich motif. Ren et al.(23Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) predicted that a consensus SH3-binding motif would be approximately 10 amino acids long and contain proline residues at peptide positions 2, 7, and 10 that would be critical for binding. In addition, a proline residue at position 9 is frequently identified as a component of an SH3-binding motif, and an alanine residue at position 1 appears to be important for binding. Lastly, a hydrophobic amino acid at peptide position 8 may contribute to stability in SH3 binding. The NINS contains a region of 11 amino acids that are almost identical to the consensus SH3-binding motif predicted by Ren et al.(23Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). This sequence contains proline residues at peptide positions −1, 2, 9, and 10, as well as a hydrophobic tyrosine residue at position 8 and serine at position 1 (a conserved change). However, this stretch of amino acids contains an arginine residue rather than a proline at peptide position 7. A proline residue at peptide position 7 was identified as being very important for stable SH3 binding(23Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). This variation could be required for some specific interaction with another cellular protein. Because the proline-rich region in the NINS resembles an SH3-binding motif, it is possible this structure could facilitate additional protein-protein interactions. It is also possible that the function of the NINS is not related to facilitating protein-protein binding. However, given that the hypothesized function of AFAP-110 is as an adaptor molecule that facilitates interactions between SH2- and/or SH3-containing proteins with the cytoskeleton(12Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it would not be unrealilistic to hypothesize that the NINS may contribute a similar function to AFAP-120, thus enhancing its diverse interactions between cellular proteins and the cytoskeleton. The function of c-Src has not been discerned; however, it is likely that this proto-oncogene has a specialized function within the brain. This hypothesis is based on several observations which indicate that (a) the c-Src tyrosine kinase is activated in brain(34Cotton P.C. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 35Levy B.T. Sorge L.K. Meymandi A. Maness P.F. Dev. Biol. 1984; 104: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 36Shores C.G.

Casalbore P. Agostini E. Tato F. Nature. 1985; 316: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, signaling by c-Src in the brain may be specific and significant. SH2/SH3 interactions between AFAP-110 or AFAP-120 and c-Src may represent an important link in signal transduction by Src. It is possible that pp60c-src may have a unique function in affecting the integrity of the cytoskeleton(15Schaller M.D. Bouton A.B. Flynn D.C. Parsons J.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Felice G.R. Eason P. Nermut M.V. Kellie S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 47-59PubMed Google Scholar, 17Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J.

Science. 1988; 239: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Localization studies in neurons indicate that pp60c-src is enriched in growth cones, a structure that is also rich in actin filaments(49Maness P.F. Aubry M. Shores C.G. Frame L. Pfenninger K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5001-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 50Sobue K. Kanda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further, pp60c-src isolated from these growth cones have a high tyrosine-specific kinase activity(49Maness P.F. Aubry M. Shores C.G. Frame L. Pfenninger K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5001-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, pp60c-src may have a specialized function in growth cone extension, which would not be inconsistent with previous observations that demonstrate a role for activated forms of Src in modulating cell-cell contacts or cell-substratum contacts. One potential function for AFAP-120 would be to facilitate interactions between SH2/SH3-containing proteins and the cytoskeleton. AFAP-120 does retain an association with actin structures, as detected by immunofluorescence with Ab F1 in COS-1 cells expressing FLC2.1.2 The function of AFAP-120 in signal transduction is not clear; however, given that nonreceptor tyrosine kinases like pp60c-src and pp59c-fyn are expressed at relatively high levels in brain(18Cooper J.A. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 85-113Google Scholar), it would appear likely that AFAP-120 would be positioned to interact with, and possibly mediate a signal transduction event through, these tyrosine kinases. Lastly, the NINS may play a unique role in facilitating a similar interaction with other cellular proteins. These stable complexes may play a functionally important role in modulating the integrity of actin filaments in response to specific cell signaling events in the brain.

Phospholipases play a key role in diverse cellular processes such as secretion by catalyzing the hydrolysis of sn-1 and sn-2 fatty acid acyl bonds of phospholipids to liberate free fatty acids and lysophospholipids (Dennis et al., 1991). Despite the fact that phospholipase activities reside on GM derived from neuronal, endocrine, and exocrine cells (Moskowitz et al., 1982; Husebye and Flatmark, 1987; Rubin et al., 1990, 1991; Hildebrandt and Albanesi, 1991; Mizuno et al., 1991), this activity has not been attributed to a specific granule membrane protein.

Examination of SDS-PAGE protein profiles of ZGM from Sprague-Dawley rats from several laboratories has revealed the presence of five major protein bands that are detectable with Coomassie dye (MacDonald and Ronzio, 1972; Ronzio et al., 1978; Paquet et al., 1982; LeBel and Beattie, 1984). Two of the major proteins are glycoproteins with molecular masses (depending upon the gel separation system) between 74 and 92 kDa (GP2) and between 54 and 58 kDa (GP3). The three other major proteins have molecular masses of approximately 70, 50, and 30 kDa. Although the functions of these ZGM proteins are unknown, GP2 and GP3 are related to proteins that exhibit lipase activities. We have recently shown that GP2 shares immunological and sequence similarity with PLA2, which suggests its possible involvement in phospholipid hydrolysis and/or binding (Withiam-Leitch et al., 1993). GP3 has recently been cloned, and its deduced sequence is highly homologous to triacylglycerol lipases (Wishart et al., 1993). zymogen granule membrane(s) zymogen granule polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing carboxyl ester hydrolase membranous carboxyl ester hydrolase phospholipase C phospholipase A secretory PLA polyvinylidene difluoride 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid free arachidonic acid phosphatidylcholine bovine serum albumin Tris-buffered saline secretory CEH diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Carboxyl ester hydrolase (CEH) is a 70-kDa secretory enzyme of exocrine pancreas that catalyzes the digestion of dietary fats in the intestine (Wang and Hartsuck, 1993). Although CEH has a recognized role in the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters and neutral lipids (Rudd and Brockman, 1984), it is also capable of hydrolyzing lysophospholipids and phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Lombardo et al., 1980; Rudd and Brockman, 1984; Wang and Hartsuck, 1993). In this report, we demonstrate that ZGM exhibits two Ca2+-independent phospholipase activities of the PLA1 and lysophospholipase types. Both of these activities were found to be specifically associated with the major protein band of 70 kDa. Based upon enzymatic, immunological, and N-terminal sequence data, as well as two-dimensional gel analysis, we conclude that this protein is a membrane-associated form of carboxyl ester hydrolase. Antiserum to porcine secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Purified porcine sPLA2 was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. GP2 antiserum was a kind gift of Dr. Adrien Beaudoin of the University of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. Antiserum to carboxyl ester hydrolase was kindly provided by Dr. Howard Brockman of the Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota. All electrophoretic reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Zymogen granules (ZG) were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (Rubin et al., 1990). ZG were lysed for 15 min in 25 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) at 4°C. ZGM were isolated from the ZG lysate by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 5 mM MOPS (pH 7.0) and is referred to as ZGM pH 8.2, or unwashed ZGM. ZGM pH 8.2 were processed further in lysis buffer that contained various concentrations of NaCl. For most experiments, the entire yield of ZGM pH 8.2 was washed once in 25 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.6 M NaCl. For experiments designed to determine the affinity of proteins to ZGM, a 20-μl aliquot of unwashed ZGM was placed in 2 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.0-2.0 M NaCl. ZGM were washed for 30 min at 4°C with mixing, and the ZGM then collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellets were brought up in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer in preparation for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Amylase activity (zymogen granule marker) was assayed as described by Bernfeld(1955). Lactate dehydrogenase (cytosolic marker) and fumarase (mitochondrial marker) activities were assayed as described previously by Whittaker and Barker(1972). Acid phosphatase (lysosomal marker) and alkaline phosphatase (plasma membrane marker) were assayed using Sigma Diagnostic kits as per the manufacturer's specifications. Rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase (endoplasmic reticulum marker) was assayed as described by Sottocasa et al.(1967). All marker enzyme activities were readily detected in the homogenate. Amylase, a marker enzyme for ZG, was enriched 6.6-fold compared to the homogenate. Enzyme markers for plasma membrane (alkaline phosphatase) and cytosol (lactate dehydrogenase) were not detectable in the ZG fraction. The relative specific activity of amylase in the ZG fraction was enriched 738-fold relative to NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity (endoplasmic reticulum marker), 300-fold compared to fumarase activity (mitochondrial marker), and 33-fold compared to acid phosphatase activity (lysosomal marker). Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli(1970) using a Bio-Rad Minigel system. After transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose or PVDF, the membrane was blocked by a 2-h exposure to 5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.4). The blots were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the primary antibody diluted in 5% BSA/TBS. Antisera dilutions were as follows: anti-CEH, 1:5000; anti-GP2, 1:10,000; and anti-PLA2, 1:1000. After being washed in TBS, 0.5% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with 167 nCi/ml 125I-labeled anti-rabbit IgG in 5% BSA/TBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by four 20-min washes. The blots were exposed for 2-72 h to Kodak XAR film for autoradiography. Proteins were eluted from SDS-PAGE gels and renatured using modifications of the procedures developed by Hager and Burgess (1980) and Pind and Kuksis(1987). ZGM protein samples (400 μg) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer devoid of reducing agents. The samples were not boiled. Following SDS-PAGE, one lane of the resolved proteins stained with Coomassie Blue was used as a reference for identifying proteins. The gel fraction of interest was then cut away from the rest of the gel and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer containing 5 ml of elution buffer consisting of 0.1% SDS, 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 150 mM NaCl. The gel homogenate was rotated overnight at room temperature and then centrifuged at 4000 × g to pellet the gel fragments. The supernatant containing the eluted proteins was precipitated using 25 ml of ice-cold acetone, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The protein precipitate was then solubilized in 40 μl of 6 M guanidine-HCl in 5 mM MOPS (pH 7.0). After incubating the mixture for 20 min at room temperature, 2 ml of renaturation buffer consisting of 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 20% glycerol, 0.5% CHAPS, and 1 mM EGTA was added. The renatured proteins were then used for phospholipase assays and/or solubilized in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Phospholipase activity was assayed using a sonicated dispersion of 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine (PC). The reaction mixture contained: 10 μg of ZGM protein, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), and 20 μM of the substrate (55 μCi/ml) in 100 μl of assay buffer. Unless otherwise noted, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37°C and was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) containing 0.06 N HCl. After extraction (Bligh and Dyer, 1959), the lipids were separated by thin layer chromatagraphy using chloroform/methanol/water (92:49:8) as a solvent to separate phospholipids, or petroleum ether/absolute ether/acetic acid (50:50:1) to separate neutral lipids. Radioactive spots were then scraped from the TLC plates and quantified by scintillation spectrometry. The following buffers were used in the standard assay to determine the pH dependence of ZGM phospholipase activity: 50 mM sodium acetate-acetic acid (pH 3.5-5.5), MES (pH 6.5), MOPS (pH 7.0), and Tris-HCl (pH 7.5-10.0). Ca2+ dependence was determined by adjusting the free Ca2+ concentration in the standard assay between 0 and 5 mM by the use of Ca2+-EGTA buffers as described by Fabiato(1988). For experiments to determine the relative contribution of the PLA1 and PLA2 pathways, the following substrates were used: 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (1∗2∗PC, where asterisk indicates point of 14C labeling) (112 μCi/μmol) and 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (1,2∗PC) (55 μCi/μmol). The generation of labeled lysoPC from 1∗2∗PC could be due either to PLA1 (i.e. 2∗lysoPC) or PLA2 (i.e. 1∗lysoPC). The generation of labeled lysoPC from 1,2∗PC can only result from PLA1 activity (i.e. 2∗PC). Subtracting the amount of lysoPC derived from 1,2∗PC (PLA1) from the lysoPC produced from 1∗2∗PC (PLA1+ PLA2) yields the amount of lysoPC produced by PLA2 activity. Experiments to detect lysophospholipase activity were performed using 1-[1-14C]-stearoyl lysoPC (56 μCi/μmol) in the standard assay. Phospholipase assays were performed on samples renatured from SDS-PAGE by adding 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl PC in 5 mM MOPS (pH 7.0) to 0.75-1.0 ml of protein solution to give a final PC concentration of 20 μM. The assays were carried out for 3 h at 37°C. The extended incubation time was necessitated by the fact that CHAPS, which was required in the renaturation buffer to recover measurable enzyme activity, reduced specific phospholipase activity by 80-90%. Recovery of ZGM phospholipase activity after elution from gels ranged from 19-28% (23.2 ± 2.6%, n = 3). Membranous GP2 was solubilized by incubating 400 μg of ZGM for 2 h at 37°C with 0.3 units of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC (Bacillus thuringiensis) contained in 300 μl of 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0). This mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain soluble and particulate fractions. This procedure results in the translocation of more than 80% of ZGM-associated GP2 to the soluble phase (Withiam-Leitch et al., 1993). ZGM proteins washed with 0.6 M NaCl were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by Western blotting to PVDF membranes. Approximately 100 pmol of 70-kDa membrane protein was subjected to automated Edman degradation using a Porton sequencer (Beckman) equipped with an on-line detection unit to identify phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid derivatives. The analysis was provided by the Protein Sequencing Facility of the State University of New York, Buffalo, NY. Salt-washed (0.6 M NaCl) zymogen granules (400 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The 70-kDa protein was excised, electroeluted from the gel, and precipitated with 9 volumes of ice-cold methanol. After centrifugation, the protein pellet was solubilized for isoelectric focusing (IEF) as described by O'Farrell(1975) and adapted for the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II gel system. Protein samples prepared in an equivalent manner for IEF/SDS-PAGE were visualized either by silver staining (Bio-Rad) or by Western blot analysis with CEH-specific antiserum as described above. ZGM isolated by pH 8.2 lysis contained a substantial amount of the digestive enzymes amylase and secretory PLA2 (sPLA2). The relative specific activity of amylase was elevated 1.25-fold (± 0.71) on unwashed ZGM relative to the homogenate, indicating substantial amylase contamination of these membranes. Washing these membranes in 0.6 M NaCl reduced the relative specific activity of amylase on ZGM to 0.004 (± 0.002) relative to the homogenate, indicating that a single high salt wash is capable of removing 99.6% of the amylase from ZGM pH 8.2. Similarly, immunoblot analysis of ZGM pH 8.2 revealed significant contamination of sPLA2; however, a single 0.6 M NaCl wash rendered sPLA2 undetectable by Western blotting (data not shown). In addition, Coomassie Blue stains comparing the protein composition of ZGM pH 8.2 and 0.6 M NaCl-washed ZGM revealed that many other secretory proteins were also removed from pH 8.2 membranes by a single high salt wash (Fig. 1). Preparation of ZGM in this manner consistently produced protein patterns consisting of five major protein bands that were readily identified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain after separation by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1). Molecular weight estimates of these five protein bands differed slightly depending on whether the acrylamide concentration used in the gel was 7.5 or 10%. In experiments conducted using 10% acrylamide gels, the estimates (n = 3) of molecular weight obtained by regression analysis were: 91.7 ± 4.3, 69.8 ± 2.6, 58.3 ± 3.1, 50.2 ± 0.6, and 30.3 ± 0.9 kDa. For convenience, these proteins will be referred to as 92, 70, 58, 50, and 30 kDa. The 92-kDa protein has been identified by Western blotting as GP2 (Withiam-Leitch et al., 1993; also see below). The observation that washing of ZGM with 0.6 M NaCl removed sPLA2, amylase, and other secretory proteins from ZGM pH 8.2 is important for two reasons. First, washing with high salt produced a protein profile consistent with previous studies (MacDonald and Ronzio, 1972; Ronzio et al., 1978; Paquet et al., 1982; LeBel and Beattie, 1984). Second, our ZGM preparation is of sufficient purity to study ZGM phospholipase activity specifically associated with the membranes. ZGM-mediated breakdown of PC, the major phospholipid component of ZGM, in the pH range of 3.5-10.0 and in the Ca2+ concentration range of 0-5 mM resulted in the production of two reaction products (Fig. 2). The sole neutral lipid product of PC hydrolysis was labeled free arachidonic acid (AA∗), whereas the sole phospholipid product of PC breakdown was lysophospholipid. ZGM-mediated phospholipase activity showed a sharp pH profile, with a pH optimum of 7.0 (Fig. 3) and no requirement for Ca2+ over the concentration range of 0-1 mM (data not shown). In fact, the presence of Ca2+ slightly inhibited (~20-25%) phospholipase activity at concentrations ranging from 1 μM-1 mM. The generation of lysoPC from the PC substrate (labeled on the fatty acid in the sn-2 position) must be a consequence of a PLA1-type activity. The labeled arachidonic acid identified was not generated by phospholipase C ((PLC)/diacylglycerol lipase activity) or phospholipase D (phospholipase D/phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activity) because of the absence of labeled diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid, respectively (Fig. 2). To evaluate the roles of PLA2 or PLA1/lysophospholipase in the liberation of free arachidonate, three sets of experiments were performed. First, direct measurements of phospholipase activity associated with salt-washed ZGM via differentially labeled PC substrates (see “Experimental Procedures”) demonstrated that greater than 90% of the initial breakdown of PC is via a PLA1 mechanism, with only a minor contribution from a PLA2 pathway (Table 1). In addition, an analysis of the time course of ZGM phospholipase activity (Fig. 4) revealed that the initial rate (5-20 min) of 2∗lysoPC accumulation (0.98 nmol × min-1× mg-1) was higher than the initial rate of AA∗ release (0.30 nmol × min-1× mg-1). At later time points (30-45 min), the rate of AA∗ production increased (1.10 nmol × min-1× mg-1), after which the rate of lysoPC accumulation reached a plateau. This finding is consistent with free AA∗ being formed from PC indirectly by a PLA1/lysophospholipase pathway. That is, the rate of free AA∗ formed by lysophospholipase activity is increased as the pool of 2∗lysoPC is augmented by PLA1 activity. Labeled lysoPC levels reached a steady state due to an equilibrium between its production from PC breakdown and its degradation due to lysophospholipase activity. Finally, the additional finding that salt-washed ZGM were also capable of hydrolyzing labeled lysoPC with an initial rate (0.83 nmol × min-1× mg-1) comparable to the rate of appearance of AA∗ generated from PC after 30-45 min (Fig. 4) substantiated the presence of a lysophospholipase. These collective findings demonstrate that the major phospholipase activities of ZGM involve Ca2+-independent PLA1 and lysophospholipase activities, with only a minor contribution from a PLA2 pathway.Table I Open table in a new tab Rat exocrine pancreas expresses CEH, which has both lysophospholipase and PLA1 activities that are known to be calcium-independent. Therefore, we next tested whether a CEH-specific polyclonal antiserum cross-reacts with any of the proteins of the ZGM. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, the antiserum recognizes a protein of 70 kDa on these membranes. To examine the potential of the soluble form of CEH to adsorb nonspecifically to ZGM during isolation, ZGM were washed with increasing concentrations of NaCl to determine the strength and specificity of CEH binding to ZGM. Washing with NaCl concentrations up to 0.45 M removed a significant proportion (65-70%) of the CEH (Fig. 5C). These results are consistent with the data presented in Fig. 1 regarding the removal of the secretory content from ZGM. There was, however, a significant amount of CEH that remained associated with ZGM (30% of the starting material associated with lysed membranes) even when the salt concentration was increased to 1.0 M NaCl (Fig. 5C). By contrast, there was no change in GP2 associated with ZGM at any of the salt concentrations (Fig. 5C). The inability of high salt to remove additional CEH was not due to insufficient washing, as repeated washings in 0.6 M NaCl did not produce an additional decrease in the amount of CEH associated with ZGM (Fig. 5A, lanes 9 and 10). Increasing the NaCl concentration to 2.0 M produced an additional decrease in the amount of CEH remaining on ZGM (<5%; Fig. 5A, lane8). Immunoblots of these same fractions with GP2 antiserum (GP2 is an integral membrane protein) show that the recovery of ZGM in each of these fractions was essentially equal (Fig. 5B). Thus, the changes in CEH associated with ZGM observed after high salt washes were not due to variability in the recovery of ZGM during the experimental procedures. These data indicate that the CEH which associates with ZGM isolated without salt washing has two components. One can be removed by low concentrations of salt (0.15-0.45 M NaCl) and probably represents nonspecific adsorption of secretory CEH (sCEH). A significant proportion of the total CEH, however, remains tightly associated with the ZGM in salt-concentrations up to 1.0 M. This latter form of the enzyme, which will heretofore be referred to as mCEH, is probably a peripheral membrane protein. The molecular mass of ZGM-associated CEH (mCEH), as determined by immunoblotting, coincides precisely with one of the five major ZGM proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa (cf.Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:A). To determine further whether the 70-kDa protein of ZGM is composed of mCEH, ZGM proteins were blotted onto PVDF membrane, and the 70-kDa band cut out and subjected to amino acid sequencing. The N-terminal sequence of mCEH was determined to be A-K-L-G-A-V-Y-T-E-G, which exhibits 100% identity to the N-terminal sequence of the secretory form of CEH (Kissel et al., 1989). To assess whether other proteins are present within the 70-kDa protein band resolved on one-dimensional gels, the 70-kDa band derived from 0.6 M NaCl-washed ZGM was also analyzed by two-dimensional IEF × SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). Silver stain revealed a string of three densely stained protein spots and an additional minor species at the acidic end of the string. The molecular mass of all four spots was equal to 70 kDa (Fig. 6A). A similar two-dimensional gel was processed for Western blotting using the anti-CEH specific polyclonal antiserum. In this case, a series of five immunoreactive spots was detected at molecular mass = 70 kDa (Fig. 6B). A sixth spot exhibited slightly lower electrophoretic mobility (72 kDa). Four of these spots overlapped precisely with the silver-stained protein spots. These results indicate that the 70-kDa protein band of salt-washed ZGM is composed entirely of several different isoforms of mCEH. The inability of the silver-stain method to detect an equivalent number of spots by immunoreactivity is likely to be due to the greater sensitivity of the antiserum and possibly to the differential sensitivity of the stain to variations in the carbohydrate content of the isoforms (see Deh et al., 1985). The first approach to determining which ZGM proteins were associated with phospholipase activity involved an assessment of the locus of enzyme activity in a non-reducing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was divided into five equal slices of RF = 0.0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, and so on (Fig. 7A). Proteins in these slices were eluted and prepared for phospholipase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Virtually all of the ZGM phospholipase activity was localized with ZGM proteins having a relative mobility of RF = 0.2-0.4 (mass = ~60-100 kDa; Table 2). Both 2∗lysoPC and AA∗ were produced by the enzyme(s) in this fraction, which is consistent with the products formed from PC in native ZGM. Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 7A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 7B) showed that mCEH and GP2 were the only major proteins in this gel slice, and that the non-reducing conditions employed produced an overlapping distribution of these two proteins. The phospholipase activity of ZGM, therefore, was due to either mCEH or GP2.Table II Open table in a new tab To determine the relative contribution of mCEH and GP2 to the phospholipase activity, the region of the gel that harbored mCEH and GP2 was cut into eight slices (RF = 0.2-0.4, Fig. 7). Virtually all of the 2∗lysoPC and AA∗ breakdown products was localized to gel slice 5 (Fig. 7). Western blot analysis showed that mCEH was found only in gel slice 5 (Fig. 7). The greatest amount of GP2 was also present in gel slice 5, although there were significant amounts of GP2 in gel slices 1-4 and 6, which possessed minimal phospholipase activity. To assess further the relative contributions of mCEH and GP2 to ZGM phospholipase activity, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor property of GP2 (LeBel and Beattie, 1988) was used to selectively remove GP2 from ZGM. Following treatment of ZGM with phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC, over 80% of GP2 was found in the soluble phase, whereas CEH was not detectable in the soluble phase (data not shown). The premise of this experiment was that phospholipase activity due to GP2 would be removed from ZGM by PLC treatment, whereas the distribution of mCEH phospholipase activity would be unaffected. Over 95% of the 2∗lysoPC produced (which is due to PLA1) in control membranes was retained after PLC treatment (Table 3). Since the GP2/mCEH region of the gel contained all of the enzyme activity (cf. Fig. 7A), this finding clearly demonstrates that mCEH is a ZGM protein with PLA1-type activity.Table III Open table in a new tab The possible involvement of GP2 in the deacylation of PC was, nevertheless, suggested by a 37% reduction in the amount of radiolabeled AA∗ produced by ZGM pretreated with phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC (Table 3). The possibility that GP2 may be directly releasing AA∗ from 1,2∗PC by PLA2 activity seems unlikely since no rise in AA∗ production was observed in the PLC supernatant, which contains most of the GP2 originally found on the ZGM. Alternatively, the supposition that GP2 functions as a lysophospholipase would explain the lack of AA∗ accumulation in the PLC supernatant. The absence of mCEH in this fraction implies that no 2∗lysoPC would be enzymatically produced to serve as a substrate for GP2. However, when the redistribution experiments were performed using labeled lysoPC rather than PC as a substrate, a translocation of lysophospholipase activity from ZGM to the soluble phase could not be demonstrated (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that mCEH is responsible for the PLA1 activity and at least 60-65% of the lysophospholipase activity. Although there is no compelling explanation for the loss of some phospholipase activity on PLC-treated ZGM, it may be that detachment of GP2 from ZGM results in a loss of its enzymatic activity. The secretory form of CEH binds specifically and saturably to heparin localized to epithelial cell membranes in the small intestine (Bosner et al., 1988, 1989). To investigate whether a similar mode of binding might account for the attachment of mCEH, ZGMs were washed with various concentrations of heparin sulfate. Indeed, heparin differentially displaced CEH, without affecting GP2 membrane association (Fig. 8A). The relative specificity of the displacement by heparin was revealed by the finding that equivalent concentrations of chondroitin sulfate, another glycosaminoglycan, did not dissociate mCEH as effectively as heparin (Fig. 8B). In addition, ovalbumin and soybean trypsin inhibitor, which might compete for putative nonspecific protein binding sites, were ineffective in displacing mCEH (Fig. 8A). Previous studies have shown that the soluble form of CEH is completely inhibited by the serine-reactive compound diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)(Van Den Bosch et al., 1973; Mizuno and Brockman, 1990). To examine whether the phospholipase activity associated with ZGM has a serine-reactive site like that of soluble CEH, ZGM were washed with 0.6 M NaCl and then pretreated with 1 mM DFP for 20 min prior to the phospholipase assay. PC breakdown was inhibited 97.1 ± 3.2% (n = 3) in DFP-treated ZGM compared to control ZGM. This result provides additional evidence that mCEH is responsible for measurable phospholipase activity. This study has identified a 70-kDa membrane-associated carboxyl ester hydrolase (mCEH) as one of the five major ZGM proteins. This identification is based upon: (a) immunological cross-reactivity with a specific, high affinity polyclonal antiserum against rat CEH; (b) 100% sequence identity of the N terminus of the 70-kDa protein with the known sequence of CEH; (c) two-dimensional gel analysis; and (d) direct measurement of a characteristic enzymatic profile from the 70-kDa protein isolated from non-reducing gels. The ZGM-associated mCEH shares similar physicochemical properties with the secretory form of CEH (sCEH), as evidenced by their similar mobility on SDS-PAGE, and the complete conservation of the N-terminal sequence. The mCEH and sCEH also have similar enzymatic properties since both enzymes are Ca2+-independent phospholipase/lysophospholipases, possess a pH optimum of approximately 7.0, and are inhibited by the serine-reactive compound DFP (Murthy and Ganguly, 1962; Hyun et al., 1969; Mizuno and Brockman, 1990; Wang and Hartsuck, 1993). On the other hand, mCEH can be distinguished from sCEH based on its association with ZGM even in the presence of high concentrations of salt. These findings suggest that mCEH is a ZGM-associated form of secretory CEH. Retention of mCEH on ZGM, even at salt concentrations as high as 1 M, is incompatible with binding via weak electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, Scheele et al.(1978) found that basic secretory proteins of exocrine pancreas are nonspecifically adsorbed in larger quantities and with higher affinity to membranes as compared to acidic proteins. Under high salt conditions, therefore, pancreatic CEH, which is an acidic protein (Erlanson, 1975; Ghosh and Grogan, 1991), would be expected to be removed from ZGM more readily than the basic protein amylase (pI = 8.4; Scheele, 1981). Our findings, however, demonstrate that although amylase, sPLA2, and other secretory proteins can be removed by a single wash with 0.6 M NaCl, 30-40% of ZGM pH 8.2-associated CEH was retained even after several washes with 0.6 M NaCl. This salt-stable association indicates that the relationship of the enzyme to the membrane is based upon a more specific interaction than simple adsorption. Increasing the salt concentration to 2 M removes nearly all of the CEH from the membrane, suggesting further that mCEH is a peripheral rather than an integral membrane protein. Our results using two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE demonstrate that multiple isoelectric variants of mCEH can be resolved. Further studies are needed to determine whether the representation of these isoforms in the granule contents is, in any way, different from that found on the ZGM. Although mCEH of ZGM and sCEH may be composed of different post-translational variants, we cannot presently exclude the additional possibility that a limited number of high affinity binding sites is responsible for a specific interaction of sCEH with ZGM. A heparin-sensitive attachment site may mediate the binding of mCEH to ZGM. This supposition derives from our finding that heparin was capable of dissociating mCEH from ZGM. The possibility that a heparin-like moiety provides a specific binding site for mCEH gains support from the fact that ZGM contain heparin proteoglycans and other sulfated compounds (Kronquist et al., 1977; Reggio and Palade, 1978). The fact that a relatively high concentration of heparin was required for displacement of mCEH from ZGM implies that the putative heparin-binding sites may exhibit high affinity and low turnover. A charge effect to account for the displacement of CEH by heparin appears unlikely since a comparable concentration of chondroitin sulfate, which is more highly charged than heparin, was much less effective in displacing mCEH. Our analysis of ZGM phospholipase activity showed that over 90% of PC breakdown involved a Ca2+-independent PLA1/lysophospholipase pathway. These phospholipase activities were all recovered from a 2-mm section of gel, which contained mCEH and no other detectable protein, as determined by immunoblotting and silver stain of salt-washed ZGM analyzed by two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE. Thus, the 70-kDa protein, which is one of the five major proteins of purified ZGM, is composed of CEH exhibiting measurable phospholipase activity. Our previous study demonstrated the sequence similarity and immunological relatedness of GP2 to secretory PLA2 (Withiam-Leitch et al., 1993). This led us to hypothesize that GP2 may be involved in phospholipid binding and/or hydrolysis. Although phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC treatment of ZGM slightly decreased phospholipase activity (cf. Table 3), direct measurement of GP2-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis could not be demonstrated. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that different pH, phospholipid substrate, or detergent conditions than those utilized for characterizing mCEH are required to detect the phospholipid hydrolyzing activity of GP2. Although phospholipase activities have been described on secretory granule membranes of other secretory cells, most studies attribute the release of sn-2 fatty acids from phospholipids to PLA2 activity (Moskowitz et al., 1982; Hildebrandt and Albanesi, 1991; Mizuno et al., 1991). However, as considered in this and other studies (Waite, 1985; Dennis et al., 1991), sn-2 fatty acids can be released by PLA1, PLA2-, PLC-, and PLD-mediated pathways. Granule membranes of parotid acinar cells appear to contain primarily a Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity, but at least 20% of PC breakdown is probably mediated via a PLA1 pathway (Mizuno et al., 1991). Adrenal chromaffin granule membranes contain Ca2+-independent PLA2, PLA1, and lysophospholipase activities (Husebye and Flatmark, 1987; Hildebrandt and Albanesi, 1991). The existence of multiple Ca2+-independent phospholipase activities in other granule membranes coincides with the enzymatic properties of mCEH. Studies to clarify both the enzymatic activity and the molecular species responsible in each of these preparations would be extremely useful in exploring the general applicability of the present findings. In conclusion, our demonstration that the 70-kDa mCEH from ZGM exhibits enzymatic activity represents the first identification of a protein responsible for granule membrane phospholipase activity. The finding that ZGM mCEH catalyzes the release of unsaturated fatty acids and lysophospholipids from PC has important implications with regard to membrane fusion. Unsaturated fatty acids have been repeatedly implicated in the exocytotic process because of their potential to promote membrane fusion (Creutz, 1981; Burgoyne, 1991). LysoPC induces membrane destabilization, and could therefore also promote membrane fusion (Poole et al., 1970). The identification of mCEH as a phospholipase on ZGM should fuel further studies on the role of this enzyme in the secretory cycle.

It is a single polypeptide of Mr 16,000 with a Km for Ap4A of 1.9 μM and kcat = 3.6 s−1. It is inhibited competitively by adenosine 5′-tetraphosphate (Ki = 7.5 nM) and non-competitively by fluoride ions (Ki = 50 μM). The specific activity of the enzyme in crude extracts of at least 20 milliunits/mg protein is 10-100 times higher than in any other eukaryote so far examined. Interestingly, firefly luciferase is known to synthesize Ap4A and related adenine-containing dinucleoside tetraphosphates in vitro. The high activity of Ap4A hydrolase in lanterns may be related to this ability and could be relevant to the use of the luciferase gene as a reporter gene.

https://openalex.org/W2021463808,"The phosphofructokinases (PFKs) from the bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus differ markedly in their regulation by ATP. Whereas E. coli PFK (EcPFK) is profoundly inhibited by ATP, B. stearothermophilus PFK (BsPFK) is only slightly inhibited. The structural basis for this difference could be closure of the active site via a conformational transition that occurs in the ATP-binding domain of EcPFK, but is absent in BsPFK. To investigate the role of this transition in ATP inhibition of EcPFK, we have constructed a chimeric enzyme that contains the “rigid” ATP-binding domain of BsPFK grafted onto the remainder of the EcPFK subunit. The chimeric PFK has the following characteristics: (i) tetrameric structure and kinetic parameters similar to those of the native enzymes, (ii) insensitivity to regulation by the effector phosphoenolpyruvate despite its ability to bind to the enzyme, and (iii) a sigmoidal (nH around 2) fructose 6-phosphate saturation curve. From the results, it is concluded that the active site regions of the two native enzymes are remarkably similar, but their effector sites and their mechanisms of heterotropic regulation are different. The chimeric subunit is locked in a structure resembling that of activated E. coli PFK, yet the enzyme can exist in two different conformational states. Mechanisms for its sigmoidal kinetics are discussed. The phosphofructokinases (PFKs) from the bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus differ markedly in their regulation by ATP.
