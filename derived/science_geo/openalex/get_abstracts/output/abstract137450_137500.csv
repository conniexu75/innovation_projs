After undifferentiated proliferation in vitro for 4 to 5 months, these cells still maintained the developmental potential to form trophoblast and derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers, including gut epithelium (endoderm); cartilage, bone, smooth muscle, and striated muscle (mesoderm); and neural epithelium, embryonic ganglia, and stratified squamous epithelium (ectoderm). These cell lines should be useful in human developmental biology, drug discovery, and transplantation medicine."

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images demonstrate that the wall thickness of the hollow spheres can be readily controlled by varying the number of nanoparticle-polymer deposition cycles, and the size and shape are determined by the morphology of the templating colloid. The hollow spheres produced are envisioned to have applications in areas ranging from medicine to pharmaceutics to materials science."

Here, carbon nanotubes aligned over areas up to several square centimeters were grown on nickel-coated glass below 666°C by plasma-enhanced hot filament chemical vapor deposition. Acetylene gas was used as the carbon source and ammonia gas was used as a catalyst and dilution gas. Nanotubes with controllable diameters from 20 to 400 nanometers and lengths from 0.1 to 50 micrometers were obtained. Using this method, large panels of aligned carbon nanotubes can be made under conditions that are suitable for device fabrication."

Phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) profoundly antagonized ATP inhibition of KATP channels when applied to inside-out membrane patches. It is proposed that membrane-incorporated PIPs can bind to positive charges in the cytoplasmic region of the channel's Kir6.2 subunit, stabilizing the open state of the channel and antagonizing the inhibitory effect of ATP. The tremendous effect of PIPs on ATP sensitivity suggests that in vivo alterations of membrane PIP levels will have substantial effects on KATP channel activity and hence on the gain of metabolism-excitation coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2082648108,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–sensitive potassium (K ATP ) channels couple electrical activity to cellular metabolism through their inhibition by intracellular ATP. ATP inhibition of K ATP channels varies among tissues and is affected by the metabolic and regulatory state of individual cells, suggesting involvement of endogenous factors. It is reported here that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP) controlled ATP inhibition of cloned K ATP channels (K ir 6.2 and SUR1). These phospholipids acted on the K ir 6.2 subunit and shifted ATP sensitivity by several orders of magnitude. Receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C resulted in inhibition of K ATP -mediated currents. These results represent a mechanism for control of excitability through phospholipids."

In comparison with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, chromosome 2 has a lower gene density, introns are more frequent, and proteins are markedly enriched in nonglobular domains. A family of surface proteins, rifins, that may play a role in antigenic variation was identified. The complete sequencing of chromosome 2 has shown that sequencing of the A+T-rich P. falciparum genome is technically feasible."

BMP4 is an early oral epithelial protein signal that directs odontogenic gene expression in mesenchyme cells of the developing mandibular arch. BMP4 was shown to inhibit expression of the homeobox gene Barx-1 and to restrict expression to the proximal, presumptive molar mesenchyme of mouse embryos at embryonic day 10. The inhibition of BMP signaling early in mandible development by the action of exogenous Noggin protein resulted in ectopic Barx-1 expression in the distal, presumptive incisor mesenchyme and a transformation of tooth identity from incisor to molar."
https://openalex.org/W2087258440,"Distributions of thalamic and cortical connections were investigated in four macaque monkeys with long-standing, accidental trauma to a forelimb, to determine whether the growth of new connections plays a role in the reorganization of somatosensory cortex that occurs after major alterations in peripheral somatosensory inputs. In each monkey, microelectrode recordings of cortical areas 3b and 1 demonstrated massive reorganizations of the cortex related to the affected limb. Injections of tracers in area 1 of these monkeys revealed normal patterns of thalamocortical connections, but markedly expanded lateral connections in areas 3b and 1. Thus, the growth of intracortical but not thalamocortical connections could account for much of the reorganization of the sensory maps in cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1983954853,"Optically gated recording and nonvolatile readout in a digital volume holographic data storage system that uses a pair of mutually incoherent light sources during recording and only one for readout were demonstrated recently. This approach used stoichiometric lithium niobate, which after post-growth processing gave rise to an at least two orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over the best materials reported previously. It is also shown that by adding certain dopants (iron and manganese) to near-stoichiometric lithium niobate, the dark storage time and gating efficiency can be increased compared with previous work. The underlying physical mechanisms of gated recording and the effectiveness of the gating process responsible for this manifold improved performance are discussed, and bipolarons and small polarons are identified as the responsible photorefractive species."
https://openalex.org/W2077351287,"To test the hypothesis that auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) is a receptor controlling auxin-mediated plant cell expansion, ABP1 complementary DNAs were expressed in a controllable fashion in tobacco plants and constitutively in maize cell lines. Induction of Arabidopsis ABP1 expression in tobacco leaf strips resulted in an increased capacity for auxin-mediated cell expansion, whereas induction of ABP1 in intact plants resulted in leaves with a normal morphology, but larger cells. Similarly, constitutive expression of maize ABP1 in maize cell lines conferred on them the capacity to respond to auxin by increasing cell size. These results support a role of ABP1 as an auxin receptor controlling plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2149464818,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (EC 2.4.2.30), the only enzyme known to synthesize ADP-ribose polymers from NAD+, is activated in response to DNA strand breaks and functions in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Mice homozygous for a disrupted gene encoding PARP are viable but have severe sensitivity to γ-radiation and alkylating agents. We demonstrate here that both 3T3 and primary embryo cells derived from PARP−/− mice synthesized ADP-ribose polymers following treatment with the DNA-damaging agent,N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, despite the fact that no PARP protein was detected in these cells. ADP-ribose polymers isolated from PARP−/− cells were indistinguishable from that of PARP+/+ cells by several criteria. First, they bound to a boronate resin selective for ADP-ribose polymers. Second, treatment of polymers with snake venom phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase yielded ribosyladenosine, a nucleoside diagnostic for the unique ribosyl-ribosyl linkages of ADP-ribose polymers. Third, they were digested by treatment with recombinant poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, an enzyme highly specific for ADP-ribose polymers. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ADP-ribose polymers are formed in PARP−/− cells in a DNA damage-dependent manner.

These results indicate that PARP is involved in maintaining genomic integrity and cell survival, especially following genotoxic insults. However, viability of the null genotype mice suggests that PARP is not essential for growth, development, or differentiation. Because there has been only a single gene product reported with PARP activity, we have used the PARP null genotype to address whether any other activities might be present that are capable of generating ADP-ribose polymers. Here, we show that cells derived from PARP−/−animals form ADP-ribose polymers, indicating the presence of enzymatic activity capable of catalyzing ADP-ribose polymer synthesis, which may represent heretofore unreported family member(s) of PARP. PARP+/+ and PARP−/−mice (strain C57BL/6) developed by Wang et al. (1Wang Z.-Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) were used for the studies described here. Primary mouse embryo or immortalized 3T3 (PARP+/+ clone A19, PARP+/− clone A4, and PARP−/− clone A1) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). Total genomic DNA from cultured cells of different PARP genetic backgrounds (+/+, +/−, and −/−) was prepared as described previously (7Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 9.1-9.62Google Scholar). DNA (10 μg) was digested withPvuII, fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized to a PARP gene-specific probe (1Wang Z.-Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), a 0.5-kbXhoI-HindIII fragment32P-radiolabeled (3.2 × 106 dpm/ng of DNA) by a random hexamer priming method (8Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out at 42 °C in 50% formamide, containing 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.25m NaCl, 3% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution (7Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 9.1-9.62Google Scholar), and 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate. After extensive washing in 2× SSPE and in 0.2× SSPE containing 1% SDS at 65 °C, blots were subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C for 6 h using Kodak Biomax MS film and intensifying screens. Cells were collected by centrifugation following removal from culture dishes with trypsin and dissolved in PBS containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and freshly prepared protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.001% aprotinin, 0.001% leupeptin. Proteins were quantified by the method of Bradford (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Following sonification for 30 s at 35% power, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm, Optitran from Schleicher & Schuell) for Western blot analyses. The blots were blocked in TBS-Tween (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v)) containing 5% fat-free dry milk and incubated with PARP antibody at 1:1333 dilution (A252, Biomol, Plymouth, PA) that was an antipeptide antibody generated against the carboxyl-terminal portion of the automodification domain of PARP. Immunoreactive material was revealed by incubating with secondary anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase (A-545, Sigma) at 1:30,000 dilution in TBS-Tween containing 5% fat-free dry milk. The Amersham ECL system was used for detection. Intracellular NAD+ was extracted from cells in midexponential phase of growth. Cell numbers were similar for PARP+/+ and PARP−/− cells within a given experiment. MNNG was prepared freshly in Me2SO so that the final concentration of the solvent was 0.5% (v/v) when added to the culture medium. Following a 20-min treatment period, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The cells were extracted using 0.5m HClO4 at 4 °C. The acid-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant fraction was adjusted to pH 7.3 with 1.0 m KOH, 0.33 mpotassium phosphate. Following removal of the potassium perchlorate precipitate, NAD+ was determined by an enzymic cycling assay as described previously (10Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For quantification of ADP-ribose polymers, cells were grown to confluence and incubated with [3H]adenine for 16 h to radiolabel the NAD+ pool. To induce ADP-ribose polymer synthesis, cells were incubated in 136 μm MNNG at 37 °C for 20 min, followed by addition of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was collected by centrifugation and applied to a dihydroxyboronyl-Bio-Rex column as described previously (11Aboul-Ela N. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The eluate containing ADP-ribose polymers was lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mm MOPS buffer, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5. The sample was digested with 1 unit of snake venom phosphodiesterase (Worthington) and 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 3 h. The digestion mixture was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and analyzed by HPLC on a 5-μm Beckman C18 ODS-reversed phase column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) using 7 mm ammonium formate, 7% methanol as the running solvent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Standards of adenosine and deoxyadenosine, 10 nmol each, were coinjected with each sample. Fig. 1 shows Southern blot analyses of total genomic DNA isolated from 3T3 cells derived from embryos of various PARP genotypes as revealed by hybridization with a previously described probe (1Wang Z.-Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Digestion of genomic DNA with PvuII generated a 4.7-kb DNA fragment in the PARP+/+ genotype, a 1.7-kb DNA fragment in the PARP−/− genotype, and both fragments in the PARP+/− genotype. The same results were observed when genomic DNA was isolated from primary mouse embryo cells obtained from the respective genotypes (data not shown). We examined for the presence of PARP protein in cultured mouse cells of various PARP genotypes using an antipeptide antibody developed against the carboxyl-terminal region of the automodification domain of PARP. A SDS-PAGE gel was loaded with a total of 30 μg of protein from 3T3 cell extracts and 60 μg of protein from primary embryo fibroblasts. The only detectable differences between the various genotypes were in the region expected for full-length PARP as shown in Fig. 2. For 3T3 cells, a band of immunoreactive material at approximately 116 kDa was observed in PARP+/+ cells, whereas a band of less intensity was observed in PARP+/− cells, and no band was detectable in the PARP null genotype. Likewise, extracts of primary embryo cells from PARP+/+ mice showed an intense band at 116 kDa whereas no PARP protein was detected in analyses of extracts of cells from PARP−/− animals (Fig. 2). The activation of PARP by treatment of cells with alkylating agents is known to lead to a rapid consumption of the cellular NAD+ pool (12Jacobson M.K. Levi V. Juarez-Salinas H. Barton R.A. Jacobson E.L. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 1797-1802PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nduka N. Skidmore C.J. Shall S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of a 20-min treatment of MNNG on the NAD+ content of 3T3 and primary embryo cells from the different PARP genotypes. Fig. 3 shows the NAD+ content of 3T3 cells of different PARP genotypes as a function of time following treatment with 68 μm MNNG (Fig. 3 B) and as a function of MNNG dose 240 min following treatment (Fig. 3 A). The data are presented as percent of control NAD+ content because of a slightly different number of cells and initial NAD+ content for the two genotypes (1.5 × 105 for PARP+/+ versus2.2 × 105 for PARP−/− cells). Initial NAD+ values were 120 and 140 pmol/sample, respectively. Both PARP+/+ and PARP−/− cells showed time- and dose-dependent depletion of NAD+, although depletion appeared to be slightly slower in the PARP−/−cells. When 500 μm benzamide, a known inhibitor of ADP-ribosyltransferases, was added to the culture medium, rates of NAD+ consumption were suppressed in cells from both genotypes. Results similar to those shown in Fig. 3 were obtained with primary embryo cells from PARP+/+ and PARP−/−mice (data not shown). Because we observed depletion of NAD+ following treatment of PARP−/− cells with MNNG, we investigated the possibility that these cells contain an activity capable of catalyzing conversion of NAD+ to ADP-ribose polymers. Both PARP+/+and PARP−/− 3T3 cells were radiolabeled with [3H]adenine and examined for the presence of ADP-ribose polymers using a method previously described (11Aboul-Ela N. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this method, ADP-ribose polymers are isolated using a boronyl resin and digested with snake venom phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase, which results in the generation of ribosyladenosine (rAdo), a nucleoside unique to the ribosyl-ribosyl linkages of ADP-ribose polymers (14Sims J.L. Juarez-Salinas H. Jacobson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The presence of radiolabeled rAdo (formed from internal polymer residues) and Ado (formed from terminal residues) was then examined by HPLC as shown in Fig. 4. Although radiolabeled Ado can result from either ADP-ribose polymers or from RNA, rAdo is diagnostic for ADP-ribose polymers (14Sims J.L. Juarez-Salinas H. Jacobson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the absence of MNNG treatment, no detectable rAdo was present in either the PARP+/+ or PARP−/− cells (Fig. 4,A and B), although small amounts of Ado were detected, most likely from a small contamination with RNA. Following treatment with 136 μm MNNG for 20 min, radiolabel co-eluting with rAdo was demonstrated in both genotypes (Fig. 4,C and D), although the amount present in the PARP−/− cells was less. Quantification is shown in Table I below from an experiment in which the specific radioactivity of the NAD+ pool in each cell type was measured. Average polymer size, estimated by the relative amounts of rAdo and Ado, was approximately 3.4 residues in PARP+/+cells and 1.7 residues in PARP−/− cells. When the ADP-ribosyltransferase inhibitor benzamide was present during the MNNG treatment, rAdo accumulation was suppressed by more than 80% in both PARP genotypes (Fig. 4, E and F). The presence of radiolabel co-eluting with rAdo indicates that PARP−/−cells retain the ability, albeit reduced, to generate ADP-ribose polymers following DNA damage. Two additional experiments were done to determine whether the radiolabel eluting at the position of rAdo was derived from ADP-ribose polymers. First, when phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase were omitted from the analyses, no radiolabel migrated at the position of rAdo for either PARP+/+ or PARP−/− cells (data not shown), demonstrating that the material was derived from polymers sensitive to these enzymes. Second, polymer preparations were treated with purified recombinant poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) before digestion with phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase. PARG specifically catalyzes hydrolysis of the ribosyl-ribosyl linkages in ADP-ribose polymer residues forming ADP-ribose (15Lin W. Amé J.-C. Aboul-Ela N. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); thus, PARG treatment should result in the loss of rAdo and the formation of Ado when ADP-ribose polymers treated with PARG are subsequently treated with phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase. The data of Fig. 5compare the results obtained with and without PARG digestion of polymers isolated from MNNG-treated PARP−/− 3T3 cells. All of the radiolabel co-eluting with rAdo was converted to Ado when polymers were treated with PARG before digestion to nucleosides, demonstrating that the polymers synthesized in PARP−/−cells serve as a substrate for PARG. The same result was obtained in studies using primary embryo cells from PARP−/− mice.Table IQuantification of ADP-ribose polymers in MNNG-treated cellsCell typeMNNGMNNG + benzamideMNNG + PARG1-aADP-ribose polymers were treated with PARG before digestion to nucleosides.pmol rAdo/106 cells3T3 PARP+/+9.31.4ND3T3 PARP−/−2.30.4<0.1PARP+/+ primary cells10.81.1NDPARP−/− primary cells0.3<0.1<0.1Cells were treated with 136 μm MNNG, and ADP-ribose polymers were isolated and quantified as described (11Aboul-Ela N.

Each analysis was conducted at least 3 times. ND means not determined. Quantitative comparisons of ADP-ribose polymer accumulation following MNNG treatment in 3T3 and primary embryo cells of various PARP genotypes are shown in Table I. The quantification of ADP-ribose polymer residues was determined by first measuring the specific radioactivity of the NAD+ pools in each cell type (11Aboul-Ela N. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), because the different growth rates of the cells result in slightly different specific radioactivities. The amount of polymer accumulated was similar in both primary embryo cells and 3T3 cells from the PARP+/+ genotype following MNNG treatment. However, the 3T3 PARP−/− cells accumulated approximately 25% of that observed in the 3T3 PARP+/+ cells, whereas in primary cells polymer accumulation was less than 3% in the null genotype compared with wild type cells. We have demonstrated in cells derived from PARP−/−mice activity that forms ADP-ribose polymers in response to DNA damage. The cultures analyzed for NAD+ and ADP-ribose polymer content were genotyped by Southern analyses to verify disruption of the PARP gene, ruling out the possibility of errors in identification or cross-contamination of cultures. In addition, we have shown by Western blot analyses that there is no detectable expression of full-length PARP protein or cross-reactive material unique to PARP−/−cultured cells. The amount of ADP-ribose polymers accumulated in PARP−/−cells following treatment with MNNG was considerably less than that measured in PARP+/+ cells. This difference was more pronounced in primary embryo cells than in 3T3 cells. The procedure used to derive 3T3 cells requires continuous cell division and may have selected for cells with a greater ability to synthesize ADP-ribose polymers. This may indicate that the ability to generate ADP-ribose polymers provides a selective advantage in growth or it may reflect a decreased expression of this activity in primary embryo cells, which are more highly differentiated than 3T3 cells. Although the PARP−/− cells showed reduced accumulation of ADP-ribose polymers following MNNG treatment, the amount of NAD+ consumed was quite similar in both genotypes. The inhibitor benzamide suppressed both NAD+ consumption and polymer accumulation, suggesting that NAD+ consumption was because of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Polymers of ADP-ribose synthesized in response to DNA damage are rapidly turned over (16Jacobson E.L. Antol K.M. Juarez-Salinas H. Jacobson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 103-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wielckens K. Schmidt A. George E. Bredehorst R. Hilz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12872-12877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, NAD+ consumption reflects total polymer synthesis. Under these rapid turnover conditions, polymer accumulation reflects the relative rates of synthesis and degradation by PARP and PARG, respectively. The amount of NAD+ consumed in experiments reported here suggests that the total amount of ADP-ribose polymers synthesized in the PARP−/− cells is similar to that in the PARP+/+ cells. Because cells from the PARP−/− mice have unaltered PARG activity (18Amé, J.-C., Jacobson, E. L., and Jacobson, M. K. (1998)Mol. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar), the net accumulation of ADP-ribose polymers would be expected to be less in PARP−/− cells, as was reported here. A decreased ability to generate polymers combined with unaltered PARG activity would also be expected to result in smaller polymer size, which also was observed. The ADP-ribose polymers synthesized in PARP−/− cells were indistinguishable from that of PARP-containing cells as determined by several criteria. Their synthesis was stimulated by DNA damage and inhibited by benzamide, they were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, they bound to dihydroxyboronyl-Bio-Rex resin, and they were converted to rAdo and Ado following treatment with snake venom phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase. The material characterized in PARP−/− cells cannot be derived from protein-bound monomers of ADP-ribose, which would have yielded only Ado using these digestion conditions. Furthermore, the ribosyl-ribosyl linkages of the polymers were digested by PARG, which is highly specific for ADP-ribose polymers. These data support the argument that PARP−/−cells are capable of synthesizing ADP-ribose polymers. Two possible explanations can be offered for the activity responsible for ADP-ribose polymer synthesis in PARP−/− cells. First, a fragment of the disrupted PARP gene may be expressed by some unknown mechanism; however, both this study and previous studies have been unable to detect expression of fragments of PARP in cells of the PARP null genotype. Alternatively, other enzymes heretofore undetected may be present as redundant activities for this metabolism. This possibility is supported by the report of nucleotide sequences representing two putative PARP genes in Zea mays (GenBank accession nos. AJ222588 and AJ222589) and a recent report of a nucleotide sequence in mice (GenBank accession no. AF072521), with significant homology to the catalytic domain PARP, which may encode a second enzyme with PARP activity. This nucleotide sequence does not contain homologous amino acid sequences to those used to raise the antibodies used in this study to detect PARP. Thus, we would not have detected the expression of this gene product in the experiments reported here. Regardless of the origin of the activity reported here in PARP−/− cells, it only partially compensates for PARP depletion. The population doubling time of PARP−/− cells was approximately 43 h compared with 20 h for PARP+/+ cells (data not shown) (5Wang Z.-Q. Stingl L. Morrison C. Jantsch M. Los M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2347-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). This extended cell cycle time is likely the result of loss of function for PARP, which is known to interact with DNA polymerase α during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (19Dantzer F. Nasheuer H.P. Vonesch J.L. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1891-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Further, PARP has been shown to be a component of the multienzyme replication complex (20Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Hilz H. Hickey R. Malkas L. Applegren N. Wu Y. Bers G. Smulson M.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11622-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized to function as a component of the DNA damage surveillance network that coordinates cellular responses to DNA damage with the replication apparatus (19Dantzer F. Nasheuer H.P. Vonesch J.L. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1891-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the observations that PARP−/− cells exhibit increased genomic instability, which is increased 4–5-fold by DNA damage. Another defect in PARP−/− cells is a decreased rate of base excision repair (4Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that PARP interacts directly with DNA repair enzymes, such as XRCC1, DNA polymerase β, and ligase III, presumably to recruit and coordinate various components of the base excision repair pathway (4Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In PARP−/−cells, the lack of PARP and the resulting DNA repair defects appear to be causal for alkylating agent-induced G2M cell cycle blocks, chromosome abnormalities, and cytotoxicity (4Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 5Wang Z.-Q. Stingl L. Morrison C. Jantsch M. Los M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2347-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Thus, deficiencies in the PARP pathway, either genetic or nutritional (21Jacobson, E. L., Shieh, W. M., and Huang, A. C. (1998)Mol. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar,22Whitacre C.M. Hashimoto H. Tsai M.L. Chatterjee S. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3697-3701PubMed Google Scholar), appear to have adverse consequences as these deficiencies have been shown to disrupt DNA repair and some apoptotic signaling pathways (6Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Iyer S. Boulares A.H. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13703-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The activity capable of ADP-ribose polymer synthesis reported here, which is similar to PARP by its sensitivity to benzamide and its activation by DNA damage, does not serve as a complete replacement for PARP, but its presence may indicate that the ability to metabolize poly(ADP-ribose) may be essential for survival and normal development."
https://openalex.org/W2081231027,"After long-term denervation of an upper limb in macaque monkeys, the representation of the face in somatosensory cortex expands over many millimeters into the silenced representation of the hand. Various brainstem and cortical mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Reorganization in the thalamus has been largely ignored. In monkeys with deafferented upper limbs for 12 to 20 years, it was found that the brainstem cuneate and the thalamic ventral posterior nuclei had undergone severe transneuronal atrophy, and physiological mapping in the thalamus revealed that the face and trunk representations were adjoined while the normally small representation of the lower face had expanded comparable to the expansion in cortex. Reorganization of brainstem and thalamic nuclei associated with slow transneuronal atrophy is likely to be a progressive process. When coupled with divergence of ascending connections, it is likely to make a substantial contribution to representational changes in cortex."

More recently, we have also documented that, in endothelial cells, when intracellular Ca2+ concentration is increased by an agonist, a regulatory cycle is initiated (2Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 9Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), wherein (i) Ca2+/calmodulin activates eNOS by disrupting the heteromeric complex formed between eNOS and caveolin; (ii) activated, caveolin-free eNOS is translocated from caveolae, probably associated with enzyme desensitization; (iii) when Ca2+ returns to basal levels, eNOS reassociates with caveolin; and (iv) the inhibitory complex is restored to caveolae, a process facilitated by eNOS palmitoylation. The role (if any) of this eNOS-caveolin regulatory cycle in cardiac myocytes, however, remains to be established. The location of eNOS in plasmalemmal caveolae and its interaction with caveolin may find several biological justifications. First, the compartmentation of eNOS with other signaling proteins may facilitate, or improve the efficacy of, the coupling between agonist stimulation and eNOS activation. We and others have, for instance, reported that G-protein-coupled receptors known to stimulate NO production, such as the muscarinic and bradykinin receptors, undergo rapid translocation and are targeted to caveolae upon agonist stimulation (10Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 11de Weerd W.F.C. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). More recently, McDonald et al. (12McDonald K.M. Zharikov S. Block E.R. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31213-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) have reported the existence of a caveolar complex between the arginine transporter CAT1 and eNOS, thereby providing a mechanism for a highly efficient delivery of substrate to eNOS. Second, the close control of eNOS activity by caveolin is probably required to maintain a low basal production of NO and protect the cell from undesired, potentially cytotoxic bursts of NO in response to subtle increases in intracellular calcium. Finally, the targeting of eNOS in plasmalemmal caveolae probably facilitates paracrine signaling by NO, a pathway most clearly delineated in the vascular wall (13Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and not yet clearly established in other tissues expressing eNOS. In cardiac myocytes, eNOS is also located within plasmalemmal caveolae, but, to date, the NO generated has only been shown to act endogenously by modulating the myocyte responsiveness to neurohumoral or mechanical stimuli. Thus, for instance, activation of eNOS in cardiac myocytes by muscarinic cholinergic agonist or by increased pacing frequencies leads to a net increase in cytosolic cGMP and subsequently to processes such as inactivation of L-type calcium current and alteration in myofilaments Ca2+ sensitivity (see Ref. 14Kelly R.A. Balligand J.-L. Smith T.W. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 363-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar for review). eNOS targeting to plasmalemmal caveolae may serve to facilitate the enzyme's proximity to receptors and G-protein-dependent signaling cascades, as well as its interactions with regulatory proteins such as caveolin and calmodulin. The caveolin isoform expressed in myocytes (caveolin-3) is only found in muscle tissue (15Way M. Parton R.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,16Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

To explore the role of eNOS acylation and caveolar targeting in receptor-dependent responses in cardiac myocytes, we used the paradigm of the muscarinic cholinergic NO-mediated regulation of heart rate previously studied in our laboratory (17Balligand J.-L. Kelly R.A. Marsden P.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 18Balligand J.-L. Kobzik L. Han X. Kaye D.M. Belhassen L.

We isolated myocytes from neonatal mice with targeted disruption of the eNOS gene and transfected these cells with cDNA constructs encoding the wild-type eNOS or a myristoylation-deficient eNOS mutant. Thus, these transfections provided us with myocytes expressing eNOS protein in the caveolae or in the cytosolic compartment. We introduced a step of selection of transfected myocytes to isolate highly uniform cell populations to permit the study the physiological responses of myocytes, and we have characterized the responses of these selected cells to the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol. This experimental approach has permitted us to reconstitute, within cells deficient only in the protein of interest, the differential coupling of muscarinic cholinergic responses mediated by wild-typeversus acylation-deficient eNOS. The role of caveolin-3 in this signaling system was further explored in rat neonatal myocytes reversibly permeabilized and loaded with peptides corresponding to the caveolin scaffolding domain. Hearts were removed from 2-day-old mice with targeted disruption of eNOS (eNOSnullmice (19Huang P.L. Huang Z. Moshimo H. Block K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.S. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Paul Huang and Mark Fishman, Massachusetts General Hospital), were trimmed free of atrial tissues, and incubated with trypsin and collagenase, as described (20Springhorn J.P. Glaycomb W.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions underwent two preplating steps to minimize contamination with non-myocyte cells; in some experiments, cardiac myocytes were isolated from neonatal rats exactly as described (21Ogawa S. Barnett J.V. Sen L. Galper J.B. Smith T.W. Marsh J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dissociated cells were placed in culture medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified essential medium, 7.5% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated on 10-mm coverslips or 35-mm dishes and incubated at 37 °C in 95% O2, 5% CO2. After 24 h of culture, myocytes from eNOSnull neonatal mice were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA constructs encoding wild-type (WT) eNOS and the myristoylation-deficient (myr−) eNOS mutant have been described previously (5Feron O. Michel J.B. Sase K. Michel T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that this myr− eNOS mutant, as a consequence of its myristoylation site's being inactivated,undergoes neither myristoylation nor palmitoylation, and is therefore acylation-deficient. Caveolin-3 cDNA in the eukaryotic expression vector pCB-7 was obtained from Michael Lisanti (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA), and pHook-1 is from Invitrogen; an irrelevant plasmid encoding β-galactosidase (pcDNA3.1 vector, Invitrogen) was used as a control to maintain identical total amounts of DNA in each transfection. In addition, the β-galactosidase activity was monitored with a colorimetric assay (β-galactosidase staining kit, Invitrogen) to optimize and evaluate the transfection efficiency. To isolate transfected myocytes from untransfected cells, we have used the Capture-Tec kit (Invitrogen), which allows rapid selection and isolation of transiently transfected cells. This system utilizes the vector pHook-1 that expresses and displays a single-chain antibody (sFv) against the specific hapten phOX (4-ethoxy-methylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one) on the surface of transfected cells. The antibody is fused at the C terminus to the transmembrane domain from platelet-derived growth factor receptor allowing the antibody to be anchored and displayed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. Cells expressing the sFv can then be isolated from the culture by binding to hapten-coated magnetic beads and a strong magnet. Briefly, the pHook-1 plasmid was added to the eNOS and/or caveolin-3 constructs in a 1:1 molar ratio, and myocytes were transfected with the plasmid mixture. 36 h after transfection, myocytes were detached from the 35-mm plates by using PBS containing 3 mm EDTA, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The cell suspension was added to a tube containing 2 × 106Capture-Tec magnetic beads (Invitrogen) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C on a slow rotor. To select cells, the tubes were placed in a magnetic stand and mixed for 1 min. The nonselected cells were removed with a pipette and the beads resuspended in 1 ml of medium. The steps of selection and washing were repeated twice, and the transfected myocytes were finally resuspended in 300 μl of medium and plated on 10-mm coverslips for 36 h before utilization in contractility experiments. Myocytes were reversibly permeabilized by using a method modified from Morgan and Morgan (23Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1982; 395: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and Johnson et al. (24Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, after culturing rat neonatal myocytes on 10-mm coverslips placed in 24-well plates for 96 h, media (referred to as conditioned media) were removed, saved, and placed at 37 °C. The cells were then slowly brought down in temperature by two sequential incubations with 0.5 ml of fresh PBS: the first one was carried out (with PBS prewarmed at 37 °C) for 10 min at room temperature and the second for 30 min on ice. The PBS was discarded, and freshly prepared permeabilization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaN3, and 5 mm oxalic acid dipotassium salt) was added to the cells with the desired peptides and 5 mm ATP for 15 min on ice. The cells were then washed five times with 0.5 ml of chilled PBS and incubated in the final PBS at room temperature. After 15-min recovery, the PBS was removed, replaced by 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1 mm Ca2+, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Finally, the PBS was gently aspirated, and the conditioned medium was added back to cells at 37 °C. The cells were used in contraction experiments after an additional 30-min incubation at 37 °C. The spontaneous and carbachol-modulated beating rate of neonatal myocytes was determined on a temperature-controlled chamber on the stage of a microscope connected to a videomotion analyzer (17Balligand J.-L. Kelly R.A. Marsden P.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar); light-dark contrast at the cell edge was used as a marker for the measurement of the frequency of cell shortening. Peptides were synthesized corresponding to the amino acids 55–74 scaffolding domain of rat caveolin-3 (DGVWRVSYTTFTVSKYWCYR, termed Cav-3 herein) (25Couet J. Shengwen L. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), to an rearranged version of the caveolin-3 peptide (WGVDRVFYTTSTVSYKWCRY, termed Cav-3X). These peptides were synthesized by the Biopolymers Facilities of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Harvard Medical School and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The basal and agonist-stimulated intracellular cGMP production was determined by cGMP enzyme immunoassay. Briefly, neonatal myocytes were used 96 h after plating on 35-mm plates,e.g. 72 h after transfection for the eNOSnull mice myocytes. After removing the medium, cells were washed twice with Locke's buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mmNaHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were then equilibrated at 37 °C for 30 min in Locke's buffer containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 1 mml-arginine or 1 mml-NNA. Superoxide dismutase (100 units/ml) was added at 25 min of the equilibrium period. Myocytes were treated with 5 μm carbachol or 10 μm3-morpholinosydnominine (SIN-1) for 3 min at 37 °C, the medium was rapidly removed, and the reaction was terminated with ice-cold 0.1m HCl. Following 20-min incubation on ice, cells were scrapped, and the extracts were collected, neutralized by NaOH, and buffered with 2.5 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8. After centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g, cGMP levels in the supernatant were determined by a specific enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Experiments were performed in triplicate, and data were calibrated against standard curves. Note that the contractility experiments were performed on transfected myocytes selected with the Capture-Tec kit (Invitrogen), whereas the cGMP experiments were analyzed in transfected but unselected cells. Isolated eNOSnull mice myocytes were first cultured on 35-mm plates for 24 h and then transfected with a cDNA construct encoding either the WT eNOS or the acylation-deficient myr− eNOS mutant. Myocytes were collected 72 h after transfection, and the subcellular distribution of eNOS as well as its association with caveolin-3 were analyzed. Differential centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h) revealed that WT eNOS was almost exclusively recovered in the particulate fraction in contrast to the myr− eNOS mutant, which was found in the supernatant fraction of transfected myocytes (Fig. 1). Furthermore, WT eNOS was nearly completely co-immunoprecipitated by its interaction with the endogenous caveolin-3 that is present in neonatal myocytes (Fig. 1). In contrast, the cytosolic myr− mutant was not immunoprecipitated by caveolin-3 antibodies. To enrich for transfected cells, and perform physiological analyses on a more uniform population of cells for contractility studies, the transfected eNOSnull mice myocytes were selected using magnetic beads as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” β-Galactosidase activity determination revealed that more than 70–85% of the cells selected by the Capture-Tec kit were transfected versus less than 10% in the unselected cells (not shown). The transfected neonatal myocytes usually started to beat spontaneously 24 h after selection,e.g. 3–4 days after their original isolation. The agonist-dependent regulation of the beating rate was studied 36 h after selection at which time the spontaneous beating rate had stabilized. After 15 min of equilibration in superfusion buffer, the spontaneous beating rate was not different in myocytes expressing WT eNOS or the myr− eNOS mutant (71 ± 7 beats/min versus 73 ± 5 beats/min, respectively;n = 6). Neonatal myocytes issued from wild-type backcrossed animals were used as a control phenotype of myocytes otherwise genetically identical but expressing native eNOS. Carbachol (10 μm) completely abrogated the beating rate of these control myocytes (Fig. 2 A) as well as of 75% eNOSnull mice myocytes transfected with WT eNOS cDNA (Fig. 2 B); the 15–30% proportion of nonresponding myocytes likely is accounted by the residual nontransfected myocytes remaining in this preparation. The effect persisted through the duration of superfusion and was slowly, but completely, reversible after drug washout (not shown);l-NNA was able to prevent the decrease in beating rate when added to the cells 30 min before stimulation (Fig. 2 C). By contrast, in myocytes expressing the myr− eNOS protein, carbachol did not induce significant changes in the rate of contraction (Fig. 2 D). Furthermore, to address the role of the caveolin-eNOS interaction in the muscarinic cholinergic regulation of cardiac function, we have next co-transfected neonatal myocytes from eNOSnull mice with constructs encoding for WT-eNOS and caveolin-3. The results presented in Fig. 2 E show that when exogenous caveolin-3 was co-expressed in our system, carbachol did not decrease the beating rate of WT eNOS myocytes. In several experiments, a small positive chronotropic effect was even observed in the myocytes co-transfected with WT eNOS and caveolin-3 (Fig. 2 E). Since the signal transduction cascade linking muscarinic cholinergic receptor stimulation, eNOS, and neonatal myocyte contraction appears to act via guanylyl cyclase activation, we next examined the cGMP levels in myocytes transfected with constructs encoding WT NOS or myr− eNOS. As shown in Fig. 3 A, carbachol significantly increased cGMP levels in WT eNOS myocytes, an effect that could be blocked by the NOS inhibitor, l-NNA. In contrast, carbachol had no effect on cellular cGMP levels in myr− eNOS myocytes (Fig. 3 A). To demonstrate that this absence of effect was due to the lack of the functional coupling between the mAchR and eNOS, the calcium ionophore A23187 was used to artificially increase the intracellular calcium concentration. As depicted in Fig. 3 A, 25 μm A23187 markedly increase cGMP levels in myocytes, 5.9-fold in myr− eNOS myocytesversus 6.9-fold in WT-eNOS myocytes. Finally, to verify that cGMP levels in myocytes are elevated by NO and that guanylyl cyclase is similarly expressed in both types of transfected myocytes, the pharmacological NO donor SIN-1 was employed. Fig. 3 A shows that SIN-1 increased, to the same extent, cGMP levels in myocytes transfected with the WT eNOS or the myr− eNOS constructs. Finally, we observed a dramatic decrease in the basal and carbachol-stimulated levels of cGMP in myocytes expressing WT-eNOS in association with recombinant caveolin-3, suggesting that the cellular caveolin pool is critical for regulating eNOS activation (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, increased expression of caveolin-3 in the myr− eNOS myocytes did not change the cGMP amounts in resting and carbachol-stimulated cells; this is entirely consistent with the lack of compartmentation of the myr− eNOS protein within caveolin-enriched plasmalemmal microdomains. To address the specificity of the interaction between eNOS and caveolin-3, we have used an approach that allows specific peptides to enter cultured myocytes by reversible cell permeabilization. The method was developed by Morgan and Morgan (23Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1982; 395: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) for loading aequorin in vascular smooth muscle cells; the reversible permeabilization is ensured by the exposure of myocytes to an ice-cold solution containing a Ca2+ chelator and the peptide, followed by the progressive rewarming of the medium bathing the myocytes and the restoration of physiological calcium concentration. In contrast to a more recent methodology specifically developed by Johnson et al. (24Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to transiently permeabilize cardiac myocytes, our method does not require the use of detergents such as saponin but still allows the introduction of control polydextran (molecular mass: 5–100 kDa, Molecular Probe) into the cells. 2K. G. Morgan, unpublished observations. In preliminary experiments, we observed that saponin did not improve the delivery of peptides to the myocytes but instead altered their viability and contractile properties. We next studied neonatal rat myocytes, which endogenously express WT eNOS and caveolin-3; these cells were reversibly permeabilized to introduce synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the scaffolding domain of caveolin-3. The caveolin scaffolding domain peptide corresponding to residues 55–74 of the rat caveolin-3 sequence is termed Cav-3. A scrambled peptide was designed wherein residues were exchanged pairwise at eight highly conserved positions within the 20 amino acid sequence of the Cav-3 peptide. This use of this conservatively designed peptide as control, which shares 100% identical amino acid composition and 60% amino acid sequence identity with the Cav-3 peptide, helps to provide confidence in the specificity of effects seen with the Cav-3 peptide. The rat neonatal myocytes usually started to beat spontaneously 3 days after isolation, and the rate of beating stabilized in the next 12–24 h. The permeabilization protocol did not significantly alter the beating rate which amounted 70 ± 3 and 72 ± 4 min−1 (n = 5), before and after the peptide loading. As shown in Fig. 4 A, when sham-permeabilized myocytes were exposed to 1 μm carbachol, the myocyte contractility was completely abrogated; several minutes of washout were required to restore the initial beating rate (not shown). By contrast, in neonatal myocytes loaded with the Cav-3 peptide, carbachol did not induce any change in beating rate (Fig. 4 B). The specificity of this effect was demonstrated by using myocytes loaded with the control peptide Cav-3X (Fig. 4 C). With this scrambled control peptide, we never observed a suppression of the inhibitory effect of carbachol on the rate of myocyte contraction. cGMP determinations were performed on parallel myocyte cultures and revealed that the Cav-3 peptide inhibits the carbachol-evoked increase in cGMP levels to the same extent as observed with the NOS inhibitorl-NNA applied on sham-permeabilized myocytes (Fig. 4 D). Importantly, the Cav-3X peptide failed to reverse the ∼4-fold increase in cGMP observed in control native myocytes (Fig. 4 D). In this study, we have used two complementary experimental approaches to address the functional role of the subcellular targeting and caveolin-3 interactions of eNOS in cardiac myocytes. First, we used myocytes isolated from eNOSnull mice and devised an efficient transfection and selection procedure that permitted us to study expression of recombinant eNOS cDNAs re-introduced into a normal physiological mileu. A second experimental approach used a reversible permeabilization protocol to introduce into intact rat myocytes a caveolin scaffolding peptide corresponding to the consensus sequence implicated in the protein-protein interactions of caveolin with eNOS. Collectively, our findings confirm the obligatory role of eNOS in coupling muscarinic receptor activation to the control of myocyte beating rate and indicate that the caveolar targeting of eNOS and its close regulation by caveolin-3 may serve to modulate the parasympathetic regulation of heart rate. The native enzyme eNOS must undergo dual acylation by myristate and palmitate to be targeted to the specialized plasmalemmal microdomains termed caveolae (1Sase K. Michel T. Trends Cardiovasc.

We found that in transfected neonatal eNOSnull mice myocytes, expression of the acylation-deficient myr− eNOS mutant is restricted to the cell cytosol (1Sase K. Michel T. Trends Cardiovasc.

By contrast, the distribution of recombinant WT eNOS expressed in transfected neonatal eNOSnull mice myocytes is similar to that of native myocyte eNOS (4Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W.

Using a powerful system of magnet-based cell selection, providing a uniform cell system suitable for physiological testing, we are able to rescue the phenotype of myocytes with targeted disruption of the eNOS gene by transfections with WT but not acylation-deficient myr− eNOS. Thus, in eNOSnull myocytes expressing recombinant WT eNOS, the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol elicited a strong negative chronotropic response and markedly activated cGMP production, whereas in the myr− eNOS mutant transfected myocytes, there was no response whatsoever to carbachol stimulation (Figs. 2 and 3). Importantly, the calcium ionophore A23187, which increases intracellular Ca2+ in a receptor-independent fashion, increases cellular cGMP levels similarly in myocytes expressing the WT or myr− mutant. We may therefore postulate that the myr− eNOS mutant is uncoupled from the muscarinic receptor because of the mutant's aberrant subcellular localization and failure to target to caveolae. Besides these findings, the rescuing of eNOSnull mice myocytes by WT eNOS transfection provides an unequivocal demonstration that eNOS activation is essential for muscarinic cholinergic control of the heart rate. Together with our recent work (26Han X. Kubota I. Feron O. Opel D.J. Arstall M.A. Zhao Y.-Y. Huang P. Fishman M.C. Michel T. Kelly R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6510-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that explored muscarinic cholinergic control of ventricular L-type calcium current in adult eNOSnull and wild-type mice, eNOS activation within myocytes appears to be a critical mediator of the negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of parasympathetic stimulation in the mammalian heart. In endothelial cells, we have documented that caveolin-1 interacts specifically with eNOS and maintains the enzyme in its inactivated state. The current study presents the first evidence that caveolin-3 regulates eNOS activity in intact cells. We report here that the expression of exogenous caveolin-3 in our system completely abrogated the cGMP-dependent negative chronotropic effect of carbachol observed in WT eNOS myocytes. This hypothesis is in agreement with the small increase in the spontaneous beating rate (e.g. positive chronotropic effect) observed in WT eNOS myocytes in which the cellular caveolin-3 pool is increased by co-expression of recombinant caveolin-3 (see Fig. 2 E). Moreover, in myocytes co-transfected with the caveolin-3 construct, the cGMP amounts in the WT eNOS myocytes were significantly lower than in caveolin-3 transfected myr− eNOS myocytes, consistent with a model in which the cytosolic myr− eNOS is not tonically repressed by plasmalemmal caveolin. Peptides derived from the scaffolding domain of caveolin-3 appear to inhibit the activity of purified eNOS and other caveolin-associated enzymes in vitro (see Ref. 27Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar for review). In the present studies, we have shown that neonatal rat myocytes can be loaded with peptides corresponding to the caveolin-3 scaffolding domain (Cav-3), leading to the blockade of both the negative chronotropic effect and the cGMP increase induced by carbachol. A highly similar control peptide (Cav-3X) has no effect on muscarinic coupling in this experimental system, providing confidence in the specificity of the effects seen with the Cav-3 peptide (see Fig. 4). Our results provide an interesting contrast to those of Venema et al. (28Venema V.J. Ju H. Zou R. Venema R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28187-28190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) who reported studies suggesting that an additional C-terminal sequence within caveolin, distinct from the caveolin scaffolding domain analyzed in this report, may be involved in interactions between caveolin-3 and the neuronal isoform of nitric-oxide synthase. However, the caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide used in these studies is sufficient to completely block the muscarinic response. Mutations in the caveolin-3 gene, leading to alterations in caveolin-3 protein in muscle fibers, cause an autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (29Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Brado M. Masetti E. Mazzoco M. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonte D. Glbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). It seems plausible that derangements in the eNOS/caveolin-3 association may directly affect cardiac myocyte physiological responses. The present studies have established in cardiac myocytes a key role for caveolin-3 both in the regulation of eNOS enzyme activity and the enzyme's subcellular targeting, thereby extending the paradigm of the caveolin-1/eNOS regulatory cycle previously established in endothelial cells (9Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Furthermore, acylation of eNOS is required for coupling the enzyme's physiological stimulus (muscarinic cholinergic activation) to its physiological response (e.g. negative chronotropic effect), a signaling pathway closely regulated by caveolin-3. Thus, the caveolar compartmentation of eNOS plays an apparently paradoxical role, both tonically repressing basal eNOS activity by the enzyme's interactions with caveolin-3, but also ensuring the efficient activation of the enzyme upon agonist stimulation. Further studies are required to determine whether pathological conditions might lead to a modulation of caveolin expression or function and thereby modulate NO-dependent physiological processes both in cardiac myocytes and vascular endothelium. We are grateful to Drs. Paul Huang and Mark Fishman for providing the eNOSnull mice from which we isolated cardiac myocytes used in these studies."

A model is proposed by which gene amplification during selective growth can give the appearance of adaptive mutability without requiring any change in mutability. The model is based on two assumptions, that a mutant lac locus with residual function allows growth if its copy number is increased, and that true reversion events are made more likely by replication of chromosomes with many copies of the locus. Apparent directed mutability, its recombination requirement, and its apparent independence of cell growth are all accounted for by the model.

The iSH2 domain of p85 is sufficient to bind p110α but does not inhibit it. Inhibition of p110α requires the presence of the nSH2 domain linked to the iSH2 domain.

The p85 regulatory subunit contains an N-terminal SH3 domain followed by a proline rich domain, a breakpoint cluster region-homology domain, a second proline-rich domain, and two SH2 domains linked by a putative coiled coil domain (the inter-SH2 or iSH2 domain) that binds to the N terminus of the p110α catalytic subunit (2Otsu M.

McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and experimentally distinguished two effects of p85 on p110α: inhibition of its lipid kinase activity and stabilization against thermal inactivation. The inhibition of p110α by the p85 subunit is clearly seen during in vitroreconstitution experiments, where dimerization with p85 decreases p110 activity by 80%. The activity of p85/p110α dimers is increased when phosphotyrosyl peptides bind to the p85 SH2 domains, but to a level no greater than that of the corresponding amount of monomeric p110α. These data suggest that phosphopeptide activation of p85/p110 dimers reflects a transition between inhibited and disinhibited states. In addition to its inhibition of p110α, p85 stabilizes p110α against thermal denaturation. Recombinant p110α monomers lose activity rapidly when incubated at 37 °C, whereas p85/p110α dimers are stable, and coexpression of p85 with p110α in mammalian cells significantly increases the half-life of p110α (11Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid inactivation of p110α at 37 °C explains a longstanding discrepancy between mammalian and insect cells (12Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 419-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar): monomeric p110α is active in insect cells but not mammalian cells because of differences in their culture temperatures (27 versus 37 °C). However, the stabilization of p110α by p85 in mammalian cells is mimicked by addition of bulky epitope tags to the N terminus of p110α (11Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the stabilization by p85 appears to involve the overall conformation of p110α rather than the induction of a specific activated state. In this paper, we examine the regulation of p110α by p85 in detail. We find that the iSH2 domain of p85 is sufficient to bind p110α but does not affect its activity. Inhibition of p110α requires the presence of the nSH2 domain linked to the iSH2 domain. Phosphopeptide binding to the nSH2 domain can directly modulate p110α activity. In contrast, phosphopeptide binding to the cSH2 domain modulates p110α activity by a mechanism that requires residues 1–322 of p85 (the SH3, BCR homology and proline-rich domains) and the nSH2 domain. These data suggest that the nSH2 domain is the principle regulator of p85/p110α activity. The GST-nSH2/iSH2/cSH2 construct (in pGEX-3X) has been previously described (8Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The GST-iSH2 construct was created by PCR amplification of residues 431–600 of human p85, followed by subcloning into pGEX-2T. The nSH2/iSH2 construct was created by introducing two STOP codons after the codon corresponding to p85 residue 600 in the GST-nSH2/iSH2/cSH2 construct. The GST-iSH2/cSH2 construct was produced by PCR amplification of residues 431–724 of p85, followed by subcloning into pGEX-2T. Full-length N-terminal HA-tagged p85 (10Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J.

Point mutations in the nSH2 domain (R358A) and cSH2 domain (R659A) of the pGEX-nSH2/iSH2/cSH2 construct were introduced, and XhoI/EcoRI fragments from these mutated constructs were subcloned into pGEX-p85 to produce pGEX-p85-R358A and pGEX-p85-R659A. All mutations were produced with the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit and confirmed by sequencing. N-terminal Myc-tagged p110α was produced in baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells as described previously (11Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell.

Recombinant GST-fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL-21 and isolated on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione, dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline, and stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Alternatively, bead-bound fusion proteins were washed into 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH. 7.8, cleaved with thrombin (25 units in 2 ml), lyophilized and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (350 μg/ml).

After 3 more washes, absorbed proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-iSH2 antibodies (13McIlroy J. Chen D.X. Wjasow C. Michaeli T. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell.

The samples were washed and absorbed proteins were analyzed by blotting with monoclonal anti-myc antibodies (Oncogene Science)/rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibodies followed by125I-Protein A, and reblotting with rabbit anti-GST antibodies. 35 μl of lysate from control Sf-9 cells or Sf-9 cells expressingN-myc-p110α were incubated with 5 μg of recombinant p85 or p85 fragment for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were then assayed directly for PI 3-kinase activity using sonicated phosphatidylinositol as a substrate as described previously (11Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, mixtures of p110α and p85 or fragments of p85 were incubated in the absence or presence of a bisphosphotyrosyl peptide derived from the Tyr-608/Tyr-628 region of IRS-1 (1 μm) and assayed for PI 3′-kinase activity as described previously (10Rordorf-Nikolic T.

After 30 min at 4 °C, the samples were irradiated on ice at 350 nm for 1 h and analyzed as described previously (10Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). p110α is maximally active as a monomer, and is inhibited by dimerization with p85 (11Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the domains of p85 required for this inhibition, we compared the activity of p110α when reconstituted with a fragment of p85 containing the C-terminal half of p85 (nSH2-iSH2-cSH2), or the iSH2 domain of p85 alone (Fig. 1 A). Work from several laboratories have identified the iSH2 domain of p85 as the region that binds to p110α (14Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 15Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, both the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 and iSH2 fragments of p85 bound to immobilized p110α-beads, but not to control beads (Fig. 1 B). Incubation of p110α with the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment inhibited its activity by approximately 80% (Fig. 1 C, lane b), and subsequent incubation of bisphosphotyrosyl peptide with either the p85/p110α or nSH2-iSH2-cSH2/p110α dimers increased their activity by 100% (Fig. 1 D, lanes a and b). Surprisingly, the iSH2 domain could bind p110α (Fig. 1 B) but had no effect on its activity (Fig. 1 C, lane c). These data show that binding by the iSH2 domain to p110α is not sufficient to inhibit its catalytic activity, and suggest that the SH2 domains exert an additional constraint on p110α activity. Dhandet al. (14Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) predicted that the iSH2 domain of p85 should exist as two antiparallel helices, which would place the SH2 domains of p85 is close apposition. It is possible that the two SH2 domains are close enough contact each other, thereby imposing a strained conformation of the iSH2 domain. This strain would be relieved by conformational changes in either SH2 domain upon phosphopeptide binding. Alternatively, each SH2 domain could independently affect the conformation of the iSH2 domain or p110α. Both models are consistent with previous data showing partial activation from either SH2 domain (10Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, the first model predicts that both SH2 domains would be required for inhibition of p110α, whereas the second model predicts that the iSH2 domain linked to either SH2 domain would partially inhibit p110α. To distinguish between these models, we measured p110α activity in the presence of p85 fragments containing the iSH2 domain linked to single SH2 domains (Fig. 2 A). We first established that the fragments bound to p110α. We incubated recombinant nSH2/iSH2 or iSH2/cSH2 with control beads or beads containing immobilized p110α (Fig. 2 B, left panel). Alternatively, we incubated recombinant p110α (produced in HEK 293T cells) with immobilized GST-nSH2/iSH2 and GST-iSH2/cSH2 (Fig. 2 B, right panel). Both constructs bound to p110α, although binding by the nSH2/iSH2 construct was slighter higher than binding by the iSH2/cSH2 construct. We next measured p110α activity in the presence of the two constructs. The nSH2-iSH2 fragment inhibited p110α to the same extent as the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment, suggesting that contact between the SH2 domains is not required for inhibition of p110α (Fig. 2 C, lanes b and c). Moreover, the activity of both nSH2-iSH2/p110α dimers and nSH2-iSH2-cSH2/p110α dimers were increased 100% by tyrosine phosphopeptides (Fig. 2 D, lanes a and b). These data show that the nSH2-iSH2 domain fragment is sufficient to mediate inhibition and phosphopeptide disinhibition of p110α. Surprisingly, dimerization of p110α with the iSH2-cSH2 fragment was only slight inhibitory (Fig. 2 C, lane d), and no increase in activity was seen in the presence of tyrosine phosphopeptide (Fig. 2 D, lane c). These data suggest that the C-terminal SH2 domain contributes little to the inhibition of p110α, which is primarily because of the N-terminal SH2 domain. We have previously shown that in dimers containing p110α and intact p85, both SH2 domains contribute to the increase in activity caused by tyrosine phosphopeptides (10Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the activity of p110α when bound to nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 constructs containing disabling point mutations in the conserved FLVRES motifs of the N-terminal or C-terminal SH2 domains (R358A and R659A, respectively; Fig. 3 A). These point mutations abolish phosphopeptide binding to the nSH2 and cSH2 domains, respectively (10Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). p110α was inhibited to similar extents by the wild-type nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment and the mutant nSH2(R358A)-iSH2-cSH2 and nSH2-iSH2-cSH2(R659A) fragments (Fig. 3 B, lanes c-e). This was expected, because others have shown that point mutations within the FLVRES motif do not perturb the overall structure of SH2 domains (18Mayer B.J. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides had similar effects on the activity of p110α bound to the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 and nSH2-iSH2-cSH2(R659A) fragments (Fig. 3 C, lanes band c), with a 100–150% increase in activity. However, phosphopeptides had no effect on the activity of p110α bound to the nSH2(R358A)-iSH2-cSH2 fragment (Fig. 3 C, lane d). This was not because of a differences in phosphopeptide binding to the wild type SH2 domain in each construct, because [125I]-Bolton-Hunter labeled phosphotyrosyl peptides bound with similar affinity to the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2(R659A) and nSH2(R358A)-iSH2-cSH2 fragments (Fig. 3 D). The inability of the cSH2 domain to mediate phosphopeptide activation of the nSH2(R358A)-iSH2-cSH2/p110α dimers was inconsistent with our earlier experiments showing that both the nSH2 and cSH2 domains contributed to phosphotyrosyl peptide activation of p85/p110α dimers (10Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The discrepancy could be because of differential post-translational processing of the constructs in bacteria as opposed to insect cells. Alternatively, the cSH2 domain might function differently in the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment as opposed to intact p85. We therefore produced bacterial GST-fusion proteins containing full-length wild-type p85, as well as p85 containing disabling mutations in the nSH2 and cSH2 domains (R358A and R659A, respectively; Fig. 4 A). All of the bacterial p85 constructs inhibited p110α to the same extent as p85 produced in baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells (p85Sf-9) (data not shown). Incubation of phosphopeptides with either p110α/GST-p85 dimers or p110α/p85Sf-9 dimers increased activity by 120–130% (Fig. 4 B, lanes a and b). Phosphopeptides also increased the activity of GST-p85 constructs containing mutant SH2 domains; the activity of nSH2-iSH2-cSH2(R659A)/p110α dimers increased by 90%, and the activity of nSH2(R358A)-iSH2-cSH2/p110α dimers increased by 50% (Fig. 4 B, lanes c and d). These data confirm our earlier report that both N-terminal and C-terminal SH2 can partially mediate phosphopeptide activation of p85/p110α dimers. They also show that the different results obtained with wild-type p85 and the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment were not because of aberrant processing in bacterial cells. Instead, they suggest that the residues 1–322 of p85 play a role in the regulation of p85/p110α by phosphopeptides. Activation by the cSH2 domain occurred only in the context of intact p85, whereas activation by the nSH2 domain occurred in the absence of the cSH2 domain or residues 1–322 of p85 (the SH3, BCR-homology and proline-rich domains). We have previously shown that p85 is an inhibitor of p110α activity, and that binding of tyrosyl phosphopeptides to the p85 SH2 domains relieves this inhibition (11Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that the SH2 domains of p85 are critical for the inhibitory effects of p85 on p110α. Consistent with previous reports, we find that the iSH2 domain of p85 is sufficient to bind to p110α (14Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 15Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5560-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Holt K.H. Olson A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, iSH2 domain binding alone does not affect p110α activity. Instead, the presence of an SH2 domain linked to the N terminus of the iSH2 domain is required for inhibition of p110α. Two mechanisms could explain the inhibition of p110α by the nSH2/iSH2versus iSH2 fragments. The iSH2 domain is predicted to form a coiled-coil domain (14Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The presence of an nSH2 domain at the N-terminal end of the iSH2 domain could exert a conformational strain on the coiled-coil and alter its interactions with p110α. Alternatively, the nSH2 domain may directly contact p110α, inhibiting its activity. In both mechanisms, conformational changes induced by phosphoprotein binding to the nSH2 domain would relieve the inhibition of p110α. We have no direct experimental evidence to distinguish these hypotheses at this time. However, we have noticed that unlike the iSH2 domain itself, a GST-iSH2 fusion protein binds p110α and inhibits its activity by 50%. Inhibition by attachment of a bulky GST moiety to the N terminus of the iSH2 domain is consistent with the first mechanism. Also consistent with this model is a recent paper by Jimenez et al. (19a) describing an oncogenic truncated p85 molecule. Expression of this mutant with p110α caused an increase in activity as compared with wild-type p85, which we would interpret as the loss of p85-induced inhibition of p110α. Since the nSH2 domain is present in the truncation mutant, the loss of inhibition would seem to be because of a conformational change in the iSH2 domain caused by the removal of its extreme C terminus. On the other hand, Cooper and Kashishian reported a direct interaction between p110α and the p85 nSH2 domain in transfected cells (19Cooper J.A. Kashishian A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (19a. Jimenez, C., Jones, D. R., Rodriguez-Viciana, P., Gonzalez-Garcia, A., Leonardo, E., Wennstrom, S., von Kobbe, C., Toran, J. L., R.-Borlado, L., Calvo, V., Copin, S. G., Albar, J. P., Gaspar, M. L., Diez, E., Marcos, M. A. R., Downward, J., Martinez-A., C., Merida. I., and Carrera, A. C. (1998) EMBO J. 17, 743–753): 1737-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which would be consistent with the second mechanism. Importantly, the iSH2 domain itself neither activates nor inhibits p110α. In contrast, others have suggested that iSH2 domain binding to p110α provides critical activating interactions that are required for p110α activity in mammalian cells (20Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and attachment of the iSH2 domain to p110 has been used to produce a constitutively active enzyme (21Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). However, attachment of bulky moieties such as GST or a tris-HA tag to the N terminus of p110α increases the activity of monomeric p110α activity in mammalian cells by stabilizing the protein (11Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the iSH2 domain has no effect on p110α activity in vitro, we think it likely that the iSH2-p110α chimera is active because of the attachment of a bulky group, rather than the provision of specific activating interactions. A surprising finding in this study is the marked difference in the roles of the nSH2 and cSH2 domains. The nSH2/iSH2 fragment inhibits p110α, and nSH2/iSH2-p110α complexes are activated by phosphotyrosine peptides. In contrast, iSH2/cSH2 fragments bind p110α but have little effect on its activity. Phosphopeptide binding to the cSH2 domain does contribute to p110α activation, but only in the context of the entire p85 protein. Thus, phosphopeptide modulation of p110α via the cSH2 domain appears to be distinct from modulation via the nSH2 domain. Previous studies have suggested that intramolecular interactions may occur between the SH3 domain and the proline-rich domain of p85 (22Kapeller R. Prasad K.V.S. Janssen O. Hou W. Schaffhausen B.S. Rudd C.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1927-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the cSH2 domain, SH3-PRD domains, and the nSH2 domain may form a compact structure (Fig. 5). Our data would suggest that the nSH2 domain is the major regulator of p110α activity, and that occupancy of the nSH2 domain induces a conformational change (23Shoelson S.E. Sivaraja M. Williams K.P. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Weiss M.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Panayotou G. Bax B. Gout I. Federswisch M. Wrobolowski B., R. Dhand Fry M.J. Blundell T.L. Wollmer A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4261-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that is transmitted to the iSH2 domain and/or p110α (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, phosphopeptide occupancy of the cSH2 domain may induce a conformational change that is transmitted to the regulatory nSH2 domain by way of residues 1–322 of p85 (the SH2, Bcr and proline-rich domains) (Fig. 5 B). This model would predict that disruption of intramolecular interactions within the SH3 and proline-rich domains of p85 would minimize phosphopeptide-induced activation via the cSH2 domain, but would not affect activation via the nSH2 domain. Experiments to test this hypothesis are in progress. In summary, we have shown that the iSH2 domain of p85 mediates binding to p110α, whereas the inhibitory effects of p85 on p110α are largely mediated by an additional constraint imposed by the nSH2 domain. Phosphopeptide occupancy of the nSH2 domain can directly modulate p110α activity. In contrast, modulation of p110α activity by the cSH2 domain occurs by a mechanism that requires residues 1–234 of p85 as well as the nSH2 domain. These studies highlight the complexities of p110α regulation by p85. We thank Dr. Steve Almo for helpful discussions, and Dr. George Orr for discussion and critical reading of the manuscript.

As shown here, the small GTPase RhoA-dependent activation of SRF results in the expression of muscle-specific genes, thereby promoting myogenic differentiation in myoblast cell lines. Co-expression of activated V14-RhoA and SRF results in an approximately 10-fold activation of the skeletal α-actin promoter in replicating myoblasts, while SRFpm1, a dominant negative SRF mutant, blocks RhoA dependent skeletal α-actin promoter activity. Serum withdrawal further potentiates RhoA- and SRF-mediated activation of α-actin promoter to about 30-fold in differentiated myotubes. In addition, the proximal SRE1 in the skeletal α-actin promoter is sufficient to mediate RhoA signaling via SRF. Furthermore, SRFpm1 and to a lesser extent dominant negative N19-RhoA inhibit myoblast fusion, postreplicative myogenic differentiation, and expression of direct SRF targets such as skeletal α-actin and indirect targets such as myogenin and α-myosin heavy chain. Moreover, RhoA also stimulates the autoregulatable murine SRF gene promoter in myoblasts, and the expression level of SRF is reduced in myoblasts overexpressing N19-RhoA.

Serum response factor (SRF),1 a homodimeric DNA-binding protein, is generally presumed to be a ubiquitous transcription factor (1Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R.

SRF is a member of an ancient DNA-binding protein family, whose relatives share a highly conserved DNA-binding/dimerization domain of 90 amino acids, termed the MADS box (3Schwarz-Sommer Z. Huijser Z. Nacken W. Saedler H. Sommer H. Science. 1990; 250: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). SRF acts through binding to a consensus DNA sequence, the serum response element (SRE), which is a 22-bp element of dyad symmetry containing an inner core sequence, CC(A/T)6GG, also known as the CArG box or CBARs (4Greenberg M.E.

These α-striated actins are also among the earliest gene products that mark the commitment of embryonic cell types to cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cell lineages. Paradoxically, how could SRF function as a mediator of intracellular signals leading to cell proliferation when it appears to also have a primary role in mediating expression of muscle-specific genes in postreplicative myocytes?Considerable amounts of evidence support an obligatory role for SRF in regulating muscle gene expression. Like the related MADS box-containingMEF2 genes (11Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), SRF is preferentially expressed in embryonic heart, skeletal, and smooth muscle tissues (12Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A.

We have observed increased SRF gene expression during avian embryogenesis in precardiac splanchnic mesoderm and dorsal somitic mesoderm. SRF protein is also expressed selectively in the myocardium during heart morphogenesis and in the myotomal segment of anterior somites in avian embryos. In fact, the expression levels of SRF in embryonic and adult cardiac tissues are at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than those detected in the liver and other endodermal derived tissues (12Belaguli N.S.

Biol. 1998; 194: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, SRF has been shown to transactivate skeletal α-actin gene transcription under conditions that block myogenic differentiation (16Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Further evidence for its role as a positive regulator of α-actin genes comes from studies in which neutralization of SRF activity by microinjection of SRF antibodies (17Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Carnac G. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or blocking of SRF gene expression through application of SRF antisense oligonucleotides (18Soulez M. Rouviere C.G. Chafey P. Hentzen D. Vandromme M. Lautredou N. Lamb N. Kahn A. Tuil D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6065-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) prevented myogenic dependent gene expression and late stage terminal differentiation in C2 myoblasts. In addition, a dominant negative mutant of SRF, SRFpm1, blocked transcriptional activation of the skeletal α-actin promoter in primary chick myoblast cultures (13Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This SRF mutant, containing triple point mutations within the MADS box, is defective in DNA binding but capable of heterodimerizing with wild type SRF monomere, thereby inhibiting the transcriptional activity of SRF (19Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).We wanted to determine if cell replication- and differentiation-associated signals might differentially regulate SRF-dependent gene activity during myogenesis. Recent studies indicate that at least two distinct signaling pathways can activate SRF-dependent c-fos transcription in response to growth factor stimulation. One pathway requires the ternary complex factor (TCF) (e.g. Elk-1, Sap-1), which contacts an Ets recognition motif adjoining the SRF-binding site on the c-fos promoter (reviewed in Ref. 20Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Activation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling cascade phosphorylates TCF (21Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), causing it to bind to the SRF·SRE complex to form a ternary complex, which in turn activates c-fos gene transcription. Ras regulates the expression of specific genes associated with cellular proliferation and transformation. Ras is also known to inhibit myogenesis in a manner that involves suppression of the expression of key myogenic factors such as MyoD and myogenin (22Konieczny S.F. Drobes B.L. Menke S.L. Taparowsky E.J. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar, 23Olson E.N. Spizz G. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2104-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Via a second pathway, elucidated by Hill et al. (24Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), Rho GTPases activate SRF-dependent but TCF-independent c-fos transcription. Constitutively active RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 activate c-fos transcription by regulating the SRF-SRE interaction directly in the absence of TCF binding. RhoA is involved in many actin-based processes including cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, cytokinesis, and smooth muscle contraction (reviewed in Refs.25Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar and 26Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The ability of RhoA to orchestrate actin filament rearrangement and to regulate SRF transcriptional activity raises the possibility that RhoA might have an important role in cell morphology changes and in- activation of muscle-specific gene expression occurred during muscle differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent report has shown that inhibition of Rho family proteins by the GDP dissociation inhibitor RhoGDI suppresses myogenesis as well as expression of muscle-specific genes in C2C12myoblasts (27Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Concurrently, we also asked whether RhoA signaling was dependent upon SRF during muscle differentiation.In the present study, we found that unlike Ras, which mediates suppression of myogenic gene activity, RhoA strongly activates skeletal α-actin promoter activity in passaged myoblast cell lines. RhoA and an activated V14-RhoA mutant potentiate skeletal α-actin promoter activity in synergy with SRF. Expression of dominant-negative SRFpm1 inhibits RhoA-mediated skeletal α-actin promoter activation. In addition, RhoA signaling through SRF appears to be necessary for myogenic differentiation, since overexpression of SRFpm1 and to a smaller extent N19-RhoA, the dominant-negative RhoA mutant, inhibits the appearance of myogenin and contractile proteins. RhoA also stimulates the autoregulatable murine SRF promoter in myoblasts, and the expression level of SRF is reduced in myoblasts overexpressing N19-RhoA. This study supports the concept that RhoA signaling via SRF is an integral part of a regulatory pathway during muscle terminal differentiation.DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that RhoA is involved in the regulation of the promoter activity of the skeletal α-actin gene, since overexpression of wild type or activated RhoA activates the skeletal α-actin promoter in passaged replicating and differentiating murine myogenic cell lines. In addition, dominant negative RhoA reduces the activity of the skeletal α-actin promoter, and its stable overexpression in myoblasts hinders the formation of myotubes and expression of key muscle-specific proteins including skeletal α-actin, α-MHC, and regulatory factors such as the basic helix-loop-helix factor, myogenin, and SRF. Consistent with a recent report showing that inhibition of Rho family proteins, consisting of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, by the GDP dissociation inhibitor, RhoGDI, suppresses myogenesis including expression of muscle specific genes in C2C12 myoblast (27Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), our results further demonstrate that expression of RhoA potentiates muscle differentiation.The present study provides several lines of evidence for a critical role of SRF in mediating RhoA activation of the skeletal α-actin promoter. RhoA-stimulated α-actin promoter activity is blocked by a dominant negative SRF mutant, SRFpm1, and is potentiated by the addition of wild type SRF. In addition, the proximal SRE1 in the skeletal α-actin promoter is sufficient to mediate the effect of RhoA and SRF. Moreover, RhoA activation of the skeletal α-actin promoter is increased under differentiation condition, which is associated with an increase in SRF expression level. Furthermore, RhoA also activates the SRF promoter, which contains two SRE sequences, thereby regulating levels of SRF transcripts. These observations indicate that RhoA regulates SRF-dependent transcription directly by regulating SRF activity and indirectly by increasing SRF expression.Our study shows that RhoA is involved not only in expression of muscle-specific genes that require direct interaction with SRF on the SREs in their promoter region such as skeletal and cardiac α-actins but also in the expression of myogenin and α-MHC that do not directly bind SRF. Similarly, dominant negative mutant SRFpm1 inhibits both SRE-dependent and SRE-independent muscle-specific gene expressions, supporting a general role of SRF in mediating effects of RhoA in muscle differentiation. The inhibition of the endogenous expression of skeletal and cardiac α-actins by SRFpm1 was consistent with the hypothesis that SRF is an obligatory factor required for muscle-specific expression of the striated α-actin genes. Expression of these genes appears to require direct interaction with SRF on the SREs in the promoter region. SRF is preferentially expressed in embryonic heart, skeletal, and smooth muscle tissues, and increased SRF levels are detected during myogenic differentiation (12Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Browning C.L. Culberson D.E. Aragon I.V. Fillmore R.A. Croissant J.D. Schwartz R.J. Zimmer W.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The increased levels of SRF during myogenesis might saturate multiple SREs in the promoters of muscle-specific genes and displace negative acting factors such as YY1 (16Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Also, multifactor protein complexes may enable SRF to induce the expression of other muscle-specific genes that do not directly bind SRF. Recent experimental evidence has suggested that SRF can physically associate with myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins in vivo and in vitro (33Groisman R. Masutani H. Leibovitch M.P. Robin P. Soudant I. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5258-5264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Association occurred at the respective MADS box and basic helix-loop-helix domains of the protein. The apparent necessity of SRF for expression of α-MHC and myogenin might be due to indirect mechanisms, resulting from the requirement for SRF protein-protein association during the myogenic differentiation process. Our observation that SRF is an important target of RhoA does not rule out the involvement of other transcription factors in mediating myogenic signaling of RhoA. Takano et al. (27Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have suggested that MEF2 could mediate effects of Rho family proteins in muscle differentiation, since expression of MEF2 is inhibited in myoblasts overexpressing RhoGDI. Whether RhoA and/or SRF directly regulate transcriptional activity of MEF2 remains to be determined.In contrast to the well documented Ras-dependent signal pathway leading to SRF activation, the precise mechanism by which RhoA regulates SRF transcriptional activity remains unclear. Rho GTPases are known to be involved in regulation of cytoskeletal organization in response to extracellular signals (34Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar) and also in activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 kinase cascades (35Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 36Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). These two pathways play important roles in the regulation of gene transcription by Rho GTPases. However, in fibroblasts, RhoA-dependent activation of SRF appears to act through other mechanisms (24Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, considerable progress has been made in identifying downstream effector molecules of RhoA. Of particular interest is a family of Rho-activated serine/threonine kinases (Rho kinase and its close relative p160ROCK) (38Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A.

Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). These kinases have been shown to be involved in RhoA-dependent stress fiber formation and focal adhesion formation (39Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25121-25127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have recently reported that constitutively active Rho kinase stimulates the transcriptional activity of c-fos SRE. However, a recent study using RhoA effector loop mutants has shown that signaling to SRF by RhoA does not correlate with binding to any of the effectors tested including Rho kinases (44Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We have recently found that myotonic dystrophy kinase, which has a significant homology to the Rho kinases, enhances the binding of SRF to the skeletal α-actin promoter in vitro and also activates skeletal α-actin transcription via SRF in synergy with RhoA, 2D. Iyer, S. Belaguli, W. Zhou, M. Fluck, B. Rowan, F. W. Booth, N. Weigel, R. J. Schwartz, and A. Balasubramanyam, unpublished results. suggesting that myotonic dystrophy kinase might be a downstream mediator of RhoA in SRF activation.Upstream activators of RhoA include serum, lysophosphatidic acid, thrombin, and bombesin (34Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 45Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 46Rankin S. Morii N. Narumiya S. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which act through cell surface receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins. It is unlikely that either serum or lysophosphatidic acid would initiate RhoA-dependent myogenic signal pathways, since serum withdrawal potentiates RhoA-dependent activation of the skeletal α-actin promoter. One potential signaling pathway interacting with RhoA during muscle differentiation might be through the switching of integrin expression. It has been shown that β1-integrin is required for terminal muscle differentiation (47Menko A.S. Boettiger D. Cell. 1987; 51: 51-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and that expression of β1A and β1D isoforms is developmentally regulated in skeletal muscle and heart, since the muscle-specific β1D isoform appears following myoblast fusion, replacing the common β1A isoform (48Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 49van der Flier A. Kuikman Baudoin C. van der Neut R. Sonnenberg A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, RhoA appears to function both upstream and downstream of integrins in the context of focal adhesion formation and stress fiber assembly (reviewed in Ref.50Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In particular, activated RhoA has been shown to stimulate the activation of focal adhesion kinase, an important mediator of integrin signaling, which links to a number of signaling molecules including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (reviewed in Ref. 51Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays an important role in muscle differentiation (52Kaliman P. Vinals F. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19146-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and is required for insulin-like growth factor-induced muscle differentiation (53Kaliman P. Canicio J. Shepherd P.R. Beeton C.A. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been found to function downstream from RhoA in platelet and Swiss 3T3 cells (54Zhang J. King W.G. Dillon S. Hall A. Feig L. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22251-22254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further study will investigate the possible interactions between signal pathways mediated through RhoA, integrins, focal adhesion kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase during muscle differentiation.While the members of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors have long been regarded as critical regulators of myogenic induction, other factors, such as the MADS box proteins in the MEF2 family, have been shown to play key roles for full myogenic differentiation. A complex network regulated by members of different protein families has been hypothesized to induce the expression of E-box-dependent and -independent genes during myogenesis. The observations that expression of SRFpm1, as shown here, and injection of SRF antibodies into muscle cells (17Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Carnac G. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and SRF antisense oligonucleotides (18Soulez M. Rouviere C.G. Chafey P. Hentzen D. Vandromme M. Lautredou N. Lamb N. Kahn A. Tuil D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6065-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) block myogenic differentiation strongly suggest that SRF is an obligatory regulator of the myogenic process. Given the important role of SRF in the transcriptional regulation of muscle-specific genes and in terminal differentiation (12Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6065-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the present study suggests that the effects of RhoA on myogenic differentiation are mediated in part through its direct effect on SRF transcriptional activity. By virtue of the inhibitory activity of the dominant negative RhoA, which was similar to the myogenic blocking activity of SRFpm1, our study supports the concept that the RhoA signaling pathway via SRF has a central obligatory role in muscle differentiation. Serum response factor (SRF),1 a homodimeric DNA-binding protein, is generally presumed to be a ubiquitous transcription factor (1Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 2Treisman R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2711-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). SRF is a member of an ancient DNA-binding protein family, whose relatives share a highly conserved DNA-binding/dimerization domain of 90 amino acids, termed the MADS box (3Schwarz-Sommer Z. Huijser Z. Nacken W. Saedler H. Sommer H. Science. 1990; 250: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). SRF acts through binding to a consensus DNA sequence, the serum response element (SRE), which is a 22-bp element of dyad symmetry containing an inner core sequence, CC(A/T)6GG, also known as the CArG box or CBARs (4Greenberg M.E.

Functional SREs are found in the promoters of genes involved in the early mitogenic response (4Greenberg M.E. Siegfried Z. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell.

This markedly elevated intracellular folate pool conferred a novel mechanism of resistance to polyglutamatable (e.g. ZD1694, DDATHF, and AG2034) and lipophilic antifolates (e.g. trimetrexate and pyrimethamine) by abolishing their polyglutamylation and circumventing target enzyme inhibition. reduced folate carrier dihydrofolate reductase dihydrofolate 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate 10-formyltetrahydrofolate methotrexate edatrexate trimetrexate N α-(4-amino-4-deoxypteroyl)-N δ-(hemiphtaloyl-l-ornithine) (S)-2(5-(((1, 2-dihydro-3-methyl-1-oxobenzo(f)quinazolin-9-yl)-methyl)-amino) 1-oxo-2-isoindolinyl)-glutaric acid (2S)-2-{O-fluoro-p-[N-(2,7-dimethyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-(prop-2-ynyl)amino] benzamido}-4-(tetrazol-5-yl) butyric acid 5,10-dideza-5,6,7,8,-tetrahydrofolic acid 4-[2-(2-amino-4-oxo-4,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3H-pyrimido[5,4-6]thiazin-6-yl)-(S)-ethyl-2,5-thienoylamino-l-glutamic acid Hepes-buffered saline solution 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyruidine 5′-monophosphate polymerase chain reaction tetrahydrofolate low folate fetal calf serum high performance liquid chromatography.

In contrast and thus far in the human RFC gene, only N-terminal premature translation termination mutations, which disrupt RFC protein expression, were reported (25Gong M. Yess J. Connolly T. Ivy S.P. Ohnuma T. Cowan K.H. Moscow J.A.

Upon growth in low folate (LF) medium, CEM/MTX cells expressed high levels of a structurally altered RFC that is functionally characterized by a 9- and 31-fold increased affinity (decreased K m) for transport of reduced folate cofactors and folic acid, respectively. In folate-replete medium, CEM/MTX-LF cells can accumulate intracellular folates to such a high level that it confers resistance to lipophilic antifolate inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and to some polyglutamatable antifolates due to an abolishment of polyglutamylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsRPMI 1640 medium, with or without folic acid, and (dialyzed) fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

https://openalex.org/W2089440412,"According to a recent hypothesis (Sandhoff, K., and Kolter, T. (1996) Trends Cell Biol. 6, 98-103), glycolipids, which originate from the plasma membrane, are exposed to lysosomal degradation on the surface of intralysosomal vesicles. Taking the interaction of membrane-bound lipid substrates and lysosomal hydrolases as an experimental model, we studied the degradation of glucosylceramides with different acyl chain lengths by purified glucocerebrosidase in a detergent-free liposomal assay system. Our investigation focused on the stimulating effect induced by lysosomal components such as sphingolipid activator protein C (SAP-C or saposin C), anionic lysosomal lipids, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, and dolichol phosphate, as well as degradation products of lysosomal lipids, e.g. dolichols and free fatty acids. The size of the substrate-containing liposomal vesicles was varied in the study. Enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosylceramide carried by liposomes made of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol was rather slow and only weakly accelerated by the addition of SAP-C. However, the incorporation of anionic lipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, dolichol phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol into the substrate carrying liposomes stimulated glucosylceramide hydrolysis up to 30-fold. Dolichol was less effective. SAP-C activated glucosylceramide hydrolysis under a variety of experimental conditions and was especially effective for the increase of enzyme activity when anionic lipids were inserted into the liposomes. Glucosylceramides with short acyl chains were found to be degraded much faster than the natural substrates. Dilution experiments indicated that the added enzyme molecules associate at least partially with the membranes and act there. Surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated binding of SAP-C at concentrations up to 1 microM to liposomes. At higher concentrations (2.5 microM SAP-C), liposomal lipids were released from the liposome coated chip. A model for lysosomal glucosylceramide hydrolysis is discussed."

Reaction of ONOO− with thiols is thought to proceed through formation of a S-nitrothiol (thionitrate; RSNO2) intermediate and yields low levels of S-nitrosothiols (thionitrites; RSNO), both of which are theoretical sources of NO⋅. Kinetic analysis of NO⋅ production after reaction of ONOO− with GSH established that NO⋅ originates exclusively from the thionitrite GSNO. Further mechanistic investigations indicated that GSNO formation by ONOO– does not occur via one-electron oxidation mechanisms. Nitrosation of GSH could theoretically proceed via intermediate formation of the thionitrate GSNO2, which, after rearrangement to the corresponding sulfenyl nitrite (GSONO), can react with GSH to form GSNO and GSOH. However, no evidence for such a mechanism was found in experiments with NO2· or with the stable nitrothiol tert-butylthionitrate. Using high performance liquid chromatography with chemiluminescence detection, formation of H2O2 was observed after reaction of ONOO− with GSH under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, at levels similar to the yield of GSNO, indicative of a direct nucleophilic nitrosation mechanism with elimination of HOO−.

Nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide; NO⋅)1 is produced by many cell types and performs a range of biological functions, including vasodilation, neurotransmission, and modulation of inflammatory processes (1Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5702) Google Scholar). Its unique physical and chemical properties make NO⋅ a versatile messenger molecule with high diffusibility and selected reactivity. Many functions of NO⋅ involve interactions with heme proteins such as guanylyl cyclase, but alternative targets of NO⋅ include other paramagnetic species, such as molecular oxygen (O2), partially reduced oxygen metabolites, and lipid or protein radicals (2Stamler J.S.

An important component of NO⋅biochemistry involves the formation of thionitrite esters with cysteine or cysteine-residues (S-nitrosothiols; RSNO), and low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols orS-nitrosothiol adducts in proteins such as albumin or hemoglobin are known to be generated in vivo (4Stamler J.S.

Formation of S-nitrosothiols may provide a buffering system regulating the bioavailability of NO⋅ and/or serve to increase its range of action, since S-nitrosothiols are more stable and can release NO⋅ by site-specific regulatory mechanisms, via reactions with transition metal ions or other reducing systems such as thioredoxin or superoxide anion (7Butler A.R.

Despite the growing interest in the role of S-nitrosothiols in the biological actions of NO⋅, there is still uncertainty regarding the mechanism of S-nitrosation in vivo, which most likely does not involve direct reaction of NO⋅ with thiols but requires electrophilic activation to a nitrosyl cation (NO+)-like intermediate. Metabolites formed during NO⋅ (auto)oxidation, such as dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), are likely candidates in this respect (14Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W.

Alternatively, NO⋅ can be activated to intermediates with NO+ character via interaction with ferric heme proteins (18Wade R.S. Castro C.E. Chem. Res.

The potential physiological significance of this chemistry is supported by several recent investigations that have implicated NO⋅ synthases, under certain conditions, in the production of NO⋅ and O⨪2 simultaneously and hence in the generation of ONOO− rather than NO⋅ (25Mayer B.

Moreover, activation of guanylyl cyclase by either purified NO⋅ synthase or by ONOO− is in both cases promoted by the presence of thiols and involves the intermediate formation of S-nitrosothiols (25Mayer B.

Although kinetic studies suggest that most of the generated ONOO− will react primarily with CO2 or with metalloproteins (32Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), thiols represent significant direct targets for ONOO−, especially intracellularly, where the total thiol concentration may exceed 10 mm (33Radi R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 354-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical investigations of the reaction of ONOO− with thiols have revealed both one- and two-electron oxidation pathways (20Radi R.

Thiols and other nucleophilic substrates are thought to react with ONOO− primarily via nucleophilic substitution at the weak peroxide bond with elimination of nitrite (20Radi R. Beckman J.S.

A, 3722–3725Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism of thiol oxidation by ONOO− is presumed to involve an electron transfer mechanism with intermediate formation of thionitrate esters (S-nitrothiols; RSNO2) (21Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar, 37Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wu M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1038-H1043PubMed Google Scholar, 38Zhang H.

Thionitrate esters decompose in aqueous systems to release NO⋅ via homolytic cleavage of a sulfenyl nitrite (RSONO) intermediate, formed by intramolecular rearrangement of RSNO2 (39Feelisch M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1991; 17 Suppl. 3: 25-33Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 40Cameron D.R. Borrajo A.M.P. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Can. J.

Hence, reaction of ONOO− with thiols to generate NO⋅ may involve the intermediation of S-nitrosothiols,S-nitrothiols, or both. Moreover, since ONOO−is considered unable to directly nitrosate substrates (21Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F.

The present study was undertaken to unravel the reaction mechanisms involved in NO⋅formation after reaction of ONOO− with thiols and establishes that the NO⋅ formed in such reactions originates exclusively from S-nitrosothiol intermediates, which are formed by direct nucleophilic substitution with elimination of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Our results indicate that ONOO− may contribute significantly to formation of S-nitrosothiols in vivo and that direct nitrosation of nucleophilic targets by ONOO− may play an important role in NO⋅-dependent biochemical processes.

Peroxynitrite (ONOO−) was prepared by reaction of H2O2 with nitrous acid (HNO2) in a quenched flow reactor, passed over a short (3 × 0.5-cm) column filled with manganese dioxide to remove residual H2O2, and quantitated spectrophotometrically (ε302 = 1,670 m−1cm−1; Ref. 43Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). For control experiments, ONOO− stock solutions were kept at room temperature overnight to allow complete decomposition to nitrite and/or nitrate.S-Nitroso-l-cysteine (CysNO) was synthesized by mixing 100 mm NaNO2 in 500 mm HCl with 100 mm Cys. tert-Butyl thionitrate (tBuSNO2) was synthesized as outlined by Oae et al. (44Oae S. Shinhama K. Fujimori K. Kim Y.H. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1980; 53: 775-784Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 g of dinitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4; Matheson, Secaucus, NJ) in 135 ml of carbon tetrachloride was added slowly to 62 g of 2-methyl-2-propane thiol in 500 ml of diethylether, while keeping the reaction mixture on dry ice/acetone. After completion of the reaction, solvents were removed by evaporation, and the thionitrate was purified by vacuum distillation. The resulting tert-butyl thionitrate was >95% pure as determined by UV spectroscopy and NMR analysis and did not contain detectable levels of the corresponding thionitrite (44Oae S. Shinhama K. Fujimori K. Kim Y.H. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1980; 53: 775-784Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Caution: Dinitrogen tetraoxide is a yellowish brown liquid that evaporates rapidly to the highly toxic gas nitrogen dioxide, and may present a serious inhalation hazard if not handled properly). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and obtained from commercial sources. GSH or other thiols were dissolved in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) that was treated overnight with Dowex chelating resin to remove contaminating transition metal ions, and reactions were carried out at room temperature either within a 2-ml reaction vessel attached to the NO⋅ chemiluminescence analyzer (Antek Instruments, Houston, TX) under continuous stirring or in borosilicate glass tubes. Small volumes (<15 μl) of ONOO− stock solutions were injected into the reaction mixture through a septum using a Hamilton syringe, and production of NO⋅ was monitored continuously. The addition of alkaline solutions of ONOO− did not change the pH of the buffer by more than 0.1 pH unit. Similar experiments were performed in freshly obtained human blood plasma obtained after centrifugation of venous blood for 10 min at 750 × g. For HPLC analysis of GSH, Cys, or S-nitrosothiols (see below), plasma was filtrated at 15,000 × g on Microcon-3 filtration units (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). In additional experiments, GSH or other thiols were reacted with the nitrating agent TNM by the addition of 1–20 μl of a 100 mm stock solution in ethanol to a 1-ml reaction mixture under rapid vortexing. Similarly, GSH was reacted with small aliquots of tBuSNO2 (added from a freshly prepared 50 mmstock solution in CH3CN) or reacted in the presence of 100 μm NO2−, 10 nm myeloperoxidase, and glucose/glucose oxidase to continuously generate H2O2 (e.g.Ref. 45van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Alternatively, solutions (10 ml) of GSH were exposed to 250 ppm NO2· in N2, which was bubbled through the solutions for up to 30 min. In order to more closely mimic conditions under which ONOO− is produced in vivo, solutions of 2 mm GSH in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were incubated in the presence of continuous fluxes of NO⋅ and/or O⨪2, at 37 °C. Continuous exposure to NO⋅ was achieved by incubation with 45 μm of the NO⋅ donor spermine NONOate, which decomposes at neutral pH (t½ = 50 min at 22 °C, pH 7.4) to continuously release NO⋅ at 1 μm/min. Formation of NO⋅was quantitated by following spermine NONOate decomposition spectrophotometrically (ε250 = 8,000m−1 cm−1; Ref. 46Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Generation of O⨪2 was achieved using 100 μm xanthine and xanthine oxidase (1–4 milliunits/ml), and production of O⨪2was determined spectrophotometrically via ferricytochrome creduction (47McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At various times during or after these various reactions, reaction mixtures were analyzed for remaining GSH or generated NO2−, GSNO, or H2O2 using the various procedures outlined below. NO⋅ was measured by ozone-induced chemiluminescence using an Antek model 7020 chemiluminescence detector (Antek Instruments, Houston, TX). Formation of NO⋅ in solution was monitored by continuous extraction through microporous polypropylene fibers, through which a flow of helium carrier gas was passed to sweep NO⋅ into the chemiluminescence detector (48Beckman J.S. Conger K.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 35-39Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This procedure allows for continuous measurement of NO⋅ production before autoxidation or evaporation occurs and enables kinetic measurement of NO⋅ formation in solution. The chemiluminescence response to NO2· was less than 0.5% compared with NO⋅, and injection of pure N2O did not give a signal above that of room air, suggesting that this detector is specific for NO⋅. The rate of NO⋅ production in solution was calibrated using spermine NONOate, decomposition of which was quantitated spectrophotometrically (ε250 = 8,000m−1 cm−1; Ref. 46Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Injection of spermine NONOate (0.5–100 μm) into 100 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) within the reaction vessel of the NO⋅analyzer resulted in a NO⋅ signal that reached a plateau within several minutes, reflecting a steady-state situation in which the rate of NO⋅ formation equals the rate of withdrawal of NO⋅from the solution. A linear calibration curve was obtained by plotting the obtained plateau height against the spectrophotometrically determined rate of NO⋅ release, over a range of 1 nm/min (detection limit) to 1 μm/min. A similar calibration curve could also be obtained using the NO⋅donor PAPA NONOate (t½ = 30 min, 22 °C, pH 7.4), although the plateau decreased faster due to faster decomposition of PAPA NONOate compared with spermine NONOate. Formation of NO2− and NO3− was determined by chemiluminescence after reduction to NO⋅ with V(III) as described (49Braman R.S. Hendrix S.A. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 2715-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) (Antek Instruments) or via spectrophotometric analysis after the acid-catalyzed diazotation reaction with sulfanylamide and naphtylethylenediamine (Griess reaction). GSNO and CysNO were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using a 250 × 4.6-mm 5-μm RP-18 Spherisorb ODS-2 column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) with 50 mmKH2PO4 (pH 3.0), containing 1% acetonitrile as an eluant at 1 ml/min and UV detection at 340 nm (e.g. Ref.23Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P. Koesling D. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The identity of GSNO and CysNO was confirmed by coelution with authentic standards and by spectral matching using a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. GSNO and CysNO were quantitated using external standards with a detection limit of approximately 10 pmol. Reduced thiols in plasma or proteins were measured by spectrophotometric detection at 412 nm after reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (ε = 13, 600 m−1 cm−1). GSH and other low molecular mass thiols were analyzed by HPLC after derivatization with monobromobimane (50Newton G.L. Dorian R. Fahey R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated with 2 mm monobromobimane in the dark for 5 min, and derivatized samples were injected on a 10-μm Bondapak RP-18 RadialPak column (Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted with 8% acetonitrile in 0.25% acetic acid at 1 ml/min. Derivatized thiols were analyzed by fluorescence detection (excitation, 394 nm; emission, 480 nm) and quantitated using external standards of similarly derivatized GSH or Cys, with a detection limit of about 1 pmol. After elution of the derivatized thiols, the mobile phase was switched to 75% acetonitrile in water for 5 min to remove underivatized and/or hydrolyzed monobromobimane followed by a 5-min reequilibration with the initial mobile phase (total run time, 20 min). Production of H2O2 was assayed by HPLC and chemiluminescence detection after postcolumn reaction with microperoxidase and isoluminol (51Yamamoto Y. Brodsky M.H. Baker J.C. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures were diluted 20-fold in MeOH and injected on a 250 × 4.6-mm Supercosil LC-NH2 column (Supelco, Bellafonte, PA) using MeOH, 40 mm NaH2PO4 (95:5, v/v) as eluant at 1 ml/min. The eluant was mixed with an equal flow of a mixture of 8 mg/liter microperoxidase and 1 mm isoluminol in MeOH, 10 mm Na2B4O7 (pH 10) (70:30, v/v). H2O2 eluted at 3.6 min and was quantitated by comparison with external standards, the concentration of which was determined spectrophotometrically (ε240 = 43.6m–1 cm–1), with an on-column detection limit of about 1 pmol. Spectrometric assays for H2O2 based on either peroxidase reactions or on Fe(II) oxidation and complexation with SCN− were unsuitable for this purpose because of interfering reactions of NO2− (e.g. Ref. 45van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In agreement with earlier observations (22Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Goodwin D.A. Read N.G. Zamora-Pino R. Feelisch M. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6702-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 23Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P. Koesling D. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), injection of ONOO− (0.1–1.0 mm final concentration) into buffer solutions containing 2 mm GSH within the reaction vessel of the chemiluminescence analyzer resulted in production of NO⋅. A similar injection of aqueous stock solutions of NO⋅ (10–100 μm) generated an almost instantaneous NO⋅ signal that decayed exponentially within several minutes (e.g. Ref. 48Beckman J.S. Conger K.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 35-39Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, the onset of NO⋅production after reaction of ONOO− with GSH was relatively slow, starting well after all ONOO− had reacted or decomposed, and NO⋅ production gradually reached a plateau reflecting steady-state NO⋅ generation that persisted for over 30 min (Fig. 1 A). Thus, reaction of ONOO− with GSH generates a product that slowly decomposes to release NO⋅. No NO⋅ formation was detected when ONOO− was decomposed prior to the addition to GSH, and no detectable NO⋅ formation was observed whenS-methyl-GSH was used instead of GSH, indicating that the NO⋅ donor is produced via reaction of ONOO− with the free sulfhydryl group of GSH. HPLC analysis revealed formation of low levels of GSNO upon reaction of ONOO− with GSH, which could be detected immediately (<1 min) after the addition of ONOO−. Formation of GSNO increased linearly with the concentration of ONOO− added unless ONOO– was added in relative excess of GSH (Fig. 1 B), in which case GSH was completely oxidized and no GSNO was detected. The steady-state rate of NO⋅ release after reaction of ONOO– with GSH correlated closely with the formation of GSNO (Fig. 1 B). The addition of ONOO− in relative excess over GSH only resulted in formation of a small transient NO⋅ signal (Fig. 1 A, trace 3), most likely reflecting NO⋅ production during decomposition of ONOO−. Hence, our results indicate that the sustained NO⋅ release observed after reaction of ONOO− with GSH originates from GSNO and requires the presence of excess GSH. Accordingly, solutions of GSNO (5–20 μm) in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) did not generate detectable amounts of NO⋅ unless GSH was added, in which case sustained formation of NO⋅ was observed with kinetics similar to that observed after reaction of ONOO− with GSH. Although GSH promoted NO⋅ release from GSNO, high concentrations of GSH (>2 mm) reduced NO⋅ generation from authentic GSNO and similarly attenuated NO⋅ generation after reaction with 0.5 mm ONOO− (Fig. 1 C), although GSNO formation was slightly enhanced (Fig. 1 C, inset). This close parallel between NO⋅ production from GSNO and from ON"

Phosphorylation of a positionally conserved tyrosine residue is obligatory for Stat dimerization, nuclear translocation, and specific DNA binding. Studies of Stat1 and Stat3 have suggested that serine phosphorylation may also regulate function. We now identify serine residues located in a conserved PSP motif of Stat5a (Ser725) and Stat5b (Ser730) as major phosphorylation sites, using mutagenesis, phosphoamino acid analysis, and site-specific anti-Stat5-phosphoserine antibodies. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation control of this PSP motif differed between the highly homologous Stat5a and Stat5b proteins. Whereas Ser725 of Stat5a was constitutively phosphorylated both in COS-7 cells and Nb2 lymphocytes, phosphorylation of Ser730of Stat5b was markedly stimulated by prolactin. The data also suggested the existence of a second major serine phosphorylation site in Stat5a. Interestingly, constitutive phosphorylation of the PSP motif was suppressed by PD98059 but not by staurosporine under conditions in which both agents inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with staurosporine, PD98059, H7, or wortmannin did not prevent either Stat5a or Stat5b from becoming maximally serine-phosphorylated after prolactin exposure. We propose that two pathways regulate Stat5 serine phosphorylation, one that is prolactin-activated and PD98059-resistant and one that is constitutively active and PD98059-sensitive and preferentially targets Stat5a. Finally, phosphorylation of the PSP motif of Stat5a or Stat5b was not essential for DNA binding or transcriptional activation of a β-casein reporter gene in COS-7 cells, suggesting that serine kinase control of Stat5 activity differs from that of Stat1 and Stat3.

Although information on the involvement of Stat proteins in the etiology and progression of disease is still limited, fundamental knowledge of the function and regulation of Stat proteins is expected to have important clinical and pharmaceutical significance. There are currently seven known Stat genes (2Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Among these, Stat1 and Stat2 are important for the antiproliferative and antiviral effects of interferons, whereas Stat3 regulates acute phase response genes (2Ihle J.N.

Specifically, serine residue 727 constitutes a major phosphorylation site in Stat1α and Stat3 and is important for interferon-induced nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and maximal transcriptional activation (16Zhang X.

Stat5 transcription factors lack the conserved PMSP motif of Stat1 and Stat3. However, serine residues Ser725 of Stat5a and Ser730 of Stat5b are candidate phosphorylation sites because they are located within a positionally homologous PSP motif. In contrast to Stat1 and Stat3, Stat5 proteins do not appear to be substrates of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (27Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. DaSilva L. Erwin R.A. Liu X.

To identify serine phosphorylation sites of Stat5 transcription factors, a series of serine mutants of Stat5a and Stat5b were analyzed using a COS-7 cell reconstitution system. COS-7 cells do not express detectable levels of prolactin receptors, Stat5a, or Stat5b and have been used for studies of prolactin receptor-mediated β-casein gene regulation by several laboratories (30Gouilleux F.

We now report that the proline-juxtaposed serine residues Ser725 of Stat5a and Ser730 of Stat5b are major phosphorylation sites, based on phosphoamino acid analysis and the generation of site-directed anti-Stat5-phosphoserine antibodies. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation control of this PSP motif differed between the highly homologous Stat5a and Stat5b proteins, and phosphoamino acid analysis suggested the existence of a second major serine phosphorylation site unique to Stat5a. The data also indicated that two distinct pathways lead to serine phosphorylation of the PSP motif of Stat5, one PD98059-resistant, prolactin-activated pathway, and one PD98059-sensitive, constitutive pathway. Because phosphorylation of the PSP motif of Stat5a or Stat5b was not essential for DNA binding or transcriptional activation of a β-casein reporter gene in COS-7 cells, it is possible that regulation of Stat5 activity by serine kinases differs from that of Stat1 and Stat3. Expression vectors for mouse Stat5a (pXM-Stat5a) and mouse Stat5b (pXM-Stat5b) were kindly provided by Xiuwen Liu and Lothar Hennighausen (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (31Liu X.

The (−344 to −1) β-casein gene promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (pZZ1; kindly provided by Bernd Groner, Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Freiburg, Germany) and the plasmid pCH110 containing the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the simian virus 40 promoter have been described previously (30Gouilleux F.

Kelly, Intitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Paris, France) was constructed by cloning into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Mutants of Stat5a and Stat5b were prepared from double-stranded DNAs using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with oligonucleotide primers designed to alter serine residues to alanines or tyrosines to phenylalanines. The following mutants of mouse Stat5a were generated by this method: S710A (TCC to GCC), S725A (TCC to GCC), and Y694F (TAC to TTC). These mutants of Stat5b were also made: S35A (TCA to GCA), S45A (TCA to GCA), S132A (AGT to GCT), S427A (TCT to GCT), S715A (TCC to GCC), S730A (TCC to GCC), S748A (TCC to GCC), Y679F (TAT to TTT), and Y699F (TAC to TTC). Before use, the DNA sequence of each mutant was verified. COS-7 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfections were done by the DEAE-dextran method using subconfluent COS-7 cells in 100-mm dishes. Two micrograms of the prolactin receptor construct (p3PRLR), 2 μg of one of the plasmids pXM-Stat5a or pXM-Stat5b, or mutants of pXM-Stat5a or pXM-Stat5b, were used in each transfection. For luciferase and β-galactosidase assays, 2 μg of pZZ1 and 0.2 μg of pCH110 encoding the β-galactosidase gene were added. One day after transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 nm human prolactin (NIDDK-hPRL-SIAFP-B2, AFP-2969A), which was supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Nb2 cell line was originally established by Dr. Peter Gout (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada), and the Nb2-SP clone used in this work was kindly provided by Dr. Henry Friesen (University of Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, catalog number 15-040-LM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Nb2 cells at a density of 1–1.5 × 106/ml were incubated for 20–24 h in lactogen-free medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium that instead of 10% fetal calf serum contained 1% gelded horse serum (Sigma, catalog number H-1895). Cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min with various inhibitors before stimulation with 100 nmovine prolactin (NIDDK-oPRL-19, AFP-9221A) for 15 min. Cell pellets were frozen at −70 °C. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin as described (26Kirken R.A.

For immunoprecipitation from clarified cell lysates, polyclonal rabbit antisera (2 μl/ml) specific to peptides corresponding to the unique COOH termini of Stat5a or Stat5b were used (27Kirken R.A.

Transfected COS-7 cells were metabolically labeled with 0.75 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h at 37 °C, stimulated with 10 nm human prolactin for 30 min, and then lysed and immunoprecipitated as described above. Proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads, separated on SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography and analyzed by phosphoamino acid analysis as described earlier (33Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5364-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bands corresponding to Stat5a or Stat5b proteins were excised and exposed to limited hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 60 min. Samples were then dried, resuspended in water with phosphoamino acid standards, and spotted onto a thin layer cellulose acetate gel. One-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis was performed at 1500 V for 40 min in buffer containing pyridine:acetic acid:water at a 10:100:1890 ratio. Standards were visualized with ninhydrin, and samples were analyzed by autoradiography. The phosphopeptide DQAP[pS]PAVC corresponding to amino acid residues 721–729 of human Stat5a or 726–734 of human Stat5b was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used as an immunogen in rabbits (Genosys Inc., Woodlands, TX). The antiserum was first precleared by passing over a resin of immobilized, unphosphorylated peptide, followed by affinity purification against immobilized, phosphorylated peptide. For immunoblotting, blots were incubated for 16 h with antibodies at a concentration corresponding to 1:3000 dilution of original serum. Cells were treated with or without 10 nm human prolactin as indicated, pelleted by centrifugation, and immediately solubilized in electrophoretic mobility shift assay lysis buffer and analyzed as described earlier (26Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. Liu X. Farrar W.L. Hennighausen L. Larner A.C. Grimley P.M. Rui H. J. Biol.

Polyacrylamide gels (4%) containing 5% glycerol and 0.25 × Tris borate/EDTA were prerun in 0.25 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4–10 °C for 1.5 h at 300 V. After loading of samples, the gels were run at room temperature for ∼3 h at 250 V. Gels were dried by heating under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.). One day after transfection, COS-7 cells were stimulated with prolactin for 16 h and harvested. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in Triton/glycylglycine lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mmglycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. For luciferase assays, 100 μl of cell lysate were mixed with 360 μl of assay buffer containing 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 15 mmMgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity of each sample was determined by measuring luminescence after injection of 200 μl of 1 mm luciferine. Assays for β-galactosidase were carried out using Galacto-Light Plus (Tropix, Inc.). Two hundred microliters of reaction buffer were added to 20 μl of cell lysate and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Measurements were made by injecting 200 μl of light emission accelerator II (Tropix, Inc.), and each sample was counted for 5 s. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies, luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase values in each individual sample. Sequence alignments of various Stat proteins in the region corresponding to the phosphorylated serine Ser727 of Stat1 and Stat3 showed that whereas Stat1, Stat3, and Stat4 have the classical MAPK phosphorylation site PXSP (21Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Stat5a and Stat5b contain instead a conserved PSP motif (Fig. 1 A). A previous alignment based solely on the sheep Stat5 sequence did not recognize this difference (17Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Peptide phosphorylation studies have suggested that PSP motifs are less efficient phosphoacceptors for ERKs than PXSP motifs (21Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore of particular relevance to determine whether Stat5 PSP motifs were phosphorylation sites. To specifically analyze the involvement of the PSP serine residues of Stat5a and Stat5b, mutants Stat5a-S725A and Stat5b-S730A were generated (Fig. 1 B). In addition, mutants Stat5a-S710A and Stat5b-S715A were also made based on the conserved nature and proximity of these serine residues to the dimerization and trans-activation domains (Fig. 1 B). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for the prolactin receptor and wild-type or mutant forms of Stat5a or Stat5b proteins. Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with or without 10 nm prolactin for 30 min. Stat5a or Stat5b proteins were immunoprecipitated from corresponding cell lysates, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 2, A and B, upper panels). The isolated Stat5a or Stat5b proteins were then excised and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis after limited acid hydrolysis (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panels). Wild-type Stat5a showed significantly higher levels of constitutive phosphorylation than wild-type Stat5b when expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, A and B, upper panels). This constitutive phosphorylation of Stat5a was selective for serine residues (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). The extent of inducible serine phosphorylation was therefore much less pronounced in Stat5a than in Stat5b, whereas inducible tyrosine phosphorylation levels were comparable. The effect of mutation of Ser730 on Stat5b serine phosphorylation was dramatic, because inducible phosphoserine levels were reduced almost to background levels in mutant Stat5b-S730A (Fig. 2 B). This analysis provided the first evidence that Ser730 is the predominant serine phosphorylation site of Stat5b. Furthermore, substitution of S715 of Stat5b with alanine led to constitutively elevated phosphoserine levels of mutant Stat5b-S715A (Fig. 2 B). However, this hyperphosphorylated state did not prevent mutant Stat5b-S715A from becoming inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to prolactin. To address whether Ser730 was the hyperphosphorylated residue in the Stat5b-S715A mutant, we converted Ser730 of this mutant to alanine and generated the double mutant Stat5b-S715A,S730A. This co-mutation completely abolished the constitutive phosphorylation and reduced inducible serine phosphorylation to the low levels observed in the Stat5b-S730A mutant (Fig. 2 B). This result was consistent with Ser730 as the hyperphosphorylated site of Stat5b-S715A and supported the notion that Ser730 is a predominant serine phosphorylation site of Stat5b. Furthermore, although of unknown significance, stoichiometrically low levels of phosphothreonine were also induced in Stat5b but not in Stat5a. The corresponding phosphoamino acid analysis of the Stat5a-S725A mutant showed high constitutive phosphoserine levels, which suggested the existence of an additional site distinct from Ser725 in Stat5a (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). However, a significant and consistent reduction in phosphoserine content of Stat5a-S725A compared with wild-type Stat5a indicated that Ser725 of Stat5a was also a phosphorylation site. No changes in phosphorylation were observed in mutant Stat5a-S710A, in contrast to the increased levels of constitutive serine phosphorylation in the matching Stat5b-S715A mutant. Finally, no constitutive or inducible phosphotyrosine could be detected in mutants Stat5a-Y694F and Stat5b-Y699F (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with the key regulatory role of these positionally conserved tyrosine residues (30Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). On the other hand, both tyrosine mutants were constitutively phosphorylated on serine, showing that serine phosphorylation of both Stat5a and Stat5b can occur independently of tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, we conclude from these phosphoamino acid analyses that Ser730 of Stat5b is a predominant and inducible phosphorylation site, and that the corresponding Ser725 of Stat5a was constitutively phosphorylated. Finally, phosphoamino acid analysis suggested that a second phosphoserine site existed in Stat5a. To directly establish whether the PSP motif is phosphorylated in both Stat5a and Stat5b, we generated site-specific anti-Stat5-phosphoserine antibodies using a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to this shared motif. Consistent with marked constitutive phosphorylation of Ser725 of wild-type Stat5a, these antibodies showed strong reaction to wild-type Stat5a but not mutant Stat5a-S725A or the double mutant Stat5a-S710A,S725A (Fig. 3 A, middle panel). Constitutive serine phosphorylation of Ser725 was also verified in mutants Stat5a-S710A and Stat5a-Y694F. Examination of Stat5b mutants with the same antiphosphoserine antibodies gave a similar pattern, except that basal phosphorylation of Ser730 was much lower and was inducible by prolactin, consistent with phosphoamino acid data. No immunoreaction toward proteins carrying the Stat5a-S725A or Stat5b-S730A mutations was observed, attesting to the specificity of the anti-Stat5-phosphoserine antibodies. Parallel examination of tyrosine phosphorylation states of Stat5 proteins in prolactin-treated COS-7 cells by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting also corroborated the phosphoamino acid analyses and showed that Stat5 wild-type proteins and the various Ser-to-Ala mutants were tyrosine-phosphorylated equally well in response to prolactin stimulation (Fig. 3, A and B, upper panels). Similarly, immunoblotting confirmed that mutants Stat5a-Y694F and Stat5b-Y699F did not become tyrosine-phosphorylated on additional sites. Immunoblotting also verified that each of the mutants was expressed at comparable levels in COS-7 cells. We conclude from these experiments that the PSP motif is a major serine phosphorylation site in both Stat5a and Stat5b. The ability of wild-type proteins and mutants Stat5a-S725A and Stat5b-S730A to bind to an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the prolactin response element of the β-casein gene promoter was evaluated (Fig. 4, A and B). Using prolactin-responsive COS-7 cells, mutants Stat5a-S725A and Stat5b-S730A were found to be fully capable of forming DNA comple"

Silencing is due to a family of recently described nuclear corepressor proteins (NCoR and SMRT) which bind to the CoR box in the hinge region of TR. Ligand-dependent activation of TR is associated with displacement of corepressors and recruitment of coactivating proteins. Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is due to mutations in the β isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR-β). To date, three RTH mutations reportedly with near-normal T3binding (A234T, R243Q, and R243W) have been described in or near the CoR box. To determine the mechanism of RTH caused by these mutants, the interaction of wild type (wt) and mutant TRs with the corepressor, NCoR, and the coactivator, SRC-1, was tested in gel-shift assays. As expected, NCoR bound wt TR in the absence of T3 and dissociated from TR with increasing T3 concentration. SRC-1 failed to bind wt TR in the absence of T3, but bound to TR with increasing avidity as T3 concentrations rose. At no T3 concentration did both NCoR and SRC-1 bind to wt TR, indicating that their binding to TR was mutually exclusive. Hinge mutants bound NCoR normally in the absence of T3; however, dissociation of NCoR and recruitment of SRC-1 was markedly impaired except at very high T3 concentrations. Importantly, hinge mutant TRs when complexed to DNA bound T3 poorly despite their near-normal T3 binding in solution. These binding studies correlated with functional assays showing defective transactivation of pTREs by hinge mutants except at high T3concentrations. Thus, we describe a novel mechanism of RTH whereby TR hinge mutants selectively affect T3 binding when complexed to DNA, and prevent NCoR dissociation from TR. Our data also suggest that solution T3 binding by RTH mutants may not accurately reflect physiologically relevant T3 binding by TR when bound to DNA.

Individuals with the disorder require greater thyroid hormone (T3) concentrations in order to achieve T3-dependent actions in tissues. RTH is a dominant disorder in which most individuals are heterozygous for a mutant TR-β allele.

RTH mutations congregate in two major “hot spots” in the ligand binding domain of TR-β (38Parrilla R. Mixson A.J. McPherson J.A. McClaskey J.H. Weintraub B.D. J. Clin.

Recently, mutations have also been reported in the hinge region, suggesting a third hot spot for mutations within the TR-β locus (41Adams M. Matthews C. Collingwood T.N. Tone Y. Beck-Peccoz P. Chatterjee V.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 42Onigata K. Yagi H. Sakuri A. Nagashima T. Nomura Y. Nagashima K. Hashizume K. Morikawa A.

Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar) of TR: A234T, R243Q, R243W, V264D, T277A, and R282S (40Behr M. Loos U. Mol.

Based on the location of corepressor binding, RTH mutations in or near the CoR box might be expected to alter corepressor binding and affect TR function. While the A234T mutation is reported to have mildly decreased T3binding, R243Q and R243W are reported to bind T3 normally in solution (40Behr M. Loos U. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1119-1126PubMed Google Scholar, 42Onigata K. Yagi H. Sakuri A. Nagashima T. Nomura Y. Nagashima K. Hashizume K. Morikawa A.

Because A234T, R243Q, and R243W bind T3 normally or near normally in solution, we decided to investigate the mechanism by which they cause RTH. Site-directed mutagenesis (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to create hinge mutations in the context of the human TR-β1 isoform (45Weinberger C. Thompson C.C. Ong E.S. Lebo R. Gruol D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1986; 324: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the TR-β1 C terminus. The expression vector used for transfections in this study was pSG5, containing either wild type (wt) or mutant TR-β cDNAs as EcoRI fragments. The human TR-β1 cDNA was used as the wt TR-β1. Expression vector plasmid preparations used in this study were carefully quantitated by agarose gel electrophoresis. To confirm the integrity and quality of each expression vector plasmid DNA preparation, in vitrotranslation with [35S]methionine was performed using T7 polymerase and the products analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The SRC-1 nuclear binding domain (NBD-1) fragment was generated by polymerase chain reaction of amino acids 594–780 of an F-SRC-1 clone generously provided by William W. Chin. The generation of the binding domain of NCoR, NCoR-I, has been previously described (9Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reporter constructs included two copies of idealized pTREs, direct repeat with a four-base pair interval (DR+4) (41Adams M. Matthews C. Collingwood T.N. Tone Y. Beck-Peccoz P. Chatterjee V.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and inverted palindrome (chicken lysozyme F2) (46Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Kohne A.C. Renkawitz R. Cell. 1990; 61: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Constructs contained the pTRE element fused upstream of a −109 thymidine kinase promoter and the luciferase gene to measure activity. The luciferase reporter gene was derived from pA3 and contained two transcriptional stop sequences upstream of the promoter to prevent read-through transcription. The reporter was documented to have no positive thyroid hormone response in the absence of response elements. Transfections were performed in CV-1 cells which are relatively TR-deficient (47Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M.

Cell cultures were transfected using a calcium-phosphate precipitation method and precipitate applied for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and appropriate antimicrobials. The next day, media was removed and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing both anion exchange and charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (10%) was added ± T3. Concentrations of T3 were used as noted. Data were pooled from at least three independent experiments and displayed as mean ± S.E. Gel-shift studies were performed using constructs of the wt and mutant TRs placed in a pGEM vector. To study corepressor binding, a construct was fashioned inserting the TR interacting domains of NCoR (9Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) into the pKCR2 expression vector. TRs and the binding domain of NCoR werein vitro translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). The nuclear binding domain (NBD-1) of SRC-1 (21Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S.

Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into a procaryote glutationineS-transferase (GST) expression vector resulting in a GST fusion protein. TR-SRC interactions were evaluated accordingly. A polyclonal anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) which specifically disrupted the TR/SRC·GST complex was used to more clearly identify TR-SRC-1 binding. The binding affinities for wt and mutant TRs in solution were assessed with a filter binding assay utilizing 125I-labeled T3 (50Inoue A. Yamakawa J. Yukioka M. Morisawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). K a values were assigned after Scatchard analysis. T3 binding on DNA was also assessed following a standard gel-shift protocol except that125I-labeled T3 replaced32P-labeled DR+4 for visualization. As shown in Fig. 1, three TR-β mutations were evaluated in this study (A234T, R243Q, and R243W). These mutations were introduced into a TR-β1 cDNA in pGEM 3, using site-directed mutagenesis and transferred to the expression vector pSG5 for use in transient transfection studies. Mutant TR binding to T3 in solution (Table I) is not significantly impaired with each mutant displaying only a 20–40% reduction in T3 binding. These results confirm those of other laboratories studying the T3 binding properties of these mutant receptors (40Behr M. Loos U. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Shown are the K a values of the three tested hinge mutant TRs relative to wt TR. We first evaluated mutant TR binding to the nuclear corepressor, NCoR, using a gel-shift assay. The three hinge mutants noted above (A234T, R243Q, and R243W), a severe GRTH mutant (Δ337T) (51Baniahmad A. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A portion of NCoR, containing the TR interacting domains but lacking the repressing domains, termed NCoR-I, was employed in the assay (9Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In vitro translated TRs formed a dimer (D) in the absence of NCoR-I on a DR+4 radiolabeled element. Addition of in vitrotranslated NCoR-I caused the dimer to be shifted to a new position and serial dilution of the amount of NCoR-I added to the binding reaction reduced the intensity of this complex. Ligand-independent binding of NCoR-I to each of the mutants was similar to wt TR (Fig. 2). Addition of RXR-α or RXR-β to the binding reaction resulted in the formation of a strong heterodimeric complex, and a significant reduction in the TR·NCoR-I complex (data not shown). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 3, T3 dissociation of NCoR-I from certain mutant TRs was much different than from wt TR on the DR+4 element. With wt TR, 5 nm T3 resulted in an almost complete dissociation of the TR/NCoR-I complex (panel A). The artificial hinge mutant with normal T3 binding, E220R (panel B), had a similar NCoR-I dissociation pattern. The A234T mutant (panel C), however, required about 2-fold higher concentration of T3 to dissociate NCoR-I than did wt TR. The R243Q and R243W mutants (panels D and E) required about 20-fold greater T3 concentration relative to wt TR to dissociate this complex. Finally the Δ337 mutant, which cannot bind T3, could not be dissociated from NCoR-I even at the 100 nm T3 concentration. Similar observations were made on the chicken lysozyme TRE (Lys, Fig. 4) and palindromic TRE (data not shown). On the Lys element, a higher T3 concentration was necessary to completely dissociate NCoR-I from wt TR (100 nm). Dissociation of NCoR-I from E220R and Δ234T was similar to wt, while the R243Q and R243W mutant TRs required a 10-fold higher T3concentration (1000 nm) than did wt TR for dissociation. As expected, NCoR-I could not be dissociated from the Δ337T mutant even at this very high T3 concentration.Figure 4Shown is a 32P-labeled Lys gel shift as in Fig. 2 of TRs incubated with NCoR binding domain across a range of T3 concentrations as noted. Hinge mutant TRs required more than 10-fold more T3 to achieve the same degree of dissociation as wt. TRs are A, wt; B, E220R; C, A234T; D, R243Q; E, R243W; and F, Δ337T.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether hinge mutants could normally recruit SRC-1, the NBD-1 of SRC-1 (21Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 49Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar) was fused to the GST protein and expressed in bacteria. Purified GST and GST-SRC-1(NBD-1) were then employed in a gel-shift study of wt and mutant TR binding to a DR+4 probe (Fig. 5). In the absence of T3, SRC-1 did not form a complex with wt TR (panel A). A wt TR·SRC-1 complex was first noted at 2.5 nm and was maximal at 100 nm T3. These results were unexpected since T3 is known to dissociate the TR homodimer and prevent its binding to DNA. The presence of a TR·SRC-1 complex indicates that the SRC-1(NBD-1) must, in some way, stabilize the binding of TR on DNA in the presence of T3. The three hinge mutants also recruited the NBD-1 of SRC-1 with increasing T3 concentrations. The R243Q mutant (panel C) appeared qualitatively similar to wt TR in its ability to recruit SRC-1 over the T3 concentrations tested. The A234T (panel B) and R243W (panel D) mutants required about 2-fold greater T3 concentrations, relative to wt TR, to begin to recruit SRC-1(NBD-1). In Fig. 6, these experiments were repeated in the presence of RXR. SRC-1(NBD-1) was able to bind to both wt TR homodimers and wt TR/RXR heterodimers (panel A) as evidenced by the decrease in intensity of both complexes and the presence of two closely spaced more slowly migrating complexes on a lighter exposure of this autoradiogram (data not shown). Qualitatively, however, the defect in SRC-1 association caused by the hinge mutants was similar to the data obtained without RXR. Thus, hinge mutants display a significantly greater impairment in T3-mediated dissociation from NCoR-I than T3-mediated association to the NBD-1 of SRC-1.Figure 6The relative avidity of TRs for SRC-1 is not altered by the presence of RXR. The TRs were incubated with RXR and SRC-1 across the range of T3 concentrations noted. The hinge mutants demonstrate only minimal defect in recruitment of SRC-1 with approximately twice the T3 concentration as that required by wt TR. Pictured are A, wt; B, E220R;C, A234T; D, R243Q; E, R243W; and F, Δ337T.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether NCoR binding interfered with SRC-1 recruitment, the gel-shift assays were repeated using TR interacting domains from both cofactors. In Fig. 7 gel-shifts obtained using the wt TR and two hinge mutants, R243Q and R243W are shown. Although the TR·NCoR-I and TR·SRC-1(NBD-1) complexes migrated at a similar position, closer inspection revealed that the TR·SRC-1(NBD-1) complex migrated slightly faster than the TR·NCoR-I complex. We used this difference in migration position and an antibody directed against the GST protein to distinguish the two complexes. In the absence of T3 where only NCoR-I would be expected to bind to the wt TR, one distinct complex was formed and the location and intensity of the complex was not affected by addition of the GST antibody (panel A). Conversely at high T3 concentration (100 nm) where only SRC-1(NBD-1) should bind to TR, a faster migrating complex was formed which was completely eliminated by the addition of the GST antibody. A gradual shift from the TR·NCoR-I to the TR·SRC-1(NBD-1) complex was noted over the T3concentrations tested (panel A). Under no condition was a complex formed consistent with binding both NCoR-I and SRC-1(NBD-1) to wt TR. Rather, as the T3concentration rose, the shifted band migrated from the higher TR·NCoR-I position to the lower TR·SRC-1(NBD-1) position. This was particularly well seen at a T3 concentration of 2.5 nm, where both NCoR-I and SRC-1(NBD-1) were capable of binding wt TR when tested individually. At this concentration and in the absence of the GST antibody, wt TR bound in a faster migrating complex consistent with its binding to SRC-1(NBD-1). Addition of the GST antibody shifted the position of the complex slightly to a location predicted for TR·NCoR-I binding. Since the GST antibody interferes with formation of the TR·SRC-1(NBD-1) complex, these data suggest that removal of SRC-1(NBD-1) from the TR allowed NCoR-I in solution to bind to the wt TR. The net result of the impaired NCoR-I dissociation from hinge mutants is also shown in Fig. 7 (panels B and C). Only at 100 nm T3 was NCoR-I sufficiently dissociated from the hinge mutants to permit significant SRC-1(NBD-1) recruitment, based on the position of the protein-DNA complex. The GST antibody blocks formation of this complex, confirming that at this T3 concentration, the hinge mutants bound exclusively to SRC-1(NBD-1). At 10 nm T3, SRC-1(NBD-1) bound somewhat to the hinge mutants based on partial dissociation of the shifted complex by the GST antibody (R243Q > R243W). This result is consistent with the other data showing that the R243Q mutant recruited SRC-1(NBD-1) at lower T3 concentrations than the R243W mutant. Similar data was obtained with the A234T mutant (not shown). Thus, an impairment in NCoR dissociation by T3, as observed with the hinge mutants, prevents SRC-1 recruitment. It is unclear why the hinge mutants displayed such significant impairment in dissociation from NCoR-I in the absence of significant defects in solution binding to T3. Moreover, the R243Q and R243W mutants required significantly greater T3 concentrations to dissociate NCoR-I than did the A234T mutant despite the fact that these receptors had very similar T3 binding profiles. To investigate the reason for this discrepancy, gel-shift assays were performed in parallel using either a32P-labeled DR+4 probe or 125I-T3to identify the shifted complexes. Fig. 8is such an experiment comparing wt and mutant TRs. In vitrotranslated RXR-α and the indicated TR-β were added to each column except columns 1 and 8 where an equal volume of unprogrammed lysate was utilized (UP). In columns 2–7, reticulocyte lysate generated TRs (wt, E220R, A234T, R243Q, R243W, and Δ337T, respectively) were incubated with RXR-α and 32P-labeled DR+4, resulting in heterodimeric and homodimeric complexes of equal intensity. In columns 9–14 the same paradigm was followed except that the 32P-labeled DR+4 pTRE was replaced by a nonradioactive DR+4 pTRE and 125I-T3 was added (10 nm final concentration). As found by others (52Collingwood T.N. Rajanayagam O. Adams M. Wagner R. Cavailles V. Kalkhoven E. Matthews C. Nystrom E. Stenlof K. Lindstedt G. Tisell L. Fletterick R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee V.K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the wt TR/RXR heterodimer was clearly labeled by 125I T3 (lane 9) and the homodimer was not labeled, despite equal amount of these complexes on the 32P- labeled gel-shift. We interpret this result as indicating that occupancy of one TR molecule by radiolabeled T3 marks the heterodimer which is not dissociated by T3, while T3 bound to one TR molecule is sufficient to dissociate the homodimer and eliminate a labeled band at that position. Because of the migration position of free125I T3 on the gel, we could not determine if the wt TR·NCoR-I complex was labeled. The heterodimeric complex containing the A234T mutant was labeled 3-fold less well by T3 (as determined by densitometry) and heterodimers containing the R243Q, R243W, and Δ337T mutants were not labeled. Clearly the Δ337T mutant would not be expected to bind T3; however, results with the hinge mutants were unexpected given their solution T3 binding. These results indicate that solution and DNA-complex binding of T3 by hinge mutants of the TR do not correlate. As a model for thyroid hormone action, two copies of a positive thyroid hormone response element were fused upstream of a heterologous promoter luciferase construct (pTK109-Luc) for use in transient transfection assays of CV-1 cells. On the DR+4 element (Fig. 9,panel A), activation by the wt TR was first noted at 1 nm T3 and reached a maximum at 100 nm T3 Activation of this element by the artificial hinge mutant (E220R) was similar to wt TR (data not shown). The natural hinge mutants were clearly defective in activation compared with wt TR. Activation by the A234T mutant was first achieved at 5 nm T3, while transactivation by the two 243 mutant TRs was first noted at 10 nm T3. At very high T3 doses, however, transactivation by all mutants except Δ337T equaled that of wt TR. Each hinge mutant had strong dominant negative activity against wt TR on the DR+4 element (data not shown). Qualitatively similar results were noted with the everted palindrome element derived from the chicken lysozyme gene promoter, Lys (Fig. 9, panel B). Since transfection of an NCoR inhibitor (NCoR-I) expression vector can reverse TR-mediated repression on pTREs (9Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine if cotransfection of this plasmid could correct the defect in transactivation observed with the hinge mutants. In Fig. 10 A, cotransfection of NCoR-I completely reversed ligand-independent repression by the wt TR on the DR+4 element and yielded similar levels of reporter gene activation in the presence of T3. Since endogenous corepressors (NCoR and SMRT) and NCoR-I are released from wt TR at physiological T3 concentrations, transcriptional repression by endogenous corepressors is selectively removed by NCoR-I without affecting T3-mediated coactivator recruitment and transactivation. In contrast, in Fig. 10 B are data obtained with one of the hinge mutants, R243W. Note that NCoR-I cotransfection completely eliminated TR-mediated repression but did not allow for normal T3-mediated transactivation except at 100 nm T3. Importantly, these transfection studies are consistent with gel-shift studies showing that TR hinge mutants are markedly defective in their ability to dissociate NCoR-I and permit SRC-1 (NBD-1) recruitment. Our study of hinge mutations of the TR has revealed several important properties of TR-mediated transactivation and shed new light on the RTH syndrome. First, hinge mutants of the TR display a defective release of NCoR in response to treatment with T3. Gel-shift studies demonstrate that both 243 mutants, and to a lesser extent the 234 mutant, remain bound to NCoR at concentrations of T3that completely dissociate NCoR from wt TR. Yoh et al. (13Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) first suggested that RTH mutants displayed aberrant interaction with nuclear corepressors. As expected, mutations which bound T3poorly failed to dissociate from corepressor except at very high T3 concentrations. Our results with the Δ337T mutation are in keeping with their findings. However, two mutants located in the AF-2 domain (P453A and P453H) appeared to have a much greater defect in T3-mediated dissociation from corepressor than would be expected due to their mild decrease (4–5-fold) in T3affinity. The authors suggested that a conformation change in the extreme C terminus of TR caused by the mutation might explain this apparent discrepancy by uncoupling T3 binding from corepressor dissociation. We initially favored this hypothesis to explain our findings with the hinge mutants. These mutants displayed good solution T3binding (less than a 2-fold decrease), yet failed to dissociate from NCoR in gel-shift experiments and continued to silence gene transcription in transfection studies except at very high T3 concentrations. Importantly, however, we determined the ability of these mutants to bind to T3 when complexed to DNA. To our surprise, these mutants as RXR heterodimers bound radiolabeled T3 poorly, if at all, in gel shift studies. Our results are limited to the heterodimer complex since TR homodimers were not labeled in this assay, perhaps due to the fact they would be dissociated when bound by T3, and free radiolabeled T3 obscured the TR·NCoR-I complex, Regardless these data suggest that binding of T3 in solution and on DNA do not always correlate as highlighted by mutations in the hinge region of TR. Based on the crystal structure of TR-α, hinge mutants might affect T3 binding (53Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). These mutations are near helix two, which is believed to stabilize the polar pocket which binds T3. Since regions of the hinge domain are known to contact DNA (54Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar, 55Ratinejad F. Perlman T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and to mediate ligand binding (56Lin K.H. Parkison C. McPhie P. Cheng S-Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) it is possible that DNA-binding induces a conformation change in the mutant hinge domain so as either to prevent ligand access to the heterodimeric bound TR or prevent stabilization of ligand-binding on the TR. The net result is that corepressor continues to bind to TR and prevent transactivation despite the presence of T3 in solution. It is unclear whether this discrepancy between solution and DNA-complex binding of T3is specific for hinge mutants or will also be observed with RTH mutants in other locations on the TR-β. In evaluating TR cofactors and their role in RTH, the question of the relative importance of corepressors and coactivators in the genesis of RTH has arisen. For example, impaired ligand-dependent activity could be associated either with impaired (13Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) corepressor release or with defective coactivator recruitment (52Collingwood T.N. Rajanayagam O. Adams M. Wagner R. Cavailles V. Kalkhoven E. Matthews C. Nystrom E. Stenlof K. Lindstedt G. Tisell L. Fletterick R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee V.K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that impaired corepressor release is the primary defect in RTH patients with hinge mutations and probably for most other patients with RTH. This is based on two lines of evidence. 1) Most RTH mutations affect T3 binding to TR in solution or on DNA, as is the case with hinge mutants. This would result in impaired release of corepressor at physiological T3 concentrations and continued gene silencing. 2) Both NCoR and SRC-1 do not bind simultaneously to TR, suggesting at least two discreet steps are necessary for transactivation. Addition of T3 must first cause dissociation of NCoR before recruitment of SRC-1 can take place. Either the binding locations of the two cofactors must overlap such that both cannot be present on TR or the TR conformation when NCoR is bound is such that SRC-1 binding is not favorable. This result is most clearly seen using the NCoR inhibitor in transfection studies. Transfection of NCoR-I competes with endogenous corepressors, resulting in a loss of ligand-independent repression on pTREs caused by the R243W mutation. Remarkably the mutant TR is still unable to activate transcription except at very high T3 concentration. Since mutant TR binding to NCoR-I is also resistant to T3dissociation, SRC-1 or other coactivators are not recruited to the TR due to lack of binding to the corepressor occupied TR, yielding a lack of transactivation. We propose the following model (Fig. 11) based on our results. wt TR, in the absence of ligand, binds corepressor and transcription is repressed. Addition of T3 results in dissociation of corepressor, permitting recruitment of coactivators and transcriptional activation. Although, the hinge mutant TRs bind corepressor normally in the absence of ligand resulting in normal silencing activity, T3 fails to dissociate the corepressor and thus coactivator recruitment is prevented. While T3 binding by the hinge mutant TRs is normal or near-normal in solution, their T3 binding is clearly defective when complexed to DNA. Our data indicate that DNA-binding modifies the ability of hinge mutants to bind T3, yielding this novel mechanism of resistance by this class of RTH mutants."

The elastase propeptide is cleaved autocatalytically in the periplasm to form a transient, inactive elastase-propeptide complex. In contrast, the processing of proLasA does not involve autoproteolysis. In this study, we analyzed short-termP. aeruginosa cultures under conditions that minimize proteolysis and found that an elastase-propeptide complex is secreted, and then the propeptide is degraded extracellularly, apparently by elastase itself. LasA protease, on the other hand, was found to be secreted in its unprocessed 42-kDa proenzyme form. The processing of proLasA occurred extracellularly, and it involved the transient appearance of a 28-kDa intermediate and the respective 14-kDa LasA propeptide fragment. The processing of proLasA in P. aeruginosa strain FRD740, which does not express elastase, also proceeded via the 28-kDa intermediate, but the rate of processing was greatly reduced. This low rate of proLasA processing was further reduced when the activity of a secreted lysine-specific protease was blocked. Purified secreted proteases of P. aeruginosa(i.e. elastase, the lysine-specific protease, and alkaline proteinase) converted proLasA to the active enzyme. Processing by elastase and the lysine-specific enzyme, but not by alkaline proteinase, proceeded via the 28-kDa intermediate, and both were far more effective than alkaline proteinase in converting proLasA to the mature enzyme. We conclude that LasA protease and elastase are secreted with their propeptides, which are then degraded by secreted proteases of P. aeruginosa.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, secretes several proteases into its environment that are implied in the pathogenicity of the organism.

LasA protease action on proteins, including elastin, is limited and directed mainly to Gly3 and Gly2-Ala sequences that are uncommon in most proteins. Elastase, on the other hand, is a potent protease that cleaves proteins at multiple sites and can degrade many host proteins in addition to elastin (1Morihara K. Homma J.Y. Holder I.A. Bacterial Enzymes and Virulence. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 41-79Google Scholar, 2Morihara K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although alkaline proteinase has a broad cleavage specificity, it is not as potent as elastase and has no elastolytic activity. Elastase is a 33-kDa zinc metalloendopeptidase that is closely related to thermolysin (2Morihara K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Kessler E. Ohman D.E. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.in: Barrett A.J. Rawling N.D. Woessner Jr., F. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar). Encoded by lasB, elastase is synthesized as a preproenzyme (53.4 kDa) with a classical signal peptide and a covalently linked 18-kDa amino-terminal propeptide (9Bever R.A. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4309-4314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5241-5247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kessler E. Safrin M. Peretz M. Burstein Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 2.4-kDa signal sequence is removed upon passage through the inner membrane into the periplasm, where the propeptide is rapidly cleaved off by autoproteolysis (12McIver K.S. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7781-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This step is apparently necessary for elastase secretion because an active site mutation blocks the secretion of elastase as well as enzymatic activity and processing (13McIver K.S. Olson J.C. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4008-4015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When lasB is expressed in Escherichia coli, autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide occurs independently of any other P. aeruginosa gene product(s) (12McIver K.S. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7781-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The elastase propeptide acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme (14Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1215-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22726-22731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After autoprocessing, it remains noncovalently associated with the mature domain to form an inactive propeptide-elastase complex, and it is in this form that elastase is found within the periplasm of P. aeruginosa (10Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5241-5247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1215-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22726-22731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The propeptide also functions as an intramolecular chaperone required for correct folding and secretion competence (16McIver K.S. Kessler E. Olson J.C. Ohman D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Braun P. Tommassen J. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Elastase translocation through the outer membrane is mediated by a complex extracellular protein export apparatus (Xcp) of at least 12 genes that bears significant homology to the pullulanase (type II; general secretory pathway) export apparatus of Klebsiella oxytoca (18Tommassen J. Filloux A. Bally M. Murgier M. Lazdunski A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 103: 73-90Crossref Google Scholar). Although the propeptide is required for elastase secretion, the mechanisms involved and the fate of the propeptide remain unknown. LasA protease is a 20-kDa zinc metalloendopeptidase belonging to the β-lytic endopeptidase family of proteases (3Kessler E. Ohman D.E. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.in: Barrett A.J. Rawling N.D. Woessner Jr., F. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar, 4Kessler E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 740-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Like the β-lytic endopeptidase of Achromobacter lyticus (4Kessler E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 740-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), LasA protease is synthesized as a preproenzyme with an unusually long (22 kDa) amino-terminal propeptide, which is larger than the mature domain (19Schad P.A. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2784-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Gustin J.K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6608-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). LasA protease seems to be exported via the Xcp system, but, as compared with elastase, little is known about its maturation and secretion. When expressed in E. coli, proLasA does not undergo autoprocessing and shows little or no enzymatic activity (19Schad P.A. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2784-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Gustin J.K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6608-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Substitution of His120, a putative active site residue of LasA protease (3Kessler E. Ohman D.E. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.in: Barrett A.J. Rawling N.D. Woessner Jr., F. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar, 4Kessler E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 740-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), does not prevent the processing of proLasA in P. aeruginosa, and an enzymatically inactive 20-kDa LasA protein is found in the culture supernatant (20Gustin J.K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6608-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although this suggests that proLasA processing and secretion in P. aeruginosa may proceed by mechanisms that do not involve autoproteolysis, no specific proLasA-processing protease has yet been identified, and the processing site is unknown. Here we show that in P. aeruginosa, both LasA protease and elastase are secreted with their propeptides. However, whereas LasA protease is exported in its unprocessed proenzyme form, elastase seems to be secreted as a noncovalent complex with its propeptide. The propeptides of both enzymes are degraded extracellularly by the action of elastase and other secreted proteases, and the processing of the LasA propeptide proceeds via a distinct 28-kDa intermediate. The corresponding 14-kDa propeptide fragment is also detected. E. colistrains JM109(pJKG107) with lasA under the inducibletrc promoter (20Gustin J.K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6608-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and JM109::DE3(pETPRO) with thelasA propeptide coding sequence fused to a 6× His tag and cloned into the NotI site of pET28b (Invitrogen) were grown in L broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (30 μg/ml), respectively. Prototrophic P. aeruginosa strain FRD2 and its lasBΔ derivative, FRD740 (16McIver K.S. Kessler E. Olson J.C. Ohman D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), were grown in tryptic soy broth without dextrose (Difco; Refs. 8Kessler E. Safrin M. Olson J.C. Ohman D.E. J. Biol.

In some experiments, when absorbance at 660 nm of the bacterial cell suspension reached 2 OD units, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in the original volume of fresh medium, and growth was continued for different time intervals, as indicated. P. aeruginosa strain FRD740(pSDM3.7) with an amber mutation at the propeptide-mature junction of lasB (16McIver K.S. Kessler E. Olson J.C. Ohman D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was grown in tryptic soy broth without dextrose plus 100 μg/ml tetracycline. Culture supernatants for assays of proteolytic activity were prepared by centrifugation (8,000 × gfor 20 min) of the cell suspensions at 4 °C. To prepare samples for SDS-PAGE1 and immunoblotting analyses, P. aeruginosa cells were harvested by centrifugation (Beckman microfuge; 1 min) at room temperature, and the cells were suspended in 10% TCA. The supernatants were recentrifuged for 4 min to remove the remaining bacteria and supplemented with bovine serum albumin (100 μg), and the proteins in the supernatants were immediately precipitated with 10% TCA. After standing overnight at room temperature, the TCA precipitates were pelleted, washed with acetone, air-dried, and dissolved in SDS sample buffer (1:10 of original volume; Ref. 21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting under nondenaturing conditions, samples of the cell cultures were centrifuged (Beckman microfuge; 5 min) at 4 °C, and 0.5-ml aliquots of the cell-free supernatants were immediately transferred into chilled tubes containing 50 μl of TLCK (50 mm) and 1,10-orthophenanthroline (20 mm) in water. After standing on ice for additional 20 min, these samples were frozen and stored at −70 °C until use. Production of proLasA was induced in E. coli JM109(pJKG107) with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma; Ref. 20Gustin J.K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6608-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells from 100-ml cultures were harvested by centrifugation (8,000 × g for 20 min), suspended in 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and broken by sonication. Cell debris was removed by mild centrifugation (6,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the soluble cell fraction was then obtained by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C). Processing solutions (50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 0.25 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) contained 50 μg of protein from the E. coli cell extract and 10 or 50 ng of purified elastase (22Kessler E. Israel M. Landshman N. Chechick A. Blumberg S. Infect. Immun. 1982; 38: 716-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), alkaline proteinase (Nagase), or the lysine-specific protease of P. aeruginosa. The reaction solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by heating in SDS sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The lysine-specific endopeptidase required for this experiment was purified from P. aeruginosa strain FRD2128 by DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously (8Kessler E. Safrin M.

The Cm-cellulose column (2.2 × 23 cm) was equilibrated with 0.02 m Tris-HCl and 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (400 ml; 0–0.6 m). The enzyme emerged from the column at ∼0.4 m NaCl and, as judged by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (data not shown), was homogenous. Fractions containing staphylolytic activity (8Kessler E. Safrin M.

The propeptide of LasA protease was expressed in E. coli strain JM109::DE3(pETPRO) and purified from the soluble fraction of these cells by chromatography on nickel-agarose (Invitrogen). Antibodies to LasA protease were raised in rabbits (14Kessler E. Safrin M. J.

The cells were washed with saline and broken by sonication in 0.02 m Tris-HCl and 0.5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, containing the protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 mm), and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm; also named Pefabloc; Merck). The soluble cell fraction was prepared by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C), and a sample of this fraction containing approximately 15 μg of propeptide was electroblotted to nitrocellulose. The region corresponding to the propeptide was identified by staining with Ponceau S and used after excision for immunoadsorption (23Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The elastase-propeptide antibody was used at a 1:1,000 or 1:100 dilution for immunoblots of SDS or nondenaturing gels, respectively. Immunoaffinity-purified antibodies to denatured elastase (10Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5241-5247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) with 4% stacking gels and 12% separating gels. Electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was performed according to the method of Davis (26Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15912) Google Scholar), except that the gel and electrode buffers contained 5 and 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, respectively. The electroblotting of proteins from SDS gels to nitrocellulose was performed in ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.4 (27Szewczyk B. Kozloff L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The transfer of proteins from nondenaturing gels was performed in Tris (7.5 mm)-borate (1.2 mm) buffer, pH 8.9, containing 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm). These blots were treated with 3% TCA for 30 min, washed with Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated for 30 min at 50 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, containing 2% SDS and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to denature the proteins. All blots were blocked with 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline, and after incubation with a specific antibody, immunoreactive bands were detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence. Our previous studies on the processing and secretion of LasA protease relied on analyses of overnight cultures of P. aeruginosa. The results of these studies indicated that the proteolytic processing of proLasA is not autocatalytic and may involve other secreted proteases of P. aeruginosa (20Gustin J.K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6608-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The processing protease, its cellular location, and the stage during secretion at which processing occurs remained unknown. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the maturation and secretion of the LasA protease, in the present study, we defined conditions that allow the identification of short-lived secreted protein species. Late-log P. aeruginosacells were suspended in fresh medium, samples were removed at short intervals after medium replacement, and TCA was added to both the cell and medium fractions to prevent proteolysis. Immunoblots with antibodies to LasA protease revealed that at any of the time points examined, the cells contained only proLasA (Fig. 1 A). Although the amount of cell-associated proLasA decreased during the 2-h period of the experiment, this was not accompanied by the appearance of smaller LasA-related proteins, suggesting that no processing of proLasA had occurred within the cells. Consistent with this, medium samples taken at early time points contained proLasA as the only LasA-related protein (Fig. 1, B and C, 0 and 10 min). Extracellular processing was evident within 20 min and proceeded in a time-dependent manner, with just a trace of proLasA remaining after 2 h (120 min). At 20 min, small amounts of mature-size (20 kDa) LasA protease and a 28-kDa processing intermediate were detected in the medium, and their levels increased with time, in parallel to the disappearance of proLasA (40–120 min). The 28-kDa processing intermediate apparently resulted from cleavage(s) within a region in the propeptide that is sensitive to proteolysis (rather than multiple random cleavages) because a 14-kDa propeptide fragment recognized by antibodies to the LasA propeptide but not by anti-LasA protease antibodies was also detected (Fig. 1 C, 20–120 min). ProLasA and the 28-kDa processing intermediate were visualized with antibodies to both mature LasA protease and the LasA propeptide (compare B and C in Fig. 1), and immunoblots of cell extracts with the LasA propeptide antibody (data not shown) yielded a pattern indistinguishable from that obtained with the LasA protease antibody (Fig. 1 A), detecting proLasA as the only cell-associated propeptide-related band. Collectively, these results indicate that proLasA is not processed in the cell. Instead, proLasA is exported in its unprocessed form, and the propeptide is degraded extracellularly in a stepwise manner by the action of other secreted proteases of P. aeruginosa. Secretion of proLasA appears to occur rapidly after its formation because, at any time, the level of cell-associated proLasA was far smaller than that of the secreted precursor and its extracellular processing products together (compareA and B in Fig. 1). Elastase is the prominent and most potent protease secreted by most P. aeruginosa strains. To examine whether elastase may play a role in proLasA processing and to further establish the extracellular location of this reaction, we compared proLasA secretion and processing in strains FRD2 (wild type) and FRD740 (lasBΔ). Cells were grown continuously (i.e.without medium replacement), and aliquots were removed at 30-min intervals from the late logarithmic phase into the early stationary phase (3–7 h). Cell and media samples were both analyzed for LasA-related proteins by immunoblotting, and the level of proteolytic activity in the supernatants was determined using azocasein as the substrate. The rate of growth of both strains was also compared and found to be practically the same (Fig. 2 A). The cell fractions of both strains contained comparable amounts of proLasA, and no smaller LasA-related proteins were detected in extracts from either strain (Fig. 2, B and C, compare the top panels), indicating that proLasA production and secretion in both strains were similar. However, the rate of proLasA processing in the culture supernatants of strain FRD740 was reduced as compared with that found for strain FRD2 (Fig. 2, B and C, comparebottom panels). During the 3–7-h period examined, virtually no proLasA was detectable in the supernatants of strain FRD2, suggesting that processing in the supernatants of this strain occurred rapidly after secretion. Culture supernatants of strain FRD740, on the other hand, contained significant amounts of unprocessed proLasA, which decreased gradually from 6 h onward, in parallel to the limited increase in proteolytic activity in the medium (see Fig. 2 A). In both strains, processing proceeded via the 28-kDa intermediate. However, this processing intermediate accumulated in the growth medium of strain FRD740 but not in that of strain FRD2. Accordingly, the levels of fully processed LasA protease in the medium of strain FRD2 exceeded those in the medium of strain FRD740 (Fig. 2,B and C, bottom panels). A correlation was evident between the rate of extracellular proLasA processing and the level of proteolytic activity in the medium, which was 6–8-fold higher at any time in supernatants of strain FRD2 than in those of strain FRD740 (Fig. 2 A). These results reinforced the extracellular location of proLasA processing and indicated a role for elastase in this process. However, the demonstration that proLasA can be processed in the growth medium of strain FRD740 suggested that other secreted proteases of P. aeruginosa in addition to elastase may be involved. To investigate this, we examined which of the two best candidates, alkaline proteinase and the lysine-specific endopeptidase, could process proLasA in vitro in a manner similar to that of elastase. Samples of an E. coli extract containing recombinant (inactive) proLasA were incubated with equal amounts of purified elastase, alkaline proteinase, or the lysine-specific endopeptidase, and then proLasA processing was evaluated by immunoblotting. Fig. 3 shows that each of the three endopeptidases can convert proLasA to the 20-kDa mature-size LasA protease. However, whereas both the lysine-specific endopeptidase and elastase were highly and equally effective in proLasA processing, alkaline proteinase was relatively inefficient in this regard (comparelanes 2–4 for digests with 10 ng of protease or lanes 5–7 for digests with 50 ng of protease). Furthermore, whereas processing by elastase and the lysine-specific endopeptidase proceeded via the 28-kDa intermediate, no such intermediate was observed with alkaline proteinase (lanes 3 and 6). Apparently, alkaline proteinase cleaved the LasA propeptide randomly, generating multiple fragments that escaped from the gel and thus were not detectable. Elastase and the lysine-specific protease, on the other hand, appeared to cleave first a peptide bond(s) within the same region of the propeptide and generate the 28-kDa intermediate, and then the remaining carboxyl-terminal portion of the propeptide was degraded. Complete conversion of proLasA to the 20-kDa LasA protein by any of these proteases (for alkaline proteinase, this was achieved upon extended incubation with 50 ng of enzyme) was accompanied by a comparable increase in staphylolytic activity (data not shown)"

It has been shown that an analogous peptide from the β2-adrenergic receptor disrupted dimerization and adenylyl cyclase activation in the β2-adrenergic receptor (Hebert, T.

Treatment of D1DR with the D1DR transmembrane 6 peptide resulted in a dose-dependent, irreversible inhibition of D1DR antagonist binding, an effect not seen in D1DR with peptides based on transmembrane domains of other G protein-coupled receptors. Incubation with the D1DR transmembrane 6 peptide also resulted in a dose-dependent attenuation of both dopamine-induced [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding and receptor-mediated dopamine stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Notably, GTPγS binding and cAMP production were reduced to levels below baseline, indicating blockade of ligand-independent, intrinsic receptor activity. Immunoblot analyses of the D1DR revealed the receptor existed as monomers, dimers, and higher order oligomers and that these oligomeric states were unaffected after incubation with the D1DR transmembrane 6 peptide. These findings represent the first demonstration that a peptide based on the transmembrane 6 of the D1DR may represent a novel category of noncompetitive D1DR antagonists.

Dopamine receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 and mediate the many biological actions of the neurotransmitter dopamine in brain and periphery. The distinct biological functions of dopamine are mediated by the five dopamine receptor subtypes, that are divided into the D1-like (D1 and D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) subfamilies. We have previously provided evidence for the existence of dimers and oligomers of the D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (1Ng G.Y. Mouillac B. George S.R. Caron M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Eur. J.

A survey of receptor families (other than the GPCRs) reveals that these receptors are often organized into functional units that involve dimerized or oligomerized proteins. Dimerization of receptor monomers is a critical and necessary mechanism for signal transduction in tyrosine kinase receptors (11Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar) such as the epidermal growth factor (12Schlessinger J. J.

Endocrinol. 1994; 7: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of GPCR oligomers remains unknown. Intriguing insights from studies using receptor chimeras have suggested that both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions occur in GPCRs (16Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), but the role of such interactions in signal transduction is not known. Peptide sequences derived from specific regions of large proteins have been successfully studied to elucidate the function of these regions. The use of such peptide “probes” has enabled the mapping of the functional domains of certain proteins and the identification of domains that promote interactions with other proteins. This strategy has also been used in the study of GPCRs. For instance, studies have used peptides corresponding to the third cytoplasmic loops of GPCRs to elucidate the importance of this region of the receptor for interaction with G proteins.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15776-15785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a peptide derived from transmembrane (TM) domain 6 of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) was shown to disrupt dimers of that receptor in parallel with inhibition of agonist-induced adenylyl cyclase activity (6Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that these observations were the result of an interference with an amino acid motif in TM6 of the β2AR postulated to be important for dimerization. However, the D1 dopamine receptor (D1DR) does not contain a dimerization motif similar to the β2AR, and whether dimer disruption by TM6-derived peptide occurs in other GPCRs is not known. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of a peptide derived from TM6 of the D1DR on the oligomeric state and function of the D1DR, despite the lack of a dimerization motif as proposed for the β2AR. GPCRs are considered to have a central core consisting of the seven TMs aligned as α-helices that is important in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the receptor and the pocket created for agonist binding (20Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that disruption of the TM core may alter agonist interaction and signal transduction. We also hypothesized that the interaction between helical TMs within a GPCR could be manipulated by the addition of exogenous peptides containing a particular TM sequence, which would compete for the sites of interaction of the native TM region of the receptor and disrupt receptor architecture. Furthermore, a model based on amino acid sequence analysis and computer simulations predicts that GPCR dimers have multiple sites of interaction (21Gouldson P.R. Snell C.R. Reynolds C.A. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3871-3886Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that circumscribed disruption of receptor structure by a TM peptide will not coincide with a loss of oligomeric structure. Hence, these observations provided the scientific basis for the speculation that TMs of GPCRs may be possible targets for inhibition of receptor activity but have no effect on oligomerization. Details of the construction of the recombinant baculovirus encoding the c-myc epitope-tagged human D1DR have been reported previously (1Ng G.Y. Mouillac B. George S.R. Caron M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 3Ng G.Y. Trogadis J. Stevens J. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10157-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All culture media, antibiotics, and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Sf9 cells were maintained at 27 °C in Grace's insect media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.5 × antibiotic-antimycotic, and 1% (v/v) Pluronic F-68, a surfactant. The cells were grown either as monolayer cultures in T flasks or as suspension cultures in spinner flasks. Suspension cultures were infected with baculovirus when cell density was 1–3 × 106 cells/ml with a multiplicity of infection of approximately 5. Membranes were prepared from the cells 48 h after infection unless otherwise noted. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamide, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.4), and homogenized by Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments). The homogenate was centrifuged to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting pellet was washed and resuspended in lysis buffer. Peptides were synthesized using standard solid state methodology by Quality Control Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA) and stored desiccated at 4 °C. Typically for experiments, 5 mg of peptide was dissolved in 200 μl of pH 7.4 Tris-buffered solution of 50% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide and 2.5% (w/v) digitonin. The peptide solution was then diluted to a volume of 1 mL with 800 μl of Tris-HCl/NaCl/EDTA buffer for a final composition of 1 mg/ml peptide, 10% dimethylsulfoxide, 0.5% digitonin, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Peptide sequences and the regions from which they were derived were as follows: D1DR TM6, SVIMGVFVCCWLPFFILNCIL (amino acids 275–295); D2DR TM5, PAFVVYSSIVSFYVPFIVTL (amino acids 187–206); D2DR intracellular loop domain 3, LSSTSPPERTRYSPIPPSHH (amino acids 284–303); and β2AR TM6, GIIMGTFTLCWLPFFIVNIVH (amino acids 276–296). Saturation binding and competition binding assays were performed as described previously (1Ng G.Y. Mouillac B. George S.R. Caron M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,3Ng G.Y. Trogadis J. Stevens J. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10157-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, for saturation experiments, 20–25 μg of membrane from D1DR-expressing cells was incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]SCH 23390 (NEN Life Science Products). The reaction volume was 0.5 ml, and the binding buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKCl, and 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Nonspecific binding was defined using 1 μm (+)-butaclamol (Research Biochemicals International, Hercules, CA). For competition binding experiments, 20–25 μg of membrane was incubated with ∼600 pm [3H]SCH 23390 and increasing concentrations of cold competitor. For both assays, binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 2 h to reach equilibrium. Bound radioligand was then isolated from free by rapid filtration through a Brandel 48-well harvester using Whatman GF/C filters. Data were analyzed using nonlinear least squares regression equations on the curve-fitting computer program Prism version 2.01 (Graphpad). Full details of the [35S]GTPγS binding methods have been reported elsewhere (22Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, D1DR-mediated dopamine stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding before and after treatment with the peptides was measured using 15–20 μg of membrane protein incubated in a medium containing 20 mm HEPES, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% ascorbate, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6, with 0.1 μmol of [35S]GTPγS at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was quenched with 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl and 5 mm MgCl2. Nucleotide bound to Gs was separated by filtration with quenching buffer. Nonspecific binding, measured by 500-fold excess of GTP, was always <10% of total binding. Adenylyl cyclase assays were conducted essentially as described previously (1Ng G.Y. Mouillac B. George S.R. Caron M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The assay mix contained 0.02 ml of membrane suspension (10–25 μg of protein), 0.012 mm ATP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.053 mmGTP, 2.7 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 units of pyruvate kinase, 1 unit of myokinase, and 0.13 μCi of [α-32P]ATP in a final volume of 0.05 ml. Enzyme activities were determined in duplicate or triplicate assay tubes containing 10−9–10−3m dopamine and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 0.4 mmATP, 0.3 mm cAMP, and [3H]cAMP (25,000 cpm). Where indicated, P2 membranes were pretreated with increasing concentrations of the peptides for 20 min on ice before determination of adenylyl cyclase activity. cAMP was isolated by sequential column chromatography using Dowex cation exchange resin and aluminum oxide. Data were analyzed by computer-fitted nonlinear least squares regression. The protein samples were subjected to reducing or non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10 or 12% precast acrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry transfer apparatus. The nitrocellulose was blocked using 10% (w/v) skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated in 1% skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing the 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The primary antibody was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and an alkaline phosphatase detection kit (Bio-Rad). The relative intensities of bands detected by immunostaining were determined using reflective densitometry and the Gel Doc 1000 video documentation system and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). We have previously characterized c-myc-tagged D1DR expressed in Sf9 cells (1Ng G.Y. Mouillac B. George S.R. Caron M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Eur. J.

All results obtained from Sf9 cell membranes are from cells expressing ∼5–10 pmol of receptor 48 h after infection (cellular viability, ∼90%). D1DR in Sf9 membranes bound the antagonist [3H]SCH 23390 with a K d of 552.9 ± 27 pm (n = 6). Incubation of membranes with increasing concentrations of D1DR TM6 peptide resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of [3H]SCH 23390 binding (Fig. 1). No effect on binding was observed when membranes were incubated with a peptide derived from TM5 of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR) or a peptide based on a portion of the D2DR third intracellular loop domain. The IC50 of peptide inhibition of [3H]SCH 23390 binding to D1DR was 1.7 ± 0.2 mm (n = 6). TheK i was determined to be 460 ± 39 μm . The saturation isotherms for [3H]SCH 23390 in the presence of increasing concentrations of the D1DR TM6 peptide revealed a dose-dependent blockade of antagonist binding in an irreversible manner. The unoccluded receptors remained homogenous, with no change in the saturable nature of antagonist binding. To determine whether the D1DR TM6 peptide had the ability to bind the ligand directly, an assay was performed in which the concentration of ligand present in the filtrate was measured after collecting the membranes on a filter. These results showed there was <10% depletion of the concentration of free ligand by the addition of the TM peptide (data not shown). Furthermore, attenuation of D1DR binding was still observed in membranes that were washed extensively after peptide treatment (data not shown). This indicates that the D1DR TM6 peptide does not affect binding because of an interaction between free peptide and ligand and also affirms that the peptide-receptor interaction is likely irreversible. In Sf9 cell membranes expressing the D2DR, [3H]spiperone binding was unaffected by pretreatment with 1 mm D1DR TM6 peptide (control, B max= 1.8 ± 0.2 pmol/mg; K D = 323 ± 24 pm; peptide-treated, B max = 1.7 ± 0.3 pmol/mg; K D = 337 ± 43 pm). D1DR TM6 peptide also had no effect on [3H]carboxamidotryptamine maleate binding in 5-HT1D serotonin receptor-expressing Sf9 cell membranes (control, B max = 1.3 ± 0.2 pmol/mg; K D = 2.73 ± 0.13 nm; peptide-treated, B max = 1.3 ± 0.1 pmol/mg;K D = 2.74 ± 0.38 nm). In membranes prepared from vehicle-treated cells, analysis of agonist competition curves indicated two agonist-detected affinity states (∼25% high affinity state, ∼75% low affinity state). The high and low affinity values were determined to be 10 ± 1.4 and 1100 ± 151 nm, respectively. For membranes in which the D1DR had been exposed to the D1DR TM6 peptide, two agonist-detected affinity states were also observed with inhibition constants that were similar to those of untreated cells (Fig. 2). However, total specific binding was significantly reduced, as would be predicted from the saturation binding experiments. Treatment of membranes from D1DR-expressing Sf9 cells with dopamine resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the binding of [35S]GTPγS (Fig. 3 A). This agonist-induced binding was attenuated when membranes were incubated with D1DR TM6 peptide (data not shown). Furthermore, D1DR TM6 peptide treatment of the D1DR-expressing membranes in the absence of dopamine resulted in a suppression of basal [35S]GTPγS binding to a level approaching that of membranes from wild-type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Fig. 3 B). D1DR in Sf9 cells mediated a dose-dependent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by dopamine (Fig. 4 A). Dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase was not detected in Sf9 cells infected with wild-type recombinant baculovirus (data not shown). After treatment with increasing concentrations of D1DR TM6 peptide, there was a dose-dependent reduction in maximal dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 4, A and B). In the presence of 300 μm TM6 peptide, theV max of dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was reduced by ∼80%. As with the results from the GTPγS experiments, peptide treatment suppressed adenylyl cyclase activity to a level below the baseline value for untreated D1DR-expressing Sf9 cells (Fig. 4 A). The monoclonal antibody 9E10, directed against the c-myc epitope tag of the D1DR enabled immunodetection by Western blotting. The antibody has been previously characterized to be specific for the c-myc epitope, with no cross-reactivity to Sf9 proteins (23Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 24Evan G.I. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1985; 43: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and is ideal for the immunodetection of the c-myc-D1DR in these cells, as we have previously reported (1Ng G.Y.

The immunoblot analysis of D1DR-expressing Sf9 cells revealed the presence of a ∼48-kDa protein, representing a receptor monomer, and a ∼100-kDa protein, representing a receptor dimer and higher species (Fig. 5, lane 1). We have shown previously that Sf9 cell-expressed GPCRs are not heavily glycosylated and do not co-migrate with G protein when subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1Ng G.Y. Mouillac B.

Thus, we conclude that the higher molecular weight species of specific immunoreactivity represent higher order oligomers of the D1DR, possibly tetramers. Exposure of membranes to the D1DR TM6 peptide resulted in no significant change in both the monomer and the dimer species of the D1DR and no alteration of the overall proportion of receptor dimers to monomers (Fig. 5, lane 2). The effect of other peptides derived from TM domains of other receptors and membrane proteins was also examined for effects on the D1DR. A peptide based on the TM6 of the β2AR (Fig. 5, lane 3) and other α-helical peptides (data not shown) did not disrupt the D1DR dimer. In the present study, we have shown that incubation of the dopamine D1DR with a peptide derived from TM6 of the same receptor disrupted D1DR function in an irreversible, dose-dependent manner. D1DR TM6 peptide treatment resulted in inhibition of ligand binding to the D1DR and attenuation of the D1DR-linked functions of G protein activation and adenylyl cyclase stimulation. These effects on the D1DR were specific for the D1DR TM6 peptide and were not seen with comparable TM peptides from other GPCRs or with other unrelated peptides. D1DR TM6 peptide treatment did not affect ligand binding of the D2DR and the 5-HT1D serotonin receptor. Peptide treatment was not accompanied by any change in the oligomeric state of the D1DR, because no disruption of receptor dimers or higher order oligomers was observed even at peptide concentrations that completely prevented antagonist binding and dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation. This report is the first to demonstrate that a peptide based on a TM of a GPCR can inhibit ligand binding and agonist-induced G protein activation by the receptor from which it is derived. We provide evidence that the D1DR TM6 peptide has properties of a D1DR inverse agonist, because peptide treatment suppressed the effect of D1DR on GTPγS binding and adenylyl cyclase activity to levels significantly below those observed in the absence of agonist. Furthermore, the observations of inverse agonism under agonist-absent conditions and of minimal ligand depletion by the D1DR TM6 strongly suggested that the peptide interacted with the receptor and did not mediate its effects through binding ligand independently of receptor. These results differ from what has been reported for the β2AR, for which a peptide based on TM6 of the β2AR has been shown to dissociate β2AR dimers to monomers and to disrupt agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity without affecting ligand binding (6Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). It was postulated that β2AR dimers were critical for receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity and that the dissociation of β2AR dimers by β2AR TM6 peptide resulted in the loss of cAMP production. The reason for the discrepancy with our results in not clear. Hebert et al. (6Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) proposed that a motif in TM6 of the β2AR that is analogous to one reported for the membrane protein glycophorin A (26Bormann B.J. Knowles W.J. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4033-4037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7683-7689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the basis for β2AR dimerization. However, in the D1DR, there is no similar motif in any of the putative transmembrane domains. Thus, the D1DR may undergo dimerization by some other mechanism, independent of what has been proposed for the β2AR in which TM6 was postulated to participate in the critical dimer interface. The ability of a single peptide derived from a TM region to disrupt function of the D1DR attests to the critical intermolecular interactions that must be present within the receptor to maintain the three-dimensional conformation necessary for agonist interaction and signal transduction. The D1DR and other GPCRs are predicted to have a tightly packed TM core consisting of the seven TMs aligned as α-helices arranged sequentially in a counterclockwise arrangement (29Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These TM regions contain highly conserved amino acid residues that are important in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the receptor and the pocket for agonist binding (20Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). There is now an abundance of evidence demonstrating that the precise positioning of individual residues within the helical bundle to allow contact points between neighboring helices is critical for the creation of the agonist binding site and other necessary conformations of the receptor (30Sealfon S.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11937-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies of GPCRs have suggested that the proper folding of GPCR monomers involves intramolecular interactions between TM1 and TM7 (34Suryanarayana S. von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21991-21994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the necessity of amino acids residing on different TM domains to come together to form the ligand-binding crevice deep within the TM core has been elegantly demonstrated (35Javitch J.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 412-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the assignment of specific helical positions relative to one another and the location of residues that mediate the interhelical interactions are not fully known at present. From our studies, it would appear that for the D1DR, the D1DR TM6 peptide is able to distort the receptor conformation sufficiently to prevent its proper interaction with agonist or antagonist ligands and to interfere with basal intrinsic activity of the receptor. We propose that the mechanism of the antagonism exerted by the TM-based peptide is the interaction and binding of the peptide to the TMs of the receptor protein, resulting in competition and interference with the intramolecular interactions of the receptor. This type of interference may result in disruption of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor. There have been reports showing that polypeptide fragments containing the TM segments of bacteriorhodopsin, when expressed together, are able to reassemble into functional proteins (36Marti T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9312-9322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) suggesting that the TM domains of a GPCR are able to “find” the specific interacting amino acids from neighboring domains. Therefore, it is possible that a peptide mimicking a TM segment of the D1DR is able to interact specifically with the TMs of the D1DR. The exact manner in which the TM peptide interacts with the receptor protein is not known. Several possibilities exist, and these include contact with an external face of a TM or the direct insertion into the hydrophobic interior core of the receptor. It has been suggested that GPCRs may even “open up” their hydrophobic core during their interconversion between monomer and dimer (37Gouldson P.R. Reynolds C.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and this process may provide the means for a TM peptide to embed itself within a receptor core. Despite the speculative nature of these ideas, they may provide the basis for novel strategies in the design of receptor-selective antagonists. Our results also indicate that the interference from the TM6 peptide was insufficient to disrupt the D1DR dimer. In a dimerized receptor protein, each monomer may contribute multiple residues or receptor domains toward common structural elements, such as the ligand binding pocket or the dimer interface. One recent model proposed postulates TM domain swapping between receptor monomers resulting in dimerization (21Gouldson P.R. Snell C.R. Reynolds C.A. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3871-3886Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). If such a model is true, it is unlikely that interfering with a single transmembrane domain would result in disruption of dimers into monomers. Our results show the TM peptide interferes with receptor function probably by mimicking the natural dynamics of this domain of the receptor and that the dimerization or oligomerization process likely involves a complex interaction of multiple receptor domains because it is not affected by interference with a single TM domain. This study represents the first demonstration that a peptide derived from the TM of a GPCR disrupts ligand binding in the receptor from which it was derived. We also have shown that the D1DR peptide disrupts intrinsic D1DR activity despite the lack of oligomer dissociation. TM peptides derived from GPCRs may represent a novel category of antagonists with the possible advantage over traditional receptor blockers in being highly selective to a particular class or subtype of receptor."

In a previous paper, we reported that p40phox undergoes phosphorylation on multiple sites upon stimulation of the NADPH oxidase by either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or by formyl peptide with a time course that is strongly correlated with that of superoxide production (Fuchs, A., Bouin, A.

In this study, through phosphoamino acid and tryptic peptide maps of in vivo and in vitro phosphorylated p40phox, we show that p40phox is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues during activation of the NADPH oxidase in dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL60 promyelocytes as well as in isolated human neutrophils. In vitro phosphorylation studies using casein kinase II and protein kinase C (PKC) as well as the effect of various protein kinase inhibitors on the isoelectric focusing pattern of p40phox in whole cell lysates point to a role of a PKC type kinase in the phosphorylation of p40phox.

In response to invasive microorganisms, neutrophils and other phagocytic cells react violently to produce superoxide anion and other microbicidal toxic oxygen derivatives in the phagocytosis vacuole. This phenomenon is known as the respiratory burst, and the mechanism by which these cells regulate the burst is not yet fully elucidated. The production of superoxide anion is assigned to a multicomponent system, the NADPH oxidase, which consists of a membrane-bound flavocytochromeb and a small G protein Rac as well as cytosolic factors p67phox1(phagocyte oxidase), p47phox, and p40phox (for review, see Refs. 2Morel F.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It seems plausible that some modification occurs during oxidase activation which could probably change the specificity of the proline-rich domain of p47phox for either the SH3 domain of p40phox or the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox. This modification could be the phosphorylation of p47phox on a cluster of serine residues close to the polyproline motif in the COOH-terminal region. However, we have recently stressed the fact that the time course of p40phox phosphorylation is strongly correlated with that of superoxide production (1Fuchs A. Bouin A.P. Rabilloud T. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and we have postulated that p40phox phosphorylation could therefore play a critical role in the rearrangement of the ternary complex consisting of p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox during the respiratory burst. In this report we identify activation-induced phosphorylation sites on p40phox and describe experimental data supporting a critical role of the state of phosphorylation of these residues on the structure of the cytosolic activating complex. 33Pi at 4,000Ci/mmol was purchased from NEN Life Science Products.

Cells were washed twice in phosphate-free buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mmKCl and cultured in phosphate-free RPMI medium supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm glutamine, and 0.5 mCi/ml 33Pi. After 3 h at 37 °C, cells were pretreated with 1 μm okadaic acid for 10 min before activation with PMA at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 3 min at 37 °C. In PKC inhibition studies, bisindolylmaleimide (GFX) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm to the cells 10 min before activation. For immunoprecipitation experiments, antibodies were cross-linked beforehand to protein A-Sepharose beads as described (1Fuchs A. Bouin A.P. Rabilloud T. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and were stored in NaCl/Pi with 0.01% NaN3 at 4 °C until needed. For each immunoprecipitation assay, cells were harvested, metabolically labeled, and then activated as described above. After the activation step, the cell pellets were resuspended in 600 μl of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol supplemented with 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, 125 nm okadaic acid, 250 μmNa3VO4, and 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. After a 15-min incubation on ice, the homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 ×g. The supernatant was incubated with 30 μl of cross-linked p67phox antibody-protein A-Sepharose beads for no more than 45 min at 4 °C. Longer incubation times resulted in partial dephosphorylation of p40phox. Even with careful control of incubation temperature and the addition of freshly prepared antiphosphatases, no phosphorylation could be visualized with incubation times longer than 2 h. After four 1-ml washes in Nonidet P-40 buffer, the immunocomplexes were solubilized in Laemmli depolymerization buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 11% acrylamide gel followed by electrotransfer onto a PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was dried and radioactivity detected as above. After immunoprecipitation was carried out on metabolically labeled cells, the immunocomplex still linked to the protein A-Sepharose beads was incubated with 2 units of thrombin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. Laemmli solubilization buffer was added directly to the bead suspension. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and this was followed by immunodetection with an anti-p40phoxNH2-terminal antiserum and exposure to a PhosphorImager screen. 33Pi-labeled immunocomplexes were solubilized directly in IEF buffer (9 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm spermine base, pH 11). Isoelectric focusing was carried out as described by Rabilloud et al. (21Rabilloud T. Valette C. Lawrence J.J. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 1552-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) using Immobiline DryStrips from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The second dimension was carried out on a 15-cm long 9% acrylamide gel as described by Laemmli and Favre (22Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional gel was electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in NaCl/Pi buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone with an average molecular weight of 40,000 (23Haycock J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and probed with anti-p40phoxantiserum at a dilution of 1/1,000 in the previous buffer. The presence of primary antibody was detected with protein A coupled to horseradish peroxidase using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. The full-length clone of p40phox starting at 18 base pairs before the start codon was obtained as described (7Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and cloned in the pET-32a plasmid (Invitrogen) downstream of the thioredoxin (Trx) coding sequence and poly-His tag. Directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Residues Thr154, Thr211, Thr251, Thr274, Ser315, and Thr327 were mutated to alanine using sense and antisense primers containing one mismatch and designed according the manufacturer's specifications. The double mutant (T154A/S315A) was obtained after a second round of directed mutagenesis on the T154A mutant cDNA. After confirmation by sequencing, the pET-32a plasmids carrying the mutated forms of p40phox were transfected into competent bacteria, and the fusion protein was expressed and purified as described below. The protease-deficient BL21-DE3(pLysS)Escherichia coli strain was transformed with the pET-32a plasmid carrying the wild-type or mutated forms of p40phox. An overnight preculture was diluted 10-fold in fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C with agitation for 1 h before induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, supplemented with 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with ProBond resin (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was packed into a fast protein liquid chromatography column and washed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 30 mm imidazole. The fusion protein was eluted with 75 mm imidazole and digested with 20 units of enterokinase/mg of protein in enterokinase buffer (Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. Digestion products and enterokinase could be separated further on a Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with an NaCl gradient in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9. The assays consisted of 1 μg of recombinant protein, 20 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, either 8-microunits of PKC or 60 ng of casein kinase II (CKII) α subunit (kind gift of Dr. O. Filhol, Laboratory BRCE, CEA-Grenoble, France) in 10 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. In PKC assays, the buffer was supplemented with 0.2 mmCaCl2 and 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine. Phosphorylation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. After SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, incorporation of phosphate was visualized using the PhosphorImager apparatus. p40phox labeled either in vitro by 32Pi or in vivo by33Pi was detected on the membrane by a specific anti-p40phox antiserum, and radioactivity was detected using a PhosphorImager apparatus. For phosphoamino acid analysis, the band corresponding to p40phoxwas excised from a PVDF membrane, and p40phox was hydrolyzed in 6 nHCl for 1 h at 110 °C. After drying, the hydrolysate was supplemented with phosphoamino acid standards and spotted onto a cellulose thin layer plate. Phosphoamino acids were separated by high voltage electrophoresis in pH 3.5 buffer (24Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar). Standards were stained with ninhydrin, and radioactivity was detected using the PhosphorImager apparatus. For tryptic peptide maps, the nitrocellulose band carrying p40phox was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by high voltage electrophoresis and chromatography on a cellulose thin layer plate as described in Ref. 24Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar. Phosphopeptides were detected using the PhosphorImager apparatus (exposure of 24–72 h). When indicated, phosphopeptide spots were scraped from the cellulose, and phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described (24Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar). Peptides phospho-TRK and phospho-TR were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) precursors on an Applied Biosystems 432A peptide synthesizer in J. Garin's laboratory (Chimie des Protéines, CEA-Grenoble). Cleavage from the resin and removal of side chains were performed by treatment with 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, and 5% ethanedithiol. We had shown previously that p40phox is phosphorylated during the course of NADPH oxidase activation (1Fuchs A. Bouin A.P. Rabilloud T. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To identify the amino acids that are modified in tight correlation with the level of superoxide production, we first undertook a phosphoamino acid analysis of in vivophosphorylated p40phox. Dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL60 cells were metabolically labeled with33Pi and activated by PMA. The p67phox-p47phox-p40phoxcomplex was immunoprecipitated using an anti-p67phox antiserum. The immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the resolved proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. p40phoxwas identified by Western blotting, and the band carrying p40phox was excised from the PVDF membrane. Hydrolysis of peptide bonds was achieved by concentrated hydrochloric acid, and phosphoamino acids were separated by high voltage electrophoresis. By comparing the positions of the phosphoamino acid standards stained with ninhydrin with the profile obtained after PhosphorImager exposure, both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues are clearly present in activated p40 phox (Fig. 1). For tryptic peptide mapping of p40 phox, the band corresponding to p40 phox was excised from the nitrocellulose membrane, and the protein was digested by trypsin in situ. Tryptic peptides were separated by high voltage electrophoresis followed by chromatography. The two-dimensional profile of p40 phox obtained from PMA-activated differentiated HL60 cells is shown in Fig. 2 A. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the two major spots (peptides 1 and 2) revealed only phosphothreonine (panel B). Because of the limited amount of radioactivity, the minor spots were not analyzed further in this manner (peptides 3–6). To localize the phosphorylation sites in p40 phox we tested various proteases for their efficiency to digest p40 phox partially. Thrombin proved to be a suitable protease for this study because it breaks p40 phox down into only two products, a 16-kDa NH2-terminal polypeptide and a COOH-terminal 23-kDa polypeptide. After transfer of the two polypeptides to a PVDF membrane, the proteolysis site was identified by NH2-terminal sequencing of the 23-kDa product 2J. Garin, unpublished observation. as being Arg153 in the -Pro-Arg153-Thr- site upstream of the p40 phox SH3 domain (data not shown). After metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of the p67 phox -p47 phox -p40 phox complex using the anti-p67 phox antiserum, we added thrombin to both the resting complex and the activated complex. The digest was analyzed by Western blot followed by exposure of the blot to a PhosphorImager screen. Panel A in Fig. 3 is the enhanced chemiluminescence image of the blot immunodetected by the NH2-terminal anti-p40 phox antiserum. Before digestion, p40 phox was present in equal amounts in both the resting complex (lane 1) and the activated complex (lane 2). The resting and activated complexes were then incubated with thrombin (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). An extensive digestion of p40 phox is seen in the resting complex (lane 3) with the appearance of the NH2-terminal 16-kDa moiety of p40 phox . The presence of the COOH-terminal 23-kDa moiety can also be visualized with a COOH-terminal anti-p40 phox antibody (not shown), with a greater amount of the COOH terminus in lane 3than in lane 4. Interestingly, the effect of thrombin on the activated complex is not as extensive (lane 4). For a large part, in the activated complex p40 phox has resisted digestion by thrombin: the NH2-terminal 16-kDa moiety is far less immunodetected, whereas the native 40-kDa protein is more abundant than in the resting complex digest (lane 3). The blot was then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Panel B shows the incorporation of 33Pi in the resting and activated complexes, before and after digestion with thrombin. Surprisingly, the profile of phosphate incorporation is not modified by thrombin digestion (lane 4 versus lane 2). The NH2-terminal 16-kDa and COOH-terminal 23-kDa products immunodetected with the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal anti-p40 phox antisera carry no labeled phosphate. Thus, only nonphosphorylated p40 phox has been digested by thrombin in the resting and activated complexes. This result also explains the extensive digestion of the resting complex versus the activated complex because much more nonphosphorylated p40 phox is present in the resting complex than in the activated complex. We also noted that in vitrophosphorylation of rp40 phox by PKC protected the recombinant protein from digestion by thrombin (not shown). Thus, protection from proteolytic cleavage by thrombin is brought by the addition of phosphate groups on p40 phox alone and does not result from the activation of the other components of the activated complex. We had shown previously that both CKIIα and PKC are able to phosphorylate p40 phox in vitro. This is not surprising because p40 phox holds consensus sites bearing either threonine or serine for both PKC and CKII. We therefore undertook a tryptic peptide mapping of rp40 phox phosphorylated in vitroby either PKC or CKIIα. The aim of this experiment was to assign to the peptide spots from the in vivo phosphorylation map described in a previous section to either a phosphorylation by PKC or by CKIIα, bearing in mind that Thr251, Thr274, and Thr327 are located in consensus sites recognized by both PKC and CKIIα. The tryptic maps illustrated in Figs. 4 A and 5 A were obtained after phosphorylation by CKIIα and PKC, respectively. All phosphorylated spots were eluted from the cellulose plates as described in Ref. 24Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. Only serine residues were phosphorylated in vitro by CKIIα, whereas both threonine and serine residues were phosphorylated by PKC (Figs. 4 B and 5 B). This was confirmed by a direct phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated rp40 phox in both cases. By depositing both samples on the same TLC plate, each phosphorylated spot was well individualized, proving that in vitro PKC and CKII do not phosphorylate the same sites on p40 phox (data not shown). All of these results point to a likely role of PKC in the in vivophosphorylation of p40 phox during superoxide production.Figure 5Tryptic peptide map and phosphoamino acid analysis of p40 phox phosphorylated in vitro by PKC. Recombinant p40 phox was phosphorylatedin vitro by PKC, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After immunodetection with the anti-p40 phox antiserum, the band carrying p40 phox was excised and incubated with trypsin as described. The tryptic peptide map is given in panel A. The arrowed peptides were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis as shown in panel B. The positions of phosphoamino acid standards are indicated on theright.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To ascertain that PKC is involved in p40 phox phosphorylation, we studied the effect of a potent and selective inhibitor of PKCs, GFX, on the two-dimensional profile of p40phox from PMA-activated differentiated HL60 cells. This study was also carried out with human neutrophils isolated from whole blood and activated by PMA. Identical results were obtained with differentiated HL60 cells and human neutrophils. Only the results obtained with neutrophils are presented here. Fig. 6 A gives the 33Pi incorporation profiles of p40phox isolated from the neutrophil lysate by immunoprecipitation. Fig. 6 B gives the corresponding Western blot profiles of p40phox. In resting neutrophils, p40phox was present mainly as three species characterized by pI values of 6.6, 6.3, and 6.1, as was already shown in resting differentiated HL60 cells (1Fuchs A. Bouin A.P. Rabilloud T. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Only the 6.1 species had incorporated labeled phosphate. This suggests that either the 6.3 species has a very low phosphorylation turnover or that its more acidic migration results from a post-translational modification of p40phox different from phosphorylation yet to be defined. Upon activation by PMA, two additional spots with more acidic pI values of 5.8 and 5.9 were revealed by radiolabeling (panel A) and immunodetection (panel B). PMA-induced phosphorylation of p40phox was precluded by pretreatment with GFX and concomitantly oxidase activation was abolished (not shown). The existence of a strong link between the in vivophosphorylation of p40phox and the activity of a PKC type kinase can be inferred from the following: 1) p40phox is phosphorylated upon the addition of PMA, a potent activator of PKC; 2) the phosphorylation of p40phox is strongly inhibited by GFX; and 3) the tryptic map of p40phox phosphorylatedin vitro by PKC is very similar to that obtained after activation-induced in vivo phosphorylation. This very strong correlation prompted us to mutate all consensus PKC sites in p40phox and study the in vitrophosphorylation of these mutants by tryptic peptide mapping. Threonine residues at positions 154, 211, 251, 274, and 327 and Ser315 were mutated into alanine residues to generate the mutants p40-T154A, p40-T211A, p40-T251A, p40-T274A, p40-T315A, and p40-S315A. The directed mutagenesis was performed directly onto the p40phox cDNA cloned in a bacterial expression plasmid. Mutants and wild-type p40phox were expressed as proteins fused to thioredoxin and bearing a polyhistidine tag for easy purification on a nickel affinity column. Fusion proteins were digested with enterokinase to yield the p40phox protein moiety. Afterin vitro phosphorylation by PKC in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. A tryptic map was carried out on each phosphorylated band. Tryptic peptide maps of the p40-T154A, p40-S315A, and p40-T154A/S315A mutants are shown in Fig. 7. The maps of the other threonine mutant forms of p40phox (p40-T211A, p40-T251A, p40-T274A, and p40-T327A) are identical to the wild-type p40phox tryptic map and are not presented. The p40-T154A map shows the most dramatic change of pattern. In particular, the two major spots, namely peptides 1 and 2 indicated byarrows, are absent from this map. It was therefore likely that both major spots containing phosphothreonine were in fact peptides carrying threonine 154. The sequence surrounding Thr154, NH2- … Arg-Thr154-Arg-Lys … -COOH is rich in arginine and lysine residues. The random attack by trypsin at any of these peptide bonds is expected to produce intermediate small peptides (24Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar) such as TR and TRK. The di- and tripeptides TR and TRK synthesized in a phosphorylated form were used as standards in tryptic peptide maps. Comparison of the ninhydrin-stained TLC plates and PhosphorImager images of the same plates showed that the synthetic peptides comigrated with the major radiolabeled spots (Fig. 8), confirming that peptides 1 and 2 correspond to phospho-TRK and phospho-TR respectively.Figure 8Identification of the major spots as phospho-TR and phospho-TRK. A tryptic peptide map of wild-type rp40phox phosphorylated in vitroby PKC was run with 1 μg of the phospho-TR or phospho-TRK synthetic peptide. Ninhydrin staining of the TLC plates is shown underneath the corresponding PhosphorImager images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The p40-S315A mutant map compared with the p40phox wild-type map (Fig. 7) shows that a minor spot has disappeared. This minor spot corresponds to peptide 3 in Fig. 5 and is present in all threonine mutant forms of p40phox. This spot had been identified previously as a phosphoserine-containing peptide (Fig. 5 B). This confirms that PKC phosphorylates p40phox on serine 315. This spot was also present in the tryptic peptide map of in vivo phosphorylated p40phox (Fig. 3, peptide 3). The presence of minor spots in the double mutant p40-T154A/S315A map points to other possible phosphorylated residues on p40phox yet to be identified. In particular, phosphoserine-containing peptides 4 and 6 point to a phosphorylation site on a serine distinct from serine 315 because these spots do not disappear in the p40-S315A tryptic map. This report provides strong evidence that p40phox is phosphorylated by a PKC type kinase during NADPH oxidase activation. In a previous report we had put forward a strong correlation between the phosphorylation state of p40phox and the level of superoxide production in differentiated HL60 cells stimulated by PMA or fMet-Leu-Phe-Lys. Here we show that p40phoxis phosphorylated in an identical manner in human neutrophils stimulated by PMA and that p40phoxphosphorylation and superoxide production are inhibited by GFX, a potent inhibitor of PKCs. Finally, tryptic peptide mapping of in vivo and in vitro phosphorylated p40phox points to a role of a PKC type kinase in the activation-induced phosphorylation of p40phox. The tryptic phosphorylation pattern obtained with differentiated HL60 cells stimulated by PMA is identical to the patterns obtained either with isolated neutrophils stimulated by PMA or with differentiated HL60 cells stimulated by formyl peptide at micromolar concentrations (not shown), suggesting that the activation of the signaling pathway through cell surface receptors activates a PKC-type kinase responsible for p40phoxphosphorylation. Two in vivo phosphorylation sites have been identified on p40phox as being threonine 154 localized 20 residues upstream of the SH3 domain and serine 315 at the COOH terminus of p40phox. Thr154 is in a basic region of p40phoxNH2-Arg-Arg-Leu-Arg-Pro-Arg-Thr154 -Arg-Lys-Val-Lys-COOH which is excessively sensitive to proteolytic cleavage. 7 residues out of the 11 in the above sequence are basic residues. Digestion of p40phox by thrombin cuts the protein at arginine 153 immediately adjacent to the major phosphorylation site at threonine 154. Digestion by endoproteinase-Lys-C cuts the protein in the same region (not shown). This region is adjacent to the SH3 domain of p40phox (residues 175–224). This stretch could therefore act as a very exposed hinge between the NH2terminus and the SH3-containing COOH terminus. The presence of phosphate on Thr154 inhibits the digestion by thrombin at residue Arg153, possibly by steric hindrance. The negative charges brought by the phosphate residue could also trigger a change of conformation of p40phox which could participate in the transition of the cytosolic phox complex from an inactive to an active state. The second phosphorylation site identified on p40phox is serine 315, localized in the COOH terminus of the protein which has been shown to interact with the inter-SH3 domain of p67 phox (6Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Faure J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This second site might therefore play a strategic function in the p40phox/p67 phox interaction. Preliminary results from two hybrid studies appear to indicate that mutagenesis of the serine 315 or threonine 154 to alanine or aspartate did not change the interaction of p40phox with either p47phox or p67 phox (not shown). A more subtle regulation of the spatial and temporal organization of the three phox partners is probably brought by a hierarchy of phosphorylation on Thr154 and Ser315 as well as on other phosphorylation sites yet to be determined. The in vivo and in vitro tryptic phosphorylation maps present phosphorylated peptides that are still present in the tryptic map of the double mutant T154A/S315A. Two of these sites were shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by PKC on serine (peptides 4 and 6). We are now searching for a nonconsensus serine site for PKC on p40phox. We thank Dr. O. Filhol for recombinant CKIIα and Drs. J. Garin and A. Chapel for the synthesis of the phosphodi- and tripeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2066921963,"A number of reports suggest that under different conditions leading to cytoskeleton reorganization the GTPase Rac1 and possibly RhoA are downstream targets of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In order to gain more insight into this particular signaling pathway, we have addressed the question of a possible direct interaction of PI 3-kinase products with the Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Using recombinant proteins, we found that Rac1 and, to a lesser extent, RhoA but not Cdc42 were capable to selectively bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in a mixture of crude brain phosphoinositides. Nucleotide-depleted Rac1 was the most efficient, but the GDP- and GTP-bound forms retained significant PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding activity. This protein-lipid association involved electrostatic as well as hydrophobic interactions, since both phosphate groups located at specific positions of the inositol ring and fatty-acyl chains were absolutely required. Based on the sequence of Rac1, two potential binding sites were identified, one at the C terminus and one in the extra α-helical domain. Deletion of these two domains resulted in a complete loss of binding to PI 3-kinase products. Finally, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 strongly stimulated GDP dissociation from Rac1 in a dose-dependent manner. In agreement, data obtained in intact cells suggest that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 might target Rac1 to peculiar membrane domains, allowing formation of specific clusters containing not only small GTPases but other partners bearing pleckstrin homology domains such as specific exchange factors required for Rac1 and RhoA activation.

Whereas little is known about class II PI 3-kinases, class I enzymes are clearly involved in cell signaling. Although they might be regulated by different mechanisms, they have in common two main features. (i) They are heterodimers containing a regulatory subunit (p85, p55, p50, or p101) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit, at least four isoforms of p110 being characterized so far; (ii) all of them use mainly PtdIns(4)P and PdIns(4,5)P2 as substrates, leading to the formation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, respectively. These two D-3 phosphoinositides accumulate in cells stimulated by various agonists or transformed by oncogenes such as v-src, they are insensitive to phospholipases C, and are considered as potential second messengers (2Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Several recent studies reported a number of signaling proteins able to interact with D-3 phosphoinositides, resulting in their membrane targeting and/or in the modulation of their enzymatic activity. These include nonclassical protein kinase C (2Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar) as well as some proteins bearing Src homology 2 (3Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) or PH domains (2Toker A. Cantley L.C.

Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), the PH domain-containing protein kinase B (or Akt) being of special interest (1Vanhaesebroeck B.

Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). In addition, several lines of evidence previously suggested a possible link between PI 3-kinase and Rac1, a small GTPase of the Rho family (6Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T.

Cell Res. 1997; 234: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These small GTPases are known to regulate the organization of actin cytoskeleton (10Nobes C. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). Interestingly, reorganization of actin cytoskeleton induced by PDGF or insulin is impaired upon inhibition of PI 3-kinase (11Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Moreover, constitutively active mutants of PI 3-kinase α promoted a rearrangement of the actin filament system similar to that observed in response to activated Rac1 or RhoA (12Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that PI 3-kinase increases guanine nucleotide exchange on Rac (6Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 8Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 577-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although regulators of Rho GTPases bearing PH domains may be involved in these effects (13Han J. Lubi-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism by which PI 3-kinase activates in vivo the GDP/GTP exchange on these small G-proteins remains poorly understood. Further evidence for a close relationship between PI 3-kinases or their products and small G-proteins of the Rho family came from in vitro experiments showing, for instance, a binding of PI 3-kinase α to the GTP-bound forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 (14Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). On the other hand, although D-3 phosphoinositides were not specifically considered, their precursor PtdIns(4,5)P2 was proposed to directly stimulate the dissociation of GDP from Cdc42 and possibly RhoA (15Zheng Y. Glaven J.A. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23815-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct interaction of this phosphoinositide with these small G-proteins. Finally, both RhoA and Rac1 were shown to activate a PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase in different models, including platelets (16Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Whether this contributes to the stimulation of PI 3-kinase by RhoA observed in platelet extracts (17Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is presently unknown. In order to gain more insight into the possible role of PI 3-kinase in regulating Rho-GTPases, we have addressed the question of a direct interaction between D-3 phosphoinositides and RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42. Using various assay conditions and recombinant proteins, we found that Rac1 and, to a lesser extent, RhoA were capable to selectively bind to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 via two potential binding sites. In contrast to the interaction observed with PH domains, both the specific positions of the phosphate group on the inositol ring and the fatty-acyl chains were required for this binding. Moreover, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 but not PtdIns(4,5)P2had in vitro a potent GDP-releasing activity on Rac1, suggesting a potential cooperative effect of this phosphoinositide and of exchange factors like Vav (13Han J. Lubi-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) or other regulators. Finally, we provide evidence for a physiologic significance of these results in EGF-stimulated Vero cells. PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, crude brain phosphoinositides, and PS were purchased from Sigma. The diC16-PtdIns(3,4)P2, and diC16-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3were from Matreya, Inc. Ptd[2-3H]Ins(4)P, Ptd[2-3H]Ins(4,5)P2 (1 Ci/mmol), [3H]GDP (12.9 Ci/mmol), [35S]GTPγS (1000 Ci/mmol), and [32P]orthophosphate were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) from NEN Life Science Products (France). The EGF (receptor grade) was obtained from Calbiochem. TLC plates were from Merck. Transformed JM101Escherichia coli containing cDNAs encoding human Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 were generous gifts from Prof. A. Hall (University College, London, United Kingdom). The cDNA encoding the insertion domain deletion mutant of Rac1 protein (18Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. O. Lotan (Sackler Faculty of Medecine, Tel Aviv, Israel) and was expressed in E. coli as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Unless stipulated, all other reagents were from Sigma. Transformed E. coli were grown in Luria-Bertoni medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and induced for 3 h with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Expressed G-proteins of the Rho family were then purified following the protocol described by Self and Hall (19Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); they migrated as single bands at the expected molecular mass on SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE with bovine serum albumin as a standard and staining with a Colloidal Coomassie staining kit (Novex) as described (19Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The quantification was performed by a densitometric analysis (Gel Doc 1000, Molecular Analyst, Bio-Rad). The C-terminal truncation mutant missing the last 33 amino acids (ΔCt Rac1) and the double mutant corresponding to the ΔCt Rac1 lacking the insert region (residues 123–133) (ΔDI-ΔCt Rac1) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using pGEX2T-Rac1 and pGEX2T-ΔDIRac1, respectively, as templates, and synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-CCGGAAACGTCCCGACCG-3′ and 5′-CTCAAGCTTAGAGCGCCGAGCACTCCAGGTA-3′) as primers. The amplified fragments were cleaved with BamHI and HindIII and ligated with pGEXKG vector digested with the same enzymes (20Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). After verifying the DNA sequences, the GST fusion proteins (ΔCt Rac1 and ΔDI-ΔCt Rac1) were expressed and purified from transformed E. coli (XL1Blue) as described above; they migrated as single band at the expected size on SDS-PAGE. The different phosphoinositides (40 μg) were mixed with PS (80 μg), dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4 (1 μg of phosphoinositides/μl), vortexed and sonicated (20 kHz for 3 × 10 s). Lipid vesicles were then incubated with immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase for 30 min at 37 °C as described previously (21Payrastre B. Gironcel D. Plantavid M. Mauco G. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v), and lipids were immediately extracted by an acidic Bligh and Dyer extraction procedure (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (41842) Google Scholar). This reaction allowed us to obtain about 2% of D-3 phosphoinositideversus precursor. Lipids were then dried under nitrogen for 40 min at 37 °C and resuspended in suitable buffers for further experiments. In some experiments, lipids were deacylated by incubation in methylamine/methanol/n-butanol (25/45.7/11.4, v/v) for 50 min at 53 °C (23Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in appropriate buffers. Proteins were resuspended in the electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated by 10–15% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Gelman Sciences), and incubated three times for 1 h in the saturation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 1% milk powder (w/v). Radiolabeled D-3 phosphorylated inositol lipids were prepared as described above (except that in some experiments PS were omitted). They were either TLC-purified or directly used, dried under a nitrogen stream, and sonicated (20 kHz for 2 × 30 s) in the overlay assay buffer (OAB: 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 12 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. The nitrocellulose was then incubated 4 h at room temperature with phospholipids (100,000–150,000 dpm/ml). Unbound lipids and nonspecific binding were removed by successive washes: 1) five 30-min washes in OAB; 2) one 1-h wash in OAB supplemented with 1m final NaCl; 3) one 30-min wash in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20; 4) three more times, for 30 min each, in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3% Triton X-100 successively. The radioactive spots were visualized by a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) or autoradiography. Radiolabeled phosphoinositides were prepared as indicated above, resuspended and sonicated in HNE buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). HNE buffer supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was added to obtain a final concentration of 0.02% Nonidet P-40, as described previously (3Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins (about 15 μg) were washed twice with HNE buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in 30 μl of the same buffer. Then 30 μl of radiolabeled phosphoinositides were added to the fusion protein suspension. After 40 min of incubation at room temperature, the beads were quickly washed twice with 1 ml of HNE supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The remaining radioactivity associated with the beads was counted by scintillation (TRI-CARB, 1900 TR, Packard) and specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific interaction with GST alone (5–10%). For the lipid selectivity experiments, bound lipids were extracted following a Bligh and Dyer modified procedure and resolved by TLC using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (80/30/26/24/14, v/v) as a solvent. For experiments performed with physiological concentrations of divalent cations, radiolabeled phosphoinositides were resuspended and sonicated in 10 mmHepes, pH 7.0. The GST fusion proteins were washed twice with saline buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 7 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.466 mm CaCl2, 2.1 mm MgCl2) (4Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Edvard Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 30 μl of 2× saline buffer. Then 30 μl of radiolabeled phosphoinositides were added to the fusion proteins. After 40 min of incubation at room temperature, the beads were quickly washed successively with 1 ml of saline buffer, 1 ml of saline buffer containing 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 1 ml of saline buffer containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and finally 1 ml of saline buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40. The remaining radioactivity associated to the beads was analyzed as described above. Proteins were first depleted of nucleotide for 15 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl. When indicated, loading was started with GDP or GTP (100 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C under gentle agitation, and stopped by adding MgCl2 at a final concentration of 1 mm. Binding with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was carried out in HNE buffer as described above, except that 1 mm MgCl2 was maintained during the time course of the experiment, accordingly the GTPases were in the expected forms (GDP- or GTP-bound, or nucleotide-free). For the determination of the dissociation constant, in vitrosynthesized [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 was first TLC-purified and mixed with adequate amounts of unlabeled diC16-PtdIns(3,4)P2 (about 100 dpm/pmol), dried under nitrogen at 37 °C for 40 min, and resuspended in HNE buffer as described above. The concentration of diC16-PtdIns(3,4)P2was always assessed by phosphorus determination (24Böttcher C.J.F. Van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Clin. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (843) Google Scholar) and the purity of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 by high performance liquid chromatography analysis (21Payrastre B. Gironcel D. Plantavid M. Mauco G. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The effect of phosphoinositides on the dissociation of [3H]GDP from purified bacterial Rho family G-proteins were examined by loading the latter (about 5 μg) with 10 μm [3H]GDP (12.9 Ci/mmol) for 15 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (final volume 60 μl). Loading was stopped by adding MgCl2 at 2.5 mm final (2 mmfree Mg2+). Then, 4 μl of [3H]GDP-loaded proteins were incubated with 16 μl of buffer mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and various lipids at different concentrations, for the indicated times at room temperature. Assays were stopped by dilution into 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 and were immediately filtered on 25-mm HAWP nitrocellulose filters (Millipore). Filters were washed three times with 2 ml of the same buffer and dried, and their radioactivity was counted. The African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) were seeded in 175-cm2 culture dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (25Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) to about 80% confluence and serum-starved for 16 h. When indicated, wortmannin (100 nm) was added 20 min before stimulation with EGF (100 ng/ml for 15 min). Cells were then scraped off the culture dishes, harvested in 800 μl of extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were first centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min to remove nuclei and debris and then for 30 min at 120,000 × gto obtain the total membranes and the cytosolic fraction. Membranes were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g to eliminate unsolubilized material. Protein concentration was determined using the micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Eighty μg of proteins were resuspended in sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Gelman Sciences) as reported previously (26Giuriato S. Payrastre B. Drayer A.L. Plantavid M. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. Chap H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed with the monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), and the reaction was visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The various bands were quantified by a densitometric analysis measuring the pixel volume in each area (Gel Doc 1000, Bio-Rad). Extraction and quantification of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 and [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 produced upon EGF stimulation of Vero cells were performed as described previously (25Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Serum-starved Vero cells were washed once with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and labeled for 5 h in the same buffer supplemented with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were then stimulated for 15 min with 100 ng/ml EGF and lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmPMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, the soluble fraction was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of a specific anti-Rac1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). The immune complexes were collected with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed eight times with the washing buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.005% SDS, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). GDP and GTP were finally eluted in elution buffer (5 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 0.25 mm GDP, and 0.25 mm GTP) at 68 °C for 20 min, separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Schleicher & Schüll), and developed in 1.2 m ammonium formate, 0.8m HCl as described (28Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Science. 1990; 346: 719-723Google Scholar). Fixed [32P]GDP and [32P]GTP were quantified with the PhosphorImager 445 SI. GST-RhoA, -Rac1, or -Cdc42 fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated in HNE buffer with PS (66.7%) vesicles containing either [32P]PtdIns(3)P, [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2, or [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (0.3%) and their respective precursor (33%) in the presence of 0.02% Nonidet P-40 as described elsewhere (3Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that, under these conditions, PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3were both able to interact with RhoA and Rac1 but not with Cdc42, whereas PtdIns(3)P appeared as a poor ligand for these small G-proteins. An overlay binding assay using either GST-RhoA, GST-Rac1, or GST-Cdc42 and [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 confirmed that RhoA and Rac1, but not Cdc42 could bind to this inositol lipid (Fig. 1 B). The same results were obtained with [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but, again, [32P]PtdIns(3)P did not interact (data not shown). Since divalent cations may modify intermolecular interactions, lipid binding assay to immobilized recombinant proteins was performed in a buffer containing physiological concentrations of divalent cations and lacking detergent (Fig. 1 C). Although the binding efficiency was reduced, very similar results were obtained. In addition, in agreement with Zheng et al. (15Zheng Y. Glaven J.A. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23815-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we found that [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 interacted significantly with Cdc42. Fig. 1 C also shows that PtdIns(4,5)P2 was the phosphoinositide preferentially interacting with Cdc42 under our conditions, whereas its binding to RhoA and Rac1 was less efficient compared with PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Finally, none of the proteins interacted significantly with PtdIns(4)P (Fig. 1 C) or PtdIns (data not shown). To reveal a specific PI 3-kinase product that would preferentially associate with these small G-proteins, we have incubated a mixture of all 32P-labeled D-3 phosphoinositides in the presence of a large excess of crude brain phosphoinositides used as precursors. Both in HNE buffer (Fig. 2 A) or in the presence of physiological concentrations of divalent cations and without detergent (Fig. 2 B), [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 selectively associated with GST-Rac1 and GST-RhoA, although the binding to RhoA was weaker. [32P]PtdIns(3)P did not bind and [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 was much less efficient than [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in binding to these small G-proteins, indicating a preferential interaction with the latter lipid. Again, GST alone or GST-Cdc42 were unable to interact with PI 3-kinase products. In agreement with these data, diC16-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was the most efficient phosphoinositide able to compete for binding of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to Rac1 (data not shown).

Using a highly specific polyclonal antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide of the human dCK, we analyzed its subcellular localization by Western blots of biochemically fractionated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions as well as by in situ immunochemistry. Native dCK was found to be located mainly in the cytoplasm in several cell types, and the enzyme was more concentrated in the perinuclear and cellular membrane area. In contrast, when dCK was overexpressed in the cells, it was mainly located in the nucleus. The results demonstrate that native dCK is a cytoplasmic enzyme. However, it has the ability to enter the nucleus under certain conditions, suggesting the existence of a cytoplasmic retention mechanism that may have an important function in the regulation of the deoxynucleoside salvage pathway.

Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK)1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of 2′-deoxycytidine to its monophosphate form, which is a rate-limiting reaction of the deoxynucleoside salvage pathway (1Bohman C.

Studies with purified human enzyme have demonstrated that dCK has a broad substrate specificity using both purine and pyrimidine deoxynucleoside substrates (2Arner E.S.J. Eriksson S.

Impaired dCK expression or activity in cells usually leads to resistance for these drugs, indicating that dCK plays key role in their metabolism and pharmacological activities (8Ullman B. Coons T.

For these reasons, elucidation of potential regulatory mechanisms playing a role in dCK activation is of particular interest. Although much is known about the biochemical properties of dCK both in vitro and in vivo, little information is available on its regulation at the transcriptional or posttranslational levels. The constant amounts of dCK protein throughout the cell cycle suggest that its expression is not cell cycle-regulated (1Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochem. (Life Sci. Adv.). 1990; 9: 11-35Google Scholar, 11Richel D.J. Colly L.P. Arentsen-Honders M.W. Starrenburg C.W.J. Wilemze R. Leuk. Res. 1990; 14: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). On the other hand, dCK is expressed predominantly in lymphoid cells, which indicates cell type-specific regulation (12Chottiner E.G. Shewach D.S. Datta N.S. Ashcraft E. Gribbin D. Ginsburg D. Fox I.H. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1531-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Song J.J. Walker S. Chen E. Johnson E.E. Spychala J. Gribbin T. Mitchell B.S.

In addition, dCK expression is up-regulated in certain solid tumors (16Spasokukotskaja T. Arner E.S.J. Brosjo O. Gunven P. Juliusson G. Liliemark J. Eriksson S. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31: 202-208Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism that leads to tissue-specific and proliferation-dependent transcription of dCK is not yet clear. Another level of control would involve regulated changes in the subcellular location of the enzyme. This assumption gained ground by the recent unexpected finding that a transfected dCK-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was located mainly in the nucleus, contrasting with previous descriptions of dCK as a “cytoplasmic” protein (17Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This finding may have important implications for the regulation of the deoxynucleotide metabolism, especially with respect to the functional compartmentalization of the dNTP pools. The determination of the actual location of native dCK is therefore of paramount interest. In this paper we examined the intracellular localization of dCK in several cell types under physiological conditions. Using a highly specific C-terminal peptide antibody, we provide evidence that dCK is normally located in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, when dCK is overexpressed, it is found mainly in the nucleus, suggesting that a cytoplasmic retention regulatory mechanism may be functioning in living cells. A peptide (NH2-YESLVEKVKEFLSTL-COOH) was synthesized that corresponded to amino acids 246–260 of the human dCK protein (12Chottiner E.G. Shewach D.S. Datta N.S. Ashcraft E. Gribbin D. Ginsburg D.

New Zealand White rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 0.1 mg of linked peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted five times with 0.04 mg of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 2-week intervals. Antisera were collected and tested in Western blots containing various amounts of purified recombinant His-tagged human dCK (15Karlsson A. Johansson M. Eriksson S. J. Biol.

For immunoblot analysis, proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the dCK-pep antibody at 1:5000 dilution, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories). Immuncomplexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The polyclonal antiserum for the P1 protein (TSG23, a kind gift from C. Hoog, Karolinska Institute) and the monoclonal antibody for the myc epitope (9E10 hybridoma, kindly provided by N. T. Ktistakis, Babraham Institute) were used at 1:4000 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. Preparations of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were carried out essentially as described (19Johnson D.R. Levanat S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar), with some minor modifications. Briefly, 1–5 × 107 cells were resuspended in isoosmotic lysis buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 3 mmCaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were supplemented with 0.22 volume of cytoplasmic extraction buffer containing 0.15 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.7 m KCl, and 0.015 m MgCl2. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the resulting supernatants were supplemented with glycerol to 25% and stored at −70 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed once in isoosmotic lysis buffer lacking Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a modified electrophoresis sample buffer containing 22% glycerol, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5 mm MgCl2, and 75 units/ml Benzonase (Nicomed Pharma A/S). Before loading on the gel, samples were diluted with an equal volume of sample buffer without MgCl2 and Benszonase. 100 μl (50% suspension) of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads were incubated with dCK-pep antiserum or preimmune serum (100 μl of antiserum/mg of dry gel) for 1 h at 4 °C, in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The beads were washed with excess buffer and incubated with crude extracts from 5 × 107 CCRF-CEM cells for 1 h. At the end of incubation, the beads were removed by centrifugation, and deoxycytidine kinase and thymidine kinase activities of the resulting supernatants were measured by the DEAE-cellulose filter binding assay as described previously (16Spasokukotskaja T.

A2780, HeLa, and CCRF-CEM cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The pCMV-myc-dCK expression vector was constructed by ligation of the blunt-ended NcoI-BamHI fragment from pET9d-dCK (15Karlsson A. Johansson M. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24374-24378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the blunt-ended EcoRI site of the pCMV-myc plasmid (Stratagene). The resulting construct contains the full-length human dCK cDNA in frame with the 10-amino acid-long myc epitope under the control of the strong cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. This construct was used to transfect CCRF-CEM cells by the Lipofectin method (Life Technologies, Inc.) or A2780 and HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (21Ktistaki E.

Transfected and untransfected cells as well as freshly isolated mouse thymocytes and splenocytes were transfered onto glass coverslips precoated with 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine and left to attach for 30 min. Nonattached cells were removed by washing the coverslips with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before fixation. Cells on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 20 min with 3.7% formalin. After fixation the coverslips were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA/PBS). dCK-pep, myc-tag, and Sp1 ((Pep2)-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were diluted 1:200, 1:20, and 1:150, respectively, in BSA/PBS and applied to the cells for 4 h. After washing with BSA/PBS, the cells were incubated with diluted (1:100) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies to IgG (Pierce) for 30 min, washed with BSA/PBS, rinsed in water, and mounted on glass slides with Mowiol (Polysciences) as described previously (21Ktistaki E.

We have raised polyclonal antibodies against a 15-amino acid-long peptide corresponding to the very C-terminal region of human dCK. Purified recombinant human dCK, as well as crude extracts from CCRF-CEM cells and the araC-resistant cell line CEM− (AraC-8D (10Hershfield M.S. Fetter J.E. Small W.C. Bagnara A.S. Williams S.R. Ullman B. Martin Jr., D.W. Wasson D.B. Carson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6380-6386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were analyzed in Western blots using this antibody. The antibody readily reacted with recombinant dCK and with one single species of CCRF-CEM proteins, which had a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa (Fig. 1, A and B). This band was missing in extracts prepared from the dCK-deficient CEM− cell line (Fig. 1 B). Although smaller antibody dilutions or longer exposure times revealed some small background reactivity, the 30-kDa band was always predominant. These results demonstrate that the antibody is highly specific for dCK. Further evidence for the specificity was provided by dCK activity measurements in CCRF-CEM crude extracts. When these extracts were preincubated with dCK-pep antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose,in vitro phosphorylation of deoxycytidine was greatly reduced, whereas phosphorylation of thymidine was not affected (Fig. 1 C). To study the intracellular localization of dCK, we first performed biochemical fractionation of cytoplasms and nuclei from three cell types of different origin, such as the human malignant T lymphoblastoid leukemia (CCRF-CEM), human ovarian carcinoma (A2780), and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell lines. We used an isoosmotic/Nonidet P-40 lysis procedure (19Johnson D.R. Levanat S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar) as an alternative to the commonly used hypotonic/Nonidet P-40 method to isolate intact nuclei and accurately compare the nuclear and cytoplasmic contents of dCK. Immunoblot analysis of these extracts showed that the bulk of cellular dCK protein was in the cytoplasmic fractions, whereas nuclei contained only a minor portion of the protein (Fig. 2 A). To exclude the possibility of potential leakage of dCK from the nuclei to the cytoplasm during the fractionation procedure, we examined the distribution of the nuclear protein P1. P1 is a 105-kDa protein that is present only in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle in mammalian cells (23Starborg M. Brundell E. Gell K. Larsson C. White I. Daneholt B. Hoog C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar). We chose as a control P1 because it is a “free-floating” protein, not associated tightly with chromatin or structural components of the nucleus, making it a reliable marker for assaying nuclear protein leakage (23Starborg M. Brundell E. Gell K. Larsson C. White I. Daneholt B. Hoog C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar). Two strong bands at ∼105 kDa were detected in the nuclear fraction of A2780 cells with P1 antiserum (Fig. 2 B). Only trace amounts of these bands were seen in the cytoplasmic fractions, together with some smaller cross-reactive species (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the integrity of nuclei during the fractionation procedure has been preserved to a high degree. The above results suggest that dCK is a cytoplasmic protein. This is in contradiction with the findings of a previous study using a dCK-GFP fusion protein, which was located mainly in the nucleus (17Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One possible reason for this discrepancy could be that when dCK is artificially overexpressed, its localization may be altered compared with its localization in cells expressing physiological levels of the protein. To test this possibility we have transiently transfected CCRF-CEM, A2780, and HeLa cells with an expression vector containing the human dCK cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter. We also fused a short, 10-amino acid-long myc-tag sequence to the N terminus of the dCK cDNA to follow the expression of the transgene-derived, overexpressed protein independently of its endogenous counterpart. Western blot analysis using an antibody recognizing the myc epitope showed mainly nuclear localization of the overexpressed protein supplied in trans by the expression vector (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, it seems likely that the nuclear localization of dCK observed by the dCK-GFP fusion protein (17Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) is attributable to its overexpression in the cells. To verify these findings in situ, we performed indirect immunofluorescence experiments with the above cell lines, as well as with primary lymphocytes from mouse thymus and spleen. A ring-like peripheral staining pattern characteristic of the thin cytoplasmic region of lymphoid cells was observed in CCRF-CEM cells, splenocytes, and thymocytes with the dCK-pep antiserum (Fig. 3, A, D, and E). Strong cytoplasmic but not nuclear staining was seen in A2780 and HeLa cells (Fig. 3, B and C). In these latter two cell types, especially in cells where as a consequence of less intense staining the resolution was relatively higher, an uneven cytoplasmic distribution of dCK was observed. dCK was mainly accumulated in the cytoplasmic membrane and perinuclear areas, locations that may relate to distinct functional compartments for deoxynucleoside metabolism. The specificity of the signal was verified by the lack of immunoreactivity when the antibody was applied to the cells in the presence of excess purified recombinant dCK protein (Fig. 3 F). In situ localization of the overexpressed dCK was analyzed by immunostaining of transfected cells with myc-tag antibody. The transgene-derived, overexpressed enzyme was found almost exclusively in the nucleus in all three cell lines, as evidenced by the similar staining pattern obtained by the myc-tag antibody (Fig. 4, A–C) and the control antibody recognizing the nuclear protein Sp-1 (Fig. 4,D–F). The same distribution was observed when the cells were transfected with an untagged expression vector and stained with dCK-pep antibody (data not shown), excluding the possibility of artificial translocation of dCK from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as a result of the short myc epitope at the N terminus of the protein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the nuclear localization of dCK in tranfected cells is a consequence of its highly elevated intracellular levels. In mammalian cells deoxyribonucleotides for nuclear DNA replication and repair are synthesized via the de novopathway, which involves reduction of ribonucleotide diphosphates by ribonucleotide reductase, or via direct phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides imported from the extracellular space or derived from dephosphorylation of dNTPs (24Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Earlier studies trying to explain the functional link between dNTP precursor metabolism and DNA replication processes showed a physical association of DNA polymerase α, with several key enzymes involved deoxynucleotide metabolism (25Reddy G.P.V. Pardee A.B. Nature. 1983; 303: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The “replitase model” has since been challenged by several observations, such as the findings that the enzymes thought to be components of the multienzyme complex were localized in different cellular compartments (26Engstrom Y. Rozell B. Hanson H.A. Stemme S. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Engstrom Y. Rozell B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of kinetic isotope incorporation experiments argue against the direct channeling of precursors to the sites of DNA replication (28Bianchi V. Borella S. Rampazzo C. Ferraro P. Calderazzo F. Bianchi L.C. Skog S. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16118-16124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies led to the prevailing view that dNTPs are synthesized in the cytoplasm and subsequently translocate to the nucleus to participate in DNA replication or repair. The recent finding that a GFP-dCK fusion protein was located in the nucleus raised a potentially interesting exception to the above rule (17Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that native dCK is an exclusively nuclear protein generates a number of questions. Although this location would favor the direct supply of dCTP for DNA replication, it is difficult to explain certain results from kinetic isotope incorporation experiments. These studies showed the existence of two dCTP pools: one labeled mainly via the de novo pathway and used directly for DNA replication, and the other labeled via the salvage pathway and preferentially used for liponucleotide synthesis (29Spyrou G. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Spyrou G. Reichard P. J. Biol.

Commun. 1991; 174: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This second “cytoplasmic” dCTP pool is in rapid equilibrium with the one arising from the de novo synthesis and can be used for DNA synthesis efficiently (28Bianchi V. Borella S. Rampazzo C. Ferraro P. Calderazzo F. Bianchi L.C. Skog S. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16118-16124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Spyrou G. Reichard P. J. Biol.

Commun. 1991; 174: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is, however, difficult to explain why the de novo pool, which is the primary source of nuclear DNA synthesis precursors, is built up by cytoplasmic enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase, whereas the salvage pool, which has to equilibrate first with the de novo pool to be used for DNA synthesis, would be synthesized by an enzyme located in the nucleus. In addition, a nuclear dCK as a rate-limiting enzyme for the dCTP supply of liponucleotides is not compatible with the rapid labeling of these phospholipid precursors from deoxycytidine (29Spyrou G. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Spyrou G. Reichard P. J. Biol.

Commun. 1991; 174: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), even if one takes into account a free passage of dCTP across the nuclear membrane. The results presented in this paper clearly establish that native dCK is mainly located in the cytoplasm, a location more consistent with the previously mentioned metabolic studies. This conclusion is based on two independent approaches using biochemical cell fractionation and in situ immunochemistry experiments. A cytoplasmic localization was seen in three cell lines of different origin, as well as in primary thymocytes and splenocytes. In adherent cells, such as A2780 and HeLa, where the intracytoplasmic distribution is better resolved, we noticed denser staining of the cytoplasmic membrane and the perinuclear area. It is tempting to speculate that this uneven distribution of dCK may be of functional relevance, corresponding to a compartmentalization that is related to the dCTP supplies for membrane phospholipid precursor synthesis and DNA replication, respectively. Alternatively, these sites may represent independent compartments for the phosphorylation of exogenous deoxycytidine immediately after its transport into the cell and deoxycytidine derived from endogenous dCTP breakdown, respectively. To resolve the contradiction between the localization of the GFP-dCK fusion protein (17Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the localization of the endogenous native protein, we asked whether the nuclear location of the former is attributable to its overexpression in the cells. We found that this is indeed the case, because after transfection of an expression vector coding for human dCK, which results in higher intracellular concentrations of dCK by several orders of magnitude, the overexpressed protein was mainly localized in the nucleus in all cell types tested. This finding strongly suggests that dCK has the ability to enter the nucleus. Further evidence for this notion was provided by the identification of a consensus nuclear import sequence at the N terminus of the protein, the mutation of which prevents nuclear entry even of the overexpressed GFP-dCK fusion protein (17Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Taking these findings together, we propose a cytoplasmic retention mechanism for dCK, which may involve the action of another protein complexed with dCK, that keeps it in the cytoplasm. When dCK is overexpressed, because of the limiting amounts of the cytoplasmic retention partner, the majority of dCK molecules will contain an accessible NLS sequence for recognition by the nuclear transport machinery. An analogous situation has been described for nuclear factor κB (33Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 34Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), the regulation of which involves cytokine-induced phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic retention partner, IκB, which leads to the dissociation of the nuclear factor κB/IκB complex and the translocation of active nuclear factor κB subunits into the nucleus. An alternative model would involve posttranslational modification of dCK itself, which may be required for nuclear entry in analogy to the transcription factors involved in the interferon signaling pathways (35Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). Although at this point the actual mechanism that retains dCK in the cytoplasm is not known, our results raise the interesting possibility that under certain physiological conditions transport of dCK between subcellular compartments may play an important role in the regulation of its known function in the supply of deoxynucleotides for different biological processes or for unknown additional functions of the protein. We are indebted to Dr. C. Hoog, Dr. N. T. Ktistakis, and Dr. G. J. Peters for the P1 antiserum, the 9E10 hybridoma, and the CEM-dCK− cell line, respectively. We are also grateful to E.

https://openalex.org/W2048731323,"Brown adipose tissue hyperplasia is a fundamental response to low ambient temperature. We show here that cold exposure of an animal markedly increased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/p44) Erk1 and Erk2 in brown adipose tissue, and protected cells in the tissue from apoptosis. We also show that cessation of the sympathetic stimulus, by transferring cold-adapted animals to 28 °C, caused an increased rate of apoptosis in the tissue. In primary cultures of brown adipose tissue, norepinephrine (NE) stimulated both the phosphorylation and the activity of Erk1/2 via the Erk kinase MEK, and protected the cells form apoptosis. Similarly, agonist stimulation of α1- and β-adrenergic receptors and increases in the intracellular level of Ca2+and cAMP stimulated the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Agonist stimulation of α1- and β-adrenergic receptors, and increased intracellular cAMP level also promoted the cell survival. Furthermore, NE stimulated the expression and secretion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which further promoted the cell survival via MEK-dependent activation of Erk1/2. In essence, we show that Erk1/2 has a critical role in promoting NE- and bFGF-dependent survival of brown adipocytes, and propose that NE- and bFGF-dependent regulation of the cell survival is involved in the cold-induced hyperplasia of brown adipose tissue."

ATP plays an important role as an extracellular agonist that mediates its various effects by acting on specific membrane P2 receptor subtypes (1Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 541-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Weisman G.A. Turner J.T. Fedan J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). P2 receptors comprise receptors of the ligand-gated ion channel type, as well as of the G-protein-linked superfamily, termed P2X and P2Y, respectively (3Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). At present, seven genes for P2X receptors have been cloned (4Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A.

Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), but their physiological significance has not been fully established yet. One of the most recently cloned P2X receptors (the P2X7) has a pharmacological profile typical of the receptor previously termed P2Z (9Nuttle L.C. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13988-13996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the photoactivable analog of ATP, Bz-ATP,1 the most potent agonist. The P2Z receptor induces the formation of pores when exposed to concentrations of extracellular ATP in the 100 μm to 1 mm range (Refs. 10El-Moatassim C. Mani J.C. Dornand J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 181: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11González F.A. Ahmed A.H. Lustig K.D. Erb L. Weisman G.A. J. Cell.

Physiol. 1997; 498: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to other P2X receptors, the P2X7receptor has a long COOH-terminal intracellular chain, which is by itself not responsible for the lytic properties of this receptor (14Petrou S. Ugur M. Drummond R.M. Singer J.J. Walsh Jr., J.V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but probably induces the formation of a second messenger involved in the lysis (12Coutinho-Silva R. Persechini P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1793-C1800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the P2X7(P2Z)-receptors share with the other P2X receptors the ability to open a non-selective channel and with P2Z receptors the induction of cell lysis by repeated applications of the agonist (8Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Since the pioneering work of Gallacher (15Gallacher D.V. Nature. 1982; 296: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), ATP has been recognized as a major non-adrenergic non-cholinergic stimulus of saliva secretion. Salivation, like other exocrine secretions, occurs in two steps; (a) acinar cells secrete an isotonic plasma-like fluid, and (b) the electrolyte composition of this primary secretion is modified during its transfer to the mouth by the ductal tree (16Thayssen J.H. Thorn N.A. Schwartz I.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1954; 178: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The ducts reabsorb Na+ and Cl− and secrete K+ and HCO3− (17Lau K.R. Howorth A.J. Case R.M. J. Physiol. 1990; 425: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The study of these two phases of the secretory process has been facilitated by the description of an improved technique to separate ducts and acini (18Amsallem H. Métioui M. VandenAbeele A. Elyamani A. Moran A. Dehaye J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1546-C1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It could be observed that extracellular ATP increased the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]i) both in rat submandibular gland (RSMG) acini and ducts. This result suggested that ATP might regulate both phases of secretion. In acini, ATP increased the intracellular concentration of Na+ (19Hurley T.W. Ryan M.P. Moore W.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), activated the Na+/H+ exchanger, and opened a chloride channel (20Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 319-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It also inhibited the response to agonists activating the l-α-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-selective phospholipase C (21Métioui M. Amsallem H. Alzola E. Chaı̈b N. Elyamani A. Moran A. Marino A. Dehaye J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Two purinergic responses were reported in pure RSMG ducts. At low concentrations, ATP activated a P2Y1 receptor, while at high concentrations, it stimulated a P2X receptor (18Amsallem H. Métioui M. VandenAbeele A. Elyamani A. Moran A. Dehaye J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1546-C1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Park M.K. Garrad R.C. Weisman G.A. Turner J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1388-C1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ionotropic receptor triggered the secretion of kallikrein. The molecular characterization of the ionotropic receptor present on RSMG ductal cells has not been achieved yet. Both P2X4 and P2X7 transcripts have been observed in rat submandibular glands (23Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Camden J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1100-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, according to Buellet al. (6Buell G. Lewis C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), P2X4 are expressed in RSMG acini but not in RSMG ducts. It can thus be speculated that the P2X receptors expressed in ducts are of the P2X7 type. The functional consequences of the activation of this receptor have not been determined. The coupling of some P2Y receptors to phospholipases C and phospholipases A2 has been clearly established (24Okajima F. Sato K. Nazarea M. Sho K. Kondo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13029-13037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gupta S.K. Diez E. Heasley L.E. Osawa S. Johnson G.L.

Reports on the regulation of the activity of phospholipases by P2X receptors are more scarce (27El-Moatassim C. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23664-23673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Purkiss J. Owen P.J. Jones J.A. Boarder M.R. Biochem.

The purpose of this work was to study the contribution of ionotropic purinergic receptors to the release of arachidonic acid by RSMG ductal cells. The phospholipases A2 involved in this response and their role in the secretion in response to purines were also explored. Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 2-Methylthioadenosine 5′-triphosphate (2-MeSATP) was purchased from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Collagenase P, bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V), Coomassie Brilliant Blue, adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP, sodium salt), and ATPγS were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). 2,3-Dialdehyde ATP (periodate-oxidized ATP), Bz-ATP, thapsigargin, A23187, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA),Nα-benzoyl-dl-argininep-nitroanilide, HEPES, EGTA, DNase I (from bovine pancreas), digitonin, carbamylcholine chloride, epinephrine, isoproterenol, ionomycin, phospholipid, neutral lipid and fatty acid standards, and the other purines and ATP analogues were obtained from Sigma. Arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone (AACOCF3), 2-(p-amylcinnamoyl)amino-4-chlorobenzoic acid (ONO-RS-082), and suramin were supplied by Alexis Biochemicals (Woburn, MA) and (E)-6-(bromoethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (bromoenol lactone, BEL) by Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). [methyl-14C]Choline chloride (200 μCi/ml, 55 mCi/mmol) and myo-[2-3H]inositol (1 mCi/ml, 18.3 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, UK) and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (0.1 mCi/ml, 60–100 Ci/mmol) from NEN Life Science Products (Bruxelles, Belgium). Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Barcelona, Spain), and GStract™ RNA isolation kit II was from Maxim Biotech, Inc. Percoll was obtained from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden) and the amino acid mixture (without glutamine) from Life Technologies, Inc. (Uxbridge, UK). Analytical grade anion exchange resin AG® 1-X8 was obtained from Bio-Rad. Silica Gel-60 F254 plates were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The other materials were purchased from various sources and were reagent grade. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) fed ad libitum and given free access to water were used. The rats were killed by exposure to diethylether, and the glands were immediately dissected and finely minced. The suspension of ductal cells was prepared as described previously (18Amsallem H. Métioui M. VandenAbeele A. Elyamani A. Moran A. Dehaye J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1546-C1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the minced glands of one rat were digested in the presence of 2.6 mg of collagenase P (1.52 units/mg) for 20 min at 37 °C under constant shaking (90 cycles/min) in 10 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing (mM): 24.5 HEPES, 96 NaCl, 6 KCl, 2.5 NaH2PO4, 11.5 glucose, 5 pyruvate, 5 glutamate, 5 fumarate, 1% (v/v) glutamine-free amino acid mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.125% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Ten minutes after the beginning of the digestion and at the end of the digestion, the cells were aspirated several times with 10-, 5-, and 2-ml glass pipettes. The suspension was then washed three times with an isotonic saline solution, resuspended in 10 ml of collagenase-free HBS and incubated for 10 min in the presence of 0.06 mg of DNase I (420 units/mg). The crude suspension was pipetted again, filtered through a nylon mesh and washed five times in a saline solution. Cells were resuspended in 4 ml of HBS and distributed in two tubes containing 6 ml of an isotonic Percoll solution (40%). The tubes were centrifuged at 4,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. At the end of the centrifugation, one population of cells had sedimented while the other had remained on the top of the Percoll. The microscopic examination revealed that the upper band was a ductal suspension while acini had sedimented through the Percoll. The protein content of the ductal suspension was 3.6 ± 0.6 mg/pair of glands (n = 10) measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using γ-globulin as standard. The assay of kallikrein (a ductal marker) confirmed that the upper layer was enriched 4.4-fold in kallikrein activity with respect to the crude cellular suspension. Ducts were aspirated, washed, and resuspended in HBS buffer for further experiments. The ducts from two glands of one rat were resuspended in 1 ml of HBS in the presence of 0.5 mmCaCl2. Three μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) were added, and the suspension was incubated at 25 °C with gentle shaking. At various times, 50-μl aliquots were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 1 min. The pellet was washed with 0.9% NaCl, the lipids were extracted, and the incorporation of [3H]AA was estimated. Labeling was very rapid, and steady state was reached after approximately 60 min. At that time, 80 ± 3% of the total cellular precursor was incorporated into the lipidic fraction. Most of this radioactivity was distributed among various phospholipids; phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol + phosphatidyl serine incorporated, respectively, 46 ± 1%, 18.8 ± 0.3%, and 5 ± 1% of the total lipidic fraction. To study the metabolism of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidyl inositol, ductal cells from 1 or 3 rats, respectively, were incubated for 90 min as described above in 1 ml of HBS containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 4 μCi/ml [methyl-14C]choline or 25 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol. At the end of the isotopic labeling, ductal cells were washed and incubated for 1 h in 6 ml of calcium-free HBS in the absence of the tracer. After this incubation, the ducts were washed again and resuspended in 6 ml of calcium-free HBS. Assays were performed at 37 °C under constant shaking and started by adding 100 μl of cell suspension to 400 μl of HBS containing CaCl2 (final concentration 0.5 mm) and the agonists. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation for 30 s at 10,000 × g. Four hundred μl of the supernatants were transferred to vials and mixed with 4 ml of scintillation mixture. Radioactivity of the samples was measured in a scintillation spectrometer (model 2000 CA, Tri-Carb, Packard). In order to estimate the radioactivity already present in the medium at the start of each assay, several samples of the cellular suspension were taken during the experiments, mixed with 400 μl of HBS, and directly centrifuged, and the radioactivity present in the supernatant was counted. These results were used as blank values and used to estimate the release of [3H]AA during the incubation at 37 °C. Under these assay conditions, 1 mmATP or 100 μm Bz-ATP promoted the release up to 8 ± 1% (n = 10) and 14 ± 3% (n = 10), respectively, of the incorporated isotope after 20 min of stimulation. In order to characterize the nature of the radioactive compound released by the ductal cells, the supernatant was extracted with chloroform:methanol:HCl (200:100:1). This extract was concentrated under vacuum, and the lipids were analyzed on TLC plates using two different elution systems: chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (90:8:1:0.8) for the separation of AA and its oxidation metabolites and petroleum ether:diethylether:acetic acid (60:45:1) for the separation of AA and diacylglycerol. Unlabeled AA was used as standard (R F = 0.72 and 0.43 for the above described elution systems, respectively) and was visualized using iodine vapor. The bands were scraped from the plates, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. The [3H]AA released represented about 80% of the total counts found in the supernatant. Total cellular lipids were extracted as described previously (30Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C406-C415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, pellets from ductal cells were resuspended in 0.9% NaCl and transferred to ice-cold glass tubes containing 500 μl of chloroform:methanol:HCl (200:100:1). After 30 min in an ice bath, a final concentration of 0.1 m HCl was added and the tubes were vortexed and let at room temperature. The tubes were then centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min; 200 μl of the organic phase were vacuum-dried in an automatic SpeedVac concentrator (Savant AS290), and resuspended in 40 μl chloroform. Aliquots (30 μl) were spotted on 20 × 20-cm Silica Gel 60 F254 plates. An ascending chromatography was performed using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (75:45:12:3) as the eluant for the analysis of phospholipids. Spots were identified by comigration with authentic standards, which were visualized by exposure to iodine. The silica gel containing radioactivity was scraped into scintillation vials and quantified by liquid scintillation. Total RNA was extracted from gland tissue and purified cell fractions using a genomic-free RNA extraction kit (GStract™ RNA isolation kit II, Maxim Biotech, Inc.) based on the Chomczynski and Sacchi method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1.5 μg of RNA using random primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in accordance with the supplier's instructions. Specific primers for the detection of P2X7 transcripts were designed using the Genetics Computer Group program GCG Primer. Upstream and downstream primers were based on unique sequences within exon 8 and exon 12, respectively, stretching bases 958–980 (P2X7.up) and 1323–1341 (P2X7.down) of the P2X7 sequence (GenBank accession no. X95882). The amplified product was thus predicted to be 384 base pairs in length. These regions correspond to the intracellular and carboxyl-terminal extracellular loops, respectively, of the corresponding amino acid sequence. PCR was performed as described previously (32Matute C. Sánchez-Gómez M.V. Martı́nez-Millán L. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8830-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A hot-start touchdown PCR protocol with thin-walled tubes was employed involving denaturation at 95 °C and extension at 72 °C. The annealing stages began at 65 °C, dropped by 1 °C every two cycles until 56 °C, at which all subsequent annealings were performed. Each step lasted for 50 s, and a total of 45 cycles were performed. The reaction mixture contained 1.5 mm magnesium. Amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.8% agarose gels and viewed with ethidium bromide staining. A φX174 HaeIII digest was used as a size standard. In order to confirm that the amplicons observed corresponded to RNA and not contaminating genomic DNA, we performed PCR under identical conditions with rat genomic DNA. The amplicon in this case was ≫1400 base pairs, indicating the presence of the four predicted introns in the gDNA between exons 8 and 12 (data not shown). Thus, the PCR products obtained from the submandibular gland and from the acinar and ductal cells were derived from expressed mRNA and not genomic DNA. [Ca2+]i was determined as described previously (18Amsallem H. Métioui M. VandenAbeele A. Elyamani A. Moran A. Dehaye J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1546-C1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ducts from one rat were resuspended in 3 ml of HBS. Aliquots (1 ml) were incubated at 25 °C with 1 ml of HBS buffer in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.25 mm CaCl2 and 2 μm Fura-2/AM. After 45 min, 1 ml of the suspension was removed, washed with isotonic NaCl, and resuspended in 2 ml of magnesium-free HBS without BSA or amino acids. The cells were constantly stirred in the cuvette, and the excitation wavelength was switched every second from 340 nm to 380 nm (slit width 4 nm). The light emitted at 505 nm was recorded (slit width 8 nm). The voltage of the photomultiplier was 700–750 V. At the start of each assay, the signal observed after excitation at 345 nm was arbitrarily set at 50% maximal scale by adjusting this voltage. At the end of the assay, the traces were calibrated with the successive addition of 0.5 mm digitonin and 40 mm EGTA (pH 8.5 with Tris). Autofluorescence was measured at both wavelengths in cells that were not loaded with the Ca2+ indicator and was subtracted from all the data before calculation of the ratios. The calcium concentration was estimated by the ratio method (33Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using aK d value of 263 nm. The ductal cells obtained from 3 rats were labeled withmyo-[2-3H]inositol free of magnesium as described previously (21Métioui M. Amsallem H. Alzola E. Chaı̈b N. Elyamani A. Moran A. Marino A. Dehaye J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice with 10 ml of HBS in the absence of labeled inositol and finally resuspended in 4.5 ml of HBS in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. They were preincubated in this medium for 10 min at 37 °C. Aliquots (100 μl) were incubated in a final 500 μl of HBS medium in the presence of the tested agents for 5 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was discarded, and 500 μl of 10% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid were added to the pellet. The samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was transferred to glass tubes. The pellets were washed again with 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged and the supernatants were pooled. The trichloroacetic acid was extracted with diethylether saturated with water. The extract was neutralized with 1 m KOH and diluted with 8 ml of 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). The inositol phosphates were isolated using a Dowex AG1-X8 column (34Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hansley M.R. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The glycerophosphoinositol was eluted with 12 ml of 30 mmammonium formate. The inositol derivatives (inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates) were eluted simultaneously from the Dowex column using 12 ml of 0.7 m ammonium formate and 0.1 mformic acid. The radioactivity eluted off the column was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Each determination was performed in triplicate. The ductal cells isolated from 1 rat were resuspended in 4 ml of magnesium-free HBS. The stimulation of the cells with the agonist was performed for 10 min as described for the [3H]AA release assay. At the end of the incubation, the cells were centrifuged for 30 s at 10,000 × g. Four hundred μl of the supernatant were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and kept on ice. The kallikrein assay was performed as described previously (18Amsallem H. Métioui M. VandenAbeele A. Elyamani A. Moran A. Dehaye J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1546-C1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was run in a 1-ml plastic cuvette using 300 μl of Tris buffer (0.5 m, pH 8.2), 300 μl of substrate solution (2 mg/mlNα-benzoyl-dl-argininep-nitroanilide), and 300 μl of the sample. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm during 3 min in a Uvikon 943 spectrophotometer. The results were plotted as absorbance versus time, and the activity of the enzyme was calculated using the slope of the linear part of the curve. An aliquot of the ductal suspension was homogenized by sonication (2 pulses of 5 s at 8 μm with a Soniprep 150) and assayed for kallikrein content. This result gave an estimate of the total content of kallikrein in the cell suspension. Results were expressed as a percentage of the total kallikrein content released during the incubation at 37 °C. These results were corrected with regard to the kallikrein present in the medium prior to the incubation of the cells with the agonists. Unless otherwise indicated, values in figures are given as means ± standard error (S.E.) of n experiments performed in triplicate with n different cell preparations. Statistical significance of the results was determined using a Student's test and represented by *** (p ≤ 0.001), ** (0.001 ≤ p ≤ 0.01), * (0.01 ≤p ≤ 0.05), and NS (not significant) (0.05 ≤p). RSMG ductal cells were prelabeled with [3H]AA and incubated for various times in the presence of either 1 mm ATP or 100 μm Bz-ATP. As shown in Fig. 1, the two purinergic agonists increased the release of [3H]AA from prelabeled cells. The maximum stimulation was observed after 15 min. After 20 min of exposure to ATP or Bz-ATP, the release of [3H]AA was increased by 216 ± 13% and 310 ± 12%, respectively. The other purinergic agonists tested (2-MeSATP, AMP-PNP, α,β-methylene ATP, β,γ-methylene ATP, 5′-adenosine tetraphosphate, ATPγS, ADP, and UTP) were unable to elicit a significant response in terms of [3H]AA release (Table I). Among the nonpurinergic secretagogues tested, only 100 μmcarbachol was able to induce a small effect (118 ± 8%). The stimulation of the cells for 20 min with calcium ionophores (100 nm ionomycin or 1 μm A23187) or the depletion of the intracellular calcium stores in cells incubated for 20 min with 1 μm thapsigargin had no significant effect on the release of [3H]AA from the cells (Table I). In separate experiments, it was shown that all these agents (epinephrine, carbachol, ionomycin, and thapsigargin) increased the [Ca2+]i in the ductal suspension (data not shown).Table IEffect of purinergic agonists and other Ca2+-mobilizing agents on the release of [3H]arachidonic acid[3H]AA release (% of control)Statistical significanceUnstimulated cells1001 mm ATP238 ± 91-ap ≤ 0.001.100 μmBz-ATP310 ± 121-ap ≤ 0.001.100 μmMeSATP110 ± 11 NS1-bNS, not significant, p ≥ 0.05.100 μmα,β-MeATP109 ± 4NS100 μmβ,γ-MeATP102 ± 2NS100 μmAMP-PNP100 ± 3NS100 μm ATPP102 ± 8NS100 μm ATPγS108 ± 6NS1 mm ADP96 ± 4NS1 mm UTP98 ± 5NS100 μm carbachol118 ± 8NS100 μm epinephrine105 ± 0NS10 μm isoproterenol98 ± 3NS100 nm ionomycin105 ± 3NS1 μmA23187138 ± 16NS1 μmthapsigargin106 ± 2NS[3H]AA-labeled ductal cells were washed and resuspended in a magnesium-free HBS medium containing 0.125% BSA.

For example, it has been shown to activate transcription synergistically with itself or with other regulatory factors, such as AP1, when bound to a consensus palindromic element or “simple GRE” that is multimerized or linked tightly with an AP1 site. In contrast, at certain “composite GREs” GR and AP1 bind to nonconsensus sequences, and GR either activates or represses depending on the subunit composition of AP1. To uncouple the contributions to regulatory behavior of binding sequences and binding element arrangements, we examined GR action at “paired elements,” combinations of a simple GRE and a consensus AP1 site, separated by different distances. We found that GR synergized with either c-Jun or c-Jun-c-Fos at paired elements with GRE-AP1 site separations of ≥26 base pairs. In contrast, paired elements with separations of 14–18 base pairs mimicked the composite GRE, i.e. GR synergized with c-Jun and repressed c-Jun-c-Fos. In DNA binding studies, GR and AP1 cooccupied the paired elements. We conclude that the arrangement of binding sites within a compound response element can be a major determinant of regulatory factor action.

Gene regulatory regions frequently encompass several kilobase pairs of DNA and contain numerous binding sites for transcriptional regulatory factors (1Herbomel P. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of transcription initiation for any particular gene is determined by a combination of synergistic and inhibitory interactions among the regulatory proteins that are brought, directly or indirectly, to the DNA (2Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6347-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 3Strahle U. Schmid W. Schutz G.

In some cases, binding sites for interacting factors may be separated by hundreds if not thousands of base pairs (bp),1 whereas in others two or more regulatory factors may bind in close proximity to each other. In yet other cases, only one of the factors may bind, whereas interacting factors are tethered to the DNA through protein-protein interactions. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a hormone-dependent transcription regulator that uses all of these types of DNA sites to achieve a complex array of context-dependent regulatory effects (6Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 7Yamamoto K.R. Pearce D. Thomas J. Miner J.N. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 22. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 1169-1192Google Scholar): 1) Synergistic activity results when binding sites for a variety of factors are paired with a consensus GR-binding site (also called a simple hormone response element (HRE)) (3Strahle U. Schmid W. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3389-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); 2) GR represses the activity of certain activators such as AP1 and NF-κB at their respective consensus sites (8Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.G. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 9Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). This repression does not require binding of GR to the sites that bind only the target factor and are thus termed “tethering” elements. GR activity at this type of element appears to require direct protein-protein interaction between GR and the repressed factor; 3) GR can either repress or stimulate transcription at composite GREs (cGREs). For example, the proliferin cGRE has juxtaposed binding sites for GR and AP1 family members, and the composition of the AP1 dimer bound determines whether the receptor represses or activates transcription (4Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 10Zhang X.K. Dong J.M. Chiu J.F. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2491-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When AP1 is comprised of c-Jun-c-Jun homodimers, the receptor activates transcription from a linked gene, and when AP1 is comprised of c-Jun-c-Fos heterodimers, the receptor represses transcriptional activity. Thus, the regulatory response of each of these sequences differs qualitatively from the others. The first two types are typically induced (simple and paired elements) or repressed (tethering elements) by the receptor, whereas the third, the cGRE, can activate or repress in a context-dependent fashion. Consistent with its distinct regulatory behavior, the sequence of the prototypic cGRE, plfG, is also quite different from that of the simple HRE. Only short stretches (up to 3 bp) of the consensus HRE can be discerned, whereas a near-consensus AP1 site (5 of 7 match) can be recognized (4Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Both AP1 and GR bind to the element in vitro. More recently, other cGREs have been identified, also characterized by juxtaposed or overlapping GR- and AP1-binding sites and the same biphasic response to GR, depending on the composition of AP1 (10Zhang X.K. Dong J.M. Chiu J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8248-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mittal R. Kumar K.U. Pater A. Pater M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1701-1708PubMed Google Scholar). In principle, there are several possible mechanisms that could underlie the distinct behavior of the cGRE. We consider here four classes: 1) The DNA could have an allosteric effect on the receptor, AP1, or both that influences their activities. This type of effect could be either sequence-driven or DNA topology-driven (see below); 2) The relative position of the factors on the DNA could introduce constraints that permit only certain interactions; 3) The DNA site could bind a third factor that specifies activation or repression; 4) The composition of AP1 could specify activation versus repression whenever DNA-binding sites for both GR and AP1 are present, regardless of spacing or sequence. According to this mechanism, GR would synergize with c-Jun and repress c-Jun-c-Fos at any element that has binding sites for both. The above considerations led us to ask whether the sequence of the binding sites, the composition of the AP1, or the relative positions of the factor-binding sites was the critical determinant of composite element behavior. We therefore constructed a series of paired response elements consisting of a simple HRE at varying distances from a consensus AP1 site (see Fig. 1) and tested their transcriptional activity in the presence of GR, c-Jun, and c-Fos, as well as their ability to bind these factors simultaneously in vitro. We found that paired elements, appropriately spaced, can demonstrate cGRE behavior and thus that the relationship of DNA sites is an important determinant of transcription factor interactions. Moreover, paired elements that demonstrate composite behavior are able to bind both GR and AP1, simultaneously suggesting that the switch from activation to repression does not involve disruption of DNA binding but rather that the factors mutually influence each others' activities. Paired element oligonucleotides, G(n)A, where n is the center-to-center distance, in nucleotides, between the two sites, were constructed by annealing single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the sequences shown in Fig. 1 (and below) with their reverse complements. The top strand sequences contained SalI restriction sites at the 5′ ends, and the bottom strands containedXhoI sites at their 5′ ends. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were then ligated into the vector ΔODCO, which had been digested with SalI restriction enzyme and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (0.5 units for 15 min) followed by heat treatment to kill the phosphatase (70 °C for 10 min). ΔODCO contains the Drosophila Adh minimal promoter driving expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (4Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Inserts were diagnosed by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, and then positives were confirmed by sequencing (Biomolecular Resource Center, UCSF). The same oligonucleotides were end labeled using T4 DNA kinase for gel shift experiments. Two forms of G(16)A were synthesized, both of which were tested in transfection assays. One was also used to make probe for gel shift experiments (see below), whereas the other was made with a unique BglII restriction site between the HRE and AP1 sites. It has the sequence: TCGAGTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGATCTGAGTCAG (HRE and AP1 sites are underlined). Larger insertions (n = 39 nucleotides or more) were made by digesting this plasmid withBglII and ligating in size fractionated fragments. The fragments for insertion were generated by digesting pBluescript DNA with Sau3AI (four-base recognition sequence) followed by low melt gel isolation. Minipreps were performed, and plasmids that appeared to have desired size were sequenced. 60–80% confluent culture plates of murine F9 cells (Cell Culture Facility, UCSF) were grown at 5% CO2, Rh-90%, 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium H-16 (Cell Culture Facility, UCSF) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected in 6-cm plates using calcium phosphate precipitation, as described previously (13Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) with the following plasmids (prepared by the CsCl2 method): 2 μg of ΔODCO-based reporter plasmid, 2 μg of GR expression plasmid, 6RGR (14Godowski P.J. Rusconi S. Miesfeld R. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1987; 325: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and 0.1 μg of Δ6RL (β-galactosidase plasmid) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Expression plasmids pRSV-c-Jun and pRSV-c-Fos (a gift of Robert Tjian) were included as indicated in figure legends. When pRSV-c-Jun alone was transfected, 0.25 μg of c-Jun expression plasmid were used, and when pRSV-c-Jun and pRSV-c-Fos were transfected together, 0.125 μg of each were used. After 16 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed free of precipitate, glycerol shocked for 90 s, and transferred to fresh medium containing 10−7m corticosterone (Sigma). 24 h later cells were harvested, and extracts were prepared and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (13Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Representative experiments are shown in bar graphs; values shown in the tables below graphs represent the mean fold activation (± S.E.) of four independent transfections performed on different days. GR DBD was expressed in E. coli (strain BL21(DE3)plysS) as a gene fragment encoding amino acids 407–556 (termed X556; molecular mass, 19.0 kDa) in the plasmid pET-14b (Novagen, Madison, WI). After a single colony culture reached A 600 = 0.6, isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was added to 0.5 mm. 3 h later the induced cells were collected and precipitated with 30% ammonium sulfate. Pellets were resuspended and subjected to minivacuum dialysis for 2 h at 4 °C against HGEDZ50 buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm ZnSO4) as described previously (11Mittal R. Kumar K.U. Pater A. Pater M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1701-1708PubMed Google Scholar). After microcentrifugation (15,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), supernatants were used in gel shift assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift (“gel shift”) assays were performed using GR truncated derivative, X556, expressed in E. coli. The paired element oligonucleotides G(16)A and G(26)A (see Fig. 1) were end-labeled by using T4 DNA kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to gel purification. Binding reactions were performed as described previously (15Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and complexes were resolved on a 7.8% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. Reactions had 80 ng of GR, 60 ng of c-Jun, and 60 ng of c-Fos as shown in Fig. 4. Approximately 3 ng of probe with specific activity of 5 × 107 cpm/μg was present. Probe sequences were as follows: G(16)A, CGACCTCGACTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGCTATGAGTC AG; G(26)A, CGACCTCGACTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGCTACGAACCCTCGTGAGTCAGTCGA. Cold competitor DNAs were used at 300-fold molar excess and had the following sequences: TAT HRE, CGACCTCGACTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGCTACTCGA; AP1 site, CGTAGCATTAGCTATGAGTCAGTCGA. For G(16)A, unlabeled probe oligonucleotide was used as cold competitor. Response elements within oligonucleotide sequences are underlined. GR acts synergistically with various unrelated transcription factors such as Sp1, NF1, and estrogen receptor when their binding sites are near each other (3Strahle U. Schmid W. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3389-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, synergy does not always result when binding sites for GR and another factor are near each other. Indeed, GR represses c-Jun-c-Fos activity at both consensus AP1 sites, to which GR does not bind, and at cGREs, to which both GR and AP1 bind. The GR- and AP1-binding sites in the proliferin (4Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), α-fetoprotein (10Zhang X.K. Dong J.M. Chiu J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8248-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and papilloma virus (11Mittal R. Kumar K.U. Pater A. Pater M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1701-1708PubMed Google Scholar) cGREs are closely juxtaposed with center-to-center distances of less than 20 nucleotides. These observations raise the question of whether GR represses c-Jun-c-Fos in all contexts, regardless of the arrangement of their respective binding sites or if either the sequence or binding site spacing in the composite element is important for repression. To address this question, we first asked if repression or synergy would occur when a simple HRE and an AP1 site were paired at a greater distance than in the composite elements. We chose, as a “typical” simple HRE, the sequence found 2.5 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription start site of the TAT gene. This element has been found to mediate transcriptional activation, never repression, by GR in all contexts examined, whether in the setting of the endogenous gene or fused to various heterologous promoters (16Strahle U. Klock G. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7871-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We juxtaposed this HRE with a consensus AP1 site (similarly mediating activation by AP1) at varying separations and placed the resulting “paired elements” upstream of a minimal promoter driving chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression (Fig. 1). These reporters were cotransfected with GR and c-Jun or c-Jun and c-Fos together into AP1-deficient F9 cells (4Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, we found that the TAT HRE separated by 39 bp from a consensus AP1 site served as a weak GRE in the absence of cotransfected c-Jun or c-Jun-c-Fos. Both c-Jun and c-Jun-c-Fos stimulated reporter activity, as described previously for consensus AP1 sites (17Abate C. Curran T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar) and, importantly, GR stimulated both c-Jun-c-Jun homodimers and c-Jun-c-Fos heterodimers in a hormone-dependent manner. The augmentation of c-Jun-c-Jun activity exceeded that of c-Jun-c-Fos largely because the c-Jun-c-Fos basal was higher, consistent with the greater activity of the heterodimer (4Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 8Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.G. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P.

Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). GR action in conjunction with c-Jun-c-Fos was more than the sum of the activity of either alone and was therefore synergistic. However, it was substantially less than multiplicative, whereas GR action in conjunction with c-Jun-c-Jun was substantially more than multiplicative. Various other spacings were also tried with similar results (Fig. 2 B). Notably, both G(26)A and G(31)A, which place the two sites in opposite phases, mediated hormone-dependent augmentation of both c-Jun-c-Jun and c-Jun-c-Fos. It is notable, however, that the hormone-induced activity in the presence of c-Jun-c-Fos was greater for G(26)A than for G(31)A. This type of synergistic behavior is similar to that identified previously for GR and other activators (3Strahle U. Schmid W. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3389-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) but is quite distinct from the behavior that GR had demonstrated previously at consensus AP1 sites (repression of either c-Jun-c-Jun or c-Jun-c-Fos) or cGREs (activation with c-Jun and repression of c-Jun-c-Fos) (4Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 8Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.G. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P.

These results indicate that GR does not repress c-Jun-c-Fos activity in all contexts but rather that either the spacing or sequence of the factor-binding sites (or surrounding sequence) must confer the repression phenotype. The prototypic cGRE, plfG, was identified by the DNaseI footprint produced by either purified bacterially expressed GR DNA-binding domain (DBD) or full-length GR expressed in HeLa cells (4Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Within plfG is a near-consensus AP1 site, which is protected by purified c-Jun or c-Jun-c-Fos in DNase I footprinting experiments. However, the plfG sequence bears little resemblance to the consensus sequence for a simple HRE (Fig. 1), and thus the relative spacing of the GRE and the AP1 site cannot be precisely determined. It is clear, however, that they are closely juxtaposed. With these observations in mind, we wanted to determine whether at smaller separations the paired elements would function as a cGRE. We first tested paired elements with a TAT HRE separated from a consensus AP1 site by 16 nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 3 A, a TAT HRE separated by 16 nucleotides from a consensus AP1 site produces a response element, G(16)A, whose response to AP1 and GR is qualitatively identical to that of a cGRE: It is activated by GR in the presence of c-Jun, repressed by GR in the presence of c-Jun and c-Fos, and minimally affected in the absence of AP1 factors. Spacings of 14, 17, and 18 nucleotides also demonstrated this type of regulatory switch (Fig. 3 B). Smaller separations down to 11 nucleotides also supported repression of c-Jun-c-Fos but only weak activation in the presence of c-Jun alone (data not shown). Identical results were obtained using a paired element with a different sequence between the TAT HRE and the AP1 site (see “Experimental Procedures”), indicating that the effect is due to juxtaposition of the two sites and not to the sequence of the intervening DNA. A(16)G (with reverse orientation from G(16)A) also gave a similar response, indicating that the respective proximities of AP1 and GR to the general transcription machinery are not important for this effect. As a first step toward understanding the mechanism of the response of G(16)A, we examined the influence of GR and AP1 factors on each other's DNA binding. We examined first the ability of GR to co-occupy this element with c-Jun-c-Fos heterodimers and c-Jun homodimers in gel shift assays. We performed gel shift experiments using purified bacterially expressed GR DBD and full-length c-Jun and c-Fos proteins. GR DBD, rather than full-length, was used because the different retarded species could not be discerned using full-length receptor, consistent with previous reports (20Schmid W. Strahle U. Schutz G. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Liu W. Wang J., Yu, G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 1 and 6), c-Jun-c-Fos and GR DBD, when incubated separately, each shifted G(16)A to distinct positions. When the three proteins were added together, a third species appeared (lane 2). The uppermost band and the receptor band were competed by cold TAT HRE (lane 3), whereas the uppermost band and the AP1 band were competed by cold AP1 competitor DNA (lane 4). Finally, all three bands were competed by cold G(16)A (lane 5). We conclude that the upper band represents DNA co-occupied by GR and c-Jun-c-Fos heterodimers. This conclusion was further supported by antibody supershift experiments using anti-c-Jun, anti-c-Fos, and anti-GR antibodies (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when c-Jun homodimers were incubated with GR-DBD (lane 7), indicating that GR-DBD and the AP1 factors are capable of co-occupying the paired element under activating as well as repressing conditions. Not surprisingly, GR-DBD and AP1 (c-Jun or c-Jun-c-Fos) were able to co-occupy G(26)A as well (data not shown). Our results show that the relative positions of a paired HRE and AP1 site profoundly influences hormone-induced activity. When a site for only one of the factors is present, then the other has an inhibitory effect (mutual inhibition) regardless of whether AP1 is composed of c-Jun-c-Jun or c-Jun-c-Fos (8Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.G. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 18Yang-Yen H.-F. Chambard J.C. Sun Y.L. Smeal T.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). 2D. Pearce, unpublished data. In contrast, when the two sites are both present but not closely juxtaposed (from 26 to at least 210 bp), they act synergistically regardless of the composition of AP1. However, when binding sites for both GR and AP1 are closely juxtaposed (separated by 14–18 bp), they behave as cGREs. With respect to cGRE function, several points are of interest: First, the paired elements are composed of a simple HRE and a consensus AP1 site that mediate transcriptional activation when present alone or separated from each other by 26 bp or more. Second, the surrounding sequences can be altered without affecting the response. Third, multiple different paired element spacings support a composite response. Thus, our data suggest that the relative position of the factor-binding sites is a critical determinant of composite behavior. When AP1 and GR DNA sites are paired but not closely juxtaposed, synergy may result from several possible mechanisms. These include cooperative recruitment of a coactivator, action at distinct rate-limiting steps in transcription initiation, or cooperative DNA binding (23Herschlag D. Johnson F.B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although the mechanistic basis of synergy between GR and AP1 has not been determined, it is interesting to note that both interact physically with CREB-binding protein, and this interaction has been suggested to explain mutual inhibition at their respective sites by titration of this important coactivator (24Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). When sites for both are present they can, in principle, cooperate in the recruitment of CREB-binding protein, providing a plausible unifying mechanism for synergy at paired sites and mutual inhibition at single sites. However, this type of mechanism does not account for composite behavior because it does not account for the opposite responses to GR of c-Jun-c-Jun and c-Jun-c-Fos. The simplest explanation for the composite response is that due to the proximity of the sites GR disrupts c-Jun-c-Fos (but not c-Jun-c-Jun binding), as has been suggested previously to explain GR repression of cAMP-response element-binding protein-driven transcription at an overlapping HRE and cAMP response element (25Akerblom I.E. Slater E.P. Beato M. Baxter J.D. Mellon P.L. Science. 1988; 241: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Our gel shift experiments suggest, however, that GR and c-Jun-c-Fos heterodimers can bind simultaneously to the paired element. Because these experiments were done with partial length GR protein, we cannot rule out a role of the N or C terminus in disrupting DNA binding by c-Jun-c-Fos. However, two observations suggest that this is not the case: 1) Full-length GR and AP1 co-occupy plfG (4Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar); 2) mineralocorticoid receptor has a similar ligand-binding domain and a substantially larger N terminus and binds with equal affinity to the same site yet does not repress AP1 activity at either plfG or G(16)A (13Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).2 These arguments suggest that GR and c-Jun-c-Fos are bound simultaneously to G(16)A but that their activities are altered by virtue of their proximity to each other. With this idea in mind, we consider four possible mechanisms that could account for such a proximity-dependent effect: 1) c-Jun-c-Jun and c-Jun-c-Fos could cause distinct local changes in DNA topology that are transmitted to GR bound nearby. Interestingly, there is evidence to support the idea that c-Jun-c-Jun homodimers and c-Jun-c-Fos heterodimers bend DNA in opposite directions, in vitro (26Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Cell. 1991; 66: 317-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 27Kerppola T.K. Curran T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2907-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the question of DNA bending by AP1 remains unresolved (28Sitlani A. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3248-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is appealing to speculate that the distinct local topologies have differential allosteric effects on GR conformation and activity; 2) GR, which has also been found to bend DNA (29Petz L.N. Nardulli A.M. Kim J. Horwitz K.B. Freedman L.P. Shapiro D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), could exert local effects on DNA topology that influence c-Jun-c-Fos activity differently from that of c-Jun-c-Jun; 3) GR bound to the paired element might make specific base contacts with the AP1 site, resulting in a sequence-driven (as opposed to a local topology-driven) conformational change in GR as proposed for Oct1-VP16 activity at TAATGARAT sequences; 4) Constraints imposed by their proximity when bound to adjacent sites might force the GR-c-Jun-c-Fos complex (but not the GR-c-Jun-c-Jun complex) into an inactive conformation that, for example, interacts poorly with coactivators or the general transcription machinery. In view of the multiple paired element spacings that are tolerated, it seems unlikely that GR is contacting the AP1 site. Rather, mechanisms based on either a factor-driven change in local DNA topology or constrained protein-protein interaction seem more likely. These latter two possibilities cannot be distinguished by our data. In principle, experiments using reporters driven by paired elements separated by intrinsically bent DNA (26Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Cell. 1991; 66: 317-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) should be able to distinguish these mechanisms. Such studies have been initiated, but preliminary results have been equivocal. However, a local topology-driven DNA allosteric effect is still quite plausible and presents an intriguing extension of the concept of DNA-induced allosteric effects on transcription factor activity (6Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Perhaps, by exerting distinct effects on local DNA topology, c-Jun-c-Fos heterodimers and c-Jun-c-Jun homodimers differentially influence the allosteric effect of DNA on GR activity. In any case, whether we attribute these findings to changes in protein-protein interaction or to alterations in local DNA topology, we conclude in either case that local DNA architecture plays an essential role in controlling transcription factor activities.

It has been proposed that GSH and superoxide dismutase (SOD) act in a concerted effort to eliminate biologically generated radicals.

The “radical sink hypothesis” proposed by Winterbourn (1Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 2Winterbourn C.C. Parker L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. 2. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 117-134Google Scholar) suggests a concerted antioxidant interaction between GSH and superoxide dismutase (SOD).1 In this proposal, biologically generated radicals (R⋅) oxidize GSH to form thiyl radicals (GS⋅) (Equation 1). As pointed out by Winterbourn (1Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar,2Winterbourn C.C. Parker L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. 2. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 117-134Google Scholar), this oxidizing thiyl radical is not biologically benign and can undergo other potentially harmful reactions. The reaction of GS⋅with the glutathione anion (GS−) produces the glutathione disulfide radical anion (GSSG⨪) (Equation 2), which, in turn, reduces molecular oxygen, forming superoxide (O⨪2) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) (Equation 3). In a concerted effort, SOD will catalyze the dismutation of superoxide, terminating the biologically generated free radical (Equation 4). This proposal has been shown to be thermodynamically feasible (3Koppenol W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).

Based on known rate constants, Wardman (4Wardman P. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 1-19Google Scholar) has estimated the fraction of thiyl radicals that are not conjugated as GSSG⨪ or GSOO⋅ (from the reaction of GS⋅ with O2). He found that in well oxygenated tissue (40 μm O2) at pH 7.4 and with 2 mmGSH, ∼80% of the thiyl radicals are not conjugated, indicating that GS⋅, not GSSG⨪, is the significant radical species under these conditions. In conjunction with this work, Wardman estimated the fraction of thiyl radicals which leads to superoxide formation in the presence of ascorbate. Based on the published rate constants (7Forni, L. G., Monig, J., Mora-Arellano, V. O., and Willson, R. L. (1983) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2,961–965Google Scholar, 8Tamba, M., and O'Neill, P. (1991) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2, 1681–1685Google Scholar) for the reaction of ascorbate with GS⋅, he found that in well oxygenated tissues (40 μm O2) at pH 7.4 with 1 mm GSH and 0.05 mm ascorbate, only 3% of the thiyl radicals follow the superoxide pathway. In addition, ascorbate abolishes O2 consumption that occurs from the reaction of GSH with enzymatically generated radical metabolites of acetaminophen (9Rao D.N.R. Fischer V. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 844-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), clozapine (10Fischer V. Haar J.A. Greiner L. Lloyd R.V. Mason R.P. Mol.

Dispos. 1997; 25: 468-480PubMed Google Scholar). When these radical metabolites are generated in the presence of ascorbate, the ascorbate radical is generated via oxidation by the metabolite radical, and the concentration of the ascorbate radical is minimally affected by the presence of GSH (9Rao D.N.R. Fischer V. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 844-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fischer V. Haar J.A. Greiner L. Lloyd R.V. Mason R.P. Mol.

Dispos. 1997; 25: 468-480PubMed Google Scholar). Work done with the VP-16 phenoxyl radical showed that, in a system that contained ascorbate and GSH, the ascorbate is oxidized prior to the oxidation of GSH (5Kagan V.E. Yalowich J.C. Day B.W. Goldman R. Gantchev T.G. Stoyanovsky D.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9651-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Goldman et al. (6Goldman R. Bors W. Michel C. Day B.W. Kagan V.E. Environ. Nutr. Interact. 1997; 1: 97-118Google Scholar) discussed the interaction of two phenoxyl radicals (from p-cresol and VP-16) and intercellular reductants (ascorbate, GSH, and NAD(P)H). Rate constants for relevant reactions led them to conclude that GSH should be well protected from oxidation by p-cresol phenoxyl radical unless the concentration of ascorbate drops below 1/600th that of GSH.In view of the absence of experimental data exploring the role of physiological concentrations of ascorbate and GSH in the fate of biologically generated free radicals, we have initiated an investigation using horseradish peroxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to generate tyrosyl radicals. The fate of the tyrosyl radical was determined in the presence of varying ratios of ascorbate and GSH using oxygen consumption measurements and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.DISCUSSIONThe results presented clearly demonstrate that the tyrosyl radical preferentially oxidizes ascorbate, as opposed to GSH. This conclusion is supported by: 1) nearly complete elimination of oxygen consumption upon the addition of 100 μm ascorbate to a complete oxygen-consuming horseradish peroxidase/H2O2/tyrosine system containing 8 mm GSH (Fig. 2, D); 2) only minor perturbation of the observed ascorbate radical ESR signal intensity when 8 mm GSH was added to a complete horseradish peroxidase/H2O2/tyrosine system with 100 μm ascorbate (Fig. 5, B); and 3) the near total elimination of the DMPO/⋅SG adduct formation upon addition of 100 μm ascorbate to a complete horseradish peroxidase/H2O2/tyrosine system containing 8 mm GSH and 100 mm DMPO (Fig. 6,D).The formation of the tyrosyl radical and the subsequent oxidation of ascorbate or GSH are outlined in Scheme FS1. In all of the experiments, tyrosine stimulated ascorbate and GSH oxidation, demonstrating that the tyrosyl radical was the major radical product of the horseradish peroxidase compound I reaction, even in the presence of ascorbate or GSH. The radical sink hypothesis put forth by Winterbourn (1Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 2Winterbourn C.C. Parker L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. 2. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 117-134Google Scholar) follows a reaction pathway initiated by the reaction of an oxidizing free radical with GSH. When tyrosine is the radical, this reaction does not occur in the presence of physiological concentrations of ascorbate, GSH, and O2. Instead, the tyrosyl radical reacts directly with ascorbate to form the ascorbate radical and regenerate tyrosine.In order to evaluate relative biological significance of ascorbate and GSH, one needs to consider physiological concentrations and mechanisms of regeneration. Intracellular levels of GSH in mammalian cells range from 0.5–10 mm (30Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 31Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

The concentration of GSH used throughout these experiments represents the upper limit of the concentrations found in mammalian tissue.Ascorbate concentrations in human tissue are quite variable, ranging from roughly 40 μm in blood plasma (38Hornig D.

The concentration of ascorbate used in the present experiments represents the lower limit of the concentrations found in mammalian tissue. With respect to regeneration mechanisms of ascorbate, the ascorbate radical will undergo a pH-dependent second-order dismutation at the rate of approximately 2 × 105m−1 s−1 at pH 7 (40Bielski B.H.J. Seib P.A. Tolbert B.M. Ascorbic Acid: Chemisty, Metabolism, and Uses. American Chemical Society, Washington, D.

In addition, dehydroascorbate is reduced to ascorbate by an NAD(P)H-dependent enzymatic system (41Buettner G.R. Jurkiewicz B.A. Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 91-115Google Scholar).The ascorbate/GSH concentrations and ratios used in this study realistically represent physiological concentrations. The superoxide pathway proposed by Winterbourn could occur in a biological system which does not have sufficient ascorbate such as cultured cells, which can be devoid of ascorbate (6Goldman R. Bors W. Michel C. Day B.W. Kagan V.E. Environ. Nutr. Interact. 1997; 1: 97-118Google Scholar). Even in systems devoid of ascorbate, GSH may not be properly labeled an antioxidant since other reactive radicals (GS⋅, GSSG⨪, GSOO⋅, and O⨪2) are generated. Ascorbate is the superior reducing agent with a reduction potential of +0.3 V versus +0.9 V for GSH (3Koppenol W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42Buettner G.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). The ascorbate radical is a highly delocalized π radical and is quite unreactive, which makes it a highly desirable biological antioxidant. Unlike GS⋅, the ascorbate radical is not known to cause any biological damage (40Bielski B.H.J. Seib P.A. Tolbert B.M. Ascorbic Acid: Chemisty, Metabolism, and Uses. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1982: 81-100Google Scholar).These results clarify the roles of ascorbate and GSH in neutralizing the tyrosyl radical. The results are not specific for the tyrosyl radical and should hold true for many oxidizing free radicals formed by peroxidases (9Rao D.N.R. Fischer V. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 844-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fischer V. Haar J.A. Greiner L. Lloyd R.V. Mason R.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 846-853PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gadelha F.R.

The “radical sink hypothesis” proposed by Winterbourn (1Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 2Winterbourn C.C. Parker L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. 2. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 117-134Google Scholar) suggests a concerted antioxidant interaction between GSH and superoxide dismutase (SOD).1 In this proposal, biologically generated radicals (R⋅) oxidize GSH to form thiyl radicals (GS⋅) (Equation 1). As pointed out by Winterbourn (1Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar,2Winterbourn C.C. Parker L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. 2. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 117-134Google Scholar), this oxidizing thiyl radical is not biologically benign and can undergo other potentially harmful reactions. The reaction of GS⋅with the glutathione anion (GS−) produces the glutathione disulfide radical anion (GSSG⨪) (Equation 2), which, in turn, reduces molecular oxygen, forming superoxide (O⨪2) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) (Equation 3). In a concerted effort, SOD will catalyze the dismutation of superoxide, terminating the biologically generated free radical (Equation 4). This proposal has been shown to be thermodynamically feasible (3Koppenol W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). R⋅+GSH⇌RH+GS⋅(Eq. 1) GS⋅+GS−⇌GSSG⨪(Eq. 2) GSSG⨪+O2→GSSG+O⨪2(Eq. 3) 2 O⨪2+2H+ →SOD O2+H2O2(Eq. 4) However, the physiological relevance of GSH as an antioxidant has been questioned (4Wardman P. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 1-19Google Scholar, 5Kagan V.E. Yalowich J.C. Day B.W. Goldman R. Gantchev T.G. Stoyanovsky D.A.

Based on known rate constants, Wardman (4Wardman P. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 1-19Google Scholar) has estimated the fraction of thiyl radicals that are not conjugated as GSSG⨪ or GSOO⋅ (from the reaction of GS⋅ with O2). He found that in well oxygenated tissue (40 μm O2) at pH 7.4 and with 2 mmGSH, ∼80% of the thiyl radicals are not conjugated, indicating that GS⋅, not GSSG⨪, is the significant radical species under these conditions. In conjunction with this work, Wardman estimated the fraction of thiyl radicals which leads to superoxide formation in the presence of ascorbate. Based on the published rate constants (7Forni, L. G., Monig, J., Mora-Arellano, V. O., and Willson, R. L. (1983) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2,961–965Google Scholar, 8Tamba, M., and O'Neill, P. (1991) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2, 1681–1685Google Scholar) for the reaction of ascorbate with GS⋅, he found that in well oxygenated tissues (40 μm O2) at pH 7.4 with 1 mm GSH and 0.05 mm ascorbate, only 3% of the thiyl radicals follow the superoxide pathway. In addition, ascorbate abolishes O2 consumption that occurs from the reaction of GSH with enzymatically generated radical metabolites of acetaminophen (9Rao D.N.R. Fischer V. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 844-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), clozapine (10Fischer V. Haar J.A. Greiner L. Lloyd R.V. Mason R.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 846-853PubMed Google Scholar), crystal violet (11Gadelha F.R. Hanna P.M. Mason R.P. Docampo R. Chem. Biol.

Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2637-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and phenolphthalein (13Sipe Jr., H.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1997; 25: 468-480PubMed Google Scholar). When these radical metabolites are generated in the presence of ascorbate, the ascorbate radical is generated via oxidation by the metabolite radical, and the concentration of the ascorbate radical is minimally affected by the presence of GSH (9Rao D.N.R. Fischer V. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 844-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fischer V. Haar J.A. Greiner L. Lloyd R.V. Mason R.P. Mol.

Dispos. 1997; 25: 468-480PubMed Google Scholar). Work done with the VP-16 phenoxyl radical showed that, in a system that contained ascorbate and GSH, the ascorbate is oxidized prior to the oxidation of GSH (5Kagan V.E. Yalowich J.C. Day B.W. Goldman R. Gantchev T.G. Stoyanovsky D.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9651-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Goldman et al. (6Goldman R. Bors W. Michel C. Day B.W. Kagan V.E. Environ. Nutr. Interact. 1997; 1: 97-118Google Scholar) discussed the interaction of two phenoxyl radicals (from p-cresol and VP-16) and intercellular reductants (ascorbate, GSH, and NAD(P)H). Rate constants for relevant reactions led them to conclude that GSH should be well protected from oxidation by p-cresol phenoxyl radical unless the concentration of ascorbate drops below 1/600th that of GSH. In view of the absence of experimental data exploring the role of physiological concentrations of ascorbate and GSH in the fate of biologically generated free radicals, we have initiated an investigation using horseradish peroxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to generate tyrosyl radicals. The fate of the tyrosyl radical was determined in the presence of varying ratios of ascorbate and GSH using oxygen consumption measurements and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. DISCUSSIONThe results presented clearly demonstrate that the tyrosyl radical preferentially oxidizes ascorbate, as opposed to GSH. This conclusion is supported by: 1) nearly complete elimination of oxygen consumption upon the addition of 100 μm ascorbate to a complete oxygen-consuming horseradish peroxidase/H2O2/tyrosine system containing 8 mm GSH (Fig. 2, D); 2) only minor perturbation of the observed ascorbate radical ESR signal intensity when 8 mm GSH was added to a complete horseradish peroxidase/H2O2/tyrosine system with 100 μm ascorbate (Fig. 5, B); and 3) the near total elimination of the DMPO/⋅SG adduct formation upon addition of 100 μm ascorbate to a complete horseradish peroxidase/H2O2/tyrosine system containing 8 mm GSH and 100 mm DMPO (Fig. 6,D).The formation of the tyrosyl radical and the subsequent oxidation of ascorbate or GSH are outlined in Scheme FS1. In all of the experiments, tyrosine stimulated ascorbate and GSH oxidation, demonstrating that the tyrosyl radical was the major radical product of the horseradish peroxidase compound I reaction, even in the presence of ascorbate or GSH. The radical sink hypothesis put forth by Winterbourn (1Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 2Winterbourn C.C. Parker L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. 2. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 117-134Google Scholar) follows a reaction pathway initiated by the reaction of an oxidizing free radical with GSH. When tyrosine is the radical, this reaction does not occur in the presence of physiological concentrations of ascorbate, GSH, and O2. Instead, the tyrosyl radical reacts directly with ascorbate to form the ascorbate radical and regenerate tyrosine.In order to evaluate relative biological significance of ascorbate and GSH, one needs to consider physiological concentrations and mechanisms of regeneration. Intracellular levels of GSH in mammalian cells range from 0.5–10 mm (30Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 31Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

The concentration of ascorbate used in the present experiments represents the lower limit of the concentrations found in mammalian tissue. With respect to regeneration mechanisms of ascorbate, the ascorbate radical will undergo a pH-dependent second-order dismutation at the rate of approximately 2 × 105m−1 s−1 at pH 7 (40Bielski B.H.J. Seib P.A. Tolbert B.M. Ascorbic Acid: Chemisty, Metabolism, and Uses. American Chemical Society, Washington, D.

https://openalex.org/W2071843318,"BNC1 is a mammalian neuronal cation channel in the novel DEG/ENaC ion channel family. BNC1 channels are transiently activated by extracellular protons and are constitutively activated by insertion of large residues, such as valine, in place of Gly-430; residue 430 is a site where analogous mutations in someCaenorhabditis elegans family members cause a swelling neurodegeneration. Mutation of Gly-430 to a small amino acid, cysteine, neither generated constitutive currents nor allowed modification of this residue by sulfhydryl-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds. However, when protons activated the channel, Cys-430 became accessible to extracellular MTS reagents, which modified Cys-430 to generate constitutive currents. Fluorescent MTS reagents also labeled Cys-430 in activated channels. These data indicate that protons induce a reversible conformational change that activates BNC1 thereby exposing residue 430 to the extracellular solution. Once Cys-430 is modified with a large chemical group, the channel is prevented from relaxing back to the inactive state. These results link ligand-dependent activation and activation by mutations that cause neurodegeneration. BNC1 is a mammalian neuronal cation channel in the novel DEG/ENaC ion channel family. BNC1 channels are transiently activated by extracellular protons and are constitutively activated by insertion of large residues, such as valine, in place of Gly-430; residue 430 is a site where analogous mutations in someCaenorhabditis elegans family members cause a swelling neurodegeneration.

In addition, genetic studies suggest that three Caenorhabditis elegans family members (MEC-4, MEC-10, and UNC-105) require an interaction with extracellular collagen for normal activity (1Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 10Liu J. Schrank B. Waterston R.H.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Activation by an extracellular ligand is consistent with an important neurosensory function for some members of this channel family. For example, proton sensitivity, coupled with expression in peripheral nociceptive neurons, suggests that BNC1, BNaC-2, and DRASIC may be involved in sensation of painful stimuli. Expression of BNC1 and BNaC2 in the central nervous system also suggests a potential role in synaptic transmission. Several C. elegans DEG/ENaC proteins (DEG-1, MEC-4, MEC-10, UNC-105, and UNC-8) may serve as mechanosensory channels because mutations disrupt touch sensation and coordinated movement (10Liu J. Schrank B. Waterston R.H. Science. 1996; 273: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12Chalfie M. Wolinsky E.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Despite the obvious importance for their function, it is not known how ligands activate these neuronal cation channels. However, a clue comes from the observation that several DEG/ENaC channels can be activated by a specific mutation. Studies of DEG-1, MEC-4, and MEC-10 in C. elegans showed that rare dominant mutations at a specific conserved site caused neurons expressing the mutant protein to swell and degenerate (12Chalfie M. Wolinsky E. Nature. 1990; 345: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 14Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This swollen cellular phenotype suggested that the degeneration-causing, or “Deg” mutation caused persistent channel activation, thereby disrupting control of cell volume. Deg mutations affect a residue thought to lie just external to the second membrane-spanning sequence (M2) in or near the pore. The neurodegenerative phenotype required that Deg mutations substitute a Val or other large residue for the wild-type Ala residue, leading to the speculation that bulky side chains might interfere with the closing of a channel gate (1Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Subsequent electrophysiologic studies showed that analogous Deg mutations in BNC1 (6Waldmann R.

To understand how DEG/ENaC channels are gated and how Deg mutations cause persistent channel activation, we studied BNC1, a proton-activated Na+channel expressed in human neurons (5Price M.P.

Constructs were cloned into pMT3 (19Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following injection, oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's solution. 12–24 h after injection, whole cell currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp. During recording, oocytes were bathed in frog Ringer's solution (116 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). pH 7.4 and pH 6 solutions were buffered with 5 mm HEPES; more acidic solutions were buffered with 5 mmMES.1 Membrane voltage was held at −60 mV. MTS compounds were from Toronto Research Biochemicals (Toronto, Ontario). MTS compounds and amiloride were added to the extracellular solution that bathed the oocyte. 3–5 h after DNA injection, oocytes were pre-treated at 25 °C with 1 mm MTSEA at pH 5 for 5 min and at pH 7.4 for 20 min. The pre-treatment was designed to modify cysteines on endogenous cell-surface proteins with a nonfluorescent compound; at this early time point, oocytes were not yet expressing channels. Oocytes were then incubated in modified Barth's solution at 18 °C for 12–18 h to allow for channel expression. Oocytes were next exposed for 1 min at 25 °C to 5 μm MTSEA-fluorescein in frog Ringer's solution, pH 7.4 or pH 5; each oocyte was treated five times. Between MTSEA-fluorescein treatments, oocytes were kept in frog Ringer's solution, pH 7.4, for 1 min. After the fifth treatment, oocytes were washed extensively in modified Barth's solution. Oocytes were visualized and relative fluorescence calculated using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, MRC-600). Analysis was similar to that previously reported (20Mannuzzu L.M. Moronne M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Science. 1996; 271: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). When wild-type BNC1 is expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it generates only a very small basal Na+ current (5Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7879-7882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, acidification of the extracellular solution produces a transient activation (21Bassilana F. Champigny G. Waldmann R. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28819-28822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We first examined the effect of Deg mutations on basal channel activity at pH 7.4. In BNC1, the Deg residue is Gly-430. We found that channels containing Thr, Val, or Phe at position 430 generated large basal amiloride-sensitive currents (Fig. 1 A-D), consistent with a previous report (6Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In contrast, when a Cys was incorporated at position 430, the basal current was small and not different from wild type. However, treatment with extracellular protons stimulated a large transient current (Fig. 1, E and F). This is consistent with the finding that in MEC-4, mutation of the Deg residue to Cys did not cause neurodegeneration (13Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because Thr, Val, and Phe are larger than Gly or Cys, these results suggested that large amino acids at the Deg position activate BNC1 in the absence of a proton stimulus. Because a Cys at the Deg position may have been too small to activate BNC1, we tested the hypothesis that BNC1-Cys-430 might be activated if its side chain was chemically modified to attach a larger group. To test this, we used water-soluble sulfhydryl-reactive MTS compounds. When we applied MTSEA (100 μm) to the extracellular solution at pH 7.4, it did not activate BNC1-G430C, nor did it alter subsequent activation by protons (Fig. 2 A). We also tested three other MTS compounds, (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl) methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), sodium 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), and N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin), and found that they also failed to activate BNC1-G430C at pH 7.4 (Fig. 3 A-C). These results suggested that MTS compounds did not modify Cys-430, perhaps because the residue was not accessible to the extracellular solution under basal conditions at pH 7.4.Figure 3Modification of BNC1-G430C by MTS compounds. At times indicated by bars, 300 μm MTSET (ET), 5 mm MTSES (ES), 300 μm MTS-biotin (biotin), 1 mmamiloride, or pH 5 solution was applied to extracellular surface. Total number of experiments was, two (ET), four (ES), and four (biotin). Membrane voltage was −60 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the hypothesis that Cys-430 might become accessible once the channel is open, we simultaneously applied both protons (extracellular pH 5, to open the channel) and MTSEA (to modify Cys-430). This generated a large noninactivating current (Fig. 2 B) that persisted even after MTSEA and protons were removed. The current showed a cation selectivity and amiloride sensitivity similar to that of BNC1-G430V (Fig. 2, C and D). The effect of MTSEA at pH 5 was likely due to covalent modification of Cys-430 because the effect was irreversible, and because MTSEA did not stimulate BNC1-G430V or the wild-type channel under basal or activated conditions (not shown). Persistent activation of the channel after covalent modification of Cys-430 is consistent with the constitutive currents observed when Gly-430 is mutated to a larger residue (Fig. 1). The ability of MTSEA to modify Cys-430 at an acidic pH cannot be explained by a change in the protonation state of Cys-430, because MTS compounds react much more slowly with protonated cysteine side chains (22Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Rather, the acidic pH altered the channel conformation, activating the channel and exposing Cys-430 to extracellular MTSEA. MTSEA is a relatively small, cationic compound. To examine size and charge constraints for access to Cys-430, we tested slightly larger cationic (MTSET) and anionic (MTSES) compounds, as well as a much larger compound consisting of MTSEA linked to biotin. Like MTSEA, each of these compounds irreversibly activated BNC1-G430C, but only when the channel was activated by protons (Fig. 3, A-C). The MTS compounds did not appear to modify Cys-430 in the basal state because a drop in pH did not produce sustained activation after pretreatment with MTS. Moreover, application of MTS alone did not prevent subsequent activation by MTS when pH was reduced. We noticed that in some experiments a single application of an MTS compound with protons did not produce a maximal effect on current. For example, as shown in Fig. 3 C, repeated proton activation of BNC1-G430C in the presence of MTSES progressively increased current. This suggested that accessibility of Cys-430 might be limited to the time the channel was open, and once the channel had inactivated, Cys-430 was no longer accessible to MTS reagents. To test this further, we slowed the rate of inactivation by reducing the temperature from 23° to 10 °C (Fig. 4 B). Of note, the kinetics of inactivation were complex, perhaps consistent with the multimeric nature of the channel. Importantly, when inactivation was slowed and the duration of channel activity increased, a single application of protons with MTSET produced a greater sustained increase in current (Fig. 4, A and C). These results suggest that Cys-430 is accessible to MTS compounds only during the time that the channel is open. To confirm this and to directly label the channels, we examined the accessibility of Cys-430 to labeling by MTS-4-fluorescein, a fluorescent MTS reagent. As with the other MTS reagents, MTS-4-fluorescein irreversibly activated BNC1-G430C at pH 5 (Fig. 5 A). After labeling, confocal microscopy showed patchy areas of cell-surface fluorescence (Fig. 5, B and E) that may suggest organization and localization by association with cytosolic or membrane structures. In contrast, uninjected oocytes or oocytes expressing wild-type BNC1 had only a small amount of diffuse background fluorescence (Fig. 5, C and E). In addition, oocytes expressing BNC1-G430C that were labeled at pH 7.4 had only a small amount of diffuse fluorescence (Fig. 5, D and E), indicating that labeling required activation by protons. These results are consistent with the electrophysiologic data showing that Cys-430 was accessible to MTS compounds only when the channel was activated. In addition, the ability to selectively modify open channels with a fluorescent MTS reagent provides a novel reporter of the cell surface localization and functional status of these channels. These data indicate that protons induce a reversible conformational change to activate BNC1 and expose the Deg residue. Fig. 6 shows a schematic of a potential mechanism suggested by the results; we model BNC1 activation as a synchronous rotation of channel subunits based on studies of another ligand-gated channel, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (23Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). In this model, protons bind a regulatory site to reversibly rotate the channel subunits. The rotation would have two effects. It would reversibly open the pore to allow current flow. As a consequence, it would also move residue 430 from a buried position to one facing the extracellular environment where it can be irreversibly modified by MTS compounds. Modification of residue 430 with a bulky side chain would sterically hinder rotation of the subunits back to a closed state that buries residue 430. Thus, following modification, the channel would be locked in an open state. This model can also explain the finding that introduction of large amino acids at the Deg position constitutively activates several DEG/ENaC channels (12Chalfie M. Wolinsky E. Nature. 1990; 345: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 14Huang M. Chalfie M.

Estrogen-induced peroxisome proliferation has been observed in an estrogen target tissue, the uropygial gland in the duck. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this process, we previously isolated the cDNA of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ1 (PPARγ1) from the duck uropygial gland and found that its expression was high exclusively in this tissue of duck. However, the nature of the ligand for PPARγ1 and how estrogen might enhance PPARγ1-regulated gene expression were not known. Here we demonstrate that estrogen treatment of animals enhanced the metabolism of arachidonic acid in the uropygial gland. Conversion of prostaglandin D2 to a metabolite was induced by estradiol treatment preceding peroxisome proliferation. High performance liquid chromatography and TLC analyses showed that the metabolite behaved chromatographically similar to prostaglandin J2 and Δ12-prostaglandin J2. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed a striking similarity of the metabolite to Δ12-prostaglandin J2, the only form among the J2 series whose natural occurrence has been detected. Furthermore, this metabolite was able to activate duck PPARγ1 to the same extent as the same concentrations of Δ12-prostaglandin J2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, whereas under the same conditions, prostaglandin D2 was not effective.

Ishibashi M. Sudo M. Miyazaki H. Fukushima M. Narumiya S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As cyclopentenone prostaglandins, the J2 series have no membrane receptor, but are actively incorporated to the nucleus (17Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujimara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar), making them good candidates for natural ligands for PPARγ. However, the metabolism of Δ12-prostaglandin J2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 has not been studied extensively, and whether they are synthesized in PPARγ-expressing tissues is unknown. We have isolated duck PPARγ cDNA and have shown that PPARγ1 is highly and specifically expressed in the duck uropygial gland. Since the expression of duck PPARγ is not induced by estrogen at the mRNA level (18Ma H. Quach T. Kolattukudy P.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it appeared possible that estrogens may act as ligands for PPARγ1. We report that estrogen is not highly effective as a ligand for PPARγ1. Thus, an indirect role for estrogen in peroxisome proliferation, possibly involving induction of synthesis of an effective ligand for PPARγ1, was suspected. Since estrogen is known to influence prostaglandin synthesis in tissues that are estrogen targets (19Ham E.A. Cirilio V.J. Zanetti M.E. Kuehl Jr., F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that estrogen may cause peroxisome proliferation indirectly by the production of a prostaglandin ligand for PPAR. Here we report that estrogen treatment of mallard ducks induced enzymatic conversion of prostaglandin D2 to a new metabolite in the uropygial gland preceding peroxisome proliferation. This metabolite is shown to be as potent an activator of PPARγ1 as the prostaglandin J2 series. TLC, HPLC, and GC/MS analyses provide compelling evidence suggesting that the prostaglandin D2 metabolite is extremely similar to Δ12-prostaglandin J2. Our results demonstrate for the first time that in response to estradiol treatment, a potent activator of PPARγ1 is produced in a tissue where PPARγ1 is expressed at a high level and where peroxisome proliferation occurs in response to estrogen treatment. [5,6,8,9,12,14,15-3H7]Prostaglandin D2 (115 Ci/mmol) and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (230 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Prostaglandins were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). 17β-Estradiol, estriol, estrone, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The 1–2-year-old female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) obtained from Whistling Wings were kept in outdoor cages on a high-energy breeder ration and injected daily with 1 mg of 17β-estradiol benzoate (17β-estradiol benzoate was dissolved in 2.5% ethanol in olive oil). The control ducks were injected only with the ethanol/olive oil mixture. The frozen duck uropygial gland (200 mg) was homogenized with a Brinkmann homogenizer in 2.5 ml of 0.05m Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). One ml of the homogenate was incubated at 37 °C with constant shaking for various periods of time with 0.5 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid or with 2.0 μCi of [3H]prostaglandin D2. For large-scale production of prostaglandin D2 metabolites, 2–10 mg of unlabeled prostaglandin D2 was included in the reaction mixture along with [3H]prostaglandin D2. The reaction was terminated by adding 3 ml of ethanol, and the mixture was kept at room temperature for 5 min. Then, 16 ml of water was added to adjust the final concentration of ethanol to 15%. The mixture was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further acidified to pH 3.0 with 1 n HCl. Sep-Pak vac RC C18 cartridges (Waters Associates) were used to isolate eicosanoids from the incubation mixtures as described (25Powell W.S. Prostaglandins. 1980; 20: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Sep-Pak cartridges were conditioned before loading the samples; the fractions of eicosanoids were eluted with methyl formate; and the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen. The dried material was dissolved in methyl formate or ethanol for subsequent studies. The gland tissue was homogenized in ice-cold ethanol, and prostaglandins were recovered as described previously (26Gaudet R.J. Alam I. Levine L. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The level of endogenous prostaglandin D2was measured with the [3H]prostaglandin D2assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the competition method recommended by the manufacturer. The prostaglandin preparation was resuspended in 500 μl of diluted assay buffer, and 30 μl of this mixture was used in the assay. The standards or samples were incubated with tracer and antiserum at 4 °C overnight, and the free prostaglandin D2 was adsorbed onto dextran-coated charcoal. The concentrations of endogenous prostaglandin D2 were obtained by referring to the standard curve. TLC was carried out on Whatman linear-K TLC plates with a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (90:5:2). The prostaglandins were visualized under UV light after spraying the plates with a 0.1% ethanolic solution of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein. The plates were also scanned to measure the radioactivity using a Berthold automatic TLC linear analyzer. In some cases, the silica gels representing TLC fractions were also scraped and directly assayed for radioactivity in a Beckman LS3801 scintillation counter. HPLC was performed on a 5-μm Lichrosorb RP-18 column (250 × 4.6 mm; Alltech Associates, Inc.) using a Hewlett-Packard 1090 liquid chromatography system. The UV detection range was 190–400 nm. The elution program was a 15-min linear gradient of 30% acetonitrile in water, a 5-min linear gradient to 50% acetonitrile, and a 25-min isocratic elution at that acetonitrile concentration. This was followed by a 5-min linear gradient to 73% acetonitrile and a final isocratic elution. All solvents contained 0.1% acetic acid. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the eluate was collected in 0.5-ml fractions. An aliquot from each fraction was assayed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. The methyl ester and trimethylsilyl ether derivatives were prepared by treatment of the compounds with ethereal diazomethane for 10 min and further with 25 μl of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide/dimethylformamide (1:1) for 10 min at room temperature. GC/MS analysis was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph and a Hewlett-Packard 5972 mass spectrometer with a 30-m Hewlett-Packard 5ms column. Injections were made in the splitless mode at 70 °C. After 3 min, the oven temperature was increased to 240 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min. The mammalian expression vector of the chicken estrogen receptor (CERO) was kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon (Institut de Chimie Biologique, Strasbourg, France). The pCMX-mRXRα vector and the mouse PPARα expression vector pCMX-mPPARα were kindly provided by Dr. Ronald M. Evans (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). The EcoRI fragment of duck PPARγ1 cDNA was subcloned to the EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Two complementary 39-mer oligonucleotides representing the PPRE of the rat fatty acyl-CoA oxidase promoter with BglII site overhangs were synthesized, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and annealed to and subcloned to the BglII site of the pGL2 promoter that contains an SV40 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene (Promega). The clone that contained three consecutive copies of the PPRE was identified by screening and sequencing and was used in transfection experiments as the PPRE-containing reporter vector. NIH 3T3 cells were grown routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose and 10% calf serum and switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red and with 2% dextran-coated charcoal-treated calf serum prior to transfection. On the next day, the 60–80% confluent cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 35-mm plates. In each transfection reaction, 2 μg of DNA was used, including 200 ng of each receptor or reporter expression plasmid and 1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector. pBluescript plasmid was used to make up the total amount of DNA to 2 μg/reaction. After 5 h, the ligands were added and replaced on the following day. After 48 h, the cells were washed and harvested. The cell lysates were prepared by three to four cycles of freezing and thawing. Luciferase expression was standardized against an internal standard of β-galactosidase. We recently isolated a PPARγ1 cDNA clone from the duck uropygial gland, and this PPARγ1 was found to be highly expressed specifically in the duck gland tissue (18Ma H. Quach T. Kolattukudy P.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To test whether 17β-estradiol or any of its metabolites elicit a direct response with duck PPARγ1, duck PPARγ1 was expressed transiently in NIH 3T3 cells, and estrogens were tested as added ligands. The results show that at a high concentration (20 μm), 17β-estradiol consistently led to a higher response through duck PPARγ1 than at a low concentration (0.2 μm) (Fig. 1, Aand B). The observed induction was usually ∼2-fold. Other 17β-estradiol metabolites, including estriol and estrone, were also tested, but no induction of reporter gene expression was observed (Fig. 1 B). Cotransfection with retinoic acid X receptor α caused a significant enhancement of the induction of the target gene caused by estradiol at all concentrations (Fig. 1 A). Since estradiol caused only ∼2-fold induction with PPARγ1 alone, it appeared unlikely that direct estrogen activation of PPARγ was adequate to account for peroxisome proliferation in the uropygial gland. Since the ER was found earlier to be expressed in the duck uropygial gland, 2L. S. Hiremath and P. E. Kolattukudy, unpublished data. we tested the possibility that estradiol may be a ligand for a heterodimer of duck PPARγ1 and the ER, which might in turn induce peroxisome proliferation. The addition of the ER to the transfection assays appeared to improve the induction of the target gene by various ligands, albeit to a small degree (Fig. 1 C). The effect was greater when a high concentration (10 μm) of 17β-estradiol was present. However, the presence of PPARγ and the ER gave a higher stimulation than that obtained with either alone, but the effect was additive rather than synergistic, suggesting that it is unlikely that the estradiol response involved heterodimers of PPARγ and the ER. The higher level of response to estradiol was probably due to its effect through binding to the ER, rather than conversion to other metabolites. Since it was reported that selective groups of eicosanoids were able to activate PPARs differentially (14Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that estrogen might induce the formation of a prostaglandin ligand for PPAR in the duck uropygial gland. Initially, we tested whether arachidonic acid metabolism in uropygial glands was enhanced by estrogen treatment of the animals. 3H-Labeled arachidonic acid was incubated with the homogenates of glands from control animals and from animals treated for 9 days with estradiol, and the metabolic products were extracted and examined by TLC. The results (Fig. 2) show that the homogenates of untreated uropygial glands generated polar metabolites from arachidonic acid. The extracts of the glands from estrogen-treated ducks converted a much higher portion of arachidonic acid to metabolites, clearly showing that estrogen treatment significantly enhanced arachidonic acid metabolism. Prostaglandin D2 is the immediate precursor of the prostaglandin J2 series, including Δ12-prostaglandin J2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, which have been reported to be activators of PPARγ (14Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the level of endogenous prostaglandin D2 in the duck uropygial gland changes as a result of estrogen treatment of the animals. Radioimmunoassays for prostaglandin D2 levels after treatment of the animals with estradiol for different periods of time showed that after the first 9 days of treatment, the level of prostaglandin D2 decreased to less than half of the original level, and then the level started to go up, approaching the starting level with extended estrogen treatment of the animals when the peroxisome level is known to have reached a maximal level (Fig. 3) (2Bohnet S. Rogers L. Sasaki G. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9795-9804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The measured values are net levels of prostaglandin D2, reflecting both the production and the catabolism or clearance of prostaglandin D2. Therefore, the changes in the prostaglandin D2 level could indicate decreased production or increased metabolism of prostaglandin D2. The composition of the gland secretion changed due to the estradiol treatment. First, long chain fatty acid esters began to appear together with the usual short chain acid esters, and subsequently, the entire secretion was composed of long chain esters prior to the appearance of diesters, the characteristic products of the peroxisomes. The observed changes in the level of prostaglandin D2 could be directly related to estrogen-induced peroxisome proliferation in the duck uropygial gland since the lowest level of prostaglandin D2 was reached after 9 days of estrogen treatment, preceding the appearance of 3-hydroxy fatty acid diesters produced by the peroxisomes (Fig. 3) (2Bohnet S. Rogers L. Sasaki G. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9795-9804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the decrease in prostaglandin D2 caused by estrogen treatment represents increased conversion of the prostaglandin to metabolites, we incubated3H-labeled prostaglandin D2 with homogenates of glands and examined the products using TLC. The results revealed that prostaglandin D2 was converted to a single major product in 30 min by homogenates of glands from animals treated with estrogen for 9 days (Fig. 4 A). Very little product was detectable with buffer alone. A small amount of product was found after incubation with extracts of control glands from untreated animals. With the homogenates of glands from animals that had been treated with estrogen for 6 days, almost half of the prostaglandin D2 was converted to the metabolite after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 4 B); with boiled gland homogenates, virtually no conversion of the prostaglandin occurred, showing that the conversion of prostaglandin D2to the observed product was an enzyme-catalyzed process. The homogenates from animals treated with estrogen for 9 days converted prostaglandin D2 almost completely to the metabolite, whereas with gland homogenates from animals treated for 18 days, the production of the prostaglandin D2 metabolite decreased to the control level (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, the conversion of prostaglandin D2 to its metabolite during estrogen treatment was inversely correlated with the changes in the endogenous prostaglandin D2 level, suggesting that the decreased level of prostaglandin D2 probably was due to the enhanced conversion of prostaglandin D2 to its metabolite. It has been reported previously that during mating season, the composition of the lipids secreted by the female duck uropygial gland undergoes specific changes (2Bohnet S. Rogers L. Sasaki G. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9795-9804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoesters of short chain fatty acids are replaced by long chain fatty acid monoesters, followed by the appearance of unique diesters of 3-hydroxy fatty acids that are thought to be pheromones (2Bohnet S. Rogers L. Sasaki G. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9795-9804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that with gland tissue, which was producing short chain fatty acid monoesters, overnight incubation of the homogenate with prostaglandin D2 did not result in detectable conversion to its metabolite (Fig. 5 A). We tested the ability of the gland at each stage to produce the prostaglandin D2metabolite by incubating gland homogenates with 250 μg of prostaglandin D2. With homogenates of glands producing short chain monoesters, very little metabolite was formed (Fig. 5 A). With homogenates of glands that were at the stage preceding the appearance of long chain fatty acid monoesters, specific production of the prostaglandin D2 metabolite was observed with overnight incubation (Fig. 5 B). With the extracts of glands that were at the stage preceding diester formation, overnight incubation resulted in an increased level of conversion of prostaglandin D2 (Fig. 5 C), although these long incubations were not done for actual rate measurements. With the high level of prostaglandin D2 (250 μg), complete conversion was not seen in any case with overnight incubation. Compared with short incubation times, more minor products were obtained with the overnight incubation. When the prostaglandin D2 metabolite extracted from the duck uropygial glands was compared with various prostaglandin standards by TLC, the metabolite showed the sameR F value as prostaglandin J2 and Δ12-prostaglandin J2, but theR F was clearly different from those of the members of the F series (Table I). HPLC analysis showed that the duck metabolite was eluted at ∼39 min, whereas prostaglandin J2 and Δ12-prostaglandin J2 were eluted between 39 and 40 min (Table I). To date, there are two known pathways for prostaglandin D2conversion to other prostaglandins. One is the in vitrospontaneous dehydration of prostaglandin D2 into prostaglandin J2 (27Fukushima M.

The other is the in vivo stereospecific reduction of prostaglandin D2 to 9α,11β-prostaglandin F2 catalyzed by NADPH-dependent 11-keto-reductase and the further conversion to 15-keto-9α,11β-prostaglandin F2 and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-9α,11β-prostaglandin F2 in the presence of NAD+ (31Hoult J.R.

Open table in a new tab To facilitate structural analysis of the prostaglandin D2metabolite produced by the gland extract, we used a larger amount of unlabeled prostaglandin D2 along with a trace amount of3H-labeled prostaglandin D2 in the overnight incubation study. HPLC fractionation of the products showed that the prostaglandin J2-like metabolite appeared to be the predominant product detected by UV absorbance and the presence of3H. The fractions showing the highest level of radioactivity were combined, and the UV spectrum was obtained. The UV spectrum showed a single absorbance peak at 225 nm, which was slightly shorter than the λmax (248 nm) of Δ12-prostaglandin J2, but much shorter than the λmax (307 nm) of 15-deoxy-Δ12, 14-prostaglandin J2 (Fig. 6). When the prostaglandin D2metabolite was subjected to GC/MS as the trimethylsilyl ether derivative of the methyl ester, a major peak emerged with a retention time of ∼19 min under conditions in which the standard Δ12-prostaglandin J2 derivative had the same retention time, and prostaglandin J2 showed a retention time of 17 min. The endogenous compound from the duck gland could be co-eluted with the product generated from exogenous prostaglandin D2 during HPLC and GC. The mass spectrum of the prostaglandin D2 metabolite isolated from the gland extract showed a striking similarity to that of standard Δ12-prostaglandin J2 (Fig. 7 A and B).

Although several cellular processes are known to be mediated through the tubulin-microtubule system, the participation of tubulin or microtubule in protein folding pathway has not yet been reported. Here we show that goat brain tubulin has some functions and features similar to many known molecular chaperones. Substoichiometric amounts of tubulin can suppress the non-thermal and thermal aggregation of a number of unrelated proteins such as insulin, equine liver alcohol dehydrogenase, and soluble eye lens proteins containing β- and γ-crystallins. This chaperone-like activity of tubulin becomes more pronounced as temperature increases. Aging of tubulin solution at 37 °C also enhances its chaperone-like activity. Tubulin loses its chaperone-like activity upon removal of its flexible hydrophilic C-terminal tail. These results suggest that both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are important in substrate binding by tubulin and that the negatively charged C-terminal tails play a crucial role for its chaperone-like activity.

Although it is the amino acid sequence of a protein that determines its final three-dimensional structure of the functional form, it is now well established that many proteins in vivoas well as in vitro fail to fold correctly in the active form without the aid from a class of proteins known as molecular chaperones (1Gething M.J.

During the process of their synthesis, translocation, and even during normal functioning in the cell (particularly under stress conditions) proteins are often subjected to structural destabilization. Such conditions are likely to lead to an increase in the propensity for proteins to aggregate, leading to the ultimate death of the biopolymers. Chaperones rescue these unstable conformers by binding to them and eventually through a concerted steps of events, often involving appropriate co-factors and even other molecular chaperones, guide the substrate proteins to the correct folded structure (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar, 3Ruddon R.W. Bedows E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones occur ubiquitously in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, archaebacterial cytosol, and chloroplasts (2Hartl F.U.

They comprise several protein families, which are structurally unrelated. These classes of proteins includes GroEL, BiP, GRP, TRAP, TRiC, DnaJ gene products, and heat shock proteins such as HSP40, HSP70, HSP90, etc. Molecular chaperones are now known to perform diverse functions not only helping substrate proteins to fold properly but also helping attain the correct fate of the protein in vivo, be it proper oligomeric assembly, transport to a particular subcellular compartment, or disposal of unwanted protein by degradation (1Gething M.J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding Factors. Sambrook and Tooze at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar, 5Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Different chaperones thus have different functions and they act sequentially (4Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, irrespective of their functions, their action requires a common step of binding the unstable non-native conformation of the substrate, preventing the off-pathway reaction that leads to protein aggregation. The structural features of a protein that make it a chaperone are poorly understood. However, a close observation of the molecular chaperones known up to today reveals some interesting facts. They have a domain containing a bundle of hydrophobic residues suitably located at the surface of the protein enabling it to bind lipophilic substances such as 1-anilinonapthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) or 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5-disulfonic acid, dipotassium salt (bis-ANS) (6Martin J.

Most known chaperones, e.g. GroEL, DnaK, α-crystallin, etc., also have a flexible hydrophilic tail, the absence of which leads to loss of chaperone activity (9Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R.

Because of these well separated hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, many chaperones exist as a micelle-like large oligomeric form. GroEL exists as a 14-mer (9Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R.

Proposed oligomeric structures of α-crystallin that have chaperone-like activity (13Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tubulin is a cytoskeleton protein that polymerizes to form microtubules. Folding of tubulin in cytoskeleton is assisted by the chaperone TCP-1 ring complex, also known as TRiC (16Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 17Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell.

A. 1993; 90: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Tubulin in general seems to have some of the essential characteristics of a chaperone protein such as surface hydrophobic pockets to bind lipophilic molecules (19Prasad A.R.S. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Ward L.D. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11891-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a flexible hydrophilic tail especially rich in acidic residues (21Ponstingel H. Krauhs E. Little M. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1983; 15: 359-362Google Scholar), and a heterodimeric assembly of two subunits, α and β (M r 50,000 each), which can further polymerize into microtubules. These features prompted us to test whether tubulin possesses any chaperone-like activity. The results presented in this communication reveal for the first time that tubulin has chaperone-like properties as it can prevent the aggregation of a number of proteins unrelated in structure or sequence. PIPES,1EGTA, GTP, insulin, subtilisin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), dithiothreitol (DTT), and alcohol dehydrogenase from equine liver were obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Tubulin was isolated from goat brains by two cycles of GTP and temperature-dependent assembly and disassembly in buffer containing 50 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.0) followed by two further cycles in 1 m glutamate buffer (22Hamel E. Lin C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The purified tubulin freed from microtubule-associated proteins was extensively dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer to remove any trace of glutamate and stored in aliquots at −70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Freshly excised bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. The lenses were surgically removed and homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. A water-soluble fraction was obtained from the supernatant by centrifuging the homogenate at 27,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 100-kDa polysulfone membrane using an Amicon stirred cell. The filtrate thus collected was α-crystallin-depleted soluble lens protein, containing a mixture of γ-crystallin and low molecular weight β-crystallin and other minor constituents of soluble lens proteins. Insulin dissolved in a minimum volume of 0.02 m NaOH was diluted to the required concentration (0.3 mg/ml) in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The reduction of insulin was initiated by adding 20 μl of 1m DTT to 1 ml of the sample in the spectrophotometric cuvette, and the extent of aggregation of the insulin B chain was measured as a function of time at 25 °C by monitoring the apparent absorbance (scattering) at 360 nm in a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer. Thermally induced aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase and soluble lens protein fractions were also measured in the same spectrophotometer using a thermostatic cell holder assembly maintained at constant temperature through a circulating water bath. Protein solution and buffer were mixed in the cuvette at room temperature and then placed in the thermostatic cell holder, and apparent absorbance was measured as function of time. For calculating the molar ratio of protein:tubulin resulting in nearly complete protection of aggregation, the molecular masses of tubulin, insulin, alcohol dehydrogenase, and α-crystallin-depleted soluble lens protein were taken as 100, 5.7, 80, and 60 kDa, respectively, of which the last one is an average value for the protein mixtures and not unambiguous (13Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Digestion of tubulin with subtilisin was performed at 30 °C in 100 mm phosphate buffer with 1 mm GTP. Subtilisin was taken in the ratio enzyme:protein = 1:100 (w/w). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1% by volume of 1% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in Me2SO. Insulin and alcohol dehydrogenase were used as substrates to study chaperone-like activity of many proteins including α-crystallin and HSP proteins. Aggregation of both insulin and alcohol dehydrogenase is suppressed when incubated in the presence of α-crystallin or HSP proteins (24Muchouski P.J. Bassuk J.A. Lubsen N.H. Clark J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2578-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Smulders R.H.P.H. Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. van Boekel M.A.M. Bloemendal H. dejong W.W. J. Biol.

Reduction of the disulfide bonds between the A and B chains of insulin with dithiothreitol rapidly leads to the aggregation of B chains. To investigate the function of goat brain tubulin, the aggregation of insulin (0.3 mg/ml) in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was monitored at 25 °C in the absence and presence of varied amounts of goat brain tubulin. As shown in Fig. 1 A, curve 1, insulin lost its native conformation upon cleavage of its disulfide bond at 25 °C. Denaturation was accompanied by aggregation. Bovine serum albumin had virtually no effect on the aggregation of insulin (data not shown). When the same experiment was performed in the presence of goat brain tubulin, aggregation was suppressed. At an insulin to tubulin weight ratio of 1:1, aggregation was significantly reduced (Fig. 1 A, curve 2). At an insulin to tubulin weight ratio of 1:8, the aggregation was almost completely suppressed (Fig. 1 A, curve 3). There was no evidence of any aggregation at a 1:10 weight ratio (data not shown). This complete prevention of aggregation corresponds to a stoichiometric ratio of 1:0.6 for insulin:tubulin. Thermal aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase was carried out at 37 °C. Tubulin showed a pronounced effect on the prevention of aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase, and at the alcohol dehydrogenase to tubulin weight ratio of 1:1 corresponding to a stoichiometric ratio of 1:0.8, 80% suppression of aggregation occurred (Fig. 1 B, curve 3). It is known that α-crystallin acts as a molecular chaperone on a native mixture of lens proteins (13Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Thus the absence of α-crystallin from the total soluble protein fraction of lens homogenate (consisting of γ-crystallin and low molecular weight β-crystallin fractions and all other low molecular weight soluble components) caused thermal aggregation at 60 °C (13Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Addition of α-crystallin to the soluble lens protein fraction prevented the thermal aggregation. We have tested the effect of tubulin on the thermal aggregation of soluble lens proteins devoid of α-crystallin at 60 °C (Fig. 2). Tubulin showed a pronounced effect on the suppression of aggregation of soluble lens protein fraction even at a weight ratio of lens protein:tubulin as low as 1:0.2 (Fig. 2). Complete suppression of aggregation required the lens proteins:tubulin weight ratio of 1:0.5, corresponding to a stoichiometric ratio of 1:0.3. Chaperone-like activity of many proteins become more pronounced at a higher temperature. The heat shock protein, HSP90, and α-crystallin bind more effectively to unfolded substrate proteins in the thermally modified form (7Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 26Surewicz W.K. Olesen P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9655-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Raman W.K.

We have studied the prevention of thermal aggregation of insulin at 25 °C by tubulin, which was first incubated at 50 °C and then brought back to 25 °C. At an insulin:tubulin ratio of 1:1 (w/w) the prevention of aggregation by control insulin is 50% at 25 °C (Fig. 3 A, curve 2). However, when tubulin preincubated at 50 °C was used in the same weight ratio, almost complete prevention of aggregation occurs (Fig. 3 A, curve 3). We have also tested the effectiveness of tubulin preincubated alone at 37 °C for different periods of times (aged or thermally modified tubulin) to prevent the aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase. Results of such an experiment are shown in Fig. 3 B. Experiments were carried out at an insulin to tubulin weight ratio of 1:1 (molar ratio, ∼1:0.06) at 25 °C. Tubulins used were native and 1, 2, 3, and 4 h aged at 37 °C. Although native tubulin inhibits 50% aggregation of insulin at 25 °C, prevention is much more with aged tubulin (Fig. 3 B). Thermal treatment of tubulin and its aging at 37 °C are known to expose hydrophobic sites leading to enhanced binding of hydrophobic probes (19Prasad A.R.S. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Ward L.D. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11891-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is suggested that molecular chaperones suppress aggregation by providing appropriately placed hydrophobic surfaces to the denaturing protein substrates. Our observation of enhanced activity of thermally modified tubulin (Fig. 3 B, inset) also indicates a direct correlation of chaperone-like activity with exposure of surface hydrophobic groups. One of the characteristics of many known chaperones is the existence of a flexible tail region. GroEL is known to have flexible N- and C-terminal residues, which protrude in the central cavity and because of their flexibility are not resolved in the crystal structure (9Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). It was shown by NMR spectroscopy that α-crystallin and HSP25 have unstructured, flexible, and solvent-exposed C-terminal extensions (25Smulders R.H.P.H. Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. van Boekel M.A.M. Bloemendal H. dejong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the polar and unstructured flexible C-terminal end plays a critical role in substrate-chaperone interactions and also functions as a solubilizer. In fact, mutation in the C-terminal end, deletion of 17 residues from the C-terminal end (10Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), or enzymatic truncation of the C terminus caused a marked reduction in chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin (29Kelly M.J. David L.L. Iwasaki N. Wright J. Shearer T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18844-18849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Takemoto L. Exp. Eye. Res. 1992; 59: 239-242Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). C termini of both α- and β-subunits of tubulin are rich in acidic residues, especially glutamic acid (21Ponstingel H. Krauhs E. Little M. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1983; 15: 359-362Google Scholar). Because of the highest negative charge density, both termini are exposed to solvents, susceptible to proteolysis, and thought to be highly flexible (31Sackett D.L. Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 43-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bhattacharyya B. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10208-10216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subtilisin can cleave both C termini when incubated with tubulin at 37 °C. Thus, the obvious question is does the removal of C termini of tubulin change its chaperone-like activity? The results of such an experiment are shown in Fig. 4. Tubulin lost its chaperone-like activity when the C termini of both subunits (αsβs) are removed using subtilisin (Fig. 4). It is interesting to note that complete loss of chaperone-like activity needs removal of the C terminus from both the subunits. When the digestion is partial (Fig. 4, curve 3), tubulin retains some chaperone-like activity. The functional significance of this finding is not clear at present. In eukaryotic cytosol, folding of proteins including tubulin and actin is mediated by the chaperonin TRiC (16Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 17Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Sternlicht H. Farr G.W. Sternlicht M.L. Driscoll J.K. Wilson K. Yaffe M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). TRiC is known to be present in all eukaryotic cytosol (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). Although TRiC has a double cylindrical architecture very similar to that of GroEL, it is known to mediate the folding of only a very limited subset of proteins including tubulin and actin. This is in sharp contrast to the generally wide selectivity of GroEL (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of TRiC in many cell types is quite low (5Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). There is also no evidence to date for the other abundant chaperones in the eukaryotic cytosol such as HSP90 to play any significant role in protein folding (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). It is therefore an open question as to how the majority of the proteins in the eukaryotic cytosol fold. Our finding of the chaperone-like activity of tubulin may have some role in the formation or maintenance of native conformation of cytosolic proteins. The answer to the question whether tubulin itself helps the proteins to fold or just holds the polypeptide temporarily before being taken up by TRiC or some other hitherto unknown chaperone to guide the substrates through folding awaits further study. In summary, we have identified tubulin as having a chaperone-like function. Like GroEL, HSPs, small HSPs, and other members of the molecular chaperone family, tubulin is able to prevent the irreversible aggregation of proteins under heat shock as well as other conditions. Like other chaperones, its activity increases with a rise of temperature. Its activity is sensitive to the deletion of its flexible hydrophilic tail, a feature known also for other chaperones."

In addition to the Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains 1 and 2 and the transmembrane sequence, Bok also has a BH3 domain believed to be important for dimerization with selective antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and cell killing. We identified a splicing variant of Bok mRNA with a deletion of 43 residues from the full-length protein (Bok-L), leading to the fusion of the N-terminal-half of its BH3 domain to the C-terminal-half of the BH1 domain. Genomic analysis indicated that the Bok has five exons, and the short form of Bok (Bok-S) represents the splicing out of exon three during transcription. Although Bok-S retains the apoptosis-inducing activity in transfected cells, it has lost the ability to dimerize with antiapoptotic proteins in vitro. Additional BH3 domain mutations of Bok-L also led to defective heterodimerization without affecting its proapoptotic action. Furthermore, similar deletions for the related channel-forming proapoptotic Bax and Bak did not impair their cell killing ability.

Apoptotic cell death is critical for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in a healthy organism as well as for pathogenesis during diseased states including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases, and viral infection (1Thompson C.B.

Bok shares the conserved domains BH1, 2, and 3 with other proapoptotic proteins but lacks the BH4 domain found in some antiapoptotic proteins. Unlike several proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, Bok does not interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL but preferentially dimerizes with antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bfl-1, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-derived BHRF1. Although the mechanism by which Bok promotes cell death is unknown, its distinct heterodimerization property and tissue distribution pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that apoptosis is regulated by tissue-specific Bcl-2 protein pairs (20Hsu S.Y.

Because Bok is homologous to Bax and Bak in BH domain arrangement and secondary structure, the Bok protein could regulate apoptosis through dimerization with antiapoptotic proteins, a mechanism originally proposed for the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak (6Oltvai Z.N.

Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar).During the analysis of Bok mRNA and gene structure, we found a Bok splicing variant in which the region encoded by exon three is absent, suggesting the existence of a truncated short form (Bok-S) of the full-length Bok protein (Bok-L). The skipping of exon three maintained the original reading frame and retained the BH2 and the C-terminal membrane-anchoring domains; however, parts of the BH3 and BH1 domains were deleted. Of interest, functional analysis indicated that Bok-S is still capable of inducing apoptosis, suggesting that an intact BH3 domain of Bok is not essential for apoptosis regulation. In addition, the truncated Bok has lost its ability to heterodimerize with Mcl-1, BHRF-1, and Bfl-1, suggesting that the proapoptotic activity of this variant could not be mediated by its binding to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Similar to Bok-S, mutants of related proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak with their homologous BH3-BH1 region deleted also retained proapoptotic activity, suggesting a common mechanism of action shared by this subgroup of proapoptotic proteins. Our results define a novel splicing form of the Bok gene and demonstrate that this naturally occurring variant without a conserved BH3 domain could induce apoptosis but does not dimerize with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in vitro.DiscussionsWe have identified a naturally occurring variant of Bok with proapoptotic activity but exhibiting negligible dimerization with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members. Bok-S with a 43-amino acid deletion between the BH3 and BH1 domains was likely the result of alternative mRNA splicing, leading to the skipping of exon three during post-transcriptional modification. Analysis of Bok variants and Bok mutants with alterations in the BH3 domain indicated that the BH3 domain of Bok-L is critical for heterodimerization but dispensable for apoptosis induction. Likewise, similar deletions between BH3 and BH1 domains of the homologous proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak also retained cell killing ability. Thus, Bok-L could promote apoptosis independent of heterodimerization, and Bok-S represents a novel proapoptotic Bcl-2 member capable of inducing cell death without binding to or interference by antiapoptotic Bcl-2 partners. This functional Bok variant with retention of the region spanning BH1 and BH2 domains and the TM sequence provides a unique model for further studies of apoptosis mechanisms regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins.The bifunctional antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins play a pivotal role in the decision step of apoptosis (2Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar).

Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Because several mutants of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL lost both antiapoptotic activity and the ability to bind proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, it is believed that dimerization of Bcl-2 protein pairs mediated by the consensus BH domains is important in apoptosis regulation. Crystallographic studies and computer modeling showed that the conserved BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of Bcl-xL and related proteins constitute an elongated hydrophobic cleft (15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M.

Upon heterodimerization, anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 partners antagonize the actions of the other (29Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B.

It is likely that one of the mechanisms by which Bok-L exerts its proapoptotic action is through dimerization with antiapoptotic partners (20Hsu S.Y. Kaipia A. McGee E. Lomeli M. Hsueh A.J.W. Proc.

Together with Bax and Bak, Bok-L belongs to the first subgroup showing the conserved BH1, BH2, BH3, and TM domains. In contrast, members of the second subgroup (BAD, BID, Hrk/DP5, Bik/Nbk, and Bim/BOD) possess only the BH3 domain, with or without the TM region (2Reed J.C.

More recent studies, however, demonstrated that Bax, like Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, also shows intrinsic ion channel activity in the artificial membrane (19Schlesinger P.H. Gross A. Yin X.M. Yamamoto K.

In addition, mutations in the BH1, 2, or 3 domains of Bax do not affect its ability to promote apoptosis (37Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

These data suggest that the first subgroup of proapoptotic proteins, including Bax, Bak, and Bok, could induce apoptosis through channel formation in addition to their role as ligands for antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (2Reed J.C.

Because the second BH3-only subgroup members lack the region spanning BH1 and BH2 domains important for pore formation and mainly reside in the cytoplasm, they are believed to serve as ligands or facilitators of the pore forming Bcl-2 proteins.Our findings that substitution of conserved residues in the BH3 domain of Bok-L abates its ability to dimerize with antiapoptotic proteins are in accord with studies on the BH3 domain of its proapoptotic homologues (31Chittenden T.

Similarly, truncation of the conserved BH3 domain in the naturally occurring Bok-S variant also disrupted heterodimerization but retained cell killing ability, indicating the BH3 domain is dispensable for apoptosis induction. Thus, Bok-S represents a new form of proapoptotic protein consisting of only minimal functional modules and manifesting proapoptotic action without direct interactions with antiapoptotic proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, C-E, truncation of the region between BH3 and BH1 from Bok-L does not affect the homologous α5 and α6 regions proposed to be important for channel formation in Bax (19Schlesinger P.H. Gross A. Yin X.M. Yamamoto K. Saito M. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11357-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In addition, the hydropathicity property between the 5′-end of the BH1 region and the C-terminal TM domain is not altered by the truncation found in Bok-S. It is likely that the BH3/1, BH2, and TM domains found in Bok-S comprise a module sufficient for mediating apoptosis through a heterodimerization-independent pathway. Future studies on the channel-forming property of the naturally occurring Bok-S and other channel-forming Bcl-2 proteins are important for understanding the mechanisms of apoptosis. The channel-forming hypothesis is further supported by the finding that Bax-S and Bak-S with truncation at the BH3-BH1 regions homologous to that of Bok-S also retain proapoptotic activity. Recent studies also indicated that, during apoptosis, activated caspases cleave the N-terminal BH4 domain of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to yield truncated molecules resembling the proapoptotic Bax, Bak or Bok in terms of the BH domain arrangement (28Clem R.J.

Of interest, deletion of the BH4 domain from these antiapoptotic proteins confers proapoptotic activity and mitochondrial release of cytochrome C, presumably mediated through the C-terminal channel-forming region (28Clem R.J.

The Bcl-xL gene encodes three different variants, each with a distinct function; the long form of Bcl-x (L) exhibits antiapoptotic activity, whereas Bcl-x-short and Bcl-x-β are proapoptotic (45Boise L.H.

Because Bok-S does not interact with antiapoptotic proteins, apoptosis mediated through Bok-S may be important in situations when unwanted cells need to be eliminated quickly despite the presence of antiapoptotic proteins in the same cell.

We have expressed and purified recombinant human wild type (hWT) and G93A (hG93A) CuZn-SOD, and we have used pulse radiolysis to measure their superoxide dismutase activities and their rates of deactivation upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide or heat. Both hG93A and hWT CuZn-SOD were found to have high SOD activities in their copper and zinc containing as-isolated forms as well as when remetallated entirely with copper (CuCu). Rates of deactivation by hydrogen peroxide of the as-isolated hWT and hG93A enzymes were determined and were found to be similar, suggesting that the FALS mutant enzyme is not inactivated at a higher rate than wild type by generation of and subsequent reaction with hydroxyl radical, ⋅OH, when it is in the CuZn form. However, rates of deactivation by hydrogen peroxide of the CuCu derivatives of both hWT and hG93A were significantly greater than those of the copper and zinc containing as-isolated enzymes. Rates of thermal deactivation were also similar for the mutant and hWT as-isolated CuZn forms but were greater for the CuCu derivatives of both enzymes. Reactions of hydrogen peroxide with the Cu(II)Cu(II) derivative of the WT enzyme demonstrate that the copper ion in the copper site is reduced much more rapidly than the copper in the zinc site, leading to the conclusion that reaction of hydrogen peroxide with Cu(I) in the copper site is the source of deactivation in the CuCu as well as the CuZn enzymes.

Rates of deactivation by hydrogen peroxide of the as-isolated hWT and hG93A enzymes were determined and were found to be similar, suggesting that the FALS mutant enzyme is not inactivated at a higher rate than wild type by generation of and subsequent reaction with hydroxyl radical, ⋅OH, when it is in the CuZn form. However, rates of deactivation by hydrogen peroxide of the CuCu derivatives of both hWT and hG93A were significantly greater than those of the copper and zinc containing as-isolated enzymes. Rates of thermal deactivation were also similar for the mutant and hWT as-isolated CuZn forms but were greater for the CuCu derivatives of both enzymes. Reactions of hydrogen peroxide with the Cu(II)Cu(II) derivative of the WT enzyme demonstrate that the copper ion in the copper site is reduced much more rapidly than the copper in the zinc site, leading to the conclusion that reaction of hydrogen peroxide with Cu(I) in the copper site is the source of deactivation in the CuCu as well as the CuZn enzymes. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) familial ALS copper-zinc superoxide dismutase wild type human WT 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide CuCu, and CuZn, remetallated derivatives of CuZn-SOD with copper in the native copper site and the native zinc site either empty (CuE) or containing copper (CuCu) or zinc (CuZn). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease)1 is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. The disease is inherited in ∼10% of cases, and of those cases, ∼20% have been linked to mutations in sod1, the gene that encodes human copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) (1Rosen D.R.

FALS mutations in CuZn-SOD are dominant and are currently believed to exert their effects because of a gain of function rather than a loss of activity. The most convincing evidence for such a gain of toxic function is the observation that expression of FALS mutant human CuZn-SODs in transgenic mice causes motor neuron disease while expression of wild type (WT) human CuZn-SOD does not (2Gurney M.E.

The gain of function hypothesis is also supported by the observation that expression of FALS mutant human CuZn-SODs is proapoptotic in cultured neuronal cells, while WT human CuZn-SOD is antiapoptotic (6Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Borchelt D.R. Gwinn R. Valentine J.S. Sisodia S. Wong P. Lee M. Hahn H. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The expression of the FALS mutant G93A but not WT human CuZn-SOD in a human neuroblastoma cell line induced a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration (7Carri M.T.

CuZn-SOD is a cytosolic antioxidant enzyme that lowers concentrations of superoxide by catalyzing its disproportionation to give hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen. The mechanism involves alternate reduction and reoxidation of the copper ion at the active site of the enzyme (Reactions 1–R3). The rate constants of Reactions 1 and 2 have been measured and are both 2 × 109m−1 s−1and pH-independent over the pH range of 5.0–9.5 (8Bray R.C. Lowe D.J. Capeillère-Blandin C. Fielden E.M.

Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 15Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this peroxidative activity of CuZn-SOD again involves alternate reduction and reoxidation of the copper ion in the enzyme, but this time by hydrogen peroxide (Reactions 4–R7).

In support of this conclusion, CuZn-SOD-catalyzed oxidation of substrates by hydrogen peroxide has been shown to occur in competition with enzyme self-inactivation by hydrogen peroxide (16Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ethanol, formate, and dimethyl sulfoxide are some of the substrates whose oxidation by hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by CuZn-SOD, and, to varying degrees, each of these substrates inhibits the inactivation of the enzyme (17Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 18Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4099-4105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spin trap DMPO (5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide) is another example of a substrate that is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in a reaction catalyzed by CuZn-SOD (Reactions 4, 5, and 8). DMPO-OH, the product that is formed upon reaction of DMPO with hydroxyl radical, is readily detected by EPR spectroscopy. DMPO+(·OH)Cu(II)Zn­SOD→DMPO­OH+Cu(II)Zn­SOD REACTION 8 Solving the plaguing mystery of why CuZn-SOD, a presumably good protein and hero of the cell, has turned into a villain in causing FALS is a major goal of current research on this enzyme. The copper in SOD has been implicated based on the beneficial effects of copper chelators in a neural cell culture model of SOD-associated FALS (6Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Borchelt D.R. Gwinn R. Valentine J.S. Sisodia S. Wong P. Lee M. Hahn H. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and in the FALS SOD-expressing transgenic mice (19Hottinger A.F. Fine E.G. Gurney M.E. Zurn A.D. Aebischer P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1548-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Three hypotheses have been proposed to account for the possible involvement of copper in the gain of function of the FALS mutant human CuZn-SODs: 1) copper ions could be leaching out of the mutant proteins and inducing toxic effects at another site in the cell; 2) copper ions in the mutant enzymes could be catalyzing nitration of tyrosine residues by peroxynitrite (20Beckman J.S. Carson M. Smith C.D. Koppenol W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 584Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 21Beal M.F. Ferrante R.J. Browne S.E. Matthews R.T. Kowall N.W. Brown Jr., R.H. Ann.

A. 1997; 94: 7606-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar); and 3) copper ions in the mutant enzymes could be catalyzing deleterious oxidation reactions of substrates by hydrogen peroxide (17Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar,18Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4099-4105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter hypothesis for the gain of a toxic function resulting from the FALS mutations in CuZn-SOD is that they cause a change in the structure of the enzyme that results in an enhancement of the ability of the enzyme-bound copper ion to catalyze destructive oxidative reactions of substrates with peroxides (Reaction 6). In partial support of the feasibility of this hypothetical mechanism, the FALS mutant human CuZn-SOD enzymes A4V and G93A were shown to have an enhanced ability to catalyze the oxidation of DMPO by hydrogen peroxide to give DMPO-OH (23Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 24Yim M.B. Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8861-8863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Determination of the rate of enzyme inactivation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide is another method that can be used to measure the ability of CuZn-SOD and its mutants to function as catalysts of peroxidation reactions. This approach has the advantage that the protein itself is the substrate for the oxidation reaction, uncomplicated by the question of substrate accessibility to the active site. Thus, the relative rates of inactivation of CuZn-SOD and its mutants by hydrogen peroxide are expected to reflect exactly the relative ability of these enzymes to catalyze peroxidative reactions of hydrogen peroxide. All solutions were prepared using distilled water that had been passed through a Millipore ultrapurification system. EDTA and sodium formate were purchased from Sigma. Solution pH was adjusted by the addition of H2SO4 (double distilled from Vycor, GFC Chem. Co.) and NaOH (Puratronic, Alfa/Ventron Chem.) Monobasic potassium phosphate buffer (Ultrex; J. T. Baker Inc.), adjusted to the proper pH, was used in all activity measurements. Hydrogen peroxide was of the highest purity (The Olin Corporation) and titrated for determination of the concentration using published procedures as well as the absorbance at 230 nm (ε 230 = 61 m−1cm−1) (26McEwen Jr., C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17B: 686-692Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed and purified according to a published procedure (23Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) with the addition of a final purification step on a Pharmacia Resource Q XK26 ion exchange column (26 × 20 cm), equilibrated with 2.5 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The protein was eluted from the column using a salt gradient of the same equilibration buffer containing 160 mm NaCl. Protein samples specified as “as-isolated” were purified but were not subjected to demetallation and remetallation after purification. Demetallation of the as-isolated protein samples to obtain the apoproteins was carried out as described previously (27Valentine J.S. Pantoliano M.W. Spiro T.G. Copper Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 292-358Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of 1.08 × 104m−1cm−1 at 280 nm for the purified enzyme. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to estimate purity. Mass spectrometry was also used to determine purity by measuring the exact molecular weight of the monomer for each of the proteins. In some cases, the measured molecular weight of the isolated protein indicated the presence of an extra cysteine bound to the protein. Treatment of those protein samples with dithiothreitol to remove the excess cysteine produced proteins whose measured molecular weights corresponded to the calculated molecular weight for the mutant and WT proteins, within experimental error. The absence or presence of this cysteine made no difference in the measured overall metal binding ability of the SOD. The protein samples were washed with 3–5 times the total volume of sample, several times, in a Centricon-10 (Amicon) microconcentrator with either pH 7.0 potassium phosphate buffer, for the as-isolated proteins, or pH 5.5 sodium acetate buffer, for the remetallated proteins, in order to remove any excess metal ions that might have been present in the solution and to ensure that the activity of the enzyme originated only from copper ions tightly bound to the protein, i.e. that none of the measured SOD activity was due to free or loosely bound copper ions. Protein concentrations were remeasured after the washing procedure and immediately prior to determination of SOD activities and deactivation measurements. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was carried out using a Pye-Unicam atomic absorption instrument to determine copper and, where applicable, zinc concentrations. Measurements were made in triplicate with an experimental error of <5%. Copper and zinc content was determined for both the as-isolated and the remetallated proteins. Pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out using the 2 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Dosimetry was established using the KSCN dosimeter, assuming that (SCN)2−has a G value of 6.13 and a molar absorptivity of 7950m−1 cm−1 at 472 nm. Irradiation of water by an electron beam generates the primary radicals,⋅OH, eaq− and ⋅H. These radicals are efficiently converted into O2− in the presence of formate and oxygen via the following reactions:⋅OH + HCO2− → CO2− + H2O followed by CO2− + O2 → CO2 + O2− and eaq− + O2 → O2−, H + O2 → HO2, where HO2 → H+ + O2−. The decay of O2− was monitored at 250–270 nm. Determinations of SOD activities were carried out in air-saturated 10 mm formate and 10 mm phosphate aqueous solutions at either pH 5.5 or pH 7.0 at 25 °C, with 30 μm EDTA present to complex any adventitious metal ions that might be present in trace amounts. An observed first order rate for the catalytic dismutation of O2− in the presence of SOD was extracted from the observed change in absorbance (at 260 nm) with respect to time. The reported rate constants for the CuZn-SOD studies were calculated by dividing the observed rates by one-half or one-fourth of the total concentration of copper bound to the enzyme in solution for CuZn-SOD and CuCu-SOD, respectively. This calculation takes into account the fact that the two copper ions that are bound per protein dimer in the CuZn derivative are in the copper sites and both are therefore expected to be catalytically active in the SOD reaction, while only two of the four copper ions per protein dimer in the CuCu derivative are expected to be active since copper in the zinc sites of CuZn-SOD derivatives does not have SOD activity. The amount of bound copper was determined by first measuring the activity of the enzyme at pH 5.5–5.6 both in the presence and absence of EDTA. The amount of free copper in the solution was determined by extrapolating the difference in these observed rates in that pH range from a previously determined pH versus rate constant calibration curve for free copper in the same buffer conditions as used in the experiment. The amount of free copper was then subtracted from the total copper concentration as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy to give the total amount of copper bound to the enzyme and therefore the active enzyme concentration (after the correction described above). The data was an average of five measurements for each sample for every pH data point. Hydrogen peroxide (4.90, 9.80, 19.5, and 39.0 mm final concentrations after mixing) was added to solutions of the proteins (0.4–1.2 μm final concentration) in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were withdrawn at set time points, mixed with 0.5 ml of 20 mm formate and 10 mm phosphate solution, and immediately pulse-irradiated for determination of the SOD activity. The solutions assayed thus remained 10 mm in phosphate, while the concentrations of CuZn-SOD, H2O2, and formate were diluted by a factor of 2 relative to the initial concentrations. It should be noted here that formate, itself an⋅OH radical scavenger, was added after the timed exposure to hydrogen peroxide and immediately prior to pulsing and thus did not interfere with the deactivation reaction. The rate constants for deactivation with hydrogen peroxide were measured under first order conditions with peroxide in large excess over the enzyme. The second order rate constants (k bimolec) were calculated by dividing the first order rate by the peroxide concentrations. Therefore, the absolute concentration of enzyme was not important for the calculation. Thermal inactivation of the proteins was studied at temperatures ranging from 25 to 85 °C in the same buffers used for the hydrogen peroxide inactivation experiments described above. To conserve protein, samples were reused as follows. A sample was heated to the indicated temperature, and the SOD activity was determined. The sample was then heated to a higher temperature, and the SOD activity was determined again. This procedure was repeated until the activity was observed to decrease, at which point a new sample was substituted and heated to the temperature at which the previous sample had lost activity for subsequent activity determinations. The change in activity of the enzyme with temperature was reversible in the range of ∼25–70 °C. At higher temperatures, the deactivation was essentially irreversible. The reduction of CuCu hWT (0.3 mm dimer enzyme) with H2O2 (1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mm final concentrations) was followed by UV-visible light. The hydrogen peroxide was added directly to the protein in the cuvette and then immediately monitored using a Cary3 UV-visible spectrometer (Varian, Sunnyvale, CA). The complete spectra (230–900 nm) were obtained every 3 min for approximately 30 min. The particular wavelength absorbance, corresponding to the Cu(II)d-d transitions in the copper site (∼680 nm) and Cu(II) in the zinc site (∼810 nm) was followed with respect to time. All experiments were carried out in air-saturated solutions. Wild type human CuZn-SOD was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously. Metal analyses of the as-isolated proteins varied according to the exact conditions of the expression, but the zinc-to-copper ratio was consistently high. Proteins that had been properly metallated in vivo would be expected to contain identical amounts of copper and zinc ions, but we found ratios of 2–5 zinc ions per copper. The total metal ion content, i.e.([Cu] + [Zn])/[protein dimer], would normally be expected to be 4.0, but, for both the as-isolated WT and the mutant proteins, it was found to fall in the range 4.4–5.0. The CuCu derivatives, prepared by the addition of four equivalents of Cu(II) to the apoprotein dimer followed by washing with buffer, retained 3.64 equivalents per dimer (91%) of its copper in the case of the WT protein and 2.69 equivalents per dimer (67%) in the case of G93A; they each were found to contain <0.40 equivalents (<10% of the total metal bound to the enzyme) of zinc per dimer. The rate constants as a function of pH for dismutation of superoxide catalyzed by CuZn-SOD derivatives were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” for: 1) as-isolated WT CuZn-SOD, 2) as-isolated G93A CuZn-SOD, 3) remetallated CuCu-WT SOD, and 4) remetallated CuCu G93A. Solutions of the enzyme (0.4–1.2 μm) were pulse-irradiated, and the disappearance of superoxide was monitored at 250–270 nm. The catalytic rate constants of the as-isolated WT CuZn-SOD and as-isolated G93A CuZn-SOD as a function of pH are shown in Fig. 1. (Note the rate constant calculations are based on the concentration of copper-bound enzyme rather than the concentration of the proteins themselves, since only copper-containing enzymes are active.) Both as-isolated WT and G93A CuZn-SOD had relatively high SOD activities (1–2 × 109m−1 s−1) that were pH-independent over the range of pH 5.0–9.5 (see Fig. 1). The remetallated CuCu derivatives of both WT and G93A CuZn-SOD, prepared by the addition of 4.0 equivalents of Cu2+ per apoprotein dimer followed by washing, also gave full SOD activity (Fig. 1). Analogous studies were carried out using remetallated samples of WT and G93A CuZn-SOD that were prepared from the apoprotein by the sequential addition of Zn2+ followed by Cu2+. The SOD activity per protein-bound copper of the remetallated WT CuZn-SOD was identical to that of the as-isolated WT CuZn-SOD. By contrast, the SOD activity of the remetallated G93A CuZn-SOD was much reduced, suggesting improper placement of metal ions in the remetallated mutant protein, 2J. J. Goto, H. Zhu, E. B. Gralla, J. S. Valentine, and D. E. Cabelli, manuscript in preparation. although it was reconstituted by the same method that was successful for remetallation of the WT apoprotein. Therefore we used as-isolated G93A protein for the CuZn derivative in these experiments. The SOD catalytic rate constants are given in Fig. 2, A–D as a function of the time of exposure to hydrogen peroxide at the indicated concentrations. The rate constants for hydrogen peroxide-induced inactivation were identical for the WT CuZn-SOD and as-isolated FALS mutant G93A enzymes (Fig. 2, A and B). The same phenomenon was observed for the remetallated CuCu derivatives of WT CuZn-SOD and G93A,i.e. the rates of loss of activity in the presence of hydrogen peroxide were identical for the FALS mutant and the WT enzymes (Fig. 2, C and D). However, comparison of the rates for the as-isolated derivatives that contain both Cu2+ and Zn2+ with those that contain only Cu2+ reveals that the rate of deactivation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide is significantly enhanced when copper ions are bound to the zinc site as well as to the copper site for either the WT or FALS mutant enzymes (Fig. 2, compare A with Cand B with D). Plots of the log of the observed first order rate constants for catalytic dismutation of superoxide by the enzyme versusperoxide concentrations were linear, indicating that the deactivation reaction was first order in hydrogen peroxide concentration. A regression line was fitted to the data (r 2 = 0.95–0.99), and the half-life (t 1/2) for deactivation was extracted. The rate constants for deactivation were calculated from the half-lives using the following relationship:k obs(s−1) = 0.693/t1/2 and are given in Table I. The bimolecular rate constant was calculated by dividing the first order rate by the peroxide concentration:k bimolec(m−1s−1) =k obs/[H2O2]. If all of the first order rate constants are essentially identical, then the simple reaction mechanism given above (Reactions 4, 5, and 7) is a reasonable description. However, the results are such as to give a hint that at high peroxide concentration, saturation may be occurring, possibly by the mechanism shown in Reaction 9. This result is not unprecedented; previous work by others in the field showed similar indications (24Yim M.B. Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab Conditions were as follows: 10 mm formate, 10 mm phosphate, 30 μm EDTA, O2-saturated, pH 7.0. The loss of SOD activity upon heating the as-isolated WT and G93A and the remetallated CuCu derivatives was also investigated. Once again, the as-isolated WT and the FALS mutant behave similarly to each other, as did the remetallated CuCu derivatives of those same proteins, but both of the remetallated CuCu derivatives were inactivated at a lower temperature (∼65–75 °C) than both of the as-isolated copper- and zinc-containing proteins (∼75–85 °C) (Fig. 3). Preferential reduction of Cu(II) in the copper site of CuCu WT had been observed previously for the CuCu derivative of bovine CuZn-SOD (14Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 29Symonyan M.A. Nalbandyan R.M. FEBS Lett. 1972; 28: 22-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and similar behavior was expected for the human WT enzyme and was in fact observed. Accordingly, the rate of reduction for Cu(II) in the copper site was found to be significantly faster than for the Cu(II) in the zinc site (data not shown). The evidence obtained thus far indicates that FALS mutant CuZn-SOD enzymes have acquired an as yet unidentified property that is deleterious to motor neurons. One hypothesis as to the identity of this property is that mutant enzymes catalyze deleterious oxidation reactions, enhancing production of ⋅OH radicals from hydrogen peroxide. In support of this hypothesis, EPR spin trapping experiments demonstrated an enhanced production of DMPO-OH from the reaction between the enzyme and H2O2. However, our current studies show that there is no difference in the rates of deactivation between the WT and mutant enzyme. Others have recently reached this same conclusion (30Liochev S.I. Chen L.L. Hallewell R.A. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Liochev S.I. Chen L.L. Hallewell R.A. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Singh R.J. Karoui H. Gunther M.R. Beckman J.S. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6675-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A careful understanding of the experiments is critical to understanding the meaning of the results for both the spin-trapping and pulse radiolysis experiments. The difference between the two experimental systems is that the spin trapping experiment uses an exogenous free radical scavenger, while the inactivation experiment uses the active site itself as the scavenger. It is important to note that the increase in the EPR spin trap signal does not necessarily indicate an increase in the rate constant for⋅OH radical production (k 5) but may represent increased substrate (DMPO, formate, glutamate, ethanol, etc.) accessibility to the active site in the mutant enzymes. The increased accessibility may result from the mutant having a more flexible and thereby open active site channel as compared with hWT. The substrate accessibility factor is eliminated in our pulse radiolysis studies where there is no exogenous substrate; the substrate is the enzyme itself. The idea that the FALS mutant CuZn-SOD enzymes may have more accessible active sites is supported by recent crystallographic studies of the G37R mutant, which indicate that the active site of this mutant is more open than that of the WT enzyme (33Hart P.J. Liu H. Pellegrini M. Nersissian A.M. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The reason for the increase in deactivation rate constants for CuCu-SOD relative to CuZn-SOD is as yet unknown. We can assume that the effect is due to changes in the reactivity of copper at the copper site, since the copper(II) in the zinc site of WT CuCu-SOD does not react rapidly enough with hydrogen peroxide to be the source of the enhanced peroxidative activity. Presumably, the enhanced reactivity with hydrogen peroxide is related to whatever causes the increased susceptibility of the human WT and G93A enzymes to thermal inactivation when they are in the CuCu rather than the CuZn form. The latter result suggests that Cu(II) in the zinc site may cause a global increase in the flexibility of both the WT and mutant enzymes. Whatever the cause, the increase in deactivation rates for the CuCu-SOD derivatives relative to the CuZn-SOD form for the WT enzyme suggests an interesting additional possibility for enhancement of ⋅OH radical generation from the FALS mutant enzymes, i.e. that the copper and zinc sites of the mutant enzymes may have lost their ability to discriminate between these two metal ions and thus may bind some copper ions in the zinc site. Such aberrant copper ion binding in the zinc site would accelerate the rate constant for ⋅OH radical generation from reactions of hydrogen peroxide with copper in the copper site of the mutant enzymes (Reaction 5). The possibility of a subpopulation of mutant protein with some Cu(II) in the zinc site as well as in the copper site could thus provide an additional or alternative explanation of the EPR spin-trapping results. Isolated wild type human CuZn-SOD has usually been found to contain copper and zinc in nearly equal amounts. Extensive structural and spectroscopic studies have led to the conclusion that copper is bound predominantly to the copper site and zinc to the zinc site in the wild type, but the mechanism of metal ion insertion and the basis for the high degree of selectivity of each site for its respective metal ion is not well understood. Studies of metal-substituted derivatives of CuZn-SOD have demonstrated that a variety of different metal ions can be bound in place of the native metal ions at either or both of the metal binding sites, but only copper ions in the copper site give high SOD activity. For example, the four-copper derivative of the bovine WT enzyme, CuCu-SOD was found to have the same SOD activity as CuZn-SOD (34Fee J.A. Briggs R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 400: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), despite having twice as much enzyme-bound copper, and AgCu-SOD, with copper only in the zinc site, was found to be inactive (35Beem K.M. Richardson D.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1930-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Loss of specificity for metal binding in the FALS mutant CuZn-SOD enzymes is not unprecedented. Our initial studies on the yeast analogues of the FALS mutants showed aberrant metal binding (36Nishida C.R. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Further characterization of one of the yeast analogues and several human analogues clearly showed the loss of the ability of the zinc site to bind Co(II) as a substitute for the spectroscopically silent Zn(II) (37Lyons T.J. Liu H. Goto J.J. Nersissian A. Roe J.A. Graden J.A. Café C. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12240-12244Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, both the wild type and the FALS human mutant G93A CuZn-SOD, as isolated from a yeast expression system, contained abnormally high levels of zinc and low levels of copper. Despite the fact that the as-isolated wild type and G93A CuZn-SOD contained abnormally low copper, the copper that was bound to the enzyme had high SOD activity, and we therefore conclude that all or nearly all of the copper in as-isolated WT and G93A CuZn-SOD was in the copper site. These are human enzymes expressed in yeast, so a possible explanation for these unusual results is that the putative copper chaperone in yeast, LYS7 (38Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 39Corson L.B. Strain J.J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), cannot fully substitute for the analogous human copper chaperone, CCS, in loading the copper and zinc ion efficiently and properly into the human SOD protein. Removal of the metal ions from the as-isolated enzymes to obtain apoprotein followed by remetallation with 4 equivalents of copper per dimer gave fully loaded enzyme with full SOD activity for the G93A mutant as well as WT. This result indicates that the mutant is capable of binding copper ions to both the copper and the zinc sites and that derivatives with copper ions in both sites are fully active. A significant difference was observed upon remetallation with copper and zinc. The WT SOD apoprotein was remetallated efficiently, and Cu(II) and Zn(II) metal ions were inserted cleanly into their proper sites, as judged from the spectroscopic properties of the remetallated protein and its high SOD activity. However, remetallation of the mutant apoenzyme under the same conditions produced enzyme with the proper amounts of metal ions bound but with unusual spectroscopic characteristics and dramatically lower SOD activity, indicating that, unlike the WT human apoenzyme, the mutant human enzyme, in the absence of the proper human copper chaperone system CCS, was no longer able to discriminate properly between zinc and copper when confronted with the free metal ion in solution. Thus, the FALS mutant human G93A apo-SOD, when reconstituted with copper and zinc in vitro in the absence of a copper chaperone, appeared to bind much of the copper ion in the zinc site, where it was SOD-inactive. Thus, the copper site could be fully loaded with copper to give full SOD activity only when copper ions were used to fill the zinc sites as well. Oxidative damage occurring as a result of the peroxidative activity of FALS mutant CuZn-SOD can thus be hypothesized to arise from either or both of these two mechanisms: 1) increased access of a substrate to the active site, leading to increased oxidation of a substrate (Reaction 6) and 2) increased formation of ⋅OH radical (Reaction 5) due to the presence of copper rather than zinc in the zinc site leading to a subpopulation of CuCu-SOD that is more reactive. An intriguing third possibility is that increased production of ⋅OH radical could lead to damaged inactive mutant SOD enzymes that could slowly release free copper ions that could catalyze deleterious Fenton-type oxidation reactions at or near the sites where they are released. It should nevertheless be noted that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide used in these experiments is undoubtedly greater than that normally encountered by the mutant enzymes in vivo and that the significance of this type of peroxidative reactivity in ALS is therefore difficult to judge, especially in the absence of any knowledge of the nature of potential targets of oxidative damage in or near the motor neuron. Future experiments are planned to test the ability of a variety of hydroxyl radical scavengers to slow the inactivation of the WT and mutant enzymes in their CuCu and CuZn forms by reaction with hydrogen peroxide. A preferential reduction in deactivation would indicate an increased effectiveness in scavenging by a particular exogenous scavenger and could provide a measure of increased access to the active sites or increased overall flexibility of particular forms of the enzymes. We are also investigating further the alterations in the abilities of the metal sites of the mutant enzymes to discriminate between copper and zinc ions in binding to the individual metal binding sites in an effort to judge if they are related to the disease-causing properties of these mutant enzymes."

At this stage, there were still a number of protein bands on SDS gels, but only the 61-kDa band became specifically labeled with the photoaffinity substrate, azido-GDP-l-[32P]fucose. Several peptides from this 61-kDa band were sequenced and these sequences were used for cloning the gene. The cDNA clone yielded high levels of GFPP activity when expressed in myeloma cells and in a baculovirus system, demonstrating that the 61-kDa band is the authentic GFPP.

GDP-β-l-fucose pyrophosphorylase polymerase chain reaction high performance liquid chromatography expressed sequence tag. l-Fucose (6-deoxy-l-galactose) is an important sugar in complex carbohydrates and is frequently found at the non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide chains (1Munro J.R. Narasimhan S. Wetmore S. Riordan J.R. Schachter H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Frequently,l-fucose mediates the recognition reactions that are typical of various glycoproteins and glycolipids (2Fukuda M. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1994: 1-52Google Scholar, 3Walz G. Aruffo A. Kolanus W. Bevilacgua M. Seed B. Science. 1990; 250: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Thus, oligosaccharides with α1,2-linked fucose are precursors for the blood group A and B substances (4Ernst L.K. Rajan V.P. Larsen R.D. Ruff M.M. Lower J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3436-3447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the Lewis type of blood group antigens, Galβ1,3(Fucα1,4)GlcNAc-R and Fucα1,2Galβ1,3(Fucα1,4)GlcNAc-R, are the determinants for Lewisa and Lewisb (5Amano J. Straehl P. Berger E.G. Kochibe N.

Another fucosylated oligosaccharide, i.e. Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAc-R, is called the Lewisx antigen, and has been shown to be a stage-specific embryonic antigen during development in the mouse (7Fenderson B.A. Zehavi U. Hakomori S. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This oligosaccharide may also be involved in cell-cell interactions during embryogenesis (8Hyafil E. Babinet C. Jacob F. Cell. 1981; 26: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 9Gooi H.C. Feizi T. Kapadia A. Knowles B.B. Solter D. Evans M.J. Nature. 1981; 292: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Fucosylated oligosaccharides with sialic acid on one terminus have recently been demonstrated to be ligands for several members of the selectin family of membrane receptors. In particular, NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAc-R, the sialyl Lewisxantigen, is the ligand for the E and P selectins (10Vries T. Eijnden D.H. Shultz J. O'Neill R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Phillips M.L. Nudelman E. Gaeta F.C.A. Perez M. Singhal A.K. Hakomori S. Paulson J.C.

In addition, an isomer of the sialyl Lewisx, called sialyl Lewisa and having the structure NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3(Fucα1,4)GlcNAc-R, is also a ligand for the E selectin (14Berg E.L. Magnani J. Warnock R.A.

Watson S.R. Dowbenko D. Fennie C. Lasky L.A. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Asa D. Brandley B.K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Specific studies on structure-function of these ligands have suggested that subtle differences in the structures of the sialyated, fucosylated oligosaccharides affect the binding affinities of the selectins for these molecules (17Green P.I. Tamatani T. Watanabe T. Miyasaka M. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Yuen C-T. Stoll M.S. Feizi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. Nature. 1984; 361: 555-557Google Scholar). The fucosyl donor for these fucosylated oligosaccharides is GDP-β-L-fucose. The major pathway for formation of GDP-fucose involves the oxidation-reduction and epimerization of GDP-α-d-mannose to produce GDP-β-l-fucose (19Bulet P. Hoflack B. Porchet M. Verbert A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This pathway is present in most animal cells and tissues, as well as in plants and microorganisms. An alternate pathway of formation of GDP-β-l-fucose is present in certain mammalian tissues, such as liver and kidney, and apparently functions as a salvage pathway to reutilize l-fucose arising from the turnover of glycoproteins and glycolipids (21Coffey J.W. Miller O.N. Sellinger O.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway involves the phosphorylation of l-fucose by a specific kinase to form β-l-fucose-1-P (22Butler W. Serif G.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1975; 69: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have purified the GDP-β-l-fucose pyrophosphorylase from porcine kidney, and identified the specific GFPP1 protein band using the photoprobe N3-GDP-β-l-[32P]fucose. Several peptide sequences from this protein were used to clone the encoding cDNA which gave high amounts of GFPP activity when expressed in a myeloma cell line. In addition, various properties of the enzyme, purified from kidney or obtained from the myeloma cells, have been determined and are described in this manuscript. l-[3H]Fucose-1-P was prepared froml-[5,6-3H]fucose (40–60 Ci/mmol) using the purified pig kidney l-fucokinase (25Park S.H. Pastuszak I. Drake R. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5685-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled fucose, as well as GDP-β-l-[1-3H]fucose (5–15 Ci/mmol), were purchased from NEN Life Science Products Inc. Unlabeled sugars, sugar phosphates, and nucleoside diphosphate sugars were obtained from Sigma. Various absorbents were obtained from the following sources: DEAE-cellulose (DE-52) from Whatman Chemical Separations, Inc. and Polybuffer Exchanger 94, Polybuffer 74, red-Sepharose, and phenyl-Sepharose were purchased from Sigma. Polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates, cellulose TLC plates, and silica gel TLC plates were purchased from EM Science Inc. The following materials were obtained from Bio-Rad: SDS, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, hydroxylapatite, Coomassie Blue, and protein assay reagent. All other chemicals were from reliable chemical sources, and were of the best grade available. The pyrophosphorylase could be assayed in the forward (i.e. formation of GDP-fucose from fucose-1-P and GTP), or in the reverse (i.e. formation of fucose-1-P and GTP from GDP-fucose and inorganic pyrophosphate) directions, as indicated below. For measuring the activity in the forward direction, the incubation mixtures contained the following components in a final volume of 50 μl: 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 8 mmMgCl2, 100 μml-[3H]fucose-1-P (40,000 cpm), 5 mm GTP, 0.5 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and different amounts of the GFPP at various stages of purification. After an incubation at 37 oC for 5 or 10 min, the reaction was terminated by heating the tubes in a boiling water bath for 40 s. The reaction mixture was then applied to a column of DE-52 (about 1 ml of resin in a Pasteur pipette), and the columns were washed with 50 mm (NH4)HCO3 to remove sugar phosphates, and then with 200 mm(NH4)HCO3 to elute the GDP-fucose. The radioactivity in the various fractions was determined as a measure of the amount of GDP-fucose formed. The amount of product could also be determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity that bound to DE-52 after treatment of the reaction mixture with 2 units of alkaline phosphatase for 20 min at 37 oC. Alkaline phosphatase removes the phosphate group from any remaining sugar phosphate but does not affect the nucleoside diphosphate sugar that is produced in the reaction. After treatment with phosphatase, the reaction mixtures were placed on DE-52 and the columns were washed with 10 mm(NH4)HCO3. The GDP-fucose was eluted from the columns as described above and the radioactivity in the eluate was determined. In most of the experiments described in this study, pyrophosphorylase activity was determined by measuring the formation of GDP-l-fucose (forward assay), since this assay was considered to be more reliable. The enzyme activity, especially with more purified enzyme fractions, could also be determined by measuring the formation of fucose-1-P from GDP-fucose (reverse reaction). For measuring activity in the reverse direction, the incubation mixtures contained the following components in a final volume of 50 μl: 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 8 mmMgCl2, 100 μm GDP-[3H]fucose (10,000–15,000 cpm), and various amounts of the GFPP at different stages of purification. Incubations were done at 37 oC for 5 min, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The nucleotides were then absorbed on to activated charcoal (150 mg/ml of Darco G-50 in water). The suspension was vortexed vigorously, centrifuged, and the supernatant liquid was removed and saved. The charcoal pellet was washed with 1 ml of water and again centrifuged. The supernatant liquid from this wash was pooled with the first supernatant liquid, and an aliquot of the pooled fraction was counted for the determination of radioactivity converted to [3H]fucose-1-P. Pig kidneys were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and were kept on ice until used. The kidneys were cut into small pieces and homogenized in Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sucrose, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in a Waring blender for 3 to 4 min, at high speed. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant liquid was removed and filtered through several layers of cheesecloth, and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 45 min. The supernatant liquid was removed and used as the crude extract. The various steps used in the purification of the enzyme were as follows. Solid polyethylene glycol (8,000 molecular weight) was added to the crude extract to reach a concentration of 30%. The solution was centrifuged and the supernatant liquid was discarded. The precipitate was dissolved in a minimal volume of Buffer A. The enzyme from step 1 was applied to a 5 × 18-cm column of DE-52 that had been equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was then washed with Buffer A to remove unbound protein, and the pyrophosphorylase was eluted with 1 liter of a linear gradient of 0 to 250 mm NaCl. Eight-ml fractions were collected and the enzyme emerged between 75 and 150 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and utilized in further purification steps. The active fractions from the DE-52 column were pooled and brought to 60% saturation by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and dissolved in Buffer A containing 1m ammonium sulfate. This enzyme preparation was applied to a column of phenyl-Sepharose that had been equilibrated with Buffer A, containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. The column was eluted with a downward linear gradient of ammonium sulfate, going from 1m to 0 m salt concentration. The pyrophosphorylase activity began to emerge from the column at about 0.3m ammonium sulfate with the peak of activity eluting at 0.1m salt. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 50 mmsucrose). The dialyzed enzyme from the phenyl-Sepharose column was loaded onto a column of hydroxylapatite (2 × 10 cm), that had been equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with Buffer B to remove unadsorbed protein, and the enzyme was then eluted with a 10–200 mmlinear gradient of phosphate buffer. Fractions containing active enzyme were pooled and concentrated to about 2 ml on the Amicon concentrator, using a PM30 membrane. The concentrated enzyme from the hydroxylapatite column was applied to a column of Sephacryl S-300 that had been equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 50 mm sucrose (Buffer C). The enzyme emerged from the column in the area suggesting a molecular mass of about 60 kDa. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to about 5 ml on an Amicon filtration apparatus, and used in the next step. The concentrated fraction from the Sephacryl column was applied to a column (2 × 10 cm) of Reactive Red-Agarose (Type 3000) that had been equilibrated with Buffer C. The column was washed with the above buffer, and the pyrophosphorylase was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate in Buffer C. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to about 5 ml, and dialyzed against Buffer D (25 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm sucrose). The enzyme from the previous step was applied to a 0.9 × 14-cm column of Polybuffer exchanger (PBE 94) that had been equilibrated with Buffer D. The enzyme was eluted from the column with Polybuffer 74-HCl, pH 4.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm sucrose. Fractions of 2 ml were collected, and each fraction was analyzed for protein, for enzymatic activity, and for pH. The enzyme emerged from the column at pH 6.5 to 5.5, with the peak of activity emerging at pH 6.1 to 5.9. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight against Buffer C, and concentrated. A summary of the purification procedure is outlined in Table I, and the discussion of this procedure is presented under “Results.”Table IPurification of pig kidney GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylasePurification stepsProteinActivity units1-aUnits are expressed as nanomole of product formed per minute.Specific activityPurificationYieldmgunits/mg-fold%1.

Open table in a new tab Human prostate (CLONTECH, HL1140y), and testis (Life Technologies, Inc., 10426-013) cDNA libraries, and human prostate Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH, 7418-1) were purchased. The Epstein-Barr virus transformed B lymphocyte line JY (27Fingeroth J.D. Weis J.J. Tedder T.F. Strominger J.L. Biro P.A. Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4510-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) was used to construct a cDNA library in BluescriptII (Stratagene) according to standard protocols (28Krieger M. Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1990: 11-132Google Scholar). A PCR procedure was used to isolate GFPP clones from prostate, testis, and B cell cDNA libraries. Purified plasmid DNA prepared from the total cDNA library or Marathon-Ready cDNA was amplified with an amplifier set containing a GFPP primer and a vector primer. The PCR primer set F12805+146: CAGAGCTCGGCTTACAGTCC (nucleotides 1139–1159) with a vector-specific primer was used to amplify the 3′ end of the GFPP from all of the cDNA sources. The 5′ end of GFPP was isolated with the PCR primer set F12805−283: AATGCAGTTTTCCCCAACTG (nucleotides 1314–1295) and a vector primer. PCR products amplified with Taq polymerase were cloned into pCRII and Pfu polymerase-amplified products were cloned into pCR-blunt (Invitrogen). Both strands of at least two clones from each cDNA source were sequenced. The primer FP-29, TCGCAGCGATACTTCCGGAG, was used with the human Promoter Finder Walking kit (CLONTECH, K1803-1) to isolate sequences upstream of the GFPP coding region. Sequencing was performed on an ABI model 373 automated sequencer in the Core Facilities at San Diego State University. A probe encompassing nucleotides 170–1314 of the GFPP cDNA was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP, using a random priming kit (Boehringer Mannheim). A human multiple tissue Northern blotII (CLONTECH 7759-1) containing poly(A) mRNA from spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes was hybridized and washed at high stringency according to the manufacturer's protocol. The murine myeloma cell line, NSO (Celltech), does not grow in glutamine-free selection medium. NSO cells were maintained in non-selective media: Iscove's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Selective media consisted of Iscove's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 × GS supplement (JRH Bioscience). Amplification media was prepared using Iscove's modified Eagle's medium selective media, supplemented with l-methionine sulfoximine (MSX, Sigma) at concentrations of 20–40 μm. The vector pEE12 was obtained from Celltech. This plasmid contains a glutamine synthetase gene under control of SV40 early promoter. Downstream of the SV40-GS transcription unit is the human cytomegalovirus enhancer, promoter and 5′-untranslated region from the major immediate early gene. The multicloning site is located directly downstream of this sequence. The plasmid also contains ampicillin resistance genes for maintenance in bacteria. A 1.8-kilobase EcoRV fragment containing the entire open reading frame of GFPP was inserted into the SmaI restriction site of the plasmid pEE12 generating the plasmid pEE12-GFPP using general molecular biology techniques (28Krieger M. Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1990: 11-132Google Scholar). The orientation of the clone was judged to be correct by restriction mapping. pEE12-GFPP was linearized with SalI, precipitated, and resuspended in sterile TE at 1 μg/ml. NSO cells were grown to a density of 8 × 105 cells/ml and 107 cells were pelleted and washed once with cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and then pelleted again. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and stored on ice for up to 1 h prior to electroporation. Linearized pEE12-GFPP DNA (40 μg) and 0.8 ml of the NSO cell suspension were transferred to an electroporation cuvette and incubated on ice for 5 min. A “gene pulser” electroporation (Bio-Rad) delivered 1500 volts, 3 microfarads to the DNA/cell suspension, and the cuvette was incubated on ice for 5 min. The DNA/cell suspension was diluted in non-selective media to prepare cell suspensions ranging in density from 2.67 × 105 to 1.33 × 104 cells/ml. Cell suspensions were plated at 50 μl/well in a 96-well flat bottomed plate and incubated at 37 oC. After 24 h, 150 ml of selective media were added and the plates were incubated until substantial cell death had occurred and discrete colonies were apparent. Resistant colonies were transferred to 24-well plates and assayed for GFPP activity. Positive colonies were then gradually expanded. The GFPP coding region was amplified from a cDNA library made from the B lymphocyte cell line JY. Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used with the primer sets TCAGATATCGGGGCTATGGCAGCTGCTAG and TTTGATATCTCTCTACATCAAACTGCTTTTTAAAC and the product cloned into pCR-blunt (Invitrogen). The GFPP clone was verified by sequencing both strands. The insert was cut out with EcoR5 and transferred to the SmaI site of pVL1392 (Invitrogen). A clone containing GFPP in the correct orientation was identified by restriction mapping. Recombinant baculovirus was generated with this clone following the manufacturer's protocol, and tested for activity (Invitrogen). To quantitatively determine the expression of GFPP cDNA from whole cell lysates, a reverse phase ion pairing HPLC method was developed that resolved GDP-fucose from GDP-mannose as well as GTP, GDP, GMP, and guanosine. An Alltech Adsorbosphere HS C18 150 × 4.6-mm column (Alltech 28773) with a 7-μm particle size was utilized for these assays. The elution buffers providing the best resolution were 20 mm potassium phosphate (monobasic), 10 mm tetrapropylammonium phosphate, pH 5.0, with H3PO4 (Buffer A) and methanol (Buffer B), using a linear gradient of Buffer B from 1 to 20% over 20 min. NSO cells expressing recombinant GFPP were lysed with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100. Ten μl of this extract were assayed in a 20-μl assay mixture consisting of 50 mmTris buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm [3H]GTP, 10 mml-fucose-1-P, and 10 milliunits of inorganic pyrophosphatase with an incubation of 5 min at 37 oC. Assays were quenched with methanol, and protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant liquid was removed and dried under a vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 20 μl for analysis by HPLC. The formation of GDP-fucose was quantitated by measuring its absorbance at 260 nm and by scintillation counting of 250-μl aliquots across the elution gradient. The assay was linear with time and protein concentration. Negative controls included NSO cells harboring an irrevelant construct (β1,4-galactosyl transferase), or assay mixtures in which fucose-1-P was omitted. The reaction products, formed in either the forward direction (i.e. GDP-β-l-fucose) or the reverse direction (i.e. GTP and l-fucose-1-P), were isolated by chromatography on a 1 × 10-cm column of DEAE-cellulose (HCO3− form), equilibrated with H2O. After applying the sample, the column was washed with H2O, and retained materials were eluted with 100 ml of a linear gradient of 0 to 150 mm(NH4)HCO3. Fractions were analyzed for nucleotides by measuring the absorption at 260 nm, for radioactivity by scintillation counting, and for 6-deoxyhexose by the cysteine-sulfuric reaction (29Ashwell G. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 73-105Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and (NH4)HCO3 was removed by evaporation in the presence of triethylamine. The triethylamine was then removed by evaporation in the presence of methanol. The reaction products were identified by chromatography either directly or following various treatments such as digestion with phosphodiesterase or alkaline phosphatase, or by acid hydrolysis. Nucleotides were identified by TLC in the following systems: polyethyleneimine plates developed in 0.2 and 0.4 msolutions of LiCl; cellulose plates in ethanol, 1 mammonium acetate, pH 7.5 (7:3); or silica gel plates in ethanol, 1m ammonium acetate, pH 5.0 (7:3). l-Fucose was released from the nucleotide by mild acid hydrolysis (0.02n HCl, 100 oC, 15 min) and identified by chromatography on Whatman 3MM paper in 1-butanol/pyridine/water (6:4:3). Sugars were detected with the silver nitrate reagent (30Trevelyan W.E. Proctor D.P. Harrison J.S. Nature. 1950; 166: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar). Native PAGE was performed as described by Davis (31Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15912) Google Scholar) with an 8% gel and a discontinuous buffer system, under nondenaturing conditions. Two samples were run in parallel, one lane was stained with Coomassie Blue to detect protein bands; the other lane was cut into 0.5-cm pieces and each piece was crushed in 200 μl of Buffer A and incubated overnight in the cold to elute the enzyme. The supernatant liquid was then assayed for enzymatic activity. SDS-PAGE was done as described previously (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples were mixed with sample buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) and heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The purified enzyme was photolabeled with 8-azido-GDP-l-[α-32P]fucose in the absence or presence of unlabeled GDP-fucose. In these experiments, various amounts of the azido-GDP-[32P]fucose were incubated with the enzyme on ice for 2 min, and then the mixtures were exposed to UV light for 90 s to activate the azido group. The protein was then precipitated by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid and the precipitate was suspended in SDS-loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography for 2–5 days. In some of these incubations, various amounts of unlabeled GDP-fucose were added to determine the specificity of the labeling procedure (33Drake R. Elbein A.D. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The 8-azido-GDPβ-l-[32P]fucose was prepared as follows: GTP (0.5 μmol containing 1 mCi of [α-32P]GTP) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 4 mm MgCl2, 2 μmol of l-fucose-1-P, 2 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and various amounts of the purified GFPP. Incubations were at 37 oC for 1 h after which time 1 ml of methanol was added to terminate the reaction and precipitate the protein. The nucleoside diphosphate sugars were isolated and purified by ion exchange chromatography on DE-52, followed by thin layer chromatography. The addition of the azido group to GDP-fucose was done in a two-step chemical procedure as follows. To a solution of the [α-32P]GDP-fucose in Tris buffer, pH 8.0, water-saturated bromine was added dropwise with stirring to form [α-32P]8-bromo-GDP-fucose. The progress of the reaction was followed by monitoring the shift in the UV spectrum from 252 to 262 nm. The reaction mixture was then diluted with 100 ml of 10 mm (NH4)HCO3 and placed on a column of DE-52 equilibrated with 10 mm(NH4)HCO3. The column was washed with 10 mm (NH4)HCO3 and the 8-bromo-GDP-fucose was eluted with a gradient of 10 to 400 mm (NH4)HCO3. Radiolabeled fractions with absorbance at 262 nm were pooled and concentrated to dryness"
https://openalex.org/W2080124939,Infrared imaging observations have detected a dozen faint young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Taurus and Chamaeleon molecular clouds whose near-infrared colors are similar to those of classical T Tauri stars (TTS). They are around four magnitudes fainter than low-luminosity YSOs in Taurus detected in earlier surveys and as much as eight magnitudes fainter than typical TTS. The extreme faintness of the objects and their lower luminosity relative to previously identified brown dwarfs in the Pleiades indicate that these faint YSOs are very young brown dwarfs on the order of 1 million years old.
https://openalex.org/W2089072197,"Doc2 has one Munc13-interacting domain at the N-terminal region and two C2-like domains interacting with Ca2+ and phospholipid at the C-terminal region. Doc2 consists of two isoforms, Doc2α and -β. Doc2α is specifically expressed in neuronal cells and implicated in Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release, whereas Doc2β is ubiquitously expressed and its function is unknown. We show here that both Doc2α and -β interact with rat tctex-1, a light chain of cytoplasmic dynein, in both cell-free and intact cell systems. Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Doc2 containing the tctex-1-interacting domain induces changes in the intracellular localization of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and its ligand, cathepsin D, which are transported from trans-Golgi network to late endosomes. Overexpression of the C-terminal fragment containing two C2-like domains shows the similar effect, but to a lesser extent, whereas overexpression of full-length Doc2 or the C-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 containing two C2-like domains does not show this effect. Because dynein is a minus-end-directed microtubule-based motor protein, these results suggest that Doc2, especially Doc2β, plays a role in dynein-dependent intracellular vesicle transport.

To clarify the function of Doc2, particularly that of Doc2β, it is important to isolate a Doc2-interacting protein(s) that is ubiquitously expressed. We have attempted here to isolate a Doc2-interacting protein(s) from a rat brain cDNA library by use of the yeast two-hybrid system and identified it to be tctex-1. tctex-1 interacted with both Doc2α and -β at the N-terminal region. tctex-1 was originally isolated as a candidate for involvement in the transmission ratio distortion of mouset-haplotypes (10Lader E.

We describe here the Doc2-tctex-1-interaction and discuss the function of this interaction.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe first attempted to isolate a Doc2-interacting protein which is ubiquitously expressed by use of the yeast two-hybrid system with the N-terminal region (1–90 aa) of Doc2α as a bait from a rat brain cDNA library. Screening of 1 × 106 transformants yielded nine independent positive clones that interacted with Doc2α. The seven positive clones encoded Munc13–1 as described (6Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The remaining two positive clones had the same cDNA inserts with 0.75 and 0.73 kb, respectively. Using the cDNA with 0.75 kb as a probe, we isolated the cDNA encoding the whole open reading frame from a rat brain cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA revealed that the encoded protein consisted of 113 aa and showed a calculated M r of 12,438 (GenBankTM accession number AB010119) (Fig. 1 A). The deduced aa sequence of this molecule had 96% identity with mouse tctex-1 (GenBankTM accession number M25825) (10Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell. 1989; 58: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and 52% identity with human RP-3 (GenBankTM accession number U02556) (16Roux A.F. Rommens J. McDowell C. Anson-Cartwright L. Bell S. Schappert K. Fishman G.A. Musarella M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). RP-3 was isolated as a candidate gene of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa type 3 (16Roux A.F. Rommens J. McDowell C. Anson-Cartwright L. Bell S. Schappert K. Fishman G.A. Musarella M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that the cloned cDNA is rat tctex-1 cDNA. The rat tctex-1 mRNA level was examined in various rat tissues by Northern blot analysis. The tctex-1 mRNA appeared as a single band of approximately 0.8 kb and was ubiquitously expressed, although it was abundantly expressed in testis (data not shown). These results suggest that tctex-1 is a Doc2-interacting protein that is ubiquitously expressed.The minimum region of Doc2α required for the interaction with tctex-1 was 1–32 aa of Doc2α (Fig. 2 A, a). Doc2β also interacted with tctex-1 (Fig. 2 A, b). The tctex-1-interacting region of Doc2α showed striking sequence homology to that of Doc2β (85% identity). Although RP-3 showed sequence homology to tctex-1, RP-3 did not interact with Doc2α or -β (Fig. 2 A, b). These results suggest that the Doc2-tctex-1 interaction is specific.Figure 2Doc2-tctex-1 interaction. A, Doc2-tctex-1 interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system.

In vitro translated RP-3 did not bind to the GST-tagged N-terminal region of Doc2α. The Doc2-tctex-1 interaction was furthermore confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from cultured HeLa cells of Flag-tagged full-length tctex-1 and HA-tagged full-length Doc2α (Fig. 2 C). Flag-tagged full-length RP-3 was not co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged full-length Doc2α (data not shown). These results indicate that tctex-1 interacts with Doc2 in both cell-free and intact cell systems.It has been shown that dynein is involved in the vesicle transport from early to late endosomes (24Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). CIMPR and its ligand, cathepsin D, are transported from trans-Golgi network to early endosomes and then from early to late endosomes in BHK cells (25Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We finally examined whether the Doc2-tctex-1 interaction is involved in this dynein-dependent vesicle transport. When the intracellular localization of CIMPR in BHK cells was analyzed by immunocytochemistry using the anti-CIMPR antibody, CIMPR was distributed in a compact juxtanuclear region corresponding to late endosomes (Fig. 3 A). Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Doc2α containing the tctex-1-binding region induced the dispersion of CIMPR. The severity of this change varied somewhat among transfected cells, usually as a result of variation in expression levels of Doc2α. Overexpression of the C-terminal fragment containing C2-like domains showed the similar effect, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, overexpression of full-length Doc2α did not affect the intracellular localization of CIMPR (data not shown). To determine the specificity of the effect of the Doc2 mutants, we used the similar mutants of rabphilin3, which is a downstream target of the Rab3 small G protein subfamily implicated in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis and has two C2-like domains (26Shirataki H.

Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 containing Rab3-binding domain, its C-terminal fragment containing C2-like domains (data not shown) (27Yamaguchi T. Shirataki H. Kishida S.

As to the effect of overexpression of the Doc2α fragments on the localization of cathepsin D, large dot-like structures were scattered throughout the cytoplasm in the untransfected cells (Fig. 3 B). This staining indicates that mature cathepsin D is localized in lysosomes. Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Doc2α caused the disappearance of large dot-like structures. Overexpression of its C-terminal fragment showed the similar effect, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, overexpression of full-length Doc2α, the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3, its C-terminal fragment (data not shown), or full-length RP-3 (Fig. 3 B) did not affect the intracellular localization of cathepsin D. These results suggest that Doc2 is involved at least in the vesicle transport from early to late endosomes in cooperation with dynein in BHK cells.Figure 3Effect of the Doc2 mutants on the intracellular localization of CIMPR and cathepsin D.

The function of the light chains has been unknown, but our present results indicate that one of the light chains with a molecular mass of 14 kDa interacts with Doc2. The intracellular localization of Doc2β is unknown in nonneuronal cells, but our previous result, that Doc2α is localized on synaptic vesicles in neuronal cells (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A.

Taken together, Doc2 may link dynein to its cargos through interaction with tctex-1. Doc2 probably associates with cargos through its C-terminal region because overexpression of the C-terminal fragment of Doc2α shows a similar effect of overexpression of its N-terminal fragment containing the tctex-1-interacting domain.Cytoplasmic dynein is implicated in a broad range of cellular functions in addition to the vesicle transport from early to late endosomes (12Holzbaur E.L.F.

Doc2 may be involved in these dynein-dependent functions. Further study is necessary to establish the physiological role of the Doc2-tctex-1 system. We have isolated Doc2 as a novel protein having two C2-like domains that interact with Ca2+ and phospholipid (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Doc2 consists of two isoforms, Doc2α and -β (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M.

Doc2α is specifically expressed in neuronal cells and localized on synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals, whereas Doc2β is ubiquitously expressed (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T.

Both isoforms have at least one DSR1 (1–39 aa) at the N-terminal region and two C2-like domains at the C-terminal region (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H.

Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Doc2α containing DSR or its C-terminal fragment containing the C2-like domains in PC12 cells inhibits Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (5Orita S. Sasaki T.

We have recently isolated a protein interacting with Doc2α and -β and identified it to be Munc13–1 (6Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Doc2α and -β interact with Munc13–1 through the region within DSR (13–37 aa). Munc13–1 is specifically expressed in neuronal cells and localized on the presynaptic plasma membrane (7Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Munc13–1 has two C2-like domains and one C1-like domain that interacts with diacylglycerol or phorbol ester (7Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

The Doc2α-Munc13–1 interaction is induced by the binding of diacylglycerol or phorbol ester to the C1-like domain of Munc13–1 and causes the docking of the vesicles to the plasma membrane in nerve terminals (6Orita S.

To clarify the function of Doc2, particularly that of Doc2β, it is important to isolate a Doc2-interacting protein(s) that is ubiquitously expressed. We have attempted here to isolate a Doc2-interacting protein(s) from a rat brain cDNA library by use of the yeast two-hybrid system and identified it to be tctex-1. tctex-1 interacted with both Doc2α and -β at the N-terminal region. tctex-1 was originally isolated as a candidate for involvement in the transmission ratio distortion of mouset-haplotypes (10Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell. 1989; 58: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). tctex-1 has recently turned out to be a light chain of cytoplasmic dynein (11King S.M. Dillman III, J.F.

Cytoplasmic dynein interacts with a variety of structures, such as late endosomes, lysosomes, the Golgi complex, synaptic vesicles, and ER, and is implicated in transport of these organelles and vesicle transport between these organelles (12Holzbaur E.L.F.

We describe here the Doc2-tctex-1-interaction and discuss the function of this interaction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe first attempted to isolate a Doc2-interacting protein which is ubiquitously expressed by use of the yeast two-hybrid system with the N-terminal region (1–90 aa) of Doc2α as a bait from a rat brain cDNA library. Screening of 1 × 106 transformants yielded nine independent positive clones that interacted with Doc2α. The seven positive clones encoded Munc13–1 as described (6Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The remaining two positive clones had the same cDNA inserts with 0.75 and 0.73 kb, respectively. Using the cDNA with 0.75 kb as a probe, we isolated the cDNA encoding the whole open reading frame from a rat brain cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA revealed that the encoded protein consisted of 113 aa and showed a calculated M r of 12,438 (GenBankTM accession number AB010119) (Fig. 1 A). The deduced aa sequence of this molecule had 96% identity with mouse tctex-1 (GenBankTM accession number M25825) (10Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell. 1989; 58: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and 52% identity with human RP-3 (GenBankTM accession number U02556) (16Roux A.F. Rommens J. McDowell C. Anson-Cartwright L. Bell S. Schappert K. Fishman G.A. Musarella M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). RP-3 was isolated as a candidate gene of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa type 3 (16Roux A.F. Rommens J. McDowell C. Anson-Cartwright L. Bell S. Schappert K. Fishman G.A. Musarella M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that the cloned cDNA is rat tctex-1 cDNA. The rat tctex-1 mRNA level was examined in various rat tissues by Northern blot analysis. The tctex-1 mRNA appeared as a single band of approximately 0.8 kb and was ubiquitously expressed, although it was abundantly expressed in testis (data not shown). These results suggest that tctex-1 is a Doc2-interacting protein that is ubiquitously expressed.The minimum region of Doc2α required for the interaction with tctex-1 was 1–32 aa of Doc2α (Fig. 2 A, a). Doc2β also interacted with tctex-1 (Fig. 2 A, b). The tctex-1-interacting region of Doc2α showed striking sequence homology to that of Doc2β (85% identity). Although RP-3 showed sequence homology to tctex-1, RP-3 did not interact with Doc2α or -β (Fig. 2 A, b). These results suggest that the Doc2-tctex-1 interaction is specific.The Doc2-tctex-1 interaction was confirmed by the binding of in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled tctex-1 to the GST-tagged N-terminal region of Doc2α (1–90 aa) (Fig. 2 B). In vitro translated RP-3 did not bind to the GST-tagged N-terminal region of Doc2α. The Doc2-tctex-1 interaction was furthermore confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from cultured HeLa cells of Flag-tagged full-length tctex-1 and HA-tagged full-length Doc2α (Fig. 2 C). Flag-tagged full-length RP-3 was not co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged full-length Doc2α (data not shown). These results indicate that tctex-1 interacts with Doc2 in both cell-free and intact cell systems.It has been shown that dynein is involved in the vesicle transport from early to late endosomes (24Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). CIMPR and its ligand, cathepsin D, are transported from trans-Golgi network to early endosomes and then from early to late endosomes in BHK cells (25Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We finally examined whether the Doc2-tctex-1 interaction is involved in this dynein-dependent vesicle transport. When the intracellular localization of CIMPR in BHK cells was analyzed by immunocytochemistry using the anti-CIMPR antibody, CIMPR was distributed in a compact juxtanuclear region corresponding to late endosomes (Fig. 3 A). Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Doc2α containing the tctex-1-binding region induced the dispersion of CIMPR. The severity of this change varied somewhat among transfected cells, usually as a result of variation in expression levels of Doc2α. Overexpression of the C-terminal fragment containing C2-like domains showed the similar effect, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, overexpression of full-length Doc2α did not affect the intracellular localization of CIMPR (data not shown). To determine the specificity of the effect of the Doc2 mutants, we used the similar mutants of rabphilin3, which is a downstream target of the Rab3 small G protein subfamily implicated in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis and has two C2-like domains (26Shirataki H.

Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 containing Rab3-binding domain, its C-terminal fragment containing C2-like domains (data not shown) (27Yamaguchi T. Shirataki H. Kishida S.

Screening of 1 × 106 transformants yielded nine independent positive clones that interacted with Doc2α. The seven positive clones encoded Munc13–1 as described (6Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The remaining two positive clones had the same cDNA inserts with 0.75 and 0.73 kb, respectively. Using the cDNA with 0.75 kb as a probe, we isolated the cDNA encoding the whole open reading frame from a rat brain cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA revealed that the encoded protein consisted of 113 aa and showed a calculated M r of 12,438 (GenBankTM accession number AB010119) (Fig. 1 A). The deduced aa sequence of this molecule had 96% identity with mouse tctex-1 (GenBankTM accession number M25825) (10Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell. 1989; 58: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and 52% identity with human RP-3 (GenBankTM accession number U02556) (16Roux A.F. Rommens J. McDowell C. Anson-Cartwright L. Bell S. Schappert K. Fishman G.A. Musarella M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). RP-3 was isolated as a candidate gene of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa type 3 (16Roux A.F. Rommens J. McDowell C. Anson-Cartwright L. Bell S. Schappert K. Fishman G.A. Musarella M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that the cloned cDNA is rat tctex-1 cDNA. The rat tctex-1 mRNA level was examined in various rat tissues by Northern blot analysis. The tctex-1 mRNA appeared as a single band of approximately 0.8 kb and was ubiquitously expressed, although it was abundantly expressed in testis (data not shown). These results suggest that tctex-1 is a Doc2-interacting protein that is ubiquitously expressed. The minimum region of Doc2α required for the interaction with tctex-1 was 1–32 aa of Doc2α (Fig. 2 A, a). Doc2β also interacted with tctex-1 (Fig. 2 A, b). The tctex-1-interacting region of Doc2α showed striking sequence homology to that of Doc2β (85% identity). Although RP-3 showed sequence homology to tctex-1, RP-3 did not interact with Doc2α or -β (Fig. 2 A, b). These results suggest that the Doc2-tctex-1 interaction is specific. The Doc2-tctex-1 interaction was confirmed by the binding of in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled tctex-1 to the GST-tagged N-terminal region of Doc2α (1–90 aa) (Fig. 2 B). In vitro translated RP-3 did not bind to the GST-tagged N-terminal region of Doc2α. The Doc2-tctex-1 interaction was furthermore confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from cultured HeLa cells of Flag-tagged full-length tctex-1 and HA-tagged full-length Doc2α (Fig. 2 C). Flag-tagged full-length RP-3 was not co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged full-length Doc2α (data not shown). These results indicate that tctex-1 interacts with Doc2 in both cell-free and intact cell systems. It has been shown that dynein is involved in the vesicle transport from early to late endosomes (24Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). CIMPR and its ligand, cathepsin D, are transported from trans-Golgi network to early endosomes and then from early to late endosomes in BHK cells (25Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We finally examined whether the Doc2-tctex-1 interaction is involved in this dynein-dependent vesicle transport. When the intracellular localization of CIMPR in BHK cells was analyzed by immunocytochemistry using the anti-CIMPR antibody, CIMPR was distributed in a compact juxtanuclear region corresponding to late endosomes (Fig. 3 A). Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Doc2α containing the tctex-1-binding region induced the dispersion of CIMPR. The severity of this change varied somewhat among transfected cells, usually as a result of variation in expression levels of Doc2α. Overexpression of the C-terminal fragment containing C2-like domains showed the similar effect, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, overexpression of full-length Doc2α did not affect the intracellular localization of CIMPR (data not shown). To determine the specificity of the effect of the Doc2 mutants, we used the similar mutants of rabphilin3, which is a downstream target of the Rab3 small G protein subfamily implicated in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis and has two C2-like domains (26Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and full-length RP-3, which does not interact with Doc2 in both cell-free and intact cell systems. Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 containing Rab3-binding domain, its C-terminal fragment containing C2-like domains (data not shown) (27Yamaguchi T. Shirataki H. Kishida S. Miyazaki M. Nishikawa J. Wada K. Numata S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27164-27170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or full-length RP-3 (Fig. 3 A) showed no effect. As to the effect of overexpression of the Doc2α fragments on the localization of cathepsin D, large dot-like structures were scattered throughout the cytoplasm in the untransfected cells (Fig. 3 B). This staining indicates that mature cathepsin D is localized in lysosomes. Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Doc2α caused the disappearance of large dot-like structures. Overexpression of its C-terminal fragment showed the similar effect, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, overexpression of full-length Doc2α, the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3, its C-terminal fragment (data not shown), or full-length RP-3 (Fig. 3 B) did not affect the intracellular localization of cathepsin D. These results suggest that Doc2 is involved at least in the vesicle transport from early to late endosomes in cooperation with dynein in BHK cells. Cytoplasmic dynein consists of two heavy chains, three intermediate chains, four light intermediate chains, and three light chains (11King S.M. Dillman III, J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J.

Of these subunits, the heavy chains have ATPase activity and interact with microtubules (12Holzbaur E.L.F. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 13Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Hirokawa N. Noda Y.

The intermediate chains and dynactin are suggested to interact with cargos (13Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Hirokawa N. Noda Y.

The function of the light chains has been unknown, but our present results indicate that one of the light chains with a molecular mass of 14 kDa interacts with Doc2. The intracellular localization of Doc2β is unknown in nonneuronal cells, but our previous result, that Doc2α is localized on synaptic vesicles in neuronal cells (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), suggests that Doc2β is associated with some specific vesicles in nonneuronal cells. Taken together, Doc2 may link dynein to its cargos through interaction with tctex-1. Doc2 probably associates with cargos through its C-terminal region because overexpression of the C-terminal fragment of Doc2α shows a similar effect of overexpression of its N-terminal fragment containing the tctex-1-interacting domain. Cytoplasmic dynein is implicated in a broad range of cellular functions in addition to the vesicle transport from early to late endosomes (12Holzbaur E.L.F. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 13Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Hirokawa N. Noda Y.

Doc2 may be involved in these dynein-dependent functions. Further study is necessary to establish the physiological role of the Doc2-tctex-1 system.

https://openalex.org/W2012867878,"We have expressed the human neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR) in the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 as a model to study intracellular transport and subcellular sorting signals in intestinal cells. p75NTR was localized at the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells and reached this membrane mainly via an indirect pathway. Apical localization, intracellular routing, and basolateral to apical transcytosis were not affected by truncation of the cytoplasmic domain or replacement of the transmembrane domain by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor. Removal of membrane anchoring resulted in basolateral secretion of the ectodomain of p75NTR in Caco-2 cells but in apical secretion in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Substitution of potentialO-glycosylation sites present in the stalk of p75NTR led to intracellular cleavage and secretion of the ectodomain into the basolateral medium both in Caco-2 and MDCK cells. These results suggest that the stalk of p75NTR carries an apical sorting information that is recognized efficiently by Caco-2 cells only when attached to the membrane. This apical sorting information is linked to the presence of predictedO-glycosylation sites in that region. These putative O-glycosylation sites also play a role in the regulation of p75NTR transport to the cell surface and in the prevention of rapid degradation by cleavage of the stalk domain."

These features arise from hypervelocity impacts by ∼10-centimeter meteoroids into F ring bodies. Future ring observations of these impact events could constrain the centimeter-sized component of the meteoroid population, which is otherwise unmeasurable but plays an important role in the evolution of rings and surfaces in the outer solar system. The F ring's numerous other clumps are much longer lived and appear to be unrelated to impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2058186528,"Interferon (IFN) induction of immediate-early response genes is mediated through the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Activation of STAT1 by IFNα or IFNγ through its tyrosine phosphorylation involves members of the Jak tyrosine kinases. In addition, STAT2 is activated by IFNα, and, together with STAT1 and p48/ISGF3γ, forms the transcription factor complex ISGF3. Previous findings suggested that the STAT1-SH2 domain, which is required for the homo- or heterodimerization of STAT1, also participates in the recruitment of STAT1 to the IFN-receptors, because mutations in the SH2-domain abolished STAT1 activation by IFNγ. Furthermore, STAT2 was reported to be required for the activation of STAT1 by IFNα. We were able to induce STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation by IFNα/β in the absence of STAT2 or a functional STAT1-SH2 domain. In contrast, IFNγ was unable to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1-(SH2:Arg → Gln). Interestingly, although STAT1 was found in the nucleus in STAT2-deficient cells, the nuclear accumulation of the tyrosine phosphorylated SH2-mutant STAT1 was impaired. In summary, our results indicate that the SH2 domain of STAT1 is not required for its ligand-dependent activation by IFNα/β. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation is not sufficient to target STAT1 to the nucleus; rather, dimerization appears to play a critical role in the subcellular distribution of STAT1.

More recently, Li et al. demonstrated that STAT1 and STAT2 are prebound to the inactive IFNAR2c chain and that this association requires the N-terminal region of STAT2 (28Li X. Leung S. Kerr I. Stark G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).After its tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT1 either homodimerizes or forms heterodimers when STAT2 is activated by IFNα/β to translocate to the nucleus where site-specific binding to enhancer elements leads to gene activation (29Gupta S.

Nuclear import is often controlled by binding of a karyophilic protein that contains a single or bipartite nuclear localization signal to the nuclear pore, with subsequent import in a GTP hydrolysis-dependent manner. Although the dependence of STAT1 nuclear import in response to IFNγ on the GTPase activity of Ran/TC4 has been demonstrated (31Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31017-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), no nuclear localization signal has been identified in any of the STAT proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is an absolute prerequisite for its nuclear translocation and its ability to bind DNA (32Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E.

This defect in the ability to activate an SH2 domain-mutated STAT1 (STAT1-SH2mut) made it thus far impossible to determine whether dimerization is required for nuclear translocation of STAT1 or whether the phosphorylated tyrosine residue serves as a binding site for a potential transport protein.Here we demonstrate the activation of STAT1 by IFNα/β, but not IFNγ, in the absence of a functional STAT1-SH2 domain; furthermore, we show STAT1 activation by IFNα/β in STAT2-deficient cells. Importantly, whereas the lack of STAT2 did not affect the nuclear localization of STAT1, the abrogation of STAT1-SH2 domain function resulted in the inability of STAT1 to translocate to the nucleus despite its tyrosine phosphorylation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSignificant progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the activation of STAT proteins through numerous cytokine and growth factor receptors. However, very little is known about the process of nuclear translocation of STAT proteins after their tyrosine phosphorylation. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is required for its nuclear localization, it remains unclear whether phosphorylation of Tyr701 is solely required for STAT dimerization or whether a cytosolic transport protein utilizes this phosphotyrosine residue as a docking site. Previous findings suggested that the SH2 domain of STAT1 was required to recruit latent STAT1 to activated receptors (29Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S. Krolewski J. Schindler C.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Consequently, the reverse approach of introducing an Arg → Gln mutation in the SH2 domain to render it incapable of binding phosphotyrosine and preventing dimerization was unsuccessful, because a STAT1 carrying such a mutation did not become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IFN or epidermal growth factor (34Improta T.

Nature. 1993; 366: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).It has been previously shown that incubation of cells with a combination of 1 mm hydrogen peroxide and 0.1 mm orthovanadate (H/V) results in the ligand-independent activation of STAT proteins (43Igarashi K. David M. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 44Haque S. Wu Q. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Smith J. Kerr I. Stark G. Williams B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This treatment even proved effective in the activation of STAT1 in the absence of the Jak tyrosine kinases that are required for STAT activation (44Haque S. Wu Q. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Smith J. Kerr I. Stark G. Williams B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), indicating that this procedure effectively bypasses the need for receptor-mediated signaling. We therefore decided to explore the possibility that this treatment might also activate a STAT1 carrying the Arg → Gln mutation in the SH2 domain. Indeed, exposure of either wild-type 2ftgh cells or STAT1-deficient U3A cells stably expressing STAT1-SH2mut to H/V resulted in the IFN-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT1-SH2mut, respectively (data not shown). However, this treatment appeared to be extremely toxic to cells, because we found that it not only failed to target tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type STAT1 into the nucleus, but it also prevented the nuclear translocation of wild-type STAT1 when IFN was added after H/V, despite the fact that this costimulation resulted in a further increase in STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown).We therefore decided to titrate the concentration of H/V to a level where it did not affect the normal nuclear translocation of wild-type STAT1 after stimulation of cells with IFN. It was found that a significantly lower concentration of H/V (referred to as h/v, to indicate 10 μm hydrogen peroxide and 5 μmorthovanadate) did not interfere with the nuclear translocation of wild-type STAT1 after IFN stimulation (see Fig. 3 A, lower panel) but was also unable to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type STAT1 or STAT1-SH2mut (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 5). Surprisingly, however, although the exposure of cells to this low concentration of h/v did not cause tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT1-SH2mut by itself, it promoted the subsequent activation of STAT1-SH2mut by IFNα/β. In contrast, IFNγ was still unable to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1-SH2mut (Fig. 1 B, lane 8). Interestingly, we were also able to detect a weak but reproducible tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1-SH2mut through stimulation with IFNα/β alone but not with IFNγ. This is in contrast to previous reports suggesting that STAT1 could not become phosphorylated in the absence of a functional SH2 domain; however, these studies were predominantly focused on STAT1 activation by IFNγ or epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, we believe that the use of phosphoSTAT1-specific antiserum results in increased sensitivity compared with phosphotyrosine blots, allowing for the detection of low levels of STAT1 phosphorylation. It thus appears that the priming of cells with a subthreshold concentration of h/v facilitates an increase in the activation of STAT1-SH2mut after IFNα/β while preserving theIFN-dependent nature of the stimulation. Earlier studies showed that in some cases the autophosphorylation sites of receptors are dispensable for STAT activation, leaving the possibility that the STAT-SH2 domain binds to a receptor-associated, tyrosine phosphorylated protein (24David M.

In contrast, our findings suggest for the first time the presence of an alternate mechanism for recruitment of a STAT protein to an activated cytokine receptor that does not involve the SH2 domain of the STAT protein.Figure 1Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in the absence of STAT1-SH2 domain or STAT2. 2ftgh (A), U3A reconstituted with STAT1-SH2mut (B), and U6A (C) were stimulated for 30 min with either IFNα (500 units/ml), IFNβ (500 units/ml), or IFNγ (10 ng/ml) without (lanes 1–4) or with (lanes 5–8) prior priming of cells for 30 min with h/v (10 μm/5 μm). Whole cell extracts (15 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antiserum directed against the C terminus of STAT1, and isolated proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, activated STAT1 was detected with a polyclonal anti- (Tyr701)PhosphoSTAT1 antibody. Loading of equal amounts of STAT1 was confirmed by reprobing with STAT1 antiserum (data not shown). CTL, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because it had been reported that STAT2 is essential for activation of STAT1 by IFNα (27Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether h/v priming could also overcome this requirement. Indeed, whereas IFNα/β alone activates STAT1 only weakly in STAT2-deficient U6A cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 3), the pretreatment with h/v before addition of IFNα/β restored the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation to levels comparable with those seen in wild-type cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes 6 and 7). As was the case with STAT1-SH2mut, h/v treatment alone did not lead to any detectable tyrosine phosphorylation in the U6A cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 5).To analyze the DNA binding capabilities of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1-SH2mut or of STAT1 activated by IFNα in the absence of STAT2, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the GRR sequence of the high affinity FcγRI promoter as a probe. As shown in Fig. 2 C, tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 in U6A cells lysates was able to bind to the GRR as expected and confirmed the results of the phosphoSTAT1 Western blots. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1-SH2mut was unable to form a complex capable of binding the GRR (Fig. 2 B) or to assemble with activated STAT2 into the interferon-stimulated response element-binding ISGF3 complex (data not shown). These results confirm that the SH2 domain of STAT1 is required for formation of a dimerizing DNA binding complex but is expendable for achieving tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IFNα/β.Figure 2Effect of h/v priming on EMSA of 2ftgh, U6A, and U3A/STAT1-SH2mut. 2ftgh (A), U3A reconstituted with STAT1-SH2mut (B), and U6A (C) were stimulated for 30 min with either IFNα (500 units/ml), IFNβ (500 units/ml), or IFNγ (10 ng/ml) without (lanes 1–4) or with (lanes 5–8) prior priming of cells for 30 min with h/v (10 μm/5 μm). Whole cell extracts were prepared, and EMSAs were performed using the end-labeled GRR as a probe. CTL, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our primary goal was to investigate whether the dimerization of STAT1 was required for its nuclear translocation or whether tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 is transported into the nucleus as a monomer. We therefore resorted to immunohistochemistry to analyze the subcellular localization of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1-SH2mut or of IFNα-activated STAT1 in the absence of STAT2. As shown in Fig. 3 A (upper panel), IFNα-activated, tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 translocated efficiently into the nucleus, with h/v priming apparently enhancing the level of translocation (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). STAT2-deficient U6A cells displayed, in good correlation with the low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, only marginal translocation of STAT1 to the nucleus in response to IFNα/β alone (Fig. 3 C, upper panel). However, h/v priming was able to facilitate substantial nuclear presence of STAT1 in response to IFNα/β (Fig. 3 C, lower panel).In contrast, no STAT1-SH2mut could be detected in the nucleus after any of the treatments (Fig. 3 B), despite proper phosphorylation of the protein on Tyr701 in response to IFNα/β after h/v priming. These results demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation per se, although required, is not sufficient to target STAT1 to the nucleus. Rather, the dimerization of STAT proteins appears to be the essential mediator of nuclear translocation. It is theoretically possible that h/v priming is able to promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1-SH2mut in response to IFNα/β but is unable to facilitate any additional phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues that could be required for STAT1 translocation to the nucleus. However, thus far the only reported ligand-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1 occurs on Ser727 (46Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), a residue that is absent in the STAT1β splice variant. Nevertheless, STAT1β is still able to translocate to the nucleus in response to IFN stimulation.In conclusion, our results show for the first time that STAT1 can be rapidly activated in a ligand-dependent manner even in the absence of a functional SH2 domain, demonstrating that the binding of the STAT1-SH2 domain to receptor phosphorylation sites is not the only mechanism that allows STAT1 to interact with an activated cytokine receptor. In contrast, an intact SH2 domain is required in order for STAT1 to be imported into the nucleus. These results lead to the conclusion that STATs need to form homo- or heterodimers in the cytoplasm to cross the nuclear membrane. Interferons as well as many other cytokines and growth factors mediate their biological effects through the induction of a set of immediate-early response genes (1Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L.

The particular significance of the KH domain was implicated by a point mutation altering a conserved isoleucine 304 to asparagine in the second KH domain of FMR1 (22DeBoulle K. Verkerk A.J.M.H.

In mice, the quaking viable mutation severely impairs myelination and as a result, mice develop a rapid tremor at postnatal day 10 (27Sidman R.L. Dickie M.M. Appel S.H. Science. 1964; 144: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A missense mutation in the GSG domain of Qk1 is embryonic lethal (8Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This point mutation has been shown to prevent homodimerization and may be the reason for the lethality observed in mice (18Chen T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The Drosophila Bicaudal C (Bic-C) contains five KH domains and gene lesions that truncate the Bic-C protein or a point mutation that replaces glycine 295 with an arginine in the third KH domain are strong alleles, leading to defects in RNA binding, oogenesis, and anterior-posterior embryonic patterning (28Mahone M.

A point mutation in the KH domain of Who/How has been identified and results in flies with “wings held out” (11Baehrecke E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1323-1332PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we report the cloning of two new DrosophilaGSG domain family members that we have called SAM and KEP1. SAM bears homology to the mammalian Sam68 and may be its homolog, whereas KEP1 is a unique family member. SAM is a cytoplasmic protein expressed in early embryos and female flies. KEP1 is a nuclear protein that is expressed at all stages of Drosophila development. KEP1 and SAM are RNA-binding proteins that bind homopolymeric RNA in vitro and self-associate into multimers. We further show that extracts from KEP1- and SAM-transfected Drosophila S2 cells trigger chromatin condensation and apoptotic body formation, in vitro events known to be caspase-dependent (30Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar,31Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evans G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have identified two GSG domain protein family members in Drosophila, SAM and KEP1. SAM is a cytoplasmic protein that has 50% sequence identity with Sam68 in the GSG domain and may represent the Drosophila homolog of Sam68. In addition to amino acid similarities in the GSG domain, SAM also contains a tyrosine-rich COOH terminus that may serve as a substrate for tyrosine kinases as has been shown for Sam68 (4Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 32Richard S., Yu, D. Blumer K.J. Hausladen D.

SAM is an RNA-binding protein, and it bound both poly(U) and poly(A) homopolymeric RNA in vitro. This binding specificity is similar to that observed with Sam68 and GRP33 (16Chen T. Damaj B. Herrerra C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). SAM self-associated and deletion studies demonstrated that the SAM GSG domain was required for both RNA binding and self-association like Sam68 (16Chen T. Damaj B. Herrerra C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although SAM has many similarities with Sam68 it is clearly different. SAM is cytoplasmic, whereas Sam68 is predominantly nuclear (data not shown and Ref. 4Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The localization of SAM suggests that it may be involved in some aspect of translation or mRNA stability. The presence of SAM in ovaries is consistent with this hypothesis because translation control is an important mechanism of gene regulation in that tissue (44Rongo C. Lehmann R. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 102-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).KEP1 is a 40-kDa RNA-binding protein that bound poly(U) homopolymeric RNA. It is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that most likely self-associates into homotrimers, as determined from the molecular mass of the chemical cross-linked complex in HeLa cells (data not shown). KEP1 cross-linked complexes were able to bind homopolymeric RNAin vitro, supporting the idea that GSG domain-containing proteins bind RNA as multimers (16Chen T. Damaj B. Herrerra C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The self-association property is now shared by eight different GSG domain proteins including Sam68, GRP33, mouse Qk1–7, GLD-1 (16Chen T. Damaj B. Herrerra C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Chen T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), Xqua (17Zorn A.M. Krieg P.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2176-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and SAM, KEP1, and Who/How (this report). All GSG domain proteins identified thus far have been shown to associate with RNA in vitro (4Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 9Zorn A.M. Grow M. Patterson K.D. Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Artzt K. Krieg P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 188: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Arning S. Gruter P. Bilbe G. Kramer A. RNA. 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen T. Damaj B. Herrerra C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The multimer formation may be required for high affinity binding to their target RNA sequences. The GSG domain-containing family of proteins is growing rapidly (for a review, see Ref. 14Vernet C. Artzt K. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 479-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).Drosophila partial sequences of 27 amino acids in the KH domain were cloned for four quaking-related proteins (12Fyrberg C. Becker J. Barthmaier P. Mahaffey J. Fyrberg E. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sequence of these four proteins has been recently reported, and the proteins were named QKR58E1, E2, E3, and B (45Fyrberg C. Becker J. Barthmaier P. Mahaffey J. Fyrberg E. Biochem. Genet. 1998; 36: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). QKR54B and QKR58E3 are SAM and KEP1, respectively. QKR58E1 and QKR58E2 are novel GSG domain family members. Taken together, these findings demonstrate thatDrosophila has at least five GSG domain-containing family members.The Drosophila Who/How is expressed in invaginating mesoderm during early embryogenesis (11Baehrecke E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1323-1332PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fyrberg C. Becker J. Barthmaier P. Mahaffey J. Fyrberg E. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Zaffran S. Astier M. Gratecos D. Semeriva M. Development. 1997; 124: 2087-2098PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of Who/How subsequently becomes restricted to the myogenic lineage including the cardioblasts and myoblasts (11Baehrecke E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1323-1332PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fyrberg C. Becker J. Barthmaier P. Mahaffey J. Fyrberg E. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Weak alleles are embryonic lethal or cause wing defects because of improper myotube migration and attachment (11Baehrecke E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1323-1332PubMed Google Scholar). These data implicate Who/How in muscle cell determination and a number of functions including control of heart rate in late embryogenesis (13Zaffran S. Astier M. Gratecos D. Semeriva M. Development. 1997; 124: 2087-2098PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of apoptosis in Who/How-transfected cells is consistent with the idea that Who/How plays a role in differentiation. Although we have recently shown that Qk1–7 induces apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells (18Chen T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), it will be necessary to examine whether the Who/How mouse equivalent, Qk1–5, also induces apoptosis. Our data confirm the nuclear localization of Who/How (13Zaffran S. Astier M. Gratecos D. Semeriva M. Development. 1997; 124: 2087-2098PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrate that Who/How is an RNA-binding protein that can bind RNA as a multimer (data not shown). A missense mutation has been identified in the KH domain of Who/How (11Baehrecke E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1323-1332PubMed Google Scholar), and this point mutation did not affect the ability of Who/How to self-associate and bind homopolymeric RNA (18Chen T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).The expression of KEP1 in NIH 3T3 induced apoptosis, with greater than 70% of the transfected cells undergoing apoptosis 36 h after transfection. SAM- and Who/How-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were healthy and had no morphological changes associated with apoptosis. When expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, both KEP1 and SAM induced apoptotic activity. It remains unclear at this time why SAM did not induce apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells as it did in Drosophila S2 cells, the more physiologically relevant cell line for SAM. By using anin vitro system, we observed that extracts fromDrosophila S2 cells transfected with KEP1 or SAM could trigger dramatic morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis in isolated HeLa nuclei. These changes are identical to those induced by cycloheximide-treated S2 extracts (data not shown). Since cycloheximide has been demonstrated to activate caspases (31Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evans G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and morphological changes in HeLa nuclei are caspase-dependent (30Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 31Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evans G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we suspect that KEP1 and SAM induce apoptosis by activating theDrosophila caspases such as drICE (31Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evans G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and DCP-1 (46Song Z. McCall K. Stellar H. Science. 1997; 275: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The apoptosis induced by the overexpression of KEP1 and SAM did not require additional manipulations such as the reduction in serum as observed with c-Myc (47Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3295-3296Google Scholar). In this regard, SAM and KEP1 are similar to Reaper, HID, and GRIM, where the overexpression alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis in insect cells (48Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 330-3309Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 49Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).The identification of two new Drosophila GSG domain family members that we called SAM and KEP1 demonstrates the existence of a large family of GSG domain proteins. KEP1 and SAM are RNA-binding proteins that bind homopolymeric RNA in vitro and self-associate into multimers. Although our results strongly indicate a putative role for KEP1 and SAM in the regulation apoptosis, it remains to be determined whether these proteins have a toxic effect such as perturbing the normal cellular processes or are directly involved in caspase-mediated apoptosis. Since the name SAM is used for a protein domain (sterile alpha motif), we propose the name Sam50 for theDrosophila SAM protein. The K homology (KH)1domain is a protein module consisting of 70–100 amino acids that was originally identified as a repeated sequence in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (1Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The KH domain is an RNA binding motif that is thought to make direct protein-RNA contacts with a three-dimensional βααββα-fold (2Musco G. Stier G. Joseph C. Morelli M.A. Pastore A. Cell. 1996; 85: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Alignment of KH domains from various proteins (2Musco G. Stier G. Joseph C. Morelli M.A. Pastore A.

All these proteins contain a single extended KH domain included within a larger protein domain of ∼200 residues called the GSG (GRP33, Sam68, GLD-1) domain (7Jones A.R. Schedl T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This domain is also called STAR for signaltransduction and activator of RNA (14Vernet C. Artzt K. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 479-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The KH domain embedded in the GSG domain is approximately 26 amino acids longer than other KH domains with extra amino acids located in loops 1 and 4 (2Musco G. Stier G. Joseph C. Morelli M.A. Pastore A. Cell. 1996; 85: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although the function of the GSG domains remains unknown, this protein module has been shown to be required for self-association and RNA binding (15Lin Q. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27274-27280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Chen T. Damaj B. Herrerra C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2038120314,"Early metabolic events in Escherichia coli exposed to nalidixic acid, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and an inducer of the SOS system, were investigated by in vivoNMR spectroscopy, a technique that permits monitoring of bacteria under controlled physiological conditions. The energetics of AB1157 (wild type) and of its isogenic, SOS-defective mutants, recBC, lexA, and ΔrecA, were studied by31P and 19F NMR before, during, and after exposure to nalidixic acid. The content of the NTP in E. coli embedded in agarose beads and perfused at 36 °C was found to be 4.3 ± 1.1 × 10−18 mol/cell, yielding a concentration of ∼2.7 ± 0.7 mm. Nalidixic acid induced in the wild type and mutants a rapid 2-fold increase in the content of the NTP, predominantly ATP. This induction did not involve synthesis of uracil derivatives or breakdown of RNA and caused cell proliferation to stop. Removal of nalidixic acid after 40 min of treatment rescued the cells and resulted in a decrease of ATP to control levels and resumption of proliferation. However, in ΔrecA cells, which were more sensitive to the activity of the drug, ATP elevation could not be reversed, and ATP content continued to increase faster than in control cells. The results ruled out association between the elevation of ATP and the induction of the SOS system and suggested involvement of a process reminiscent of apoptosis in the stimulation of ATP synthesis. Thus, the presence of the RecA protein was found to be essential for reversing the ATP increase and cell rescue, possibly by its function in repair of DNA damage. Early metabolic events in Escherichia coli exposed to nalidixic acid, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and an inducer of the SOS system, were investigated by in vivoNMR spectroscopy, a technique that permits monitoring of bacteria under controlled physiological conditions. The energetics of AB1157 (wild type) and of its isogenic, SOS-defective mutants, recBC, lexA, and ΔrecA, were studied by31P and 19F NMR before, during, and after exposure to nalidixic acid. The content of the NTP in E. coli embedded in agarose beads and perfused at 36 °C was found to be 4.3 ± 1.1 × 10−18 mol/cell, yielding a concentration of ∼2.7 ± 0.7 mm.

Several antitumor and antibacterial drugs were shown to induce a rapid elevation in the total pool of the NTPs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Barbé J. Villaverde A. Guerrero R. Biochem. Biophys.

In Escherichia coli, bleomycin and UV radiation, which are also bacterial SOS activators, were shown to induce a rapid, transient, and 2-fold increase in ATP concentration (1Barbé J. Villaverde A.

Microbiol. 1984; 130: 2247-2251PubMed Google Scholar). The pronounced elevation of ATP was shown to be independent of oxidative phosphorylation and was therefore attributed to an unknown intracellular phosphorylation pathway (1Barbé J. Villaverde A. Guerrero R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, with UV a delayed and substantially smaller increase in ATP was found to occur in the recBC mutant (1Barbé J. Villaverde A. Guerrero R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas a complete inhibition of this increase occurred in a recBC mutant treated with bleomycin (2Guerrero R. Llagostera M. Villaverde A. Barbé J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 2247-2251PubMed Google Scholar). In wild type, Within ∼30 min of induction of ATP, the bacteria entered a recovery phase, and ATP rapidly declined to baseline levels (1Barbé J. Villaverde A. Guerrero R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Guerrero R. Llagostera M. Villaverde A. Barbé J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 2247-2251PubMed Google Scholar, 3Barbé J.

However, in the mutants with impaired SOS activity, such asrecA13 (defective RecA protein), recA430(deficient RecA protease activity), and lexA1 (cleavage resistant LexA repressor), recovery was impeded, and ATP levels remained elevated (1Barbé J.

These results indicated involvement of the SOS pathway in the return to normal NTP levels, i.e. the recovery phase (3Barbé J. Villaverde A. Cairo J. Guerrero R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The rapid increase in ATP after damage to DNA is not unique to prokaryotic cells and also occurs in mammalian cancer cells in response to chemotherapy (4Neeman M. Eldar H. Rushkin E. Degani H.

For example, in T47D clone 11 human breast cancer cells, adriamycin induced a fast transient increase of 30–50% in the NTP levels before cell death (4Neeman M. Eldar H. Rushkin E. Degani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Dahan-Grobgeld E. Margalit R. Degani H. Proceedings of The Society of Magnetic Resonance, Third Scientific Meeting and Exhibition and European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology Twelfth Annual Meeting and Exhibition. Nice Acropolis, Nice1995: 1698Google Scholar). The adriamycin-induced increase in the NTP levels was also observed in small cell lung carcinoma cultures (5de Jong S. Mulder N.H. de Vries E.G.E. Robillard G.T. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 63: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Other chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin in human ovarian carcinoma (6Berghmans K. Ruiz-Cabello J. Simpkins H. Andrews P.A. Cohen J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and hypoxanthine with methotrexate in rat lymphoma cells and in L1210 mouse leukemia cells (7Kwok J.B.J. Tattersall M.H.N. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) also induced an increase in ATP levels. The activity of many anticancer and antibacterial drugs appears to be related to their capacity to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II (9Chen G.L. Liu L.F. Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 1986; 21: 257-261Google Scholar, 10Huff A.C. Kreuzer K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20496-20505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type II topoisomerases catalyze changes in the topology of DNA by passing one segment of duplex DNA through a transient break in a second DNA segment. The reaction intermediary consists of a topoisomerase covalently linked, via a phosphotyrosine bond, to each 5′ terminus at the site of the DNA break (11Kupfer G. Bodley A.L. Liu L.F. NCI (Natl. Cancer Inst.) Monogr. 1987; 4: 37-40Google Scholar). Drugs such as adriamycin affect the DNA breakage and reunion reaction of mammalian DNA topoisomerase II by stabilizing the cleavable topoisomerase-DNA complex. It was previously suggested that inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II by chemotherapeutic drugs may cause an increase in ATP concentrations (11Kupfer G. Bodley A.L. Liu L.F. NCI (Natl. Cancer Inst.) Monogr. 1987; 4: 37-40Google Scholar). The bactericidal action of nalidixic acid serves as a model for the study of the mechanism of cytotoxicity by topoisomerase II-targeting antitumor drugs (11Kupfer G. Bodley A.L. Liu L.F. NCI (Natl. Cancer Inst.) Monogr. 1987; 4: 37-40Google Scholar). In the presence of the RecBCD nuclease, nalidixic acid is a strong inducer of SOS repair functions (12Karu A.E. Belk E.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 185: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 201: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), with the nuclease unwinding activity being the critical property (13Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 201: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this work, the effects of nalidixic acid on E. coli metabolism were characterized noninvasively by NMR studies, along with other standard methods. Although NMR spectroscopy was previously applied to investigate metabolic activities in suspensions of E. coli(14Ugurbil K. Shulman R.G. Brown T.R. Shulman R.G. Biological Application of Magnetic Resonance. Academic Press, New York1979: 527-539Google Scholar, 15Ugurbil K. Rottenberg H. Glynn P. Shulman R.G.

Bioeng. 1990; 36: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), monitoring metabolic changes in vivo over extended periods required the development of improved methods of cell encapsulation and perfusion that ensured controlled physiological conditions. These methods enabled us to follow intracellular metabolites during growth and after exposure to nalidixic acid.31P NMR was applied to monitor the phosphate metabolites, and 19F was applied to monitor fluoronucleotides derived from 5-fluorouracil (FUra)1incorporation. The involvement of the SOS response in the observed metabolic alterations was investigated by using ΔrecA, lexA, and recBC mutants in which the SOS system cannot be induced. Nalidixic acid was shown to induce a rapid increase in the content of the NTPs, predominantly ATP. This induction was found to be independent of the SOS response and appeared to be associated with an apoptotic-like process. The bacterial strains used here were derivatives of E. coli K-12 (Table I). A deletion of recA was introduced into AB1157 cells by P1 transduction using WBM535 (20Cohen-Fix O. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3300-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as the donor strain (21Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 107-111Google Scholar). The presence of the recA genotype was verified by the extreme sensitivity of the mutant to UV irradiation at 254 nm.Table IStrains of E. coli used in this studyStrainGenotypeRelevant mutationRef.AB1157argE3 hisG4 thr-1 leuB6 thi-1 supE44 Δ(gpt-proA)62 ara-14 galK2 lacY1 mtl-1 xyl-5 tsx-33 rfbD1 mg1–51 rpsL31Wild type18Kushner S.R.

The pH of this medium was adjusted to 7.5. The concentration of Pi in this medium was low, to bring the intensity of the Pi signal close to the intensities of the intracellular phosphate signals of the31P NMR spectra. We verified that this concentration was sufficient to maintain the same growth rate as in the high phosphate medium (generation time, ∼45 min for wild type, lexA3, and rec A mutants and 60 min for the recBC mutant). In experiments with FUra (Sigma), cells were were cultivated for several generations in the standard growth medium supplemented with 10–100 μm FUra. E. coli in mid-logarithmic growth (A = 0.5 at 595 nm) were exposed for 40 min to low concentrations of nalidixic acid (Sigma): 0.4 μg/ml and 1.4 μg/ml, equivalent to 1.6 × 10−9 and 5 × 10−9 μg/cell, respectively, or a high concentration of 40 μg/ml, equivalent to 1.6 × 10−7 μg/cell. Aliquots (100 μl) of the treated and untreated cultures were plated on Luria agar plates. The surviving colonies were counted after an overnight incubation at 37 °C. E. coli was grown in Luria Bertani medium to the mid-logarithmic phase of growth. Bacteria were treated with nalidixic acid (40 μg/ml) for 40 min. Control and treated bacteria were washed twice with Luria Bertani medium and then centrifuged. The pellets were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide for 2 h. The samples were then dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions and embedded in Epon (Polarbed 812 resin, Polaron, Watford, United Kingdom). Ultra thin sections were constructed with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and were examined with a Jeol JEM 1200 EXII microscope at 80 kV. Encapsulation of E. coli for NMR experiments: This method was adapted from the encapsulation method of the algae Dunalliella (22Bental M. Pick U. Avron M. Degani H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A day before an NMR experiment, ∼9 × 1010 cells were harvested in the mid-logarithmic phase of growth, resuspended in 3 ml of fresh growth medium and incubated briefly (∼5 min) at 37 °C. The suspension was then mixed thoroughly with 3 ml of a 6% low gelling agarose (Sigma) solution and added rapidly to stirred paraffin oil (100 ml), all of which were maintained at 37 °C and under sterile conditions. This procedure produced a uniform population of spherical agarose drops (300–500 μm diameter) containing the bacteria. Cooling of the paraffin oil to 10 °C yielded gelled spherical beads with entrapped cells (∼1.5 × 1010 cells/ml beads). These beads were separated from the paraffin oil and washed several times with fresh growth medium and kept at 4 °C overnight. The next day, 2.5 ml of the gelled agarose beads were transferred to a 10-mm NMR tube. The sample was placed in the spectrometer, and the cells embedded in the agarose beads were perfused at 36 ± 1 °C under sterile conditions, as described below. The standard growth medium described above was slightly modified for NMR use, containing a higher concentration of glucose (90 mm) and Tris base (165 mm) and a lower concentration of NaCl (57 mm). We verified that the growth rate in this modified medium was the same as in the standard medium with a generation time of ∼45 min. The increased glucose supply and increased buffer capacity (because of Tris) ensured adequate nutrition and a stable pH during the NMR experiments. In NMR experiments with FUra, the perfusion medium also contained 15 μm of the drug. Nalidixic acid was added at a concentration of 140 μg/ml, which was equivalent to a dose of ∼9.3 × 10−9 μg/cell. Below this concentration no change in the spectra could be observed, whereas a higher dose (∼50%) yielded similar results. A perfusion system, previously developed in our laboratory (22Bental M. Pick U. Avron M. Degani H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was adapted for the NMR studies (Fig. 1). The cells were perfused unidirectionally at a flow rate of 3 ml/min to ensure an adequate supply of glucose and oxygen. A bubble trap was added in the delivery line to prevent bubbles from entering the tube and perturbing the homogeneity of the magnetic field. The temperature in the NMR tube was adjusted to 36 ± 1 °C during the NMR experiments, using the variable temperature control unit (Bruker). The medium container outside of the spectrometer was saturated with humidified oxygen (100%) and kept at 39 ± 1 °C. Medium was changed by replacing the whole container with a new one containing the desired medium (e.g. with a fresh medium or one containing the drug). NMR measurements were performed with a Bruker AM-500 spectrometer equipped with a quadro-nuclei (1H, 31P, 13C, and 15N) probe or a Bruker AMX-400 spectrometer equipped with a triple-tuned (1H, 31P, and 19F), software-controlled probe. 31P spectra recorded at 202.5 MHz were obtained by collecting 760 transients within 13 min, applying 60° pulses with a 1-s repetition time, and proton decoupling with a composite pulse decoupling sequence of ∼1 watt. 31P spectra recorded at 164 MHz were obtained by collecting 1900 transients within 8.8 min, applying 55° pulses with a 0.42-s repetition time, and composite pulse decoupling during acquisition as above.19F spectra recorded at 376 MHz were obtained by collecting 1400 transients within 8.5 min, applying 60° pulses with a 0.24 s repetition time, and composite pulse decoupling during acquisition. The 19F and 31P spectra were recorded sequentially. In both spectrometers, the temperature of the sample was maintained at 36 ± 1 °C with a Bruker variable temperature control unit. The 31P and19F chemical shifts were determined in reference to the αNTP signal at −10.04 ppm and to the FUra signal at −171 ppm, respectively. Changes in the areas or the intensities of each signal were directly proportional to changes in the content of the corresponding metabolite. The areas of the signals were determined either by line shape simulation using the Bruker GLINFIT program or by applying the integral mode of the spectrometer. A comparative analysis of the relative changes in areas or intensities of the NTP signals yielded similar results that were within experimental error. NTP content per cell was estimated from the signal area of γNTP in the31P spectra of perfused cells (for example, see Fig. 2) in reference to the signal area of Pi attributable predominantly to the 2.18 mm inorganic phosphate in the medium, taking into account saturation effects as a result of the NMR acquisition parameters and the differences in theT 1 relaxation rates of γNTP (T 1 = 0.7 s) and Pi(T 1 = 5.4 s). In this study, the high cell density in the NMR sample and the high metabolic activity of the cells required a rapid and continuous supply of nutrients and oxygen, as well as a fast removal of inhibitory products and prevention of medium acidification. These demands were met by perfusing cells embedded in agarose beads unidirectionally, at a high rate (3 ml/min), with medium saturated with oxygen, containing a high concentration of glucose (90 mm) and Tris base (165 mm) to achieve high buffer capacity. The optimal concentrations of glucose and the buffer as well as the rate of perfusion were determined by modifying these parameters and measuring the NTP levels of the perfused cells by 31P NMR, aiming to reach maximal and reproducible levels within consecutive recordings (each for 12 min). The initial number of cells in the beads was measured before the encapsulation. However, it was not possible to determine exactly the number of cells at the end of the experiments, because isolation of the cells from the beads led to substantial cell death. At the start of each NMR experiment, the intensities of the phosphate signals were very low, close to the noise level. However, within the first 1–2 h of adaptation to the NMR perfusion conditions (at 36 °C), the intracellular phosphate signals including the three NTP resonances became detectable. From the area of the NTP signal relative to that of the external Pi signal of the medium (2.18 mm), taking into account saturation effects, the amount of NTP per cell was found to be 4.3 ± 1.1 × 10−18 mol/cell, yielding a cellular NTP concentration of ∼2.7 ± 0.7 mm. In control experiments, under constant perfusion conditions for ∼7 h, a large increase in the NTP signals was observed (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). This increase can be attributed only to an increase in the number of cells, because cellular NTP concentration remains the same under constant conditions (e.g. constant supply of nutrients and oxygen, constant pH, and constant temperature). The increase in NTP was logarithmic and reached saturation levels as expected for cell growth curves. From this logarithmic increase a generation time of ∼100 min was determined forE. coli entrapped in beads. This generation time was twice as long as that measured in suspension (∼45 min), presumably because of the high density of the bacteria in the agarose beads.Figure 4Modulation in the γNTP signal intensity of AB1157 cells in the course of long term (3-h) exposure to nalidixic acid. Cells embedded in beads were perfused in the NMR spectrometer at 36 ± 1 °C. Addition and removal of nalidixic acid (140 μg/ml) are indicated by filled and open arrows, respectively. Open and filled circles refer to control cells and to cells exposed to nalidixic acid, respectively. A.U., arbitrary unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 31P NMR spectra of cells perfused at 36 °C exhibited in addition to the NTP signals phosphomonoester signals, Pisignal predominantly attributable to the medium Pi (2.18 mm), and NAD and uridine diphosphosugar signals (Fig. 2). The signals of αNDP and βNDP overlap with the signals of αNTP and γNTP, respectively. The area of the γNTP plus βNDP signal was the same, within experimental error, as that of βNTP. We can therefore conclude that the content of NDP under the NMR perfusion conditions is below detection level, namely, [NDP] is <20% of [NTP]. The uridine diphosphosugar concentration in the cells was similar to the concentration of NTP. Changes in the phosphate metabolites induced by exposure to nalidixic acid were studied by 31P NMR in wild type, and therecBC, lexA, and ΔrecA mutants. In each experiment, two separate samples of the same cell preparation were monitored one after the other. The first sample was treated transiently with nalidixic acid (140 μg/ml), whereas the second one was continuously perfused with nalidixic acid-free medium and served as a control. Administration of nalidixic acid (for 40 min or 3 h) induced a rapid increase of ∼2-fold in the NTPs of all the strains tested (Figs. 3 and 4). Specifically, the extent in NTP elevation was 2.00 ± 0.20 (n = 6) for E. coli wild type, 2.10 ± 0.08 (n = 2) for recBC, 2.2 (n = 1) for lexA, and 1.7 ± 0.03 (n = 3) for ΔrecA, and substantially higher than the increase attributable only to the growth of the bacteria (Figs. 3 and 4, insets). The main induction occurred during the first 20 min of exposure to the drug. In the cells treated for 3 h with nalidixic acid, the initial 2-fold increase was followed by an additional but slower increase for 2 more h (Fig. 4). Removal of nalidixic acid from the perfusion medium after 40 min caused in E. coli wild type, recBC, and lexAa reduction in the induced NTP content to a level similar to that of untreated, control cells. This recovery was then followed by a gradual increase in the NTPs caused by normal cell growth. Exceptionally, in ΔrecA cells, despite removal of the nalidixic acid, the level of the NTPs remained high and did not return to control level, and a further increase occurred thereafter, two to three times faster than in ΔrecA control cells (Fig. 3 D). ThusE. coli ΔrecA cells were not able to recover from the nalidixic acid insult, and the induction of ATP synthesis could not be reversed. Long term treatment with nalidixic acid of E. coli wild type also inhibited rescue of the cells (Fig. 4). The cells did not recover; on the contrary, despite removal of nalidixic acid after 3 h of exposure, a drastic ∼4 fold decrease in NTP had occurred, indicating cell death (Fig. 4). Thus, it appears that during the longer exposure to the drug, the cells entered a process from which they could not be rescued anymore. Labeling of the NTP pool can provide a tool to monitor the source of the induction as a result of nalidixic acid administration. It was previously shown that when E. coli were grown in the presence of FUra, ∼70–95% of the FUra was incorporated into RNA (23Horowitz J. Ofengand J. Daniel Jr., W.E. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4418-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Marshall A.G. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5955-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Herein the incorporation of FUra was used as a tool to monitor changes in FUra derivatives during elevation of NTPs by nalidixic acid. The FUra derivatives included the soluble nucleotides F-UMP, F-UDP, and F-UTP, all of which can be monitored intracellularly by 19F NMR. In the presence of a low concentration of FUra, the growth of E. coli wild type was only slightly inhibited (Fig. 5). For the NMR experiments, wild type (n = 2) and ΔrecA (n= 2) were cultivated in the presence of a low concentration (15 μm) of FUra for 2–3 generations. The soluble nucleotides of the cells were then monitored by recording sequentially both31P spectra, which measured the total NTP pool, and19F spectra, which measured the content of fluorinated derivatives (Fig. 6).Figure 631 P and 19F NMR spectra of AB1157 cells before and during exposure to nalidixic acid.

The 19F spectra of these FUra-labeled cells exhibited two signals at 165.3 and 165.45 ppm, which were assigned, based on their chemical shift, to F-uridine diphosphosugar and F-UTP, respectively (Fig. 6 B). These two separate, but close, signals increased during cell growth before the addition of nalidixic acid, in parallel to the increase in NTPs. However, in the presence of nalidixic acid no change in either of the two fluorinated derivatives was observed, even though there was a substantial increase in NTP (Figs. 6 B and 7 B). After removal of the nalidixic acid, the level of the NTPs decreased to that of controls and was then followed by a gradual increase. In parallel, the incorporation of FUra was restored, and a gradual increase in the fluorinated uracil derivatives was observed (Fig. 7 B). Similar experiments with the ΔrecA mutant also showed that during the nalidixic acid-mediated induction of NTPs, no change in the fluorinated uracil derivatives was observed.

We investigated the interaction between GoαX and G protein-coupled receptors in vitro. First, we found that the activated m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (MAChR) could facilitate the exchange of XTPγS for XDP in the GoαXβγ heterotrimer. Second, the GoαXβγ complex was able to induce the high affinity ligand-binding state in the N-formyl peptide receptor (NFPR). These experiments demonstrated that GoαX was able to interact effectively with G protein-coupled receptors. Third, we found that the empty form of GoαX, lacking a bound nucleotide and βγ, formed a stable complex with the m2 muscarinic cholingeric receptor associated with the plasma membrane. Finally, we investigated the interaction of GoαX with receptor in COS-7 cells. The empty form of GoαX bound tightly to the receptor and was not activated because XTP was not available intracellularly. We tested the ability of GoαX to inhibit the activities of several different G protein-coupled receptors in transfected COS-7 cells and found that GoαX specifically inhibited Go-coupled receptors. Thus the modified G proteins may act as dominant-negative mutants to trap and inactivate specific subsets of receptors.

Hundreds of seven-transmembrane receptors activate heterotrimeric G proteins and transduce signals across cell membranes in eukaryotic cells. The stimulated receptors catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to G protein α subunits. Activated GTP-bound α subunits and free βγ subunits regulate a variety of cellular effectors including enzymes and ion-channels (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, 2Simon M.I. Strathman M.P. Gautam N.

Signaling is normally initiated by the binding of agonist to receptor, which stabilizes the receptor in an active conformation. Receptors function to stimulate the dissociation of GDP bound to the G protein α subunits. The subsequent binding of GTP to the empty α subunit promotes the conformational change of Gα and dissociation of the βγ subunits. The G protein α subunit in the nucleotide-free state appears to be an important intermediate in the activation. From studies of rhodopsin and transducin, it has been postulated that the empty G protein (nucleotide-free) forms a stable complex with the receptor (4Bornancin F. Pfister C. Chabre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both empty forms of Gi and Go α subunits have been purified under harsh conditions (1 m(NH4)2SO4 and 20% glycerol), and they were unstable (5Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).We recently reported that a mutant version of Goα, GoαX (GoαD273N/Q205L), was regulated by xanthine nucleotides, not by guanine nucleotides (6Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GoαX bound XDP1 and XTP instead of GDP or GTP. GoαX bound G protein βγ subunits only in the presence of XDP, and XTP stimulated dissociation of the GoαXβγ heterotrimer. XTP-bound GoαX underwent a conformational change similar to the activated wild-type Goα. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between GoαX and G protein-coupled receptors. We found that GoαX mutant proteins retained the receptor binding specificity of the wild-type Goα and were able to interact with Go-coupled receptors, such as the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (MAChR),N-formyl peptide receptor (NFPR), and thrombin receptor, but not with m1 MAChR or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor which do not couple to wild-type Go. Because the concentrations of XDP and XTP are relatively low in vivo (7Henderson J.F. Paterson A.R.P. Nucleotide Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1973: 97-169Crossref Google Scholar), GoαX mutant proteins are essentially nucleotide-free unless exogenous xanthine nucleotides are provided. Thus, GoαX provides an excellent model to study the receptor interaction of empty G protein α subunits. Consistent with the previously reported studies on the empty form of transducin (4Bornancin F. Pfister C. Chabre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), our data are most readily interpreted as showing that “empty” GoαX can form a stable complex with appropriate receptors on the membrane.DISCUSSIONGoαX (GoαD273N/Q205L) was the first reported mutant of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits that bound xanthine nucleotides, not guanine nucleotides (6Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It bound βγ only in the presence of XDP and could be activated by XTP. We continued to study the interaction of GoαX with G protein-coupled receptors in this report. The interaction of G proteins and their receptors is best demonstrated in two experiments: agonist-stimulated GTPγS binding of G protein α subunits and inhibition of high affinity ligand binding of the receptors by GTPγS. To test if GoαX can interact with G protein-coupled receptors and be activated by their agonists, we reconstituted purified GoαX with Sf9 cell membranes containing m2 MAChR or NFPR. First, we found that binding of XTPγS to GoαX was stimulated by the muscarinic agonist carbachol in the presence of m2 MAChR. In similar experiments using wild-type Goα, GTPγS binding was also stimulated by carbachol. In both cases, βγ was required for the carbachol-dependent nucleotide binding, suggesting that only GoαXβγ heterotrimer could interact with the receptors effectively. Second, we tested GoαX to determine whether it could induce the high affinity state in NFPR receptors expressed in Sf9 cells. The NFPR expressed in these cells is known to be in the low affinity state probably because of lack of mammalian Gi-like proteins in Sf9 cells (11Quehenberger O. Prossnitz E.R. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19757-19760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, we found that GoαX could convert NFPR into the high affinity state in the presence of βγ and XDP, and this effect was inhibited by XTP. These two experiments demonstrated that GoαX, when in complex with βγ and XDP, could interact with G protein-coupled receptors effectively and be activated by the agonists.Because cells lack xanthine nucleotides, GoαX provides an excellent model to study empty G protein α subunits. The empty form of Gα is an important intermediate in receptor activation and has long been proposed to form a stable complex with activated receptors. However stable interaction between empty G proteins and their receptors was only reported in the transducin-rhodopsin system. Empty transducin apparently formed a stable complex with light-activated rhodopsin and stayed on the rod outer segment membrane. Interestingly, deactivation of the rhodopsin did not lead to the dissociation of transducin from the complex (4Bornancin F. Pfister C. Chabre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that empty GoαX was able to bind to the receptor on the membrane in the absence of βγ subunits and without agonists, and the interaction could be abolished by either XDP or XTP. The amount of GoαX associated on the membranes with m2 MAChR was proportional to the amount of receptor at saturation. Interestingly, binding of GoαX alone did not convert the receptor to the high ligand affinity conformation, which required the αβγ complex. Therefore, the binding of GoαX alone to the receptor is not functional in contrast with the binding in the presence of βγ and XDP.Because GoαX appears to form a stable complex with the receptor, we tested whether GoαX could inhibit receptor activation in cells. In transfected COS-7 cells, we showed that GoαX was able to inhibit thrombin receptor or m2 MAChR stimulated PLCβ activities via the Gq or G15 pathway, but had no effect on m1 MAChR or TRH receptor stimulation. Because both thrombin receptor and m2 MAChR are known to couple with wild-type Go, and m1 MAChR and TRH receptor only couple with Gq, we interpret the data to mean that GoαX retained the receptor specificity of wild-type Go and was able to interact with Go-coupled receptors in cells. The inhibitory binding of GoαX enables us to specifically block Go-coupled receptors in certain systems. This could be a useful means to analyze different receptor-stimulated signal transduction pathways, and could perhaps be useful in drug screening associated with G protein-coupled receptors.In the previous report (6Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we showed that the single Goα mutant, GoαD273N, lost the ability to bind either guanine nucleotides or xanthine nucleotides and could not bind βγ under any conditions. Surprisingly, GoαD273N can still bind to receptors. In transfected COS-7 cells, we found that GoαD273N inhibited thrombin receptor and m2 MAChR activation, in a fashion similar to GoαX (Fig. 5,a and d). GoαD273N also retained the same receptor specificity as wild-type Goα; i.e. it had no effect on m1 MAChR or TRH receptor stimulated pathways (Fig. 5,b and c). In the Sf9 cell membrane binding assay, it only bound to the m2 MAChR membranes, not to the control wild-type Sf9 cell membranes. However in contrast to GoαX, GoαD273N was not released from the m2 MAChR membranes by XDP or XTP, consistent with its inability to bind nucleotides (data not shown). The reason that GoαD273N mutant proteins do not bind xanthine nucleotides is not clear. Apparently it must have a structure similar to that of the empty Goα which enables it to bind receptors, but the structure is probably not stable locally around the nucleotide binding pocket. Nevertheless, GoαD273N may also be useful as a dominant-negative inhibitor of receptor functions.

https://openalex.org/W2143698736,"The transmembrane domain that connects the extracellular and intracellular domains of cell-surface receptors must play a critical role in signal transduction. Here, we report studies of the interaction between the transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2) of the Escherichia coli aspartate chemoreceptor (Tar). Tar exists as a homodimer regardless of its state of ligand occupancy. A particular residue substitution in TM1 (A19K) abolishes the signaling ability of Tar. This signaling defect can be suppressed by single residue substitutions in TM2 (W192R, A198E, V201E, and V202L). We have found that these suppressors can be divided into two groups. A198E and V201E (class 1) almost completely suppress the defects caused by A19K, and this suppression occurs between two subunits of the Tar dimer. In contrast, W192R and V202L (class 2) fail to suppress some signaling defects, and their suppression does not occur between subunits. Because disulfide-crosslinking studies predict that residues 198 and 201 point toward residue 19 of the partner subunit, we propose that the class 1 suppressors form an intersubunit salt bridge with Lys19. Indeed, A19K was suppressed by several additional aspartate or glutamate substitutions on the same face of TM2 occupied by residues 198 and 201. None of these intersubunit salt bridges perturb signaling function, suggesting that the mechanism of transmembrane signal propagation does not involve large displacements (such as extensive rotation) of the TM1 and TM2 helices relative to each other."

To identify peptides that bind Kv1.1 we screened the library against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the predicted S4-S5 cytoplasmic loop of the Kv1.1 α-subunit (residues 313–328). Among the highest affinity interactors were peptides with significant homology to the amino terminus of Kvβ1. We performed a second screen using a peptide from the amino terminus of Kvβ1 (residues 2–31) as “bait” and identified peptide sequences with significant homology to the S4-S5 loop of Kv1.1. A series of synthetic peptides containing mutations of the wild-type Kvβ1 and Kv1.1 sequences were examined for their ability to inhibit Kvβ1/Kv1.1 binding. Amino acids Arg20 and Leu21 in Kvβ1 and residues Arg324 and Leu328 in Kv1.1 were found to be important for the interaction. Taken together, these data provide support for the contention that the S4-S5 loop of the Kv1.1 α subunit is the likely acceptor for the Kvβ1 inactivation domain and provide information about residues that may underlie the protein-protein interactions responsible for β-subunit mediated Kv channel inactivation.

Voltage-gated (Kv)1K+ channels are heteromeric protein complexes composed of four integral membrane ion-conducting α-subunits and four cytoplasmic β-subunits. These channels are critical for action potential conduction and neurotransmitter release and are fundamental to the control of neuronal excitability (1Rudy B.

The diversity of function of K+ channels is reflected in the heterogeneity of channels that have been found in the nervous system, both in terms of electrophysiological properties and in the multitude of genes that encode them (6Jan L.Y.

Electrophysiological studies have broadly classified Kv channels into two types: delayed-rectifier channels, which are characterized by their slow inactivation, and A-type Kv channels, which inactivate rapidly. Although the majority of Kv channel α-subunit cDNAs give rise to delayed-rectifier-type currents when expressed in heterologous cells, it has been demonstrated recently that certain β-subunits can dramatically alter the kinetics of channel inactivation when co-expressed with particular α-subunits (12Rettig J.

For example, co-expression of Kvβ1 with the delayed rectifier α-subunit Kv1.1 results in a channel that inactivates rapidly (12Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequences of cloned β-subunits taken together with mutagenesis studies indicates that the amino-terminal 30 amino acids of Kvβ1 contains a “ball” domain that is necessary and sufficient to rapidly inactivate Kv1.1 (12Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). This NH2-terminal inactivation domain of Kvβ1 shares primary amino acid sequence homology with the inactivation ball of the A-type Kv channels Kv1.4 and theDrosophila Shaker channel. Point mutations in the S4-S5 cytoplasmic loop of the Kv1.4 α-subunit, which lies near the inner mouth of the channel pore, indicate that this may be the acceptor site for the NH2-terminal inactivation ball (18Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 353: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and suggest that analysis of the interaction of NH2-terminal ball and S4-S5 “receptor” domains may provide clues to the structural requirements for N-type channel inactivation. Recently, a method to study protein-protein interactions has been developed in which constrained random peptides are displayed on the surface of bacteria as functional fusions to the protein flagellin (19Lu Z. Murray K.S. Van Cleave V. LaVallie E.R. Stahl M.L. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This enables large libraries of random and diverse polypeptides to be screened and specific peptides selected and characterized following their binding to an immobilized target protein. Due to the immense diversity of these libraries and the relative ease at which sequences can be identified, it is possible to rapidly obtain information about the structural requirements of high-affinity protein-protein interactions (20Scott J.K.

Random peptide libraries displayed on the surface of bacteria and phage have been employed successfully to identify protein phosphatase-1-binding motifs (26Zhao S. Lee E.Y.C. J. Biol.

In the present study we used this bacterial peptide display library screening strategy to examine the interaction of Kv channel α- and β-subunit domains. In addition, we utilized an in vitro protein interaction assay to examine analogs of these α- and β-subunits and identified key amino acid residues that are important for the interaction. We provide support for the contention that the S4-S5 loop of the Kv1.1 α-subunit is the likely acceptor for the Kvβ1 inactivation domain and provide information about residues that may underlie the protein-protein interactions responsible for β-subunit-mediated Kvchannel inactivation. A synthetic peptide (QILGQTLKASMRELGL) corresponding to amino acids (313–328) of the human Kv1.1 potassium channel α-subunit polypeptide was synthesized in both biotinylated and nonbiotinylated form (Genosys Biotechnologies, Woodlands, TX).

The GST- Kvβ1 fusions were purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cleaved from the GST by the addition of thrombin. All mutant peptides were synthesized as constrained 12-mers by Genosys Biotechnologies (Woodlands, TX). The FliTrx random peptide bacterial library was obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA); growth of the bacterial cultures and general panning methods are based on the system described previously (19Lu Z. Murray K.S. Van Cleave V. LaVallie E.R. Stahl M.L. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). 100 μg of Kvβ1 or Kv1.1 was immobilized on 60-mm plastic Petri dishes. The plates were washed with 10 ml of sterile water and nonspecific sites blocked with 10 ml of blocking solution (1% non-fat dry milk, 150 mm NaCl, 1% methylmannoside, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin in IMC medium) at room temperature for 1 h. All incubations were performed at 25 °C, and all other manipulations were at room temperature. An aliquot of the FliTrx library was grown to saturation for 15 h. 1010 cells were added to IMC medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml tryptophan to induce expression of the FliTrx plasmid and incubated for an additional 6 h. After library induction the culture was adjusted to a final concentration of 1% non-fat dry milk, 200 mm NaCl, and 1% methylmannoside. Subsequently, 10 ml of the induced cells were added to each culture plate for 1 h. Following binding each plate was washed three times with IMC/amp100 medium containing 1% methylmannoside. The bound cells were removed by vortexing in a residual amount of buffer and incubated in 10 ml of IMC at 25 °C for 14–16 h. Up to five rounds of panning were performed, after which the cultures were plated out and individual colonies selected. Plasmid minipreps were performed on the Qiagen BioRobot 9600 (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) and the resulting plasmid DNA sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer/ Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the FliTrx forward and reverse sequencing primers (Invitrogen). The resulting dodecamer DNA sequences were translated using DNAstar (Madison, WI) and Clustal analysis used to align the sequences and generate a consensus sequence. The resulting consensus sequences generated from days 2, 3, and 5 were similarly aligned to the wild-type sequences. Gaps in the consensus sequences signify that no consensus residue was identified at this position. The full-length Kvβ1 protein was immobilized onto Microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA,) for 1 h at 37 °C at a final concentration of 10 ng/well. The wells were then washed twice with Hepes-buffered saline (10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in Hepes-buffered saline. For binding, 100 ng of a biotinylated Kv1.1 (S4-S5 loop) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by detection with streptavidin, biotin-alkaline phosphatase, and developed withp-nitrophenyl phosphate. Peptides were tested in the assay system for inhibition of binding. IC50 values were calculated using the computer program Microsoft Excel 6.0 and p values calculated using the InStat 1.14 statistical program. The panning procedure was applied to identify peptides that bind the Kv1.1 channel S4-S5 loop and Kvβ1 NH2 terminus, using immobilized Kv1.1 (313–328) and Kvβ1 (2Hille, B.

Consensus sequences were identified by multiple alignment analysis, and in the search for Kv1.1 interactors, 92% of the clones analyzed overlapped in a core domain that can be readily found in the amino terminus of the human Kvβ1 subunit (Leu12-Lys13-Ser14-Arg15-Asn16-Gly17-Glu18-Asp19-Arg20-Leu21-Leu22-Ser23) (Table I). Conversely, a consensus motif identical to the S4-S5 loop of Kv1.1 (Gln317-Thr318-Leu319-Lys320-Ala321-Ser322-Met323-Arg324Glu325) was observed in peptides that bind Kvβ1 (Table II). These results support the hypothesis existing in the literature that implicates the S4-S5 loop of Kv1.1 as the receptor for the inactivation gate and Kvβ1 as a regulator of channel gating properties (12Rettig J.

Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and suggests that the interacting domains are smaller than previously thought. Individual amino acid residues within the consensus regions are conserved to varying degrees, possibly reflecting their differing contributions toward binding. In the Kvβ1 analogs the most highly conserved amino acids were Gly17 (65%), Arg20 (55%), and Leu21 (77%), whereas in the Kv1.1 analogs Arg324 was seen in 70% of the clones and Ala321 was represented in 46%.Table IAlignment of peptide sequences that bind to the Kv1.1 S4–S5 loop peptide Open table in a new tab Table IIAlignment of peptide sequences that bind to the Kvβ1 NH2-terminal peptide Open table in a new tab Panning enriches for high affinity binders and peptides from earlier days may bind with a lower affinity but contain amino acids critical for the interaction. To identify these key residues, plasmids isolated from days 1, 2, and 3 of panning were sequenced. For the Kvβ1 analogs day 1 produced no consensus sequence and contained 50% stop codons (18/36). Subsequently, days 2 (33% stop codons, 12/36) and 3 (17% stop codons, 6/36) showed 41 and 66% sequence conservation relative to the day 5 consensus sequence, respectively, and yielded the following consensus sequence, Arg15-X-Gly17-Glu18-Asp19-Arg20-Leu21(Fig. 1). The decrease in the number of stop codons is indicative of the enrichment of specific binding peptides within the library. Similarly, the Kv1.1 analogs on day 1 showed no homology to the wild-type sequence with ∼50% stop codons observed. The results of days 2 (22% stop codons, 8/36) and 3 (17% stop codons, 6/36) show a consensus of Thr318-Leu319-X-X-X-Met323-Arg324-Glu325-Leu326-X-Leu328, which has 62% sequence homology to day 5 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Kv1.1 consensus sequence emergence.

The wild-type sequences were analyzed and the IC50 for Kvβ1 wild-type peptide was calculated to be 9 ± 2 nm, the IC50 for Kv1.1 wild-type peptide was 15 ± 2 nm. The single mutants Kvβ1 R20A and L21A showed greatly reduced affinity (200- and 30-fold, respectively) when compared with the wild-type control sequence. Interestingly, these amino acids were conserved following just 2 days of panning, substantiating our belief that key residues would be conserved at these earlier days. Kvβ1 residues Arg15, Asn16, and Ser23 were also observed at day 3, although their mutation had only a small 2–3-fold effect on binding. Among the mutants tested for Kvβ1 was the triple mutant Kvβ1 G17S,E18G,D19N, since it had been reported in the literature to enhance the Kvβ1 mediated Kv1.1 inactivation. Suprisingly, in this study the triple mutant had no inhibitory effect (Fig. 3). Of the single mutants tested for Kv1.1, R324A completely abolished peptide inhibition of Kvβ1/Kv1.1 binding, S322A and L328A demonstrated marked decreases in affinity (60- to 100-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4). T318A (100 ± 2 nm) and E325A (100 ± 3 nm) showed smaller 6-fold decreases in binding affinity. Other residues investigated showed no effect.Table IIIInhibition of binding of Kvβ1/Kv1.1 by synthetic peptides in a K+ channel plate assaySynthetic peptidesIC50nmKvβ1 wild-typeLKSRNGEDRLLS9 ± 2Kvβ1 K13ALASRNGEDRLLS9 ± 4Kvβ1 S14ALKARNGEDRLLS10 ± 6Kvβ1 R15ALKSANGEDRLLS25 ± 43-ap < 0.01.Kvβ1 N16ALKSRAGEDRLLS35 ± 53-ap < 0.01.Kvβ1 G17S,E18G,D19NLKSRNSGNRLLSNIKvβ1 G17ALKSRNAEDRLLS10 ± 3Kvβ1 E18ALKSRNGADRLLS11 ± 3Kvβ1 D19ALKSRNGEARLLS9 ± 4Kvβ1 R20ALKSRNGEDALLS2000 ± 3003-bp < 0.001.Kvβ1 L21ALKSRNGEDRALS300 ± 53-bp < 0.001.Kvβ1 L22ALKSRNGEDRLAS10 ± 3Kvβ1 S23ALKSRNGEDRLLA35 ± 43-ap < 0.01.Kv1.1 wild-typeTLKASMRELGLL15 ± 2Kv1.1 T318AALKASMRELGLL100 ± 23-bp < 0.001.Kv1.1 L319ATAKASMRELGLL17 ± 3Kv1.1 S322ATLKAAMRELGLL2000 ± 4003-bp < 0.001.Kv1.1 M323ATLKASARELGLL45 ± 23-bp < 0.001.Kv1.1 R324ATLKASMAELGLLNIKv1.1 E325ATLKASMRALGLL100 ± 33-bp < 0.001.Kv1.1 L326ATLKASMREAGLL25 ± 33-ap < 0.01.Kv1.1 G327ATLKASMRELALL18 ± 2Kv1.1 L328ATLKASMRELGAL900 ± 53-bp < 0.001.Constrained dodecamers were assayed for their ability to inhibit the interaction between Kvβ1 and Kv1.1 (n= 3).

Voltage-activated potassium currents are vital for neuronal function and are carried by membrane channels composed of 4α- and 4β-subunits arranged as a hetero-octamer (31Trimmer J.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Some β-subunits, such as Kvβ1, can convert noninactivating “delayed rectifying” currents of certain α-subunits (e.g.Kv1.1) into rapidly inactivating currents (12Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In this study we used a random peptide library to investigate the interacting domains of Kv1.1 and Kvβ1. The N terminus of Kvβ1 (amino acids 2–31), when used as bait, bound peptides homologous to the S4-S5 loop of Kv1.1, whereas sequences related to Kvβ1 NH2 terminus were observed when the S4-S5 loop of Kv1.1 was used as bait. This correlates well with studies that have implicated these regions as the sites of interaction between the K+ channel and NH2-terminal inactivation domains (12Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 18Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 353: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we were able to restrict the interacting regions to small motifs, amino acids 12–23 in Kvβ1 and residues 317–325 of Kv1.1, which form core domains important for the interaction. In the motif identified in Kvβ1, Arg20 and Leu21 were represented in 55 and 77% of the sequences analyzed at day 5. 69% of the clones had a basic residue (KR) at position 20, suggesting that a positive charge at this position may be important for structure/function of the Kvβ1. In contrast, a strong preference for a hydrophobic residue (AILFWVPM) was seen at position 21 (80% of the clones had a hydrophobic residue). In a protein interaction assay the Kvβ1 mutations R20A and L21A had the largest effect on binding, causing a 200- and 30-fold decrease in affinity, respectively. The other residues had little or no effect, and this is perhaps indicative of their having a more structural role in presenting the key residues in a conformation to maximize the interaction rather than participating directly in Kv1.1 binding. A sequence comparison of Kvβ1, Kvβ1.2, and Kvβ1.3 indicates that the NH2 termini of these proteins are quite divergent (16Majumder K. DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Morales M.J. Castellino R.C. Crews A.L. Rasmusson R.L. Strauss H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6272-6277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the key residues identified by our study are not found in Kvβ1.2, Kvβ1.3, Kvβ2, or Kvβ3, which could explain the lower effectiveness of the Kvβ1.2 in inactivating Kv channels (12Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 30Leicher T. Roeper J. Weber K. Wang X. Pongs O. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Rettig et al. (12Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) have shown that the triple mutation G17S,E18G,D19N increased the inactivating ability of Kvβ1. In our study, this triple mutant was unable to inhibit the Kv1.1- Kvβ1 interaction even though this triplet was seen at early days of panning, suggesting that these amino acids play a role in the Kvβ1/Kv1.1 binding. One might speculate that this triplet is important for the structural integrity of the Kvβ1 interacting domain, and the conformational changes due to the mutation have less of an impact on the full-length sequence than the small constrained peptides used in this study. The results described here imply that the reported effects of this triple mutation are unlikely to be exerted purely at the level of the protein-protein interaction (12Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar); the increase in net positive charge in the mutant β-subunit may also change the response of this subunit to changes in membrane voltage. Our study also demonstrates that a minimal sequence motif of TLXXXMREL found in the Kv1.1 S4-S5 loop is important for the interaction of Kv1.1 and Kvβ1. Studies of Shaker K+ channel inactivation indicated that mutation of E395Q leads to a large decrease in the fast component of inactivation (18Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 353: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The comparable mutation in our study gave a 6-fold increase in IC50, suggesting that its effect on inactivation may be due to a decrease in affinity of the inactivating ball peptide for the S4-S5 loop. Other substitutions, which decreased Shaker channel inactivation (T388S/A, S392C/A), also reduced the affinity of our constrained mutant peptides; S322A resulted in a 133-fold increase in IC50, whereas T318A caused a more modest 6-fold increase. In agreement with the mutation data in Shaker, our data also suggests that Leu319 and Gly327 play an insignificant role in the interaction. However, one anomaly is the large effect of the R324A mutation in our hands. This residue was conserved even at day 2 and was found in 70% of day 5 clones. Surprisingly, mutation of this residue to glutamine in Shaker was without effect. This may indicate the increased sensitivity of our assay to changes in conformation of a small peptide. This study demonstrates that random peptide libraries are useful tools for the study of protein-protein interactions. Our results support and extend the literature indicating that the β1 NH2 terminus is likely to mediate its action by binding the S4-S5 loop of Kv1.1. Furthermore, we have identified key residues which are likely to participate in the protein-protein interactions required for β-subunit-mediated Kv channel inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2092616643,"Studies of antistasin, a potent factor Xa inhibitor with anticoagulant properties, were performed wherein the properties of the full-length antistasin polypeptide (ATS-119) were compared with the properties of forms of antistasin truncated at residue 116 (ATS-116) and residue 112 (ATS-112). ATS-119 was 40-fold more potent than ATS-112 in prolonging the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), whereas ATS-119 inhibited factor Xa 2.2-fold less avidly and about 5-fold more slowly than did ATS-112. The decreased reactivity of ATS-119 suggests that the carboxyl-terminal domain of ATS-119 stabilizes an ATS conformation with a reduced reactivity toward factor Xa. The observation that calcium ion increases the reactivity of ATS-119 but not that of ATS-112 suggests that calcium ion may disrupt interactions involving the carboxyl terminus of ATS-119. Interestingly, ATS-119 inhibited factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex 2–6-fold more potently and 2–3-fold faster than ATS-112. These differences in affinity and reactivity might well account for the greater effectiveness of ATS-119 in prolonging the APTT and suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domain of ATS-119 disrupts interactions involving phospholipid, factor Va, and prothrombin in the prothrombinase complex. The peptide RPKRKLIPRLS, corresponding to the carboxyl domain of ATS-119 prolonged the APTT and inhibited prothrombinase-catalyzed processing of prothrombin, but it failed to inhibit the catalytic activity of isolated factor Xa. Thus, this novel inhibitor appears to exert its inhibitory effects at a site removed from the active site of factor Xa.

Factor Xa (fXa),1 a serine protease that functions at the intersection of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway for blood coagulation, activates prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin in turn activates platelets and converts the soluble plasma protein fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin matrix of blood clots. The central role of fXa in blood coagulation suggests that fXa inhibitors might have therapeutic utility as anticoagulants. It is important to note, however, that fXa functions in the blood coagulation cascade in a complex with calcium ion, factor Va (fVa) and an appropriate phospholipid membrane, and that the catalytic activity toward prothrombin of this prothrombinase complex is several orders of magnitude greater than that of isolated fXa (1Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that certain inhibitors might exhibit different inhibitory potencies toward fXa in the prothrombinase complex and isolated fXa. Many natural inhibitors of fXa are known. In plasma, antithrombin III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor regulate blood coagulation by inhibiting fXa and other enzymes in the blood coagulation cascade (3Bauer K.A. Rosenberg R.D. Semin.

Other fXa inhibitors, such as tick anticoagulant peptide and antistasin (ATS) have been isolated from blood-sucking animals (5Waxman L. Smith D.E. Arcuri K.E. Vlasuk G.P.

Kinetic studies reveal that antistasin is a potent, slow, tight-binding inhibitor of fXa (7Dunwiddie C. Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Sardana M. Friedman P.A. Jacobs J.W. Simpson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16694-16699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only other protease inhibited by antistasin appears to be trypsin (IC50, 5 nm) (7Dunwiddie C. Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Sardana M. Friedman P.A. Jacobs J.W. Simpson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16694-16699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antistasin, a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, bears a structural resemblance to the fXa substrate prothrombin, and as expected, the inhibitor undergoes fXa mediated cleavage (at Arg-34) to form a stable covalently bound enzyme-inhibitor complex (7Dunwiddie C.

Intact antistasin had been successfully expressed in the insect baculovirus host (8Nutt E.M. Jain D. Lenny A.B. Schaffer L. Siegel P.K. Dunwiddie C.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The present study, wherein full-length and two truncated antistasins (from yeast and an African green monkey kidney cell line) are characterized, suggests that the carboxyl-terminal domain of antistasin, which has little influence on inhibitory potency toward isolated fXa, is important for the anticoagulant activity of antistasin. Additionally, a small peptide encompassing the carboxyl-terminal domain of antistasin that selectively inhibits fXa in the prothrombinase complex is identified. The chromogenic substrates Spectrozyme Xa (methoxycarbonyl-d-(cyclohexyl-Gly)-Arg-p-nitroanilide) and Chromozyme TH (tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide) were purchased from American Diagnostica Inc. and Sigma, respectively, and prepared as recommended.

Concentrations of recombinant truncated forms of ATS were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis and verified by titration with fXa. Small peptides were prepared by solid-phase synthesis (19Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem.

Identity and homogeneity were confirmed by quantitative amino acid analysis, high pressure liquid chromatography, and fast atom bombardment mass spectral analysis. This assay was performed using a Medical Laboratory Automation coagulation timer (Electra 900). A 10 μl aliquot of inhibitor or buffer was added to 100 μl of freshly prepared platelet-poor human plasma in a disposable cuvette (n = 2). The resulting sample was mixed with 100 μl of Actin reagent (Baxter Diagnostics Inc., McGaw Park, IL) and 100 μl of 20 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C according to the standard protocol provided by the reagent manufacturer. Concentrations of inhibitors that doubled clotting times (2× APTT) are reported as the final concentration in the assay mixture. Phospholipid was prepared by a modification of the procedure of Barenholz et al. (20Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D.

Synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-phosphocholine (PC) and 1,2-dioleoyl phosphoserine (PS) (purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) were mixed (molar ratio, PC:PS = 75:25) and evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream. The resulting residue was suspended in HBS buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at a phospholipid concentration of 10 mg/ml. The solution was sonicated (Braun-Sonic 2000 or Cole Palmer Ultrasonic Homogenizer) in an ice bath for 6–8 cycles of 1.5 min of sonication spaced by 1-min intervals under a continuous nitrogen stream. The sonicated solution was centrifuged (Beckman XL-90 Ultracentrifuge) in Beckman Ultra-Clear tubes for 3–4 h at 4 °C in an SW 50.1 swinging-bucket rotor, at 190,000 × g(40,000 rpm). The upper 50% of the final solution was collected, and stored under nitrogen at 4 °C. A phosphate assay (21Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol.

Prothrombin was reacted with fXa (0.1 pm-2 nm), fVa (5 nm), and/or phospholipid vesicle (5 μm) with calcium chloride (2 mm) in HBS buffer in a PEG-20,000 precoated 96-well microtiter plate for 0.5–2 h at room temperature, after which time, processing was quenched by addition of a solution containing 25 mm EDTA and 100 nm tick anticoagulant peptide. The concentration of the active thrombin produced was then determined from the rate of hydrolysis of S2238 (final concentration, 50 μm). Values of k cat/K m were derived from the dependence of the rate of thrombin activation on concentrations of the prothrombin and fXa. Assay solutions contained recombinant ATS (final concentration, 1 nm), calcium chloride (2 mm) and IEGR-AMC (40 μm,K m = 750 μm) in HBSP buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% PEG-8000 in a PEG-20,000 precoated 96-well fluorogenic microtiter plate (Dynatech MicroFluor) at room temperature. A solution of fXa (final 0.2 nm) containing 0.02 nm recombinant hirudin was mixed with the assay solution, and the hydrolysis rate was measured directly from the rate of increase of fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence plate reader (FluroStar, SLT Labinstruments, Salzburg, Austria). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 390 and 460 nm, respectively. The pseudo-first order rate constant for the inhibition of fXa by ATS was determined from the first order approach of the velocity to its final inhibited velocity, using Equation 1 as described previously (22Williams J.W.

Because ATS is a competitive inhibitor of fXa (7Dunwiddie C. Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Sardana M. Friedman P.A. Jacobs J.W. Simpson E. J. Biol.

For reactions in the absence of inhibitors, a diluted solution of fXa (final concentration, 0.02–0.05 pm) was used. The rate of thrombin activation appeared to be constant using 0.02–2 pm fXa. At various times (up to 4 h), a 20-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed and quenched with 105 μl of 10 mm EDTA in Tris-buffered saline with PEG-8000. The amount of thrombin generated was determined by an activity assay using 50 μl of S2238 (250 μm in the quenching buffer). A fit of the data to Equation 4 yielded the pseudo-first order rate constant for reaction of ATS with fXa, where V i,V s, and P t represent the initial and final rate of thrombin generation and amount of thrombin generated at time t, respectively. Pt=Vs×t+Vi−Vs1−exp−kobs×t/kobs(Eq. 4) The inhibition constant (K i) and the second order association rate constant (k on)were determined using Equations 2 and 3, respectively. fXa, 0.5 nm, was preincubated with a small ATS peptide (final concentration, 0–400 μm) at room temperature in a reaction buffer (Tris-buffered saline with PEG-8000) containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% PEG-8000 in a PEG-20,000 precoated microtiter plate at room temperature for 30 min. Spectrozyme Xa (final concentration, 100 μm) was then added, and the velocity of substrate hydrolysis was determined from the time-dependent increase in absorbance at 405 nm. This assay was performed using a fibrinometer (BBL FibroSystem) at 37 °C. A solution of 80 μl of human plasma deficient in fX and fVII was mixed with 80 μl of rabbit brain cephalin (Sigma), 40 μl of fXa (final concentration, 10 nm), and a small ATS peptide (0–500 μm). The mixture was equilibrated at 37 °C, and 100 μl of 100 mm CaCl2 was added to initiate measurement of the clotting time. Tris-buffered saline containing 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl was used to dilute peptides and to obtain clotting time of the control without peptides. Antistasin peptides (final concentration, 0–400 μm) were preincubated with 1 pm fXa, 0.1–5 nm fVa, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.5–5 μm PL in HBS buffer at 37 °C for 30 min, and prothrombin (final concentration, 20 nm) was then added. At various times, aliquots of the reaction mixture were quenched with EDTA (final concentration, 25 mm). The concentration of thrombin in the quenched reaction mixture was determined using the chromogenic thrombin substrate S2238 (9Lottenberg R. Christensen U. Jackson C.M. Coleman P.L.

Full-length antistasin (ATS-119), an antistasin derivative truncated at residue 116 (ATS-116), and an antistasin derivative truncated at residue 112 (ATS-112) were purified from secreted cell-free products of insect, yeast, and African green monkey kidney cells, respectively, in which recombinant antistasin was expressed (8Nutt E.M.

The molecular weights of the ATS polypeptides and/or the amino acid sequences of carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptides established the identity of each form of ATS (Table I). Data shown in Table I indicate the substantial effect of carboxyl-terminal truncation on the potency of the truncated forms of ATS in prolonging the APTT coagulation time. Surprisingly, the difference in potency of the three truncated forms of ATS was not reflected in their inhibitory activity toward isolated fXa. In fact, the most truncated antistasin (ATS-112), which, relative to the full-length antistasin (ATS-119), exhibited a 40-fold reduction in potency in prolonging the APTT, bound fXa 2.2-fold more tightly and reacted with fXa 5-fold faster than did ATS-119 (Fig. 2 and Table II). Interestingly, calcium ion increased the affinity of all three forms of ATS for fXa by about 5-fold (Fig. 2and Table II). Additionally, calcium ion increased the value of the rate constant for formation of the fXa-ATS inhibitory complex by about 3-fold for full-length ATS-119, whereas little or no change in the rate constant was observed with ATS-112.Table IProperties of truncated forms of antistasinATS variantsCarboxyl terminusMolecular weight2× APTT1-aValues are the final concentrations for doubling APTT clotting times using human platelet poor plasma.CalculatedExperimentalnm109 119ATS-119-R-P-K-R-K-L-I-P-R-L-S-COOH13,328.421-bCalculated value is based on primary structure of recombinant ATS 1–119 residues, with all cysteine residues oxidized to disulfide bonds and the amino terminus as pyroglutamate residue.13,327.8 ± 0.56ATS-116-R-P-K-R-K-L-I-P-COOH13,020.011-cCalculated value is based on primary structure of recombinant ATS 1–116 residues, with all cysteine residues oxidized to disulfide bonds, methionine residues oxidized to methionine sulfoxide, and the N terminus as pyroglutamate residue (9).13,019.5 ± 0.619ATS-112-R-P-K-R-COOH12,520.411-dCalculated value is based on primary structure of ATS 1–112 residues, with all cysteine residues oxidized to disulfide bonds and the amino terminus as pyroglutamate residue.12,520.1 ± 1.12401-a Values are the final concentrations for doubling APTT clotting times using human platelet poor plasma.1-b Calculated value is based on primary structure of recombinant ATS 1–119 residues, with all cysteine residues oxidized to disulfide bonds and the amino terminus as pyroglutamate residue.1-c Calculated value is based on primary structure of recombinant ATS 1–116 residues, with all cysteine residues oxidized to disulfide bonds, methionine residues oxidized to methionine sulfoxide, and the N terminus as pyroglutamate residue (9Lottenberg R.

To explore the source of the 40-fold enhanced potency of ATS-119 in prolonging the APTT, we studied the effect of truncated forms of ATS on fXa-catalyzed prothrombin processing in the presence of the other components of the prothrombinase complex. Table III illustrates the well documented increase in catalytic efficiency of fXa upon assembly of the prothrombinase complex. Thus, fVa/Ca and Ca/PL vesicles increasedk cat/K m 150- and 2900-fold, respectively. PL appears to selectively effect K m(K m = 0.042 μm at [PL] = 5 μm) for the interaction of fXa with prothrombin, because the value of k cat (0.01 s−1) in the presence of excess PL is similar to the value reported for fXa acting alone (2Rosing J.

The values of 0.19 ± 0.02 μm forK m and 170 ± 20 s−1 fork cat for the fully assembled human prothrombinase complex indicate a 107-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) relative to that of isolated fXa.

As shown in Fig. 3, full-length ATS-119 exhibits greater inhibitory potency and faster association with fXa in the prothrombinase complex than does either truncated ATS-112 or ATS-116. Comparison of the inhibition constants determined for inhibition of the activity of isolated fXa plus calcium ion (Table II) with those for inhibition of fXa in the prothrombinase complex (Table IV) indicates that (depending on the fVa and PL concentration) full-length ATS-119 is 9–18-fold more potent in inhibiting prothrombinase than in inhibiting fXa/Ca. The truncated forms ATS-116 and ATS-112 show reduced selectivity toward prothrombinase versus fXa of 6–9-fold and 1.3–1.4-fold, respectively (Tables II and IV). ATS-119 inhibits prothrombinase 2–6-fold more potently and binds to prothrombinase 2–3-fold faster than does truncated ATS-112 (Table IV).Table IVEffect of phospholipid and fXa on rate and equilibrium constants for inhibition by truncated forms of antistasin prothrombinase-catalyzed processing of prothrombin1 μm PL5 μm PLK ik onK ik onpmμm−1s−1pmμm−1s−10.5 nm fVa ATS-1198 ± 24.5 ± 1.513 ± 42.5 ± 0.5 ATS-11617 ± 42.8 ± 0.514 ± 51.7 ± 0.3 ATS-11233 ± 82.2 ± 0.720 ± 101.4 ± 0.25 nm fVa ATS-1196 ± 220 ± 29 ± 27.8 ± 1 ATS-11612 ± 314 ± 213 ± 34.8 ± 1 ATS-11239 ± 96.5 ± 233 ± 103.5 ± 1Equilibrium constants were determined in solutions composed of 0.1–2 pm fXa, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 nmprothrombin in HBSP buffer containing 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% PEG-8000 at room temperature. Open table in a new tab Equilibrium constants were determined in solutions composed of 0.1–2 pm fXa, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 nmprothrombin in HBSP buffer containing 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% PEG-8000 at room temperature. It is interesting to note that PL selectively increases the rate of inhibition of fXa/Ca by ATS-119 so as to alter the relative rate of inhibition of fXa/Ca by ATS-119 and ATS-112 from 0.76 in the absence of PL to 2.5 in the presence of 1 μm PL (Fig. 4). Addition of fVa to fXa/Ca/PL leads to a further enhancement in the rate of inhibition by both ATS-119 and ATS-112 (Table IV). Interactions involving the carboxyl-terminal domain of ATS-119 and components of the prothrombinase complex may account for the enhanced reactivity of ATS-119 with prothrombinase and the enhanced anticoagulant activity of ATS-119 in the APTT assay. As shown by the data in Table IV, the enhanced interaction of ATS-119 with prothrombinase appears to depend upon the concentrations of fVa and PL used to form the prothrombinase complex. Increasing the fVa concentration from 0.5 nm to 5 nm increases the rate constant for inhibition by 3–5-fold, whereas increasing the PL concentration from 1 μm to 5 μm decreases the rate constant by 1.6–2.9-fold. The prothrombin concentration dependence of the inhibitory potency of antistasin was characterized in an attempt to elucidate the nature of the interaction between antistasin and human prothrombin. The physiological concentration of prothrombin (1.4 μm) is approximately 7-fold greater than the K m determined for prothrombin processing by prothrombinase (Table III). For a case of simple competitive antagonism, the apparent dissociation constants for inhibitors should be reduced by a factor of 1 + [S]/K m, where [S] represents the substrate concentration. Thus, at 0.2 and 1 μm prothrombin, we should observe 2-fold and 6-fold decreases, respectively, in the apparent value of K ifor inhibition of prothrombinase by antistasin. In the presence of 5 μm PL and 5 nm fVa, 8- and 29-fold reductions of inhibitory potency were actually observed for ATS-119 (Table V). Similar effects were observed for ATS-116 (8.5- and 42-fold, respectively) and ATS-112 (19- and 52-fold, respectively). With a lower concentration of PL (1 μm), prothrombin concentration-dependent decreases of inhibitory potency are somewhat less pronounced (Table V).Table VThe effect of prothrombin on the inhibition of prothrombinase by truncated forms of antistasin[II]K i1 μm PL5 μmPLATS-119ATS-116ATS-112ATS-119ATS-116ATS-112pm20 nm6 ± 212 ± 339 ± 99 ± 213 ± 333 ± 10200 nm26 ± 473 ± 10210 ± 2076 ± 10110 ± 20640 ± 501000 nm65 ± 10190 ± 20780 ± 80260 ± 20540 ± 401700 ± 300Equilibrium constants were determined in solutions comprised of 0.1–2 pm Factor Xa, 5 nm Factor Va, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.5–10 nm antistasin in HBSP buffer containing 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% PEG-8000 at room temperature. Open table in a new tab Equilibrium constants were determined in solutions comprised of 0.1–2 pm Factor Xa, 5 nm Factor Va, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.5–10 nm antistasin in HBSP buffer containing 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% PEG-8000 at room temperature. To characterize further the anticoagulant effect of the carboxyl terminus of antistasin, the peptides ATS(113–119), ATS(109–119), and ATS(109–112) composed of the indicated residues in antistasin were studied. Additionally, the peptide ATS(119–109), a peptide with the reversed order sequence of ATS(109–119), was studied. ATS(109–119) doubled the APTT and fXa-induced clotting time at concentrations of 74 and 120 μm. The shorter peptide ATS(113–119) containing residues truncated in ATS-112, the highly cationic tetrapeptide ATS(109–112), and ATS(119–109), the inverted peptide, did not prolong the clotting time either in the APTT assay at 400 μm or the fXa clotting assay at 500 μm. None of the four peptides inhibited fXa-mediated hydrolysis of a small substrate at the highest peptide concentration studied (400 μm). ATS(109–119) did, however, inhibit the activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex (Table VI). As indicated by the data in Table VI, the inhibitory potency of ATS(109–119) appears to be a complex function of the concentration of fVa and PL wherein maximum inhibition (IC50 ∼ 27 μm) is observed at approximately 0.1 nm fVa and 0.5 μm PL. Although ATS(109–119) did not inhibit fXa/Ca in the absence of both fVa and PL (Table VI), inhibition of fXa/Ca-catalyzed prothrombin processing by ATS(109–119) does not require assembly of the entire prothrombin complex. As documented in Table VI, ATS(109–119) inhibits the catalytic activity of fXa/Ca in the presence of fVa in the absence of PL and in the presence of PL in the absence of fVa. In contrast to ATS(109–119), none of the other peptides inhibit activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase at the highest concentration tested (400 μm). Finally, 200 μm ATS(109–119) does not inhibit thrombin-catalyzed fibrinopeptide A release from fibrinogen (hence K i > 1 mm), although thrombin slowly (k cat/K m = 1.8 × 103m−1 s−1) cleaves ATS(109–119) at the Arg-117-Leu-118 peptide bond in ATS(109–119).Table VIInhibition of prothrombinase-catalyzed prothrombin processing by ATS(109–119)Factor VaIC50 [PL]0 μm0.5 μm1 μm2 μm5 μmμm0 nm>1000330480>1000>10000.1 nm3102741400>10000.5 nm3003550>1000>10005 nm>1000100370>1000>1000IC50 values were determined with 0.5–10 pm fXa, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 nm prothrombin in HBS buffer containing 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl at room temperature.

The ability of 6 nm ATS-119 to prolong the APTT 2-fold is impressive when one considers that 19 nm hirudin is required to double the APTT with human plasma 2S.-S. Mao, unpublished observations. and that theK i for inhibition of prothrombinase by ATS-119 is approximately 6 pm, whereas the K i for inhibition of thrombin by hirudin is 22 fM (25Stone S.R. Braun P.J. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The greater potency of ATS-119 in prolonging the APTT despite the weaker interactions with its target may reflect the fact that ATS-119 acts earlier in the blood coagulation cascade than does hirudin. The observation that truncated ATS-112 reacts with isolated fXa faster than does full-length ATS-119 suggests the possibility that the cationic carboxyl-terminal domain of ATS-119 may be stabilizing an antistasin conformation that is unfavorable for binding to fXa. The observation that calcium ion increases the rate of reaction of full-length ATS-119 with isolated fXa but not that of truncated ATS-112 is consistent with the possibility that the cationic carboxyl-terminal domain of ATS-119 may be interacting with certain internal anionic carboxylate groups. Complexation of such carboxylate groups with calcium ion could destabilize their putative interaction with the cationic carboxyl-terminal domain of antistasin and thereby favor an antistasin conformation that reacts more rapidly with isolated fXa. The 5-fold increase in the inhibitory potency toward isolated fXa exhibited by both the full-length and truncated forms of antistasin in the presence of calcium ion may well reflect an effect of calcium ion on the conformation of fXa. The observation that ATS-119 inhibits prothrombinase more potently and more rapidly than does ATS-112 in a phospholipid and fVa-dependent fashion is consistent with the view that the carboxyl-terminal domain of antistasin interacts with these components of the prothrombinase complex. Thus, in addition to interacting with the active site of fXa, ATS-119 may be disrupting interactions involving fXa, fVa, PL, and prothrombin in the prothrombinase complex. Interestingly, addition of PL and fVa to fXa/Ca increases both affinity for full-length ATS and prothrombin processing activity, albeit fVa and PL enhance prothrombin processing activity to a much greater extent than affinity for ATS. It is tempting to speculate that interactions of ATS with prothrombinase may resemble to some extent those of prothrombin. With regard to this possibility, it is interesting to note that a sequence homology between the carboxyl-terminal domain of ATS-119 and residues 52–62 of prothrombin (Fig. 5) may provide a structural basis for some of the prothrombin-like interactions of ATS. The observation that the antagonist effect of prothrombin on antistasin inhibition was greater than that expected for a competitive antagonist suggests the possibility that at high concentrations, more than one molecule of prothrombin can interact with each prothrombinase complex. Because each prothrombinase complex contains several molecules of PL, the excess prothrombin may bind to and thereby reduce the fraction of PL that is free to interact with ATS in the prothrombinase complex. Further studies of the complex equilibria involving ATS, prothrombin, and the components of the prothrombin complex will be required to properly characterize the antagonism of ATS by prothrombin. The observation that the peptide ATS(109–119), RPKRKLIPRLS, inhibits prothrombinase but not isolated fXa supports the contention that the carboxyl-terminal domain of antistasin does not interact with the active site of fXa, but rather antagonizes interactions between fXa and its cofactors that give rise to the 107-fold increase in catalytic efficiency of fXa in prothrombinase. The observation that the peptide ATS(119–109) with the inverted sequence of ATS(109–119) does not inhibit prothrombinase or prolong clotting times makes it difficult to ascribe the inhibition of prothrombinase observed with ATS(109–119) to nonspecific charge-charge interactions. Thus, PRKRKLIPRLS exemplifies a new class of synthetic anticoagulants that selectively inhibits the catalytic activity of prothrombinase but not that of fXa. We thank Drs. Dale Lehman and Jim Cook for providing r-hirudin, Drs. Rodney Bednar, Steve Carroll, and Steve Gardell for helpful discussion, and Carole Hannan for preparation of the manuscript."
