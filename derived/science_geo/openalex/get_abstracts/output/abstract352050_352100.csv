https://openalex.org/W2135003112,"About a quarter of the nitrogen added to the biosphere is exported from rivers to the ocean or inland basins, indicating substantial sinks for nitrogen must exist in the landscape. Data from nitrogen stable isotope tracer experiments across 72 streams suggests that the total uptake of nitrate is related to ecosystem photosynthesis, and that denitrification is related to ecosystem respiration. A stream network model demonstrates that excess nitrate in streams elicits a disproportionate increase in the fraction of nitrate that is exported to receiving waters and reduces the relative role of small versus large streams as nitrate sinks. Anthropogenic addition of bioavailable nitrogen to the biosphere is increasing1,2 and terrestrial ecosystems are becoming increasingly nitrogen-saturated3, causing more bioavailable nitrogen to enter groundwater and surface waters4,5,6. Large-scale nitrogen budgets show that an average of about 20–25 per cent of the nitrogen added to the biosphere is exported from rivers to the ocean or inland basins7,8, indicating that substantial sinks for nitrogen must exist in the landscape9. Streams and rivers may themselves be important sinks for bioavailable nitrogen owing to their hydrological connections with terrestrial systems, high rates of biological activity, and streambed sediment environments that favour microbial denitrification6,10,11. Here we present data from nitrogen stable isotope tracer experiments across 72 streams and 8 regions representing several biomes. We show that total biotic uptake and denitrification of nitrate increase with stream nitrate concentration, but that the efficiency of biotic uptake and denitrification declines as concentration increases, reducing the proportion of in-stream nitrate that is removed from transport. Our data suggest that the total uptake of nitrate is related to ecosystem photosynthesis and that denitrification is related to ecosystem respiration. In addition, we use a stream network model to demonstrate that excess nitrate in streams elicits a disproportionate increase in the fraction of nitrate that is exported to receiving waters and reduces the relative role of small versus large streams as nitrate sinks."

https://openalex.org/W2125573161,"The autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES, 'Job's syndrome') is characterized by recurrent and often severe pulmonary infections, pneumatoceles, eczema, staphylococcal abscesses, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and abnormalities of bone and connective tissue. Mutations presumed to underlie HIES have recently been identified in stat3, the gene encoding STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) (refs 3, 4). Although impaired production of interferon-gamma and tumour-necrosis factor by T cells, diminished memory T-cell populations, decreased delayed-type-hypersensitivity responses and decreased in vitro lymphoproliferation in response to specific antigens have variably been described, specific immunological abnormalities that can explain the unique susceptibility to particular infections seen in HIES have not yet been defined. Here we show that interleukin (IL)-17 production by T cells is absent in HIES individuals. We observed that ex vivo T cells from subjects with HIES failed to produce IL-17, but not IL-2, tumour-necrosis factor or interferon-gamma, on mitogenic stimulation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B or on antigenic stimulation with Candida albicans or streptokinase. Purified naive T cells were unable to differentiate into IL-17-producing (T(H)17) T helper cells in vitro and had lower expression of retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gammat, which is consistent with a crucial role for STAT3 signalling in the generation of T(H)17 cells. T(H)17 cells have emerged as an important subset of helper T cells that are believed to be critical in the clearance of fungal and extracellular bacterial infections. Thus, our data suggest that the inability to produce T(H)17 cells is a mechanism underlying the susceptibility to the recurrent infections commonly seen in HIES."
https://openalex.org/W2029969982,"The Sir2 family member SIRT6 is an NAD-dependent, histone H3 lysine 9 deacetylase enzyme that modulates telomeric chromatin and is required for stable association of WRN, the factor that is mutated in Werner Syndrome. The Sir2 deacetylase regulates chromatin silencing and lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae1,2. In mice, deficiency for the Sir2 family member SIRT6 leads to a shortened lifespan and a premature ageing-like phenotype3. However, the molecular mechanisms of SIRT6 function are unclear. SIRT6 is a chromatin-associated protein3, but no enzymatic activity of SIRT6 at chromatin has yet been detected, and the identity of physiological SIRT6 substrates is unknown. Here we show that the human SIRT6 protein is an NAD+-dependent, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) deacetylase that modulates telomeric chromatin. SIRT6 associates specifically with telomeres, and SIRT6 depletion leads to telomere dysfunction with end-to-end chromosomal fusions and premature cellular senescence. Moreover, SIRT6-depleted cells exhibit abnormal telomere structures that resemble defects observed in Werner syndrome, a premature ageing disorder4,5. At telomeric chromatin, SIRT6 deacetylates H3K9 and is required for the stable association of WRN, the factor that is mutated in Werner syndrome4,5. We propose that SIRT6 contributes to the propagation of a specialized chromatin state at mammalian telomeres, which in turn is required for proper telomere metabolism and function. Our findings constitute the first identification of a physiological enzymatic activity of SIRT6, and link chromatin regulation by SIRT6 to telomere maintenance and a human premature ageing syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W1964247113,"The Gulf Stream is a warm Atlantic current that transports heat northward, keeping Western Europe significantly warmer than North America in winter. It is known to influence short-term weather phenomena such as surface winds and cyclone formation, but its effects on longer-term climate and at higher levels in the atmosphere are poorly understood. Now a combination of weather analyses, satellite data and an atmospheric general circulation model reveals that the Gulf Stream's influence is felt well above the near-surface portion of the atmosphere. The current anchors a tall wall of atmospheric upward motion that penetrates into the upper troposphere and supports deep raining clouds. This provides a pathway by which the Gulf Stream can affect local climate, and possibly climate in remote regions via an effect on planetary wave propagation. The cover graphic represents surface current speeds in blue-white colours (white is the fastest) and upward wind velocities in yellow-red colours (red for stronger winds), along with land-surface topography in eastern North America. The Gulf Stream's influence on the atmosphere is examined using a combination of operational weather analyses and satellite observations. The results indicate that the Gulf Stream anchors a rain band in which upward motion of air penetrates deep into the upper troposphere, well above the near-surface portion of the atmosphere. These mechanisms provide a pathway by which the Gulf Stream can affect local climate, and possibly also climate in remote regions. The Gulf Stream transports large amounts of heat from the tropics to middle and high latitudes, and thereby affects weather phenomena such as cyclogenesis1,2 and low cloud formation3. But its climatic influence, on monthly and longer timescales, remains poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear how the warm current affects the free atmosphere above the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Here we consider the Gulf Stream’s influence on the troposphere, using a combination of operational weather analyses, satellite observations and an atmospheric general circulation model4. Our results reveal that the Gulf Stream affects the entire troposphere. In the marine boundary layer, atmospheric pressure adjustments to sharp sea surface temperature gradients lead to surface wind convergence, which anchors a narrow band of precipitation along the Gulf Stream. In this rain band, upward motion and cloud formation extend into the upper troposphere, as corroborated by the frequent occurrence of very low cloud-top temperatures. These mechanisms provide a pathway by which the Gulf Stream can affect the atmosphere locally, and possibly also in remote regions by forcing planetary waves5,6. The identification of this pathway may have implications for our understanding of the processes involved in climate change, because the Gulf Stream is the upper limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which has varied in strength in the past7 and is predicted to weaken in response to human-induced global warming in the future8."

https://openalex.org/W2056309362,"Previously, we demonstrated JNK plays a central role in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (Gunawan, B. K., Liu, Z. X., Han, D., Hanawa, N., Gaarde, W. A., and Kaplowitz, N. (2006) Gastroenterology 131, 165-178). In this study, we examine the mechanism involved in activating JNK and explore the downstream targets of JNK important in promoting APAP-induced liver injury in vivo. JNK inhibitor (SP600125) was observed to significantly protect against APAP-induced liver injury. Increased mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species were implicated in APAP-induced JNK activation based on the following: 1) mitochondrial GSH depletion (maximal at 2 h) caused increased H2O2 release from mitochondria, which preceded JNK activation (maximal at 4 h); 2) treatment of isolated hepatocytes with H2O2 or inhibitors (e.g. antimycin) that cause increased H2O2 release from mitochondria-activated JNK. An important downstream target of JNK following activation was mitochondria based on the following: 1) JNK translocated to mitochondria following activation; 2) JNK inhibitor treatment partially protected against a decline in mitochondria respiration caused by APAP treatment; and 3) addition of purified active JNK to mitochondria isolated from mice treated with APAP plus JNK inhibitor (mitochondria with severe GSH depletion, covalent binding) directly inhibited respiration. Cyclosporin A blocked the inhibitory effect of JNK on mitochondria respiration, suggesting JNK was directly inducing mitochondrial permeability transition in isolated mitochondria from mice treated with APAP plus JNK inhibitor. Addition of JNK to mitochondria isolated from control mice did not affect respiration. Our results suggests that APAP-induced liver injury involves JNK activation, due to increased reactive oxygen species generated by GSH-depleted mitochondria, and translocation of activated JNK to mitochondria where JNK induces mitochondrial permeability transition and inhibits mitochondria bioenergetics."

https://openalex.org/W2008526580,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a glutamine-encoding repeat in ataxin 1 (ATXN1). In all known polyglutamine diseases, the glutamine expansion confers toxic functions onto the protein; however, the mechanism by which this occurs remains enigmatic, in light of the fact that the mutant protein apparently maintains interactions with its usual partners. Here we show that the expanded polyglutamine tract differentially affects the function of the host protein in the context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine expansion in ATXN1 favours the formation of a particular protein complex containing RBM17, contributing to SCA1 neuropathology by means of a gain-of-function mechanism. Concomitantly, polyglutamine expansion attenuates the formation and function of another protein complex containing ATXN1 and capicua, contributing to SCA1 through a partial loss-of-function mechanism. This model provides mechanistic insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as well as other polyglutamine diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2067013073,"Introduction Ghrelin and cannabinoids stimulate appetite, this effect possibly being mediated by the activation of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key enzyme in appetite and metabolism regulation. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) antagonist rimonabant can block the orexigenic effect of ghrelin. In this study, we have elucidated the mechanism of the putative ghrelin-cannabinoid interaction. Methods The effects of ghrelin and CB1 antagonist rimonabant in wild-type mice, and the effect of ghrelin in CB1-knockout animals, were studied on food intake, hypothalamic AMPK activity and endogenous cannabinoid content. In patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments the effect of ghrelin was assessed on the synaptic inputs in parvocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, with or without the pre-administration of a CB1 antagonist or of cannabinoid synthesis inhibitors. Results and Conclusions Ghrelin did not induce an orexigenic effect in CB1-knockout mice. Correspondingly, both the genetic lack of CB1 and the pharmacological blockade of CB1 inhibited the effect of ghrelin on AMPK activity. Ghrelin increased the endocannabinoid content of the hypothalamus in wild-type mice and this effect was abolished by rimonabant pre-treatment, while no effect was observed in CB1-KO animals. Electrophysiology studies showed that ghrelin can inhibit the excitatory inputs on the parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, and that this effect is abolished by administration of a CB1 antagonist or an inhibitor of the DAG lipase, the enzyme responsible for 2-AG synthesis. The effect is also lost in the presence of BAPTA, an intracellular calcium chelator, which inhibits endocannabinoid synthesis in the recorded parvocellular neuron and therefore blocks the retrograde signaling exerted by endocannabinoids. In summary, an intact cannabinoid signaling pathway is necessary for the stimulatory effects of ghrelin on AMPK activity and food intake, and for the inhibitory effect of ghrelin on paraventricular neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2064866585,"Hepatic steatosis is often associated with insulin resistance and obesity and can lead to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. In this study, we have demonstrated that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), two enzymes critical for lipolysis in adipose tissues, also contribute to lipolysis in the liver and can mobilize hepatic triglycerides in vivo and in vitro. Adenoviral overexpression of HSL and/or ATGL reduced liver triglycerides by 40-60% in both ob/ob mice and mice with high fat diet-induced obesity. However, these enzymes did not affect fasting plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels or triglyceride and apolipoprotein B secretion rates. Plasma 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were increased 3-5 days after infection in both HSL- and ATGL-overexpressing male mice, suggesting an increase in beta-oxidation. Expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport and synthesis, lipid storage, and mitochondrial bioenergetics was unchanged. Mechanistic studies in oleate-supplemented McA-RH7777 cells with adenoviral overexpression of HSL or ATGL showed that reduced cellular triglycerides could be attributed to increases in beta-oxidation as well as direct release of free fatty acids into the medium. In summary, hepatic overexpression of HSL or ATGL can promote fatty acid oxidation, stimulate direct release of free fatty acid, and ameliorate hepatic steatosis. This study suggests a direct functional role for both HSL and ATGL in hepatic lipid homeostasis and identifies these enzymes as potential therapeutic targets for ameliorating hepatic steatosis associated with insulin resistance and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2042712910,"In this work, we present studies of the covalent structure of human IgG2 molecules. Detailed analysis showed that recombinant human IgG2 monoclonal antibody could be partially resolved into structurally distinct forms caused by multiple disulfide bond structures. In addition to the presently accepted structure for the human IgG2 subclass, we also found major structures that differ from those documented in the current literature. These novel structural isoforms are defined by the light chain constant domain (C(L)) and the heavy chain C(H)1 domain covalently linked via disulfide bonds to the hinge region of the molecule. Our results demonstrate the presence of three main types of structures within the human IgG2 subclass, and we have named these structures IgG2-A, -B, and -A/B. IgG2-A is the known classic structure for the IgG2 subclass defined by structurally independent Fab domains and hinge region. IgG2-B is a structure defined by a symmetrical arrangement of a (C(H)1-C(L)-hinge)(2) complex with both Fab regions covalently linked to the hinge. IgG2-A/B represents an intermediate form, defined by an asymmetrical arrangement involving one Fab arm covalently linked to the hinge through disulfide bonds. The newly discovered structural isoforms are present in native human IgG2 antibodies isolated from myeloma plasma and from normal serum. Furthermore, the isoforms are present in native human IgG2 with either kappa or lambda light chains, although the ratios differ between the light chain classes. These findings indicate that disulfide structural heterogeneity is a naturally occurring feature of antibodies belonging to the human IgG2 subclass."
https://openalex.org/W2069746308,"The Myc oncoprotein is a transcription factor involved in a variety of human cancers. Overexpression of Myc is associated with malignant transformation. In normal cells, Myc is induced by mitotic signals, and in turn, it regulates the expression of downstream target genes. Although diverse roles of Myc have been predicted from many previous studies, detailed functions of Myc targets are still unclear. By combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and promoter microarrays, we identified a total of 1469 Myc direct target genes, the majority of which are novel, in HeLa cells and human primary fibroblasts. We observed dramatic changes of Myc occupancy at its target promoters in foreskin fibroblasts in response to serum stimulation. Among the targets of Myc, 107 were nuclear encoded genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Genes with important roles in mitochondrial replication and biogenesis, such as POLG, POLG2, and NRF1 were identified as direct targets of Myc, confirming a direct role for Myc in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. Analysis of target promoter sequences revealed a strong preference for Myc occupancy at promoters containing one of several described consensus sequences, CACGTG, in vivo. This study thus sheds light on the transcriptional regulatory networks mediated by Myc in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2120226284,"Positive relationships between species diversity and productivity have been reported for a number of ecosystems. Theoretical and experimental studies have attempted to determine the mechanisms that generate this pattern over short timescales, but little attention has been given to the problem of understanding how diversity and productivity are linked over evolutionary timescales. Here, we investigate the role of dispersal in determining both diversity and productivity over evolutionary timescales, using experimental metacommunities of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens assembled by divergent natural selection. We show that both regional diversity and productivity peak at an intermediate dispersal rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that these two patterns are linked: selection at intermediate rates of dispersal leads to high niche differentiation between genotypes, allowing greater coverage of the heterogeneous environment and a higher regional productivity. We argue that processes that operate over both ecological and evolutionary timescales should be jointly considered when attempting to understand the emergence of ecosystem-level properties such as diversity-function relationships."

To understand the mechanism of this antifungal activity, the effect of NaD1 on Fov fungal membranes and the location of NaD1 in treated hyphae was examined using various fluorescence techniques. NaD1 permeabilized fungal plasma membranes via the formation of an aperture with an internal diameter of between 14 and 22Å. NaD1 bound to the cell walls of all treated hyphae and entered several hyphae, resulting in granulation of the cytoplasm and cell death. These results suggest that the activity of antifungal plant defensins may not be restricted to the hyphal membrane and that they enter cells and affect intracellular targets.

Plants produce a number of cationic peptides for protection against infection by potential microbial pathogens. These include defensins, which are one of the largest families of antimicrobial peptides found in plants. They are particularly abundant in seeds but have also been described in leaves, pods, tubers, fruit, and floral tissues (1Lay F.T. Anderson M.A. Curr. Protein Pept.

Plant defensins are small (45–54 amino acids), basic proteins with 4–5 disulfide bonds (3Janssen B.J. Schirra H.J. Lay F.T. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8214-8222Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). They share structural and functional similarities with defensins from insects (4Bulet P. Stocklin R. Protein Pept.

Plant defensins, even those with similar activities, share little sequence identity and may act via differing mechanisms. So far, only a limited number of seed defensins have been studied in detail. Defensins from radish (RsAFP2) and dahlia (DmAMP1) interact with specific sphingolipids on fungal plasma membranes and require the presence of these lipids for their antifungal activity. They permeabilize the fungal membrane and induce Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux, which disrupts the Ca2+ gradient essential for fungal tip growth (9Thevissen K. Cammue B.P. Lemaire K. Winderickx J.

A number of models have been suggested, including the barrel-stave pore, toroidal pore, and carpet models (for review, see Ref. 13Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides were initially thought to act solely at the plasma membrane, although some exert their cytotoxic effects via interaction with intracellular targets (for review, see Ref. 14McPhee J.B. Hancock R.E. J. Pept. Sci. 2005; 11: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The human proline-rich protein PR-39, for example, enters bacterial cells without disrupting the plasma membrane and inhibits DNA and protein synthesis (15Boman H.G. Agerberth B. Boman A. Infect.

The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature before iodoacetic acid (0.5 m in 1 m NaOH, 55 μl) was added, and the incubation was continued in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. A Nanosep omega® spin column (3000 molecular mass cut off, PALL Life Sciences) was used to remove salts, dithiothreitol, and iodoacetic acid.

Spores were isolated from sporulating cultures growing in half-strength potato dextrose broth (Fov and T. basicola), Czapeck-Dox broth (V. dahliae) (Difco Laboratories), or 10% (v/v) clarified V8 media (L. maculans and A. nidulans) by filtration through sterile muslin. Spore concentrations were determined using a hemocytometer and adjusted to 5 × 104 spores/ml in the appropriate growth media. Spore suspensions (80 μl) were added to the wells of sterile 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates along with 20 μl of filter sterilized (0.22-μm syringe filter; Millipore) NaD1 or water to give final protein concentrations of 0–10 μm. The plates were shaken briefly and placed in the dark at 25 °C until the optical density at 595 nm of the water control reached ∼0.2 (24–72 h depending on growth rate). Hyphal growth was determined by measuring optical density at 595 nm using a microtiter plate reader (SpectraMax Pro M2; Molecular Devices). Each test was performed in quadruplicate.Yeast Growth Inhibition Assays—The effect of NaD1 on the growth of the yeast strains Candida albicans, Pichia pastoris, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was assayed in microtiter plates. Cells were grown in YPD for 48 h and then counted using a hemocytometer and diluted to a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml in fresh YPD. Cell suspension (100 μl) containing 0–10 μm NaD1 was added to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 48 h at 30 °C.

Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C before they were stained with trypan blue (Sigma) to check viability and counted using a hemocytometer.Membrane Permeabilization Assay—Fov hyphae were grown in half-strength potato dextrose broth from a starting concentration of 5 × 104 spores/ml for 18 h at 25 °C. Hyphae were incubated with 2 μm reduced and alkylated NaD1 (NaD1R&A) or an equivalent volume of water for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. SYTOX green (Molecular Probes) was added (final concentration of 0.5 μm), and the hyphae were allowed to stand for 10 min. Fluorescence of hyphae in microtiter trays was measured using a fluorometer (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 538 nm, respectively, or visualized using an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope with an MWIB filter (excitation wavelength 460–490 nm).FITC Dextran Assay—Fov hyphae were grown as described above and incubated with NaD1 (0–50 μm) for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Hyphae were washed twice for 10 min with half-strength potato dextrose broth to remove NaD1 before FITC dextrans of either 4 kDa (FD-4, Sigma) or 10 kDa (FD-10, Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Hyphae were incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature and then washed twice with half-strength potato dextrose broth to remove excess dextrans. Hyphae were visualized using an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope with an MWIB filter (excitation wavelength 460–490 nm). The assay was also repeated with dextrans being added at the same time as NaD1 to identify transient pores.Immunofluorescence Detection of NaD1 on hyphal Cell Wall— Fov hyphae were grown as described above and incubated with NaD1 or water for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Hyphae were washed twice in 0.6 m KCl and fixed in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Hyphae were washed twice in 0.6 m KCl before they were air-dried onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips. Coverslips were placed in 6-well microtiter plates and covered in blocking buffer (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h. Blocking buffer was then removed, and hyphae were immersed in Protein-A purified anti-NaD1 primary antibody (1/200 dilution) for 1 h. Hyphae were washed (3 × 10 min) with blocking buffer before the addition of an Alexa Fluor® 568-labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1/200 dilution, Molecular Probes). After 1 h, hyphae were washed with blocking buffer (3 × 15 min) and placed onto glass slides with Slow Fade® antifade solution (Molecular Probes) for visualization by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope with an MNG2 filter (excitation wavelength 530–550 nm).Isolation of NaD1 from Treated Hyphae—Fov hyphae were grown as described previously prior to the addition of NaD1 (10 μm final concentration) to 1 ml of culture. Samples (100 μl) were collected after 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Hyphae were collected by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g), and the supernatant was stored at -20 °C for analysis. Hyphae were washed (2 × 10 min) with KCl (0.6 m) to remove any ionically bound protein before they were resuspended in 50 mm CAPS buffer (pH 10.0) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min. Hyphae were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant, containing cell wall proteins, was collected for analysis. The pellet (containing cells) was resuspended in water, and the cells were lysed using glass beads (Sigma, 60 mg) and vortexing (3 × 10 min). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant (containing cytoplasmic contents) was collected for analysis. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-NaD1 antibody.Labeling of NaD1 with a Bimane Fluorescent Tag—Lyophilized NaD1 was dissolved in 0.1 m MES buffer (pH 5.0) to a final concentration of 2 mm. The fluorescent tag bimane amine (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm along with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (final concentration 2 mm). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with gentle stirring before centrifugation (10 min, 13,000 rpm) to remove any precipitated protein. A Nanosep omega® spin column (3000 molecular mass cut off, PALL Life Sciences) was used to remove salts, unbound bimane amine, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide from the labeled protein. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay.Fluorescence Microscopy of NaD1-Bimane—Hyphae grown for 18 h as described above were treated with NaD1-bimane (2 μm) for between 30 min and 6 h. Hyphae were then visualized by fluorescent microscopy using an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope with an MWU filter (excitation wavelength of 330–385 nm).Fixation and Immunogold Labeling for Electron Microscopy— Hyphae that had been treated with 2 μm NaD1 as described above were washed three times in PBS before fixation in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Hyphae were again washed three times in PBS before dehydration in a standard ethanol series (15 min each, 50, 70, and 90% ethanol, 3 × 15 min 100% ethanol). Hyphae were then infiltrated with LR White resin (ProSciTech) for 1 h at room temperature followed by 18 h at 4 °C, 1 h at room temperature, and 24 h at 60 °C. Fresh LR White was used at each step. Ultrathin sections were cut and placed on Formvar-coated gold grids. Grids were blocked with PBS containing 8% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 h and labeled with Protein-A purified anti-NaD1 antibodies (2 μg/ml) for 1 h. Grids were washed in blocking solution (3 × 10 min) and labeled with 15 nm gold particle-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (ProSciTech) for 1 h. Grids were washed again in blocking solution (3 × 10 min) and then water (15 min) before being air-dried. A JEOL JEM2010HC x e80 KV transmission electron microscope was used to examine labeled grids, and pictures were taken on Kodak EM film (ProSciTech) and developed in a dark room before scanning on a Hewlett Packard Scanjet 5P scanner.Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species—Fov hyphae were grown as described above and incubated with 5 μg/ml dihydrorhodamine 123 (Sigma) for 2 h followed by extensive washing with growth medium. Hyphae were then treated with NaD1 (2 μm) or water for 1 h before being washed with 0.6 m KCl. Fluorescence was then measured on a SpectraMax M2 fluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 538 nm, respectively, or visualized by fluorescence microscopy.RESULTSAntifungal Activity of NaD1NaD1 was tested in vitro against the filamentous fungi F. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (Fov), V. dahliae, T. basicola, A. nidulans, and Leptospheria maculans. At 1 μm, NaD1 retarded the growth of Fov and L. maculans by 50%, whereas V. dahliae, T. basicola, and A. nidulans were all inhibited by ∼65%. At 5 μm NaD1, the growth of all five species was inhibited by more than 90%. NaD1 had no effect on the growth of the yeast strains S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and P. pastoris or the Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains tested (Table 1). Additionally, it was not toxic to mammalian HeLa cells. The addition of 1 mm Ca2+ to the growth medium abolished activity and reduction, and alkylation of NaD1 rendered the protein inactive (data not shown), demonstrating that the three-dimensional structure of the protein is essential for activity.TABLE 1Growth inhibitory effects of NaD1 on various cell typesCell typeNaD1 IC50μmF. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum1.0L. maculans0.80A. nidulans0.80V. dahliae0.75T. basicola0.80C. albicans>10S. cerevisiae>10P. pastoris>10S. aureus>10B. cereus>10E. coli>10P. aeruginosa>10HeLa cells>10 Open table in a new tab Binding of NaD1 to the Cell Walls of FovPotential binding of NaD1 to the cell surface of Fov was investigated using immunofluorescence with an antibody raised to NaD1 isolated from N. alata flowers. NaD1 bound along the entire length of the cell surface in hyphae treated with 2 μm NaD1 (Fig. 1). No background fluorescence was detected in controls in which the NaD1 was omitted. Another control employed another ∼6-kDa cysteine-rich protein and its corresponding specific antibody. This protein, C1, is a proteinase inhibitor from the flowers of N. alata and does not retard the growth of Fov hyphae (16Lay F.T. Brugliera F. Anderson M.A. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). C1 did not bind to the hyphae. To determine whether NaD1 was binding to the cell wall or the plasma membrane, the cell wall of treated hyphae was solubilized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. NaD1 was present in these samples (Fig. 2), suggesting that the interaction of NaD1 with the cell surface was due, at least in part, to binding to the cell wall and that it was not restricted to the plasma membrane. Binding to the cell wall occurred rapidly (within 5 min) and increased over the next 60 min. In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, no binding of NaD1 to the cell wall was detected (data not shown).FIGURE 2Detection of NaD1 in isolated Fov cell walls and cytoplasmic contents. Proteins from the culture medium, solubilized cell walls, and cytoplasmic contents from Fov hyphae treated with NaD1 were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-NaD1 antibody. NaD1 was present in the cell wall fraction after 5 min, and the amount present increased up until 60 min. NaD1 appeared in the cytoplasmic contents after 30 min. Purified NaD1 (1 μg) was used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Membrane Permeabilization by NaD1SYTOX Green Assay—Permeabilization of the Fov hyphae by NaD1 was measured using the fluorescent dye SYTOX green. SYTOX green fluorescence increases substantially upon binding to nucleic acids, but the dye only enters cells when the plasma membrane is compromised. At a very low non-inhibitory concentration of NaD1 (0.1 μm), a small degree of permeabilization could be seen (Fig. 3). The nuclei of these permeabilized hyphae appeared intact, and the cytoplasm appeared unaltered (Fig. 4). NaD1-induced permeabilization increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). At higher concentrations of NaD1, the SYTOX green formed a diffuse pattern of fluorescence across the cell. The nuclei were no longer intact, and the cytoplasm of all permeabilized hyphae appeared granular (Fig. 4). The entry of SYTOX green into the Fov hyphae occurred within 10 min of the addition of NaD1. No permeabilization was observed in hyphae treated with reduced and alkylated NaD1 (NaD1R&A).FIGURE 3Permeabilization and growth inhibition of NaD1-treated hyphae. Hyphae were treated with 0.1, 2, or 10 μm NaD1 or 10 μm NaD1R&A. Growth inhibition was measured relative to a no protein control (line, %, right axis), and permeabilization was measured by incubation with SYTOX green (column, fluorescence units, left axis). Hyphae were permeabilized at all concentrations of NaD1, even below the minimum concentration for inhibition of hyphal growth. Hyphae treated with water or NaD1R&A showed no growth inhibition or permeabilization. The figure is representative of three separate experiments, and error bars represent S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4SYTOX green uptake into NaD1-treated hyphae. Fov hyphae were incubated with SYTOX green after treatment with 0.1 μm NaD1 (a) or 2 μm NaD1 (b). At 0.1 μm NaD1, permeabilized hyphae appeared normal under bright field microscopy, and SYTOX green was located in nuclei (block arrow) and not in vacuoles (unfilled arrow). At 2 μm NaD1, the cytoplasm of the permeabilized hyphae appeared granular, and organelles were no longer distinguishable, indicating a loss of integrity of internal membranes. Scale bar = 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Predicted Aperture Size—In an effort to determine whether NaD1 forms an aperture of a distinct size or merely destabilizes the plasma membrane as predicted in the carpet model, NaD1-treated hyphae were incubated with FITC-labeled dextrans of either 4 kDa (average globular diameter of 14 Å) or 10 kDa (average globular diameter of 23 Å). Dextrans of 4 kDa entered hyphae at the same NaD1 concentration that led to SYTOX green uptake (molecular mass ∼650 Da), whereas 10 kDa dextrans were excluded even at very high concentrations of NaD1 (Fig. 5). To examine whether aperture formation by NaD1 was transient or relatively stable, the assay was conducted in two ways. Dextrans were either added at the same time as NaD1 or added after removal of unbound NaD1 by extensive washing. The 4-kDa FITC-dextran was able to enter under both conditions.FIGURE 5Entry of fluorescently labeled dextrans into Fov hyphae in the presence of NaD1. Fov hyphae were incubated with SYTOX green, FD-4 or FD-10 in the presence of 0, 0.1, 2, 10, or 50 μm NaD1 and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. FD-4 entered NaD1-treated hyphae, whereas FD-10 was excluded in all cases. The inset represents bright field view. Scale bar = 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Entry of NaD1 into Fungal HyphaeImmunoblotting of Cytoplasmic Contents—Cytoplasmic contents of hyphae treated with NaD1 were examined after various time points by immunoblotting. NaD1 appeared in the cytoplasm after 30 min, and the amount increased up to 60 min (Fig. 2). After 60 min, the amount of NaD1 in the cytoplasm appeared to decrease; however, this may be due to loss of NaD1 from dying hyphae.Electron Microscopy—Hyphae treated with either NaD1 (10 μm) or water for 2 h were washed, fixed, and sectioned for immunogold labeling using the anti-NaD1 antibody and visualized by electron microscopy. In the NaD1-treated sections, there were a number of hyphae with granulated cytoplasm. Interestingly, NaD1 was abundant inside these hyphae but was absent from hyphae that appeared healthy (Fig. 6, a and b). Labeling was not observed when NaD1-treated hyphae with granular cytoplasm were probed with preimmune antibody (Fig. 6d). Hyphae that were not exposed to NaD1 had no signs of granulation and did not bind the anti-NaD1 antibody (Fig. 6c).FIGURE 6Electron microscopy of NaD1-treated hyphae. Fov hyphae were incubated with either 10 NaD1 (a, b, and d) or water (c) for 2 h. Hyphae were then probed with either the anti-NaD1 antibody (a–c) or the preimmune antibody (d). NaD1 was found at high concentrations inside a number of treated hyphae (a) but not all (b). NaD1-treated hyphae labeled with preimmune antibody showed no significant labeling above that observed in the control sections (d). Water-treated hyphae did not appear granular and were not labeled with the anti-NaD1 antibody (c). Scale bar = 200 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Labeling of NaD1 with the Fluorophore Bimane—Uptake of NaD1 into living hyphae was observed using NaD1 that had been labeled with the fluorophore bimane-amine. The NaD1 labeled in this manner retained full antifungal activity (Fig. 7A). NaD1-bimane was taken up by hyphae within 30 min, and after 2 h, hyphae that had internalized NaD1 developed granular cytoplasm (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7Antifungal activity of bimane-labeled NaD1.

The non-fluorescent molecule dihydrorhodamine 123 was preloaded into hyphae, which were then treated with NaD1. Upon production of reactive oxygen species, dihydrorhodamine 123 is oxidized to the fluorescent molecule rhodamine 123. A concentration-dependent accumulation of intracellular ROS was observed in Fov hyphae following exposure to NaD1 (Fig. 8).FIGURE 8Production of Reactive Oxygen Species.

In the present study, we evaluated the diffusion of pandemic influenza in Italy and the impact of various control measures, coupling a global SEIR model for importation of cases with an individual based model (IBM) describing the Italian epidemic.We co-located the Italian population (57 million inhabitants) to households, schools and workplaces and we assigned travel destinations to match the 2001 census data. We considered different R(0 )values (1.4; 1.7; 2), evaluating the impact of control measures (vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis -AVP-, international air travel restrictions and increased social distancing). The administration of two vaccine doses was considered, assuming that first dose would be administered 1-6 months after the first world case, and different values for vaccine effectiveness (VE). With no interventions, importation would occur 37-77 days after the first world case. Air travel restrictions would delay the importation of the pandemic by 7-37 days. With an R(0 )of 1.4 or 1.7, the use of combined measures would reduce clinical attack rates (AR) from 21-31% to 0.3-4%. Assuming an R(0) of 2, the AR would decrease from 38% to 8%, yet only if vaccination were started within 2 months of the first world case, in combination with a 90% reduction in international air traffic, closure of schools/workplaces for 4 weeks and AVP of household and school/work close contacts of clinical cases. Varying VE would not substantially affect the results.This IBM, which is based on country-specific demographic data, could be suitable for the real-time evaluation of measures to be undertaken in the event of the emergence of a new pandemic influenza virus. All preventive measures considered should be implemented to mitigate the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W2017157097,"Our knowledge on zebrafish reproduction is very limited. We generated a gonad-derived cDNA microarray from zebrafish and used it to analyze large-scale gene expression profiles in adult gonads and other organs.We have identified 116638 gonad-derived zebrafish expressed sequence tags (ESTs), 21% of which were isolated in our lab. Following in silico normalization, we constructed a gonad-derived microarray comprising 6370 unique, full-length cDNAs from differentiating and adult gonads. Labeled targets from adult gonad, brain, kidney and 'rest-of-body' from both sexes were hybridized onto the microarray. Our analyses revealed 1366, 881 and 656 differentially expressed transcripts (34.7% novel) that showed highest expression in ovary, testis and both gonads respectively. Hierarchical clustering showed correlation of the two gonadal transcriptomes and their similarities to those of the brains. In addition, we have identified 276 genes showing sexually dimorphic expression both between the brains and between the gonads. By in situ hybridization, we showed that the gonadal transcripts with the strongest array signal intensities were germline-expressed. We found that five members of the GTP-binding septin gene family, from which only one member (septin 4) has previously been implicated in reproduction in mice, were all strongly expressed in the gonads.We have generated a gonad-derived zebrafish cDNA microarray and demonstrated its usefulness in identifying genes with sexually dimorphic co-expression in both the gonads and the brains. We have also provided the first evidence of large-scale differential gene expression between female and male brains of a teleost. Our microarray would be useful for studying gonad development, differentiation and function not only in zebrafish but also in related teleosts via cross-species hybridizations. Since several genes have been shown to play similar roles in gonadogenesis in zebrafish and other vertebrates, our array may even provide information on genetic disorders affecting gonadal phenotypes and fertility in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2038368021,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate activated heptahelical receptors, leading to their uncoupling from G proteins. Here we report six crystal structures of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), revealing not only three distinct nucleotide-binding states of a GRK but also two key structural elements believed to be involved in the recognition of activated GPCRs. The first is the C-terminal extension of the kinase domain, which was observed in all nucleotide-bound GRK1 structures. The second is residues 5-30 of the N terminus, observed in one of the GRK1.(Mg2+)2.ATP structures. The N terminus was also clearly phosphorylated, leading to the identification of two novel phosphorylation sites by mass spectral analysis. Co-localization of the N terminus and the C-terminal extension near the hinge of the kinase domain suggests that activated GPCRs stimulate kinase activity by binding to this region to facilitate full closure of the kinase domain."
https://openalex.org/W1973495504,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad52 protein plays an essential role in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Rad52 and its orthologs possess the unique capacity to anneal single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) complexed with its cognate ssDNA-binding protein, RPA. This annealing activity is used in multiple mechanisms of DSB repair: single-stranded annealing, synthesis-dependent strand annealing, and cross-over formation. Here we report that the S. cerevisiae DNA strand exchange protein, Rad51, prevents Rad52-mediated annealing of complementary ssDNA. Efficient inhibition is ATP-dependent and involves a specific interaction between Rad51 and Rad52. Free Rad51 can limit DNA annealing by Rad52, but the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament is even more effective. We also discovered that the budding yeast Rad52 paralog, Rad59 protein, partially restores Rad52-dependent DNA annealing in the presence of Rad51, suggesting that Rad52 and Rad59 function coordinately to enhance recombinational DNA repair either by directing the processed DSBs to repair by DNA strand annealing or by promoting second end capture to form a double Holliday junction. This regulation of Rad52-mediated annealing suggests a control function for Rad51 in deciding the recombination path taken for a processed DNA break; the ssDNA can be directed to either Rad51-mediated DNA strand invasion or to Rad52-mediated DNA annealing. This channeling determines the nature of the subsequent repair process and is consistent with the observed competition between these pathways in vivo.

Genes from the RAD52 epistasis group, including RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55-57, RAD59, MRE11, XRS2, and RFA1, are responsible for this recombination-dependent DSB repair (1Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). To repair a DSB, the DNA end is first processed to produce a 3′ single-stranded tailed duplex DNA. The ssDNA is then channeled into one of the many recombinational pathways, which can be further categorized into RAD51-dependent and -independent pathways. RAD51-dependent recombination requires functions of RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, and RFA1 for efficient DNA repair (1Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central step of this pathway involves DNA strand invasion of homologous duplex DNA by the processed DSB complexed with Rad51 protein (3Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA replication from the invading 3′-end replaces the genetic information missing from the broken dsDNA, and subsequent DNA pairing and resolution steps restore DNA integrity.

This RAD51-independent recombination is most easily assayed as DSB repair occurring between directly repeated sequences, by a mechanism termed single-stranded annealing (SSA) (8Ivanov E.L.

As implied, the central step of SSA is annealing between complementary single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) on either side of the DSB, followed by removal of heterologous tails and ligation of the nicks (1Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, RAD51-independent recombination can mediate gene conversion with or without cross-overs (5Bai Y. Symington L.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 13Rattray A.J. Symington L.S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9162-9172Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Genetic studies show that the loss of either the RAD51-dependent or the RAD51-independent pathway only moderately compromises recombinational repair efficiency, whereas the loss of both pathways severely impairs repair (5Bai Y.

Those studies showed a compensatory increase in utilization of one pathway upon elimination of the other and suggested competition between the two pathways. Moreover, examination of RAD52-RAD59-dependent recombination revealed that deletion of RAD51, RAD54, RAD55, or RAD57 results in an elevated utilization of SSA (5Bai Y. Symington L.S.

Both results indicate that RAD51-dependent recombination inhibits RAD52-RAD59-dependent recombination. The Rad52 protein possesses two distinct biochemical functions: the abilities to mediate formation of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament (19New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 20Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 21Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and to catalyze ssDNA annealing in the presence of RPA (replication protein A) (22Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The nucleoprotein complexes that participate in, and result from, each of these biochemical processes are different. The Rad51-ssDNA filament is a dynamic complex that forms after Rad51 transiently displaces both RPA and Rad52 from ssDNA (24Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and that is needed for the homology search, DNA strand invasion, and DNA strand exchange steps essential in the RAD51-dependent pathways. On the other hand, annealing of complementary ssDNA requires the preservation of the Rad52-ssDNA complex, at least on a steady-state basis, rather than the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament. RAD59 displays a wide range of behavior in RAD51-dependent recombination. In the absence of RAD59, heteroallelic recombination between interchromosomal homologous sequences can increase (16Bai Y. Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), slightly decrease (7Jablonovich Z. Liefshitz B. Steinlauf R. Kupiec M. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or remain unaffected (25Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2344-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because recombination in most assay systems is determined by both RAD51-dependent and -independent mechanisms and because deletion of RAD59 has a greater impact on the RAD51-independent pathways, its effect on the RAD51-dependent pathways is often not obvious. However, there are reasons to believe that RAD59 plays a role in the RAD51-dependent pathways. First, the last steps of the RAD51-dependent synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway, which consist of DNA strand annealing, removal of heterologous or over-replicated 3′-ssDNA tails, and gap sealing, are noticeably similar to those of the SSA pathway (1Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 26Nassif N. Penney J. Pal S. Engels W.R. Gloor G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1613-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Proteins that are important for removal of heterologous tails in SSA, the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease and the Msh2-Msh3 mismatch repair complex, are also important for removal of nonhomologous sequences during mating type switching, an SDSA-type of recombination (27Pâques F. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6765-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Second, in a strain defective for the flap endonuclease Rad27, which functions in Okazaki fragment maturation, all of the proteins of the RAD52 epistasis group, i.e. both Rad51 and Rad59, are required for viability (28Debrauwere H. Loeillet S. Lin W. Lopes J. Nicolas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8263-8269Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Symington L.S.

DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Third, in the rad52-R70K background where the functions of RAD52 are partially compromised, deletion of RAD59 causes a synergistic reduction in sporulation efficiency, spore viability, and mating type switch (16Bai Y. Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all of which are dependent on RAD51. Finally, Rad59 interacts with Rad51 indirectly through Rad52 in immunoprecipitation experiments (31Davis A.P. Symington L.S. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it was proposed that Rad59 augments the activity of Rad52 protein in both the RAD51-dependent and -independent pathways (5Bai Y. Symington L.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Bai Y. Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Davis A.P. Symington L.S.

In this report, we demonstrate that Rad51 inhibits Rad52-dependent DNA annealing in vitro not simply by indirect competition for ssDNA, but through a direct interaction with Rad52 itself. However, by working in concert with Rad52, Rad59 partially alleviates the inhibitory effect of Rad51 on DNA annealing. We suggest that this counteracting regulation of Rad52-dependent DNA annealing function by Rad51 and Rad59 determines the biochemical steps that are used for DSB recombinational repair and may serve to enhance the fidelity of second end capture by annealing. DNA Substrates—Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon and were purified using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7 m urea, 9% polyacrylamide, 19:1 cross-linking in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA)). Sequences for the 48-nucleotide annealing substrates ssDNA (W) and ssDNA (C) are 5′-GCAATTAAGCTCTAAGCCATCCGCAAAAATGACCTCTTATCAAAAGGA-3′ and 5′-TCCTTTTGATAAGAGGTCATTTTTGCGGATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATTGC-3′, respectively. Concentration of ssDNA (W) and ssDNA (C) was determined using the extinction coefficient of 1 × 104 and 9.6 × 103 m−1·cm−1, respectively. Sequences for the 100-nucleotide heterologous ssDNA (PB78) and its complementary strand (PB77) are 5′-TGGCCTGCAACGCGGGCATCCCGATGCCGCCGGAAGCGAGAAGAATCATAATGGGGAAGGCCACCAGCCTCGCGTCGCGAACGCCAGCAAGACGTAGCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGCTACGTCTTGCTGGCGTTCGCGACGCGAGGCTGGTGGCCTTCCCCATTATGATTCTTCTCGCTTCCGGCGGCATCGGGATGCCCGCGTTGCAGGCCA-3′, respectively. The concentrations of PB78 and PB77 were determined using the extinction coefficient of 9.7× 103 and 8.9 × 103 m−1·cm−1, respectively. To generate the heterologous dsDNA, two complementary oligonucleotides of equal concentration were mixed together in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was heated at 100 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature slowly over a 2-h period. Proteins—Rad51 (33Zaitseva E.M. Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2907-2915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and RPA (66Kantake N. Sugiyama T. Kolodner R.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23410-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were purified as described. Rad52 was purified as described (19New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) except that the Superose-12 column was substituted with a Superdex-200 column (GE Healthcare). C-terminally His6-tagged Rad59 was purified as described (37Wu Y. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15441-15449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) except that a purification step over ssDNA cellulose was added. In brief, the Rad59 that eluted from Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose was dialyzed against MDEG buffer (25 mm K-MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 100 mm NaCl. The protein was loaded onto an ssDNA-cellulose column, washed with 200 mm NaCl in MDEG, and eluted in the 300 and 400 mm NaCl steps. This fraction was then dialyzed and subjected to Q-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose chromatography as described previously. Because the ssDNA-cellulose step purifies on the basis of ssDNA affinity, the specific activity of Rad59 is ∼2-fold greater than the previous preparation. Escherichia coli RecA was purified as described (67Mirshad J.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and was provided by Dr. Roberto Galletto in our laboratory. E. coli SSB protein was purified as described (68LeBowitz J. Biochemical Mechanism of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage Lambda DNA Replication. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD1985Google Scholar). Human Rad51 (hRad51) protein was purified as described (69Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and was provided by Dr. Anthony Forget in our laboratory. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs. Proteinase K was purchased from Roche Applied Science. DNA Annealing—Unless otherwise indicated, DNA annealing reactions were carried out at 30 °C essentially as described (23Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) using complementary oligonucleotide 25 (ssDNA (W)) and oligonucleotide 26 (ssDNA (C)) (200 nm each); oligonucleotide 25 was labeled at 5′-end. In the control reaction where a protein was omitted, an equal amount of corresponding protein storage buffer was added instead. Where Rad59 is present, Rad52 and Rad59 were preincubated on ice for at least 15 min before adding to the reaction. For reactions without RPA, ssDNA (W) was first incubated with Rad51 (67 nm) in DNA annealing buffer (30 mm Tris OAc, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 1 mm ATP at 30 °C for 5 min. Rad52 (20 nm) was added and incubated for another 5 min before addition of ssDNA (C) to initiate the reaction. For reactions containing RPA, the two oligonucleotides were first incubated with RPA (30 nm) for 5 min in DNA annealing buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP prior to the addition of Rad51 (134 nm). After incubation for 5 min, Rad52 (40 nm) and/or Rad59 (80 nm) were added to initiate the reaction. For each time point, an aliquot was withdrawn into 0.8 volume of stop buffer (1.5% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 4 mg/ml proteinase K, and 10 μm unlabeled ssDNA (W)) and was incubated for another 15 min at 30 °C. The samples were analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (either 6% in 1× TBE or 10% in 0.5× TBE buffer; cross-linking ratio 19:1), and the gels were dried onto DEAE paper (Whatman DE81). The extent of DNA annealing was visualized and quantified using a Storm 860 system (Molecular Dynamics) or a Personal FX phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Pulldown Assay—Protein-protein interactions between Rad51 and Rad59 were studied using pulldown assays with Ni-NTA magnetic beads (Qiagen) as described (34Spies M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 573-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the reaction mixtures contained 1 μm each of Rad51 and Rad59 proteins in interaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 0.2% Triton X-100). The reactions were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C before Ni-NTA magnetic beads were added to final concentration of 1%. The beads were separated from the solution phase using a Qiagen “12-Tube Magnet”. Aliquots (20 μl) from each assay mixture containing unbound proteins were analyzed by 11% SDS-PAGE. The beads were washed three times with 300 μl of interaction buffer to remove unbound proteins. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with two washes of 20 μl of elution buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole) and were analyzed using 11% SDS-PAGE. Rad51 Inhibits Rad52-promoted DNA Annealing of ssDNA Complexed with RPA—Because genetic analyses suggested that Rad51 may block RAD52-RAD59-mediated recombinational repair, we determined the effect of Rad51 on Rad52-promoted DNA annealing in vitro. We used complementary oligonucleotide substrates and analyzed annealing by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). First, we examined DNA annealing in the absence of RPA. We observed that Rad51 itself also promotes DNA annealing, but much more slowly than Rad52-mediated DNA annealing (Fig. 1A); in addition, we noticed that the presence of Rad51 slightly decreased the rate of Rad52-mediated DNA annealing. In the absence of ATP, Rad51 was unable to anneal DNA or inhibit Rad52-mediated annealing (data not shown). Because ATP binding is essential for the binding of Rad51 to ssDNA (33Zaitseva E.M. Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2907-2915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we tentatively concluded that both of these activities reflected a property of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament. RPA plays an important role in recombinational DSB repair; therefore, it was included in all reactions hereafter. We observed that RPA blocked both spontaneous and Rad51-promoted annealing (Fig. 1B, gray squares and green triangles, respectively) but not Rad52-promoted DNA annealing (black squares) (22Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), showing that Rad51 does not displace RPA from these short ssDNA oligonucleotides in these experiments. When Rad52-promoted annealing of the RPA-ssDNA complex was examined in the presence of Rad51, the rate of annealing was reduced (blue triangles). Because we anticipated that the binding of Rad51 to ssDNA could inhibit its annealing by Rad52, we also examined annealing in the absence of ATP. Omitting ATP in the reaction greatly, but not completely, alleviated the inhibition (red circles), suggesting that ATP and/or ssDNA binding by Rad51 is needed for the inhibitory effect. The reduction of DNA annealing was dependent on Rad51 concentration (Fig. 1, C and D, blue squares). As the concentration of Rad51 was increased, the rate of DNA annealing progressively decreased. Where the rate was not inhibited severely (≤67 nm), the amount of dsDNA was nonetheless approaching completion, showing that only the rate of annealing was reduced but not the yield of product. The apparent affinity (Kd) of Rad51 for Rad52 as defined by this assay is ∼100 nm.To eliminate the possibility that Rad51 was displacing RPA from the ssDNA during the 5-min incubation step prior to Rad52 addition and that it was directly competing with Rad52 for ssDNA binding, Rad51 and Rad52 were preincubated and added together to initiate the reaction; the same inhibitory effect was observed (Fig. 1D, red triangles). Finally, the inhibitory effect of Rad51 was the same with a different pair of oligonucleotide substrates of unrelated sequence or plasmid-length ssDNA (data not shown), showing that the effect of Rad51 on Rad52-promoted DNA annealing is not sequence-specific. Thus, we conclude that Rad51 inhibits the DNA annealing activity of Rad52; however, these experiments do not define the mechanism of inhibition, which is addressed in the following sections. Inhibition of Rad52-mediated DNA Annealing by Rad51 Is Species-specific—Both DNA annealing promoted by Rad52 and RPA, and DNA strand exchange promoted by Rad51, Rad52, and RPA require species-specific interactions (19New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 23Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 24Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rad51 inhibited Rad52-mediated DNA annealing through species-specific interactions, the reactions were carried out with Rad51 or RPA replaced by their corresponding counterparts from E. coli, RecA, or SSB proteins (Fig. 2). RecA did not inhibit Rad52-mediated annealing of RPA-coated ssDNA (Fig. 2, blue lines, compare filled and open squares). The annealing observed was not being promoted by the RecA, because RPA blocked RecA-mediated annealing completely (green triangles). To eliminate the concern that RecA may not be fully active at 30 °C, the experiments were repeated at 37 °C, and the same results were obtained (data not shown). Therefore, RecA does not repress Rad52-mediated DNA annealing. These results mirror our previous observations that RPA inhibits RecA nucleoprotein filament formation and that Rad52 does not enable RecA to overcome this inhibition (24Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). SSB does not interact with Rad52, nor does it fully permit Rad52-mediated DNA annealing (23Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). When SSB was substituted for RPA, a slow but measurable rate of ssDNA annealing was detected (Fig. 2, red filled squares). However, in contrast to the results with RecA, this residual level of DNA annealing was blocked by Rad51 to the background level (Fig. 2, red open squares). Previously, we established that Rad52 does not facilitate Rad51 nucleoprotein filament formation on SSB-coated ssDNA (24Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); hence, the inhibition of DNA annealing that we see here (in the presence of SSB) is not due to Rad51 nucleoprotein filament formation. Therefore, efficient DNA annealing by Rad52 is dependent on the specific interaction between Rad52 and RPA, whereas inhibition by Rad51 requires Rad52 but not RPA. Therefore, our collective results show that Rad51 does not block Rad52-promoted DNA annealing by indirect competition via displacement of RPA (or Rad52) from ssDNA; instead, Rad51 controls DNA annealing via direct species-specific interactions with Rad52. Rad52 Promotes DNA Annealing between RPA-ssDNA and Rad51-ssDNA Complexes, but at a Reduced Rate—In the previous experiments, DNA annealing was examined using only RPA-coated ssDNA. However, it is possible that one of the ssDNA substrates for DNA annealing in vivo is bound by Rad51 protein. To mimic such a potential physiological reaction, we carried out DNA annealing with RPA bound to one of the complementary ssDNA substrates, and Rad51 bound to the other (Fig. 3). For these reactions, RPA-ssDNA and Rad51-ssDNA complexes were preassembled separately, and then Rad52 was added (triangles); in all cases, DNA annealing was accelerated relative to the Rad52-free control (squares). However, DNA annealing was the slowest when yeast Rad51 was present (blue triangles), faster with human Rad51 (green triangles), and fastest with either RecA or RPA (red or black triangles, respectively). These results are consistent with our results in the previous section showing that the cognate Rad51 is the most potent inhibitor of Rad52, and they further establish that that the closely related human Rad51 is capable of a weaker but significant inhibition. These hierarchy of inhibition is consistent with our previous studies with the RecA-loading domain of E. coli RecBCD enzyme (34Spies M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 573-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which established that interaction with the cognate DNA strand exchange protein, RecA, was the strongest, but other prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA strand exchange proteins bound to the RecA-loading domain with reduced affinities that paralleled phylogenetic distance. The Rad51 Nucleoprotein Filament Is the Strongest Inhibitor of Rad52-mediated DNA Annealing—The reduction of Rad52-mediated DNA annealing by Rad51 protein in the presence of ATP described above (Fig. 1) could be easily explained if Rad51 simply displaced Rad52 (and RPA) from the ssDNA to form a Rad51-ssDNA filament (24Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Bi"
https://openalex.org/W2064725210,"Protein kinase D (PKD) is a serine/threonine protein kinase rapidly activated by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists via a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway. Recently, PKD has been implicated in the regulation of long term cellular activities, but little is known about the mechanism(s) of sustained PKD activation. Here, we show that cell treatment with the preferential PKC inhibitors GF 109203X or Gö 6983 blocked rapid (1-5-min) PKD activation induced by bombesin stimulation, but this inhibition was greatly diminished at later times of bombesin stimulation (e.g. 45 min). These results imply that GPCR-induced PKD activation is mediated by early PKC-dependent and late PKC-independent mechanisms. Western blot analysis with site-specific antibodies that detect the phosphorylated state of the activation loop residues Ser(744) and Ser(748) revealed striking PKC-independent phosphorylation of Ser(748) as well as Ser(744) phosphorylation that remained predominantly but not completely PKC-dependent at later times of bombesin or vasopressin stimulation (20-90 min). To determine the mechanisms involved, we examined activation loop phosphorylation in a set of PKD mutants, including kinase-deficient, constitutively activated, and PKD forms in which the activation loop residues were substituted for alanine. Our results show that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the activation loop Ser(744) and Ser(748) is the primary mechanism involved in early phase PKD activation, whereas PKD autophosphorylation on Ser(748) is a major mechanism contributing to the late phase of PKD activation occurring in cells stimulated by GPCR agonists. The present studies identify a novel mechanism induced by GPCR activation that leads to late, PKC-independent PKD activation."
https://openalex.org/W1989227252,"Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are responsible for 20% cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the mechanism of motor neuron degeneration caused by ALS-linked SOD1 mutants is not fully understood. Here, we used novel live cell imaging techniques to demonstrate the subcellular localization of EGFP-fused SOD1 of both wild-type (WT) and ALS-linked mutant forms in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. The presence of WT and mutant SOD1 species in luminal structures was further confirmed by immunoblotting analysis of microsomal fractions from spinal cord lysates of SOD1 transgenic mice prepared by sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation. Chemical cross-linking studies also revealed an age-dependent aggregation of mutant SOD1, but not of WT SOD1, prominently in the microsomal fraction. Cell-free translocation assays provided evidence that monomeric SOD1 is a molecular form that can be translocated into luminal structures in the presence of ATP. Our finding that the ER-Golgi pathway is a predominant cellular site of aggregation of mutant SOD1 suggests that secretion could play a key role in pathogenesis, which is in line with the view that the disease is non-cell autonomous."
https://openalex.org/W1994363140,"Recently we have shown that the metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor can be expressed on nuclear membranes of heterologous cells or endogenously on striatal neurons where it can mediate nuclear Ca2+ changes. Here, pharmacological, optical, and genetic techniques were used to show that upon activation, nuclear mGlu5 receptors generate nuclear inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in situ. Specifically, expression of an mGlu5 F767S mutant in HEK293 cells that blocks Gq/11 coupling or introduction of a dominant negative Galphaq construct in striatal neurons prevented nuclear Ca2+ changes following receptor activation. These data indicate that nuclear mGlu5 receptors couple to Gq/11 to mobilize nuclear Ca2+. Nuclear mGlu5-mediated Ca2+ responses could also be blocked by the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, U73122, the phosphatidylinositol (PI) PLC inhibitor 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (ET-18-OCH3), or by using small interfering RNA targeted against PLCbeta1 demonstrating that PI-PLC is involved. Direct assessment of inositol phosphate production using a PIP2/IP3 ""biosensor"" revealed for the first time that IP3 can be generated in the nucleus following activation of nuclear mGlu5 receptors. Finally, both IP3 and ryanodine receptor blockers prevented nuclear mGlu5-mediated increases in intranuclear Ca2+. Collectively, this study shows that like plasma membrane receptors, activated nuclear mGlu5 receptors couple to Gq/11 and PLC to generate IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from Ca2+-release channels in the nucleus. Thus the nucleus can function as an autonomous organelle independent of signals originating in the cytoplasm, and nuclear mGlu5 receptors play a dynamic role in mobilizing Ca2+ in a specific, localized fashion."

Here we focus on the early ER-delimited steps of the SOCE pathway and demonstrate that STIM1 is critically involved in initiating of production of calcium influx factor (CIF), a diffusible messenger that can deliver the signal from the stores to plasma membrane and activate SOCE. We discovered that CIF production is tightly coupled with STIM1 expression and requires functional integrity of its intraluminal sterile alpha-motif (SAM) domain. We demonstrate that 1) molecular knockdown or overexpression of STIM1 results in corresponding impairment or amplification of CIF production and 2) inherent deficiency in the ER-delimited CIF production and SOCE activation in some cell types can be a result of their deficiency in STIM1 protein; expression of a wild-type STIM1 in such cells was sufficient to fully rescue their ability to produce CIF and SOCE. We found that glycosylation sites in the ER-resident SAM domain of STIM1 are essential for initiation of CIF production. We propose that after STIM1 loses Ca(2+) from EF hand, its intraluminal SAM domain may change conformation, and via glycosylation sites it can interact with and activate CIF-producing machinery. Thus, CIF production appears to be one of the earliest STIM1-dependent events in the ER lumen, and impairment of this process results in impaired SOCE response."
https://openalex.org/W2009897967,"Chronic use of inhaled beta-agonists by asthmatics is associated with a loss of bronchoprotective effect and deterioration of asthma control. Beta-agonist-promoted desensitization of airway smooth muscle beta-2-adrenergic receptors, mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins, is presumed to underlie these effects, but such a mechanism has never been demonstrated. Using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo murine models, we demonstrate that beta-arrestin-2 gene ablation augments beta-agonist-mediated airway smooth muscle relaxation, while augmenting beta-agonist-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. In cultures of human airway smooth muscle, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of arrestins also augments beta-agonist-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. Interestingly, signaling and function mediated by m2/m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors or prostaglandin E(2) receptors were not affected by either beta-arrestin-2 knockout or arrestin knockdown. Thus, arrestins are selective regulators of beta-2-adrenergic receptor signaling and function in airway smooth muscle. These results and our previous findings, which demonstrate a role for arrestins in the development of allergic inflammation in the lung, identify arrestins as potentially important therapeutic targets for obstructive airway diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2086564653,"The present study demonstrated that invadopodia are associated with invasion by degradation of matrix in prostate cancer cells PC3. To find out the presence of invadopodia in PC3 cells, we performed a few comparative analyses with osteoclasts, which utilize podosomes for migration. Our investigations indeed demonstrated that invadopodia are comparable to podosomes in the localization of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)/matrix metalloproteinase-9 and the degradation of matrix. Invadopodia are different from podosomes in the localization of actin/vinculin, distribution during migration, and the mode of degradation of extracellular matrix. Invadopodia enable polarized invasion of PC3 cells into the gelatin matrix in a time-dependent manner. Gelatin degradation was confined within the periphery of the cell. Osteoclasts demonstrated directional migration with extensive degradation of matrix underneath and around the osteoclasts. A pathway of degradation of matrix representing a migratory track was observed due to the rearrangement of podosomes as rosettes or clusters at the leading edge. Reducing the matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels by RNA interference inhibited the degradation of matrix but not the formation of podosomes or invadopodia. Competition experiments with TAT-fused WASP peptides suggest that actin polymerization and formation of invadopodia involve the WASP-Arp2/3 complex pathway. Moreover, PC3 cells overexpressing osteopontin (OPN) displayed an increase in the number of invadopodia and gelatinolytic activity as compared with PC3 cells and PC3 cells expressing mutant OPN in integrin-binding domain and null for OPN. Thus, we conclude that OPN/integrin αvβ3 signaling participates in the process of migration and invasion of PC3 cells through regulating processes essential for the formation and function of invadopodia."

https://openalex.org/W1968421437,"Activation of proMMP-2 and cell surface collagenolysis are important activities of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) to promote cell migration in tissue, and these activities are regulated by homodimerization of MT1-MMP on the cell surface. In this study, we have identified the transmembrane domain as a second dimer interface of MT1-MMP in addition to the previously identified hemopexin domain. Our analyses indicate that these two modes of dimerization have different roles; transmembrane-dependent dimerization is critical for proMMP-2 activation, whereas hemopexin-dependent dimerization is important for degradation of collagen on the cell surface. Our finding provides new insight into the potential molecular arrangement of MT1-MMP contributing to its function on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2024695240,"AzoR is an FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductase isolated from Escherichia coli as a protein responsible for the degradation of azo compounds. We previously reported the crystal structure of the enzyme in the oxidized form. In the present study, different structures of AzoR were determined under several conditions to obtain clues to the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. AzoR in its reduced form revealed a twisted butterfly bend of the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN cofactor and a rearrangement of solvent molecules. The crystal structure of oxidized AzoR in a different space group and the structure of the enzyme in complex with the inhibitor dicoumarol were also determined. These structures indicate that the formation of a hydrophobic part around the isoalloxazine ring is important for substrate binding and an electrostatic interaction between Arg-59 and the carboxyl group of the azo compound causes a substrate preference for methyl red over p-methyl red. The substitution of Arg-59 with Ala enhanced the Vmax value for p-methyl red 27-fold with a 3.8-fold increase of the Km value. This result indicates that Arg-59 decides the substrate specificity of AzoR. The Vmax value for the p-methyl red reduction of the R59A mutant is comparable with that for the methyl red reduction of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the activity toward methyl red was retained. These findings indicate the expansion of AzoR substrate specificity by a single amino acid substitution.

AzoR exists as a homodimer composed of 23-kDa subunits. The reaction follows a ping-pong mechanism requiring 2 mol of NADH to reduce 1 mol of methyl red (4′-dimethylaminoazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid), a typical azo dye, into 2-aminobenzoic acid and N,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine. AzoR also can reduce ethyl red (4′-diethylaminoazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid) and menadione (vitamin K3, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) and is inhibited by dicoumarol (3,3′-methylene-bis(4-hydroxycoumarin)). Biochemical studies also revealed that, compared with other azoreductases so far reported, AzoR is different in several regards: in its requirements for cofactors, electron donors, substrate specificity, and amino acid sequence. On the other hand, although the physiological function of AzoR remains unknown, genome projects have inferred its importance from the wide distribution of highly homologous genes in many microorganisms (2Chain P.S.

Because their detailed molecular reaction mechanisms remain largely unknown, AzoR is an interesting case for azoreductase research. Structural and enzymatic insights into AzoR provide knowledge of the molecular mechanism underlying the reduction of azo compounds and would also provide important clues for substrate-specificity expansion techniques that will be essential for industrial use of the enzyme in the biodegradation process of azo compounds. In this study, we have determined the structure of reduced AzoR. This work reveals the structural changes upon reduction of the enzyme and is the first report on the crystal structure of homodimeric flavodoxin-like proteins in the reduced state. In addition, we have determined the crystal structure of oxidized AzoR in a different space group as well as the crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with the inhibitor dicoumarol. Substrate-specificity analysis and site-directed mutagenesis were also performed. According to these analyses, we succeeded in expanding AzoR substrate specificity, and we have built an authentic model of an AzoR-methyl red complex. Finally, the mechanisms underlying the reductive cleavage of azo compounds are discussed. Protein Preparation for Crystallization—The recombinant AzoR used for crystallization was expressed and purified as described previously (1Nakanishi M. Yatome C. Ishida N. Kitade Y. J. Biol.

Improvement of the Quality of the Tetragonal Crystals of Oxidized AzoR—The improved oxidized tetragonal crystals (P42212) were obtained in the same crystallization method as reported previously (21Ito K. Nakanishi M. Lee W.C. Sasaki H. Zenno S. Saigo K. Kitade Y. Tanokura M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallalliz. Commun. 2005; 61: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), except that 0.1 mm warfarin (4-hydroxy-3-(3-oxo-1-phenylbutyl)coumarin) was added to the crystallization solution as an additive reagent for crystal growth (the electron density of warfarin was not observed). The crystals grew to full size (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.6 mm) within 1 week. Chemical Reduction of the Tetragonal Crystals of Oxidized AzoR—Crystals of the enzyme in the reduced state were prepared by transferring the oxidized tetragonal crystals to a degassed reducing solution containing 200 mm MgCl2, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30% (v/v) 2-propanol, 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and a saturated concentration of sodium dithionite at 4 °C. After 10 min, the crystals were transferred to fresh reducing solution. This procedure was repeated two more times. The crystals lost their bright yellow color and became transparent over the course of the treatment. They were then immediately flash-cooled in a stream of nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. It was verified that the crystal remained transparent after data collection. Co-crystallization with Dicoumarol—The purified protein was dialyzed against a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm FMN, 4% (v/v) pyridine, and 2 mm dicoumarol. Crystals of AzoR in complex with dicoumarol were obtained from a drop made by mixing 16 mg/ml of the protein solution mentioned above and an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000. The drop was equilibrated over the reservoir solution by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. The crystals grew to full size (0.05 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm) within 1 week. These crystals belonged to the tetragonal space group P4212. Crystallization of the Orthorhombic Crystals of Oxidized AzoR—The purified protein was dialyzed against a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm FMN. The orthorhombic (P212121) crystals of oxidized AzoR were obtained from a drop made by equal volumes of three solutions: 8 mg/ml of the protein solution mentioned above, 100 mm NAD+ solution (the electron density of NAD+ was not observed), and a reservoir solution containing 200 mm NaOAc, 200 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.7, 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 3% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The drop was equilibrated over the reservoir solution by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 25 °C. The crystals grew to full size (0.03 × 0.05 × 0.5 mm) within 2 weeks. Data Collection and Processing—All diffraction data were collected under cryogenic conditions at 100 K. Prior to data collection, the crystals were soaked in a reservoir solution containing 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol or 25% (v/v) glycerol as a cryo-protectant. All diffraction data were collected at KEK (Tsukuba, Japan). The beamlines used are shown in Table 1.

The solutions were then improved by ARP/wARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nature Struct.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). For the refinement of the oxidized and reduced tetragonal crystal structures, the restraint of the planarity of the isoalloxazine ring was removed from the standard REFMAC5 library to allow the model to adopt the omit density map more precisely. Model Analysis—The quality of the model was checked with PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. App. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). LSQKAB was used to superpose the molecules and to calculate the root mean square deviation between pairs of equivalent Cα atoms and all atoms of the proteins (28Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Structure figures were prepared with PyMOL (29DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Mutant Preparations—For enzymatic analyses, mutations and C-terminal His tag were introduced into the AzoR gene by two rounds of PCR with pETacpD as a template (1Nakanishi M. Yatome C. Ishida N. Kitade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46394-46399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The NADH-methyl red reductase activity of the His-tagged wild-type AzoR was very similar to that of the non-tagged wild-type AzoR. To mutate Arg-59 to Ala, the following pairs of oligonucleotide primers were used for the first PCR: 5′-terminal sense primer for AzoR (5′-GGGAATTCCATATGAGCAAGGTATTAGTTCTTAAATCCAGC-3′ containing an NdeI site) and R59A mutation antisense primer (5′-CGGCGCATCGCTCGGAGCCAGAGCGCCAACCAGTTC-3′) were used to amplify the 5′-terminal part of the AzoR gene. R59A mutation sense primer (5′-GAACTGGTTGGCGCTCTGGCTCCGAGCGATGCGCCG-3′) and 3′-terminal antisense primer for AzoR (5′-AAACCGCTCGAGTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTGTGCAGAAACAATGCTGTCGATGGC-3′ containing an XhoI site and His6 tag sequence) were used to amplify the 3′-terminal part of the AzoR gene. PCR products were used as templates for the second PCR, which used the 5′-terminal sense primer and 3′-terminal antisense primer for AzoR. To generate other mutants, the following primers were used in place of R59A mutation sense and antisense primers: Y120A mutation sense primer (5′-GCAGGCGTTACTTTCCGCGCTACCGAGAACGGTCCG-3′) and Y120A mutation antisense primer (5′-CGGACCGTTCTCGGTAGCGCGGAAAGTAACGCCTGC-3′) for Tyr-120 to Ala mutant; F162A mutation sense primer (5′-CCACGTTCCTCGGCGCTATCGGCATTACCGATG-3′) and F162A mutation antisense primer (5′-CATCGGTAATGCCGATAGCGCCGAGGAACGTGG-3′) for Phe-162 to Ala mutant. To generate the His-tagged wild-type AzoR gene as a control that is catalytically very similar to AzoR, the 5′-terminal sense primer and the 3′-terminal antisense primer for AzoR described above were used for PCR with pETacpD as a template. The PCR product of each mutated AzoR was inserted between the NdeI and the XhoI sites of the expression vector pET-22b (Novagen). The entire DNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. His-tagged wild-type and mutant AzoR proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to early exponential phase cultures (A600 ∼ 0.5) for 3 h. Bacteria were lysed in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 10 mg/ml lysozyme by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged, and the His-tagged proteins were purified by gravity-flow chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted proteins were stored at -80 °C in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm FMN. Protein samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and were more than 95% pure. Enzyme Assays—The NADH-methyl red reductase activity for each mutant was determined spectrophotometrically by a method described previously (1Nakanishi M. Yatome C. Ishida N. Kitade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46394-46399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The initial reaction rates were fitted to the Equation 11v=1V+KAVA+KBVB([Eq. 1]) where v is the initial reaction rate, V is the maximum reaction rate at infinite substrate concentrations, A and B are the concentrations of methyl red and NADH, respectively, and KA and KB are their corresponding Michaelis constants. The initial reaction rate of p-methyl red reduction was determined in the same manner as methyl red, except that a 460-nm wavelength was used to monitor the decrease in absorbance of p-methyl red and a molar absorption coefficient of 17310 m-1 cm-1 was used. KB was applied to obtain Michaelis constants for p-methyl red because KB does not depend on the kind of azo compound. All of these assays were performed in triplicate. Structures of Oxidized and Reduced AzoR in Tetragonal Crystals—The structure of oxidized AzoR in tetragonal crystal was previously determined at 1.8 Å resolution (8Ito K. Nakanishi M. Lee W.C. Sasaki H. Zenno S. Saigo K. Kitade Y. Tanokura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20567-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have now improved the crystallization conditions and increased the resolution to 1.4 Å. In addition, we have determined the structure of reduced AzoR at 1.7 Å resolution using chemically reduced tetragonal crystals. The results allow the stringent comparison of the two states, especially the conformation of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN. The structure of this ring was unambiguously determined without the restraint of planarity for both the oxidized and reduced enzymes (Fig. 1). The reduced crystals turned colorless, indicating that two-electron reduction of the flavin occurred. The data collection and the final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The AzoR structures are nearly identical between the oxidized and reduced states. The root mean square deviations between equivalent 193 Cα atoms and all atoms of the amino acid residues, except hydrogens, in the two states are 0.282 and 0.582 Å, respectively. However, prominent structural differences are found in the active site. In the oxidized enzyme, the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin is nearly planar but shows a slight twist conformation (Fig. 1, A and C). Upon reduction of the enzyme, the isoalloxazine ring adopts a butterfly bend conformation along the N5-N10 axis caused by a shift of the dimethyl and pyrimidine rings toward the re-face by an angle of ∼15° (Fig. 1, B, D, and F). The slight twist conformation found in the oxidized state is retained in the reduced state, and N5 and N10 of the isoalloxazine ring move up toward the si-side. Therefore, the central ring of the isoalloxazine is distorted to a twist-boat conformation upon reduction. The movement of N10 is small relative to that of N5. The other structural changes associated with reduction are a significant movement of a water molecule and a loss of two spherical electron density peaks on FMN. The water molecule, which is hydrogen-bonded to Oδ-1 of Asn-97 in the oxidized state, still forms a hydrogen bond in the reduced state (Fig. 1E). This water molecule, however, moves by 2.4 Å and makes an additional hydrogen bond with N5 of the isoalloxazine ring upon reduction. The protonation of the N5 of the reduced isoalloxazine ring has been proved biochemically (30Muller F. Muller F Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-71Google Scholar). This hydrogen bond may help stabilize the upward movement of the N5 atom, which adopts sp 3AzoR is a homodimeric enzyme (1Nakanishi M. Yatome C. Ishida N. Kitade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46394-46399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The redox center FMN is found in the dimer interface, and both monomers contribute to form the two identical catalytic sites (8Ito K. Nakanishi M. Lee W.C. Sasaki H. Zenno S. Saigo K. Kitade Y. Tanokura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20567-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When we refer to one catalytic site, residues will be primed (one monomer) or non-primed (the other monomer), but they areequivalent. NQO1 is also a homodimeric enzyme in a similar fashion to AzoR (36Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Thus, primes will be used in a similar way as with AzoR. hybridization in the reduced state (31Beinert W.D. Ruterjans H. Muller F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The two spherical electron density peaks on FMN, which were also found in the oxidized 1.8 Å resolution structure as reported previously, are currently modeled by water molecules, although they are slightly larger than the electron density peaks of water molecules. The loss of two peaks upon reduction may be attributable to electronic restructuring of the reduced flavin. The Conformational Change of the Isoalloxazine Ring and the Solvent Rearrangement upon Reduction—The butterfly bending direction in reduced AzoR is the opposite of the conformation predicted for reduced free flavin (32Dixon D.A. Lindner D.L. Branchaud B. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5770-5775Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Zheng Y.J. Ornstein R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9402-9408Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Nakai S. Yoneda F. Yamabe T. Theor. Chem. Acc. 1999; 103: 109-116Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This considerable disagreement suggests that the peptide moiety may greatly influence the equilibrium conformation of the isoalloxazine system in AzoR. On the other hand, although it is not clear why the central ring of the isoalloxazine adopts the twist-boat form in the reduced enzyme, which is energetically less favorable than a chair form, this conformation would affect the redox potential of AzoR. In addition, because free oxidized isoalloxazine is planar (35Trus B.L. Fritchie C.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1969; 25: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the twisted form of the oxidized isoalloxazine of AzoR may favor reduction. In the reduced state of the enzyme, the up-moved protonated N5 of the isoalloxazine ring is stabilized by the hydrogen bond with Oδ-1 of Asn-97 through a bridging water molecule (Fig. 1E). The protonation of the N5 of the reduced isoalloxazine ring has been proved biochemically (30Muller F. Muller F Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-71Google Scholar). If methyl red binds to reduced AzoR on top of the isoalloxazine ring as described below, this water molecule must be replaced, resulting in the disruption of the hydrogen bond network. This may cause destabilization of the protonated state of the N5 atom, and a hydride anion would then be released efficiently from the N5 position to an electron acceptor azo compound. Structure of AzoR in Complex with Dicoumarol—Dicoumarol inhibits the azo reduction activity of AzoR (1Nakanishi M. Yatome C. Ishida N. Kitade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46394-46399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To obtain clues to the substrate binding mode, we co-crystallized AzoR with dicoumarol and have determined the structure at 2.3 Å resolution. Although the average completeness of the data of the AzoR-dicoumarol complex is 81.1% (Table 1), there was not any uninterpretable electron density region in model building. The crystal structure shows that dicoumarol is bound to the space above the isoalloxazine ring mainly by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2A). In their interactions, the two coumarin rings of dicoumarol are sandwiched as a result of ring-stacking interactions. The one ring is sandwiched between the phenyl group of Phe-162′ and the isoa"
https://openalex.org/W1992962137,"Background Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue, where it plays an important role in catecholamine-stimulated hydrolysis of stored tri- and diglycerides, thus mobilizing fatty acids. HSL exhibits broad substrate specificity and besides acylglycerides it hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters, retinyl esters and lipoidal esters. Despite its role in fatty acid mobilization, HSL null mice have been shown to be resistant to diet-induced obesity. Methodology/Principal Findings Following a high-fat diet (HFD) regimen, energy expenditure, measured using indirect calorimetry, was increased in HSL null mice. White adipose tissue of HSL null mice was characterized by reduced mass and reduced protein expression of PPARγ, a key transcription factor in adipogenesis, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, the expression of which is known to be positively correlated to the differentiation state of the adipocyte. The protein expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), the highly specific marker of brown adipocytes, was increased 7-fold in white adipose tissue of HSL null mice compared to wildtype littermates. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase in the size of mitochondria of white adipocytes of HSL null mice. The mRNA expression of pRb and RIP140 was decreased in isolated white adipocytes, while the expression of UCP-1 and CPT1 was increased in HSL null mice compared to wildtype littermates. Basal oxygen consumption was increased almost 3-fold in white adipose tissue of HSL null mice and was accompanied by increased uncoupling activity. Conclusions These data suggest that HSL is involved in the determination of white versus brown adipocytes during adipocyte differentiation The exact mechanism(s) underlying this novel role of HSL remains to be elucidated, but it seems clear that HSL is required to sustain normal expression levels of pRb and RIP140, which both promote differentiation into the white, rather than the brown, adipocyte lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1999143684,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) plays an important role in several human cancers. Most current ERalpha antagonists bind in the receptor ligand binding pocket and compete for binding with estrogenic ligands. Instead of the traditional approach of targeting estrogen binding to ER, we describe a strategy using a high throughput fluorescence anisotropy microplate assay to identify small molecule inhibitors of ERalpha binding to consensus estrogen response element (cERE) DNA. We identified small molecule inhibitors of ERalpha binding to the fluorescein-labeled (fl)cERE and evaluated their specificity, potency, and efficacy. One small molecule, theophylline, 8-[(benzylthio)methyl]-(7CI,8CI) (TPBM), inhibited ERalpha binding to the flcERE (IC(50) approximately 3 microm) and inhibited ERalpha-mediated transcription of a stably transfected ERE-containing reporter gene. Inhibition by TPBM was ER-specific, because progesterone and glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity were not significantly inhibited. In tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells that overexpress ERalpha, TPBM inhibited 17beta-estradiol (E(2))-ERalpha (IC(50) 9 microm) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen-ERalpha-mediated gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed TPBM reduced E(2).ERalpha recruitment to an endogenous estrogen-responsive gene. TPBM inhibited E(2)-dependent growth of ERalpha-positive cancer cells (IC(50) of 5 microm). TPBM is not toxic to cells and does not affect estrogen-independent cell growth. TPBM acts outside of the ER ligand binding pocket, does not act by chelating the zinc in ER zinc fingers, and differs from known ERalpha inhibitors. Using a simple high throughput screen for inhibitors of ERalpha binding to the cERE, a small molecule inhibitor has been identified that selectively inhibits ERalpha-mediated gene expression and estrogen-dependent growth of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030933000,"Legionella pneumophila is the predominant cause of Legionnaires disease, a severe and potentially fatal form of pneumonia. Recently, we identified an ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase) from L. pneumophila, termed Lpg1905, which enhances intracellular replication of L. pneumophila in eukaryotic cells. Lpg1905 is the first prokaryotic member of the CD39/NTPDase1 family of enzymes, which are characterized by the presence of five apyrase conserved regions and the ability to hydrolyze nucleoside tri- and diphosphates. Here we examined the substrate specificity of Lpg1905 and showed that apart from ATP and ADP, the enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of GTP and GDP but had limited activity against CTP, CDP, UTP, and UDP. Based on amino acid residues conserved in the apyrase conserved regions of eukaryotic NTPDases, we generated five site-directed mutants, Lpg1905E159A, R122A, N168A, Q193A, and W384A. Although the mutations E159A, R122A, Q193A, and W384A abrogated activity completely, N168A resulted in decreased activity caused by reduced affinity for nucleotides. When introduced into the lpg1905 mutant strain of L. pneumophila, only N168A partially restored the ability of L. pneumophila to replicate in THP-1 macrophages. Following intratracheal inoculation of A/J mice, none of the Lpg1905 mutants was able to restore virulence to an lpg1905 mutant during lung infection, thereby demonstrating the importance of NTPDase activity to L. pneumophila infection. Overall, the kinetic studies undertaken here demonstrated important differences to mammalian NTPDases and different sensitivities to NTPDase inhibitors that may reflect underlying structural variations."
https://openalex.org/W2160427234,"Glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD-Ib) is caused by deficiencies in the glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) transporter (G6PT) that have been well characterized. Interestingly, deleterious mutations in the G6PT gene were identified in clinical cases of GSD type Ic (GSD-Ic) proposed to be deficient in an inorganic phosphate (P(i)) transporter. We hypothesized that G6PT is both the G6P and P(i) transporter. Using reconstituted proteoliposomes we show that both G6P and P(i) are efficiently taken up into P(i)-loaded G6PT-proteoliposomes. The G6P uptake activity decreases as the internal:external P(i) ratio decreases and the P(i) uptake activity decreases in the presence of external G6P. Moreover, G6P or P(i) uptake activity is not detectable in P(i)-loaded proteoliposomes containing the p.R28H G6PT null mutant. The G6PT-proteoliposome-mediated G6P or P(i) uptake is inhibited by cholorgenic acid and vanadate, both specific G6PT inhibitors. Glucose-6-phosphatase-alpha (G6Pase-alpha), which facilitates microsomal G6P uptake by G6PT, fails to stimulate G6P uptake in P(i)-loaded G6PT-proteoliposomes, suggesting that the G6Pase-alpha-mediated stimulation is caused by decreasing G6P and increasing P(i) concentrations in microsomes. Taken together, our results suggest that G6PT has a dual role as a G6P and a P(i) transporter and that GSD-Ib and GSD-Ic are deficient in the same G6PT gene."
https://openalex.org/W2033595008,"The RNA degradosome of Escherichia coli is a multiprotein complex that plays an essential role in normal RNA processing and decay. It was recently shown that the major degradosome constituents are organized in a coiled cytoskeletal-like structure that extends along the length of the cell. Here we show that the endoribonuclease E (RNaseE) and RNA helicase B (RhlB) components of the degradosome can each independently form coiled structures in the absence of the other degradosome proteins. In contrast, the cytoskeletal organization of the other degradosome proteins required the presence of the RNaseE or RhlB coiled elements. Although the RNaseE and RhlB structures were equally competent to support the helical organization of polynucleotide phosphorylase, the cytoskeletal-like organization of enolase occurred only in the presence of the RNaseE coiled structure. The results indicate that the RNA degradosome proteins are components of the bacterial cytoskeleton rather than existing as randomly distributed multiprotein complexes within the cell and suggest a model for the cellular organization of the components within the helical degradosomal structure."
https://openalex.org/W1975554671,"Brain-specific kinases 1 and 2 (BRSK1/2) are AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related kinases that are highly expressed in mammalian forebrain. Studies using transgenic animal models have implicated a role for these kinases in the establishment of neuronal polarity. BRSK1 and BRSK2 are activated by phosphorylation of a threonine residue in the T-loop activation segment of the kinase domain. In vitro studies have demonstrated that LKB1, an upstream kinase in the AMPK cascade, can catalyze this phosphorylation. However, to date, a detailed comparative analysis of the molecular regulation of BRSK1/2 has not been undertaken.

We show that equivalent mutations in the ubiquitin-associated domains of the BRSK isoforms produce differential effects on the activation of BRSK1 and BRSK2. Contrary to previous reports, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase does not affect BRSK1 or BRSK2 activity in mammalian cells. Furthermore, stimuli that activate AMPK had no effect on BRSK1/2.

BRSK1 and BRSK2 are evolutionarily conserved, and orthologs exist in mice, Caenorhabditis elegans (SAD-1), Drosophila (CG6114), and ascidians (HrPOPK-1). Initial studies using sad-1 mutants in C. elegans identified a function for the kinase in regulating synaptic vesicle distribution and development of normal synapses (2Crump J.G. Zhen M. Jin Y. Bargmann C.I. Neuron. 2001; 29: 115-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Subsequently, BRSK1 has been shown to localize to and associate with synaptic vesicles in mouse hippocampus and cerebellum as well as in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons (3Inoue E. Mochida S.

Knock-out mice that lack both BRSK1 and BRSK2 have defects in neuronal polarity and die at ∼2 h after birth (4Kishi M. Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R. Science. 2005; 307: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Embryos from the knock-out mice have visibly thinner cortices when compared with control mice due to disordered subplate layers, and neurons lack distinct axonal and dendritic processes. Information regarding the potential downstream targets for BRSK1/2 is very limited; however, a number of AMPK-related kinases, including BRSK1 and BRSK2, phosphorylate tau, a microtubule-associated protein that regulates stability of the microtubule network (4Kishi M. Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R. Science. 2005; 307: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of tau may contribute to the polarity phenotype observed in the BRSK1/2 knock-out mice.

Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Recently, a mouse model was generated in which deletion of the LKB1 gene was limited to pyramidal neurons of the cortex (9Barnes A.P. Lilley B.N. Pan Y.A. Plummer L.J. Powell A.W. Raines A.N. Sanes J.R. Polleux F. Cell. 2007; 129: 549-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Although the cortex of these transgenic animals was normal in overall size, the ventricles were larger and the cortical wall thinner when compared with control animals. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed a lack of cortical axons in the LKB1-deficient mice and a phenotype similar to the BRSK1/2 double knock-out mice (4Kishi M. Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R. Science. 2005; 307: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In another study, down-regulation of LKB1 and STRAD using siRNAs prevented axon differentiation, whereas overexpression of these proteins led to multiple axon formation (10Shelly M. Cancedda L. Heilshorn S. Sumbre G. Poo M.M. Cell. 2007; 129: 565-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that LKB1 is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at serine 431 in the mouse protein (equivalent to serine 428 in the human sequence), although phosphorylation at this residue had no detectable effect on LKB1 activity (11Collins S.P.

Although transgenic animal studies indicate an essential role for BRSK1 and BRSK2 in neuronal development, a detailed assessment of the molecular basis for their regulation has not been reported. Here, we present data characterizing the regulation of BRSK1 and BRSK2 by phosphorylation. We find that in contrast to LKB1, CaMKKβ does not activate BRSK1 or BRSK2 in mammalian cells. We show that an equivalent mutation within the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains of BRSK1 and BRSK2 has differential effects on their activity. We found that PKA does not directly regulate the activity, or activation by LKB1, of BRSK1 or BRSK2. In addition, a number of stimuli that lead to activation of AMPK in mammalian cells have no effect on the activity of BRSK1/2. Finally, we present data examining the role of protein phosphatases on the regulation of BRSK1/2.

BRSK2 was immunoprecipitated from SH-SY5Y lysates (100 μg) and activity measured by LNR substrate assay (A). SH-SY5Y cells were treated with okadaic acid (200 nm, 45 min), and BRSK2 activity was determined as above (B).

Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Protein content was determined by a Bradford assay (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Tissue Lysates—Mouse tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was used for further analysis. Antibody Production—Glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of full-length BRSK2 was generated and used to immunize rabbits. Western Blotting—Samples (30–50 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skimmed milk and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated in secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen) or IRDye800 (LI-COR) and scanned on the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system using Odyssey software 2.0 for band quantification. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged BRSK1 was detected using an anti-HA polyclonal antibody (AbCam), Myc-tagged BRSK2 was detected using an anti-Myc antibody (9B11, Cell Signaling), and CaMKKβ was detected using an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Additional antibodies used were anti-BRSK1 (AbCam), anti-LKB1 (Ley37D/G6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-CREB (Ser-133; 87G3, Cell Signaling), anti-CREB (Sigma), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (AbCam). Dephosphorylation of BRSK2—BRSK2 was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of cell lysate by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads coupled to anti-Myc antibody. Immune complexes were incubated with recombinant PP2Cα (14Marley A.E. Sullivan J.E. Carling D. Abbott W.M. Smith G.J. Taylor I.W. Carey F. Beri R.K. Biochem.

Assay of BRSK Activity—BRSK1/2 activity was measured by phosphorylation of the LNR peptide substrate (KKLNRTLSFA-EPG (15Ross H. Armstrong C.G. Cohen P. Biochem.

BRSK1/2 was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of cell lysate by incubation with protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose beads coupled to anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody, respectively, for 2 h at 4 °C. Following extensive washing with Buffer A, the immune complexes were incubated with 0.5 mm LNR and 0.2 mm [γ32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 in Buffer A for 20 min at 37 °C. Radioactivity incorporated into the LNR peptide was determined by filter assay using phosphocellulose P-81 filter squares. Endogenous AMPK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using an anti-pan-β AMPK antibody (16Woods A. Salt I. Scott J. Hardie D.G. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and AMPK activity was measured by phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide (17Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J.

Statistical significance was established by Studentŉs t test. Data were considered significant at p < 0.05. Expression of BRSK1 and BRSK2 in Mouse Tissues—Previous studies have demonstrated that BRSK1 and BRSK2 are expressed predominantly in the brain (3Inoue E. Mochida S. Takagi H. Higa S. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue M. Yao I. Takeuchi K. Kitajima I. Setou M. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y.

Science. 2005; 307: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recently, however, expression of both BRSK1 and BRSK2 was reported in pancreas (18Hezel A.F. Gurumurthy S. Granot Z. Swisa A. Chu G.C. Bailey G. Dor Y. Bardeesy N. De Pinho R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2414-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since none of the previous studies compared the relative expression of BRSK isoforms, we determined expression and activity of BRSK1 and BRSK2 in the brain and pancreas (Fig. 1). As judged by Western blotting, both BRSK1 and BRSK2 were highly expressed in brain, with low level expression of BRSK2 in pancreas. However, we were unable to detect expression of BRSK1 in pancreas. Neither BRSK1 nor BRSK2 expression was detected in liver nor in any other tissues we examined (data not shown). Consistent with the protein expression, the activity of both BRSK1 and BRSK2 was readily detected in immune complexes isolated from brain. Low, but significant, activity of both isoforms was also detectable in pancreas. No activity was detected in other tissues, including liver. LKB1 but Not CaMKKβ Activates BRSK Activity—To begin characterizing the regulation by upstream kinases, we transfected CCL13 cells with BRSK1 and BRSK2. As CCL13 do not express LKB1 (7Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2004-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar), we manipulated the levels of LKB1 expression using an adenoviral delivery system (Fig. 2A and B, bottom panels). In the absence of LKB1 expression, virtually no activity was detected for either BRSK1 or BRSK2. Increasing levels of LKB1 expression (as judged by Western blotting) resulted in increasing levels of BRSK1 and BRSK2 activity, in the absence of any additional stimuli (Fig. 2, A and B). Increasing the dosage of LKB1 beyond 10 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell did not increase BRSK1 or BRSK2 activity further (data not shown). Expression of LKB1 had no obvious effect on the level of expression of either BRSK1 or BRSK2, as judged by Western blotting. To confirm that BRSK2 activation required phosphorylation of Thr-174 within the T-loop activation domain (1Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), we expressed a mutant construct of BRSK2 in which threonine 174 was mutated to alanine (T174A). No activation of this mutant form of BRSK2 was observed, even at the highest concentration of LKB1, confirming that this residue is critical for kinase activity of BRSK2. Mutation of Thr-174 to alanine had no detectable effect on expression of BRSK2 (Fig. 2B). However, Western blot analysis of BRSK2 revealed the presence of a distinct doublet. This doublet corresponds to BRSK2 since the bands are only detected following expression of BRSK2. Although we have been unable to determine the reason for BRSK2 migrating as a doublet on SDS-PAGE, it appears to be related to the activation state of BRSK2 since the intensity of the slower migrating form diminishes in parallel with activation. A doublet is also detected for the T174A mutant, although in this case, the relative intensities do not change following expression of LKB1 (Fig. 2B). In addition to LKB1, AMPK has been shown to be phosphorylated and activated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ (19Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Mustard K.J. Ross L. Bain J.

Increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels lead to activation of AMPK through a CaMKKβ-mediated pathway (19Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Mustard K.J. Ross L. Bain J. Edelman A.M. Frenguelli B.G. Hardie D.G.

Med. 2006; 203: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether CaMKKβ activates BRSK1/2, we co-expressed either BRSK1 or BRSK2 with CaMKKβ in CCL13 cells and determined BRSK activity. We were unable to detect any activity for either BRSK1 or BRSK2 following expression of CaMKKβ, despite significant activation of endogenous AMPK (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that although there is a high degree of conservation surrounding the T-loop residue within AMPK and BRSK1/2, CaMKKβ is not capable of phosphorylating and activating BRSK1 or BRSK2. Role of T-loop Phosphorylation and UBA Domain on BRSK1 and BRSK2 Activity—As demonstrated by us and others (1Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of threonine 174 is essential for activation of BRSK2. The sequence surrounding the equivalent threonine residue in BRSK1 (Thr-189) is identical to that in BRSK2, and a previous study reported that phosphorylation of Thr-189 is essential for BRSK1 activity (1Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). In that same study, it was reported that mutation of the T-loop residue to glutamic acid led to a constitutively active form of the kinase expressed in Escherichia coli (1Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). We generated the T174E mutant for BRSK2 and expressed it in CCL13 cells. Irrespective of LKB1 expression, BRSK2 activity of this mutant was ∼15% of the activated, wild-type kinase (Fig. 3A). Our results suggest that the glutamic acid substitution is not sufficient for maximal activity of BRSK2 in mammalian cells. A number of the AMPK-related kinases, including BRSK1 and BRSK2, contain a UBA domain, immediately C-terminal to the kinase domain (24Jaleel M. Villa F. Deak M. Toth R. Prescott A.R. Van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The precise function of these domains in the AMPK-related kinases is unclear, although some studies have suggested that they may play a role in the stability of the kinase domain (24Jaleel M. Villa F. Deak M. Toth R. Prescott A.R. Van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Murphy J.M. Korzhnev D.M. Ceccarelli D.F. Briant D.J.

In addition, there is evidence that the presence of the UBA domains is required for phosphorylation and activation by LKB1 (24Jaleel M. Villa F. Deak M. Toth R. Prescott A.R. Van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the UBA domain on BRSK activity, we generated constructs for expression of BRSK1 and BRSK2 harboring a mutation of a glycine to alanine residue (Gly-343 in BRSK1, Gly-310 in BRSK2) within the UBA domain. These glycine residues are conserved throughout the AMPK-related kinase family and have been identified previously as critical for UBA function (26Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The G343A mutation almost completely abolished activation of BRSK1 by LKB1 (Fig. 3B) without significantly affecting the level of expression of BRSK1. In contrast, although the G343A mutation reduced BRSK2 activity, there was still significant activation of the mutant form of the kinase, which increased following increasing expression of LKB1 (Fig. 3C). At the maximum level of LKB1 expression (10 pfu/cell), BRSK1 G343A activity was less than 10% of the wild-type activity, whereas BRSK2 G310A was 30% of wild type. These results suggest that a functional UBA domain is not as essential for BRSK2 activity, or phosphorylation by LKB1, as it is for BRSK1 activation.

However, complete differentiation and/or trans-differentiation into cardiomyocytes have never occurred in these transplant studies, whereas functional contributions were reported.Skeletal muscle interstitium-derived CD34(+)/CD45(-) (Sk-34) cells were purified from green fluorescent protein transgenic mice by flowcytometory. Cardiac differentiation of Sk-34 cells was examined by in vitro clonal culture and co-culture with embryonic cardiomyocytes, and in vivo transplantation into a nude rat myocardial infarction (MI) model (left ventricle). Lower relative expression of cardiomyogenic transcription factors, such as GATA-4, Nkx2-5, Isl-1, Mef2 and Hand2, was seen in clonal cell culture. However, vigorous expression of these factors was seen on co-culture with embryonic cardiomyocytes, together with formation of gap-junctions and synchronous contraction following sphere-like colony formation. At 4 weeks after transplantation of freshly isolated Sk-34 cells, donor cells exhibited typical cardiomyocyte structure with formation of gap-junctions, as well as intercalated discs and desmosomes, between donor and recipient and/or donor and donor cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis detecting the rat and mouse genomic DNA and immunoelectron microscopy using anti-GFP revealed donor-derived cells. Transplanted Sk-34 cells were incorporated into infarcted portions of recipient muscles and contributed to cardiac reconstitution. Significant improvement in left ventricular function, as evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography and micro-tip conductance catheter, was also observed.Skeletal muscle-derived multipotent Sk-34 cells that can give rise to skeletal and smooth muscle cells as reported previously, also give rise to cardiac muscle cells as multi-myogenic stem cells, and thus are a potential source for practical cellular cardiomyoplasty."

The three-dimensional structure of E. coli RNase II was recently determined (23Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M.

The E. coli RNase II structure and its RNA-bound complex have been used as a model for the analysis of Dis3/Rrp44 (20Schneider C. Anderson J.T. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). RNase II consists of four domains (Fig. 1A): two N-terminal cold shock domains (CSD1 and CSD2), one central RNB catalytic domain, and one C-terminal S1 domain. The RNA contacts the enzyme at two different and non-contiguous regions, the anchoring and the catalytic regions, which act synergistically to provide a processive degradation. Nucleotides 1 to 5 are located in the anchor region, situated in a deep cleft between the two cold shock domains and the S1 domain (Fig. 1A). The catalytic region forms a cavity that is only accessible to single-stranded RNA, where the last five nucleotides at the 3′-end of the RNA molecule (nt 9–13) are stacked and clamped between the aromatic residues Tyr-253 and Phe-358. In a recent report (23Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) we postulated a model for RNA degradation that involves one Mg2+ ion, four highly conserved aspartic acids (201, 207, 209, and 210), and the recruitment of a second Mg2+ for catalysis. In this study we mutated these highly conserved amino acids present in the active site and characterized the respective proteins. Here, we also show, for the first time, the models of two related members of the RNase II family, RNase R from E. coli and human Rrp44 (Fig. 1, B and C). These results shed new light on the mechanism of RNA degradation by RNase II and can therefore be important for comprehension of the mode of action of other members of the RNase II family. Construction of RNase II Mutants by Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations D207N, D210N, F358A, and Y253A,F358A were introduced into pFCT6.9 (5Cairrão F. Chora A. Zilhão R. Carpousis J. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 276: 19172-19181Google Scholar) by PCR overlapping (26Higuchi, R. (1990) in PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications (Innis, M. A., Gelfand, D. H., Sninsky, J.

D201N and Y253A mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The primers used in this study are described in supplemental experimental procedures. Overexpression and Purification of Wild-type and RNase II Mutants—The plasmid used for expression of wild-type E. coli histidine-tagged RNase II protein was pFCT6.9 plasmid (5Cairrão F. Chora A. Zilhão R. Carpousis J. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 276: 19172-19181Google Scholar). All other plasmids bearing mutations were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli strain (Novagen) to allow the expression of the recombinant proteins. Purification of all proteins was performed by histidine affinity chromatography using HiTrap Chelating HP columns (GE Healthcare) and the AKTA HLPC system (GE Healthcare) following the protocol previously described (13Amblar M. Barbas A. Fialho A.M. Arraiano C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzymes was analyzed in an 8% SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). Activity Assays—Exoribonucleolytic activity was assayed using oligoribonucleotides as substrate (13Amblar M. Barbas A. Fialho A.M. Arraiano C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 30-mer oligoribonucleotide (5′-CCCGACACCAACCACUAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-3′) and the poly(A) chain of 35 nt were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The RNA oligomers were then purified using Microcon YM-3 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore). Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 10 μl containing 30 nm substrate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The amount of each enzyme added to the reaction was adjusted to obtain linear conditions and is indicated in Fig. 2. Reactions were started by the addition of the enzyme and incubated at 37 °C. Samples were withdrawn at the time points indicated in the figure, and the reaction was stopped by adding formamide-containing dye supplemented with 10 mm EDTA. Reaction products were resolved in 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea and analyzed by autoradiography. The exoribonucleolytic activity of the enzymes was determined by measuring and quantifying the disappearance of the substrate in three distinct experiments; each value obtained represents the mean of these independent assays (supplemental Fig. S2). The exoribonucleolytic activity of the wild-type enzyme was taken as 100%. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis, Biacore—Biacore SA streptavidin chips were obtained from Biacore Inc. (GE Healthcare). The flow cells of the SA streptavidin sensor chip were coated with a low concentration of the substrates as described in supplemental experimental procedures. The biosensor assay was run at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm EDTA. The target RNA substrate was captured on flow cell 2, and the pure proteins were injected as indicated in supplemental experimental procedures. All experiments included triple injections of each protein concentration (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 nm) to determine the reproducibility of the signal and to control injections to assess the stability of the RNA surface during the experiment. Dissociation constants were calculated using the BIA Evaluation 3.0 software package, according to the fitting model 1:1 Languimir binding. Modeling of RNase R and Rrp44 Protein Structures—Three-dimensional models for E. coli RNase R (RNR_ECOLI) and human exosome complex exonuclease Rrp44 (Rrp44_HUMAN) proteins were performed using standard homology modeling methods based on the multiple sequence alignment of the family members, as described in supplemental experimental procedures. MD Simulation of 2ix1 Structure; Modeling of Wild-type Enzyme and Y253A Mutant—To obtain a theoretical dynamic model of RNase enzyme, the previously published x-ray structure of RNase II D209N mutant complexed with a 10-nt poly(A) RNA (Protein Data Bank code 2IX1) (23Frazão C.

Re-creation was performed using the PMEMD module and the parm99 parameter set in the AMBER 8 package (27Case D.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A.

University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). Based on the resultant in silico structure of the mutant, models for wild-type enzyme as well as for Y253A mutant were also generated by substituting appropriate residues using standard homology modeling procedures. Both structures were then subjected to a second MD running to simulate the possible modifications in the protein arrangement and its relationship to the substrate RNA as a result of the introduced changes. Details on the MD method are described in supplemental experimental procedures. Multiple Sequence Alignment—Homologous sequences belonging to the RNase II, RNase R, and Rrp44 family of proteins were obtained in protein data bases using BLAST (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59888) Google Scholar) and were aligned using ClustalW (30Thompson J.D.

Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5469) Google Scholar) algorithms. Mutations in the Aromatic Residues That Clamp the RNA Can Alter the End Products—To further determine the role of Tyr-253 and Phe-358 in RNA decay, we mutated these aromatic residues into an alanine and constructed single (Y253A or F358A) and double (Y253A,F358A) mutants. In RNase II the RNA molecule (nt 9–13) is stacked and clamped between the aromatic residues Tyr-253 and Phe-358. Based on structure, we would predict that RNase II would be inactive in the absence of Tyr-253, because the unclamping of the RNA at the active site would disrupt the correct conformation of the substrate, thus impairing catalysis. However, by changing Tyr-253 to Ala 26% of the activity of the enzyme persisted (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Dynamic models built from the crystallographic structure of the RNase II-RNA complex reveal that, in fact, Tyr-253 remains firmly stacked to the putative outgoing nt 13 by its respective aromatic system, even after 4 ns of molecular dynamics simulation and despite the anti to syn conformational change exhibited by the adenine nucleotide (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3). This result supports that Tyr-253 is actually important for the maintenance of the RNA clamping in RNase II. However, despite its conservation, there must be other residues and contacts at the catalytic cavity that are sufficient for the RNA to bind to the protein. In fact, Phe-250 and Phe-257 residues, located in close vicinity to Tyr-253, could presumably account for such a role, although the corresponding model would require a conformational reorganization of the protein backbone around these positions. Nevertheless, the most surprising result was that the Y253A mutant changed the smallest product of degradation of RNase II from 4 to 10 nt (Fig. 2), an end product not observed before. It is known that for a processive degradation by RNase II the RNA molecule must bind simultaneously to the anchoring and catalytic regions (14Cannistraro V.J. Kennell D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 930-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Moreover, the three-dimensional model of the RNase II-RNA complex revealed that a 10-nt fragment is the minimum length of the RNA molecule that is still able to contact both the anchoring and the catalytic regions (23Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). RNA molecules shorter than 10 nt only establish interactions with the catalytic region, and consequently degradation becomes distributive. In Y253A the absence of Tyr-253 may cause the loosening of the RNA substrate at the catalytic site and, as a consequence, the binding at the anchoring region is essential for the RNA to remain attached to the enzyme. For this reason, RNA is degraded up to 10 nt and the RNA fragment is then released from the enzyme, being therefore the smallest degradation product generated in the Y253A mutant. As such, Tyr-253 must play an essential role in the attachment of the 3′-end of the RNA substrate to the catalytic region. In agreement, the KD value obtained for Y253A by surface plasmon resonance analysis is 5.5-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S4), and this shows that Y253A substitution significantly impaired RNA binding. Moreover, the modeled structures of Y253A show that, once the Tyr-253-nt 13 stacking is lost, the RNA suffers a large rearrangement, coordinated by corresponding counter movements of contacting RNase II catalytic domain structure (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3B). Surprisingly, these movements do not appear to affect directly the geometry of the Asp residues in the active center, thus explaining the remaining catalytic activity of the Y253A mutant.TABLE 1Exoribonucleolytic activity and RNA binding affinity of wild-type and mutant enzymes Exoribonucleolytic activity was assayed using a 35-nt poly(A) chain as substrate.

The determination of the enzyme exoribonucleolytic activity was carried out by measuring and quantifying the disappearance of the substrate Open table in a new tab When analyzing the F358A mutant we found that, unexpectedly, the protein was 2-fold more active than the wild-type (Table 1). Although the smallest degradation product detected was 4 nt, similar to the wild-type, there was a visible product of 5 nt (Fig. 2). This may suggest that Phe-358 is acting as a “propeller,” helping to push the last 5 nt toward the catalytic site, until the final product is a 4-nt fragment. However, the KD was not dramatically affected by this mutation because it was <2-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that Phe-358 may be playing a more accessory role in the maintenance of the proper RNA conformation. This hypothesis was confirmed by MD of the structure, which contrary to the data revealed by the three-dimensional structure suggests that the dynamic stability of the Phe-358 stacking could be compromised in the simulation conditions in the general AMBER force field (27Case D.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6565) Google Scholar, 28Case D.A.

Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Kollman P.A. AMBER 8. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in accordance with the experimental results obtained for the F358A mutant, a less active structural role of this residue during catalysis could still be compatible with the real structural data. Therefore, Phe-358 is not equivalent in function to Tyr-253 and, unlike the latter, Phe-358 is not present in all members of the RNase II family (supplemental Fig. S5). Computational models also support that the structural role of these residues in RNA stabilization could also be quite different. Tyr-253 would be responsible for the stacking-mediated stabilization of the outgoing nucleotide at the 3′-end during catalysis (Fig. 3A), while the partially conserved Phe-358 position could mediate the transition of the RNA by providing the appropriate hydrophobic environment to prevent spurious contacts. In turn, substitution by a smaller hydrophobic residue, such as alanine, could modify the RNA stability in that region, thus biasing the rate of processing. The double mutant Y253A,F358A behaved similar to Y253A regarding the size of the smallest product generated, because the end product obtained was 13–15 nt (Fig. 2). However, we detected a decrease in activity (12 versus 26%) although the RNA binding affinity was not significantly affected (KD = 5.1 ± 0.1 nm) (Table 1). Therefore, it seems that the F358A mutation may somehow compensate the absence of Tyr-253 in RNA binding, perhaps allowing an alternative accommodation of the RNA in the catalytic cavity. To compare RNase II with other family members, we constructed the structural models of E. coli RNase R and human Rrp44 proteins based on the RNase II structure (Fig. 1, B and C). The results clearly indicate that these three enzymes share a common three-dimensional arrangement, being all the critical residues for exoribonucleolytic activity located in equivalent spatial positions. Comparing the three protein models (Fig. 1), it is noteworthy that they have a common arrangement of the clamping tyrosine amino acid. In contrast, the presence of Phe-358 is exclusive to RNase II (supplemental Fig. S5). RNase R protein presents a Phe residue in the immediate downstream position (Phe-429 in RNR_ECOLI sequence), perhaps with a similar functionality in RNA fixing. However, an equivalent residue is completely absent in Rrp44 sequences, where it is substituted mainly by polar residues with uncharged R-groups (Asn and Thr) (supplemental Fig. S5). The differences in the equivalent amino acid Phe-358 in RNase II, RNase R, and Rrp44 enzymes could explain their differences in regard to RNA degradation. For instance, the final end product of both RNase II and Rrp44 is 4 nt, whereas for RNase R it is a 2-nt fragment (2Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D.

The Highly Conserved Aspartates in RNase II Active Site Are Not Equivalent in Their Role in Catalysis—Four highly conserved aspartic acids, Asp-201, Asp-207, Asp-209, and Asp-210, are located in the RNase II active site. It has been postulated that their function is to position the RNA substrate correctly and promote the nucleophilic attack of the phosphodiester bond (23Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 32Amblar M. Arraiano C.M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The single substitution of Asp-209 by Asn in RNase II (D209N) has been shown to be responsible for the total loss of RNase II activity without affecting RNA binding ability (32Amblar M. Arraiano C.M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Table 1 and Fig. 2). A similar mutation in the yeast RNase II homologue Dis3/Rrp44 (D551N) totally abolished activity without reducing substrate binding and was responsible for a very strong growth defect, suggesting that the phenotype of this mutant is very important for yeast physiology (19Dziembowski A. Lorentzen E. Conti E. Seraphin B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 20Schneider C. Anderson J.T. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To understand the precise role of these residues, we mutated residues Asp-201, Asp-207, and Asp-210 to asparagines. Our results revealed that mutations in both Asp-201 and Asp-210 lead to a significant loss of activity in degradation of poly(A) (0.2 and 0.3% of that of the wild-type enzyme, respectively) (Table 1). Aspartates 201 and 210 were proposed to be coordinating the Mg2+ ion that is essential for catalysis together with two water molecules and two oxygen atoms of the RNA substrate (23Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The substitution of these aspartates by asparagines would result in the loss of one of the coordinations, thus destabilizing the cation at the active site and impairing the reaction. Similar reduction in activity was observed with the 30 single-stranded substrate (Fig. 2B). Both D201N and D210N mutants generated a 10–11-nt fragment as a major degradation product, although longer reaction times resulted in the usual 4-nt fragment as a secondary product (Fig. 2A). The absence of these aspartates may destabilize the attachment of the RNA at the catalytic site, because both residues are contributing to the binding of the RNA at this region, either directly (by Asp-201) or through the Mg2+ ion they chelate (Asp-201 and Asp-210) (23Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As such, fragments below 10 nt in length, when the binding of the substrate to the anchor region is no longer possible, lead to a distributive degradation, explaining this destabilization. Interestingly, the degradation of the 30 single-stranded seems to stop after digestion of 15–16 nt, thus generating a 14–15-nt fragment as a final product (Fig. 2B). This substrate contains a 16-nt poly(A) tail at its 3′-end, and both D201N and D210N mutant enzymes degrade this tail to completion and then stop. This effect reflects a marked preference by poly(A) substrate that has also been observed in the wild-type enzyme (13Amblar M. Barbas A. Fialho A.M. Arraiano C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Cannistraro V.J. Kennell D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 930-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Amblar M. Barbas A. Gomez-Puertas P. Arraiano C.M. RNA (N.Y.). 2007; 13: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) but seems to be more pronounced in these two mutants. The role of Asp-207 does not seem to be so critical for catalysis when compared with the other mutants because after its substitution by asparagine the enzyme still retains 12% activity (Table 1 and Fig. 2). This result differs from previously published data in which the mutation of Asp-207 to alanine led to a more significant loss of activity (2.5% of that of the wild-type enzyme) (25Zuo Y. Vincent H.A. Zhang J. Wang Y. Deutscher M.P. Malhotra A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the substitution of an aspartate by alanine may cause local conformational changes other than those generated by the substitution by asparagine in which only the acidic nature of the residue is altered. The structure of the RNase II D209N mutant revealed that Asp-207 is within H-bonding distance of the 3′-OH group of the RNA molecule (Fig. 3B). In contrast, after molecular dynamics equilibration during 4 ns, this close contact apparently disappeared and Asp-207 was then positioned in contact with the Mg2+ ion in the active center via its backbone CO group (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, when the wild-type protein was modeled and subjected again to molecular dynamics processes, Asp-209 was located in contact with the Mg2+ atom, in the active center, resulting in the displacement of Asp-207 to a far position (Fig. 3B). As a result of this analysis, Asp-207 does not appear to play such a critical role. Perhaps it only contributes to the general maintenance of the appropriate position of both water and ions, which explains in part the remaining activity of D207N. As expected, D209N was totally inactive in the degradation of the two substrates tested (Table 1 and Fig. 2), reinforcing the key role of Asp-209 in catalysis. In the three mutant proteins D201N, D207N, and D210N, the KD ranged between 11 and 14 nm, only 2-fold higher than the wild-type RNase II enzyme (Table 1), thus showing only a slight reduction in the RNA binding affinity. Therefore it seems that aspartates 201, 207, and 210 are not directly involved in the RNA binding (Table 1). In fact, in the crystal structure these three residues interact with the RNA substrate at the active site via the Mg2+ ion or by being directly bound to the leaving nucleotide (23Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Disruption of such interactions by these mutations would cause the loosening of the RNA at the active site. Moreover, the three-dimensional models of E. coli RNase R and human Rrp44 proteins (Fig. 1, B and C) revealed that these four aspartic residues have spatial positions equivalent to those in RNase II. Therefore, we can propose similar catalytic roles for these residues in these two RNase II-like enzymes. In this report we have improved the proposed model for RNA degradation by RNase II by defining the precise role and function of some highly conserved residues present in the active site of the enzyme. We conclude that Tyr-253 and Phe-358 are not essential for catalysis by RNase II, because the enzyme still retains activity after the substitution of these residues by alanines. However, Tyr-253 seems to be a critical residue in setting the smallest product generated by RNase II under the conditions tested. This accentuates the importance of this residue in the stabilization of the 3′-end of the RNA molecule. Tyr-253 is highly conserved and equivalent residues are present in many RNase II family members (supplemental Fig. S5). Taking into account the functional and structural similarities to Rrp44 (20Schneider C. Anderson J.T. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), these conclusions will be particularly important for the evaluation of the role of this residue in recognition, binding, and degradation of different RNA targets. The substitution of Phe-358 results in the increase by 2-fold of the activity of the enzyme. This result suggests that Phe-358 could be preventing a faster degradation of the RNA by stalling its translocation, probably due to the stacking of its aromatic ring between the bases of contiguous nucleotides. Furthermore, we show that the highly conserved aspartates Asp-201, Asp-207, Asp-209, and Asp-210 are not equivalent and that their functions in RNA metabolism are distinct, with Asp-209 being the only residue essential for RNase II activity. Moreover, the structural models of E. coli RNase R and human Rrp44 proteins showed an overall structure similar to that of the RNase II, with the critical residues in similar spatial positions. In addition, the structure of yeast Rrp44 showed that E. coli RNase II is a good model and suggests that the RNA recruitment mechanism is conserved. As such, we can hypothesize and extrapolate our findings to related members of the RNase II family. This study sheds new light on the model previously proposed for RNA degradation by RNase II. In addition, the fact that the RNase II homologue is the only catalytically active nuclease in the exosome highlights the need to unravel the precise role of highly conserved residues. Finally, these results can be applied to better understand the decay mechanisms for all RNase II family members that have revealed a similar mode of action, including those present in the exosome.

Activation of ATM/ATR triggers cell cycle checkpoint activation and adaptive responses to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that protein ubiquitylation or degradation plays an important role in the DNA damage response. In this study, we examined the potential role of the proteasome in checkpoint activation and ATM/ATR signaling in response to UV light-induced DNA damage. HeLa cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 showed delayed phosphorylation of ATM substrates in response to UV light. UV light-induced phosphorylation of 53BP1, as well as its recruitment to DNA damage foci, was strongly suppressed by proteasome inhibition, whereas the recruitment of upstream regulators of 53BP1, including MDC1 and H2AX, was unaffected. The ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase RNF8 was critical for 53BP1 focus targeting and phosphorylation in ionizing radiation-damaged cells, whereas UV light-induced 53BP1 phosphorylation and targeting exhibited partial dependence on RNF8 and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13. Suppression of RNF8 or UBC13 also led to subtle defects in UV light-induced G2/M checkpoint activation. These findings are consistent with a model in which RNF8 ubiquitylation pathways are essential for 53BP1 regulation in response to ionizing radiation, whereas RNF8-independent pathways contribute to 53BP1 targeting and phosphorylation in response to UV light and potentially other forms of DNA replication stress.

DNA-damaging stimuli elicit highly conserved responses in eukaryotic cells that are required for the maintenance of genomic integrity and organismal viability. Protein kinase cascades are central to the DNA damage-signaling paradigm, and members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase gene superfamily play particularly important roles as apical DNA damage response regulators. Two functionally related members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase family, the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ATM-Rad3-related) kinases, initiate overlapping signaling pathways in response to distinct types of genetic lesions. ATM is principally activated by ionizing radiation (IR) 2The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HU, hydroxyurea; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Gy, gray; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. 2The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HU, hydroxyurea; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Gy, gray; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. and other agents that induce DNA double-strand breaks, whereas ATR responds to pauses in DNA replication that transiently expose single-strand DNA (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Once activated, ATM and ATR phosphorylate and activate the CHK2 and CHK1 protein kinases, respectively, which in turn promote cell cycle checkpoint arrest through inhibition of CDC25 family phosphatases (2Liu Q.

ATM and ATR phosphorylate numerous other substrates, including p53 and BRCA1, which participate in DNA metabolism. The regulatory reach of ATM and ATR extends to many other physiologic processes, and recent studies suggest that the true number of ATM substrates may number several hundred (5Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald III, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E. Zhao Z. Solimini N. Lerenthal Y. Shiloh Y. Gygi S.P. Elledge S.J. Science. 2007; 316: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar).The checkpoint-signaling activities of ATM and ATR are strongly influenced by a group of proteins collectively referred to as checkpoint “mediators,” including MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1) and 53BP1 (p53-binding protein 1), that are recruited to DNA damage sites and may function in a scaffolding capacity (6Stucki M. Jackson S.P. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). More recently, an amplification loop involving ATM, histone H2AX, and MDC1 has been described that sustains ATM activity in response to a transient damage insult. In this model, ATM phosphorylates the carboxyl terminus of the variant histone H2AX, which binds to the BRCT domain of MDC1 (7Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M. Elledge S.J.

H2AX-bound MDC1 recruits additional ATM molecules, which stimulate H2AX phosphorylation, establishing a feed-forward activation cycle in which activated ATM proteins spread from the initial break site.53BP1 is a BRCT domain-containing protein that is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites (10Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The recruitment of 53BP1 requires a Tudor fold that associates with methylated histones H3 and H4 (11Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G.

In addition, 53BP1 associates with phosphorylated Ser-139 of H2AX at DNA damage sites (13Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z.

The picture that has emerged from these findings is that 53BP1 functions in a scaffold capacity to concentrate DNA damage response regulators at DNA damage sites.In this study, we set out to define the early events that contribute to the DNA damage response, with emphasis on the potential contributions of the proteasome. We show that proteasome activity is critically important for phosphorylation and targeting of 53BP1 to damage sites in response to DNA replication stress and that participation of the UBC13-RNF8 ubiquitylation pathway partially accounts for the antagonistic effects of proteasome inhibitors on 53BP1-dependent cellular events.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Drug Treatment—HeLa and U-2 OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. A JL Shepherd Model JL-109 irradiator with a 137Cs source was used for irradiation. For UV irradiation, cells were irradiated without medium using a UVP CL-1000 ultraviolet cross-linker. Hydroxyurea (HU) was dissolved in water at 1 m and used at a final concentration of 2 mm. Camptothecin (CPT) was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mm and used at a final concentration of 2 μm. MG-132 and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO dissolved in DMSO at 10 mm (Calbiochem) were added to the medium at a final concentration of 50 μm 1 h prior to DNA damage. Bortezomib (commercially obtained from Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cambridge, MA) for experimental purposes) was dissolved in water at a concentration of 100 μm and used at a final concentration of 100 nm. KU-55933 (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mm and used at a concentration of 10 μm. For UBC13 knockdown, siRNA against UBC13 (24Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 1692-1697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For RNF8 knockdown, pooled siRNAs against RNF8 (Dharmacon) were used.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from siRNA-transfected cells with RNeasy (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using an iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). PCR was performed using GoTaq polymerase (Promega) with the following primers: UBC13, 5′-ATG GCC GGG CTG CCC-3′ and 5′-GGC ATA TAG CCT AGT CCA TGC-3′; RNF8, 5′-GAA GTG GCC AGT ACA CCC-3′ and 5′-AGG AGC AGA AAC TGT GGG C-3′; and β-actin, 5′-TAC CAC TGG CAT CGT GAT GG-3′ and 5′-TCC TTC TGC ATC CTG TCG G-3′ (26Berlanga O.

Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 supplemented with 0.05% sodium azide. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies against phospho-ATM (S1981, catalog no. AF-1655, R&D Systems), ATM (catalog no. GTX70103, GeneTex), phospho-53BP1 (S25, catalog no. A300-652A, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.), 53BP1 (catalog no. A300-272A, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.), phospho-CHK2 (T68, catalog no.

AF-2054, R&D Systems), CHK1 (G-4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RPA2 (Ab-3, Oncogene), and UBC13 (4E11, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After primary antibody incubation, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence as described (25Dodson G.E. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1692-1697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on 15-mm coverslips were fixed with 3.65% formaldehyde or 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies (diluted in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin) specific for 53BP1 and MDC1 (kindly provided by Dr. Junjie Chen, Yale University) (27Lou Z.

For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining, cells were treated with 20 μm BrdUrd for 30 min before fixation and treated with 2 n HCl for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were stained with anti-BrdUrd (Ab-2, Oncogene) and anti-53BP1 antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3. Anti-c-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for Myc-53BP1Tudor staining as a primary antibody. The cells were stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS (2 μg/ml) and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). A Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope was used to visualize all samples. For focus quantification experiments, cells with ≥10 foci were counted as 53BP1 focus-positive cells, and the percentage was calculated among at least 200 cells by dividing the number of 53BP1 focus-positive cells by the number of 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained cells. The error bars represent S.E. in three independent experiments.Flow Cytometry—For staining phosphorylated histone H3, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol 2 or 4 h following IR or UV irradiation, respectively. The fixed cells were treated with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then incubated with anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (Ser-10; catalog no. 06-570, Upstate) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. After propidium iodide staining, cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEffects of Proteasome Inhibition on DNA Damage Signaling— To examine the effect of proteasome inhibition on the DNA damage response, we first examined the impact of proteasome inhibitors on indices of ATM and ATR signaling. HeLa cells were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 1 h before treatment with DNA-damaging agents, and then the phosphorylation of ATM/ATR downstream factors was analyzed by Western blotting. MG-132 pretreatment caused a slight reduction in the accumulation of Ser-1981-phosphorylated ATM 2 h after exposure to IR, UV light, and HU (Fig. 1A) but did not substantially inhibit CHK2 phosphorylation of Thr-68 or CHK1 phosphorylation of Ser-317 at the 2-h time point. Although MG-132 marginally inhibited UV light-induced signaling at the 2-h time point, it had a more noticeable inhibitory effect at earlier times after UV irradiation. CHK2 phosphorylation and ATM autophosphorylation were reduced by >2-fold in UV light-irradiated, MG-132-treated cells relative to UV light-irradiated controls (Fig. 1B). However, both phospho-CHK2 and phospho-ATM levels recovered to near-normal levels 2 h after UV treatment.FIGURE 1DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of 53BP1 is suppressed by proteasome inhibitors. A, HeLa cells were treated with IR (5 Gy, 1 h), UV light (20 J/m2, 2 h), or HU (2 mm, 2 h) following MG-132 (50 μm, 1 h) or DMSO treatment, and cell extracts were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. B, HeLa cells were irradiated with UV light (20 J/m2) following MG-132 (50 μm, 1 h) or DMSO treatment, collected at the indicated time points, and analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. C, HeLa cells were pretreated with MG-132 (50 μm), N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN; 50 μm), or bortezomib (100 nm) for 1 h, 1 h, or 3 h, respectively, and incubated for 2 h after UV (20 J/m2) irradiation. Protein phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting using appropriate phospho-specific (P) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)53BP1 Regulation by DNA Damage Is Impaired by MG-132— In contrast to the attenuating effects of MG-132 on ATM autophosphorylation and CHK2 on Thr-68 phosphorylation, the UV light- and HU-induced phosphorylation of 53BP1 at Ser-25 was almost completely abolished by MG-132 treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). 53BP1 phosphorylation at Ser-25 caused by UV irradiation was dependent on ATR (supplemental Fig. S1B). However, UV light-induced CHK1 phosphorylation was not affected by MG-132, indicating that the strong inhibitory effect of MG-132 on 53BP1 phosphorylation is not a secondary consequence of impaired S-phase progression or ATR activation. Finally, we also showed that other proteasome inhibitors, including bortezomib and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO, inhibited UV light-induced 53BP1 phosphorylation in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that proteasome inhibitors suppress the activation of ATM/ATR-regulated pathways in UV light-damaged cells and that 53BP1 phosphorylation is particularly sensitive to proteasome inhibition.53BP1 targets to nuclear foci corresponding to DNA damage sites in mammalian cells (22Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To test the effect of MG-132 on 53BP1 focus formation, HeLa cells were pretreated with MG-132 or vehicle for 1 h, exposed to 5 Gy of IR or 20 J/m2 UV light, and then immunostained with anti-53BP1 antibody. MG-132 abolished UV light-induced 53BP1 focus formation and caused a qualitative reduction in the size and intensity of IR-induced 53BP1 foci, although the number of cells displaying foci was reduced by only 30% (Fig. 2, A and B). 53BP1 foci induced by HU, which causes replication fork arrest, were also completely suppressed by MG-132 (data not shown). The ATM inhibitor KU-55933 had no discernible effect on 53BP1 focus formation in response to either stimulus (Fig. 2C). Thus, 53BP1 phosphorylation and targeting to nuclear foci are suppressed by proteasome inhibition, which is most pronounced in response to DNA replication stress.Because UV light-induced checkpoint activation through ATR is enhanced during S-phase (28Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 29Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether MG-132 inhibition of 53BP1 focus formation is restricted to S-phase cells. HeLa cells were labeled with BrdUrd, exposed to UV light, and then fixed and stained with antibodies against 53BP1 and BrdUrd. Approximately equal numbers of BrdUrd-positive and BrdUrd-negative cells scored positive for 53BP1 foci after UV irradiation, indicating that active DNA replication is not required for 53BP1 focus targeting (supplemental Fig. S2). On the other hand, MG-132 pretreatment caused a more pronounced reduction in 53BP1 focus formation in BrdUrd-positive cells following IR treatment. These results suggest that the strong inhibitory effect of MG-132 on 53BP1 focus formation in response to UV exposure is not restricted to S-phase cells.MG-132 Suppresses 53BP1 Focus Formation Downstream of H2AX and MDC1—The focal accumulation of 53BP1 is dependent on phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) and another DNA damage mediator, MDC1 (7Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 14Ward I.M. Minn K. Jorda K.G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19579-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, UV light-induced focal targeting of both γH2AX and MDC1 was qualitatively normal in MG-132-treated cells, suggesting that the defect in 53BP1 focus targeting was not secondary to defects in the focal accumulation of these DNA damage mediators (Fig. 3, A and B). We also examined the potential relationship between MG-132-dependent inhibition of 53BP1 phosphorylation and p53, a labile protein that accumulates in response to proteasome inhibition (31Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to results obtained using HeLa cells, which are functionally null for p53, 53BP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C) and focus targeting (supplemental Fig. S3) were inhibited in wild-type p53 U-2 OS cells in response to IR, UV light, or CPT treatment. We also observed that CPT-induced phosphorylation of the 32-kDa subunit of replication protein A (RPA2) was completely abolished in MG-132-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Aminoterminal phosphorylation of RPA2 in response to CPT is both ATR- and DNA-protein kinase-dependent (32Block W.D. Yu Y. Lees-Miller S.P.

Thus, inhibition of 53BP1 phosphorylation and inhibition of RPA2 phosphorylation represent two downstream consequences of proteasome inhibition in mammalian cells.FIGURE 3MG-132 suppresses 53BP1 focus formation downstream of H2AX and MDC1. A and B, MG-132 does not inhibit γH2AX or MDC1 focus formation. HeLa cells were irradiated with UV light (20 J/m2) with or without MG-132 (50 μm, 1 h) pretreatment and then incubated for 2 h before immunostaining with γH2AX-specific (A) or MDC1-specific (B) antibodies. C, MG-132 inhibits 53BP1 and RPA2 phosphorylation (P) in wild-type p53 U-2 OS cells. U-2 OS cells were treated with IR (5 Gy, 1 h), UV light (20 J/m2, 2 h), HU (2 mm, 2 h), or CPT (2 μm, 2 h) following MG-132 (50 μm, 1 h) or DMSO treatment. Cell extracts were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The arrow indicates the phosphorylated form of RPA2. D, MG-132 inhibits 53BP1 phosphorylation in the presence of overexpressed p53. pCEP4-p53 was transfected into U-2 OS cells. Transfected or untransfected U-2 OS cells were irradiated with UV light after MG-132 (50 μm, 1 h) or DMSO treatment and incubated for 2 h. 53BP1 phosphorylation and p53 expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To gain insight into potential mechanisms of proteasome-dependent 53BP1 focus targeting, we examined the effects of MG-132 on the localization of a minimal focus-targeting fragment of 53BP1 spanning amino acids 1220–1703 (Fig. 4A) (35Pryde F.

This fragment of 53BP1 spans the Tudor domain, which targets 53BP1 to foci through interaction with dimethylated histone H4 (11Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G.

The focus targeting of 53BP1Tudor in UV light- and IR-treated cells was inhibited by MG-132 treatment (Fig. 4B). This finding suggests that MG-132 inhibits 53BP1 focus targeting by blocking an upstream event required for Tudor domain recruitment.

The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 participates in DNA post-replication repair of DNA damage in conjunction with Rad6 and Rad18 (36Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S.

https://openalex.org/W1983789431,"In the standard model of terrestrial planet formation, the first step in the process is for interstellar dust to coagulate within a protoplanetary disk surrounding a young star, forming large grains that settle towards the disk plane. Interstellar grains of typical size approximately 0.1 microm are expected to grow to millimetre- (sand), centimetre- (pebble) or even metre-sized (boulder) objects rather quickly. Unfortunately, such evolved disks are hard to observe because the ratio of surface area to volume of their constituents is small. We readily detect dust around young objects known as 'classical' T Tauri stars, but there is little or no evidence of it in the slightly more evolved 'weak-line' systems. Here we report observations of a 3-Myr-old star, which show that grains have grown to about millimetre size or larger in the terrestrial zone (within approximately 3 au) of this star. The fortuitous geometry of the KH 15D binary star system allows us to infer that, when both stars are occulted by the surrounding disk, it appears as a nearly edge-on ring illuminated by one of the central binary components. This work complements the study of terrestrial zones of younger disks that have been recently resolved by interferometry."
https://openalex.org/W2021177219,"G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through a limited number of G-protein pathways and play crucial roles in many biological processes. Studies of their in vivo functions have been hampered by the molecular and functional diversity of GPCRs and the paucity of ligands with specific signaling effects. To better compare the effects of activating different G-protein signaling pathways through ligand-induced or constitutive signaling, we developed a new series of RASSLs (receptors activated solely by synthetic ligands) that activate different G-protein signaling pathways. These RASSLs are based on the human 5-HT4b receptor, a GPCR with high constitutive Gs signaling and strong ligand-induced G-protein activation of the Gs and Gs/q pathways. The first receptor in this series, 5-HT4-D100A or Rs1 (RASSL serotonin 1), is not activated by its endogenous agonist, serotonin, but is selectively activated by the small synthetic molecules GR113808, GR125487, and RO110-0235. All agonists potently induced Gs signaling, but only a few (e.g., zacopride) also induced signaling via the Gq pathway. Zacopride-induced Gq signaling was enhanced by replacing the C-terminus of Rs1 with the C-terminus of the human 5-HT2C receptor. Additional point mutations (D66A and D66N) blocked constitutive Gs signaling and lowered ligand-induced Gq signaling. Replacing the third intracellular loop of Rs1 with that of human 5-HT1A conferred ligand-mediated Gi signaling. This Gi-coupled RASSL, Rs1.3, exhibited no measurable signaling to the Gs or Gq pathway. These findings show that the signaling repertoire of Rs1 can be expanded and controlled by receptor engineering and drug selection."

The MRSA phenotype reverts to that of β-lactam-sensitive S. aureus when bacteria are grown at pH 5.0 in broth and, more importantly from a medical perspective (protracted, relapsing infections), after phagocytosis by macrophages, where the bacteria thrive in the acidic environment of phagolysosomes. The central factor for the MRSA phenotype is the function of the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a, which maintains transpeptidase activity while being poorly inhibited by β-lactams because of a closed conformation of its active site. We document herein by binding, acylation/deacylation kinetics, and circular dichroism spectroscopy with purified PBP 2a that at acidic pH (i) β-lactams interact with PBP 2a more avidly; (ii) the non-covalent pre-acylation complex exhibits a lower dissociation constant and an increased rate of acyl-enzyme formation (first-order rate constant) without change in hydrolytic deacylation rate; and (iii) PBP 2a undergoes a conformational change in the presence of the antibiotic consistent with the opening of the active site from the closed conformation. These observations argue that PBP 2a most likely evolved for its physiological function at pH 7 or higher by adopting a closed conformation, which is not maintained at acidic pH. Although at the organism level the effect of acidic pH on other biological processes in MRSA could not be discounted, our report should provide the impetus for closer examination of the properties of PBP 2a at low pH and thereby identifying novel points of intervention in combating this problematic organism.

MRSA represents also a therapeutic challenge because effective therapeutic options are becoming limited. MRSA, indeed, has a most remarkable ability in expanding its genome and in enhancing its ability to counter antibacterial agents (12Fuda C.C. Fisher J.F. Mobashery S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2617-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, vancomycin, most commonly recommended for treating infections caused by the hospital-acquired strains of MRSA, becomes increasingly compromised by the spreading of variants with reduced susceptibility (vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus isolates) and, in some instances, the emergence of fully resistant organisms (13Appelbaum P.C. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2006; 12: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Resistance to new antibiotics with approved indications for MRSA infections such as linezolid (an oxazolidinone), daptomycin (a lipopetide), or tigecycline (a modified tetracycline) has already been noted as well (14Pantosti A. Sanchini A. Monaco M. Fut. Microbiol. 2007; 2: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).The major mechanism of resistance of MRSA to β-lactam antibiotics is due to the acquisition of the mecA gene encoding an additional penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2a; also referred to in the literature as PBP 2′) (15Hartman B.J. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 513-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Georgopapadakou N.H. Smith S.A. Bonner D.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 22: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that can function as a transpeptidase. In the face of the challenge by β-lactam antibiotics, the other staphylococcal transpeptidases are inhibited, but PBP 2a retains its activity. In association with the transglycosylase domain of the native PBP 2, the activity of which is not inhibited by β-lactams (17Pinho M.G. Filipe S.R. de Lencastre H. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6525-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), PBP 2a performs the critical cross-linking of the cell wall of the bacterium and as such serves a vital function for the organism.Understanding of the properties of PBP 2a is at the forefront of restoring susceptibility to β-lactams, which is an important aim (12Fuda C.C. Fisher J.F. Mobashery S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2617-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Efforts toward this goal largely encompass work in the direction of discovery of novel β-lactams that inhibit both PBP 2a and other transpeptidases (18Guignard B. Entenza J.M. Moreillon P. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is of note, however, that susceptibility of MRSA to conventional β-lactams can be almost fully restored, if bacteria are grown at pH of 5.5 or lower. This phenomenon was originally described in the early 1970s for hospital-acquired MRSA growing in broth and exposed to β-lactamase-resistant penicillins or first generation cephalosporins (19Sabath L.D. Wallace S.J. Gerstein D.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 2: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This observation has now been confirmed for other β-lactams, including carbapenems, and applies not only to hospital- but also community-acquired MRSA (20Lemaire S. Van Bambeke F. Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Glupczynski Y. Tulkens P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has also been extended to MRSA growing intracellularly in phagolysosomes of macrophages (where pH is in the acidic range) (21Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar), giving it a broader significance than originally appreciated. This influence of acidic pH was first ascribed to a diminished copy numbers of PBP 2a (15Hartman B.J. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 513-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed, however, that growing bacteria at acidic pH (i) alters neither the expression of the PBP 2a-encoding gene (mecA) nor that of its regulatory genes and (ii) does not decrease the amount of the immunodetectable PBP 2a in whole bacteria (20Lemaire S. Van Bambeke F. Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Glupczynski Y. Tulkens P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We also found that MRSA grown and exposed to [3H]penicillin G at acidic pH show a larger retention of radioactivity than if bacteria had been grown at neutral pH (this amount being actually brought to a level similar to what is observed with MSSA grown and exposed to [3H]penicillin G at neutral pH) (20Lemaire S. Van Bambeke F. Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Glupczynski Y. Tulkens P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).An in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying restoration of susceptibility of MRSA to β-lactams by acidic pH is of profound significance. It would, indeed, not only explain the antibiotic susceptibility of the organism within phagolysosomes and other habitats where pH is low, but it might also reveal avenues of intervention in treatment of this problematic bacterium. In this report, we have examined the relationship between pH and the function of PBP 2a. Our data show that acidic pH causes a significant change in conformational behavior of PBP 2a, rendering it more susceptible to β-lactams. In terms of mechanistic consequence, we assert that these observations are quite similar to those recently reported for new cephalosporins that are capable of inhibiting PBP 2a effectively, arguing for an underlying principal that governs both cases (22Fuda C.

MICs were measured by microdilution (log2 progression) in Muller Hinton broth supplemented by 2% NaCl for MRSA (United States Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, Wayne, PA) and adjusted to appropriate pH by the careful addition of 1 n HCl (we checked in previous work (20Lemaire S.

Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We used it here to examine the penicillin binding properties of bacteria growing at acidic versus neutral pH, following a procedure used previously to study the binding of radiolabeled penicillin G (20Lemaire S.

A 10-ml portion of growing bacteria (5-h culture; OD660 nm =∼0.5) were exposed to Bocillin FL (25 μg) for 30 min at pH 7.4 or 5.5. Bacteria were then collected by centrifugation, washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by three successive freeze-thawing cycles (5 min at –80 °C followed by 5 min at 37 °C). The amount of fluorescent material was measured in a Packard Fluorocount Microplate Reader instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Analytical Science, Inc., Waltham, MA) using excitation and emission wavelengths set at 485 and 530 nm, respectively, with linearity obtained between 0.002 and 2.5 mg/liter; R2 > 0.998) and expressed by reference to the sample protein content.Purification and Determination of the Solubility of PBP 2a—The mecA gene was cloned previously, and a general procedure for protein purification was used as described earlier (27Fuda C.

The solubility of the protein was assessed as described (22Fuda C. Hesek D. Lee M. Heilmayer W. Novak R. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol.

The results for each condition of pH indicated that the protein remained fully soluble for up to 3 days.Bocillin FL-PBP 2a Binding Assay—We adapted a previously described method (28Preston D.A. Wu C.Y. Blaszczak L.C. Seitz D.E. Halligan N.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but using Bocillin FL as a reporter antibiotic. The purified protein was first diluted for 10 min in pH-adjusted buffer containing 1 m NaCl (pH 7.0, 25 mm HEPES buffer; pH 5.0–7.0, 25 mm phosphate buffer; we checked that the results obtained at pH 7.0 were not influenced by the buffer used) and then incubated with Bocillin FL for various time intervals. Aliquots were collected, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the acyl-enzyme complex was detected by fluorescence (Storm 840® Fluorimager; Amersham Biosciences). The results are expressed as relative emission intensities. Equiloading of the gels was checked in all experiments by Coomassie Blue staining. For control purposes, (i) the binding of Bocillin FL was also examined by immunodetection using an antibody raised against the fluorescent moiety of the molecule (anti-BODIPY® FL rabbit IgG) and goat horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (both from Invitrogen); (ii) we also looked at the binding of 3H-labeled penicillin G, following the same approach as for Bocillin FL with assay of radioactivity in the PBP 2a band observed after SDS-PAGE.Determination of the Kinetic Parameters for Interactions of Nitrocefin with PBP 2a—Acylation and deacylation studies (using nitrocefin for acylation and Bocillin FL for deacylation as reporter molecules, respectively) were performed as described earlier (27Fuda C.

Unless stated otherwise, all other reagents were obtained from Merck AG or Sigma-Aldrich.Statistical Analyses—Curve fitting analyses were made using GraphPad Prism® version 4.03 for Windows (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego, CA).

The β-lactamase was a first response to the early penicillins, which was successfully coped with by the use of β-lactamase-resistant penicillins and cephalosporins, and β-lactamase inhibitors. However, the consequence of the expression of PBP 2a in MRSA was more profound, because it conferred resistance to all commercially available β-lactam antibiotics (12Fuda C.C. Fisher J.F. Mobashery S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2617-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).In studying the mechanism of β-lactam resistance by MRSA, we already have reported that acidic pH markedly decreases the MIC of cloxacillin (a β-lactamase-resistant penicillin) and meropenem (a carbapenem) for the β-lactamase-positive MRSA strain ATCC 33591 (20Lemaire S. Van Bambeke F. Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Glupczynski Y. Tulkens P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the context of the present study, we repeated these experiments with the β-lactamase-negative MRSA COL strain in comparison with the β-lactamase-negative MSSA strain ATCC 25923, using penicillin G (also known as benzylpenicillin, selected as reference β-lactam), penicillin V (Bocillin FL used for our binding and kinetic studies is a fluorogenic derivative of penicillin V (25Gee K.R. Kang H.C. Meier T.I. Zhao G. Blaszcak L.C. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 960-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Zhao G. Meier T.I. Kahl S.D. Gee K.R. Blaszczak L.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1124-1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and oxacillin (a β-lactamase-resistant penicillin recommended for the treatment of infections caused by MSSA and also used by us in subsequent studies). The results presented in Fig. 1 reveal that, as a general trend, decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 5.0 lowered the MICs for all three antibiotics. The results were quite dramatic for penicillin G, with MICs for the MRSA COL strain experiencing attenuation of 11 log2 dilutions, reaching values identical to those observed for this antibiotic when tested against the MSSA ATCC 25923 strain (for which acidic pH caused only a modest decrease (1 log2 dilution) compared with neutral pH). For oxacillin, the decrease in MICs for the MRSA COL strain reached 9 log2 dilutions for the same change of pH. The decrease in MICs for penicillin V for the MRSA COL strain was less marked but still quite significant (4 log2 dilutions). The MICs of oxacillin and penicillin V at pH 5 were similar (0.25–1 mg/liter) but ∼4–5 log2 dilutions higher than those of penicillin G. Thus, the restoration of absolute susceptibility of the MRSA COL strain to oxacillin and penicillin V was less marked than for penicillin G, a point that will need to be taken into account for correct interpretation of the results of our subsequent studies.We then compared the influence of pH on total penicillin binding properties of growing MRSA (COL strain) and MSSA (ATCC 25923 strain) by exposing them to Bocillin FL in broth and measuring thereafter the amount of Bocillin FL associated with cell extracts. Fig. 2 (upper panel) shows that the binding of Bocillin FL was considerably less for MRSA in comparison with MSSA when bacteria had been grown and binding had been performed at pH 7. Binding to MRSA was increased ∼50-fold when the experiment was performed at pH 5.5. Most interestingly, no significant difference was noted between MSSA and MRSA for bacteria grown and tested at that pH.FIGURE 2Influence of pH on the binding of Bocillin FL to whole cells and to purified PBP 2a. Upper panel, growing bacteria were incubated in broth at 37 °C with Bocillin FL for 30 min at the pH indicated in the abscissa, and the samples were prepared for fluorescence measurement. White bars, MSSA ATCC 25923; gray bars, MRSA COL. The values are the means ± S.D. (n = 3). Bars with different letters are significantly different from all others (p < 0.01). Lower panel, Bocillin FL (0.2 μg) was mixed for 20 min with 3 μm purified PBP 2a in 50 mm phosphate buffers adjusted to different pH values before being applied to gel for electrophoretic separation (the value recorded in HEPES buffer at pH 7.0 was not significantly different from that shown for the corresponding phosphate buffer here).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These experiments prompted us to directly measure the binding of Bocillin FL to purified PBP 2a. Fig. 2 (lower panel) shows that binding was pH-dependent with values ∼5-fold larger at pH 5 compared with pH 7, under the experimental condition used. This indicates that the covalent chemistry that PBP 2a experiences and, by necessity, the access to the active site by the antibiotic are enhanced at lower pH. In subsequent experiments, the influence of pH on binding of Bocillin FL to PBP 2a was further characterized with respect to concentration and time. The results presented in Fig. 3 (left panel) show that more Bocillin FL could bind to PBP 2a at low concentrations at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.0, denoting potentially a higher affinity. The experiment in the right panel of Fig. 3 reveals that acylation of the enzyme is achieved more readily at lower pH within the 20 min of the experimental time frame, which is consistent with and relevant to the doubling time of most staphylococci. This indicates, as hypothesized in this study, that PBP 2a is more susceptible to inhibition by a β-lactam antibiotic within the growth time frame of the organisms. Given unlimited time for the requisite conformational change of PBP 2a to take place, the fluorescence that results from covalent chemistry caused by the ultimate 100% protein modification at the two experimental pH points should converge.FIGURE 3Influence of pH on the binding of Bocillin FL to purified PBP 2a. Incubations were performed at room temperature in 1 m NaCl buffered at 5.5 (25 mm phosphate) or at 7.0 (25 mm HEPES) with PBP 2a (3 μm). Left panel, binding measured after 25 min in the presence of increasing amounts of Bocillin FL (logarithmic scale) Right panel, binding measured over a 20 min time frame in the presence of 0.5 μg of Bocillin FL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two types of controls were made to check against possible artifacts because of the use of the fluorescent tracer. First, we examined whether acidic pH would modify the fluorescence of Bocillin FL (tested at two dilutions) and found no effect. Second, we looked for Bocillin FL binding by immunochemical detection rather than by fluorescence and for 3H-labeled-penicillin G (using another sample of soluble PBP 2a (kindly provided by J. Coyette)) and found also an increased binding.The kinetics of PBP 2a acylation and deacylation by β-lactams at neutral and acidic pH were then undertaken using nitrocefin and Bocillin FL as reporter molecules for acylation and deacylation, respectively. We took advantage of the distinctive change in the absorption spectrum of nitrocefin upon cleavage of the amide bond in the β-lactam ring by enzyme acylation and the capacity of Bocillin FL to bind PBP 2a as the acyl-enzyme species experienced deacylation (see Ref. 27Fuda C. Suvorov M. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40802-40806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar for experimental design). We first investigated nitrocefin for the purpose of this work by measuring its MIC toward the MRSA COL strain at pH 5.5 versus 7.4 and observed values of 0.25 and 2 mg/liter, respectively. Subsequently, we determined certain kinetic parameters for interactions of the antibiotic with PBP 2a (Table 1). The minimal interaction scheme assumes binding of nitrocefin (N) to the enzyme in an initial non-covalent complex (EN), which proceeds to acylate the active site serine of PBP 2a, to give rise to the covalent complex E-N (Table 1). This covalent complex enjoys substantial longevity, but nonetheless ultimately experiences hydrolytic deacylation to liberate PBP 2a from inhibition. Table 1 shows the pertinent dissociation constant (Kd) of the nitrocefin-PBP 2a non-covalent complex (EN), the PBP 2a acylation rate constant (k2) to yield the acyl-enzyme species (E-N), and the deacylation rate constant from E-N (k3). It appears that at the acidic pH the dissociation constant for the pre-acylation complex was lowered by 2-fold, and the rate constant for enzyme acylation was enhanced by somewhat more than the same magnitude. We hasten to add that PBP 2a does not have the catalytic machinery for the deacylation of the acyl-enzyme species, and this is the reason that once the acyl-enzyme species has formed, it enjoys substantial longevity. As such, we note that the values for the deacylation rate constants at the two pH values remain unchanged within the error limits recorded for the determinations. This is exactly as would have been expected. As a result, the apparent second-order rate constant for the process between PBP 2a and nitrocefin (k2/Kd), a measure of the overall efficiency of PBP 2a inhibition by the β-lactam, experienced an increased of 5-fold in acidic pH, in agreement with the change in MIC. We also checked for the maximal amplitude of the reaction at the pH 5.5 and 7.0 and found no significant difference, indicating that PBP 2a was not intrinsically resistant to acylation at pH 7 versus pH 5.5 but rather required larger drug concentration to achieve saturation of the enzyme. This is also indicated by the elevated MIC values at higher pH.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for interactions of nitrocefin and PBP 2a at pH 5.0 and 7.0ParameterpH7.05.5Kd (μm)195 ± 28100 ± 30k2 (s-1 × 103)6.0 ± 0.615.2 ± 1.5k3 (s-1 × 106)2.5 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.2k2/Kd (s-1 m-1)31 ± 3150 ± 14 Open table in a new tab The results reported above argue for a general improved access by the antibiotic to the active site. This is manifested in the lowering of the dissociation constant for the pre-acylation complex, which indicates a more favorable formation of the complex at the lower pH. In addition, we note a more favorable process for the acylation of the enzyme. These observations are telling in view of the available x-ray structure for PBP 2a in the native state and in complex with two antibiotics, including nitrocefin (30Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 870-876PubMed Google Scholar). The existing structural information reveals PBP 2a to exist in a state that is best described as a closed conformation for the active site for both the native and the acyl-enzyme species (27Fuda C.

VDCCs have multiple subunit structures consisting of a major pore-forming subunit (α1) and several auxiliary subunits (α2δ, β, and γ) (1Hofmann F. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

VDCCs are classified into L-type (Cav1.1, Cav1.2, Cav1.3, and Cav1.4: α1S, α1C, α1D, and α1F, respectively), P/Q-type (Cav2.1: α1A), N-type (Cav2.2: α1B), R-type (Cav2.3: α1E), and T-type (Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3: α1G, α1H, and α1I, respectively) based on electrophysiological and pharmacological properties (3Ertel E.A.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 533-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Among the auxiliary subunits, the β subunits are entirely cytosolic, and they have marked effects on the properties of VDCCs α1 subunits, including trafficking of Ca2+ channel complexes to the plasma membrane, voltage dependence and activation/inactivation kinetics of Ca2+ currents (4Berrow N.S. Campbell V. Fitzgerald E.M. Brickley K. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 481-491Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Dolphin A.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Four β subunits (Cavβ1–4) have been cloned, and each Cavβ has distinctive properties (5Dolphin A.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), but their functional roles in the brain in vivo are still poorly understood. Structurally, Cavβ has five different domains, with the two conserved domains sharing significant homology among the β subunits. The conserved domains were revealed as an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a guanylate kinase (GK) domain (6Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J.

Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and thus Cavβ is included in membrane-associated guanylate kinase family that has scaffolding functions. Interestingly, it has been suggested that Cavβ can bind to other molecules (10Hidalgo P. Neely A. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Rousset M. Cens T. Charnet P. Sci. STKE 2005,. 2005; : PE11Google Scholar). For example, Cavβ could directly interact with small G-proteins (Gem and Rem) and dynamin (12Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T.

Chem. 2007; 282: 2156-2162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have suggested that Cavβ can work without marked influence on VDCCs. For example, regulation of gene transcription by a direct interaction between a short splice variant of Cavβ4 and a nuclear protein was shown in the cochlea (15Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Rousset M. Charnet P. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cavβ3 was also shown to regulate insulin secretion by acting on the intracellular Ca2+ store, whereas Ca2+ currents of VDCCs were not affected (16Berggren P.O. Yang S.N. Murakami M. Efanov A.M. Uhles S. Kohler M. Moede T. Fernstrom A. Appelskog I.B. Aspinwall C.A. Zaitsev S.V. Larsson O. de Vargas L.M. Fecher-Trost C. Weissgerber P. Ludwig A. Leibiger B. Juntti-Berggren L. Barker C.J.

This study suggests that Cavβ can function as a multifunctional protein. Of the Cavβ subunits, Cavβ3 is highly expressed in the brain, especially in the hippocampus (17Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that α1 subunits of N- and L-type VDCCs were preferentially associated with Cavβ3 in the hippocampus (18Pichler M. Cassidy T.N. Reimer D. Haase H. Kraus R. Ostler D. Striessnig J. J.

In addition, N- and L-type VDCCs have been strongly implicated in activity-dependent long lasting synaptic changes, such as LTP, as well as in learning and memory (21Jeon D. Kim C. Yang Y.M. Rhim H. Yim E. Oh U. Shin H.S. Genes Brain Behav. 2007; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Moosmang S. Haider N. Klugbauer N. Adelsberger H. Langwieser N. Muller J. Stiess M. Marais E.

Therefore, we examined the Cavβ3-deficient mice (23Namkung Y. Smith S.M. Lee S.B. Skrypnyk N.V. Kim H.L. Chin H. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Shin H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory and synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, long term memory and NMDAR-dependent LTP were increased in the Cavβ3-deficient mice, whereas there was no significant change in Ca2+ currents. Furthermore, the mutant mice showed increased NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses and an increased NR2B level in the hippocampus. These results reveal Ca2+ channel-independent functions of Cavβ3 in the hippocampus. Animals—The generation of mice lacking Cavβ3 was described in our previous study (23Namkung Y. Smith S.M. Lee S.B. Skrypnyk N.V. Kim H.L. Chin H. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Shin H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cavβ3 heterozygous (Cavβ3+/–) mice were backcrossed into two inbred backgrounds, C57BL/6J and 129S4/SvJae, each over 18 generations. Cavβ3 wild-type (Cavβ3+/+) and Cavβ3-deficient (Cavβ3–/–) mice used for analysis were obtained from interbreeding Cavβ3+/– mice of the two backgrounds. Animal care and handling were carried out according to the institutional guidelines. The mice were maintained with free access to food and water under a 12:12-h light/dark cycle. Behavioral experiments were performed on 8–12-week-old mice. All experiments were performed in a blind manner with respect to the genotype. Contextual and Cued Fear Conditioning—The fear conditioning was carried out as described in our previous study (24Jeon D. Yang Y.M. Jeong M.J. Philipson K.D. Rhim H. Shin H.S. Neuron. 2003; 38: 965-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A fear-conditioning shock chamber (19 × 20 × 33 cm) containing a stainless steel rod floor (5 mm diameter, spaced 1 cm apart) and a monitor was used (WinLinc behavioral experimental control software, Coulbourn Instruments). For conditioning, mice were placed in the fear-conditioning apparatus chamber for 2 min, and then a 28-s acoustic conditioned stimulus (CS) was delivered. Following the CS, a 0.5-mA shock of unconditioned stimulus was immediately applied to the floor grid for 2 s. This protocol was performed twice at 60-s interval. To assess contextual learning, the animals were placed back into the training context 24 h after training, and then freezing behavior was observed for 4 min. To assess cued learning, the animals were placed in a different context (a novel chamber, odor, floor, and visual cues) 24 h after training, and their behaviors were monitored for 5 min. During the last 3 min of this test, animals were exposed to the tone. Fear response was quantified by measuring the length of the time when the animal showed freezing behaviors, which was defined as lack of movements with a crouching position, except for respiratory movements (25Lu Y.M. Jia Z. Janus C. Henderson J.T. Gerlai R. Wojtowicz J.M. Roder J.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5196-5205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Foot-shock intensity was evaluated by placing naive animals in the conditioning chamber used for fear conditioning. Animals were subjected to a 1-s series of gradually increasing mild foot-shock amperage at 20-s intervals as follows: 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mA. The shock intensity that evoked initial sensation responses (flinching and running), vocalization, and jumping was recorded for each mouse. Novel Object Recognition Memory Task—The task was performed as described (24Jeon D. Yang Y.M. Jeong M.J. Philipson K.D. Rhim H. Shin H.S.

The mice were individually habituated to an open-field box (40 × 40 × 40 cm) for 3 days. During the training trial, two objects were placed in the box, and animals were allowed to explore them for 5 min. A mouse was considered to be exploring the object when its head was facing the object within 1-inch distance. Following retention intervals (1 or 24 h), animals were placed back into the box with two objects in the same locations, but one of the familiar objects was replaced by a novel object, and mice were then allowed to explore the two objects for 5 min. The preference percentage, percentage of the time spent exploring the novel object over the total time spent exploring both objects, was used to quantitate the recognition memory. Social Transmission of Food Preference Task—This task was performed as described previously (21Jeon D. Kim C. Yang Y.M. Rhim H. Yim E. Oh U. Shin H.S.

Either 1 or 24 h later, observers were given a choice between two scented foods: either the same scented food that the demonstrators had eaten (cued) or another distinctively scented food (non-cued). Half of the observers in each genotype was subjected to interaction with the demonstrators that had eaten cinnamon as cued food and the other half with those that had eaten cocoa as cued food to control for the possibility of food preference bias. Whole-cell Patch Clamp Recording on Acutely Isolated CA1 Pyramidal Neurons and on Hippocampal Slices—All experiments were performed on 2–3-week-old mice. Preparation of and recording from hippocampal slices (400 μm thick) were as described in our previous study (21Jeon D. Kim C. Yang Y.M. Rhim H. Yim E. Oh U. Shin H.S. Genes Brain Behav. 2007; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Song I. Kim D. Choi S. Sun M. Kim Y. Shin H.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hippocampal slices were prepared in oxygenated, cold ACSF (124 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). For the measurement of Ca2+ currents, acutely isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons were prepared from hippocampal slices, as described in our previous study (30Song I. Kim D. Choi S. Sun M. Kim Y. Shin H.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The recorded CA1 neurons were voltage-clamped at –60 mV using glass pipette electrodes (3–5 MΩ series resistance <20 MΩ) and the I-V curve was generated in a stepwise fashion: +10-mV increments from –60 to +40 mV. Internal pipette solution contained the following, 130 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm MgATP, 0.3 mm Tris-GTP, 5 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, and was brought to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Extracellular solution contained the following, 25 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm 4-aminopyridine, 20 mm HEPES, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.001 mm tetrodotoxin, and was brought to pH 7.4 with NaOH. For the measurement of after hyperpolarization (AHP) currents, visually guided CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slice were held at –55 mV, and currents were evoked by depolarizing voltage commands to 20 mV for 200 ms followed by a return to –55 mV for 10 s. During recording, the slices were superfused with ACSF at room temperature. Glass pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were filled with solution containing 140 mm KMeSO4, 8 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 0.4 mm Na2-GTP, and 0.02 mm EGTA (pH 7.3, 290 mosm). In addition, action potentials (APs) were triggered under current clamp mode by depolarizing current injection (from +30 to +90 pA), and the number of AP (from threshold to the peak) and AP durations (width at half-height) were measured. The internal solution for mEPSC (miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents) recording was filled with the following buffer, 135 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Mg-ATP and 0.3 mm Na-GTP, and was brought to pH 7.4 with KOH. The experiment was performed in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 μm) and bicuculline (10 μm, a GABA type a receptor antagonist). The recorded CA1 pyramidal neurons were voltage-clamped at –70 mV. The frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs were analyzed with MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft) (21Jeon D. Kim C. Yang Y.M. Rhim H. Yim E. Oh U. Shin H.S. Genes Brain Behav. 2007; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For the measurement of AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents in visually guided CA1 pyramidal neurons, pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were filled with the internal solution (130 mm cesium gluconate, 5 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm QX-314, 4 mm Na-ATP, and 0.4 mm Na-GTP, brought to pH 7.3 with CsOH). The currents were measured in the presence of bicuculline (10 μm) and CGP 55845 (5 μm, a GABA type B receptor antagonist). The synaptic currents were evoked by a bipolar tungsten electrode that was placed in the stratum radiatum. NMDAR- and AMPAR-mediated responses were discriminated based on their distinct kinetics and voltage dependence; the NMDAR-mediated currents were measured at +40 mV, 100 ms after the response onset, whereas the AMPAR-mediated currents were taken as the peak amplitude response recorded at –70 mV (31Saura C.A. Choi S.Y. Beglopoulos V. Malkani S. Zhang D. Shankaranarayana Rao B.S. Chattarji S. Kelleher III, R.J. Kandel E.R. Duff K. Kirkwood A. Shen J. Neuron. 2004; 42: 23-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). D-AP5 (50 μm) blocked the late component of the currents recorded at +40 mV, whereas CNQX (10 μm), an AMPA receptor blocker, eliminated the currents recorded at –70 mV. Whole-cell patch clamp currents were recorded and digitized with a MultiClamp 700A amplifier and a Digidata 1320 or 1322A (Axon Instruments, CA), and acquired data were analyzed with the pCLAMP version 9.2 (Axon Instruments) and the Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft). Extracellular Recording on Hippocampal Slices—Preparation of hippocampal slices and the method of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) recording have been described previously (21Jeon D. Kim C. Yang Y.M. Rhim H. Yim E. Oh U. Shin H.S. Genes Brain Behav. 2007; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Jeon D. Yang Y.M. Jeong M.J. Philipson K.D. Rhim H. Shin H.S. Neuron. 2003; 38: 965-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from 7–8-week-old mice, as described above. Slices were then placed in a warm, humidified (32 °C, 95% O2, 5% CO2) recording chamber containing oxygenated ACSF and maintained for 1.5 h prior to experiments. A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in the stratum radiatum in the CA1 region, and extracellular field potentials were also recorded in the stratum radiatum using a glass microelectrode (borosilicate glass, 3–5 MΩ, filled with 3 m NaCl). Test responses were elicited at 0.033 Hz. Base-line stimulation was delivered at an intensity that evoked a response that was ∼40% of the maximum evoked response. LTP was induced electrically by one of the following protocols: 1) 100-Hz LTP was induced for 100 ms, 300 ms, or 1 s; 2) 200-Hz LTP was induced by 10 trains of 200-ms stimulation at 200 Hz delivered every 5 s. LTD was elicited by paired-pulses low frequency stimulation (PP-LFS) (50-ms pulse interval at 1 Hz for 15 min). Drugs were added to the perfusion medium at least 30 min before recording. Immunohistology and Western Blot—Immunostaining was performed as described previously (32Jeon D. Chu K. Jung K.H. Kim M. Yoon B.W. Lee C.J. Oh U. Shin H.S. Cell Calcium. in press, 2007Google Scholar, 33Kang Y.S. Kong J.H. Park W.M. Kwon O.J. Lee J.E. Kim S.Y. Jeon C.J. Mol. Cells. 2002; 14: 361-366PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were anesthetized and perfused through the heart with 50 ml of cold saline and 50 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Brains were then removed and were post-fixed overnight. Coronal sections containing hippocampus were stained with the following primary antibodies: anti-β3 subunit (anti-Cavβ3, Alomone Labs), anti-SMI-32, and anti-GAD. A biotinylated secondary antibody and the avidin/biotin system were used for each antibody followed by a 3,3′-diaminobenzidene reaction. Some of the DAB reactions incorporated a nickel intensification procedure. For gross morphology of the hippocampus, Nissl staining was used. For Western blot analysis, total hippocampal proteins were prepared as described previously (34Elias G.M. Funke L. Stein V. Grant S.G. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 2006; 52: 307-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). 25 μg of protein were loaded per lane and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The following antibodies have been described previously: NMDAR 2A/2B (35Sheng M. Cummings J. Roldan L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) and GluR1/2 (34Elias G.M. Funke L. Stein V. Grant S.G. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 2006; 52: 307-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The following fusion protein was used for the generation of the following polyclonal antibody: H6-rat NMDAR1 (amino acids 340–561; 1740 guinea pig). Antibody for α-tubulin was purchased from Sigma. Statistical Analysis—All data are given as mean ± S.E. Two-way repeated ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and Student's t test were used for statistical analyses. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Normal Gross Morphology of the Hippocampus in the Cavβ3–/– Mice—We first examined the cytoarchitectonic divisions in the brain of the Cavβ3–/– mice, especially in the hippocampus. The Cavβ3–/– mice exhibited normal hippocampal divisions, including CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus. No expression of Cavβ3 was observed in the Cavβ3–/– hippocampus (Fig. 1A), whereas Cavβ3 was abundant in the wild-type hippocampus as was shown previously (17Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoreactivities and the expression patterns of SMI-32 (a neurofilament protein) (Fig. 1B) and GAD (GABA-synthesizing enzyme) (Fig. 1C) were normally observed in the hippocampus of the Cavβ3–/– mice as in the Cavβ3+/+ mice. In addition, Nissl staining of the coronal brain sections revealed no gross abnormalities in the hippocampus of the Cavβ3–/– mice (Fig. 1D). Enhanced Contextual Fear Conditioning in the Cavβ3–/– Mice—Because Cavβ3 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and is known to be associated with N- or L-type VDCCs, which play important roles in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in animals (17Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pichler M. Cassidy T.N. Reimer D. Haase H. Kraus R. Ostler D. Striessnig J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3207-3212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we examined whether the deletion of Cavβ3 affected the animal's capacity for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. First, we subjected the mice to the fear conditioning assay that is known to require the function of the hippocampus (36Phillips R.G. LeDoux J.E. Behav. Neurosci. 1992; 106: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). The Cavβ3+/+ (n = 14) and Cavβ3–/– (n = 14) mice showed similar levels of freezing response during the training (Fig. 2A). In the contextual fear memory assay performed 24 h after the training, the Cavβ3–/– mice displayed more freezing behavior than the Cavβ3+/+ (F(1, 26) = 8.36, p < 0.01, two-way repeated ANOVA), indicating an enhanced long term memory of the Cavβ3–/– mice for contextual fear conditioning. A post hoc test (Scheffe's test) also revealed significant differences between the two genotypes during the 2nd (p < 0.05), the 3rd (p < 0.05), and the 4th min (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, no difference was observed between the two genotypes in the cued fear conditioning assay (Fig. 2C), indicating that the enhanced memory in the Cavβ3–/– mice is limited to the hippocampus-dependent fear conditioning. There was no significant difference in response to variable electric intensities between Cavβ3–/– (n = 7) and Cavβ3+/+ (n = 9) mice, indicating comparable reactivity or sensitivity to electric foot-shock of the two genotypes (Fig. 2D). Enhanced Novel Object Recognition Memory in the Cavβ3–/– Mice—We next subjected the mice to the novel object recognition task that is based on the animal's ability to discriminate a novel object from a familiar one, which requires the hippocampus (37Vnek N. Rothblat L.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2780-2787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first assessed the amount of time spent by the animals exploring the two objects during the training trial, and we found that both of the genotypes, Cavβ3+/+ (n = 17) and Cavβ3–/– mice (n = 14), explored the two objects for equal time (Fig. 2E), which indicated no preference of the animals for either object. At a 1-h retention interval, when one of the familiar objects was replaced by a novel one, both Cavβ3+/+ (n = 8) and Cavβ3–/– mice (n = 7) exhibited increased preference for the novel object to the familiar one (F(1, 13) = 22.86, p < 0.001, two-way repeated ANOVA). No difference, however, was found between the two genotypes (F(1, 13) = 0.01, p = 0.96, one-way ANOVA) (+/+, 72.90 ± 4.27%; –/–, 73.34 ± 8.83%) (Fig. 2F). At the 24-h retention test, however, Cavβ3–/– mice (n = 7) showed increased preference for the novel object compared with Cavβ3+/+ (n = 9) (F(1, 14) = 36.14, p < 0.001, two-way repeated ANOVA, Scheffe's post hoc test, p < 0.01) (+/+, 62.68 ± 6.26%; –/–, 88.90 ± 3.23%) (Fig. 2F), indicating that the Cavβ3–/– mice have an enhanced performance in the object recognition memory task. Enhanced Long Term Memory in the Social Transmission of Food Preference Task in the Cavβ3–/– Mice—Finally, we carried out the social transmission of food preference assay, another hippocampus-dependent memory task. This task exploits the tendency of mice to prefer food that they have recently smelled on the breath of other mice (demonstrator mice), and subsequently, this tests their ability to learn and remember the information transmitted by olfactory cues during social interactions. 1 h after social interactions with demonstrator mice, both Cavβ3+/+ (n = 7) and Cavβ3–/– (n = 6) mice preferred the “cued” food to the “non-cued” food, and there was no significant difference between the two genotypes (+/+, 83.70 ± 3.63%; –/–, 75.87 ± 7.34%, F(1, 11) = 0.72, p = 0.41, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 2G). The amount of total food eaten was not different between genotypes during this task (Fig. 2H). These results indicate that the mice were not deficient in olfaction or social interactions. On the oth"

H+ binding and release occur at Asp-61 in the middle of the second transmembrane helix (TMH) of F0 subunit c. H+ are thought to reach Asp-61 via aqueous pathways mapping to the surfaces of TMHs 2–5 of subunit a based upon the chemical reactivity of Cys substituted into these helices. Here we substituted Cys into loops connecting TMHs 1 and 2 (loop 1–2) and TMHs 3 and 4 (loop 3–4). A large segment of loop 3–4 extending from loop residue 192 loop to residue 203 in TMH4 at the lipid bilayer surface proved to be very sensitive to inhibition by Ag+. Cys-161 and -165 at the other end of the loop bordering TMH3 were also sensitive to inhibition by Ag+. Further Cys substitutions in residues 86 and 93 in the middle of the 1–2 loop proved to be Ag+-sensitive. We next asked whether the regions of Ag+-sensitive residues clustered together near the surface of the membrane by combining Cys substitutions from two domains and testing for cross-linking. Cys-161 and -165 in loop 3–4 were found to cross-link with Cys-202, -203, or -205, which extend into TMH4 from the cytoplasm. Further Cys at residues 86 and 93 in loop 1–2 were found to cross-link with Cys-195 in loop 3–4. We conclude that the Ag+-sensitive regions of loops 1–2 and 3–4 may pack in a single domain that packs at the ends of TMHs 3 and 4. We suggest that the Ag+-sensitive domain may be involved in gating H+ release at the cytoplasmic side of the aqueous access channel extending through F0.

The H+-transporting F1F0-ATP synthases of oxidative phosphorylation utilize the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient of H+ or Na+ to mechanically drive the synthesis of ATP via two coupled rotary motors in the F1 and F0 sectors of the enzyme (1Yoshida M.

In the intact enzyme, ATP synthesis or hydrolysis takes place in the F1 sector at the surface of the membrane with synthesis coupled to H+ transport through the transmembrane F0 sector. Homologous enzymes are found in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and many bacteria (4Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli and other eubacteria, F1 consists of five subunits in an α3β3γ1δ1ϵ1 stoichiometry (4Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).

A high resolution x-ray structure of the I. tartaricus c11 ring has revealed the sodium binding site at the periphery of the ring with chelating groups to the Na+ extending from two interacting subunits (7Meier T.

The essential I. tartaricus Glu-65 in the Na+-chelating site corresponds to E. coli Asp-61. In the H+-transporting E. coli enzyme, Asp-61 at the center of the second TMH is thought to undergo protonation and deprotonation as each subunit of the c ring moves past a stationary subunit a. In the complete membranous enzyme, the rotation of the c ring is proposed to be driven by H+ transport at the subunit a/c interface with ring movement then driving rotation of subunit γ within the α3β3 hexamer of F1 to cause conformational changes in the catalytic sites leading to synthesis and release of ATP (1Yoshida M.

Previously we probed Cys residues introduced into the five TMHs of subunit a for aqueous accessibility based upon their reactivity with NEM and Ag+ (26Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Angevine C.M. Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One region extending from Asn-214 and Arg-210 near the center of the membrane to the cytoplasmic surface of TMH4 contains Cys residues that are sensitive to inhibition by both NEM and Ag+. A second set of Ag+-sensitive but NEM-inaccessible residues mapped to the opposite face and periplasmic side of TMH4. Ag+-sensitive but NEM-insensitive residues extending from the center of the membrane to the periplasmic surface were also found in TMHs 2, 3, and 5. The Ag+-sensitive residues in TMHs 2, 3, 4, and 5 cluster at the interior of the fourhelix bundle predicted by cross-linking (19Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-378670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and could interact to form a continuous aqueous pathway extending from the periplasmic surface to the center of the membrane. In the experiments reported here, we probed the properties of Cys residues introduced at the cytoplasmic boundary of TMH4 and were surprised to discover an extended cytoplasmic region that was sensitive to Ag+ inhibition. We ultimately introduced Cys substitutions throughout the entire 3–4 loop and then extended mapping to the 1–2 loop. Ag+-sensitive Cys residues were found at both ends of the 3–4 loop and in the middle of the 1–2 loop. We next asked whether the domains of Ag+-sensitive residues clustered together and packed near the surface of the membrane by combining Cys substitutions from two domains and testing for cross-linking. The Ag+-sensitive regions of loops 1–2 and 3–4 proved to be cross-linkable via Cys introduced near the cytoplasmic lipid bilayer interface at the ends of TMHs 3 and 4. We suggest that this Ag+-sensitive domain(s) may be involved in gating H+ release to the cytoplasm from the aqueous access channel extending through F0. Construction of Cys-substituted Mutants—The cysteine substitutions generated here were transferred into plasmid pCMA113 (26Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which contains a hexahistidine tag on the C terminus of subunit a and structural genes encoding F1F0 subunits from which all endogenous Cys had been substituted by Ala or Ser (29Kuo P.H. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cys substitutions were introduced by a two-step PCR method using a synthetic oligonucleotide, which contained the codon change, and two wild type primers (30Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 203-215PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were transferred into pCMA113 directly using unique HindIII (870) or PflMI (1136) and BsrGI (1913) sites (see Ref. 31Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar for nucleotide numbering). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the cloned fragment through the ligation junctions. All experiments were performed with the Cys-substituted derivatives of plasmid pCMA113 transformed into the unc (atp) operon deletion host strain JWP292 (5Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). All plasmid transformant strains were tested for growth on succinate and glucose as described previously (26Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation—Plasmid transformants of strain JWP292 were grown in M63 minimal medium containing 0.6% glucose, 2 mg/liter thiamine, 0.2 mm uracil, 1 mm l-arginine, 0.02 mm dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin supplemented with 10% LB medium and harvested in the late exponential phase of growth (5Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in TMG-acetate buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I and disrupted by passage through a French press at 1.38 × 108 newtons/m2, and membranes were prepared as described previously (32Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final membrane preparation was suspended in TMG-acetate buffer and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Lowry assay (33Fillingame R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 870-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-driven Quenching of ACMA Fluorescence—Membranes were suspended in 3.2 ml of HMK-nitrate buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, 1 mm Mg(NO3)2, 10 mm KNO3, pH 7.5). ACMA was added to 0.3 μg/ml final concentration, and 30 μl of 0.1 m ATP, pH 7.0, was added to initiate quenching of fluorescence. The reaction was terminated by addition of 8 μl of 288 μm nigericin (0.5 μg/ml final concentration). The level of fluorescence obtained after addition of nigericin was normalized to 100% in calculating the percent quenching due to ATP-driven proton pumping. For AgNO3 treatment, 160 μl of membranes at 10 mg/ml were suspended in HMK-nitrate buffer containing 40 μm AgNO3 and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before carrying out the quenching assay. For NEM treatment, membranes at 10 mg/ml in TMG-acetate buffer were treated with 5 mm NEM for 15 min at room temperature and then diluted into HMK-nitrate buffer before carrying out the same quenching assay. Cross-linking with Bis-MTS Reagents—Cys-substituted membranes were diluted to 10 mg/ml in TMG-acetate buffer at pH 8.5. The bis-MTS reagents M2M and M4M (Toronto Research Chemicals) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the membranes to a final concentration of 250 μm. The reaction was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then treated with 5 μl of 0.5 m Na2EDTA, pH 8.0, and incubated an additional 15 min at room temperature. To reduce and reverse cross-link formation, β-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 4% by volume, or alternatively dithiothreitol was added to a concentration of 20 mm, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 15 min prior to dilution into an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol) and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Modification by 1 mm DABMI (Molecular Probes Inc.) was also carried out in SDS sample buffer for 1 h prior to SDS-PAGE. SDS Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Samples were run using the SDS-PAGE system described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar). The separating gel contained 15% acrylamide and 0.71% bisacrylamide in 0.375 m Tris at pH 8.8 with 0.125% SDS. The stacking gel was 3% acrylamide and 0.9% bisacrylamide in 0.125 m Tris at pH 6.8 with 0.1% SDS. The running buffer was 0.025 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, 0.2% SDS adjusted to pH 8.3. The gel was run for 2 h at 75 V through the stacking gel and then for 25 h at a constant 15 mA. Proteins in the separatory gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane by applying 75 V for 1.5 h using 0.192 m glycine, 0.025 m Tris, 20% MeOH buffer adjusted to pH 8.3 (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44935) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed after incubation of the PVDF membrane with 5 mg/ml of GE Healthcare Blocking Agent in 1× PBS-Tween (137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm NaH2PO4, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature or alternatively overnight at 4 °C. Rabbit antiserum directed against the first 10 amino acids of subunit a was preabsorbed to E. coli membranes lacking F0 to reduce immunoartifacts (36Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2815-2817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The primary antiserum against subunit a was diluted 1:5000 in 1× PBS-Tween with 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the PVDF membrane for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody was diluted 1:40,000 in 1× PBS-Tween and incubated with the PVDF membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The PVDF membrane was incubated for 4.5 min with equal volumes of Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrates (Pierce). The PVDF membrane was then exposed to film to visualize the protein. Properties of Cys Substitutions in Loops 1–2 and 3–4 of Subunit a—In this study, Cys substitutions in the 1–2 and 3–4 loops of subunit a were generated in a plasmid encoding subunits of F1 and F0 in which the endogenous Cys residues were substituted by Ala or Ser (26Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These plasmids were transformed into strain JWP292, which carries a chromosomal deletion of the entire unc (atp) operon. The growth of these strains on minimal medium was compared using glucose or succinate as a carbon sources (Table 1). The Cys substitutions reported here had minimal effects on growth with either carbon source. Additionally ATP-driven quenching of ACMA fluorescence was performed on inside-out membrane vesicles of the substituted strains to evaluate ATPase-coupled H+ pumping function (Table 1). The quenching response for most mutants was close to that observed with the control membranes, i.e. maximal quenching in the range of 70–80%. Six substitutions at positions 171, 174, 177, 182, 192, and 195 did lead to significant reductions in quenching into a range of 40–60%, but each of these grew nearly as well as wild type via oxidative phosphorylation on succinate minimal medium.TABLE 1Functional properties of subunit a substitutions in the 1-2 and 3-4 loopsLocation and mutationGrowth on glucoseaYield in liquid minimal medium containing 0.04% glucose expressed as a percentage of growth relative to the cysteine-less control.Growth on succinatebColony size after incubation for 72 h on minimal medium plates containing 22 mm succinate.

Open table in a new tab Ag+ Inhibition of ATPase-coupled H+ Transport in Cys-substituted 1–2 and 3–4 Loops—Inside-out membrane vesicles with Cys substitutions in the 1–2 or 3–4 loops were treated with 40 μm AgNO3 or 5 mm NEM in chloride-free assay buffer, and the effects on ATPase-coupled H+ transport were measured by the quenching of ACMA fluorescence. Examples for five Ag+-sensitive but NEM-insensitive mutants are shown in Fig. 1. In four of the five mutants shown, Ag+ caused an approximate 90% reduction in the quenching response. In the case of the I161C substitution in loop 3–4, Ag+ reduced the quenching response by ∼50%. In contrast to the observed Ag+ inhibition, NEM had negligible inhibitory effects on all substitutions examined in this study. The complete surveys of the Ag+-sensitivity and NEM-sensitivity of cysteine substituted into loops 1–2 and 3–4 are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The positions of the Ag+-sensitive residues in a two-dimensional topological map of subunit a are shown in Fig. 4. The most striking distribution of multiple Ag+-sensitive residues maps to the C-terminal end of loop 3–4 and extends into the cytoplasmic end of TMH4 (Figs. 3 and 4). A single Ag+-sensitive Cys was found in the middle of loop 3–4. In addition, three cysteines showing moderate sensitivity to Ag+ (45–50% inhibition) were found at the N-terminal end of loop 3–4. In loop 1–2, Ag+ sensitivity was confined to three positions in the middle of the loop, i.e. residues 86, 90, and 93. The restriction of Ag+-sensitive Cys to a few localized areas of the loops led us to ask whether the regions interacted physically in the folded structure of the protein and to the crosslinking experiments described below.FIGURE 2NEM and Ag+ sensitivity of Cys substitutions in the 1–2 loop.

Residues that are most sensitive to inhibition by Ag+ are shown in red (>85% inhibition), orange (66–85% inhibition), and brown (46–65% inhibition). The relative depth of placement of the five TMHs of subunit a in the lipid bilayer is based upon cross-linking experiments as described elsewhere (19Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

These reagents cross-link between two cysteine sulfhydryls with formation of bis-disulfide bonds and insertion of a -S-(CH2)n-S-flexible spacer group where n = 2 for M2M and n = 4 for M4M (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cross-link formation was detected by a shift in the mobility of subunit a during SDS-PAGE where the cross-linked product shows greater mobility apparently because of a more compact structure (19Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-378670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results of several double Cys combinations with the I161C substitution, which demonstrated the 50% inhibition of ACMA quenching by Ag+ in Fig. 1, are shown in Fig. 5. The general protocol of the experiment is shown in Fig. 5A for the I161C/K203C double Cys substitution. The migration of untreated and β-mercaptoethanol-reduced subunit a is shown in lanes 2 and 3. When the unmodified double Cys substitution is treated with DABMI (lane 1), subunit a migrates to a higher apparent molecular weight due to the addition of DABMI molecules to the two Cys residues (DABMI Mr = 320). Treatment with M2M or M4M causes a shift in the subunit a band to greater mobility (lanes 5 and 8), and the cross-linking prevents subsequent reaction with DABMI in SDS sample buffer (lanes 4 and 7). The M2M and M4M cross-linked products are reduced, and the original band migration is restored following treatment with β-mercaptoethanol (lanes 6 and 9). The specificity of the reaction is demonstrated in the experiment shown in Fig. 5B where neither M2M nor M4M cause cross-linking with the I161C/P204C double Cys substitution. M2M treatment of the I161C/S202C double Cys was concl"
https://openalex.org/W2018437226,"Background The frequency of synonymous codon usage varies widely between organisms. Suboptimal codon content limits expression of viral, experimental or therapeutic heterologous proteins due to limiting cognate tRNAs. Codon content is therefore often adjusted to match codon bias of the host organism. Codon content also varies between genes within individual mammalian species. However, little attention has been paid to the consequences of codon content upon translation of host proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings In comparing the splicing repressor activities of transfected human PTB and its two tissue-restricted paralogs–nPTB and ROD1–we found that the three proteins were expressed at widely varying levels. nPTB was expressed at 1–3% the level of PTB despite similar levels of mRNA expression and 74% amino acid identity. The low nPTB expression was due to the high proportion of codons with A or U at the third codon position, which are suboptimal in human mRNAs. Optimization of the nPTB codon content, akin to the “humanization” of foreign ORFs, allowed efficient translation in vivo and in vitro to levels comparable with PTB. We were then able to demonstrate that all three proteins act as splicing repressors. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide a striking illustration of the importance of mRNA codon content in determining levels of protein expression, even within cells of the natural host species."
https://openalex.org/W2081945299,"The bioactive surface of scorpion beta-toxins that interact with receptor site-4 at voltage-gated sodium channels is constituted of residues of the conserved betaalphabetabeta core and the C-tail. In an attempt to evaluate the extent by which residues of the toxin core contribute to bioactivity, the anti-insect and anti-mammalian beta-toxins Bj-xtrIT and Css4 were truncated at their N and C termini, resulting in miniature peptides composed essentially of the core secondary structure motives. The truncated beta-toxins (DeltaDeltaBj-xtrIT and DeltaDeltaCss4) were non-toxic and did not compete with the parental toxins on binding at receptor site-4. Surprisingly, DeltaDeltaBj-xtrIT and DeltaDeltaCss4 were capable of modulating in an allosteric manner the binding and effects of site-3 scorpion alpha-toxins in a way reminiscent of that of brevetoxins, which bind at receptor site-5. While reducing the binding and effect of the scorpion alpha-toxin Lqh2 at mammalian sodium channels, they enhanced the binding and effect of LqhalphaIT at insect sodium channels. Co-application of DeltaDeltaBj-xtrIT or DeltaDeltaCss4 with brevetoxin abolished the brevetoxin effect, although they did not compete in binding. These results denote a novel surface at DeltaDeltaBj-xtrIT and DeltaDeltaCss4 capable of interaction with sodium channels at a site other than sites 3, 4, or 5, which prior to the truncation was masked by the bioactive surface that interacts with receptor site-4. The disclosure of this hidden surface at both beta-toxins may be viewed as an exercise in ""reverse evolution,"" providing a clue as to their evolution from a smaller ancestor of similar scaffold."

We examined the irreversible and specific inactivation of antibodies (Abs) to Factor VIII (FVIII) responsible for failure of FVIII replacement therapy in hemophilia A (HA) patients. Electrophilic analogs of FVIII (E-FVIII) and its C2 domain (E-C2) were prepared by placing the strongly electrophilic phosphonate groups at surface-exposed Lys side chains of diverse antigenic epitopes. IgG Abs to FVIII from HA patients formed stable immune complexes with E-FVIII and E-C2 that were refractory to dissociation by SDS treatment and boiling, procedures that dissociate noncovalent Ab-antigen complexes. The rate-limiting step in the reaction was formation of the initial noncovalent complexes. Conversion of the initial complexes to the irreversible state occurred rapidly. The antigenic epitopes of E-FVIII were largely intact, and most of the Abs were consumed covalently. E-FVIII expressed poor FVIII cofactor activity in clotting factor assays. Nonspecific interference by E-FVIII in clotting factor function was not evident. Treatment with E-FVIII, and to a lesser extent E-C2, irreversibly relieved the FVIII inhibitory effect of HA IgG in clotting factor assays.

Inhibitory Abs to Factor VIII (FVIII) in hemophilia A (HA) are a well characterized example. HA is a chromosome X-linked genetic disorder characterized by the synthesis of functionally inactive FVIII. This impairs the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. The primary therapy for control of bleeding in HA patients is infusion of recombinant or plasma-derived FVIII (1Ettingshausen C.E. Kreuz W. Haemophilia. 2006; 12: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). About 20–30% of patients receiving FVIII replacement therapy produce antibodies (Abs) to FVIII that inhibit FVIII cofactor activity. These are referred to clinically as “inhibitors.” The inhibitory effect is thought to derive from reversible steric hindrance of FVIII interactions with phospholipids and other coagulation factors, including thrombin, Factor IXa (FIXa), and von Willebrand factor (2Scandella D. Vox Sang. 1999; 77: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, some Abs inactivate FVIII permanently by catalyzing its proteolytic breakdown (3Lacroix-Desmazes S. Moreau A. Sooryanarayana Bonnemain C. Stieltjes N. Pashov A. Sultan Y. Hoebeke J. Kazatchkine M.D. Kaveri S.V. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1044-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Epitope mapping studies using FVIII fragments (heavy chain, light chains, and A2, A3, C1, and C2 domains) and FVIII hybrid molecules have suggested that many Abs are directed to conformational epitopes (4Spiegel Jr., P.C. Jacquemin M. Saint-Remy J.M. Stoddard B.L. Pratt K.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5Villard S. Piquer D. Raut S. Leonetti J.P. Saint-Remy J.M. Granier C. J.

Most inhibitor positive patients mount a highly diverse immune response consisting of Abs to multiple FVIII epitopes located in the A2, C1, C2, and A3 domains (2Scandella D. Vox Sang. 1999; 77: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Lavigne-Lissalde G. Schved J.F. Granier C. Villard S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 94: 760-769PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kopecky E.M. Greinstetter S. Pabinger I. Buchacher A. Romisch J. Jungbauer A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 308: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The Abs pose major problems in managing acute bleeding episodes and surgical procedures in the patients. Short term bleeding in inhibitor-positive patients can be controlled by infusing activated prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa, agents that bypass the requirement for FVIII in the coagulation pathway (8Lloyd Jones M. Wight J. Paisley S. Knight C. Haemophilia. 2003; 9: 464-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Berntorp E. Gringeri A. Leissinger C. Negrier C. Key N. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2006; 32: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Refractory bleeds occur in about 20% of inhibitor-positive HA patients receiving bypass therapy, and an overdose carries the risk of inducing thrombotic events (9Berntorp E. Gringeri A. Leissinger C. Negrier C. Key N. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2006; 32: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In principle, FVIII itself could be infused to saturate the Abs and restore the coagulation pathway. However, massive quantities of FVIII are required to overcome the inhibitory effect of the circulating Abs even for a short duration. An important clinical advance has been the development of immune tolerance protocols in which high dose FVIII infusions are administered over prolonged periods to suppress Ab production by memory B lymphocytes (10Brackmann H.H.

Regrettably, there is no single immunodominant FVIII epitope, and these approaches do not adequately address the problem of diverse epitope reactivities of the Abs.The combining sites of certain Abs contain enzyme-like activated nucleophiles. The Ab nucleophilic reactivities were evident from formation of covalent complexes with electrophilic phosphonate diesters (14Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.X. Nishiyama Y.

Powers J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 423-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The phosphonates react with activated nucleophiles generated by intramolecular interactions between certain amino acids. For instance, the Ser side chain acquires enhanced nucleophilicity by virtue of the hydrogen-bonded network in the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triads of serine proteases (18Bertrand J.A. Oleksyszyn J. Kam C.M. Boduszek B. Presnell S. Plaskon R.R. Suddath F.L. Powers J.C. Williams L.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3147-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The nucleophilic sites permit certain Abs to catalyze the hydrolysis of their cognate antigens (19Paul S. Volle D.J. Beach C.M. Johnson D.R. Powell M.J. Massey R.J. Science. 1989; 244: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Ser-His-Asp and Ser-Arg-Glu catalytic triads have been identified in proteolytic Abs by site-directed mutagenesis (20Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and crystallography studies (21Ramsland P.A. Terzyan S.S. Cloud G. Bourne C.R. Farrugia W. Tribbick G. Geysen H.M. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Edmundson A.B. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nucleophilic catalytic Abs that hydrolyze FVIII and inhibit FVIII cofactor activity are found in HA patients (3Lacroix-Desmazes S. Moreau A. Sooryanarayana Bonnemain C. Stieltjes N. Pashov A. Sultan Y. Hoebeke J. Kazatchkine M.D. Kaveri S.V. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1044-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, only a subset of nucleophilic Abs displays catalytic activity (14Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that additional events in the catalytic cycle occurring after the initial nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond carbonyl group can be rate-limiting (e.g. water attack and product release).We hypothesize that electrophilic FVIII (E-FVIII) analogs may relieve the anti-coagulant effect of Abs by reacting specifically and covalently with their nucleophilic sites. The covalent reaction is predicted to preclude dissociation of the immune complexes, thereby permitting prolonged Ab inactivation. We describe here E-FVIII analogs that relieve the FVIII inhibitory effect of Abs from patients with HA. E-FVIII is a prototypic therapeutic reagent for control of bleeding in inhibitor-positive HA patients. The observed properties of E-FVIII suggest that electrophilic antagonism can potentially be developed as a general basis for attaining specific inactivation of various antigen-specific pathogenic Abs found in immunological diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESElectrophilic FVIII Analogs—Recombinant FVIII (Helixate, CSL Behring) in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% Tween 20 was derivatized at Lys residues with the 3-sulfosuccinimidyl ester of diphenyl N-suberoyl-amino(4-amidinophenyl)methanephosphonate, and unincorporated phosphonate was removed by gel filtration (16Paul S.

The phosphonate content of three E-FVIII preparations employed in this study was 52–76 mol of phosphonate/mol of FVIII determined by fluorescamine labeling of the residual amine groups (16Paul S.

To prepare biotinylated E-proteins, biotin was first introduced into recombinant FVIII and C2 protein (22Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) by partial acylation in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CHAPS (14Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This yielded FVIII and C2, respectively, containing 8.8 and 0.6 mol of biotin/mol of protein. Phosphonate labeling of biotinylated FVIII was as above (81 mol of phosphonate/mol of protein). Fast protein liquid chromatography-gel filtration of E-FVIII was on a Superose-6 column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min as described (23Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B.

Initial attempts to prepare E-C2 as described above for E-FVIII resulted in precipitation of the protein (>90%). Therefore, a phosphonate reagent with a more hydrophilic linker was prepared by treating diphenyl amino(4-amidinophenyl)methanephosphonate with di(N-succinimidyl) ethylene glycol disuccinate (Sigma), followed by reversed phase HPLC purification (observed m/z 722.5 (MH+) and calculated MH+ 722.2). Treatment of biotinylated C2 with this reagent yielded E-C2 preparations containing 6.7–8.2 mol of phosphonate/mol of C2. The E-VIP preparation has been described (15Nishiyama Y. Bhatia G. Bangale Y.

The following peptides were prepared by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-based solid phase synthesis: FVIII residues 484–508 with a Cys residue at the N terminus (N-acetyl-CRPLYSRRLPKGVKHLKDFPILPGEI); residues 1804–1819 (KNFVKPNETKTYFWKV); FVIII residues 2303–2332 with lysyl-biotin at the C terminus (TRYLRIHPQSWVHQIALKMEVLGCEAQDLYK-biotinamidohexanoyl); and the mimotope of a C2 epitope recognized by monoclonal Ab BO2C11 (SCHAWSNRRTCR) (12Villard S.

The peptides were purified by HPLC (>95% purity) and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) or electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectroscopy (FVIII-(484–508), m/z (MALDI) 3076.0 (MH+; calculated MH+ 3075.7); FVIII-(2303–2332), m/z (ESI) 1356.2 (MH33+, calculated MH33+ 1356.4), 1018.0 (MH44+, 1017.5), and 814.5 (MH55+, 814.2); FVIII-(1804–1819), m/z (ESI) 677.4 (MH33+, calculated MH33+ 677.4), and 508.5 (MH44+; 508.3); BO2C11 epitope: m/z (MALDI) 1474.8 (MH+; calculated MH+ 1474.7)).

The resin with the 2303–2332 peptide protected at Lys-2320 side chain with the 4-methyltrityl group was treated with 1% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane to remove this protecting group, and the Lys-2320 side chain amine was acylated with the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of the phosphonate reagent used for E-FVIII preparation. Protecting groups and the solid support were removed with trifluoroacetic acid containing 2% phenol, 5% thioanisole, and 5% ethanedithiol, and E-(2303–2332) was purified by HPLC (m/z (ESI) 1529.5 (MH33+, calculated MH33+ 1529.5), 1147.3 (MH44+, 1147.4), 917.6 (MH55+, 918.1)]. The electrophilic analogs were stored at –80 °C as lyophilized powders. Protein concentrations were measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay.Patients and Antibodies—This study was approved by the University of Texas Institutional Review Board. Plasma was prepared from blood in 3.2% sodium citrate from 8 inhibitor-positive HA patients (our lab codes: HA1828, HA1834, HA1835, HA2084, HA2085, HA2222, HA2223, and HA3112; age range 5–59 years). The patients had a history of FVIII inhibitors for at least 5 years but had not received FVIII replacement therapy for at least 2 months prior to the blood draw). The plasma FVIII titers were determined by Bethesda assay (24Kasper C.K. Pool J.G. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1975; 34: 875-876PubMed Google Scholar) and are reported in Table 1. Control plasma was from a nonhemophiliac human subject without known coagulation or autoimmune disorders (code NH1941). Electrophoretically homogeneous IgG from the plasma samples was purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized protein G (25Paul S. Said S.I. Thompson A.B. Volle D.J. Agrawal D.K.

The reaction mixtures were boiled (5 min) in 2% SDS and 3.3% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-electrophoresis. Adducts were detected and quantified in gel blots with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin or goat anti-human IgG (Fc and κ/λ chain-specific, 1:1000; Sigma (16Paul S. Planque S. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H.

ELISAs were done using microtiter plates (Nunc) coated with 0.1 ml of FVIII, E-FVIII, C2, E-C2 (1 μg/ml), or synthetic FVIII peptides (4 μg/ml) in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.5, and blocked with 5% skimmed milk in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween).

Binding to biotinylated E-(2303–2332) was measured similarly using streptavidin-coated plates (1 μg/ml). To measure irreversible binding, Abs were permitted to bind the immobilized antigens; the fluid was removed, and the wells were incubated for 30 min in PBS/Tween without (total binding) or with 2% SDS (SDS-refractory binding), followed by washing with PBS/Tween (16Paul S.

Percent residual binding in SDS-treated wells was (A490, SDS-treated wells) × 100/(A490, PBS/Tween-treated wells). Samples displaying A490 > mean ± 3 S.D. for control IgG (from subject NH1941) were considered positive. Binding rate data were fitted to the equation A490/A490,max = 1 – exp(– Kt), where K is the pseudo-first order rate constant (K = (k3 × [Ab])/Kd); k3 is the first order rate constant for covalent bonding; Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for noncovalent binding step; [Ab] is the Ab concentration). t½ was computed as ln2/K. In the immunoadsorption experiment, HA IgG (0.7 μm) was incubated in diluent or biotinylated E-FVIII (0.1 μm) for 20 h, and the reaction mixture (0.04 ml) was incubated for 1 h with immobilized streptavidin in spin columns (30 μl of settled gel, UltraLink Plus columns, Pierce). The unbound fraction and three washes (0.05 ml each) were pooled and assayed for binding to FVIII and E-FVIII by ELISA.Clotting Factor Assays—FVIII and E-FVIII cofactor activity was determined using the Diapharma Coamatic FVIII kit® as instructed by the manufacturer using 0.045-ml solutions of the proteins in HEPES/Tween. The method measures the ability of FVIIIa generated by thrombin cleavage to form the FIXa tenase complex responsible for FXa generation, which in turn hydrolyzes the chromogenic substrate N-α-Z-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide. To measure FVIII inhibitor activity of Abs, IgG preparations from patients HA1828 (0.2 mg/ml), HA2222 (0.1 mg/ml), and HA3112 (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated with diluent or the electrophilic FVIII analogs in HEPES/Tween (0.1 ml; 20 h, 37 °C). Unbound electrophilic analogs in the reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) were removed by chromatography on protein G-Sepharose (0.04 ml of settled gel packed in Micro Biospin columns, Bio-Rad). The columns were washed with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CHAPS. Bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7, 0.1 mm CHAPS (0.2 ml) in tubes containing 0.01 ml of 1 m Tris base, pH 9. The FVIII inhibitory activity of eluates was determined using the Coamatic assay or the one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) clotting assay using APTT-SP reagent (29Ten Boekel E.

The standard curve was constructed from the clotting times of reference FVIII-containing plasma diluted in FVIII-depleted plasma (both from George King Bio-Medical, Inc.). Prior to the chromogenic FVIII inhibitor assay, FVIII (0.2 IU/ml, 0.025 ml) was incubated with the IgG eluates from protein G columns (0.025 ml; 1 h). Prior to the APTT clotting assay, pooled plasma from normal subjects (0.06 ml) was incubated with the IgG eluates (0.06 ml; 2 h). The concentrations of the FVIII inhibitory IgG in these assays yielded FVIII inhibition in the linear range of the inhibition curve (25–75% residual activity of reference FVIII-containing plasma).RESULTSE-FVIII and E-C2—Multiple electrophilic phosphonate groups were placed on FVIII and C2 Lys residues (E-FVIII, 52 mol/mol; E-C2, 7 mol/mol; total available Lys residues, respectively, 158 and 9; Fig. 1A), producing diverse electrophilic epitopes. Reducing SDS-electrophoresis and silver staining of E-C2 indicated a single band with mass similar to underivatized C2 (18.6 kDa; Fig. 1B, lane 3). SDS gels of E-FVIII revealed major 225- and 86-kDa bands (respectively, intact FVIII and FVIII light chain), minor ∼96–200-kDa bands corresponding to known proteolytic FVIII fragments (3Lacroix-Desmazes S.

Nanda R.K. J. Biosci. 2003; 28: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and smeared aggregate bands (nominal mass values ∼350 and 580 kDa close to the loading position; Fig. 1B, lane 1). Other than the aggregates, these bands were present in underivatized FVIII obtained from the supplier (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The aggregates constituted 21–32% of the total silver-stainable protein present in three preparations of E-FVIII examined.We reported recently the presence of nucleophilic sites in various nonenzymatic proteins, evident from their covalent reaction with small molecule phosphonate diester compounds (E-haptens) containing a positive charge neighboring the electrophilic phosphorus atom (31Nishiyama Y.

The presence of a naturally occurring nucleophilic site(s) in FVIII was suggested by the formation of a major 225-kDa adduct and a faint 86-kDa adduct of FVIII treated with a positively charged E-hapten-1 (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Only faint adduct bands were observed in reaction mixtures containing the poorly electrophilic control phosphonic acid (E-hapten-2) or the neutral phosphonate E-hapten-3. Control ovalbumin, a protein with minimal nucleophilic reactivity (31Nishiyama Y. Mitsuda Y. Taguchi H. Planque S. Hara M. Karle S. Hanson C.V. Uda T. Paul S. J. Mol. Recognit. 2005; 18: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), did not form detectable E-hapten-1 adducts. The E-FVIII aggregates may therefore be interpreted to derive from intermolecular covalent bonding between the electrophilic phosphonate and a naturally occurring nucleophilic site(s) of FVIII.To assess antigenic integrity, the binding of E-FVIII and E-C2 by Abs was determined by ELISA using affinity-purified IgG preparations from eight HA patients positive for FVIII inhibitory antibodies. All of the IgG preparations at 25 μg/ml displayed E-FVIII and E-C2 binding exceeding the mean ± 3 S.D. values for control IgG from the nonhemophilia subject (code NH1941; A490, respectively, 0.01 ± 0.01 and 0.07 ± 0.01). The IgG concentrations yielding an A490 value of 0.25 computed from dose-response curves are reported in Table 1. Fast protein liquid chromatography-gel filtration of E-FVIII permitted separation of an aggregate peak eluting close to the column void volume (retention time 18.3–21.6 min; 13% of protein loaded on the column) from unaggregated E-FVIII (retention time 43.3–46.0 min). The aggregates did not display reduced reactivity with IgG from an HA patient (HA1828) compared with unfractionated E-FVIII (A490 1.22 ± 0.02 and 0.85 ± 0.10, respectively; 30 μg/ml IgG, 93 ng/well E-FVIII aggregates or unfractionated FVIII), suggesting that the Ab-reactive epitopes aggregates are present in the aggregates. The ability of E-FVIII to consume anti-FVIII Abs was measured following solution phase reactions of HA1828 IgG with biotinylated E-FVIII. Immune complexes were removed using immobilized streptavidin, and free Abs in the unbound fraction were measured. This procedure resulted in es"
