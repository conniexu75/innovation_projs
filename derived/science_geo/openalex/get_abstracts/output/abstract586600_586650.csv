https://openalex.org/W2613751647,"Biochar production and use are part of the modern agenda to recycle wastes, and to retain nutrients, pollutants, and heavy metals in the soil and to offset some greenhouse gas emissions. Biochars from wood (eucalyptus sawdust, pine bark), sugarcane bagasse, and substances rich in nutrients (coffee husk, chicken manure) produced at 350, 450 and 750°C were characterized to identify agronomic and environmental benefits, which may enhance soil quality. Biochars derived from wood and sugarcane have greater potential for improving C storage in tropical soils due to a higher aromatic character, high C concentration, low H/C ratio, and FTIR spectra features as compared to nutrient-rich biochars. The high ash content associated with alkaline chemical species such as KHCO3 and CaCO3, verified by XRD analysis, made chicken manure and coffee husk biochars potential liming agents for remediating acidic soils. High Ca and K contents in chicken manure and coffee husk biomass can significantly replace conventional sources of K (mostly imported in Brazil) and Ca, suggesting a high agronomic value for these biochars. High-ash biochars, such as chicken manure and coffee husk, produced at low-temperatures (350 and 450°C) exhibited high CEC values, which can be considered as a potential applicable material to increase nutrient retention in soil. Therefore, the agronomic value of the biochars in this study is predominantly regulated by the nutrient richness of the biomass, but an increase in pyrolysis temperature to 750°C can strongly decrease the adsorptive capacities of chicken manure and coffee husk biochars. A diagram of the agronomic potential and environmental benefits is presented, along with some guidelines to relate biochar properties with potential agronomic and environmental uses. Based on biochar properties, research needs are identified and directions for future trials are delineated."
https://openalex.org/W2612603124,"Background The conventional measurement of obesity utilises the body mass index (BMI) criterion. Although there are benefits to this method, there is concern that not all individuals at risk of obesity-associated medical conditions are being identified. Whole-body fat percentage (%FM), and specifically visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass, are correlated with and potentially implicated in disease trajectories, but are not fully accounted for through BMI evaluation. The aims of this study were (a) to compare five anthropometric predictors of %FM and VAT mass, and (b) to explore new cut-points for the best of these predictors to improve the characterisation of obesity. Methods BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and waist/height0.5 (WHT.5R) were measured and calculated for 81 adults (40 women, 41 men; mean (SD) age: 38.4 (17.5) years; 94% Caucasian). Total body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry with Corescan (GE Lunar iDXA, Encore version 15.0) was also performed to quantify %FM and VAT mass. Linear regression analysis, stratified by sex, was applied to predict both %FM and VAT mass for each anthropometric variable. Within each sex, we used information theoretic methods (Akaike Information Criterion; AIC) to compare models. For the best anthropometric predictor, we derived tentative cut-points for classifying individuals as obese (>25% FM for men or >35% FM for women, or > highest tertile for VAT mass). Results The best predictor of both %FM and VAT mass in men and women was WHtR. Derived cut-points for predicting whole body obesity were 0.53 in men and 0.54 in women. The cut-point for predicting visceral obesity was 0.59 in both sexes. Conclusions In the absence of more objective measures of central obesity and adiposity, WHtR is a suitable proxy measure in both women and men. The proposed DXA-%FM and VAT mass cut-offs require validation in larger studies, but offer potential for improvement of obesity characterisation and the identification of individuals who would most benefit from therapeutic intervention."

This rise is not fully accounted for by increases in clinical factors which indicate the need for CS. We investigated the socio-demographic predictors of CS and the average annual rates of CS in Bangladesh between 2004 and 2014.Data were derived from four waves of nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) conducted between 2004 and 2014. Rate of change analysis was used to calculate the average annual rate of increase in CS from 2004 to 2014, by socio-demographic categories. Multi-level logistic regression was used to identify the socio-demographic predictors of CS in a cross-sectional analysis of the 2014 BDHS data.CS rates increased from 3.5% in 2004 to 23% in 2014. The average annual rate of increase in CS was higher among women of advanced maternal age (≥35 years), urban areas, and relatively high socio-economic status; with higher education, and who regularly accessed antenatal services. The multi-level logistic regression model indicated that lower (≤19) and advanced maternal age (≥35), urban location, relatively high socio-economic status, higher education, birth of few children (≤2), antenatal healthcare visits, overweight or obese were the key factors associated with increased utilization of CS. Underweight was a protective factor for CS.The use of CS has increased considerably in Bangladesh over the survey years. This rising trend and the risk of having CS vary significantly across regions and socio-economic status. Very high use of CS among women of relatively high socio-economic status and substantial urban-rural difference call for public awareness and practice guideline enforcement aimed at optimizing the use of CS."
https://openalex.org/W2612510556,"The gut microbiome of herbivorous animals consists of organisms that efficiently digest the structural carbohydrates of ingested plant material. Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) provide an interesting model of change in these microbial communities because they undergo a pronounced shift from a surface-pelagic distribution and omnivorous diet to a neritic distribution and herbivorous diet. As an alternative to direct sampling of the gut, we investigated the cloacal microbiomes of juvenile green turtles before and after recruitment to neritic waters to observe any changes in their microbial community structure. Cloacal swabs were taken from individual turtles for analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences using Illumina sequencing. One fecal sample was also obtained, allowing for a preliminary comparison with the bacterial community of the cloaca. We found significant variation in the juvenile green turtle bacterial communities between pelagic and neritic habitats, suggesting that environmental and dietary factors support different bacterial communities in green turtles from these habitats. This is the first study to characterize the cloacal microbiome of green turtles in the context of their ontogenetic shifts, which could provide valuable insight into the origins of their gut bacteria and how the microbial community supports their shift to herbivory."
https://openalex.org/W2613245199,"Aim To verify the probability of maintaining functional capacity in basic activities of daily living and identify the prognostic factors of functional decline in institutionalized older adults. Methods A longitudinal study is presented herein, with 5 waves every 6 months, throughout 2 years (2013–2015), conducted with individuals ≥60 years old in 10 nursing homes in the city of Natal-RN (Brazil). Functional capacity was assessed by the items ‘eating’, ‘personal hygiene’, ‘dressing’, ‘bathing’, ‘transferring’, ‘toileting’ and ‘walking’, through a 5-item Likert scale. Sociodemographic, institution-related and health-related variables were considered to establish the baseline. Time dependent variables included continence decline, cognitive decline, increase in the number of medication, and incidences of falls, hospitalizations and fractures. The actuarial method, the log-rank test and Cox's regression were applied as statistical methods. Results The cumulative probability of functional maintenance was 78.2% (CI 95%: 72.8–82.7%), 65.1% (CI 95%: 58.9–70.5%), 53.5% (CI 95%: 47.2–59.5%) and 44.0% (CI 95%: 37.7–50.2%) at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, respectively. Predicting factors for functional decline were: severe cognitive impairment (HR = 1.96; p = 0.001), continence decline (HR = 1.85; p = 0.002) and incidence of hospitalizations (HR = 1.62; p = 0.020), adjusted by the incidence of depression, age, education level, presence of chronic diseases and low weight. Conclusions The cumulative probability of maintaining functional capacity in institutionalized older adults was only 44% at the 2-year follow-up. Prognostic factors for functional decline included severe cognitive impairment, continence decline and incidence of hospitalizations."
https://openalex.org/W2612373150,"Low tidal volume (VT) during anesthesia minimizes lung injury but may be associated to a decrease in functional lung volume impairing lung mechanics and efficiency. Lung recruitment (RM) can restore lung volume but this may critically depend on the post-RM selected PEEP. This study was a randomized, two parallel arm, open study whose primary outcome was to compare the effects on driving pressure of adding a RM to low-VT ventilation, with or without an individualized post-RM PEEP in patients without known previous lung disease during anesthesia.Consecutive patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery were submitted to low-VT ventilation (6 ml·kg-1) and standard PEEP of 5 cmH2O (pre-RM, n = 36). After 30 min estabilization all patients received a RM and were randomly allocated to either continue with the same PEEP (RM-5 group, n = 18) or to an individualized open-lung PEEP (OL-PEEP) (Open Lung Approach, OLA group, n = 18) defined as the level resulting in maximal Cdyn during a decremental PEEP trial. We compared the effects on driving pressure and lung efficiency measured by volumetric capnography.OL-PEEP was found at 8±2 cmH2O. 36 patients were included in the final analysis. When compared with pre-RM, OLA resulted in a 22% increase in compliance and a 28% decrease in driving pressure when compared to pre-RM. These parameters did not improve in the RM-5. The trend of the DP was significantly different between the OLA and RM-5 groups (p = 0.002). VDalv/VTalv was significantly lower in the OLA group after the RM (p = 0.035).Lung recruitment applied during low-VT ventilation improves driving pressure and lung efficiency only when applied as an open-lung strategy with an individualized PEEP in patients without lung diseases undergoing major abdominal surgery.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02798133."
https://openalex.org/W2612427701,"Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT), as a novel and effective therapeutic modality to eradicate drug resistant bacteria without provoking multidrug resistance, has attracted increasing attention. This study examined the antimicrobial efficacy of the novel cationic amino acid-porphyrin conjugate 4I with four lysine groups against two different clinical isolated strains (drug sensitive and multidrug resistant) of the Acinetobacter baumannii species and its toxicity on murine dermal fibroblasts in vitro, as well as the therapeutic effect of PACT on acute, potentially lethal multidrug resistant strain excisional wound infections in vivo. The PACT protocol exposed 4I to illumination, exhibiting high antimicrobial efficacy on two different strains due to a high yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and non-selectivity to microorganisms. The photoinactivation effects of 4I against two different strains were dose-dependent. At 3.9 μM and 7.8 μM, PACT induced 6 log units of inactivation of sensitive and multidrug resistant strains. In contrast, 4I alone and illumination alone treatments had no visibly antimicrobial effect. Moreover, cytotoxicity tests revealed the great safety of the photosensitizer 4I in mice. In the in vivo study, we found 4I-mediated PACT was not only able to kill bacteria but also accelerated wound recovery. Compared with non-treated mice, over 2.89 log reduction of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain was reached in PACT treat mice at 24 h post-treatment. These results imply that 4I-mediated PACT therapy is an effective and safe alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy and has clinical potential for superficial drug-resistant bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2612348752,"Many freshwater lakes undergo seasonal stratification, where the formation of phototrophic blooms in the epilimnion and subsequent sedimentation induces hypoxia/anoxia in the thermocline and hypolimnion. This autochthonously produced biomass represents a major seasonal organic input that impacts the entire ecosystem. While the limnological aspects of this process are fairly well documented, relatively little is known regarding the microbial community response to such events, especially in the deeper anoxic layers of the water column. Here, we conducted a spatiotemporal survey of the particle-associated and free-living microbial communities in a warm monomictic freshwater reservoir (Grand Lake O' the Cherokees) in northeastern Oklahoma, USA. Pre-stratification samples (March) harbored a homogeneous community throughout the oxygenated water column dominated by typical oligotrophic aquatic lineages (acl clade within Actinobacteria, and Flavobacterium within the Bacteroidetes). The onset of phototrophic blooming in June induced the progression of this baseline community into two distinct trajectories. Within the oxic epilimnion, samples were characterized by the propagation of phototrophic (Prochlorococcus), and heterotrophic (Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Beta-Proteobacteria) lineages. Within the oxygen-deficient thermocline and hypolimnion, the sedimentation of surface biomass induced the development of a highly diverse community, with the enrichment of Chloroflexi, ""Latescibacteria"", Armatimonadetes, and Delta-Proteobacteria in the particle-associated fraction, and Gemmatimonadetes and ""Omnitrophica"" in the free-living fraction. Our work documents the development of multiple spatially and temporally distinct niches during lake stratification, and supports the enrichment of multiple yet-uncultured and poorly characterized lineages in the lake's deeper oxygen-deficient layers, an ecologically relevant microbial niche that is often overlooked in lakes diversity surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2612050787,"Metastasis is the ultimate cause of breast cancer related mortality. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to play a crucial role in the metastatic potential of breast cancer. Growing evidence has implicated the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 in the regulation of EMT in mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer metastasis. However, the relevance of PIAS1 in human cancer and mechanisms by which PIAS1 might regulate breast cancer metastasis remain to be elucidated. Using tissue-microarray analysis (TMA), we report that the protein abundance and subcellular localization of PIAS1 correlate with disease specific overall survival of a cohort of breast cancer patients. In mechanistic studies, we find that PIAS1 acts via sumoylation of the transcriptional regulator SnoN to suppress invasive growth of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell-derived organoids. Our studies thus identify the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, and suggest a potential role for the PIAS1-SnoN sumoylation pathway in controlling breast cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2613578233,"Three experiments (total N = 464) were conducted in parallel with English- and German-speaking participants to examine the perceived meanings and effects of the labels ""victim"" versus ""survivor"" (and their German equivalents) when applied to a woman who was raped. In Study 1 (N = 179), participants read a rape vignette and then rated the meaning of the label it contained (either ""victim"" or ""survivor"") on a 15-item semantic differential. Independent of language and participant gender, ""survivor"" was perceived more positively overall (e.g., as strong, brave, active) than was ""victim"" (weak, passive, but also innocent). In Study 2 (N = 95), labels were varied within items assessing judgments of an acquaintance-rape case (e.g., ""Does the victim [survivor] … carry a certain responsibility for what happened?""), focusing on short-term outcomes. Significant interaction effects of label and participants’ gender emerged on case-related judgments. Participants in both language samples judged ""survivor"" to be a less appropriate term than ""victim"". In Study 3 (N = 190), participants read a text in which a woman who had been raped labeled herself as either ""victim"" or ""survivor"", focusing on the coping with sexual violence. As in Study 2, German-language participants showed no significant effects of the label on their case judgments but rejected the term ""survivor"" as inappropriate; English-language participants, by contrast, perceived the woman describing herself as ""survivor"" to be more psychologically stable and regarded the use of both labels as appropriate. Results are discussed in terms of their applied relevance for communicating about sexual violence."
https://openalex.org/W2613084902,"Bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.], an important turfgrass used in public parks, home lawns, golf courses and sports fields, is widely distributed in China. In the present study, sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers were used to assess genetic diversity and population structure among 157 indigenous bermudagrass genotypes from 20 provinces in China. The application of 26 SRAP primer pairs produced 340 bands, of which 328 (96.58%) were polymorphic. The polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.36 to 0.49 with a mean of 0.44. Genetic distance coefficients among accessions ranged from 0.04 to 0.61, with an average of 0.32. The results of STRUCTURE analysis suggested that 157 bermudagrass accessions can be grouped into three subpopulations. Moreover, according to clustering based on the unweighted pair-group method of arithmetic averages (UPGMA), accessions were divided into three major clusters. The UPGMA dendrogram revealed that accessions from identical or adjacent areas were generally, but not entirely, clustered into the same cluster. Comparison of the UPGMA dendrogram and the Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis showed general agreement between the population subdivisions and the genetic relationships among accessions. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) with SRAP markers revealed a similar grouping of accessions to the UPGMA dendrogram and STRUCTUE analysis. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 18% of total molecular variance was attributed to diversity among subpopulations, while 82% of variance was associated with differences within subpopulations. Our study represents the most comprehensive investigation of the genetic diversity and population structure of bermudagrass in China to date, and provides valuable information for the germplasm collection, genetic improvement, and systematic utilization of bermudagrass."
https://openalex.org/W2612054083,"Neurogenesis is a highly-regulated process occurring in the dentate gyrus that has been linked to learning, memory, and antidepressant efficacy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been previously shown to play an important role in the regulation of neuronal development and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus via modulation of gene expression. However, this mode of regulation is both incompletely described in the literature thus far and highly multifactorial. In this study, we designed sensors and detected relative levels of expression of 10 different miRNAs and found miR-338-3p was most highly expressed in the dentate gyrus. Comparison of miR-338-3p expression with neuronal markers of maturity indicates miR-338-3p is expressed most highly in the mature neuron. We also designed a viral ""sponge"" to knock down in vivo expression of miR-338-3p. When miR-338-3p is knocked down, neurons sprout multiple primary dendrites that branch off of the soma in a disorganized manner, cellular proliferation is upregulated, and neoplasms form spontaneously in vivo. Additionally, miR-338-3p overexpression in glioblastoma cell lines slows their proliferation in vitro. Further, low miR-338-3p expression is associated with increased mortality and disease progression in patients with glioblastoma. These data identify miR-338-3p as a clinically relevant tumor suppressor in glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2612660060,"Background Maternal mortality and morbidity are public health problems in Nepal. In rural communities, many women give birth at home without the support of a skilled birth attendant, despite the existence of rural birthing centers. The aim of this study was to explore the barriers and provide pragmatic recommendations for better service delivery and use of rural birthing centers. Methods We conducted 26 in-depth interviews with service users and providers, and three focus group discussions with community key informants in a rural community of Rukum district. We used the Adithya Cattamanchi logic model as a guiding framework for data analysis. Results Irregular and poor quality services, inadequate human and capital resources, and poor governance were health system challenges which prevented service delivery. Contextual barriers including difficult geography, poor birth preparedness practices, harmful culture practices and traditions and low level of trust were also found to contribute to underutilization of the birthing center. Conclusion The rural birthing center was not providing quality services when women were in need, which meant women did not use the available services properly because of systematic and contextual barriers. Approaches such as awareness-raising activities, local resource mobilization, ensuring access to skilled providers and equipment and other long-term infrastructure development works could improve the quality and utilization of childbirth services in the rural birthing center. This has resonance for other centers in Nepal and similar countries."

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) affirmed that among the different combinations of fungal and organic fertilizer treatments, the phenolic acids and flavonoids were considerably enriched in organic fertilizer and fungi (OP) followed by organic fertilizer, biochar, fungi (OBP) treated plants. The antiradical activity was higher in OP (61.29%) followed by P (60%) and organic fertilizer (OF) (53.84%) inoculated plants which positively correlated with chlorophyll, carotenoids and flavonoids level (P<0.05). Furthermore, results showed that the exogenous application of P. indica significantly (P<0.05) enhanced plant growth, as well as stimulating the activation of chlorophyll, carotenoids and other antioxidant related pathways. The RT-qPCR analysis indicated that key FLS gene triggering the synthesis of kaemferol was up-regulated by the inoculation of P. indica. In conclusion, the results revealed that organic fertilizer and P. indica (OP) is the most appropriate combination for improving phytochemical and antiradical properties in Pakchoi."

In the current project, we distributed the Biological Concepts Instrument (BCI) to 17-18-year-old students attending the highest track of the Swiss school system (Gymnasium). Students’ performances on many questions related to evolution, genetics, molecular properties and functions were diverse. Important common misunderstandings were identified in the areas of evolutionary processes, molecular properties and an appreciation of stochastic processes in biological systems. Our observations provide further evidence that the BCI is efficient in identifying specific areas where targeted instruction is required. Based on these observations we have initiated changes at several levels to reconsider how biological systems are presented to university biology studies with the goal of improving student’s foundational understanding."
https://openalex.org/W2613520161,"Cassava is the third largest food crop of the world and has strong ability of drought tolerance. In order to evaluate the molecular diversity and to discover novel alleles for drought tolerance in cassava germplasms, we examined a total of 107 abiotic stress related expressed sequence tags—simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers in 134 cassava genotypes coming from planting regions worldwide and performed drought related marker-traits association mapping. As results, we successfully amplified 98 of 107 markers in 97 polymorphic loci and 279 alleles, with 2.87 alleles per locus, gene diversity of 0.48 and polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.41 on average. The genetic coefficient between every two lines was 0.37 on average, ranging from 0.21 to 0.82. According to our population structure analysis, these samples could be divided into three sub-populations showing obvious gene flow between them. We also performed water stress experiments using 100-day old cassava plants in two years and calculated the drought tolerance coefficients (DTCs) and used them as phenotypes for marker-trait association mapping. We found that 53 markers were significantly associated with these drought-related traits, with a contribution rate for trait variation of 8.60% on average, ranging between 2.66 and 28.09%. Twenty-four of these 53 associated genes showed differential transcription or protein levels which were confirmed by qRT-PCR under drought stress when compared to the control conditions in cassava. Twelve of twenty-four genes were the same differential expression patterns in omics data and results of qRT-PCR. Out of 33 marker-traits combinations on 24 loci, 34 were positive and 53 negative alleles according to their phenotypic effects and we also obtained the typical materials which carried these elite alleles. We also found 23 positive average allele effects while 10 loci were negative according to their allele effects (AAEs). Our results on molecular diversity, locus association and differential expression under drought can prove beneficial to select excellent materials through marker assisted selection and for functional genes research in the future."

https://openalex.org/W2613246602,"Soybean biodiesel (B100) has been playing an important role in Brazilian energy matrix towards the national bio-based economy. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the most widely used indicator for assessing the environmental sustainability of biodiesels and received particular attention among decision makers in business and politics, as well as consumers. Former studies have been mainly focused on the GHG emissions from the soybean cultivation, excluding other stages of the biodiesel production. Here, we present a holistic view of the total GHG emissions in four life cycle stages for soybean biodiesel. The aim of this study was to assess the GHG emissions of Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system with an integrated life cycle approach of four stages: agriculture, extraction, production and distribution. Allocation of mass and energy was applied and special attention was paid to the integrated and non-integrated industrial production chain. The results indicated that the largest source of GHG emissions, among four life cycle stages, is the agricultural stage (42–51%) for B100 produced in integrated systems and the production stage (46–52%) for B100 produced in non-integrated systems. Integration of industrial units resulted in significant reduction in life cycle GHG emissions. Without the consideration of LUC and assuming biogenic CO2 emissions is carbon neutral in our study, the calculated life cycle GHG emissions for domestic soybean biodiesel varied from 23.1 to 25.8 gCO2eq. MJ-1 B100 and those for soybean biodiesel exported to EU ranged from 26.5 to 29.2 gCO2eq. MJ-1 B100, which represent reductions by 65% up to 72% (depending on the delivery route) of GHG emissions compared with the EU benchmark for diesel fuel. Our findings from a life cycle perspective contributed to identify the major GHG sources in Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system and they can be used to guide mitigation priority for policy and decision-making. Projected scenarios in this study would be taken as references for accounting the environmental sustainability of soybean biodiesel within a domestic and global level."
https://openalex.org/W2613275228,"Ezrin belongs to the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family that has a role in cell morphology changes, adhesion and migration as an organizer of the cortical cytoskeleton by linking actin filaments to the apical membrane of epithelial cells. It is highly expressed in a variety of human cancers and promotes metastasis. Members of the Ca2+-binding EF-hand containing S100 proteins have similar pathological properties; they are overexpressed in cancer cells and involved in metastatic processes. In this study, using tryptophan fluorescence and stopped-flow kinetics, we show that S100A4 binds to the N-terminal ERM domain (N-ERMAD) of ezrin with a micromolar affinity. The binding involves the F2 lobe of the N-ERMAD and follows an induced fit kinetic mechanism. Interestingly, S100A4 binds also to the unstructured C-terminal actin binding domain (C-ERMAD) with similar affinity. Using NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the complex of S100A4 with the C-ERMAD and demonstrate that no ternary complex is simultaneously formed with the two ezrin domains. Furthermore, we show that S100A4 co-localizes with ezrin in HEK-293T cells. However, S100A4 very weakly binds to full-length ezrin in vitro indicating that the interaction of S100A4 with ezrin requires other regulatory events such as protein phosphorylation and/or membrane binding, shifting the conformational equilibrium of ezrin towards the open state. As both proteins play an important role in promoting metastasis, the characterization of their interaction could shed more light on the molecular events contributing to this pathological process."

However, most of the prospective randomized studies have very little follow-up compared to the long natural history of the disease. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the long-term survival of our series of patients with follicular lymphoma. Patients and methods A total of 1074 patients with newly diagnosed FL were enrolled. Patients diagnosed were prospectively enrolled from 1980 to 2013. Results Median follow-up was 54.9 months and median overall survival is over 20 years in our series. We analyzed the patients who are still alive beyond 10 years from diagnosis in order to fully assess the prognostic factors that condition this group. Out of 166 patients who are still alive after more than 10 years of follow-up, 118 of them (73%) are free of evident clinical disease. Variables significantly associated with survival at 10 years were stage < II (p <0.03), age < 60 years (p <0.0001), low FLIPI (p <0.002), normal β2 microglobulin (p <0.005), no B symptoms upon diagnosis (p <0.02), Performance Status 0–1 (p <0.03) and treatment with anthracyclines and rituximab (p <0.001), or rituximab (p <0.0001). Conclusions A longer follow-up and a large series demonstrated a substantial population of patients with follicular lymphoma free of disease for more than 10 years."
https://openalex.org/W2612420741,"It is commonly assumed that the dead, hardened floral bracts of the dispersal unit of grasses have been evolved to protect seeds from predation and / or assist in fruit/caryopsis dispersal. While these structures have important agronomical and economical implications, their adaptive value has not been fully explored. We investigated the hypothesis that the maternally derived hardened floral bracts have been evolved not just as a means for caryopsis protection and dispersal, but also as storage for substances that might affect seed germination and seedling vigor. Dead glumes as well as lemmas and paleas of wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum var dicoccoides) were found to store and release upon hydration active hydrolases including nucleases and chitinases. High nuclease activity was released upon hydration from glumes derived from wild strains of wheat including Triticum urartu and wild emmer wheat, while very low nuclease activity was detected in glumes derived from domesticated, free-threshing wheat cultivars (e.g., durum wheat). Germination from the intact dispersal unit of wild emmer wheat was delayed, but post germination growth was better than those of separated caryopses. Most notable was a significant increase in lateral root production on seedlings germinated from the intact dispersal unit. Proteome analysis of wild emmer wheat glumes revealed many proteins stored and released upon hydration including S1-type nucleases, peptidases, antifungal hydrolases such as chitinases and β-1,3-glucanase as well as pectin acetylesterase, a protein involved in cell wall degradation and remodeling. Also, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase were overrepresented in dead glumes of wild emmer wheat. Thus our study highlighted previously unknown features of the dispersal unit in wild wheat in which the dead, hardened floral bracts enclosing the caryopsis store active hydrolases and nutritional elements and probably growth promoting substances that facilitate seed longevity and germination and increase seedling vigor."

Of the 736 cattle in this study, 77 tested positive for antibodies against C. burnetii antigens (10.5%, 95% CI: 8.3–12.7) and 11 were positive for a C. burnetti infection on PCR analysis (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.6–2.4). Since the 16S rRNA sequences of C. burnetii from all 11 PCR-positive samples were identical, three representative samples (C-CN-3 from the southern region, C-JJ-9 from Jeju Island, and C-CB-37 from the central region) are described in this paper. These three sequences had 99.3–100% identity to those of C. burnetii deposited in GenBank. These sequences clustered with those from USA, Japan, and Greenland, underscoring the sequence similarity among C. burnetii isolates in these countries. Because C. burnetii was detected in cattle at well-managed national breeding stock farms, cattle at non-government operated farms may be more likely to be exposed to C. burnetii in South Korea. Thus, continuous surveillance and control strategies in animals and humans are required to prevent the transmission of C. burnetii to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2613871362,"Hyperglycemia in diabetes alters tight junction (TJ) proteins in the kidney. We evaluated the participation of aldosterone (ALD), and the effect of spironolactone (SPL), a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, on the expressions of claudin-2, -4, -5 and -8, and occludin in glomeruli, proximal and distal tubules isolated from diabetic rats. Type 1 diabetes was induced in female Wistar rats by a single tail vein injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and SPL was administrated daily by gavage, from days 3–21. Twenty-one days after STZ injection the rats were sacrificed. In diabetic rats, the serum ALD levels were increased, and SPL-treatment did not have effect on these levels or in hyperglycemia, however, proteinuria decreased in SPL-treated diabetic rats. Glomerular damage, evaluated by nephrin and Wilm’s tumor 1 (WT1) protein expressions, and proximal tubular damage, evaluated by kidney injury molecule 1 (Kim-1) and heat shock protein 72 kDa (Hsp72) expressions, were ameliorated by SPL. Also, SPL prevented decrement in claudin-5 in glomeruli, and claudin-2 and occludin in proximal tubules by decreasing oxidative stress, evaluated by superoxide anion (O2●―) production, and oxidative stress markers. In distal tubules, SPL ameliorated increase in mRNA, protein expression, and phosphorylation in threonine residues of claudin-4 and -8, through a serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1), and with-no-lysine kinase 4 (WNK4) signaling pathway. In conclusion, this is the first study that demonstrates that ALD modulates the expression of renal TJ proteins in diabetes, and that the blockade of its actions with SPL, may be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent alterations of TJ proteins in diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2613896964,"Objective Health care workers (HCWs) in contact with patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) are exposed to a risk of viral contamination. Fomites contaminated with the patient’s blood or body fluids represents this risk. Our study aims to detect Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA within the high- and low-risk areas of an Ebola treatment unit (ETU) located in inland Guinea during the 2014–2015 West African Ebola epidemics. For samples from patients’ immediate vicinity, we aim to seek an association between viral RNA detectability and level of plasma viral load of patients (intermediate to high, or very high). Methods Swabbing was performed on immediate vicinity of Ebola patients, on surfaces of an ETU, and on personal protective equipment (PPE) of HCWs after patient care and prior to doffing. All samples were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcribed PCR (RT-qPCR). Results 32% (22/68) of swabs from high-risk areas were tested positive for EBOV RNA, including 42% (18/43) from patients’ immediate vicinity, and 16% (4/25) from HCWs PPE. None of specimens from low-risk areas were tested positive (0/19). Swabs were much more often viral RNA positive in the vicinity of patients with a very high plasma viral load (OR 6.7, 95% CI [1.7–23.4]). Conclusion Our findings show the persistence of EBOV RNA in the environment of Ebola patients and of HCWs, in a Guinean ETU, despite strict infection prevention and control measures. This detection raises the possibility that patients’ environment could be a potential source of contamination with the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2612713919,"In this study, we investigated the inactivation efficacy of endospore-forming bacteria, Bacillus pumilus, irradiated by low-energy X-rays of different beam qualities. The different low-energy X-rays studied had cut-off energies of 50, 100 and 150 keV. Bacillus pumilus spores (in biological indicator strips) were irradiated at step doses between 6.5 to 390 Gy. The resulting bacteria populations were then quantified by a pour plate method. Results showed that X-rays of lower energies were more effective in inactivating bacterial spores. In addition, an increment in bacterial population was observed at doses below 13Gy. We attributed this increase to a radiation-induced activation of bacterial spores. Four kinetic models were then evaluated for their prediction of bacterial spore behavior under irradiation. This included: (i) first-order kinetics model; (ii) Shull model; (iii) Sapru model; and (iv) probabilistic model. From R2 and AIC analyses, we noted that the probabilistic model performed the best, followed by the Sapru model. We highlighted that for simplicity in curve fitting the Sapru model should be used instead of the probabilistic model. A 12-log reduction in bacterial population (corresponding to a sterility assurance level of 10−6 as required in the sterilization of medical devices) was computed to be achievable at doses of 1000, 1600 and 2300 Gy for the three different X-ray cut-off energies respectively. These doses are an order in magnitude lesser than that required in gamma irradiation. This highlights the applicability of cheaper and safer table-top X-ray sources for sterilization application."
https://openalex.org/W2612354499,"Rhodopsin is a light-driven G-protein-coupled receptor that mediates signal transduction in eyes. Internal water molecules mediate activation of the receptor in a rhodopsin cascade reaction and contribute to conformational stability of the receptor. However, it remains unclear how internal water molecules exchange between the bulk and protein inside, in particular through a putative solvent pore on the cytoplasmic. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we identified the solvent pore on cytoplasmic side in both the Meta II state and the Opsin. On the other hand, the solvent pore does not exist in the dark-adapted rhodopsin. We revealed two characteristic narrow regions located within the solvent pore in the Meta II state. The narrow regions distinguish bulk and the internal hydration sites, one of which is adjacent to the conserved structural motif “NPxxY”. Water molecules in the solvent pore diffuse by pushing or sometimes jumping a preceding water molecule due to the geometry of the solvent pore. These findings revealed a total water flux between the bulk and the protein inside in the Meta II state, and suggested that these pathways provide water molecules to the crucial sites of the activated rhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W2613243206,"A two-step modeling approach was used for predicting the effect of temperature on the growth of Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni, causal agent of bacterial spot disease of stone fruit. The in vitro growth of seven strains was monitored at temperatures from 5 to 35°C with a Bioscreen C system, and a calibrating equation was generated for converting optical densities to viable counts. In primary modeling, Baranyi, Buchanan, and modified Gompertz equations were fitted to viable count growth curves over the entire temperature range. The modified Gompertz model showed the best fit to the data, and it was selected to estimate the bacterial growth parameters at each temperature. Secondary modeling of maximum specific growth rate as a function of temperature was performed by using the Ratkowsky model and its variations. The modified Ratkowsky model showed the best goodness of fit to maximum specific growth rate estimates, and it was validated successfully for the seven strains at four additional temperatures. The model generated in this work will be used for predicting temperature-based Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni growth rate and derived potential daily doublings, and included as the inoculum potential component of a bacterial spot of stone fruit disease forecaster."
https://openalex.org/W2613674576,"The cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family, cleaves and activates the hemagglutinin of influenza A viruses (FLUAV) in cell culture and is essential for spread of diverse FLUAV in mice. Non-human primates (NHP), in particular rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, serve as animal models for influenza and experimental FLUAV infection of common marmosets has recently also been reported. However, it is currently unknown whether the NHP orthologues of human TMPRSS2 cleave and activate FLUAV hemagglutinin and contribute to viral spread in respiratory tissue. Here, we cloned and functionally analyzed the macaque and marmoset orthologues of human TMPRSS2. In addition, we analyzed the macaque orthologues of human TMPRSS4 and HAT, which also belong to the TTSP family. We found that all NHP orthologues of human TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT cleave and activate HA upon directed expression and provide evidence that endogenous TMPRSS2 is expressed in the respiratory epithelium of rhesus macaques. Finally, we demonstrate that a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 suppresses FLUAV spread in precision-cut lung slices of human, macaque and marmoset origin. These results indicate that FLUAV depends on serine protease activity for spread in diverse NHP and in humans. Moreover, our findings suggest that macaques and marmosets may serve as models to study FLUAV activation by TMPRSS2 in human patients."
https://openalex.org/W2613212307,"Objective To validate preoperative dynamic CT and fecal elastase-1 level in predicting the development of pancreatic fistulae after pancreatoduodenectomy. Materials and methods For 146 consecutive patients, CT attenuation values of the nontumorous pancreatic parenchyma were retrospectively measured on precontrast, arterial and equilibrium phase images for calculation of enhancement ratios. CT enhancement ratios and preoperative fecal elastase-1 levels were correlated with the development of pancreatic fistulae using independent t-test, logistic regression models, ROC analysis, Youden method and tree analysis. Results The mean value of enhancement ratio on equilibrium phase was significantly higher (p = 0.001) in the patients without pancreatic fistula (n = 107; 2.26±3.63) than in the patients with pancreatic fistula (n = 39; 1.04±0.51); in the logistic regression analyses, it was significant predictor for the development of pancreatic fistulae (odds ratio = 0.243, p = 0.002). The mean preoperative fecal elastase-1 levels were higher (odds ratio = 1.003, p = 0.034) in the pancreatic fistula patients than other patients, but there were no significant differences in the areas under the curve between the prediction values of CT enhancement ratios and fecal elastase-1 combined and those of CT enhancement ratios alone (P = 0.897, p = 0.917) on ROC curve analysis. Tree analysis revealed that the CT enhancement ratio was more powerful predictor of pancreatic fistula than fecal elastase-1 levels. Conclusion The preoperative CT enhancement ratio of pancreas acquired at equilibrium phase regardless of combination with fecal elastase-1 levels might be a useful predictor of the risk of developing a pancreatic fistula following pancreatoduodenectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2612964351,"We present a new concept, termed tissue lithography (TL), and its implementation which enables retrospective studies on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Tissue lithography uses a microfluidic probe to remove microscale areas of the paraffin layer on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy samples. Current practices in sample utilization for research and diagnostics require complete deparaffinization of the sample prior to molecular testing. This imposes strong limitations in terms of the number of tests as well as the time when they can be performed on a single sample. Microscale dewaxing lifts these constraints by permitting deprotection of a fraction of a tissue for testing while keeping the remaining of the sample intact for future analysis. After testing, the sample can be sent back to storage instead of being discarded, as is done in standard workflows. We achieve this microscale dewaxing by hydrodynamically confining nanoliter volumes of xylene on top of the sample with a probe head. We demonstrate micrometer-scale, chromogenic and fluorescence-based immunohistochemistry against multiple biomarkers (p53, CD45, HER2 and β-actin) on tonsil and breast tissue sections and microarrays. We achieve stain patterns as small as 100 μm × 50 μm as well as multiplexed immunostaining within a single tissue microarray core with a 20-fold time reduction for local dewaxing as compared to standard protocols. We also demonstrate a 10-fold reduction in the rehydration time, leading to lower processing times between different stains. We further show the potential of TL for retrospective studies by sequentially dewaxing and staining four individual cores within the same tissue microarray over four consecutive days. By combining tissue lithography with the concept of micro-immunohistochemistry, we implement each step of the IHC protocol-dewaxing, rehydration and staining-with the same microfluidic probe head. Tissue lithography brings a new level of versatility and flexibility in sample processing and budgeting in biobanks, which may alleviate current sample limitations for retrospective studies in biomarker discovery and drug screening."
https://openalex.org/W2612991079,"A rare hereditary mechanobullous disorder called epidermolysis bullosa (EB) causes blistering in the skin and the mucosal membranes. To date, nineteen EB-related genes have been discovered in human and other species. We describe here a novel EB variant in dogs. Two newborn littermates of Central Asian Shepherd dogs with severe signs of skin blistering were brought to a veterinary clinic and euthanized due to poor prognosis. In post-mortem examination, the puppies were shown to have findings in the skin and the mucosal membranes characteristic of EB. A whole-genome sequencing of one of the affected puppies was performed to identify the genetic cause. The resequencing data were filtered under a recessive model against variants from 31 other dog genomes, revealing a homozygous case-specific nonsense variant in one of the known EB-causing genes, COL7A1 (c.4579C>T, p.R1527*). The variant results in a premature stop codon and likely absence of the functional protein in the basement membrane of the skin in the affected dogs. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using a COL7A1 antibody. Additional screening of the variant indicated full penetrance and breed specificity at ~28% carrier frequency. In summary, this study reveals a novel COL7A1 variant causing recessive dystrophic EB and provides a genetic test for the eradication of the disease from the breed."
https://openalex.org/W2613155862,"Excessive neutrophil activation accompanied by delayed apoptotic cell death in inflammatory conditions causes progressive damage of cells and tissues, leading to life-threatening multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Previous work suggested that circulating serum factors during inflammation are critically involved in the suppression of neutrophil cell death although the identity of these antiapoptotic mediators remained elusive. In this study, we identified the acute phase protein α-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) as a potent suppressor of staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in human neutrophils through a mechanism implicating caspases-independent pathways. We show here that serum levels of AAT, potentially in part released by stimulated neutrophils, are markedly elevated in major trauma patients suffering from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Notably, AAT depletion from serum increased sensitivity of human neutrophils for STS-induced cell death. In fact, AAT was demonstrated to confer intrinsic apoptosis resistance by preventing PKC/Akt inactivation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein in response to STS treatment. Neither MAP kinase ERK1/2 nor caspases were found to be involved in AAT-triggered antiapoptotic pathways in neutrophils. In summary, these results establish a novel pivotal role of circulating AAT in mediating survival by antagonizing the proapoptotic action of the PKC inhibitor STS and should be considered for AAT augmentation therapies in future."
https://openalex.org/W2613454683,"Early repolarization syndrome (ERS) may be a near-Mendelian or an oligogenic disease; however, no direct evidence has been provided to support this theory.We described a large Chinese family with nocturnal sudden cardiac death induced by ERS in most of the young male adults. One missense mutation (p.Q1916R) was found in the major subunit of the L-type calcium channel gene CACNA1C by the direct sequencing of candidate genes. A concomitant gain-of-function variant in the sodium channel gene SCN5A (p.R1193Q) was found to rescue the phenotype of the female CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation carriers, which led to the incomplete penetrance. The functional studies, via the exogenous expression approach, revealed that the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation led to a decreasing L-type calcium current and the protein expression defect. The decreased calcium current produced by the mutant channel was improved by isoproterenol but exacerbated by testosterone. The effects of CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation and testosterone on cellular electrophysiology were further confirmed by the human ventricular action potential simulation.Our results demonstrated that the loss-of-function CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation contributed to ERS-related sudden cardiac death, and the phenotypic incomplete penetrance was modified by the SCN5A-R1193Q variant and sex. These findings suggest that phenotypes of ERS are modified by multiple genetic factors, which supports the theory that ERS may be an oligogenic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2611975862,"Species within the marine toxic dinoflagellate genus Dinophysis are phagotrophic organisms that exploit chloroplasts (kleptochloroplasts) from other protists to perform photosynthesis. Dinophysis spp. acquire the kleptochloroplasts from the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum, which in turn acquires the chloroplasts from a unique clade of cryptophytes. Dinophysis spp. digest the prey nuclei and all other cell organelles upon ingestion (except the kleptochloroplasts) and they are therefore believed to constantly acquire new chloroplasts as the populations grow. Previous studies have, however, indicated that Dinophysis can keep the kleptochloroplasts active during long term starvation and are able to produce photosynthetic pigments when exposed to prey starvation. This indicates a considerable control over the kleptochloroplasts and the ability of Dinophysis to replicate its kleptochloroplasts was therefore re-investigated in detail in this study. The kleptochloroplasts of Dinophysis acuta and Dinophysis acuminata were analyzed using confocal microscopy and 3D bioimaging software during long term starvation experiments. The cell concentrations were monitored to confirm cell divisions and samples were withdrawn each time a doubling had occurred. The results show direct evidence of kleptochloroplastidic division and that the decreases in total kleptochloroplast volume, number of kleptochloroplasts and number of kleptochloroplast centers were not caused by dilution due to cell divisions. This is the first report of division of kleptochloroplasts in any protist without the associated prey nuclei. This indicates that Dinophysis spp. may be in a transitional phase towards possessing permanent chloroplasts, which thereby potentially makes it a key organism to understand the evolution of phototrophic protists."
https://openalex.org/W2613761944,"We previously observed that dopamine D2-like receptor blockade in rats licking for sucrose produced a within-session decrement of the emission of licking bursts similar to the effect of either reward devaluation, or neuroleptics, on operant responding for different rewards, which, accordingly, we interpreted as an extinction-like effect. This implies that exposing animals to reward devaluation would result in a drop of burst number taking place only after the contact with the devalued reward. To test this prediction, we compared the difference in the within-session time course of burst number in response to high (10%) versus low (2%) concentration sucrose solutions, either in a condition of reward devaluation (exposure to 2% after daily 10%), or in a condition which does not involve changes in the reward value (two groups of subjects each repeatedly exposed to only one of the two concentrations). Reward devaluation resulted in a within-session decrement of the burst number, with the response rate dropping only after the contact with the devalued reward, as predicted. This response pattern was reliably observed only in subjects at their first devaluation experience. In contrast, exposure of separate groups of animals to the two different concentrations yielded lower levels of burst number in the low concentration group apparent since the beginning of the session, as previously observed with dopamine D1-like receptor blockade. These results show that the analysis of burst number, but not of burst size, reveals a specific activation pattern in response to reward devaluation, which differs from the pattern observed comparing the response to two different sucrose concentrations in separate groups of subjects, i.e. in a condition not involving reward devaluation. Finally, the characterisation of the experimental measures of the analysis of licking microstructure in behaviourally (and psychologically) meaningful functional terms, might be relevant for the investigation of the mechanisms underlying behavioural activation and the related evaluation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2612620791,"The proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) provides an essential uptake route for the vitamin folic acid (B9) in mammals. In addition, it is currently of high interest for targeting chemotherapeutic agents to tumors due to the increased folic acid requirement of rapidly dividing tumor cells as well as the upregulated PCFT expression in several tumors. To understand its function, determination of its atomic structure and molecular mechanism of transport are essential goals that require large amounts of functional PCFT. Here, we present a high-level heterologous expression system for human PCFT using a recombinant baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. We demonstrate folate transport functionality along the PCFT expression, isolation, and purification process. Importantly, purified PCFT transports folic acid after reconstitution. We thus succeeded in overcoming heterologous expression as a major bottleneck of PCFT research. The availability of an overexpression system for human PCFT provides the basis for future biochemical, biophysical and structural studies."
https://openalex.org/W2612645012,"We simulate the onset and evolution of the earliest splashing of an infinite cylindrical liquid drop on a smooth dry solid surface. A tiny splash is observed to be emitted out of the rim of the lamella in the early stage of the impact. We find that the onset time of the splash is primarily dependent on the characteristic timescale, which is defined by the impact velocity as well as the drop radius, with no strong dependence on either the liquid viscosity or surface tension. Three regimes are found to be responsible for different splashing patterns. The outermost ejected droplets keep extending radially at a uniform speed proportional to the impact speed. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanism which is responsible for the occurrence of the initial drop splash in the study."
https://openalex.org/W2613211803,"Background Gender bias in medical journals can affect the science and the benefit to patients. It has never been investigated in clinical case reports. The oversight is important because of the role clinical case reports play in hypothesis generation and medical education. We investigated contemporary gender bias in case reports for the highest ranked journals in general and internal medicine. Methods PubMed case reports data from 2011 to 2016 were extracted for the Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, the Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine. The gender of the patients were identified and a text analysis of the Medical Subject Headings conducted. Results A total of 2,742 case reports were downloaded and 2,582 (95.6%) reports contributed to the final analysis. A pooled analysis showed a statistically significant gender bias against female case reports (0.45; 95%CI: 0.43–0.47). The Annals of Internal Medicine was the only journal with a point estimate (non significant) in the direction of a bias against male patients. The text analysis identified no substantive difference in the focus of the case reports and no obvious explanation for the bias. Conclusion Gender bias, previously identified in clinical research and in clinical authorship, extends into the patients presented in clinical case reports. Whether it is driven by authors or editors is not clear, but it likely contributes to and supports an overall male bias of clinical medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2614090437,"The study was conducted to optimize lighting schedule for pre-pubertal (12 to 22 weeks) Chinese native breed Pengxian yellow pullet. A total of 414 healthy pullets (10 weeks), with similar body weight were randomly distributed into three groups (n = 138) and housed in individual cages for up to 12 weeks of age in light controlled rooms and provided normal lighting schedule (10L:14D). At 12 to 18 weeks of age, pullets were housed in three rooms, having varying lighting schedule viz. G1 (8L: 16D), G2 (10L:14D), or G3 (12L:12D). From 19th week onwards lighting schedule was gradually increased every week in incremental manner till all groups started receiving 16L:8D lighting schedule. The age at first egg, weight of first egg laid, percent peak hen day egg production, concentration of plasma luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones and expression of genes regulating synthesis or/and secretion of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone-I (GnRH-I), and pituitary LH-β and FSH-β were studied during experimental period (12 to 43 weeks of age) of this study. The result indicated that pullets of long day length (G3) group had higher plasma levels of FSH and LH and also better mRNA expression that regulates synthesis or/and secretion of GnRH-I, FSH-β, and LH-β before egg laying. The age at first egg (151.3 days) in pullets of G3 group receiving longer lighting hours (12L:12D) was 8.8 days less (P<0.05) compared to pullets of G1 group, while it was 6.9 days less (P>0.05) compared to G2. However, significantly higher (P<0.05) plasma levels of LH and FSH in pullets of G1 as compared to pullets belonging to G3 group corresponded with the higher (P<0.05) cumulative egg production during the experimental period, while these attributes in G2 group didn't differ from either G1 or G3 groups. Pullets of G1 group had significantly higher levels (P<0.05) of GnRH-I, FSH-β, and LH-β mRNA abundances at 43 weeks of age than other two groups and this corresponded with the percent (hen day) peak egg production (75.38%) in pullets in this G1 group that was attained at 32 weeks of age, while the peak production of 71.24% was attained at 30 weeks of age in G3 group. There was no effect of lighting schedule on body weight of pullets, recorded during experimental period, at all occasions; belonging to three groups (G1,G2 and G3) and receiving varying hours of photo-stimulation (P>0.05). It was inferred that the optimum lighting schedule for Chinese native breed Pengxian yellow pullets during 10 weeks of pre-pubertal growth period is short hours of photo-stimulation (i.e 8L:16D)."
https://openalex.org/W2612990438,"TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase1 (TBK1) is a serine-threonine kinase at the crossroads of multiple interferon (IFN)-inducing signaling pathways in innate immunity. The importance of TBK1 in antiviral immunity is well established in mammal models, but in chicken, the molecular characterization and potential function of TBK1 remain unclear. In the present study, the open-reading frame (ORF) of chicken TBK1 (chTBK1) was cloned and characterized. The sequencing results revealed that the chTBK1 ORF consists of 2190 base pairs (bp) encoding a deduced protein of 729 amino acid residues. Multiple sequence alignment analysis demonstrated chTBK1 similarity to other birds and mammals, which indicates that it is evolutionarily conserved. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that chTBK1 was ubiquitously expressed in chicken tissues and expression was especially high in immune tissues. In addition, the expression of chTBK1 was significantly up-regulated by infection with avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) both in vivo and in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) challenged with ALV-J or stimulated with poly I:C in vitro. Consistent with the activation of chTBK1, the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IFNβ gene in CEFs were also up-regulated after challenge with ALV-J or polyI:C. In contrast, the expression of IRF3 and IFNβ in CEFs was significantly reduced by siRNA targeting the chTBK1 gene compared with a negative control (NC) during ALV-J infection or polyI:C transfection. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that chTBK1 may be an important immunoregulator for IRF3 and IFNβ induction in response to viral stimulation in chicken."
https://openalex.org/W2613093384,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in many biological processes and are considered as an emerging class of pharmacology drugs for diagnosis and therapy. However to fully exploit the therapeutic potential of miRNAs, it is becoming crucial to monitor their expression pattern using medical imaging modalities. Recently, we developed a method called RILES, for RNAi-Inducible Luciferase Expression System that relies on an engineered regulatable expression system to switch-ON the expression of the luciferase gene when a miRNA of interest is expressed in cells. Here we investigated whether replacing the luciferase reporter gene with the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) reporter gene will be also suited to monitor the expression of miRNAs in a clinical setting context. We provide evidence that radionuclide imaging of miRNA expression using hNIS is feasible although it is not as robust as when the luciferase reporter gene is used. However, under appropriate conditions, we monitored the expression of several miRNAs in cells, in the liver and in the tibialis anterior muscle of mice undergoing muscular atrophy. We demonstrated that radiotracer accumulation in transfected cells correlated with the induction of hNIS and with the expression of miRNAs detected by real time PCR. We established the kinetic of miRNA-23a expression in mice and demonstrated that this miRNA follows a biphasic expression pattern characterized by a loss of expression at a late time point of muscular atrophy. At autopsy, we found an opposite expression pattern between miRNA-23a and one of the main transcriptional target of this miRNA, APAF-1, and as downstream target, Caspase 9. Our results report the first positive monitoring of endogenously expressed miRNAs in a nuclear medicine imaging context and support the development of additional work to establish the potential therapeutic value of miRNA-23 to prevent the damaging effects of muscular atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2614070998,"Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is the most common pathogen of pyogenic liver abscess in East and Southeast Asia and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor. The effect and mechanism of diabetes on KP liver abscess was examined in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and Akita mice (C57BL/6J-Ins2Akita). KP translocation to liver and plasma alaine transaminase levels were increased and liver clearance of KP was decreased in DM mice. Diabetic mice exhibited overgrowth of Enterococcus as well as E.coli and decreased lactobacilli/bifidas growth in intestine, increased intestinal iNOS protein and nitrite levels in portal vein, and increased IL-1β and TNF-α expression of Kupffer cells. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) or dead L. salivarius (dLac) supplementation reversed diabetes-induced enteric dysbiosis, NO levels in portal vein, and KP translocation to liver. L-NAME treatment decreased intestinal iNOS protein expression as well as Kupffer cell activation and increased liver clearance of KP in DM mice. Dead E.coli (2×108 CFU/ml) feeding for one week induced iNOS and TLR4 expression of intestine in germ-free (GF) mice. Dead bacteria feeding induced IL-1β and TNF-α expression of Kupffer cells in GF mice but not in GF TLR4-/- mice. In conclusion, balance of intestinal microflora is important for preventing intestinal iNOS expression, Kupffer cell activation, and KP liver translocation in diabetes. Reversal of diabetes-induced enteric dysbiosis with FOS or dead L. salivarius decreases diabetes-induced intestinal iNOS expression and KP liver translocation. Diabetes induces Kupffer cell activation and KP liver translocation through enteric dysbiosis and nitric oxide production."
https://openalex.org/W2612254199,"Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] genetic diversity is limited because domesticated soybean has undergone multiple genetic bottlenecks. Its progenitor, the wild soybean [Glycine soja Siebold & Zucc], has not undergone the same intense selection and is much more genetically diverse than domesticated soybean. However, the agronomic importance of diversity in wild soybean is unclear, and its weedy nature makes assessment difficult. To address this issue, we chose for study a highly selected, adapted F4-derived progeny of wild soybean, NMS4-44-329. This breeding line is derived from the hybridization between G. max cultivar N7103 and G. soja PI 366122. Agronomic comparisons were made among N7103, NMS4-44-329 and their F1 and F2 progeny in replicated yield trials at two North Carolina locations. Significant F1 mid-parent heterosis was observed at each location for seed yield (189 and 223 kgha-1, P<0.05 and P<0.10, respectively), seed protein content (1.1g/100g, P<0.01) and protein production per hectare (101 and 100 kgha-1, P<0.01 and P<0.06, respectively). Increased yield, seed protein content and protein production per hectare in the hybrids suggested that wild soybean has the potential to improve agronomic traits in applied breeding. Comparisons of differentially-expressed genes in the hybrid vs. parents identified genes associated with N metabolism. Non-additive changes in gene expression in the hybrids relative to the parents could reasonably explain the improved protein levels in the F1 hybrids. Changes in gene expression were influenced by environmental effects; however, allele specific bias in the hybrids were well correlated between environments. We propose that changes in gene expression, both additive and non-additive, and changes in allele specific expression bias may explain agronomic traits, and be valuable tools for plant breeders in the assessment of breeding populations."
https://openalex.org/W2613490006,"Background The Na-H exchanger [NHE] performs an electroneutral uptake of NaCl and water from the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. There are several distinct NHE isoforms, some of which show an altered expression in the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this study, we examined a role of NHE-2 in experimental colitis. Methods Colitis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by intra-rectal administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). On day 6 post-TNBS, the animals were sacrificed, colonic and ileal segments were taken out, cleaned with phosphate buffered saline and used in this study. Results There was a significant decrease in the level of NHE-2 protein as measured by ECL western blot analysis and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The levels of NHE-2 mRNA and heteronuclear RNA measured by an end-point RT-PCR and a real time PCR were also decreased significantly in the inflamed colon. However, there was no change in the level of NHE-2 protein in response to in vitro TNF-α treatment of uninflamed rat colonic segment. These changes were selective and localized to the colon as actin, an internal control, remained unchanged. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed co-localization of NHE-2 and NHE-3 in the brush borders of colonic epithelial cells. Inflamed colon showed a significant increase in myeloperoxidase activity and colon hypertrophy. In addition, there was a significant decrease in body weight and goblet cells’ mucin staining in the TNBS treated colon. These changes were not conspicuous in the non-inflamed ileum. Conclusions These findings demonstrate suppression of NHE-2 expression on the brush borders in the colonic epithelial cells which is regulated transcriptionally. However a role of TNF-α in the regulation of NHE-2 is discounted in the present model of colitis. This decrease in the NHE-2 expression will lead to a loss of electrolyte and water uptake thus contributing to the symptoms associated with IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2612184490,"In structural biology, Small-Angle Scattering experiments (SAS) are unique, because although they provide low resolution data, they can be performed in closer-to-native conditions than those arising in X-Ray crystallography. A number of questions on SAS, however, remain unsolved, particularly in the light of modelling ensembles of conformers in solution. In this article, we study the ensemble average and covariance of SAS profiles analytically. Using this ensemble covariance, we demonstrate the hierarchical nature of SAS profiles. Furthermore, we show that the information content is not uniform and reaches its maximum in the intermediate q range. The arguments are generalized using microsecond-scale molecular dynamics trajectories of the lysozyme and on an ensemble of the intrinsically disordered protein p15PAF. We show that for highly flexible systems, the SAS profile is a representation of the ensemble of conformers in solution, and not that of one conformer in particular."
https://openalex.org/W2612695631,"Background Many asthmatic patients exhibit uncontrolled asthma despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Airway epithelial cells (AEC) have distinct activation profiles that can influence ICS response. Objectives A pilot study to identify gene expression markers of AEC dysfunction and markers of corticosteroid sensitivity in asthmatic and non-asthmatic control children, for comparison with published reports in adults. Methods AEC were obtained by nasal brushings and primary submerged cultures, and incubated in control conditions or in the presence of 10 ng/ml TNFalpha, 10-8M dexamethasone, or both. RT-PCR-based expression of FKBP51 (a steroid hormone receptor signalling regulator), NF-kB, IL-6, LIF (an IL-6 family neurotrophic cytokine), serpinB2 (which inhibits plasminogen activation and promotes fibrin deposition) and porin (a marker of mitochondrial mass) were determined. Results 6 patients without asthma (median age 11yr; min-max: 7–13), 8 with controlled asthma (11yr, 7–13; median daily fluticasone dose = 100 μg), and 4 with uncontrolled asthma (12yr, 7–14; 1000 μg fluticasone daily) were included. Baseline expression of LIF mRNA was significantly increased in uncontrolled vs controlled asthmatic children. TNFalpha significantly increased LIF expression in uncontrolled asthma. A similar trend was observed regarding IL-6. Dexamethasone significantly upregulated FKBP51 expression in all groups but the response was blunted in asthmatic children. No significant upregulation was identified regarding NF-kB, serpinB2 and porin. Conclusion LIF and FKBP51 expression in epithelial cells were the most interesting markers of AEC dysfunction/response to corticosteroid treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2612654269,"Our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified three independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region showing association with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, we increased GWAS sample size on MHC region and performed validation in an independent ESCC cases and normal controls with aim to find additional loci at MHC region showing association with an increased risk to ESCC.The 1,077 ESCC cases and 1,733 controls were genotyped using Illumina Human 610-Quad Bead Chip, and 451 cases and 374 controls were genotyped using Illumina Human 660W-Quad Bead Chip. After quality control, the selected SNPs were replicated by TaqMan genotyping assay on another 2,026 ESCC cases and 2,384 normal controls.By excluding low quality SNPs in primary GWAS screening, we selected 2,533 SNPs in MHC region for association analysis, and identified 5 SNPs with p <10-4. Further validation analysis in an independent case-control cohort confirmed one of the 5 SNPs (rs911178) that showed significant association with ESCC. rs911178 (PGWAS = 6.125E-04, OR = 0.644 and Preplication = 1.406E-22, OR = 0.489) was located at upstream of SCAND3.The rs911178 (SCAND3 gene) in MHC region is significantly associated with high risk of ESCC. This study not only reveal the potential role of MHC region for the pathogenesis of ESCC, but also provides important clues for the establishment of tools and methods for screening high risk population of ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W2612650019,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2612235623,"Localization of the wireless sensor network is a vital area acquiring an impressive research concern and called upon to expand more with the rising of its applications. As localization is gaining prominence in wireless sensor network, it is vulnerable to jamming attacks. Jamming attacks disrupt communication opportunity among the sender and receiver and deeply impact the localization process, leading to a huge error of the estimated sensor node position. Therefore, detection and elimination of jamming influence are absolutely indispensable. Range-based techniques especially Received Signal Strength (RSS) is facing severe impact of these attacks. This paper proposes algorithms based on Combination Multiple Frequency Multiple Power Localization (C-MFMPL) and Step Function Multiple Frequency Multiple Power Localization (SF-MFMPL). The algorithms have been tested in the presence of multiple types of jamming attacks including capture and replay, random and constant jammers over a log normal shadow fading propagation model. In order to overcome the impact of random and constant jammers, the proposed method uses two sets of frequencies shared by the implemented anchor nodes to obtain the averaged RSS readings all over the transmitted frequencies successfully. In addition, three stages of filters have been used to cope with the replayed beacons caused by the capture and replay jammers. In this paper the localization performance of the proposed algorithms for the ideal case which is defined by without the existence of the jamming attack are compared with the case of jamming attacks. The main contribution of this paper is to achieve robust localization performance in the presence of multiple jamming attacks under log normal shadow fading environment with a different simulation conditions and scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2612951142,"This study investigated the potential of a newly proposed scattering foil free (SFF) electron beam scanning technique for the treatment of skin cancer on the irregular patient surfaces using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. After benchmarking of the MC simulations, we removed the scattering foil to generate SFF electron beams. Cylindrical and spherical phantoms with 1 cm boluses were generated and the target volume was defined from the surface to 5 mm depth. The SFF scanning technique with 6 MeV electrons was simulated using those phantoms. For comparison, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were also generated with two full arcs and 6 MV photon beams. When the scanning resolution resulted in a larger separation between beams than the field size, the plan qualities were worsened. In the cylindrical phantom with a radius of 10 cm, the conformity indices, homogeneity indices and body mean doses of the SFF plans (scanning resolution = 1°) vs. VMAT plans were 1.04 vs. 1.54, 1.10 vs. 1.12 and 5 Gy vs. 14 Gy, respectively. Those of the spherical phantom were 1.04 vs. 1.83, 1.08 vs. 1.09 and 7 Gy vs. 26 Gy, respectively. The proposed SFF plans showed superior dose distributions compared to the VMAT plans."
