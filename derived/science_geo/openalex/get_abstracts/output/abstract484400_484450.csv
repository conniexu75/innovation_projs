https://openalex.org/W2160995259,"Jay Shendure, Greg Cooper and colleagues report a framework for annotation of genetic variation, Combined Annotation–Dependent Depletion (CADD), integrating diverse annotations into a single C score. They show that C scores correlate with annotations of functionality, pathogenicity and experimentally measured regulatory effects. Current methods for annotating and interpreting human genetic variation tend to exploit a single information type (for example, conservation) and/or are restricted in scope (for example, to missense changes). Here we describe Combined Annotation–Dependent Depletion (CADD), a method for objectively integrating many diverse annotations into a single measure (C score) for each variant. We implement CADD as a support vector machine trained to differentiate 14.7 million high-frequency human-derived alleles from 14.7 million simulated variants. We precompute C scores for all 8.6 billion possible human single-nucleotide variants and enable scoring of short insertions-deletions. C scores correlate with allelic diversity, annotations of functionality, pathogenicity, disease severity, experimentally measured regulatory effects and complex trait associations, and they highly rank known pathogenic variants within individual genomes. The ability of CADD to prioritize functional, deleterious and pathogenic variants across many functional categories, effect sizes and genetic architectures is unmatched by any current single-annotation method."
https://openalex.org/W1968657935,"Charles Swanton and colleagues used multiregion exome sequencing to study the evolutionary histories of ten clear cell renal cell carcinomas. They observed marked intratumoral heterogeneity in all cases, with extensive evidence of parallel evolution of tumor subclones and only a small number of truncal driver events. Clear cell renal carcinomas (ccRCCs) can display intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). We applied multiregion exome sequencing (M-seq) to resolve the genetic architecture and evolutionary histories of ten ccRCCs. Ultra-deep sequencing identified ITH in all cases. We found that 73–75% of identified ccRCC driver aberrations were subclonal, confounding estimates of driver mutation prevalence. ITH increased with the number of biopsies analyzed, without evidence of saturation in most tumors. Chromosome 3p loss and VHL aberrations were the only ubiquitous events. The proportion of C>T transitions at CpG sites increased during tumor progression. M-seq permits the temporal resolution of ccRCC evolution and refines mutational signatures occurring during tumor development."

Monkeys have served as one of the most valuable models for modeling human diseases and developing therapeutic strategies due to their close similarities to humans in terms of genetic and physiological features (Chan, 2013Chan A.W. Progress and prospects for genetic modification of nonhuman primate models in biomedical research.ILAR J. 2013; 54: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The genetic modification is invaluable for generation of monkey models. Although several transgenic monkeys have been successfully generated using retroviral or lentiviral vectors (Chan et al., 2001Chan A.W. Chong K.Y. Martinovich C. Simerly C. Schatten G.

The recently described clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system confers targeted gene editing by small RNAs that guide the Cas9 nuclease to the target site through base pairing (Jinek et al., 2012Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.Science. 2012; 337: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (9324) Google Scholar). The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been demonstrated as an easy-handle, highly specific, efficient, and multiplexable approach for engineering eukaryotic genomes (Mali et al., 2013aMali P. Esvelt K.M. Church G.M. Cas9 as a versatile tool for engineering biology.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). By now, this system has been successfully used to target genomic loci in the mammalian cell lines (Cho et al., 2013Cho S.W. Kim S. Kim J.M. Kim J.S.

But whether it’s feasible in primates is still unclear. By taking the advantages of CRISPR/Cas9, we achieved efficient gene targeting in mice and rats by coinjection of one-cell-stage embryos with Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs (Li et al., 2013bLi W. Teng F. Li T.

Bai L. Huang X. Zhang L. Generating rats with conditional alleles using CRISPR/Cas9.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Encouraged by our successes in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting, as well as gene manipulation in early-cleavage-stage embryos of monkeys (Niu et al., 2010Niu Y. Yu Y. Bernat A. Yang S. He X. Guo X. Chen D. Chen Y. Ji S. Si W. et al.Transgenic rhesus monkeys produced by gene transfer into early-cleavage-stage embryos using a simian immunodeficiency virus-based vector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 17663-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), here, we have extended the application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to multiplex genetic engineering in one-cell-stage embryos of monkeys and successfully obtained founder animals harboring two gene modifications. We selected cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) as the model animal because of its body size, availability, similar menstrual cycle to human, and efficient reproduction ability (Sun et al., 2008Sun Q. Dong J. Yang W. Jin Y. Yang M. Wang Y. Wang P.L. Hu Y. Tsien J.Z. Efficient reproduction of cynomolgus monkey using pronuclear embryo transfer technique.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 12956-12960Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Three genes, namely Nr0b1 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 0 Group B Member 1), Ppar-γ (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma), and Rag1 (Recombination Activating Gene 1), were selected as the target genes. Two sgRNAs separated by 117 bp for Nr0b1, 2 sgRNAs separated by 49 bp for Ppar-γ, and 1 sgRNA targeting Rag1 (Figure 1A), were designed as described (Mali et al., 2013bMali P. Yang L. Esvelt K.M. Aach J. Guell M. DiCarlo J.E. Norville J.E. Church G.M. RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9.Science. 2013; 339: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (6424) Google Scholar). The efficiency of all sgRNAs was first tested by cotransfection with Cas9 into the COS-7 cell line derived from African green monkey kidney. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells harvested 72 hr after transient transfection and screened for the presence of site-specific gene modification by PCR amplification of regions surrounding the target sites as well as T7EN1 cleavage assay (Figure 1B). The cleavage bands were visible in all target genes. Further characterization of the cleavage by sequencing showed, different indels were detected at all five target sites with various mutation sizes (−336 ∼+1 bp) at the efficiency of 22.2% for Nr0b1-sgRNA1, 20% for Nr0b1-sgRNA2, 10% for Ppar-γ-sgRNA1, 25% for Ppar-γ-sgRNA2, and 23.8% for Rag1-sgRNA (Figure 1C). These data demonstrated that the selected sgRNAs worked effectively with Cas9 on monkey genomes. Although microinjection of ZFN or TALEN mRNA into embryo has been successfully used for creation of gene target animals, but they have not been feasible in monkeys so far (Chan, 2013Chan A.W. Progress and prospects for genetic modification of nonhuman primate models in biomedical research.ILAR J. 2013; 54: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To test whether the CRISPR/Cas9 system works in monkey embryos, the Cas9 (Addgene No. 44758) and sgRNAs were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro as described (Shen et al., 2013Shen B. Zhang J. Wu H. Wang J. Ma K. Li Z. Zhang X. Zhang P. Huang X. Generation of gene-modified mice via Cas9/RNA-mediated gene targeting.Cell Res. 2013; 23: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Twenty nanogram/μl Cas9 mRNA and 25 nanogram/μl of mixtures containing equal amount of each 5 sgRNAs were pooled and microinjected into 22 one-cell fertilized eggs of cynomolgus monkeys. The eggs were further cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2. A total of 15 embryos with normal development to morula or blastocyst stages were collected and examined for the presence of site-specific genome modification analysis by PCR, T7EN1 cleavage assay, and sequencing as described above. The results showed (Figures 2 and S1 available online), different sgRNAs function by different efficiency. Targeted modification with a range of sizes (−30 ∼+6 bp) in monkey embryos occurred at all three target genes with efficiency of 4/15 for Nr0b1, 7/15 for Ppar-γ, and 9/15 for Rag1. Intriguingly, 6 of 15 embryos (embryos 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 13) harbored simultaneously mutations in both Ppar-γ and Rag1; whereas 2 of 15 embryos (embryos 3 and 4) harbored simultaneously mutations in both Nr0b1 and Rag1, demonstrating that the CRISPR/Cas9 system functions well in monkey embryos.Figure S1sgRNA:Cas9-Mediated Modifications of Nr0b1, Ppar-γ and Rag1 in Cultured Embryos, Related to Figure 2Show full captionPCR products of the targeted region of Nr0b1, Ppar-γ, and Rag1 were amplified from cultured embryos.

After fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA mixtures of five sgRNAs were injected as described above. A total 83 out of 186 injected zygotes were transferred into 29 surrogate females. Of the recipient mothers, ten pregnancies were established (34.5%; 10 out of 29), one of which was miscarried 36 days after embryo transfer. Among the pregnancies, three were twins, three were triplets, and the remaining four were single pregnancies (Table 1). So far, a set of twin female babies (A and B) were successfully delivered at full term (155 days) by caesarean section (Figure 3A). The other eight surrogate females are still in the gestation period. The noninvasively available tissues of the two infant monkeys, including placenta, umbilical cord, and ear punch tissues, were collected. Cas9/RNA-mediated genome modifications were first screened using genomic DNA from umbilical cord as described above. An additional band with smaller molecular size was observed by PCR amplification of the target region of Rag1 in infant B (Figure 3B), suggesting that the genomic modification occurred in this founder animal. Next, all the PCR products were subjected to the T7EN1 cleavage assay (Figure 3C). Cleavage products were detected in both infants in Rag1 and around the second sgRNA target site of Ppar-γ, indicating the presence of multiple genomic modifications in the founder monkeys. As expected, different kinds of indels (one for Ppar-γ, four for Rag1) were detected by sequencing of the PCR products (Figure 3D), further confirming the occurrence of multiple genomic modifications in the founder monkeys. Of note, no cleavage band was detected at Nr0b1 (Figure S2), which may be due to the lowest mutation efficiency of this gene in the embryonic test described above.Table 1Summary of Embryo Microinjection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAsMII OocyteInjected EmbryosEmbryos for ETPregnancies /SurrogatesSingle PregnancyMultiple PregnancyFetuses1981868334.5% (10/29)4aOne miscarried 36 days after embryo transfer.3 twins, 3 triplets19a One miscarried 36 days after embryo transfer.

The same PCR bands, cleavage bands, and modifications were detected in Rag1 and Ppar-γ genes in both monkeys (Figure 4), further demonstrating the targeting success and confirming that CRISPR/Cas9 induces global genome modification in monkey embryos. Very impressively, no wild-type Rag1 sequence was detected in the ear punch of founder B (Figure 4C), demonstrating that the target modification has been ubiquitously and efficiently integrated into different tissues, most likely including the germline. We also further substantiated the allelic targeting effects by tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of parent monkeys. A 3.8 kb fragment harboring Rag1-sgRNA target site was PCR amplified from ear genomic DNA of the parents and sequenced. Two different combinations of 4 SNPs tagging the parents derivation were detected downstream of the target site of Rag1-sgRNA (Figure S3A, Tables S1 and S5). The tagging SNP combinations of the parents and the founder twins were further determined by TA cloning and sequencing (Figures S3B and S3C). The results showed that two tagging SNP combinations segregate in accordance with Mendel’s laws. The Rag1-sgRNA target site in the ear of founder B showed high target efficiency was further sequenced. The results (Figure S3D) showed that both alleles identified by tagging SNPs harbored target modifications, indicating two alleles from both parents could be modified by Cas9/RNA-mediated targeting in monkeys. Surprisingly, only one genotype with a single-nucleotide insertion for Ppar-γ at different tissues of both founder animals was detected (Figures 3D and 4C). To exclude the possibility that this single-nucleotide insertion was a SNP rather than a real mutation, the target sites of the parents and surrogate mother were amplified to perform T7EN1 cleavage assay and sequencing (Figure S4). The results excluded the presence of the same single nucleotide, confirming that the insertion was indeed caused by CRISPR/Cas9 modification to the Ppar-γ gene. Taken together, we have successfully achieved Cas9/RNA-mediated site-specific modifications in monkey genome by one-cell embryo microinjection. It is worth notifying that the sequence data of both cultured embryos and founder animals showed multiple genotypes (Figures 2B, 3D, and 4C), suggesting the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage had occurred multiple times at different stages of monkey embryogenesis and resulted in mosaicism of the modification, as have been observed in other species (Sung et al., 2013Sung Y.H. Baek I.J. Kim D.H. Jeon J. Lee J. Lee K. Jeong D. Kim J.S. Lee H.W. Knockout mice created by TALEN-mediated gene targeting.Nat.

Zhang L. et al.Knockout rats generated by embryo microinjection of TALENs.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Currently, the founder babies are housed in dedicated facilities and developing normally. Due to the limited access of tissues from the founder infants, more thorough characterization of the genomic modifications as well as phenotype remains to be performed. This has to be awaited until the founder monkeys have developed into adulthood. In addition, more full-term founders will be born and provide more samples for further assessment of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome modification in monkeys. The off-target effect is of a major concern for the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fu et al., 2013Fu Y. Foden J.A. Khayter C. Maeder M.L. Reyon D. Joung J.K. Sander J.D.

High-throughput profiling of off-target DNA cleavage reveals RNA-programmed Cas9 nuclease specificity.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). We observed CRISPR/Cas9 induced heritable off-target mutation in mice (B.S., W. Zhang, J. Zhang, J. Zhou, J.W., L. Chen, L. Wang, A. Hodgkins, V. Iyer, X.H., and W.C. Skarnes, unpublished data). To test whether off target occurred in these genetic modified monkeys, we screened the monkey genome and predicted a total of 84 potential off-target sites (OTS), including 9 for site 1 of Nr0b1, 20 for site 2 of Nr0b1, 14 for site 1 of Ppar-γ, 20 for site 2 of Ppar-γ, and 21 for Rag1, respectively (Table S2). The off-target effects were comprehensively assessed as on-target effect analysis using genomic DNA from umbilical cord. The fragments around all the potential off-target loci were PCR amplified, then subjected to T7EN1 cleavage assay. Seventeen PCR products yielded cleavage bands were precisely examined by TA sequencing. Surprisingly, all the cleavage were caused by SNP or repeat sequences, and no authentic mutation was detected (Table S3). These results demonstrated that Cas9/RNA does not induce detectable off-target mutation in our study. Considering that the off-target effect is site-dependent, and more specific strategies using mutated Cas9 have already been established (Ran et al., 2013Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Lin C.Y. Gootenberg J.S. Konermann S. Trevino A.E. Scott D.A. Inoue A. Matoba S. Zhang Y. Zhang F. Double nicking by RNA-guided CRISPR Cas9 for enhanced genome editing specificity.Cell. 2013; 154: 1380-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar), the off-target mutagenesis can be minimized by optimizing the procedure, suggesting CRISPR/Cas9 could be a reliable genome target tool for monkeys. In summary, our current studies demonstrate that site-specific gene modification can be effectively achieved in monkeys by coinjection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs into the one-cell fertilized eggs. We also demonstrate that the multiple genetic mutations can be established at once without detectable off-target effects, providing the success of creating genome engineered primates and confirming the CRISPR/Cas9 system is applicable for monkey genome targeting. Healthy female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), ranging in age from 5 to 8 years and having body weights of 3.62 to 5.90 kg, were selected for use in this study. All animals were housed at the Kunming Biomed International (KBI). The KBI is an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care accredited facility. All animal protocols are approved in advance by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kunming Biomed International. Embryo collection and transfer were performed as previously described (Niu et al., 2010Niu Y. Yu Y. Bernat A. Yang S. He X. Guo X. Chen D. Chen Y. Ji S. Si W. et al.Transgenic rhesus monkeys produced by gene transfer into early-cleavage-stage embryos using a simian immunodeficiency virus-based vector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 17663-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, 11 healthy female cynomolgus monkeys aged 5–8 years with regular menstrual cycles were selected as oocyte donors for superovulation, which were performed by intramuscular injection with rhFSH (recombinant human follitropin alfa, GONAL-F, Merck Serono) for 8 days, then rhCG (recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin alfa, OVIDREL, Merck Serono) on day 9. Oocytes were collected by laparoscopic follicular aspiration 32–35 hr after rhCG administration. MII (first polar body present) oocytes were used to perform intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and the fertilization was confirmed by the presence of two pronuclei. The zygotes were injected with a mixture of Cas9 mRNA (20 ng/μl) and five sgRNAs (5 ng/μl each). Microinjections were performed in the cytoplasm of zygotes using a Nikon microinjection system under standard conditions. The zygotes then were cultured in the chemically defined, protein-free hamster embryo culture medium-10 (HECM-10) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, SH30088.02) at 37°C in 5% CO2. The cleaved embryos with high quality at two-cell to blastocyst stage were transferred into the oviduct of the matched recipient monkeys. Twenty-nine monkeys were used as surrogate recipient, and typically, three embryos were transferred into each female. The earliest pregnancy diagnosis was performed by ultrasonography about 20–30 days after the embryo transfer. Both clinical pregnancy and number of fetuses were confirmed by fetal cardiac activity and presence of a yolk sac as detected by ultrasonography (Chen et al., 2012Chen Y. Niu Y. Yang S. He X. Ji S. Si W. Tang X. Xie Y. Wang H. Lu Y. et al.The available time window for embryo transfer in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta).Am. J. Primatol. 2012; 74: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Codon optimized Cas9 expression construct, Cas9-N-NLS-flag-linker (Addgene No. 44758), was synthesized and inserted into pST1374 vector as described before (Shen et al., 2013Shen B. Zhang J. Wu H. Wang J. Ma K. Li Z. Zhang X. Zhang P. Huang X. Generation of gene-modified mice via Cas9/RNA-mediated gene targeting.Cell Res. 2013; 23: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The pUC57-sgRNA expression vector used for in vitro transcription of sgRNAs was described as before (Zhou et al., 2014Zhou J. Shen B. Zhang W. Wang J. Yang J. Chen L. Zhang N. Zhu K. Xu J. Hu B. et al.One-step generation of different immunodeficient mice with multiple gene modifications by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome engineering.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2014; 46: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). pGL3-U6-sgRNA-PGK-Puro vector, containing the U6-PGK-Puro fragment amplified from pLKO.1 (Addgene No. 8453), sgRNA scaffold amplified from pUC57-sgRNA, and pGL3-Basic plasmid backbone (Promega, E1751) was used for expression of sgRNAs in cells. Oligos for the generation of sgRNA expression plasmids (Table S4) were annealed and cloned into the BsaI sites of pUC57-sgRNA or pGL3-U6-sgRNA-PGK-Puro. pGL3-U6-sgRNA-PGK-Puro was deposited in Addgene (Addgene NO. 51133). COS-7 cells (ATCC, CRL-1651) were cultured in DMEM/high glucose (HyClone) with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml); 2 × 106 cells were electroporated (BioRad Gene Pulser XL) with four micrograms of Cas9 expression plasmids and two micrograms of pGL3-U6-sgRNA-PGK-Puro. Empty pGL3-U6-sgRNA-PGK-Puro plasmid was used as control. Cells were collected 72 hr postelectroporation. In vitro transcription was performed as described (Zhou et al., 2014Zhou J. Shen B. Zhang W. Wang J. Yang J. Chen L. Zhang N. Zhu K. Xu J. Hu B. et al.One-step generation of different immunodeficient mice with multiple gene modifications by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome engineering.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2014; 46: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pST1374-Cas9-N-NLS-flag-linker vector was linearized by Age1 enzyme and in vitro transcribed using T7 Ultra Kit (Ambion, AM1345). Cas9-N-NLS-flag-linker mRNA was purified by RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74104). sgRNA oligos were annealed into pUC57-sgRNA expression vector with T7 promoter. Then expression vectors were linearized by Dra I and transcribed by MEGAshortscript Kit (Ambion, AM1354) in vitro. The sgRNAs were purified by MEGAclear Kit (Ambion, AM1908) and recovered by alcohol precipitation. Different samples, including cells, placenta, umbilical cord, and ear punch tissues, were collected and digested in lysis buffer (10 μM Tris-HCl, 0.4 M NaCl, 2 μM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml Proteinase K). The genomic DNA was extracted from lysate by phenol-chloroform recovered by alcohol precipitation. Genomic DNA from cultured embryos was amplified by REPL1-g Single Cell Kit (QIAGEN, 150343) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. T7EN1 cleavage assay was performed as described (Shen et al., 2013Shen B. Zhang J. Wu H. Wang J. Ma K. Li Z. Zhang X. Zhang P. Huang X. Generation of gene-modified mice via Cas9/RNA-mediated gene targeting.Cell Res. 2013; 23: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In brief, targeted fragments were amplified by PrimerSTAR HS DNA polymerase (Takara, DR010A) from extracted DNA, and purified with PCR cleanup kit (Axygen, AP-PCR-50). Purified PCR product was denatured and reannealed in NEBuffer 2 (NEB) using a thermocycler. Hybridized PCR products were digested with T7EN1 (NEB, M0302L) for 30 min and separated by 2.5% agarose gel. To detect T7EN cleavage products of Nr0b1 (localized on chromosome X) in cultured embryos, 50 ng of PCR fragment from wild-type control embryos was mixed with 150 ng of PCR fragments from embryos injected with Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs. PCR products with mutations detected by T7EN1 cleavage assay were sub-cloned into T vector (Takara, D103A). For each sample, colonies were picked up randomly and sequenced by M13-47 primer. Primers for amplifying Nr0b1, Pparg, and Rag1 targeted fragments are listed in Table S5. All potential off-target sites with homology to the 23 bp sequence (sgRNA+PAM) were retrieved by a base-by-base scan of the whole rhesus genome (BGI CR_1.0/rheMac3), allowing for ungapped alignments with up to four mismatches in the sgRNA target sequence. In the output of the scan, potential off-target sites with less than three mismatches in the seed sequence (1 to 7 base) were selected to PCR amplification using umbilical cord genomic DNA as templates. The PCR products were first subject to T7EN1 cleavage assay. The potential off-target sites yielding typical cleavage bands were considered as candidates, then the PCR products of the candidates were cloned and sequenced to confirm the off-target effects. The primers for amplifying the off-target sites are listed in Table S6. J.S., W.J., X.H., and Q.Z. initiated the project, designed the experiments, and wrote the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2099048062,"Songlin Chen and colleagues sequenced the whole genomes of a male (ZZ) and a female (ZW) Chinese half-smooth tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis. Their analysis provides insights into the structure and evolution of the sex chromosomes and adaptation to the benthic lifestyle of this flatfish. Genetic sex determination by W and Z chromosomes has developed independently in different groups of organisms. To better understand the evolution of sex chromosomes and the plasticity of sex-determination mechanisms, we sequenced the whole genomes of a male (ZZ) and a female (ZW) half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). In addition to insights into adaptation to a benthic lifestyle, we find that the sex chromosomes of these fish are derived from the same ancestral vertebrate protochromosome as the avian W and Z chromosomes. Notably, the same gene on the Z chromosome, dmrt1, which is the male-determining gene in birds, showed convergent evolution of features that are compatible with a similar function in tongue sole. Comparison of the relatively young tongue sole sex chromosomes with those of mammals and birds identified events that occurred during the early phase of sex-chromosome evolution. Pertinent to the current debate about heterogametic sex-chromosome decay, we find that massive gene loss occurred in the wake of sex-chromosome 'birth'."
https://openalex.org/W2110387210,"Neural circuits must perform computations and then selectively output the results to other circuits. Yet synapses do not change radically at millisecond timescales. A key question then is: how is communication between neural circuits controlled? In motor control, brain areas directly involved in driving movement are active well before movement begins. Muscle activity is some readout of neural activity, yet it remains largely unchanged during preparation. Here we find that during preparation, while the monkey holds still, changes in motor cortical activity cancel out at the level of these population readouts. Motor cortex can thereby prepare the movement without prematurely causing it. Further, we found evidence that this mechanism also operates in dorsal premotor cortex, largely accounting for how preparatory activity is attenuated in primary motor cortex. Selective use of 'output-null' vs. 'output-potent' patterns of activity may thus help control communication to the muscles and between these brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2162227712,"Hunger is a hard-wired motivational state essential for survival. Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) at the base of the hypothalamus are crucial to the control of hunger. They are activated by caloric deficiency and, when naturally or artificially stimulated, they potently induce intense hunger and subsequent food intake. Consistent with their obligatory role in regulating appetite, genetic ablation or chemogenetic inhibition of AgRP neurons decreases feeding. Excitatory input to AgRP neurons is important in caloric-deficiency-induced activation, and is notable for its remarkable degree of caloric-state-dependent synaptic plasticity. Despite the important role of excitatory input, its source(s) has been unknown. Here, through the use of Cre-recombinase-enabled, cell-specific neuron mapping techniques in mice, we have discovered strong excitatory drive that, unexpectedly, emanates from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, specifically from subsets of neurons expressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, also known as ADCYAP1). Chemogenetic stimulation of these afferent neurons in sated mice markedly activates AgRP neurons and induces intense feeding. Conversely, acute inhibition in mice with caloric-deficiency-induced hunger decreases feeding. Discovery of these afferent neurons capable of triggering hunger advances understanding of how this intense motivational state is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2061185864,"The recognition events that mediate adaptive cellular immunity and regulate antibody responses depend on intercellular contacts between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). T-cell signalling is initiated at these contacts when surface-expressed T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize peptide fragments (antigens) of pathogens bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHC) on APCs. This, along with engagement of adhesion receptors, leads to the formation of a specialized junction between T cells and APCs, known as the immunological synapse, which mediates efficient delivery of effector molecules and intercellular signals across the synaptic cleft. T-cell recognition of pMHC and the adhesion ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on supported planar bilayers recapitulates the domain organization of the immunological synapse, which is characterized by central accumulation of TCRs, adjacent to a secretory domain, both surrounded by an adhesive ring. Although accumulation of TCRs at the immunological synapse centre correlates with T-cell function, this domain is itself largely devoid of TCR signalling activity, and is characterized by an unexplained immobilization of TCR-pMHC complexes relative to the highly dynamic immunological synapse periphery. Here we show that centrally accumulated TCRs are located on the surface of extracellular microvesicles that bud at the immunological synapse centre. Tumour susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) sorts TCRs for inclusion in microvesicles, whereas vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4) mediates scission of microvesicles from the T-cell plasma membrane. The human immunodeficiency virus polyprotein Gag co-opts this process for budding of virus-like particles. B cells bearing cognate pMHC receive TCRs from T cells and initiate intracellular signals in response to isolated synaptic microvesicles. We conclude that the immunological synapse orchestrates TCR sorting and release in extracellular microvesicles. These microvesicles deliver transcellular signals across antigen-dependent synapses by engaging cognate pMHC on APCs."

https://openalex.org/W2112113923,"Auxin regulates numerous plant developmental processes by controlling gene expression via a family of functionally distinct DNA-binding auxin response factors (ARFs), yet the mechanistic basis for generating specificity in auxin response is unknown. Here, we address this question by solving high-resolution crystal structures of the pivotal Arabidopsis developmental regulator ARF5/MONOPTEROS (MP), its divergent paralog ARF1, and a complex of ARF1 and a generic auxin response DNA element (AuxRE). We show that ARF DNA-binding domains also homodimerize to generate cooperative DNA binding, which is critical for in vivo ARF5/MP function. Strikingly, DNA-contacting residues are conserved between ARFs, and we discover that monomers have the same intrinsic specificity. ARF1 and ARF5 homodimers, however, differ in spacing tolerated between binding sites. Our data identify the DNA-binding domain as an ARF dimerization domain, suggest that ARF dimers bind complex sites as molecular calipers with ARF-specific spacing preference, and provide an atomic-scale mechanistic model for specificity in auxin response."
https://openalex.org/W2125043585,"The precision of skilled forelimb movement has long been presumed to rely on rapid feedback corrections triggered by internally directed copies of outgoing motor commands, but the functional relevance of inferred internal copy circuits has remained unclear. One class of spinal interneurons implicated in the control of mammalian forelimb movement, cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs), has the potential to convey an internal copy of premotor signals through dual innervation of forelimb-innervating motor neurons and precerebellar neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus. Here we examine whether the PN internal copy pathway functions in the control of goal-directed reaching. In mice, PNs include a genetically accessible subpopulation of cervical V2a interneurons, and their targeted ablation perturbs reaching while leaving intact other elements of forelimb movement. Moreover, optogenetic activation of the PN internal copy branch recruits a rapid cerebellar feedback loop that modulates forelimb motor neuron activity and severely disrupts reaching kinematics. Our findings implicate V2a PNs as the focus of an internal copy pathway assigned to the rapid updating of motor output during reaching behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W2139183953,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and malignant primary brain tumors and are aggressively treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Despite this treatment, recurrence is inevitable and survival has improved minimally over the last 50 years. Recent studies have suggested that GBMs exhibit both heterogeneity and instability of differentiation states and varying sensitivities of these states to radiation. Here, we employed an iterative combined theoretical and experimental strategy that takes into account tumor cellular heterogeneity and dynamically acquired radioresistance to predict the effectiveness of different radiation schedules. Using this model, we identified two delivery schedules predicted to significantly improve efficacy by taking advantage of the dynamic instability of radioresistance. These schedules led to superior survival in mice. Our interdisciplinary approach may also be applicable to other human cancer types treated with radiotherapy and, hence, may lay the foundation for significantly increasing the effectiveness of a mainstay of oncologic therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2071358231,"The extended amygdala has dominated research on the neural circuitry of fear and anxiety, but the septohippocampal axis also plays an important role. The lateral septum (LS) is thought to suppress fear and anxiety through its outputs to the hypothalamus. However, this structure has not yet been dissected using modern tools. The type 2 CRF receptor (Crfr2) marks a subset of LS neurons whose functional connectivity we have investigated using optogenetics. Crfr2(+) cells include GABAergic projection neurons that connect with the anterior hypothalamus. Surprisingly, we find that these LS outputs enhance stress-induced behavioral measures of anxiety. Furthermore, transient activation of Crfr2(+) neurons promotes, while inhibition suppresses, persistent anxious behaviors. LS Crfr2(+) outputs also positively regulate circulating corticosteroid levels. These data identify a subset of LS projection neurons that promote, rather than suppress, stress-induced behavioral and endocrinological dimensions of persistent anxiety states and provide a cellular point of entry to LS circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2047802226,"Autophagy is a catabolic pathway that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation. A key step in the pathway is the covalent conjugation of the ubiquitin-related protein Atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine (Atg8-PE) in autophagic membranes by a complex consisting of Atg16 and the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. Atg8 controls the expansion of autophagic precursor membranes, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we reconstitute Atg8 conjugation on giant unilamellar vesicles and supported lipid bilayers. We found that Atg8-PE associates with Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 into a membrane scaffold. By contrast, scaffold formation is counteracted by the mitochondrial cargo adaptor Atg32 through competition with Atg12-Atg5 for Atg8 binding. Atg4, previously known to recycle Atg8 from membranes, disassembles the scaffold. Importantly, mutants of Atg12 and Atg16 deficient in scaffold formation in vitro impair autophagy in vivo. This suggests that autophagic scaffolds are critical for phagophore biogenesis and thus autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2118680196,"The phagocytes of the innate immune system, macrophages and neutrophils, contribute to antibacterial defense, but their functional specialization and cooperation is unclear. Here, we report that three distinct phagocyte subsets play highly coordinated roles in bacterial urinary tract infection. Ly6C− macrophages acted as tissue-resident sentinels that attracted circulating neutrophils and Ly6C+ macrophages. Such Ly6C+ macrophages played a previously undescribed helper role: once recruited to the site of infection, they produced the cytokine TNF, which caused Ly6C− macrophages to secrete CXCL2. This chemokine activated matrix metalloproteinase-9 in neutrophils, allowing their entry into the uroepithelium to combat the bacteria. In summary, the sentinel macrophages elicit the powerful antibacterial functions of neutrophils only after confirmation by the helper macrophages, reminiscent of the licensing role of helper T cells in antiviral adaptive immunity. These findings identify helper macrophages and TNF as critical regulators in innate immunity against bacterial infections in epithelia."

Although most cell types can be reprogrammed, this dramatic cell fate conversion occurs only at low frequency following long latency, even when all cells are engineered to express the reprogramming factors (Carey et al., 2010Carey B.W.

The prevailing theory for this low efficiency and long latency is a stochastic model, which calls upon stochastic changes to help subvert the various barriers limiting the fate transitions (reviewed in Hanna et al., 2010Hanna J.H.

Mathematic modeling suggests the existence of a single major bottleneck event, although additional non-rate-limiting events may also exist (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Saha K. Pando B. van Zon J.

Elite and stochastic models for induced pluripotent stem cell generation.Nature. 2009; 460: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, the nature of such a bottleneck event has not been clearly defined. Although the reprogramming behavior of many cell types follows a stochastic model, it is possible that rare and/or transient somatic cells may exist in a post-bottleneck state and can progress toward reprogramming in a nonstochastic manner. We term such putative post-bottleneck somatic cells the privileged cells for reprogramming. Owing to the absence of the rate-limiting stochastic events, these somatic cells should display certain unique reprogramming behaviors (Figure 1): a privileged somatic cell should produce progeny that mainly progress toward pluripotency rather than adopt alternative cell fates; their progeny should transition into pluripotency rapidly in a largely synchronous fashion. Figure 1 depicts the key differences between privileged and stochastic reprogramming. Identification of a post-bottleneck cell state would help to define the nature of the stochastic events restricting Yamanaka reprogramming. In this study, we provide evidence for the existence of privileged somatic cells and describe a key feature of the privileged cell state as an unusually fast cell cycle. The fast cycling cells could exist naturally or could be induced from fibroblasts by Yamanaka factors and are responsible for essentially all reprogramming activities. Our data suggest a modified view for the role of cell-cycle regulation in reprogramming and refine the conventional stochastic versus elite models of reprogramming. To identify the existence of privileged somatic cells, we first took a live-cell imaging approach, with which the behaviors of single cells can be faithfully tracked with high resolution (Megyola et al., 2013Megyola C.M. Gao Y. Teixeira A.M. Cheng J. Heydari K. Cheng E.C. Nottoli T. Krause D.S. Lu J. Guo S. Dynamic migration and cell-cell interactions of early reprogramming revealed by high-resolution time-lapse imaging.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We focused on the well-defined granulocyte monocyte progenitors (GMP) because they support rapid and efficient reprogramming (Eminli et al., 2009Eminli S. Foudi A. Stadtfeld M. Maherali N. Ahfeldt T. Mostoslavsky G. Hock H. Hochedlinger K. Differentiation stage determines potential of hematopoietic cells for reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, Megyola et al., 2013Megyola C.M. Gao Y. Teixeira A.M. Cheng J. Heydari K. Cheng E.C. Nottoli T. Krause D.S. Lu J. Guo S. Dynamic migration and cell-cell interactions of early reprogramming revealed by high-resolution time-lapse imaging.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and are more likely to contain privileged cells. Specifically, GMPs from mice that carry both Rosa26:rtTA and Oct4:GFP alleles were used as source cells for reprogramming (FACS-sorting scheme in Figure S1B available online) so that activation of endogenous Oct4 locus can be detected as green fluorescence in live cells. The Yamanaka factors were introduced by a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible polycistronic lentivirus (Carey et al., 2009Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Hanna J. Saha K. Gao Q. Mitalipova M. Jaenisch R. Reprogramming of murine and human somatic cells using a single polycistronic vector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) so that factor expression could be initiated by adding Dox, with image acquisition starting about 1 hr later (the time required to calibrate the imaging system). The reprogramming cultures were imaged at 5–15 min intervals for ∼5 days, when Oct4:GFP+ cells display typical features of mouse pluripotent cells. These Oct4:GFP+ cells, though still Dox dependent, progress with reprogramming highly efficiently (Table S1) without any obvious bottleneck restrictions, reaching a pluripotent state that can support chimeric mice formation and germline transmission (Megyola et al., 2013Megyola C.M. Gao Y. Teixeira A.M. Cheng J. Heydari K. Cheng E.C. Nottoli T. Krause D.S. Lu J. Guo S. Dynamic migration and cell-cell interactions of early reprogramming revealed by high-resolution time-lapse imaging.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using this imaging approach, we mapped the entire fate transition process from single founder GMPs to Oct4:GFP+ progeny (Movie S1 and Figures S1A and 2A ) and constructed 14 successfully reprogrammed cell lineages from 5 independent experiments. Strikingly, these reprogrammed GMP lineages displayed a behavior that is consistent with features of the privileged state (Figure 1). All live progeny from these GMPs turned on Oct4:GFP, yielding multiple sister colonies with homogeneous Oct4:GFP fluorescence (Movie S1). No progeny retained hematopoietic appearance or became “stuck” in intermediate steps, which is prevalent in the stochastic reprogramming systems (Chen et al., 2013Chen J. Liu H. Liu J. Qi J. Wei B. Yang J. Liang H. Chen Y. Chen J. Wu Y. et al.H3K9 methylation is a barrier during somatic cell reprogramming into iPSCs.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang X. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Dissecting direct reprogramming through integrative genomic analysis.Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Because we added Dox within 1 hr of imaging and because it would take time before factor expression amounted to significant levels, we could ascertain with good confidence that the initial somatic cell state was captured in the imaging process. Taken together, live-cell imaging at single-cell resolution supports that some GMPs exist in a privileged state (Figures 2A and S1A and Movie S1). To further validate that a subset of GMPs is privileged, factor-transduced GMPs were FACS sorted as single cells into 96-well plates to achieve clonal reprogramming (experimental scheme in Figure S5A). When 420 total wells were examined after 5 days of Dox induction, 71 wells (17%) gave rise to Oct4:GFP+ colonies. The majority of wells (97%) positive for Oct4:GFP+ colonies did not contain noticeable numbers of cells bearing hematopoietic morphology (Figure 2B), confirming our observation that most progeny became reprogrammed using the imaging approach (Movie S1). Many of these wells contained multiple sister colonies, with small numbers of round-shaped cells (also Oct4:GFP+) in close proximity to the larger colonies (Figure 2B), which we have described previously to result from the dynamic migrative behavior associated with pluripotency (Megyola et al., 2013Megyola C.M. Gao Y. Teixeira A.M. Cheng J. Heydari K. Cheng E.C. Nottoli T. Krause D.S. Lu J. Guo S. Dynamic migration and cell-cell interactions of early reprogramming revealed by high-resolution time-lapse imaging.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To ensure that all GMP-derived cells were scored, we repeated single-cell reprogramming with GMPs from a transgenic mouse line that expresses an H2B-GFP fusion protein (Hadjantonakis and Papaioannou, 2004Hadjantonakis A.K. Papaioannou V.E. Dynamic in vivo imaging and cell tracking using a histone fluorescent protein fusion in mice.BMC Biotechnol. 2004; 4: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) so that all progeny could be identified based on their expression of H2B-GFP (Figure S1C). In wells that contained GMP-derived colonies, all H2B-GFP+ cells were part of or close to mESC-like colonies and were positive for alkaline phosphatase activity (Figure 2C, top). In contrast, single lineage-negative-Kit+Sca+ HSPCs (referred to as LKS cells, sorting strategy in Figure S1B) gave rise to many H2B-GFP+ cells that scattered away from the colonies and were negative for alkaline phosphatase activity (Figure 2C, bottom). These data from clonal reprogramming conditions indicate that a subset of GMPs produce essentially all-reprogrammed progeny. To further ensure that all GMP-derived progeny were analyzed, including some that might have adopted alternative cell fate, we trypsinized the entire reprogramming culture initiated from GMPs and assessed the complete cellular constituents by FACS on day 6 of factor expression. We used a pan hematopoietic marker, CD45, to mark the somatic cell state and Oct4:GFP for the pluripotent state. Consistent with the observation that the progeny of 17% of GMPs all turned on Oct4:GFP+, the entire culture was largely binary, consisting of two major populations: the CD45+ hematopoietic cells and the Oct4:GFP+ reprogrammed cells (Figures 2D and S1D). These two populations accounted for ∼97% of all cells in the culture, with the remaining 3% likely being the feeder cells, as indicated by their noncharacteristic scattering profile (Figure S1D). This analysis demonstrates that alternative cell fates are not prevalent in GMP-initiated reprogramming. Another anticipated feature of nonstochastic reprogramming is a synchronous short latency, which could be reflected as either the number of cell divisions or the amount of time preceding endogenous pluripotency activation (Figure 1B). We assessed these parameters using the imaging data and found that most of these progeny (85%, total n = 38) activated endogenous Oct4 after four to five cell divisions (Figure 2E). The remaining 15% of events took six or seven cell divisions, but not more. Expressed in absolute amount of time, all progeny became Oct4:GFP+ (detectible by fluorescence microscopy) within 46.0 ± 6.8 hr (n = 38), indicating a largely uniform fast kinetics. Importantly, this latency is highly consistent among the 14 GMP lineages obtained across five experiments. These results support the privileged nature of the founder GMPs and demonstrate that Yamanaka reprogramming could occur much more rapidly and synchronously than previously appreciated (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Saha K. Pando B. van Zon J. Lengner C.J. Creyghton M.P. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Direct cell reprogramming is a stochastic process amenable to acceleration.Nature. 2009; 462: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data above demonstrate that a subset of GMPs exist as privileged cells for Yamanaka reprogramming. We next asked whether the privileged cells display any unusual characteristics. We examined the live-cell imaging data, quantified the timing of events in the GMP-initiated reprogramming lineages, and noticed that the first cell cycle (defined as the time between the first and second mitotic divisions from the initial cells; diagram in Figure S1A and Figure 2A) on average took only ∼8 hr (Figure 3A). In contrast, a typical mammalian cell cycle lasts 16–24 hr or longer (Lodish et al., 2000Lodish H. Berk A. Zipursky S.L. Molecular Cell Biology.Cell-Cycle Control in Mammalian Cells. W. H. Freeman, New York2000Google Scholar). mESCs and iPSCs display one of the fastest cell cycles, which lasts ∼12 hr, owning to a truncated G1 phase (Hanna et al., 2010Hanna J.H. Saha K. Jaenisch R.

Blelloch R. Cell cycle regulation by MicroRNAs in embryonic stem cells.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4093-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, it was striking that the first cell cycle during privileged reprogramming was even substantially faster than that of mESCs. The three subsequent cell cycles were also fast but became increasingly longer and stabilized at the speed of ∼12 hr per cycle (Figure 3A). Using a cell-cycle phase reporter (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008Sakaue-Sawano A. Kurokawa H. Morimura T. Hanyu A. Hama H. Osawa H. Kashiwagi S. Fukami K. Miyata T. Miyoshi H. et al.Visualizing spatiotemporal dynamics of multicellular cell-cycle progression.Cell. 2008; 132: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar), we observed a short G1 duration (∼2 hr) for the first cell cycle (Figures 3B and S2 and Movie S2). These data suggest that G1 shortening underlies the fast cell cycle. Importantly, because this ultrafast cycle occurred within the first 10 hr of Dox addition and the subsequent cycles actually lengthened when factors were continued to be induced (Figure 3A), the fast cycling property should be intrinsic to the subset of GMPs and independent from Yamanaka factors. Indeed, ∼20% of all GMPs examined (n = 54) display such an ultrafast cell cycle. Thus, privileged GMPs are associated with an ultrafast initial cell cycle.Figure S2Assessing G1 Phase Duration Using the FUCCI Reporter, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full captionGMPs from the Rosa26:rtTA x Oct4:GFP mice were co-transduced with the polycistronic reprogramming virus together with the G1 FUCCI reporter expressing mKO (the red fluorescence signal is diagramed in Figure 2A and Figure S1A).

This same lineage is also shown in Movie S2. If privileged GMPs are distinguished by an ultrafast cell cycle, one would predict that prospectively isolated faster cycling GMPs reprogram with higher efficiency than do their slower cycling counterparts. To test this, we fractionated GMPs based on their cell-cycle speed, using a dye dilution approach (Koche et al., 2011Koche R.P. Smith Z.D. Adli M. Gu H. Ku M. Gnirke A. Bernstein B.E. Meissner A. Reprogramming factor expression initiates widespread targeted chromatin remodeling.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 96-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, Takizawa et al., 2011Takizawa H. Regoes R.R. Boddupalli C.S. Bonhoeffer S. Manz M.G. Dynamic variation in cycling of hematopoietic stem cells in steady state and inflammation.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Specifically, GMPs were labeled with a stable dye CFSE, and the number of divisions that each cell experienced was indicated by the remaining amount of dye after proliferation-based dye dilution (Figure S3). Thus, the cells that retained the least amount of dyes represented the most rapidly cycling cells (Figure 3C). With this strategy, we sorted factor-transduced GMPs into CFSE-low and CFSE-high single cells (representing relatively fast and slow cycling GMPs, respectively) (Figure 3C) and compared their reprogramming efficiency (Figure 3D). The fast cycling GMPs reprogrammed with higher efficiency than the slower cycling ones (Figure 3D and Tables S2A and S2B). To rule out the possibility that this difference was due to the cycling status affecting viral transduction (even though lentivirus infect both cycling and quiescent cells), we confirmed this finding using GMPs from a mouse strain harboring a knockin cassette of the same polycistron (referred to as the iPS mouse) (Carey et al., 2010Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Beard C. Hanna J. Jaenisch R. Single-gene transgenic mouse strains for reprogramming adult somatic cells.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) (Table S2C). Taken together, the data above support that privileged GMPs are associated with an ultrafast cell cycle, and the subpopulation of faster cycling GMPs reprogram more efficiently. The unusual cell-cycle speed that associated with privileged GMPs raises the possibility that the ultrafast cell cycle represents a path to overcome the bottleneck restricting reprogramming. We reasoned that, for a cell that cycles slowly and reprograms inefficiently, increasing its cycling speed may enhance its reprogramming and privileged cells could be potentially induced. LKS cells cycle slowly and contain much fewer ultrafast cycling cells as compared to GMPs (Figures 4A, black bars, and S4 and Table S3). Accordingly, LKS cells reprogrammed with much lower (7.6-fold) efficiency than did GMPs in single-cell reprogramming assays (Figure 4B, black bars and Table S4), consistent with a previous report (Eminli et al., 2009Eminli S. Foudi A. Stadtfeld M. Maherali N. Ahfeldt T. Mostoslavsky G. Hock H. Hochedlinger K. Differentiation stage determines potential of hematopoietic cells for reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Importantly, LKS cells mostly reprogrammed in a stochastic manner, i.e., single LKS cells gave rise to both reprogrammed cells and substantial numbers of nonreprogrammed cells (Figure 2C, bottom).Figure S4Scoring Cell Divisions following Single-Cell Sorting into Terasaki Plates and Simulation of Cell-Cycle Lengths, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Representative images of cells identified in Terasaki plates.

Using this approach, ∼20% fresh GMPs were found to be ultrafast cycling (Figure 4A, columns in red box), which is in agreement with direct measurement by time-lapse imaging as shown in Figure 3A. While the fast cycling of GMPs is required to sustain rapid tissue turnover, stem cells remain largely quiescent to sustain lifelong tissue homeostasis and injury repair and only begin cycling in response to proper cues (Greco and Guo, 2010Greco V. Guo S. Compartmentalized organization: a common and required feature of stem cell niches?.Development. 2010; 137: 1586-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether culturing LKS cells in growth factors/cytokines increases the ultrafast cycling cells (Figure S4). Indeed, after 5 days of culture, an ultrafast cycling population (>16%) emerged from the LKS culture to a level even higher than freshly isolated GMPs (Figure 4A, red bars). In contrast, GMPs cultured under the same condition resulted in a drastic loss of the ultrafast cells (Figure 4B, red bars). We then tested the reprogramming efficiency of these cultured cells in the stringent clonal reprogramming assay (scheme in Figure S5B ). As a comparison, the transduced LKS or GMP cells from the same experiment were single cell sorted and reprogrammed directly without preculture (scheme in Figure S5A). Consistent with the increase in the ultrafast cycling population, cultured LKS cells became highly efficient (24.3%) in reprogramming, more so than the freshly isolated GMPs (18.3%) (Figure 4B, red bars, and Table S4). In addition, the drastic decrease of the ultrafast cycling population in cultured GMPs was accompanied by a steep drop of reprogramming efficiency to 0.5% (Figure 4B). These data indicate that changes in cycling speed parallel the changes in reprogramming efficiency. The cultivation turned a single LKS cell into tens to hundreds of cells (scheme in Figure S5B). Sampling a pool of the mixed progeny from many LKS cells revealed ultrafast cycling behavior in a fraction of them (Figure 4A). It is conceivable that, if the ultrafast cycling behavior is shared by the daughters of a common LKS cell, privileged reprogramming might occur simultaneously from the many daughter cells. To test this, we transferred the somatic progeny from single LKS cells into reprogramming conditions (Figure S5B). After 5 days of Dox induction, we observed the astounding appearanc"

Here, we show that select microenvironments can underlie resistance to antibody-based therapy. Using a humanized model of treatment refractory B cell leukemia, we find that infiltration of leukemia cells into the bone marrow rewires the tumor microenvironment to inhibit engulfment of antibody-targeted tumor cells. Resistance to macrophage-mediated killing can be overcome by combination regimens involving therapeutic antibodies and chemotherapy. Specifically, the nitrogen mustard cyclophosphamide induces an acute secretory activating phenotype (ASAP), releasing CCL4, IL8, VEGF, and TNFα from treated tumor cells. These factors induce macrophage infiltration and phagocytic activity in the bone marrow. Thus, the acute induction of stress-related cytokines can effectively target cancer cells for removal by the innate immune system. This synergistic chemoimmunotherapeutic regimen represents a potent strategy for using conventional anticancer agents to alter the tumor microenvironment and promote the efficacy of targeted therapeutics."

In this work, we expand the scope and capabilities of the PACE method with two key advances that enable the evolution of biomolecules with radically altered or highly specific new activities. First, we implemented small molecule-controlled modulation of selection stringency that enables otherwise inaccessible activities to be evolved directly from inactive starting libraries through a period of evolutionary drift. Second, we developed a general negative selection that enables continuous counterselection against undesired activities. We integrated these developments to continuously evolve mutant T7 RNA polymerase enzymes with ∼10,000-fold altered, rather than merely broadened, substrate specificities during a single three-day PACE experiment. The evolved enzymes exhibit specificity for their target substrate that exceeds that of wild-type RNA polymerases for their cognate substrates while maintaining wild type-like levels of activity."
https://openalex.org/W2042258261,"Diffuse infiltrative invasion is a major cause for the dismal prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Using human glioma stem cells (GSCs) that recapitulate the invasive propensity of primary GBM, we find that EphA2 critically regulates GBM invasion in vivo. EphA2 was expressed in all seven GSC lines examined, and overexpression of EphA2 enhanced intracranial invasion. The effects required Akt-mediated phosphorylation of EphA2 on serine 897. In vitro the Akt–EphA2 signaling axis is maintained in the absence of ephrin-A ligands and is disrupted upon ligand stimulation. To test whether ephrin-As in tumor microenvironment can regulate GSC invasion, the newly established Efna1;Efna3;Efna4 triple knockout mice (TKO) were used in an ex vivo brain slice invasion assay. We observed significantly increased GSC invasion through the brain slices of TKO mice relative to wild-type (WT) littermates. Mechanistically EphA2 knockdown suppressed stem cell properties of GSCs, causing diminished self-renewal, reduced stem marker expression and decreased tumorigenicity. In a subset of GSCs, the reduced stem cell properties were associated with lower Sox2 expression. Overexpression of EphA2 promoted stem cell properties in a kinase-independent manner and increased Sox2 expression. Disruption of Akt-EphA2 cross-talk attenuated stem cell marker expression and neurosphere formation while having minimal effects on tumorigenesis. Taken together, the results show that EphA2 endows invasiveness of GSCs in vivo in cooperation with Akt and regulates glioma stem cell properties."

To ensure appropriate amino acid balance, many species reject a diet lacking one or several essential amino acids (EAAs) and seek out a better food source. Here, we show that, in Drosophila larvae, this behavior relies on innate sensing of amino acids in dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the brain. We demonstrate that the amino acid sensor GCN2 acts upstream of GABA signaling in DA neurons to promote avoidance of the EAA-deficient diet. Using real-time calcium imaging in larval brains, we show that amino acid imbalance induces a rapid and reversible activation of three DA neurons that are necessary and sufficient for food rejection. Taken together, these data identify a central amino-acid-sensing mechanism operating in specific DA neurons and controlling food intake."

Here we show that the dynein-binding protein Lis1 is critically required for hematopoietic stem cell function and leukemogenesis. Conditional deletion of Lis1 (also known as Pafah1b1) in the hematopoietic system led to a severe bloodless phenotype, depletion of the stem cell pool and embryonic lethality. Further, real-time imaging revealed that loss of Lis1 caused defects in spindle positioning and inheritance of cell fate determinants, triggering accelerated differentiation. Finally, deletion of Lis1 blocked the propagation of myeloid leukemia and led to a marked improvement in survival, suggesting that Lis1 is also required for oncogenic growth. These data identify a key role for Lis1 in hematopoietic stem cells and mark its directed control of asymmetric division as a critical regulator of normal and malignant hematopoietic development."

We reveal a widespread and diverse network of spinal dual-axon neurons, with coincident input to forelimb motor neurons and the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN) in the brainstem. Spinal information to the LRN is not segregated by motor pool or neurotransmitter identity. Instead, it is organized according to the developmental domain origin of the progenitor cells. Thus, excerpts of most spinal information destined for action are relayed to supraspinal centers through exquisitely organized ascending connectivity modules, enabling precise communication between command and execution centers of movement."

In this paper, we introduce population-specific probability maps to guide the brain extraction of diverse subject groups, including both healthy and diseased adult human populations, both developing and aging human populations, as well as non-human primates. Specifically, the proposed method combines an atlas-based approach, for coarse skull-stripping, with a deformable-surface-based approach that is guided by local intensity information and population-specific prior information learned from a set of real brain images for more localized refinement. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations were performed on the diverse large-scale populations of ADNI dataset with over 800 subjects (55 ∼ 90 years of age, multi-site, various diagnosis groups), OASIS dataset with over 400 subjects (18 ∼ 96 years of age, wide age range, various diagnosis groups), and NIH pediatrics dataset with 150 subjects (5 ∼ 18 years of age, multi-site, wide age range as a complementary age group to the adult dataset). The results demonstrate that our method consistently yields the best overall results across almost the entire human life span, with only a single set of parameters. To demonstrate its capability to work on non-human primates, the proposed method is further evaluated using a rhesus macaque dataset with 20 subjects. Quantitative comparisons with popularly used state-of-the-art methods, including BET, Two-pass BET, BET-B, BSE, HWA, ROBEX and AFNI, demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably with superior performance on all testing datasets, indicating its robustness and effectiveness."

Exogenous application of membrane-derived lipids, such as arachidonic acid (AA), regulates the gating of Kv channels. Whether membrane-derived lipids released under physiological conditions have an impact on neuronal coding through this mechanism is unknown. We show that AA released in an activity-dependent manner from postsynaptic hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells acts as retrograde messenger, inducing a robust facilitation of mossy fiber (Mf) synaptic transmission over several minutes. AA acts by broadening presynaptic APs through the direct modulation of Kv channels. This form of short-term plasticity can be triggered when postsynaptic cell fires with physiologically relevant patterns and sets the threshold for the induction of the presynaptic form of long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal Mf synapses. Hence, direct modulation of presynaptic Kv channels by activity-dependent release of lipids serves as a physiological mechanism for tuning synaptic transmission."

Furthermore, these receptors can signal to initiate processes that lead to functional differentiation into one of many specific cellular adhesion structures, such as neuronal and immune synapses. However, the role of extracellular structure and ligand-receptor affinity in modulating the plethora of functions resulting from CAM engagement is not well understood. It is not clear whether adhesion is structurally permissive and simply serves as “molecular velcro” or whether the biophysical characteristics of the interactions are critical in triggering distinct functional outcomes. A group of CAMs utilized in animals in many different adhesion structures is the family of proteins homologous to C. elegans SYG-1 and SYG-2, which are immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) CAMs (Ig-CAMs) (Figure 1A) (Shen and Bargmann, 2003Shen K.

These proteins not only specify synaptogenesis by mediating adhesion between guidepost vulval epithelial cells and the axon of the hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSN) in C. elegans (Figure 1A), but also have adopted many other functions in arthropods and in vertebrates. SYG-1 and SYG-2 homologs are known to mediate muscle formation by specifying the fusion of muscle progenitor cells (myoblasts) in Drosophila and vertebrates (Dworak et al., 2001Dworak H.A.

Intriguingly, orthologs of SYG-1 and SYG-2 have also been adopted in arthropods and vertebrates for building the hemolymph and blood filtration barriers, respectively, confirming that the two organs are evolutionarily related (Weavers et al., 2009Weavers H. Prieto-Sánchez S. Grawe F. Garcia-López A. Artero R. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. Ruiz-Gómez M. Skaer H. Denholm B. The insect nephrocyte is a podocyte-like cell with a filtration slit diaphragm.Nature. 2009; 457: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Mutations in the human SYG-2 ortholog, Nephrin, lead to a kidney disease called the congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (Kestilä et al., 1998Kestilä M. Lenkkeri U. Männikkö M. Lamerdin J. McCready P. Putaala H. Ruotsalainen V. Morita T. Nissinen M.

Cell. 1998; 1: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). SYG family proteins, therefore, constitute one of the most important and versatile CAMs in metazoans, involved in disparate cell adhesion functions ranging from synaptogenesis to blood filtration in kidney. Despite their prominence, the membrane-proximal downstream signaling events that result from extracellular engagement of SYGs and their orthologs are not entirely clear. Vertebrate Nephrins are known to be phosphorylated, which leads to actin attachment (Jones et al., 2006Jones N. Blasutig I.M. Eremina V. Ruston J.M. Bladt F. Li H. Huang H. Larose L. Li S.S.-C.

Invest. 2006; 116: 1346-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), whereas F-actin is recruited for SYG-specified synapse development in C. elegans (Chia et al., 2012Chia P.H. Patel M.R. Shen K. NAB-1 instructs synapse assembly by linking adhesion molecules and F-actin to active zone proteins.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). C. elegans SYG-1 also controls synapse elimination through directly inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase SCFSEL-10 (Ding et al., 2007Ding M. Chao D. Wang G. Shen K. Spatial regulation of an E3 ubiquitin ligase directs selective synapse elimination.Science. 2007; 317: 947-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The most conserved intracellular feature of SYGs, a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding peptide, mediates interactions with juxtamembrane scaffolding proteins such as ZO-1 and X11Lα (Huber et al., 2003Huber T.B.

The adaptor protein X11Lalpha/Dmint1 interacts with the PDZ-binding domain of the cell recognition protein Rst in Drosophila.Dev. Biol. 2006; 289: 296-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Despite their importance in many aspects of animal physiology, the molecular basis of SYG-1 and SYG-2 interactions at cellular adhesion sites and the role of structure in specifying function are not known. Here, we ask whether the structural and biophysical features of SYG extracellular complexes are important for conveying a proper functional outcome. Through a series of biochemical, biophysical, and in vivo functional experiments, we find that the extracellular affinity, docking geometry, and rigidity of the SYG-1 and SYG-2 ectodomains play crucial roles in specifying a functional synaptic architecture in C. elegans. The relative abilities of SYGs and their orthologs to form homo- versus heterophilic complexes reflect the acquisition of functional specification and response to evolutionary pressures unique to each phylum. However, it is not clear which SYGs engage one another directly. Thus, we measured the homo- and heterotypic interactions between a variety of SYG-1- and SYG-2-related proteins (Figure 1A), which were previously studied with cell aggregation assays and by coimmunoprecipitation and had yielded conflicting conclusions (Bao and Cagan, 2005Bao S.

Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we showed that C. elegans SYG-1 and SYG-2 ectodomains form a complex with a dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼0.6 μM (Figure S1 and Table S1 available online). We also expressed the first immunoglobulin (Ig) domain of SYG-1 and the first four Ig domains of SYG-2 for crystallization, and these bound with similar affinity as the full-length ectodomains (Figure S1 and Table S1). These interactions are conserved across SYG orthologs, as we showed that the Drosophila homologs of SYG-1 (Rst and Duf/Kirre) and of SYG-2 (SNS and Hbs) all form heterocomplexes with affinities between 1 and 4 μM (Figure S2 and Table S1). Minimal complex-forming regions of the homologous Drosophila system were similarly mapped to within the first Ig domain of Rst or Duf and the first four Ig domains of SNS or Hbs (Figure S2 and Table S1). The similarity of the ectodomain interaction parameters among Drosophila and C. elegans SYGs suggests that this moderate affinity has been evolutionarily refined as optimal for SYG function. Various SYG-1- and SYG-2-like proteins have been previously reported to form homophilic complexes (Dworak et al., 2001Dworak H.A. Charles M.A. Pellerano L.B. Sink H.

However, using a multivalent assay format to enhance avidity that we recently developed for detecting extracellular interactions (Özkan et al., 2013Özkan E. Carrillo R.A. Eastman C.L. Weiszmann R.

We showed with SPR that the Rst homophilic complex was very low affinity (Figure S2I). We did not detect a C. elegans SYG-1 homophilic complex or homophilic and heterophilic complexes between any SYG-2, which is in agreement with the previous reports on SYG interactions using S2 cell aggregation assays for C. elegans and Drosophila SYGs (Shen et al., 2004Shen K.

Charles M.A. Pellerano L.B. Sink H. Characterization of Drosophila hibris, a gene related to human nephrin.Development. 2001; 128: 4265-4276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We cannot, however, rule out very weak cis-homophilic interactions for SYG-1 and SYG-2, as suggested by Shelton et al., 2009Shelton C. Kocherlakota K.S. Zhuang S. Abmayr S.M. The immunoglobulin superfamily member Hbs functions redundantly with Sns in interactions between founder and fusion-competent myoblasts.Development. 2009; 136: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and Wanner et al., 2011Wanner N. Noutsou F. Baumeister R. Walz G. Huber T.B. Neumann-Haefelin E.

To acquire molecular insights into SYG-1 surfaces and the homophilic interactions of its orthologs, we first determined the crystal structures of the first domain (D1) and the first two domains (D1D2) of C. elegans SYG-1 (Figure 1B and Table S2). The D1 and D2 domains both adopt the canonical immunoglobulin fold with two β sheets and a conserved disulfide bond linking the sheets through the B and F strands (Bork et al., 1994Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. The immunoglobulin fold. Structural classification, sequence patterns and common core.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). The Ig domains are colinear, exhibiting extensive interdomain contacts and segmental rigidity due to the absence of linker residues between the two domains (Figure S4A). We did not observe homodimers for any of these structures. We then determined crystal structures of D1D2 of Drosophila Rst, the D1 of Drosophila Duf, and the D1D2 of mouse Neph1. In contrast to C. elegans SYG-1, we observe homodimeric structures for all of these SYG-1 orthologs mediated entirely by their D1 domains, which is consistent with our biochemical data (Figure 1C, Rst is shown). The homodimers are formed through interactions between the C′CFG sheets of the Ig domains (Figures 1C and 1D). The monomers create homodimers by docking against each other at nearly orthogonal angles of 90° to 110° (Figure 1C), and this interaction geometry is conserved between the three SYG-1-like homodimers. The buried surface area of the homodimers is 1,270 Å2 ± 50 Å2. These structures argue that arthropod and mammalian, but not nematode, SYG-1 orthologs homodimerize via the observed common interface. Three residues are prominent within the homophilic interface: Q59, F65, and Q108 in Rst sequence numbering (Figure 1E). The 2-fold symmetry axis relating the complex monomers bisects the two Q59 residues, whose contacts are mediated by two hydrogen bonds. F65 sits in a pocket, packing against the side chain of Q108. To probe the energetic landscape of this interface, we used the extracellular interactome assay (Özkan et al., 2013Özkan E. Carrillo R.A. Eastman C.L. Weiszmann R. Waghray D. Johnson K.G. Zinn K. Celniker S.E. Garcia K.C. An extracellular interactome of immunoglobulin and LRR proteins reveals receptor-ligand networks.Cell. 2013; 154: 228-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) to detect Rst homodimerization (Figures 1E and 1F). We mutated Q59, F65, Q108, and R120, another F65-contacting residue. Alanine mutations of Q59 and F65 abolished the interaction, whereas Q108 and R120 diminished it significantly (Figure 1F). Q59 and Q108 are conserved in all SYG-1s, R120 is conserved in all nonnematode SYG-1s, and F65 is part of a conserved hydrophobic patch (Figure 3D). Interestingly, all the mutations measured in the interactome assay that diminished homophilic interactions also diminished the heterophilic interactions (Figure 1F), indicating that these interaction interfaces overlap. To visualize the molecular basis of the heterophilic interaction, we determined the crystal structure of the C. elegans SYG-1/SYG-2 complex containing the two N-terminal Ig domains of SYG-1 and the four N-terminal Ig domains of SYG-2 (Figures 2A and 2B ). We solved the structure in several steps, using molecular replacement with our two-domain SYG-1 structure, de novo phasing of the fourth domain of SYG-2, followed by manual building of the remaining SYG-2 domains aided by a SYG-2 D3D4 crystal structure. In accord with prior structure-function analysis (Chao and Shen, 2008Chao D.L. Shen K. Functional dissection of SYG-1 and SYG-2, cell adhesion molecules required for selective synaptogenesis in C. elegans.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 39: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and in vitro mutational binding results (Figure 1F), the interaction between SYG-1 and SYG-2 is mediated entirely by their N-terminal Ig domains (D1). The D1s of SYG-1 and SYG-2 engage each other orthogonally at an ∼108° angle, resulting in an unusual L-like shape for the overall complex structure (Figures 2A and 2B). All the domains are colinear with each molecule in an extended conformation due to the lack of linker residues between the domains, resulting in extensive interdomain contacts (Figures S4A–S4C) and an overall rigidification of the molecules (Figure 2). We interrogated the heterophilic interface by measuring the effects of mutations on SYG-1–SYG-2 binding affinity using SPR (Figures 2C and 2D and S3). SYG-1 residues central to the heterophilic interface and crucial for the interaction affinity are F60, Q105, and Q54, which are the equivalent residues that abolished the Rst homophilic interaction when mutated (Figure 1F). At the center of the interface, SYG-1 Q54 interacts with SYG-2 Q53 in the same manner as seen for the Rst Q59 in the homodimer. SYG-1 F60 packs against SYG-2 Q105 within a pocket lined by SYG-2’s F strand; these two residues are equivalent to Rst F65 and Q108, respectively. For SYG-2, the residue homologous to Rst F65 and SYG-1 F60 is a leucine (L61), which forms part of the C-C′ loop of the Ig domain. This loop makes close van der Waals contacts to SYG-1 Q105. We also mutated the SYG-2 residues related to SYG-1/Rst residues Q54/Q59, F60/F65, Q105/Q108, and V116/R120; namely Q53, L61, Q105 and R115 (Figure S3B). Alanine mutagenesis of Q53, L61, and R115 caused an 80- to 330-fold loss in affinity, and Ala mutation of Q105, which packs against the crucial F60 of SYG-1, essentially abolished the interaction. Thus, the energetic parsing of the interface reveals an asymmetry, whereby the SYG-1-F60-SYG-2-Q105 pair is more energetically important for binding than its structurally symmetric SYG-2-L61-SYG-1-Q105 pair. The amino acid contacts mediating the heterophilic SYG-1/SYG-2 complex closely mimic those mediating the homophilic complex interface, revealing a highly uncommon dual specificity within one binding site. First, the heterocomplex of the SYG-1 and SYG-2 D1 domains is essentially superimposable with homodimeric complexes of Rst, Neph1, and Duf with an average of 1.1 ± 0.2 Å root-mean-square deviation (Figure 3A). Second, the SYG-1 residues participating in the homo- and heterophilic interfaces are nearly identical, all belonging to the C′CFG faces of the Ig domains (Figures 3B–3D). Third, loss of both homo- and heterophilic binding is observed when related residues in C. elegans SYG-1 and Drosophila Rst are mutated (Figures 1F, 3B, and 3C). The interaction footprints of the homophilic binding partner on Rst (Figure 3B) and the heterophilic binding partner on SYG-1 (Figure 3C) show similar surfaces and energetic contributions to their respective interactions, with the phenylalanine (F60) and the two glutamines (Q54 and Q105 in SYG-1) being most prominent. The patterns of conservation between SYG-1- and SYG-2-like proteins are a result of the “pseudo”-symmetric nature of the heterophilic interactions, which also allows for the symmetric homophilic interaction. Despite being extended structures with multiple interdomain “joints,” the similarity in the individual Ig domain positions of the SYGs and their orthologs is remarkable (Figure 4A). This highlights a surprising rigidity that contrasts with the notion of “beads on a string” for multidomain CAM proteins with flexible domain boundaries. The rigidity of the SYGs is due to the lack of linker sequences between the Ig domains, forcing close-packed domain boundaries that restrain flexibility (Figures S4A–S4C). This inflexibility could perhaps contribute to formation of a relatively rigid mesh comprised of clustered SYG-1 and SYG-2 molecules at the site of a cell adhesion, such as the kidney filtration barrier"

Moreover, these bacteria specific to IgAN might be candidate for the indicator which can predict the remission of IgAN treated by the combination of tonsillectomy and steroid pulse.We made a comprehensive analysis of tonsil flora in 68 IgAN patients and 28 control patients using Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods. We also analyzed the relationship between several bacteria specific to the IgAN and the prognosis of the IgAN. Treponema sp. were identified in 24% IgAN patients, while in 7% control patients (P = 0.062). Haemophilus segnis were detected in 53% IgAN patients, while in 25% control patients (P = 0.012). Campylobacter rectus were identified in 49% IgAN patients, while in 14% control patients (P = 0.002). Multiple Cox proportional-hazards model revealed that Treponema sp. or Campylobactor rectus are significant for the remission of proteinuria (Hazard ratio 2.35, p = 0.019). There was significant difference in remission rates between IgAN patients with Treponema sp. and those without the bacterium (p = 0.046), and in remission rates between IgAN patients with Campylobacter rectus and those without the bacterium (p = 0.037) by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Those bacteria are well known to be related with the periodontal disease. Periodontal bacteria has known to cause immune reaction and many diseases, and also might cause IgA nephropathy.This insight into IgAN might be useful for diagnosis of the IgAN patients and the decision of treatment of IgAN."

We identified the metastasis-promoting methyltransferase, metastasis-related methyltransferase 1 (WBSCR22/Merm1) as a novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulator relevant to human disease. Merm1 binds the GR co-activator GRIP1 but not GR. Loss of Merm1 impaired both GR transactivation and transrepression by reducing GR recruitment to its binding sites. This was accompanied by loss of GR-dependent H3K4Me3 at a well characterized promoter. Inflammation promotes GC resistance, in part through the actions of TNFα and IFNγ. These cytokines suppressed Merm1 protein expression by driving ubiquitination of two conserved lysine residues. Restoration of Merm1 expression rescued GR transactivation. Cytokine suppression of Merm1 and of GR function was also seen in human lung explants. In addition, striking loss of Merm1 protein was observed in both inflammatory and neoplastic human lung pathologies. In conclusion, Merm1 is a novel regulator of chromatin structure affecting GR recruitment and function, contributing to loss of GC sensitivity in inflammation, with suppressed expression in pulmonary disease."
https://openalex.org/W2157761924,"Early diagnosis of neurological disorders would greatly improve their management and treatment. A major hurdle is that inflammatory products of cerebral disease are not easily detected in blood. Inflammation in multiple organs and heterogeneity in disease present additional challenges in distinguishing the extent to which a blood-based marker reflects disease in brain or other afflicted organs. Murine models of the monogenetic disorder Niemann-Pick Type C present aggressive forms of cerebral and liver inflammatory disease. Microarray analyses previously revealed age-dependent changes in innate immunity transcripts in the mouse brain. We have now validated four putative secretory inflammatory markers that are also elevated in mouse liver. We include limited, first time analysis of human Niemann-Pick Type C liver and cerebellum. Furthermore, we utilized 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD, an emerging therapeutic) administered intraperitoneally in mice, which abrogates inflammatory pathology in the liver but has limited effect on the brain. By analyzing the corresponding effects on inflammatory plasma proteins, we identified cathepsin S as a lead indicator of liver disease. In contrast, lysozyme was a marker of both brain and liver disease. 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin had no effect on transcripts of neuron-specific 24-hydroxylase, and its product 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was not a useful indicator in mouse plasma. Our data suggest that dual analysis of levels of the inflammatory markers lysozyme and cathepsin S may enable detection of multiple distinct states of neurodegeneration in plasma."

In the range of metal concentrations analysed we found that only hexokinase and phosphofructokinase, the enzymes that shared the control of the flux, were inhibited by Hg2+ and Cd2+. The concentrations of the internal metabolites glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate did not change significantly when Hg2+ and Cd2+ were added. A mathematical model was constructed to explore the mechanisms of inhibition of Hg2+ and Cd2+ on hexokinase and phosphofructokinase. Equations derived from detailed mechanistic models for each inhibition were fitted to the experimental data. In a concentration-dependent manner these equations describe the observed inhibition of enzyme activity. Under the conditions analysed, the integral model showed that the simultaneous inhibition of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase explains the observation that the concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate did not change as the heavy metals decreased the glycolytic flux."
https://openalex.org/W2123927793,"Purinergic signaling mediates many cellular processes, including embryonic development and regulation of endocrine signaling. The ADP P2Y13 receptor is known to regulate bone and stem cells activities, although relatively little is known about its role in bone development. In this study we demonstrate, using contemporary techniques, that deletion of the P2Y13 receptor results in an age-dependent skeletal phenotype that is governed by changes in phosphate metabolism and hormone levels. Neonatal and postnatal (2 wk) P2Y13 receptor-knockout (KO) mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type (WT) littermate controls. A clear bone phenotype was observed in young (4-wk-old) KO mice compared WT controls, with 14% more trabecular bone, 35% more osteoblasts, 73% fewer osteoclasts, and a 17% thicker growth plate. Mature (>10 wk of age) KO mice showed the opposite bone phenotype, with 14% less trabecular bone, 22% fewer osteoblasts, and 10% thinner growth plate. This age-dependent phenotype correlated with serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and phosphorus levels that were 65 and 16% higher, respectively, in young KO mice but remained unchanged in mature mice. These findings provide novel insights for the role of the P2Y13 receptor in skeletal development via coordination with hormonal regulators of phosphate homeostasis.—Wang, N., Robaye, B., Gossiel, F., Boeynaems, J.-M., Gartland, A.

https://openalex.org/W2025202081,"Chemokines control cell migration in many contexts including development, homeostasis, immune surveillance and inflammation. They are also involved in a wide range of pathological conditions ranging from inflammatory diseases and cancer, to HIV. Chemokines function by interacting with two types of receptors: G protein-coupled receptors on the responding cells, which transduce signaling pathways associated with cell migration and activation, and glycosaminoglycans on cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix which organize and present some chemokines on immobilized surface gradients. To probe these interactions, imaging methods and fluorescence-based assays are becoming increasingly desired. Herein, a method for site-specific fluorescence labeling of recombinant chemokines is described. It capitalizes on previously reported 11-12 amino acid tags and phosphopantetheinyl transferase enzymes to install a fluorophore of choice onto a specific serine within the tag through a coenzyme A-fluorophore conjugate. The generality of the method is suggested by our success in labeling several chemokines (CXCL12, CCL2, CCL21 and mutants thereof) and visualizing them bound to chemokine receptors and glycosaminoglycans. CXCL12 and CCL2 showed the expected co-localization on the surface of cells with their respective receptors CXCR4 and CCR2 at 4 °C, and co-internalization with their receptors at 37 °C. By contrast, CCL21 showed the presence of large discrete puncta that were dependent on the presence of both CCR7 and glycosaminoglycans as co-receptors. These data demonstrate the utility of this labeling approach for the detection of chemokine interactions with GAGs and receptors, which can vary in a chemokine-specific manner as shown here. For some applications, the small size of the fluorescent adduct may prove advantageous compared to other methods (e.g. antibody labeling, GFP fusion) by minimally perturbing native interactions. Other advantages of the method are the ease of bacterial expression, the versatility of labeling with any maleimide-fluorophore conjugate of interest, and the covalent nature of the fluorescent adduct."
https://openalex.org/W2133549402,"Background Striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) are susceptible to infection with some influenza A viruses. However, the viral shedding capability of this peri-domestic mammal and its potential role in influenza A virus ecology are largely undetermined. Methodology/Principal Findings Striped skunks were experimentally infected with a low pathogenic (LP) H4N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) and monitored for 20 days post infection (DPI). All of the skunks exposed to H4N6 AIV shed large quantities of viral RNA, as detected by real-time RT-PCR and confirmed for live virus with virus isolation, from nasal washes and oral swabs (maximum ≤106.02 PCR EID50 equivalent/mL and ≤105.19 PCR EID50 equivalent/mL, respectively). Some evidence of potential fecal shedding was also noted. Following necropsy on 20 DPI, viral RNA was detected in the nasal turbinates of one individual. All treatment animals yielded evidence of a serological response by 20 DPI. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that striped skunks have the potential to shed large quantities of viral RNA through the oral and nasal routes following exposure to a LP AIV. Considering the peri-domestic nature of these animals, along with the duration of shedding observed in this species, their presence on poultry and waterfowl operations could influence influenza A virus epidemiology. For example, this species could introduce a virus to a naive poultry flock or act as a trafficking mechanism of AIV to and from an infected poultry flock to naive flocks or wild bird populations."

The transcription factor NF-κB participates in the expression of a wide variety of genes that are involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, proliferation, tumorigenesis, and survival (10DiDonato J.A.

Celebrating 25 years of NF-κB research.Immunol. Rev. 2012; 246: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Research in recent years has defined two distinct NF-κB activation pathways, termed the classical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathways (10DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. NF-κB and the link between inflammation and cancer.Immunol. Rev. 2012; 246: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 11Ghosh S. Hayden M.S. Celebrating 25 years of NF-κB research.Immunol. Rev. 2012; 246: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Classical NF-κB activation is based on inducible IκB degradation. This pathway can be rapidly and transiently activated by a large variety of substances, such as mitogens, cytokines, and microbial components. This activation is dependent upon a specific IκB kinase (IKK) that is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), and the regulatory subunit NEMO (IKKγ). In contrast, the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway is activated by a select group of TNF receptors, such as CD40, lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR), and RANK. Among these factors, RANK is activated by RANKL and transduces signals through either the classical or alternative pathways. The activation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) results in the activation of IKKα homodimers and the processing of the p100 precursor to p52. The processing of p105 to p50 occurs constitutively, whereas the processing of p100 to p52 is stimulus-dependent. The removal of the ankyrin repeats from p100 reduces its IκB-like activity, and the processing of p100 allows for the nuclear translocation of RelB, which may heterodimerize with either p52 or p50 and result in subsequent gene transcription (10DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. NF-κB and the link between inflammation and cancer.Immunol. Rev. 2012; 246: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 11Ghosh S. Hayden M.S.

Alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice have a natural loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the NF-κB-inducing kinase Nik (12Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K.

Therefore, aly/aly mice are useful for understanding the physiological role of the alternative NF-κB pathway in tissue development and regeneration. We have previously shown that aly/aly mice have mild osteopetrosis with increased bone volume due to a significantly reduced number of osteoclasts (14Soysa N.S. Alles N. Weih D. Lovas A. Mian A.H.

Nfkb2lym1/lym1 mice contain a novel mutation in Nfkb2 that encodes a non-processable form of p100 and have phenotypes that are similar to those of aly/aly mice, such as abnormalities of splenic architecture and mild osteopetrosis (16Tucker E.

In contrast, p100-deficient mice, which carry a homozygous deletion of the COOH-terminal ankyrin repeats of p100 but still express functional p52 protein, have precisely the opposite bone phenotype of aly/aly mice: osteopenia with an increased number of osteoclasts (14Soysa N.S.

These results suggest that alternative NF-κB signaling regulates osteoclast differentiation. The number of osteoclasts that are induced by RANKL strongly correlates with the ratio of p52 to p100 expression levels (15Maruyama T. Fukushima H. Nakao K. Shin M. Yasuda H. Weih F. Doi T. Aoki K.

Res. 2010; 25: 1058-1067PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of highly distinct classical and alternative NF-κB pathways, which lead to the activation of p65 and RelB, respectively, suggests that these two subunits have different biological functions. The IκB-like domain of p100 retains p65 or RelB in the cytoplasm and inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in NIK-deficient (NIK−/−) cells (17Novack D.V. Yin L. Hagen-Stapleton A. Schreiber R.D.

Furthermore, the overexpression of RelB, but not p65, in NIK−/− cells rescues RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (18Vaira S. Johnson T. Hirbe A.C. Alhawagri M. Anwisye I. Sammut B. O'Neal J. Zou W. Weilbaecher K.N. Faccio R. Novack D.V. RelB is the NF-κB subunit downstream of NIK responsible for osteoclast differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the molecular mechanism by which the overexpression of RelB rescues the suppression of osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the alternative pathway remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to define the role of the alternative pathway in osteoclast differentiation. Our results demonstrated that the overexpression of RelB rescued RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by inducing NF-κB2 processing in aly/aly bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). A genome-wide screen of RelB-overexpressing BMMs showed that Cot (cancer Osaka thyroid) was induced in RelB-overexpressing BMMs. Cot was initially identified in a screen for transforming genes that were expressed by a human thyroid carcinoma (19Miyoshi J.

Knocking down Cot expression significantly reduced RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by RelB overexpression. The phosphorylation of IKKα at threonine 23 and its kinase activity were indispensable for NF-κB2 processing and osteoclastogenesis by RelB-induced Cot. Furthermore, Akt modulated RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through RelB-induced Cot.

The anti-NFATc1 (ab25916) antibodies and anti-p65 antibodies (SA-171) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) and Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), respectively. The anti-FLAG M5 and β-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. BMMs were prepared as osteoclast precursors from 5–8-week-old male WT, aly/aly, NF-κB2−/−, or RelB−/− mice. Bone marrow cells were obtained from mouse tibias and suspended in 96-well plates for 16 h in the presence of M-CSF (100 ng/ml) in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Non-adherent cells were harvested and further cultured for 2 days with M-CSF (100 ng/ml). More than 90% of the adherent cells that expressed macrophage-specific antigens, such as Mac-1, Moma-2, and F4/80, were used as BMMs (23Fukushima H. Nakao A. Okamoto F. Shin M. Kajiya H. Sakano S.

BMMs were cultured for 3 days with RANKL (100 ng/ml). Cultures were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and osteoclasts were detected by staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). TRAP-positive (TRAP+) multinucleated cells that had more than five nuclei were observed using a microscope and counted as osteoclasts. The 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. BMMs treated with RANKL for the indicated time were lysed in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl and 200 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, pepstatin, dithiothreitol, and leupeptin). The cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (23Fukushima H. Nakao A. Okamoto F. Shin M. Kajiya H. Sakano S. Bigas A. Jimi E. Okabe K. The association of Notch2 and NF-κB accelerates RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 6402-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, an equal amount of protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα antibodies for 2 h; then protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the samples were incubated for another 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and extracted in SDS sample buffer. The lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and immunoblotted with individual antibodies. Then the membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using a Luminescent image analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The retroviral vector pMX-IRES-EGFP and Plat-E cells were kindly provided by Dr. T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo) (24Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T. Kumagai H.

The following constructs were cloned into the pMX-IRES-EGFP vector: the wild-type IKKα; a mutant form of IKKα (IKKαAA) that is not phosphorylated by NIK, with serine to alanine mutations at residues 176 and 180; a mutant form of IKKα (IKKαAAT23A) that is not phosphorylated by NIK or Akt, with serine to alanine mutations at residues 176 and 180 and a threonine to alanine mutation at residue 23; the dominant negative form of IKKα (IKKαKM), with a lysine to methionine mutation at residue 44; wild-type IKKα with a FLAG tag; wild-type p100; and p100ΔGRR, which cannot be processed to p52 (21Lin X.

The constitutively activated form of Akt (AktCA), which lacks amino acids 4–129 and has an HA tag; the dominant negative form of Akt (AktDN), which has a lysine residue 179 to methionine mutation; a wild type, HA-tagged Akt; and Cot expression vectors were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge MA). Retrovirus packaging was performed by transfecting the plasmids into Plate-E cells using the Genejuice (Merck) transfection reagent. The supernatants of all retroviral vector-transfected Plat-E cells were used to infect primary BMMs in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Total RNA of BMMs or osteoclasts from WT or aly/aly mice was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of total RNA was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA using SuperScript II transcriptase and random primers (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and a 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The experimental results were fit to a standard curve that was generated by amplifying serially diluted products under the same PCR conditions. GAPDH expression served as an internal control. The primer sequences were as follows: Cot, 5′-cttgcatttgcaaaccatgc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggaacaaggagaacatccga-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-aactttggcattgtggaagg-3′ (forward) and 5′-acacattggggtaggaaca-3′ (reverse). To construct the luciferase reporter plasmid, a 0.5-kb fragment upstream from the transcription initiation site of the mouse Cot gene was cloned by a standard PCR method using PrimeSTAR DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Siga, Japan) and mouse genomic DNA as a template. It was then subcloned into the HindIII and BamHI recognition sites of the pfLuc-basic vector from Dr. Sankar Ghosh (Columbia University) (26Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S.

Genejuice was used to transfect 293 cells with the reporter plasmids. The luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). ChIP was performed with a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using antibodies against p65, RelB, NF-κB2, and normal IgG. The purified DNA was analyzed by PCR using primers that detect sequences within the region of Cot promoter that harbors the NF-κB binding NF-κB-responsive element. The primer pairs containing the distal NF-κB-responsive element were 5′-aggatctaaaaccgcaaact-3′ (forward) and 5-cttttccatttcccttttct-3′ (reverse). The primers containing the proximal NF-κB-responsive element were 5′-ccaccgacacagaacactca-3′ (forward) and 5′-gtcttgcgcaaggtgttttc-3′ (reverse). Comparisons were made using factorial analysis of variance. When significant F values were detected, Fisher's protected least significant difference post hoc test was performed to compare each of the groups. The data were expressed as the mean ± S.D., and p values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. We previously reported that alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice, in which the processing of p100 to p52 does not occur due to an inactive form of NIK, showed an osteopetrotic phenotype with significantly reduced osteoclast numbers (14Soysa N.S.

Processing of the NF-κB2 precursor, p100, to p52 is critical for RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 1058-1067PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the bone phenotype of NF-κB2−/− mice, which lacks p100 and p52, was normal, and BMMs differentiated to osteoclasts, similar to WT BMMs; this result may be due to compensation for the lack of NF-κB2 by NF-κB1 (15Maruyama T. Fukushima H. Nakao K. Shin M. Yasuda H. Weih F. Doi T. Aoki K. Alles N. Ohya K. Hosokawa R. Jimi E. Processing of the NF-κB2 precursor, p100, to p52 is critical for RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 1058-1067PubMed Google Scholar). BMMs from WT, aly/aly, or NF-κB2−/− mice were treated with RANKL (100 ng/ml) for 6 days in the presence of M-CSF (100 ng/ml). As reported previously (15Maruyama T. Fukushima H. Nakao K. Shin M. Yasuda H. Weih F. Doi T. Aoki K. Alles N. Ohya K. Hosokawa R. Jimi E. Processing of the NF-κB2 precursor, p100, to p52 is critical for RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 1058-1067PubMed Google Scholar), numerous osteoclasts were formed from BMMs in WT and NF-κB2−/− mice, but few osteoclasts were formed from aly/aly BMMs (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, we hypothesized that the residual active p52 moiety, together with its binding partner RelB, eventually translocates into the nucleus to exert transcriptional activity. When BMMs from WT, aly/aly, or NF-κB2−/− mice were treated with RANKL for the indicated time, RANKL led to translocation of p65 to the nucleus; the maximal level of this translocation occurred at 30 min, and the degradation of IκBα coincided with the translocation of p65 in all BMMs (Fig. 1C). The translocation of RelB was observed within 6 h after RANKL stimulation in WT BMMs. RANKL transiently led to the translocation of RelB with kinetics similar to that of p65 translocation in NF-κB2−/− BMMs, which suggests that the RelB-p50 heterodimer translocates into the nucleus after RANKL stimulation in NF-κB2−/− BMMs (27Fusco A.J. Savinova O.V. Talwar R. Kearns J.D. Hoffmann A. Ghosh G. Stabilization of RelB requires multidomain interactions with p100/p52.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12324-12332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, RelB translocation by RANKL stimulation was not observed in aly/aly BMMs (Fig. 1C). The HDAC1 expression levels were comparable in all nuclear extracts from WT, aly/aly, and NF-κB2−/− mice. These results suggested that the translocation of RelB into the nucleus correlates with RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. To confirm that the translocation of RelB is important for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, we transfected p65 or RelB into BMMs from aly/aly mice. The overexpression of p65 failed to rescue RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in aly/aly BMMs (Fig. 2, A–C). In contrast, overexpression of RelB rescued RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in aly/aly mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, the overexpression of RelB induced NF-κB2 processing and NFATc1 expression (Fig. 2C). We previously reported that the osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL correlated well with the ratio of p52 to p100 (15Maruyama T. Fukushima H. Nakao K. Shin M. Yasuda H. Weih F. Doi T. Aoki K.

https://openalex.org/W2153949489,"In mammals, the αβT cell receptor (TCR) signaling complex is composed of a TCRαβ heterodimer that is noncovalently coupled to three dimeric signaling molecules, CD3ϵδ, CD3ϵγ, and CD3ζζ. The nature of the TCR signaling complex and subunit arrangement in different species remains unclear however. Here we present a structural and biochemical analysis of the more primitive ancestral form of the TCR signaling complex found in chickens. In contrast to mammals, chickens do not express separate CD3δ and CD3γ chains but instead encode a single hybrid chain, termed CD3δ/γ, that is capable of pairing with CD3ϵ. The NMR structure of the chicken CD3ϵδ/γ heterodimer revealed a unique dimer interface that results in a heterodimer with considerable deviation from the distinct side-by-side architecture found in human and murine CD3ϵδ and CD3ϵγ. The chicken CD3ϵδ/γ heterodimer also contains a unique molecular surface, with the vast majority of surface-exposed, nonconserved residues being clustered to a single face of the heterodimer. Using an in vitro biochemical assay, we demonstrate that CD3ϵδ/γ can assemble with both chicken TCRα and TCRβ via conserved polar transmembrane sites. Moreover, analogous to the human TCR signaling complex, the presence of two copies of CD3ϵδ/γ is required for ζζ assembly. These data provide insight into the evolution of this critical receptor signaling apparatus.

In humans and other mammals, the TCR signaling complex comprises eight type-I membrane-spanning polypeptides that include the TCR αβ heterodimer, the CD3ϵγ and CD3ϵδ heterodimers, and the CD3ζζ homodimer (1.Call M.E.

This ligand-sensing heterodimer has no intrinsic ability to transmit signals to the cell interior due to the short cytoplasmic tails of the α and β chains of the TCR. Instead, signaling is mediated by the CD3ϵγ, CD3ϵδ, and CD3ζζ subunits that associate with the TCR to produce a complex with a 1TCRαβ-1CD3ϵδ-1CD3ϵγ-1ζζ stoichiometry (1.Call M.E. Pyrdol J.

However, a detailed structural analysis of the extracellular interactions between TCR and CD3 subunits is complicated by the lack of any apparent affinity among these dimeric components in solution. A major energetic contribution to assembly of TCR and CD3 subunits appears to come from a network of polar interactions within the TM domains (26.Alcover A. Mariuzza R.A. Ermonval M. Acuto O. Lysine 271 in the transmembrane domain of the T-cell antigen receptor β chain is necessary for its assembly with the CD3 complex but not for α/β dimerization.J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 14036-14043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the TCRα and the TCRβ TM domains have a central lysine residue that recruits one CD3 heterodimer via a pair of acidic TM residues (28.Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. The organizing principle in the formation of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex.Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Within the mature complex, CD3ϵδ associates exclusively via the TCRα TM domain and CD3ϵγ via the TCRβ TM domain to create an “asymmetric” hexamer. TCRα also contains an arginine residue in the upper half of the TM domain that mediates its interaction with the ζζ homodimer (28.Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W.

The ζζ module will only join a preassembled CD3ϵδ-TCRαβ-CD3ϵγ hexamer, signaling the completion of assembly by masking an ER retention signal in CD3ϵδ (29.Delgado P. Alarcón B. An orderly inactivation of intracellular retention signals controls surface expression of the T cell antigen receptor.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and allowing export to the cell surface. The evolutionary basis for the inclusion of two globally similar CD3 modules in this receptor complex is unclear. There is evidence to suggest that the mammalian CD3δ and CD3γ subunits have evolved novel, nonredundant functions. Both CD3δ and CD3γ knock-out mice exhibit profound defects in the production of mature αβT cells, confirming that both CD3ϵδ and CD3ϵγ modules are absolutely required (30.Dave V.P. Cao Z. Browne C.

Hou X. Dietrich J. Geisler C. Distinct domains of the CD3-γ chain are involved in surface expression and function of the T cell antigen receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4675-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although exchange of TM and cytoplasmic domains was tolerated; thus the folded ectodomains, at least, are non-interchangeable. Nonetheless, the precise nature of their unique functional roles and the significance of their strictly asymmetric assembly with TCR remain unknown. Chickens (ch) and the amphibian Xenopus laevis also express a CD3ϵ-like protein but do not express separate CD3δ and CD3γ chains. Instead, they encode a protein that shares equal homology with both mammalian CD3δ and CD3γ and has thus been designated CD3δ/γ (33.Bernot A. Auffray C. Primary structure and ontogeny of an avian CD3 transcript.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2550-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At the amino acid sequence level, chicken and human CD3ϵ, -δ, and -γ chains have low extracellular (32–34%) and high TM (44–52%) and intracellular (49–55%) sequence identity. Analysis of the CD3 locus suggests that mammalian CD3δ and CD3γ arose from a gene duplication event that occurred 230 million years ago (34.Göbel T.W. Dangy J.P. Evidence for a stepwise evolution of the CD3 family.J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 879-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is likely that the ch-CD3 represents a primordial form that has not diversified in a manner analogous to its mammalian counterpart. To provide further insight into the relationship between the mammalian TCR signaling complex and its evolutionary precursors, we have undertaken a structural and biochemical analysis of the chicken CD3 proteins and their assembly into the chicken TCR signaling complex. The solution NMR structure of the ch-CD3ϵδ/γ ectodomain dimer reveals significant differences from the mouse and human CD3 heterodimers in both domain orientation and surface chemistry. Furthermore, the ch-TCR signaling complex assembly demonstrates that despite the lack of CD3 asymmetry in the chicken receptor system, two CD3ϵδ/γ dimers are required to form a fully assembled complex that is capped by ζζ association. Gene fragments encoding the extracellular domains of mature ch-CD3ϵ (residues 24–91) and CD3δ/γ (residues 18–97) excluding the cysteine-rich stalks were synthesized de novo (GenScript). To generate a single chain construct, the C terminus of ch-CD3ϵ was covalently linked to the N terminus of ch-CD3δ/γ via a 26-amino acid flexible peptide using splice-by-overlap PCR. ch-CD3ϵδ/γ was cloned into a pET28b expression vector downstream of the thrombin-cleavable histidine tag and expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m DTT, 10 mm EDTA and refolded essentially as described (35.Dunstone M.A. Kjer-Nielsen L. Kostenko L. Purcell A.W. Brooks A.G. Rossjohn J. McCluskey J. The production and purification of the human T-cell receptors, the CD3ϵγ and CD3ϵδ heterodimers: complex formation and crystallization with OKT3, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Refolded protein was buffer-exchanged into 10 mm Tris (pH 8) containing 0.5 m NaCl using tangential flow filtration prior to loading on a HisTrap HP nickel column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 0.5 m imidazole. Histidine tag cleavage was performed using agarose-linked thrombin beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final purification step involved gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm EDTA. Suitable NMR buffer conditions were identified as 0.5 mm CD3, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 125 mm arginine, 125 mm glutamate, 0.01% azide, 0.01% Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor, 0.5 mm EDTA using crystallography dialysis buttons. All NMR samples contained 10% 2H2O, and the spectra were recorded at 293 K. The following NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCETM 600-MHz spectrometer with cryoprobe using a 13C,15N-labeled CD3 sample: HNCA, HNCO, HBHA(CO)NH, (H)CCH-TOCSY, H(C)CH-TOCSY, 15N NOESY-HSQC (τm110 ms), HD(CDCG)CB and HE(CECDCG)CB. A 2H,13C,15N-CD3 sample was used to acquire transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy versions of an HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HN(CA)CO, and HN(CO)CA on an 800-MHz Bruker AVANCE fitted with a cryoprobe, and 13C NOESY-HSQC (aliphatic) and 13C NOESY-HSQC (aromatic) (τm110 ms) spectra were acquired on the same spectrometer using the 13C,15N-labeled sample. Spectra were processed using Topspin version 3.0. Backbone amide, and CA, CB, HA, and HB resonances were assigned manually using XEasy (36.Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. The program XEASY for computer-supported NMR spectral analysis of biological macromolecules.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Automated side-chain assignments were made using the ASCAN algorithms of UNIO and verified and supplemented by manual assignments using the HCCH-TOCSY spectra. Structures were calculated using the AtnosCandid automated NOE peak picking and assignment algorithms with CNS torsion angle dynamics starting from an extended chain. The resulting structures were refined in CNS using simulated annealing with Cartesian dynamics. During refinement, dihedral angle restraints predicted from TALOS were incorporated along with hydrogen bond restraints in regions of canonical secondary structure where unique donor-acceptor pairs could be identified by convergence. The 10 lowest energy conformers with no NOE violations >0.3 Å, no bond violations >0.05 Å, and no improper or dihedral angle violations >5° were chosen to represent the solution structure of CD3. The ch-CD3 structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 2MIM), and the chemical shifts have been deposited with the BMRB (code 19687). Epitope tags were used to facilitate immunoprecipitation of chicken TCR components. In all cases, epitope tags were installed at the C terminus of protein with a Gly-Ser linker, which was encoded by the BamHI site used for cloning. Anti-HA-agarose beads (Sigma, A2095) were used to immunoprecipitate chains carrying the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (GYPYDVPDYA). Streptavidin-conjugated beads (Sigma, S1638) were used to precipitate chains carrying the streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) tag (DEKTTGWRGGHVVEGLAGELEQLRARLEHHPQGQREPSSSGGSKLG). Anti-protein C (PC)-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science, 11815024001) were used to immunoprecipitate chains carrying the PC tag (EDQVDPRLIDGK). cDNA encoding CD3ϵ, CD3δ/γ, and ζ were synthesized as G-blocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned into pSP64 (modified by M. Kozak). The chicken cell line MSB1 (37.Akiyama Y. Kato S. Two cell lines from lymphomas of Marek's disease.Biken J. 1974; 17: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar) was the source of cDNA to amplify by standard PCR conditions the coding sequence for TCRα chain (primers: forward CMGTGSGASRAAATGRATTTTS and reverse GCACCCAATGCTCCAGTAAT), which was cloned into the pJET3.1 vector (CloneJet, Fermentas), and for TCRβ chain (primers: forward TTCCSTGCTGGTTTCTTACG and reverse TCCTCTTCAAGGCAAAGCAT), which was cloned into the filled BamHI site of pGEM3zf (Promega). In all cases the natural signal sequence was replaced with that of mouse H2-Kb (MVPCTLLLLLAAALAPTQTRA), ensuring robust and equal targeting of all polypeptide chains to ER microsomes (38.Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. In vitro translation and assembly of a complete T cell receptor-CD3 complex.J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sequences were cloned into pSP64 constructs modified to append an HA, PC, SBP, or no tag (Gly-Ser) to the C terminus as appropriate and a poly(A) tail to the mRNA. mRNA was transcribed in vitro using the RiboMAX large scale RNA T7 production system (Promega, P1300) according to the manufacturer's instructions. m7G Cap analog (Promega, P1712) was supplied in 5-fold excess with respect to ribo-GTP to ensure that mRNA was correctly capped. After mRNA transcription, plasmid DNA was cleaved with RQ1 DNase (Promega, M6101), and mRNA was purified with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, 74104). 25-μl transcription reactions typically yielded 60 μl of mRNA at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Each mRNA was translated alone to ensure that targeting to ER microsomes, signal peptide cleavage, and glycosylation occurred as expected (data not shown). mRNA concentration was adjusted to ensure equivalent translation of each polypeptide. Adjustment factors were determined by densitometry (see below) of deglycosylated (endoglycosidase H-treated) samples. 25-μl in vitro translation reactions contained 17.5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, L4960), 0.5 μl of amino acids without Cys or Met (Promega, L5511), 0.5 μl of SUPERase·In (Promega, N2511), 2.0 μl of EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer, NEG072002MC) containing [35S]Met and [35S]Cys, and 2 μl of ER microsomes (prepared as described previously (28.Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. The organizing principle in the formation of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex.Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar)). Total mRNA concentrations were generally kept below 250 ng/reaction but varied depending on efficiency of translation as determined by test translation experiments. mRNA was denatured at 65 °C for 3 min prior to addition to lysate mixtures. mRNA was translated for 15–30 min at 30 °C, and then oxidized glutathione was added to a final concentration of 4 mm. Assembly proceeded in oxidizing conditions for 2 h (three chain experiments) or 4 h (five chain experiments). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 900 μl of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline containing 10 mm iodoacetamide. ER microsomes were pelleted at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were washed with an additional 500 μl to Tris-buffered saline containing 10 mm iodoacetamide. After discarding the wash, ER microsome pellets were extracted in 0.5% digitonin, 200 μg/ml BSA, 10 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at 4 °C. For experiments involving anti-PC pulldown, 2 mm CaCl2 was included in the extraction buffer. Mixing controls were performed by translating and oxidizing certain mRNAs (detailed in the figure legends) in separate, half-volume in vitro translation reactions and mixing after reactions were stopped with ice-cold buffer. Digitonin extracts were passed through Spin-X filters (Corning, 8160) to remove insoluble material, and 10–15 μl of the appropriate affinity bead slurry was added to immunoprecipitate polypeptides of interest. Immunoprecipitations were incubated between 2 and 24 h before being washed. For nondenaturing elution, SBP pulldowns were eluted with 100 μm biotin in 0.5% digitonin containing 200 μg/ml BSA in Tris-buffered saline before being transferred to anti-HA-agarose for sequential immunoprecipitation. When nondenaturing elution was not required, samples were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 3 min in 10 μl of 0.5% SDS in 50 mm citrate, pH 5.6. Eluted complexes were incubated at 37 °C after the addition of 0.5 μl of endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, P0702) to remove sugar moieties. Deglycosylated chains were separated by 12% NuPAGE (Invitrogen, NP0341 or NP0343) in MES buffer (Invitrogen, NP0002) and blotted onto PVDF (Millipore, ISQ00010). To measure incorporated [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, PVDF membranes were placed on storage phosphor screens (BAS IP TR2040) and scanned by a Typhoon (GE Healthcare, FLA-9410). The gel files were converted to tiff format, and densitometry was performed using Image Gauge V4 software (Fujifilm). Data were plotted using Prism V5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). For NMR structural studies we expressed, refolded, and purified a single-chain construct comprising the extracellular Ig domains of ch-CD3ϵ and ch-CD3δ/γ joined via a 26-amino acid flexible linker. Of the 178 residues present, backbone amide assignments could be made for all CD3ϵ residues with the exception of Gly13, and all CD3δ/γ residues except Ser27–Asn33 and His75–His77 (excluding the linker sequence). Approximately 85% of other nonlabile side-chain resonances were assigned (Table 1). A second set of resonances could be observed for CD3ϵ residues Ile11, Ser12, Thr17, Ile18, Thr19, Ser22, Trp29, Ile42, Asn43, His46, Asp47, Ser49, Ser54, Cys55, and His62, suggesting the presence of two conformations of CD3ϵ in slow exchange on the NMR timescale. Only the resonances of the major conformer (which represented 71% of total protein) were used for structure determination.TABLE 1NMR and refinement statistics for the 10 Ch-CD3ϵδ/γ model structuresNonredundant NOE distance restraints Total1784 Intra (i = j)315 Sequential (|i − j| = 1)547 Short (1 < |i − j| ≤ 5)291 Long (|i − j| > 5)631Dihedral angle restraints158Hydrogen bond restraints (2 per bond)68Deviations from experimental data NOEs (Å)0.016 ± 0.001 Dihedrals (°)0.692 ± 0.071Deviations from ideal geometry Bonds (Å)0.0016 ± 0.0001 Angles (°)0.327 ± 0.006 Impropers (°)0.211 ± 0.012Pairwise root mean standard deviation (Å) (residues 9–73,108–123,132–174) Backbone atoms0.69 ± 0.10 Heavy atoms1.29 ± 0.10Ramachandran statistics Residues in most favored regions68.7% Residues in additional allowed regions25.4% Residues in generously allowed regions5.0% Residues in disallowed regions0.9% Open table in a new tab The ch-CD3ϵ monomer forms an Ig domain comprising seven β-strands making up two antiparallel β-sheets (sheet 1, ABED, and sheet 2, CFG) that pack via a hydrophobic core and are bridged by a disulfide bond originating from two conserved cysteine residues (Cys20 and Cys55) (Fig. 1, A and B). Accordingly, ch-CD3ϵ belongs to the C1-set Ig fold but is atypical in that, like the CH1 antibody domains, it lacks the short C′ strand in sheet 2 (39.Harpaz Y. Chothia C. Many of the immunoglobulin superfamily domains in cell adhesion molecules and surface receptors belong to a new structural set which is close to that containing variable domains.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to both mouse and human CD3ϵ, which contain seven and eight β-strands and fall into the C2 and I-set Ig folds, respectively (20.Kjer-Nielsen L. Dunstone M.A. Kostenko L. Ely L.K.

https://openalex.org/W2058586520,"Purpose Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is defined by a perturbed B-cell receptor-mediated signaling machinery. We aimed to model differential signaling behavior between B cells from CLL and healthy individuals to pinpoint modes of dysregulation. Experimental Design We developed an experimental methodology combining immunophenotyping, multiplexed phosphospecific flow cytometry, and multifactorial statistical modeling. Utilizing patterns of signaling network covariance, we modeled BCR signaling in 67 CLL patients using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Results from multidimensional modeling were validated using an independent test cohort of 38 patients. Results We identified a dynamic and variable imbalance between proximal (pSYK, pBTK) and distal (pPLCγ2, pBLNK, ppERK) phosphoresponses. PLSR identified the relationship between upstream tyrosine kinase SYK and its target, PLCγ2, as maximally predictive and sufficient to distinguish CLL from healthy samples, pointing to this juncture in the signaling pathway as a hallmark of CLL B cells. Specific BCR pathway signaling signatures that correlate with the disease and its degree of aggressiveness were identified. Heterogeneity in the PLSR response variable within the B cell population is both a characteristic mark of healthy samples and predictive of disease aggressiveness. Conclusion Single-cell multidimensional analysis of BCR signaling permitted focused analysis of the variability and heterogeneity of signaling behavior from patient-to-patient, and from cell-to-cell. Disruption of the pSYK/pPLCγ2 relationship is uncovered as a robust hallmark of CLL B cell signaling behavior. Together, these observations implicate novel elements of the BCR signal transduction as potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2103981572,"Like urban heat islands (UHI), human-induced land degradation (HLD) is a phenomenon attributed to human activities, but this phenomenon occurs in non-urban areas. Although a large body of work has demonstrated that land-cover change influences local climate systems, little work has been done on separating the impact of HLD from naturally-occurring fluctuations in very high-altitude areas. We developed an innovative NDVI-difference method in order to evaluate HLD effects upon the climate system in the central Tibet Plateau. The results show that the minimum temperature increased at a significantly faster pace than the maximum temperature in the growing season at HLD meteorological stations, but this was reversed at stations with natural forces only. Further analysis revealed that abrupt changes of minimum temperature occurred five years earlier and amplitudes of these changes were 1.4 times larger than at stations with natural forces only. Therefore, our results complement other evidence that points to the fact that local effects from UHI contribute to climatic asymmetry observed between minimum and maximum temperature trends. Accordingly, we stress the need for consideration of non-urban factors from anthropogenic activities, such as human-induced land degradation, in understanding these asymmetric diurnal changes."
https://openalex.org/W1974606395,"Many of the current antitumor therapeutic strategies are based on the perturbation of the cell cycle, especially during mitosis. Antimitotic drugs trigger mitotic checkpoint activation, mitotic arrest and eventually cell death. However, mitotic slippage represents a major mechanism of resistance to these treatments. In an attempt to circumvent the process of slippage, targeting mitotic exit has been proposed as a better strategy to kill tumor cells. In this study, we show that treatments that induce mitotic checkpoint activation and mitotic arrest downregulate FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) levels and sensitize several tumor cell lines to TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that in absence of mitotic checkpoint activation, mitotic arrest induced either by Cdc20 knockdown or overexpression of nondegradable cyclin B is sufficient to induce both FLIP downregulation and sensitivity to TRAIL. In summary, our data suggest that a combination of antimitotic drugs targeting cyclin B degradation and TRAIL might prevent mitotic slippage and allow tumor cells to reach the threshold for apoptosis induction, thereby facilitating tumor suppression."
