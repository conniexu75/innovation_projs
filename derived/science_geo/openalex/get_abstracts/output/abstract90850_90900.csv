https://openalex.org/W2077034296,"The incubation of lens proteins with reducing sugars leads to the formation of fluorescent yellow pigments and cross-like similar to those reported in aging and cataractous human lenses. Called nonenzymatic browning or the Maillard reaction, this aging process also occurs in stored foods. Reducing sugars condense with the free amino group of proteins, then rearrange and dehydrate to form unsaturated pigments and cross-linked products. Although most proteins in living systems turn over with sufficient rapidity to avoid nonenzymatic browning, some, such as lens crystallins and skin collagen, are exceptionally long-lived and may be vulnerable."
https://openalex.org/W2003821834,"The pH of the cytoplasm (pHt) measured with pH-sensitive microelectrodes in cleavage-stage blastomeres of amphibian (Ambystoma) and teleost (Fundulus) embryos is about 7.7. In electrotonically coupled cell pairs, junctional conductance is rapidly and reversibly reduced by acidification of the cytoplasm. The relation between junctional conductance and pHi is the same for increasing and decreasing pH and is independent of the rate of change over a wide range. The relation is well fitted by a Hill curve with K = 50 nM (pK = 7.3) and n = 4 to 5. The closure of gap junction channels at low pHi appears to be a cooperative process involving several charged sites. The absence of hysteresis and identity of effects for fast and slow pHi changes implies that protons act directly on the channel macromolecules and not through an intermediate in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2055124007,"In response to elevated temperature, Drosophila cells synthesize a small set of proteins known as the heat-shock proteins, while synthesis of most other proteins ceases. In vitro translation has been used to demonstrate that the messenger RNAs encoding the normal (25 degrees) spectrum of proteins are not broken down or irreversibly inactivated in response to the temperature change. During the heat shock only the heat-shock mRNAs plus a small number of preexisting mRNAs are translated, while most other messages are stored and can be reactivated upon return of the cells to their normal temperature. After recovery from heat shock, cells translate both the normal mRNA and the remaining heat-shock mRNA. The translational control operating in intact cells has been reproduced in cell-free translation systems directed by purified mRNA from normal and heat-shocked cells. Lysates prepared from heat-shocked Drosophila cells preferentially translated the heat-shock messages, while the lysate made from normally growing Drosophila cells indiscriminately translated both normal and heat-shock messages. Therefore there must be stable alterations in the translational components of heat-shocked cells which are capable of causing selective translation of the heat-shock messages. In addition there must be information encoded in the heat-shock messages that allows their selection."
https://openalex.org/W2059897736,"Immunoglobulin class switch involves a unique recombination event that takes place at the region 5' to each heavy chain constant region gene during B lymphocyte differentiation. Such regions that are responsible for the class-switch recombination are defined as S regions (Kataoka et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 919, 1980). We have cloned a rearranged gamma 2b gene from a mouse myeloma (MPC11) and compared its structure with the germ line counterparts. The rearranged gamma 2b gene contained the 5' flanking region of the gamma 3 gene (S gamma 3 region) which are linked to the 5' flanking region of the gamma 2b gene (S gamma 2b region). We have determined nucleotide sequences surrounding the recombination site of the rearranged and germ line gamma 2b genes, which include the S gamma 2b and S gamma 3 regions. Both gamma 2b and S gamma 3 regions comprise tandem repetition of conserved units of 49 bp. Similar 49 bp repeating units are also found in the previously determined sequence of the S gamma 1 region in which class-switch recombination took place in MC101 myeloma. The nucleotide sequences of the S gamma 1, S gamma 2b and S gamma 3 repeating units share significant homology with each other. The S mu region, partial nucleotide sequence of which was previously determined, contains abundant short sequences such as AGCT, TGGG and AGCTGGGG which are shared in common by repeating sequences in S gamma regions. These results suggest that the recombination responsible for class switch from mu to gamma or from a gamma to another gamma, may be facilitated directly or indirectly by homology of repeating sequences in S regions."

https://openalex.org/W1568858788,"Treatment of human platelets with alpha-thrombin leads to the selective hydrolysis of only one membrane protein, glycoprotein V. To determine whether glycoprotein V was directly cleaved by alpha-thrombin and to permit further characterization of this glycoprotein as the potential functional thrombin receptor, glycoprotein V was purified to > 98% homogeneity. Washed platelets were prepared from concentrates within 18 h of venipuncture, since clinically expired platelets (> 72 h from venipuncture) were shown to contain little or no detectable glycoprotein V. Glycoprotein V was eluted from the platelet membrane by equilibrating the platelets (4 X 10(9)/ml) at 37 degrees C for 24 h in 0.01 M 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (Hepes), pH 7.6 (1 mM in EDTA, 0.3 M in NaCl). Purification was achieved by initially performing ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, hydroxylapatite, and DEAE- and CM-cellulose, and yielded 0.5 to 1.0 mg of purified glycoprotein per 100 units of platelet concentrate (approximately 6 X 10(12) platelets). Purified glycoprotein V (Mr = 82,000) was a thrombin substrate, and on hydrolysis yielded a major fragment, GPVf1 (Mr = 69,500), identical in molecular weight with that observed previously in the supernatant of thrombin-treated, periodate-labeled platelets. Glycoprotein V existed as at least eight distinct isoelectric forms with pI values ranging from 5.85 +/- 0.05 to 6.55 +/- 0.05. The purified glycoprotein contained approximately 48% carbohydrate by weight, consisting of neutral hexose, hexosamine, and sialic acid in a molar ratio of approximately 8:2:1. Rabbit antiglycoprotein V antibody gave a single precipitin line against purified glycoprotein V, which showed a line of complete identity with Triton-solubilized washed platelets. The availability of purified glycoprotein V and antiglycoprotein V antibody will be useful in delineating the role of this glycoprotein in thrombin activation of platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1509046973,"This paper is concerned with the control of glycolysis in nongrowing Streptococcus lactis 7962. Changes were measured in the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi), and adenine nucleotides following addition of glucose to cells that were in a starved condition. We find that intracellular Pi is a major factor in the control of glycolysis. In starved cells, the intracellular Pi concentration is high, greater than 40 mM. The large phosphoenolpyruvate pool that exists in starved cells can be explained as a result of inhibition of pyruvate kinase by the high concentration of Pi. On the other hand, in cells that are metabolizing glucose at a steady state rate, the cellular Pi concentration is low and pyruvate kinase is active. Upon depletion of glucose from the medium, the metabolite concentrations return to the values originally found in the starved state. This glucose depletion raises the intracellular Pi which again leads to inhibition of pyruvate kinase and the consequent buildup of the P-enolpyruvate pool."
https://openalex.org/W1982165777,"We have used cloned chicken cDNA sequences for α- and β-tubulin to investigate tubulin gene organization in Drosophila melanogaster. Experiments using genomic Drosophila DNA from several sources indicate that there are at least four copies each of the α-tubulin gene and the β-tubulin gene. In situ hybridization experiments show that both the α- and β-tubulin multigene families have dispersed arrangements on the chromosome. Genes for α-tubulin have been localized at chromosomal bands 67C, 84B/C, 84D and 85E, while genes for β-tubulin have been detected at bands 60A/B and 85D. α-Tubulin and β-tubulin chicken cDNA sequences can be used to select a specific mRNA species from a complex mixture which translates in vitro into α- or β-tubulin protein. RNA blot hybridization using the cloned chicken cDNA sequences as probes shows that the α- and β-tubulin messages detected are clearly different in length, with the message for α-tubulin measuring approximately 2000 bases and the message for β-tubulin containing approximately 1800 bases."

https://openalex.org/W1578737142,"The malK gene product of Escherichia coli has been identified through the use of a previously described technique that employs gene fusions (Shuman, H. A., Silhavy, T. J., and Beckwith, J. R. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 168-174). This protein, along with the four other products of the malB locus, comprise the complete maltose transport system. The malK protein has a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 and is located in the cell envelope. In mutant strains which lack another component of the transport system, the malG protein, the malK protein is located in the cytoplasm. This alteration in location suggests that the malK protein is associated with the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane via an interaction with the malG protein."

https://openalex.org/W1988878935,A strain of Bacillus megaterium isolated from soil has been found to oxidize elemental selenium in laboratory cultures to selenite and a trace of selenate (< 1 percent of the selenite). This observation represents an important but hitherto unreported oxidative step in the biological selenium cycle.
https://openalex.org/W1505065366,"The processing of [3H]proline-labeled procollagen III in excised chick embryo blood vessels was found to differ significantly from that of procollagen I in the same tissue. While first the amino propeptides and then the carboxyl propeptides were fairly rapidly cleaved from procollagen I, only the carboxyl propeptides were split off procollagen III, leaving pN-collagen III. This intermediate, which is only slowly converted to collagen III by loss of amino propeptides, was characterized by its sedimentation properties, isolation of the amino propeptide, and reaction with purified antibodies that are specific against bovine amino propeptide III. It is interchain disulfide-linked, both through the amino propeptide and the carboxyl ends of the collagen chains. The conversion of procollagen III to pN-collagen III either in blood vessels, or after isolation by a carboxyl procollagen peptidase obtained from chick tendon fibroblast cultures, is inhibited by 50 mM arginine. Underhydroxylated procollagen III was isolated from blood vessels treated with alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl. Its amino propeptides reacted with the above antibodies but were not linked to each other. In contrast, its carboxyl propeptides were interchain disulfide-bridged, supporting previous suggestions that the carboxyl propeptides play a role in the assembly of procollagen trimer."
https://openalex.org/W2069293350,"Folate binding proteins in milk were tested for their effect on folate absorption. The uptake of bound folate by isolated mucosal cells from the rat small intestine was twice that of free folate and differed from it in being more effective with progression down the small intestine, in not being affected by glucose or Dilantin, in having a higher pH optimum, and in being affected by calcium concentration. This milk factor may enhance folate absorption in infants, whose risk of folate deficiency is high."
https://openalex.org/W1484027641,"L-Threonine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of L-threonine to aminoacetone + CO2 presumably via the intermediate formation of alpha-amino-beta-ketobutyrate, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from extracts of a mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 which has constitutively derepressed levels of the enzyme. Three fractionation steps were used including controlled heat denaturation, DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, and blue dextran-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme migrated as a single band, coincident with dehydrogenase activity, when electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels at pH 8.0 and 9.5. Electrophoresis in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate also showed one band and a single schlieren peak was seen during sedimentation velocity centrifugation. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 140,000 +/- 4,000 as determined by sucrose density and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. Based on electrophoresis in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation in 6 M guanidine.HCl, and cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate, the molecule is a tetramer consisting of identical (or nearly identical) subunits with Mr approximately equal to 35,000. L-Threonine dehydrogenase is specific for NAD+ or NAD+ analogs and utilizes L-threonine, D-allothreonine, or L-threonine amide as the best substrates. In 50 mM Tris.HCl buffer (pH 8.4) and 37 degrees C, the Km values for L-threonine and NAD+ are 1.43 and 0.19 mM, respectively. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 10.3, is activated by Mn2+, and shows a substantial loss of activity when treated with certain sulfhydryl-reacting reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2046869115,"In the Drosophila melanogaster cell line Kc-H, ecdysteroid hormone treatment causes increased relative synthesis of three ecdysteroid-inducible polypeptides (EIPs), named according to their molecular weights (in kilodaltons) EIP 40, EIP 29 and EIP 28. Increased synthesis of the EIPs is detectable within 45 min (EIP 28) or 75 min (EIPs 40 and 29), is maximal at 4-8 hr and continues for almost 2 days. During this period no other major changes in protein synthesis are discernible using one-dimensional gels. At maximum, EIP 28 synthesis is elevated at least 10 fold above its basal level, and EIPs 40 and 29 somewhat less. EIP induction is ecdysteroid-specific and is detectable in the presence of 10(-8) M 20-hydroxyecdysone. It does not occur in hormone-resistant cells. Apparently identical polypeptides are inducible in another ecdysteroid-responsive cell line, Schneider's line 3. Because EIP synthesis is an early and substantial response to ecdysteroids, this is a promising system for the study of steroid hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W1982473206,"The addition of physiological concentrations of the arthropod molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone results in the cessation of cell division in the Kc cell line of Drosophila melanogaster. Fluorometric mononitoring of the cell cycle reveals that treatment of the cells with hormone for 12 hr causes a G2 arrest. The dose-response curves are in agreement with those obtained for other hormonal effects in both the Kc line and the intact animal. In the continual presence of hormone, cells remain G2-arrested for approximately 100 hr, resuming division by 120 hr. Cells which have responded once to ecdysteroids and subsequently reentered the cell cycle are insensitive to hormonal restimulation. This lack of response has been correlated with, and is probably due to, the loss of ecdysteroid receptors in stimulated cells."

https://openalex.org/W1494464474,"5,8,11-Eicosatrienoic acid was converted by mouse mastocytoma cells stimulated with ionophore A23187 to two slow reacting substances. These were characterized by spectroscopy and by chemical and enzymatic degradations as two geometrical isomers of 5-hydroxy-6-S-glutathionyl-7,9,11-eicosatrienoic acid (E,E,Z; leukotriene C3 and E,E,E; 11-trans-leukotriene C3). Corresponding cysteinylglycine compounds (leukotriene D3 and 11-trans leukotriene D3) were obtained from the leukotriene C3 isomers by treatment with kidney gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The biological effects of leukotrienes C3 and D3, on the isolated guinea pig ileum, were approximately the same as of leukotrienes derived from arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2036744348,"During B cell differentiation to pentamer IgM secretion, synthesis of the pentamer joining component, the J chain, is initiated. We investigated the mechanism for initiating J chain synthesis by analyzing murine cell lines representing different stages in B cell differentiation. The expression of functional J chain mRNA was evaluated by cell-free translation and specific immunoprecipitation of a J chain product. The expression of precursor mRNA was examined by hybridization with a J chain probe obtained by molecular cloning of cDNA. No J chain-specific RNA could be demonstrated in a lymphoma line representative of an undifferentiated B lymphocyte, but three species of J chain RNA were identified in hybrid cell lines representative of IgM-secreting plasma cells: a mature message of approximately 1.5 kb and two minor components of 2.5 and 0.92 kb. The encounter of a B cell with antigen or mitogen must therefore trigger events that effect either transcription of J chain sequences or their intranuclear stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W1596763883,"The mechanism by which gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) inhibits ovarian progesterone production was investigated by studying the GnRH modulation of 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in cultured rat granulosa cells. The granulosa cells obtained from hypophysectomized, estrogen-treated rats were treated with various hormones in vitro and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity determined by measuring the conversion of radiolabeled 20 alpha-hydroxy-pregn-4-en-3-one to progesterone. Treatment with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) increased the 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity of granulosa cells to 1.3-fold of the control value. Concomitant treatment with 10(-8) M GnRH further enhanced the FSH stimulation of enzyme activity to 2.6-fold of the control value. The increases in 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity were associated with increases in maximum velocity, while the Km values remained unchanged. In contrast, prolactin (PRL) treatment of FSH-primed granulosa cells resulted in an 88% decrease in 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity as compared to untreated controls. Concomitant treatment with GnRH partially blocked this inhibitory effect. Furthermore, incubation of granulosa cells for 2 days with GnRH alone resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, as compared to untreated controls. In all experiments, the effect of GnRH was blocked by concomitant treatment with a GnRH antagonist. These results suggest that one mechanism by which GnRH inhibits FSH- and PRL-stimulated progesterone production in granulosa cells is through the stimulation of the activity of 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase which converts progesterone to a less active metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1503306791,"Multiple injections of nontoxic levels of cadmium to a rat result in much higher level of metallothionein (MT) production in the liver than does the single injection. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms we have quantitated and compared the metallothionein-specific messenger RNA contents in the livers following the two induction regimens. Cell-free translation assays coupled with specific immunoprecipitation of MT revealed that MT-mRNA activity in livers of animals multiply injected with Cd is 7- to 10-fold higher than that in livers 4 h after a single Cd-induction. By oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and methylmercuric hydroxide-agarose gel electrophoresis this mRNA has been enriched approximately 100-fold from the total RNA. The size of the mRNA is about 400 nucleotides. Hybridization assays with a complementary DNA probe synthesized against the enriched MT-mRNA showed a 4-fold difference in the level of MT-mRNA between the two induction regimens in agreement with the results obtained by the cell-free translation assays. The possible mechanisms for these observations in consideration of the short lived nature of MT-mRNA are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2036019308,"In an examination of the molecular basis of oral transmission of bunyaviruses by mosquitoes., La Crosse (LAC), snowshoe hare (SSH), and LAC-SSH reassortant viruses were compared in their ability to be transmitted to laboratory mice by the natural mosquito vector of LAC virus, Aedes triseriatus. Both LAC virus and the reassortment viruses containing the middle-sized (M) segment from the LAC parent were efficiently transmitted. In contrast, SSH virus and reassortment viruses containing the M RNA from the SSH parent were inefficiently transmitted. Thus, the M RNA segment, which codes for the virion glycoproteins, may be a major determinant of oral transmission of bunyaviruses by mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W1485625784,"Histidine decarboxylase from fetal rat liver was purified to near-homogeneity. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 210,000, and appears to contain two subunits with molecular weights of 145,000 and 66,000, respectively. The enzyme is inhibited by heavy metals such as Hg2+ and Zn2+ and sulfhydryl-reactive compounds such as 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. The enzyme is partially dependent on exogenous pyridoxal phosphate. Extensive dialysis results in 50% loss of enzyme activity which can be fully recovered by adding pyridoxal phosphate. Affinity of pyridoxal phosphate for the apoenzyme is 0.1 microM at pH 6.8. Antibody against purified histidine decarboxylase was raised in rabbits. The antibody has been employed in immunohistochemical studies to visualize histidine decarboxylase containing cells and neuronal processes in rat stomach and brain, respectively. Immunologic studies indicate that histidine decarboxylase from brain, gastric mucosa, and fetal rat liver share common antigenic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1507331058,"Gangliosides were isolated from purified preparations of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and neutrophils. Structural analyses and comparisons were performed by direct probe mass spectrometry and by degradation studies with the following enzymes: Escherichia freundii endo-beta-galactosidase; Clostridium perfringens and Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase; and jack bean beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase and beta-galactosidase. This combination of techniques allowed us to obtain carbohydrate composition and sequence information without the aid of methylation or carbohydrate compositional analyses using only 1-2 mg of purified gangliosides. On the basis of these studies we propose that human lymphocytes and neutrophils have gangliosides with the following structures. NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer Structure A NeuAc alpha 2 leads to ? GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer Structure B NeuAc alpha 2 leads to ? Gal beta 1 leads to 3,4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer Structure C All three compounds were isolated from both cell types with structure A being the major lymphocyte ganglioside and structure C the major neutrophil ganglioside. Structure B is a novel ganglioside and may represent a leukocyte-specific glycosphingolipid. Neuraminidase degradation studies demonstrated that only one ganglioside species of each cell type contains an internally linked sialic acid residue, and on the basis of thin layer chromatographic analysis this component is the same as the major brain ganglioside, GM1 (II3-N-acetylneuraminosyl-gangliotetraosylceramide). In addition, large gangliosides with the general structure NeuAc alpha 2 leads to ?(Gal beta 1 leads to 3,4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3)n Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer were isolated. These results are discussed as they relate to blood group antigens and specific cell surface markers in human leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1529699763,"The CO2 hydration and HCO3- dehydration activities of human red cell carbonic anhydrase isozymes B and C (HCAB and HCAC) have been studied as a function of temperature from 0 degrees to 37 degrees C. The Arrhenius plots of ln kcat versus 1/T are linear for both isozymes in both hydration and dehydration reactions, indicating that the rate-determining steps remain unchanged over this temperature range. The 37 degrees C hydration kcat, at pH 7.5, is 13 X 10(5) s-1 for isozyme C and 0.71 X 10(5) s-1 for isozyme B. Km, for hydration, is 10 mM for C and 5 mM for B, and invariant with temperature. The uncatalyzed reactions are significantly affected by temperature, 30- to 40-fold rate enhancements being observed from 0 degrees to 37 degrees C. The enzyme-catalyzed processes are much less sensitive to temperature, the rate enhancements being 2- to 3-fold for HCAB and 5- to 6-fold for HCAC in this temperature range. These observations are consistent with a significant lowering of the free energy of activation by both isozymes. This effect is greater for C accounting for its higher catalytic power. The enthalpy of activation, at pH 7.5 and 8.2, in the rate-limiting step is considerably less for the B enzyme compared to C. This is, however, more than offset by a large negative entropy of activation in the case of HCAB. This observation indicates either a mechanistic difference in the rate-limiting events or a difference in the structural organizations of the active sites of the two isozymes, or both."

https://openalex.org/W2044806831,"Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells accumulate high levels of plasminogen activator (PA) activity at confluency. This cell-associated PA (PAc) activity remains high when the cells are maintained without refeeding. Addition of fresh growth medium to these cultures results in a 70–80% decrease in this activity. The decrease is apparent within 30 min, is complete by 2 hr and is initiated by the fetal calf serum (FCS) in the medium. The decrease is transient, with PAc returning to control levels within 4 days, and occurs each time these confluent cultures are fed; it is not associated with the initiation of DNA synthesis. The magnitude of the decrease in PAc activity depends on the concentration of the added serum, with 0.1% FCS causing a 50% decrease. Maximum suppression is observed with 1% FCS. The decrease in PAc activity is not due to serum-mediated stimulation of secretion since PA secretion is also suppressed by fresh serum. Neither changes in the activity of cellular inhibitors nor the presence of contaminating serum inhibitors appears to account for the observed loss of activity. The suppressor activity of serum is nondialyzable but heat-labile. Treatment of serum with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) or hirudin does not reduce its suppressor activity, suggesting that neither thrombin nor other serine proteases are involved. This PA-suppressor activity is not a unique property of FCS since sera from other species, as well as bovine platelet-poor plasma (PPP), are effective in reducing PAc activity. These observations indicate that the fibrinolytic activity of cultured endothelial cells is modified by routine culture manipulations and suggest that production of PA by the endothelium itself may be subject to negative regulation by suppressor molecules in the blood."
https://openalex.org/W2070442947,"An infectious virus isolated from the cultured Drosophila melanogster cell line, Schneider 2-L, appears to be a member of a new group of animal viruses. The virus, HPS-1 has a genome composed of a single segment of double-stranded RNA approximately 6 kb in length. Virions are particles approximately 36 nm in diameter. They contain only two proteins and no lipid coat. The major protein, presumably the viral coat protein, is 120,000 daltons. A 200,000 dalton protein is present in much lower quantities. Two other proteins, synthesized in virus-producing cells, are encoded in the viral genome but not included in the mature virion. Synthesis of viral proteins is not affected by the heat-shock-induced translational control that inhibits translation of most normal mRNAs but allows protein synthesis on heat-shock mRNAs. The viral mRNAs thus appear to share the structural features of heat-shock mRNAs which permit heir translation in heat-shocked cells. Viral RNA serves as a probe to study heat-shock translational control. Cells heat-shocked in the presence of actinomycin D cannot transcribe heat-shock mRNA and therefore cannot make heat-shock proteins. Although these cells are making neither heat-shock mRNA nor heat-shock protein, the translational control appears fully induced. The normal cell proteins are not made in these cells but viral proteins are synthesized. These results indicate that the heat shock-induced proteins are not components of the translational control mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1512894213,"Analysis of nascent heavy chains isolated from MPC11 (gamma 2b heavy chains) and MOPC 21 (gamma 1 heavy chains) mouse myeloma cells demonstrates an accumulation of nascent heavy chains which are slightly smaller in mass (approximately 35,000 daltons) than nascent heavy chains which have just been glycosylated (approximately 38,000 daltons). The accumulation of 35,000-dalton nascent heavy chain appears to be a consequence of the glycosylation process since tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation, abolishes the apparent translational block manifested by the accumulation of 35,000-dalton nascent chains. Tunicamycin also causes a 15 to 25% increase n the relative rate of synthesis of heavy chain compared to the corresponding rate of synthesis of the nonglycosylated light chain synthesized by the same cell. These results suggest that the translation block, caused by the glycosylation process, of heavy chain synthesis contributes to the imbalance of heavy chain and light chain biosynthesis observed in malignant and normal lymphoid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1548187259,"Human glucose phosphate isomerase was subjected to a series of chemical modifications aimed at identifying residues essential for catalytic activity. A specific lysine was found to stoichiometrically react with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate forming a reversible Schiff base which could be reduced with NaBH4. The covalently modified enzyme was specifically cleaved with hydroxylamine at three labile Asn-Gly sequences yielding a series of peptides which were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The modified lysine was located in the COOH-terminal peptide. A critical arginine residue/subunit was found to be stoichiometrically modified with either 2,3-butadione or cyclohexadione. At high concentrations of butadione, an irreversible nonspecific modification of essentially all arginines occurred. An essential tryptophan residue was found to be stoichiometrically modified with N-bromosuccinimide in a similar fashion. Each of the chemical modifications of these three residues followed pseudo-first order and rate saturation kinetics and the modifications were prevented by the presence of substrates or competitive inhibitors. Circular dichroic spectral studies and analytical gel filtration indicated that these modifications have no effect on the quarternary structure and little effect on the secondary and tertiary structures of the enzyme. However, the extensive modification of arginine with butadione caused a dissociation of the enzyme into monomers and significant changes in tertiary structure. These studies provide new insights into functional aspects of isomerization and also provide an effective method for evaluating structural consequences of chemical or genetic modification of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1564816350,"Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) particles of different sizes were prepared by a short sonication of the lipid followed by fractionation on a Sepharose CL-4B column. Column fractions were pooled to give DMPC multilamellar liposomes, and vesicles ranging in average diameters from 300 to 220 A. These particles were used to prepare complexes with bovine apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I). Reaction mixtures covering molar ratios from 2000:1 to 100:1 DMPC/apo A-I were equilibrated at 25 degrees C for over 15 h and were fractionated by gel filtration in order to separate vesicular and micellar protein.lipid complexes. The results indicate that under identical reaction conditions, larger particles with a smaller total surface area per mol of lipid give proportionately more micellar complexes. In fact, the multilamellar liposomes give only micellar complexes at all the initial molar ratios. For the smaller DMPC vesicles, the vesicular complexes are saturated when 6 or 7 apo A-I molecules are bound per particle, which corresponds to 2,83 X 10(4) A2 of vesicle surface per apo A-I and an approximate 16% coverage of the surface by apo A-I."
https://openalex.org/W1567089653,"The chemical modification of lysine residues in human alpha-thrombin has been used to study the interaction of thrombin with human platelets. Phosphopyridoxylation of thrombin using pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (pyridoxal-P) has been shown to inhibit the fibrinogen clotting activity of thrombin but not the catalytic activity (Griffith, M. J. J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3401-3406). Phosphopyridoxylation resulted in marked inhibition of the platelet-activating activity of thrombin. The concentration of pyridoxal-P-thrombin required to induce half-maximal platelet aggregation and release was 60 times greater than that of unmodified thrombin. Binding studies using pyridoxal-P-125I-thrombin showed a loss of both high and low affinity binding of thrombin to the surface of intact gel filtered platelets. In contrast, thrombin modified with pyridoxal-P in the presence of heparin incorporated up to 1 mol of pyridoxal-P per mol of thrombin. The heparin-protected pyridoxal-P-thrombin was only slightly inhibited in its interaction with platelets, and binding studies with the heparin-protected pyridoxal-P-125I-thrombin showed selective loss of low affinity binding but preservation of high affinity binding. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that residues at the macromolecular binding site of thrombin are involved in the binding of thrombin to platelets and further separate this functional region of thrombin into two lysine-containing subregions, one which is protected from modification by heparin which is involved in high affinity binding, and another which is not protected by heparin which is involved in low affinity binding."

https://openalex.org/W1532321677,"Kinetic alpha-deuterium isotope effects have been measured for the purine nucleoside phosphorylase-catalyzed phosphorolysis of adenosine and inosine by a competitive double label technique at saturating concentrations of the second substrate, phosphate. Under these conditions the observed isotope effect, kH/kD, is on the second order rate constant, Vmax/Km, for reaction of nucleoside with the Michaelis complex of enzyme and phosphate. For adenosine, at neutral pH, the isotope effect is unity. For inosine, kH/kD was determined as a function of pH (the numbers in parentheses are the ratios of Vmax at that pH to Vmax at pH 7.3): 1.10 at pH 5.0 (0.19); 1.10 at pH 6.1 (0.72); 1.01 at pH 7.3 (1.00); 1.16 at pH 8.4 (0.22); and 1.18 at pH 9.4 (0.04). These values suggest a mechanism for purine nucleoside phosphorylase involving a change in rate-limiting step from one at pH values near neutrality for which cleavage of the nucleoside C-N bond is not rate limiting to a step at extremes of pH with a transition state having considerable oxocarbonium ion-like character."
https://openalex.org/W1551984141,"To understand the catalytic mechanism of glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1), pyridoxal(5‘)phospho(1)-beta-D-glucose was synthesized and examined as a hypothetical intermediate in the catalysis. Pyridoxal phosphoglucose bound stoichiometrically to the cofactor site of rabbit muscle phosphorylase b in a similar mode of binding to the natural cofactor, pyridoxal 5‘-phosphate. The rate of binding of pyridoxal phosphoglucose was only 1/100 compared with that of pyridoxal phosphate. The enzyme reconstituted with pyridoxal phosphoglucose showed no enzymatic activity at all even after prolonged incubation of the enzyme with substrates and activator. The present data would contradict participation of the phosphate group of pyridoxal phosphate in a covalent glucosyl-enzyme intermediate even if the covalent intermediate was formed during the catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1669912892,"Cells having a fibroblast-like morphology were cultured from explants of adult rat lung tissue. (35S)Sulfate was incorporated into sulfated proteoglycans in the medium at a linear rate for up to 96 h, while the rate of incorporation into the cell layer increased gradually until reaching a plateau at 40 h. The culture medium contained proteoglycans which migrated as a single peak with Kav = 0.10 on Bio-Gel A-15. Their glycosaminoglycan components (Kav = 0.70 on Bio-Gel A-15) contained predominantly chondroitin sulfate (33 to 44% of the total galactosaminoglycans) or dermatan sulfate chains. Based on the results of chondroitinase AC-II and periodate degradation, disaccharide repeating units of the dermatan sulfate were composed of 36% iduronic acid, 50% 2-sulfoiduronate, and 14% glucuronic acid. A similar composition was found for the dermatan sulfate in the cell fraction. Almost one-half of the sulfate label in the cell fraction was in a heparan sulfate proteoglycan which migrated on Bio-Gel A-15 with Kav = 0.30. The heparan sulfate chains (Kav = 0.81 on Bio-Gel A-15) had few, if any, sulfated N-acetylglucosamine residues and did not contain 2-sulfoiduronic acid in neighboring disaccharide repeat sequences. These results indicate that fibroblast-like lung cells synthesize several types of multichain sulfated proteoglycans which have properties in common with those found in lung tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1549486095,"The proteolytic degradation by alpha-chymotrypsin of normal and variant human carbonic anhydrase isozymes (CA I and CA II) was investigated by measuring the release of the bound azosulfonamide inhibitor, Neoprontosil, from the active sites of these isozymes. The enzymes studied were the normal isozymes, CA I and CA II, a secondary isozyme of CA I, designated CA I (+1), the CA I variants CA I London (102 Glu leads to Lys), CA I Michigan-2 (100 Thr leads to Lys), and the CA II variant CA II2 (251 Asn leads to Asp). The CA I and CA II isozymes and their respective variants could be classified by their apparent Km values, which were about 40 and 180 microM, respectively. A substrate specificity for alpha-chymotrypsin degradation was given by the ratio kcat/Km, and showed that the specificity decreased such that CA I (+1) > CA I congruent to CA I London congruent to CA I Michigan-2 > CA II2 congruent to CA II. A comparison of the proteolytic data with those previously obtained from thermal inactivation studies of the same isozymes showed agreement in the order of stability to both degradative methods."
https://openalex.org/W1519538041,"Two leucine tRNAs from the cyanophyte Anacystis nidulans have been isolated, and their complete nucleotide sequences have been determined by combining data from oligonucleotide fingerprints and sequencing gels. The two sequences are 87 nucleotides long, have the anticodons CAA and CAG, and differ from each other at a total of 28 positions. They have been compared to other known tRNA Leu sequences and incorporated into a phylogenetic tree comprising prokaryotic and chloroplastic tRNA Leu sequences. Mutations inferred from the tree show that some parts of the tRNA molecule are highly variable (the extra arm and the acceptor stem) while others are much more conserved (the D and T arms). The topology of the tree supports the idea that blue-green algae and chloroplasts share a common prokaryotic ancestor and show a basic divergence between XAA and XAG anticodon-containing tRNAs, suggesting that these two subfamilies result from an ancient gene duplication. Finally, comparison of this phylogenetic tree with those of other multi-isoacceptor tRNA families shows no common scheme, which may be due to independent refinement of codon-reading patterns in different tRNA families."
https://openalex.org/W1579526499,"The mRNA coding for epsilon-heavy chain and kappa-light chain have been highly enriched from a rat IgE-producing myeloma, IR-162. Based on denaturing gel analyses, the 20 S epsilon-heavy chain mRNA has an estimated molecular weight of 850,000, equivalent to about 2500 nucleotides. The 14S rat kappa-light chain mRNA has an estimated molecular weight of 410,000, equivalent to about 1200 nucleotides. Only about two-thirds of the length of these mature cytoplasmic rat mRNA code for protein. The 20 S mRNA stimulates the in vitro synthesis of a single major serologically related protein which is large enough to be epsilon-heavy chain. It is unglycosylated and has an apparent molecular weight of about 62,000. The in vivo unglycosylated epsilon-heavy chain, obtained in the presence of tunicamycin, has an apparent molecular weight of about 59,000, compared with about 76,000 for the glycosylated heavy chain of the secreted rat IgE. Therefore, the in vitro synthesized epsilon-heavy chain protein is about Mr = 3000 larger than the in vivo unglycosylated epsilon-heavy chain, equivalent to about 25 extra amino acids. This is consistent with the synthesis of an epsilon-heavy chain putative precursor. Likewise, the 14 S mRNA stimulates the in vitro synthesis of a single putative precursor protein, which is serologically related to kappa chain, is unglycosylated, and is about an extra 20 amino acids. This is the first report on the physical and biological properties of an epsilon-heavy chain mRNA, as well as any rat immunoglobulin mRNA."
