The strategy of cloning was based on the functional similarities between H2O2 generation in leukocytes and the thyroid, according to the hypothesis that one of the components of the thyroid system would belong to the gp91Phox/Mox1 gene family and display sequence similarities with gp91Phox. Screening at low stringency with a gp91Phox probe of cDNA libraries from thyroid cells in primary culture yielded two distinct human cDNA clones harboring open reading frames of 1551 (ThOX1) and 1548 amino acids (ThOX2), respectively. The encoded polypeptides display 83% sequence similarity and are clearly related to gp91Phox (53 and 47% similarity). The theoretical molecular mass of 177 kDa is close to the apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa of the native corresponding porcine flavoprotein and the protein(s) detected by Western blot in dog and human thyroid. ThOX1 and ThOX2 display sequence similarities of 53% and 61%, respectively, with a predicted protein of Caenorhabditis elegans over their entire length. They show along their first 500 amino acids a similarity of 43% with thyroperoxidase. The corresponding genes of ThOX1 and ThOX2 are closely linked on chromosome 15q15.3. The dog mRNA expression is thyroid-specific and up-regulated by agents activating the cAMP pathway as is the synthesis of the polypeptides they are coding for. In human thyroid the positive regulation by cAMP is less pronounced. The proteins ThOX1 and ThOX2 accumulate at the apical membrane of thyrocytes and are co-localized with thyroperoxidase.

Iodide is oxidized to a higher oxidation state before it acts as an effective agent capable of iodinating thyroglobulin, the precursor of thyroid hormones (4Nunez J. Pommier J. Vitamin Horm. 1982; 39: 175-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Both the iodination of thyroglobulin and the oxidative coupling of the resulting iodotyrosines into iodothyronines take place in the follicular space in close contact with the apical pole of thyrocytes. According to current knowledge three different systems are co-localized within the apical plasma membrane and cooperate to the hormonogenic reaction: an iodide transporter, recently identified as the product of the pendrin gene (5Sheffield V.C.

H2O2 is the limiting factor in the oxidation of iodide in the synthesis of thyroid hormones reaction (9Corvilain B. Van Sande J. Laurent E. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). H2O2 is formed from the oxidation of NADPH by an NADPH oxidase, a flavoprotein that has been partially purified from solubilized pig thyroid plasma membrane (10Gorin Y. Ohayon R. Carvalho D.P. Dème D. Leseney A. Haye B. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Virion A. Dupuy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is known that the enzyme requires Ca2+ to be fully active, but the precise molecular structure of the H2O2 generating system operating in the thyroid remains ill defined. In polymorphonuclear neutrophils, an NADPH oxidase activity, with functional similarities to the thyroid system, is responsible for the burst of oxygen consumption (“respiratory burst”). It catalyzes the production of superoxide anions (O⨪2) in activated leukocytes. In these cells the molecular species implicated have been well defined; they comprise a glycoprotein, gp91Phox, and a smaller 22-kDa protein, p22Phox located at the membrane and at least three cytosolic components (p40Phox, p47Phox, and p67Phox) migrating to the membrane after stimulation of the cell (11Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In nonphagocytic mammal cells, Mox1 has been identified as another superoxide generating NADPH oxidase belonging to the same family as gp91Phox. It has been implicated in mitogenesis and cancer (12Suh Y. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). More recently NOH-1, generated from Mox1 transcripts by alternative splicing, has been described as a mammalian H+ channel (13Banfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). From the functional similarities between H2O2generation in leukocytes and the thyroid, we based a cloning strategy on the hypothesis that one of the components of the thyroid system would belong to the gp91Phox/Mox1 gene family and, accordingly, display sequence similarities with gp91Phox. Screening of cDNA libraries from thyroid cells in primary culture, at low stringency with a gp91Phox probe, yielded two distinct cDNA clones harboring open reading frames of 1551 (ThOX1) and 1548 amino acids (ThOX2), respectively. The encoded polypeptides display 83% sequence similarity and are clearly related to gp91Phox (53 and 47% similarity). The two corresponding genes are closely linked on chromosome 15q15.3. Their transcripts are thyroid-specific, subjected to positive regulation by cAMP agonists, and encode polypeptides accumulating at the apical membrane of thyrocytes. During the completion of the present study, Dupuy et al.(14Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noël-Hudson M. Dème D. Virion A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37265-37269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), using a strategy based on the purification of the enzymatic activity, reported cloning of a single cDNA encoding a 1210-residue thyroid NADPH oxidase. Comparison with the present results demonstrates that their p138Tox corresponds to a carboxyl fragment of ThOX2, lacking the first 338 residues. A λ ZapII cDNA library was constructed as described (15Wilkin F. Savonet V. Radulescu A. Petermans J. Dumont J.E. Maenhaut C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28451-28457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with poly(A)+ RNA prepared from human thyroid cells maintained in primary culture for 5 days with TSH.1 18 × 106 recombinant phages were screened at low stringency (hybridization at 42 °C: 30% formamide, 6× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% milk powder; washings at 50 °C: 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) with a 1.3-kilobasePstI-EcoRI fragment of gp91PhoxcDNA (a kind gift of Prof. S.Orkin). Two different 1.1-kilobase clones were obtained. Segments corresponding to their 5′ portions were used to screen 4 × 106 and 3 × 106 clones of λ gt11 cDNA libraries made from human (16Libert F. Ruel J. Ludgate M. Swillens S. Alexander N. Vassart G. Dinsart C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4193-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and dog (17Lefort A. Lecocq R. Libert F. Lamy F. Swillens S. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) thyroids, respectively. Segments containing the human counterparts of the canine coding sequences were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (ThOX1: forward 5′-GACGGAATTCATATTCATCATGGGCTTCTGC, reverse 5′-ACTACTCGAGCTGGAGAAACTTGAGTTCCGA; ThOX2: forward 5′-GTGCAGCGATTTGATGGGTGG, reverse 5′-ACTACTCGAGACTCCAGTTCCTTGGGATGTC). The 5′ noncoding sequence of each human cDNA was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, starting from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of human thyrocytes in culture and three specific primers (ThOX1 5′-GGATGCGAATGTTGAGGAACT, 5′-CCACGCTCACCAGGTCTGAAA, 5′-CCCAACACTGTGCGGTTTCTC; ThOX2 5′-GTCCCAGCGGCTCCTCTGGAA, 5′-CGCGCTGGTCGGGGTCGAACA, 5′-GGATGCGGATGTTGAGGAACT) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNAs subcloned in pBluescript SK+ (pBS) or in pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) were sequenced with the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing method on an automated ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Sequence data handling and analysis were performed using the BLAST sequence programs. Total RNA was obtained from different dog tissues or from dog and human thyrocytes in primary culture by the method of Chirgwin et al. (18Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized as described previously (19Maenhaut C. Brabant G. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3000-3007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA probes, inserted in pBS, were chosen in the 3′ noncoding regions of ThOX1 and ThOX2 to avoid any cross-hybridizations. The dog cDNA probes were a 842-bpEagI-EcoRI fragment of ThOX1 and a 1427-bpKpnI-EcoRI fragment of ThOX2. The human probes were a 687-bp SmaI-EcoRI fragment of ThOX1 and a 1628-bp HincII-XhoI fragment of ThOX2. Filters were washed four times for 30 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the Arg618–His1044 fragment of ThOX1 produced in Escherichia coli by the pET-24d(+) vector system (Novagen). New Zealand White rabbits (Iffa Credo) were subcutaneously injected three times, at a 3-week interval, with 150 μg of recombinant ThOX1 fragment, in the presence of complete (first injection) or incomplete (subsequent injections) Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). Sera were collected 10 days after the third injection and were directly used at a dilution of 1:10,000 in Western blot analyses and 1:200 in immunohistochemistry experiments. Protein extracts were obtained by lysis in classical Laemmli buffer of thyrocytes or Cos-7 cells transfected with ThOX1 cDNA in pcDNA3 and Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were separated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 6 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. 10–30 μg of protein extracts, measured by a paper dye binding assay (20Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), were loaded, and the resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Immune complexes were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the ECL method (NEN Life Science Products). Human paranodular tissue was obtained at surgery and quickly frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. After inhibition of endogenous peroxidase activity by addition of 0.228% periodic acid for 45 s, the frozen sections were incubated for 1 h with the anti-ThOX1 antibody diluted at 1:200 and for 1 h with a second anti-rabbit immunoperoxidase-conjugated antibody. Antibody binding was revealed using diaminobenzidine tetrachloride. Controls were performed by using preimmune serum instead of the first antibody, by omission of the first antibody, or by omission of the first and second antibodies. Thyroperoxidase was immunolocalized using the N-vision technique. The first mouse monoclonal antibody (gift from Dr De Mico) was added on the frozen sections for 1 h at dilution 1:500. The secondary antibody is a goat anti-mouse immunoglobuline conjugated to peroxidase-labeled polymer (Dako En Vision +). The chromogen used for revelation was AEC giving a red staining (3-amino-9 ethylcarbazote). Follicles were isolated by collagenase digestion and differential centrifugation from fresh dog and human thyroid as described previously (21Roger P.P. Hotimski A. Moreau C. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 26: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Roger P. Taton M. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 66: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The follicles were seeded in 60- or 90-mm tissue culture-treated Petri dishes and cultured for 4 days in control medium. This procedure yields cultures containing thyrocytes pure at 99% (23Pohl V. Roger P. Christophe D. Pattyn G. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cells were stimulated for different times with 10 μm forskolin (Calbiochem), 1 milliunit/ml TSH (Sigma), or 25 ng/ml EGF (Sigma). Screening by hybridization at low stringency of two human thyrocyte cDNA libraries with a gp91PhoxcDNA segment yielded systematically two types of clones displaying significant similarity with the probe. When sequenced and aligned, they contained an uninterrupted reading frame corresponding to the 3′ region of gp91Phox, and none of them presented an initiation codon in a favorable consensus. After several unsuccessful attempts to isolate full-length cDNAs from human libraries, a dog λ gt11 cDNA library known to contain large inserts was screened with the most 5′ portions of each type of clones. This yielded canine homologs of the two categories of human clones which, when aligned with gp91Phox, displayed open reading frames extending upstream of gp91Phox initiation codon. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with a human-specific reverse primer and a canine forward primer (see “Experimental Procedures”) allowed extension of the 5′ portions of the two human cDNA clones to a total length of 5,369 and 6,126 bp, respectively. Finally 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction with primers specific of each sequence yielded two presumably complete cDNA sequences: the first was 5,693 bp long (GenBankTM accession number AF230495) with the potential to encode a protein of 1551 amino acids (ThOX1 for thyroid oxidase1); the second was 6,410 bp long (GenBankTMaccession number AF230496) and contained an open reading frame of 1548 amino acids (ThOX2). The primary structures of ThOX1 and ThOX2 showed 83% similarity (Fig.1 A). The molecular weight of the predicted unglycosylated proteins was 177,000. According to von Heijne's algorithm (24von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), both contained a putative signal peptide with Asn23 and Gln26 being the preferred candidates for the N terminus of the mature proteins in ThOX1 and in ThOX2, respectively. Both proteins contained two putative EF-hand motifs,828DKDGNGYLSFREF840 and864DFDGNGLISKDEF876 in ThOX1 and832DKDGNGYLSFREF844 and868DLDENGFLSKDEF880 in ThOX2. The sequence of the 1210 last amino acids of ThOX2 was identical to that of p138Tox, a recently reported cDNA claimed to encode a component of thyroid H2O2 generating system (14Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noël-Hudson M. Dème D. Virion A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37265-37269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). When compared with gp91Phox and Mox1, ThOX1 and ThOX2 displayed 53 and 47% similarity with the former and 54 and 47% identity with the latter, respectively. The similarity was, however, limited to their last 569 C-terminal residues because both of them contained an N-terminal extension with no counterpart in gp91Phox (or Mox1) (982 and 979 residues in ThOX1 and ThOX2, respectively). The homology with gp91Phox allowed, in both ThOX1 and ThOX2, identification of a conserved putative NADPH-binding site (1389GIGVTPF1395,1420IWVTR1424,1486GLRSITHFGR1495, and1517VFSCGP1522 in ThOX1 and1386GIGVTPF1392,1417IWVTR1421,1483GLRSITHFGR1492, and1514VFSCGP1519 in ThOX2), a putative FAD-binding site 1319HPFTLTS1325 in ThOX1 and1316HPFTLTS1322 in ThOX2), and the four histidines (His1130, His1144, His1225, and His1238 in ThOX1 and His1127, His1141, His1222, and His1235 in ThOX2) and an arginine (Arg1087 in ThOX1 and Arg1084 in ThOX2) considered to be implicated in the binding of the heme moiety (25Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Google Scholar). The N-terminal region harbors five putative sites of N-glycosylation (Asn94, Asn342, Asn354, Asn461, and Asn534 in ThOX1 and Asn100, Asn348, Asn382, Asn455, and Asn537 in ThOX2). The sequence organization of ThOX1 and ThOX2 is shared by a predicted protein of Caenorhabditis elegans (GenBankTMaccession number AF043697) found by sequencing of chromosome III of C. elegans (26Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), with which they display respectively 53 and 61% similarity over their entire length. Surprisingly, stretches of amino acids displaying significant sequence similarity with proteins belonging to the peroxidase gene family were found both in the C. elegans protein and in ThOX1,2 in the N-terminal extensions (43% similarity with thyroperoxidase over 500 residues). The hydropathy profiles (TMpred program (27Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar)) of ThOX1 and ThOX2 include seven hydrophobic stretches that could be membrane spanning regions. Considering that Ca2+ binding to EF-hands motifs as well as NADPH and FAD binding presumably occur in the intracellular portions of the protein, we propose a common structure for ThOX1 and ThOX2 shown in Fig. 1 B. The genes corresponding to ThOX1 and ThOX2 have been co-localized on chromosome 15q15.3 using the radiation hybrid panel method of Genebridge 4 (Research Genetics). Comparison of their nucleotide sequence with the current human genomic data base (high throughput genomic sequences, NCBI, National Institutes of Health) revealed stretches of identity corresponding to exons in the partially sequenced 163_P_10 clone on chromosome 15 (AC 009700.3, release of October, 1999). This allowed positioning of at least 20 intron-exon junctions in each gene and confirmed their location in close proximity on chromosome 15. The presence of ThOX1 and ThOX2 mRNA has been explored in 12 different dog tissues by Northern blotting (liver, lymph node, heart, lung, brain, testis, kidney, cerebellum, pancreas, stomach, spleen, and thyroid). Except for a very weak ThOX2 signal in the stomach, it was exclusively found in the thyroid (Fig.2). Regulation of ThOX1 and ThOX2 gene expression was studied in dog and human thyroid cells in primary culture after stimulation for up to 72 h with TSH (1 milliunit/ml), forskolin (10−5m), or EGF (25 ng/ml). In dog and human thyrocytes, Northern blotting revealed transcripts estimated at 5.7 and 6.4 kilobases when hybridizations were performed with the 3′ region of ThOX1- and ThOX2-specific probes, respectively. 10−5m forskolin stimulated accumulation of both ThOX1 and ThOX2 mRNAs of dog thyrocytes after 48 h with a further increase after 72 h (Fig.3 B). This stimulation was reproduced with TSH (Fig. 3 C). EGF had no effect on the mRNA expression. In human thyrocytes the up-regulation by forskolin was less pronounced (Fig. 3 A). The same signal was observed when the blots were hybridized with the 5′-extremity of the ThOX1 (700 bp) and ThOX2 (1200 bp) cDNAs (not shown). The polyclonal antibody raised against a fragment of ThOX1 made it possible to localize ThOX1 in the supranuclear apical pole of all thyroid cells. In some cells the labeling was more pronounced on the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 4 A). No labeling was obtained when using preimmune serum instead of anti-ThOX1 (Fig. 4 B). Localization of ThOX1 protein is similar to that of thyroperoxidase also detected in the apical pole of the thyroid cells (Fig. 4 C). Western blot analysis of lysates of Cos-7 cell transfected with an expression plasmid coding for human ThOX1 detected a major immunoreactive band corresponding to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa (Fig. 5). This mass was close to the theoretical value calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence, the difference being most probably accounted for by N-linked carbohydrate chains. The antibody recognized a protein of the same molecular mass in three rat thyroid cell lines: FRTL-5, WRT, and PCCL3. The protein was also detected in dog and human thyrocytes. Western blots made with thyroid tissues revealed two bands corresponding to proteins with molecular masses of 180 and 190 kDa (Fig. 5). Prior incubation of the antibody with 10 μg of the recombinant ThOX1 fragment used to immunize the rabbit suppressed completely and specifically the bands. Stimulation of dog thyrocytes in culture by forskolin for 48 or 72 h resulted in a steady increase of the accumulation of the immunoreactive material. EGF had no effect even at 72 h. In human thyrocytes a weak stimulation by forskolin was observed at 72 h. Using a strategy based on the functional homology existing between the NADPH oxidase systems in the thyroid and the polymorphonuclear neutrophil, we cloned from cDNA libraries of thyroid cells in primary culture, two different cDNAs displaying convincing sequence similarity with gp91Phox over their entire C-terminal portion (Fig. 1 A). It should be noted that previous attempts using cDNA libraries made from whole thyroid tissue has only yielded the cDNA of gp91Phox. The available arguments to identify the two candidates as components of the thyroid H2O2 generating system include: 1) the level of sequence similarity with gp91Phox (53 and 54% for ThOX1 and ThOX2, respectively) which, apart from indicating a common ancestor (see below), is strongly suggestive of a similar function; 2) the almost exclusive thyroid specificity of the two transcripts (Fig. 2) and the co-localization of ThOX1,2 polypeptides with TPO at the apical pole of thyrocytes (Fig. 4); and 3) the perfect sequence identity of the last 1210 residues of ThOX2 with p138Tox, a thyroid NADPH oxidase reported recently by Dupuy et al. (14Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noël-Hudson M. Dème D. Virion A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37265-37269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) as the catalytic moiety of the thyroid H2O2 generating system. Because this clone was obtained from the sequence of endoproteinase Lys-C peptides generated from a 180-kDa protein displaying NADPH oxidase activity (10Gorin Y. Ohayon R. Carvalho D.P. Dème D. Leseney A. Haye B. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Virion A. Dupuy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the most likely explanation is that the p138Tox clone of Dupuy et al. (14Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noël-Hudson M. Dème D. Virion A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37265-37269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) is an incomplete version of ThOX2 lacking 1014 bases of coding sequence at its 5′ end. In contrast, ThOX2 would encode a full-size 180-kDa NADPH oxidase polypeptide (see Western blot on Fig. 5). The 83% sequence similarity between ThOX2 and ThOX1 strongly suggests that the latter would also encode a thyroid NADPH oxidase. The presence in the protein sequence of conserved FAD-, NADPH-, and heme-binding sites of the gp91Phox fits with the known biochemistry and physiology of the thyroid (28Dumont J.E. Vitam. Horm. 1971; 29: 287-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Finally the regulation of mRNA expression of ThOX1,2 in dog thyroid cells in culture is in total agreement with the previous findings on the functional generation of H2O2 by these cells (29Raspé E. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite these convincing arguments, the definite proof that ThOX1 and ThOX2 are components of the thyroid H2O2 generating system will await reconstitution of H2O2production in transfected nonthyroid cells. This may require co-transfection of constructs encoding additional components that remain to be identified (10Gorin Y. Ohayon R. Carvalho D.P. Dème D. Leseney A. Haye B. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Virion A. Dupuy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In their present state, sequence data bases contain five sequences displaying similarity with NADPH oxidases: gp91Phox, ThOX1, ThOX2, Mox1, and a conceptual protein of C. elegans. Together, they constitute a subfamily of genes encoding flavoproteins. These flavoproteins contain NADPH- and FAD-binding domains, four specific histidines, and a conserved arginine involved in the binding of the heme prosthetic group. gp91Phox possesses a NADPH oxidase activity, which catalyzes the production of superoxide anions (O⨪2) by the one-electron reduction of oxygen using NADPH as the electron donor. The cloning of members of the flavoprotein family, restricted to gp91Phox two years ago, has been extended today to new members that are expressed in nonphagocytic cells; Mox1 presumably involved in cell proliferation and expressed in colon and vascular smooth muscle cells (12Suh Y. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) and NOH, a mammalian H+channel that is in fact a spliced form of Mox1 (13Banfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Alignment of the various members of the protein family allows to classify them in two categories on the basis of the presence of two different building blocks. All five contain amino acid residue homologous segments, the NADPH- and FAD-binding sites, with the potential to encode an NADPH oxidase. Only the C. elegansprotein and both ThOX1 and ThOX2 contain, in addition, a 500-residue N-terminal extension with sequence similarity with peroxidases. The structure of the NADPH oxidase segment has been modelled in gp91Phox (25Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Google Scholar), which allows proposal of a possible structure for the corresponding portion of the ThOX proteins. The presumed structure of this portion of the proteins (Fig. 1 B) shows a large first intracellular loop containing two EF-hand domains probably involved in the direct activation of the enzyme by Ca2+ as demonstrated in porcine and human thyroid membrane fractions (30Deme D. Virion A. Ait Hammou N. Pommier J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 186: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Leseney A. Dème D. Legué O. Ohayon R. Chanson P. Sales J. Pires de Carvalho D. Dupuy C. Virion A. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in intact follicles (32Björkman U. Ekholm R. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and in thyroid slices (9Corvilain B. Van Sande J. Laurent E. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,33Corvilain B. Laurent E. Lecomte M. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The four histidines and the arginine involved in the heme binding in the gp91Phox (25Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Google Scholar) are conserved in ThOX1 and ThOX2 as the FAD- and NADPH-binding sites. These sites are the presumed functional domains of the thyroid NADPH oxidase and should be located at the intracellular side of the apical pole of the thyrocyte. The N-terminal portions of the ThOX polypeptides and the C. elegans predicted protein display homology with peroxidases and harbor three conserved potential sites for N-glycosylation. They are expected to be extracellular. Indeed, the EF-hand containing segment of the NADPH oxidase domain, in ThOX1 and ThOX2, is separated from the peroxidase homology domain by a hydrophobic segment presenting the characteristics of a transmembrane helix. This structural difference between the ThOX proteins and gp91Phox could perhaps be related for an expected functional difference; the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen results in the neutrophil in the formation of superoxide anions, whereas in the thyroid, H2O2 is formed directly (34Dupuy C. Kaniewski J. Dème D. Pommier J. Virion A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In evolutionary terms, the presence of both the NADPH oxidase and the peroxidase homology domains in the ThOX and the C. elegansproteins indicates that a gene fusion event, at the origin of these proteins, predates the separation between vertebrates and invertebrates. The absence of the peroxidase domain in gp91Phox is compatible with two scenarios; either this domain has been lost after the gene duplication event having generated the ThOX genes in the vertebrate lineage or the gp91Phoxgene evolved from an ancestral gene devoid of the peroxidase domain, which would have been lost in C. elegans. The relatively high sequence similarity between the ThOX genes in their NADPH oxidase domains and gp91Phox strongly favors the first scenario. The co-localization of the two ThOX genes on chromosome 15q15.3, as determined by the radiation hybrid method, was confirmed by current information in the genomic data base; the two genes are very closely linked, perhaps in tandem, within a 153,400-bp bacterial artificial chromosome in the process of being fully sequenced. Evolution of genes by fusion of segments encoding functional entities, which may remain separate in other genes, has been described (35Marcotte E.M. Pellegrini M. Thompson M.J. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1999; 402: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 36Enright A.J. Iliopoulos I. Kyrpides N.C. Ouzounis C.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The organification of iodide and thyroid hormonogenesis make use both of ThOX proteins, containing an NADPH oxidase and a peroxidase homology domain, and thyroperoxidase. Considering the toxicity of H2O2, association of two enzymes in a complex allowing channeling of H2O2 would make physiological sense (37Van Sande J. Ketelbant-Balasse P. Schell-Frederick E. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 26: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 38Björkman U. Ekholm R. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Future dissection of structure-function relationships of the ThOX proteins will be needed to identify the respective roles and possible interactions of thyroperoxidase and the N-terminal peroxidase homology domain of ThOX1 and ThOX2. The existence of the two distinct ThOX genes raises the question of their respective roles. Both are expressed in a thyroid-specific manner and controlled in a similar way by TSH. Among other possibilities, they could constitute redundant entities or be implicated in a heteropolymeric structure, with each subunit playing a distinct role in the catalytic reaction. In the first case, with four copies of ThOX per diploid genome, the system should be particularly resistant to alteration by loss-of-function mutations. On the contrary, if a heteropolymeric structure is involved, depending on the stoechiometry of the complex, one could observe dominant negative effects in heterozygotes with mutations affecting the structure of the holoprotein. The rarity of cases with congenital defects of organification without mutations of the thyroperoxidase gene (40Niepomniszcze H. Targovnik H.M. Gluzman B.E. Curutchet P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1987; 62: 344-348Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 41de Vijlder J.J.M. Vulsma T. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbars's The Thyroid. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 479-755Google Scholar) would rather argue in favor of the first hypothesis, but here also, clarification will require activity reconstitution. Regulation of H2O2 generation is known to occur both at the gene expression and posttranscriptional levels. At the former level the results of Northern and Western blotting experiments with dog thyrocytes agree with biochemical data showing that the capacity of H2O2 formation is stimulated after a chronic elevation of cAMP (29Raspé E. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although Northern blotting experiments clearly indicate that both ThOX1 and ThOX2 mRNAs are up-regulated by cAMP agonists, in the absence of antibodies specific for the individual proteins, it can only be concluded from Western blots that one or both proteins accumulate under the same conditions. In human but not in dog thyroid, TSH activates the phosphatidylinositol triphosphate-phospholipase C cascade. Acute stimulation of iodide organification and H2O2production by the PIP2-phospholipase C cascade and by calcium has been observed in humans, dogs, and other species (9Corvilain B. Van Sande J. Laurent E. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 33Corvilain B. Laurent E. Lecomte M. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

The presence of the two EF-hands in the ThOX proteins provides a structural basis for these effects. The successful cloning of human H2O2 generating system opens new perspectives in the physiopathology and diagnosis of thyroid diseases. It should allow to demonstrate the genetic lesion of this system in iodination defects observed in congenital hypothyroidism, thyroid cold adenomas, and thyroid cancer with normal thyroperoxidase (43Dumont J.E.

The close proximity of thyroperoxidase and ThOX at the apical pole of thyrocytes suggests that autoimmune reactions leading to the generation of autoantibodies directed against the former might spread to the latter in Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' diseases. By analogy with anti-thyroperoxidase autoantibodies, it is conceivable that some antibodies will have an inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity.

All cells have specific mechanisms to eliminate damaged proteins (3Dice J.F. Lysosomal Pathways of Protein Degradation.

Age-related defects in intracellular proteolytic systems have been proposed to cause the accumulation of abnormal proteins (6Dice J.F. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was initially supported by the fact that overall rates of protein degradation decline with age (1Makrides S. Biol. Rev. 1983; 83: 393-422Google Scholar,7Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14624-14627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Several different intracellular proteolytic systems contribute to total rates of protein degradation including the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a group of calcium-dependent proteases or calpains and lysosomes. Lysosomes are the proteolytic system most affected by age (8Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 25-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of ubiquitinated protein increases in “old” tissues, but its degradation rate does not significantly change with age (9Pan J. Short S.R. Goff S.A. Dice J.F. Exp. Gerontol. 1993; 28: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Some of the proteolytic activities of the 20 S proteasome, the core of the 26 S proteasome responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated and some nonubiquitinated proteins, change with age, but the overall proteolytic rate is not altered (10Shibatani T. Ward W.F. J. Gerontol. 1996; 51: B316-B322Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An increase rather than a decrease in calcium-dependent degradation of proteins with age has been reported in different tissues (11Glaser T. Schwarz-Ben Meir N. Barnoy S. Barak S. Eshhar Z. Kosower N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Proteins can be transported to lysosomes for degradation following several different pathways. The best characterized are endocytosis, crinophagy, macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (3Dice J.F. Lysosomal Pathways of Protein Degradation. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit, Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar, 12Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Mol. Med. (Berl. ). 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Not all these lysosomal pathways of proteolysis are equally affected by age. A decrease of macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and some forms of endocytosis (receptor-mediated endocytosis) occurs in most tissues of old organisms (7Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14624-14627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Terman A. Gerontology. 1995; 41: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Koenig J. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).Chaperone-mediated autophagy is activated in many types of confluent cells in culture during serum deprivation and in several tissues (liver, kidney, heart, spleen) from whole animals after prolonged starvation (15Backer J. Bourret L. Dice J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2166-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Wing S. Chiang H.L. Goldberg A.L. Dice J.F. Biochem.

Under those conditions, chaperone-mediated autophagy accounts for the degradation of 30% of cytosolic proteins. The identified substrates for this pathway include some glycolytic enzymes, transcription factors and their regulatory proteins, cytosolic proteases, cytosolic forms of secretory proteins, and lipid- and calcium-binding proteins (3Dice J.F. Lysosomal Pathways of Protein Degradation. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit, Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar, 12Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Mol. Med. (Berl. ). 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All substrate proteins contain in their sequence a motif biochemically related to the pentapeptide KFERQ that targets the proteins for this pathway of lysosomal degradation (18Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). That motif is recognized by a molecular chaperone, the 73-kDa heat-shock cognate protein (hsc73),1 which interacts with the substrate protein in the cytosol (19Chiang H.-L. Terlecky S.R. Plant C.P. Dice J.F. Science. 1989; 246: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 20Terlecky S. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chaperone-substrate protein complex binds to the lysosomal membrane through a receptor protein, the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a) (21Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Once bound to the lysosomal membrane, the substrate protein is transported into the lysosomes assisted by another chaperone, the lysosomal hsc73 (ly-hsc73) that is normally present in the lysosomal matrix (22Agarraberes F. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5606-5615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). No transport of substrates takes place if ly-hsc73 is absent or experimentally blocked by endocytosis of specific antibodies. The levels of ly-hsc73 increase after nutrient deprivation and contribute to the increased chaperone-mediated autophagy rates under those conditions (17Cuervo A.M. Knecht E. Terlecky S. Dice J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1200-C1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Terlecky S. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of the receptor at the lysosomal membrane is the rate-limiting step in protein binding and uptake (12Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Mol. Med. (Berl. ). 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). This is regulated by changes in the lysosomal degradation of lamp2a and in its dynamic distribution between the lysosomal membrane and matrix, where a portion of intact lamp2a is located (24Jadot M. Wattiaux R. Mainferme F. Dubois F. Claessens A. Wattiaux-De Coninck S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).We have previously reported a decrease in chaperone-mediated autophagy using confluent cultures of senescent human fibroblasts (7Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14624-14627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Okada A. Dice J.F. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1984; 26: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the decrease in chaperone-mediated autophagy with age is also evident using lysosomes isolated from rat liver. In addition, we have identified the effects of age on the various steps required for the degradation of proteins by this autophagic pathway. In both rat liver and human fibroblasts, the amount of lamp2a on the lysosomal membrane decreases with age.DISCUSSIONChaperone-mediated autophagy in rat liver decreases with age (Fig.3 A). In this work we demonstrate that binding and uptake of substrate proteins by lysosomes (Figs. 4 and 8) are the steps affected by age. We found no age-related changes in the amount or activities of the cytosolic chaperone hsc73 (Fig. 5). The lower rates of substrate uptake by lysosomes with age (Fig. 8 A) directly correlated with a decrease in the lysosomal membrane levels of lamp2a, a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (Fig. 8 B). Interestingly, the number of lysosomes containing hsc73 in their matrix, and therefore active for chaperone-mediated autophagy, increased at advanced age (Figs. 6, B and C and 8 C). We propose here that the increase in the number of lysosomes involved in this pathway in old rats might result from a late attempt to compensate for the decreased chaperone-mediated autophagy.The similarity of the lysosomes isolated from young and old rat livers (Fig. 1 and Tables I and II) clearly contrast with the dramatic age-related changes in the lysosomal compartment described histologically by other authors (35De Priester W. Van Manen R. Knook D. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1984; 26: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Schellens J. Cell Tissue Res. 1974; 155: 455-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 38Ferland G. Audet M. Tuchweber B. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1992; 64: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) who found an increase in the number and size of secondary lysosomes and of ceroid/lipofuscin deposits with age. The similarity of lysosomes isolated from young and old rats is probably because our lysosomal purification procedures have been optimized to obtain a lysosomal preparation mainly enriched in lysosomes active for chaperone-mediated autophagy. Thus the abnormally functioning lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes reported in other studies were not present in the lysosomal fraction analyzed here (39Terman A. Brunk U. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 104: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Levels of lamp2a at the lysosomal membrane are regulated by two different mechanisms, degradation of lamp2a at the lysosomal membrane and changes in the dynamic distribution of lamp2a between the membrane and the matrix (40Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Whether the lower levels of lamp2a in the membrane of old rat lysosomes results from alterations of those regulatory parameters or from other completely independent processes needs to be further investigated.Interestingly, rates of substrate protein uptake decreased more dramatically with age than did substrate binding (Fig. 8 A), and a better correlation can be established between the decrease in substrate uptake and in lysosomal membrane levels of lamp2a (Fig.8 B). A possible explanation for those results is a dissociation between the binding and uptake steps with age. Thus, it is possible that under normal conditions binding of the substrate proteins to lamp2a is efficiently coupled to transport. If that coupling mechanism becomes defective with age, lower rates of protein uptake might result for the same levels of protein binding.Other factors may contribute to the decrease in chaperone-mediated autophagy with age. Substrate proteins could undergo age-related changes that diminish their lysosomal uptake. However, we have found no evidence for substrate protein modification in GAPDH, RNase A, IκB, or hsc73 with respect to their ability for binding and uptake by normal lysosomes (data not shown).The cytosolic levels and in vitro stimulatory effect on chaperone-mediated autophagy of the cytosolic hsc73 isolated from rat livers remain unchanged with age (Fig. 5). However it is still possible that other cytosolic components with a modulatory effect on hsc73 might undergo age-related changes and modify hsc73 activity in vivo. The identification of those components will allow us address those questions in the future.Changes in the intralysosomal environment could also contribute directly or indirectly to the decreased lysosomal activity with age. Changes in intralysosomal pH or levels of oxidative agents could result in altered function of proteins involved in the transport of substrates such as hsc73 or lamp2a. Changes in some lysosomal matrix properties with age could, for example, modify the rates of lamp2a degradation at the lysosomal membrane or block the reinsertion of the matrix lamp2a back into the lysosomal membrane (40Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and consequently cause the decrease in membrane levels of lamp2a observed in old rat lysosomes.By analogy with what we have previously described for rats subjected to prolonged starvation (26Cuervo A.M. Terlecky S. Dice J.F. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26374-26380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the decreased degradation rates of hsc73 inside lysosomes not active for chaperone-mediated autophagy in old rat livers (Fig. 6 E) would make them competent for substrate uptake. This seems to be an adaptation activated late in age (Fig. 8 C) but the larger number of lysosomes putatively active for chaperone-mediated autophagy in the oldest rats still does not compensate for the decreased levels of receptor protein. We hypothesize that the attempted recruitment of more lysosomes for chaperone-mediated autophagy during aging might be a secondary effect of the decline in chaperone-mediated autophagy because of reduced lamp2a levels.It is still unknown how ly-hsc73 reaches the lysosomal matrix. hsc73 contains two KFERQ-related motives, and thus part of its transport can take place by chaperone-mediated autophagy. However, the existence of a different mechanism for hsc73 transport is also possible because the protein can be efficiently transported and degraded by lysosomes with lower activity for chaperone-mediated autophagy (23Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5606-5615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). An increase in the rates of lysosomal uptake of hsc73 by that alternative mechanism with age may also explain the described higher levels of ly-hsc73.We have previously reported a decrease in chaperone-mediated autophagy in senescent cells in culture (7Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14624-14627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Okada A. Dice J.F. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1984; 26: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we show a similar decrease in rat liver and demonstrate that it is mainly caused by a defect in substrate binding and uptake because of a reduced level of lamp2a. In both systems, cultured cells and rat liver, levels of lamp2a at the lysosomal membrane decrease with age and that decrease correlates with the decreased chaperone-mediated autophagy activity. These results support the use of senescent human fibroblasts for the study of aging at least with regard to the decline in chaperone-mediated autophagy.In young cells in culture we have previously demonstrated that overexpressing lamp2a results in increased rates of chaperone-mediated autophagy (21Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Using similar experimental approaches we should be able to correct the decreased levels of lamp2a with age. We can then determine whether correcting this protein degradation pathway decreases the levels of abnormal proteins that accumulate with age. One of the common characteristics of senescent cells is the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the cytosol (1Makrides S. Biol. Rev. 1983; 83: 393-422Google Scholar). The described protein alterations are mostly post-translational modifications (2Gafni A. J. Am. Geriatr.

Rev. 1993; 73: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was initially supported by the fact that overall rates of protein degradation decline with age (1Makrides S. Biol. Rev. 1983; 83: 393-422Google Scholar,7Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14624-14627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several different intracellular proteolytic systems contribute to total rates of protein degradation including the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a group of calcium-dependent proteases or calpains and lysosomes. Lysosomes are the proteolytic system most affected by age (8Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 25-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of ubiquitinated protein increases in “old” tissues, but its degradation rate does not significantly change with age (9Pan J. Short S.R. Goff S.A. Dice J.F. Exp. Gerontol. 1993; 28: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Some of the proteolytic activities of the 20 S proteasome, the core of the 26 S proteasome responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated and some nonubiquitinated proteins, change with age, but the overall proteolytic rate is not altered (10Shibatani T. Ward W.F. J. Gerontol. 1996; 51: B316-B322Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An increase rather than a decrease in calcium-dependent degradation of proteins with age has been reported in different tissues (11Glaser T. Schwarz-Ben Meir N. Barnoy S. Barak S. Eshhar Z. Kosower N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Proteins can be transported to lysosomes for degradation following several different pathways. The best characterized are endocytosis, crinophagy, macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (3Dice J.F. Lysosomal Pathways of Protein Degradation. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit, Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar, 12Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Mol. Med. (Berl. ). 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Not all these lysosomal pathways of proteolysis are equally affected by age. A decrease of macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and some forms of endocytosis (receptor-mediated endocytosis) occurs in most tissues of old organisms (7Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14624-14627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Terman A. Gerontology. 1995; 41: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Koenig J. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Chaperone-mediated autophagy is activated in many types of confluent cells in culture during serum deprivation and in several tissues (liver, kidney, heart, spleen) from whole animals after prolonged starvation (15Backer J. Bourret L. Dice J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2166-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Wing S. Chiang H.L. Goldberg A.L. Dice J.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Cuervo A.M. Knecht E. Terlecky S. Dice J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1200-C1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under those conditions, chaperone-mediated autophagy accounts for the degradation of 30% of cytosolic proteins. The identified substrates for this pathway include some glycolytic enzymes, transcription factors and their regulatory proteins, cytosolic proteases, cytosolic forms of secretory proteins, and lipid- and calcium-binding proteins (3Dice J.F. Lysosomal Pathways of Protein Degradation. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit, Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar, 12Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Mol. Med. (Berl. ). 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All substrate proteins contain in their sequence a motif biochemically related to the pentapeptide KFERQ that targets the proteins for this pathway of lysosomal degradation (18Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). That motif is recognized by a molecular chaperone, the 73-kDa heat-shock cognate protein (hsc73),1 which interacts with the substrate protein in the cytosol (19Chiang H.-L. Terlecky S.R. Plant C.P. Dice J.F. Science. 1989; 246: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 20Terlecky S. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chaperone-substrate protein complex binds to the lysosomal membrane through a receptor protein, the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a) (21Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Once bound to the lysosomal membrane, the substrate protein is transported into the lysosomes assisted by another chaperone, the lysosomal hsc73 (ly-hsc73) that is normally present in the lysosomal matrix (22Agarraberes F. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5606-5615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). No transport of substrates takes place if ly-hsc73 is absent or experimentally blocked by endocytosis of specific antibodies. The levels of ly-hsc73 increase after nutrient deprivation and contribute to the increased chaperone-mediated autophagy rates under those conditions (17Cuervo A.M. Knecht E. Terlecky S. Dice J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1200-C1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Terlecky S. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of the receptor at the lysosomal membrane is the rate-limiting step in protein binding and uptake (12Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Mol. Med. (Berl. ). 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). This is regulated by changes in the lysosomal degradation of lamp2a and in its dynamic distribution between the lysosomal membrane and matrix, where a portion of intact lamp2a is located (24Jadot M. Wattiaux R. Mainferme F. Dubois F. Claessens A. Wattiaux-De Coninck S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have previously reported a decrease in chaperone-mediated autophagy using confluent cultures of senescent human fibroblasts (7Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14624-14627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Okada A. Dice J.F. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1984; 26: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the decrease in chaperone-mediated autophagy with age is also evident using lysosomes isolated from rat liver. In addition, we have identified the effects of age on the various steps required for the degradation of proteins by this autophagic pathway. In both rat liver and human fibroblasts, the amount of lamp2a on the lysosomal membrane decreases with age. DISCUSSIONChaperone-mediated autophagy in rat liver decreases with age (Fig.3 A). In this work we demonstrate that binding and uptake of substrate proteins by lysosomes (Figs. 4 and 8) are the steps affected by age. We found no age-related changes in the amount or activities of the cytosolic chaperone hsc73 (Fig. 5). The lower rates of substrate uptake by lysosomes with age (Fig. 8 A) directly correlated with a decrease in the lysosomal membrane levels of lamp2a, a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (Fig. 8 B). Interestingly, the number of lysosomes containing hsc73 in their matrix, and therefore active for chaperone-mediated autophagy, increased at advanced age (Figs. 6, B and C and 8 C). We propose here that the increase in the number of lysosomes involved in this pathway in old rats might result from a late attempt to compensate for the decreased chaperone-mediated autophagy.The similarity of the lysosomes isolated from young and old rat livers (Fig. 1 and Tables I and II) clearly contrast with the dramatic age-related changes in the lysosomal compartment described histologically by other authors (35De Priester W. Van Manen R. Knook D. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1984; 26: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Schellens J. Cell Tissue Res. 1974; 155: 455-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 38Ferland G. Audet M. Tuchweber B. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1992; 64: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) who found an increase in the number and size of secondary lysosomes and of ceroid/lipofuscin deposits with age. The similarity of lysosomes isolated from young and old rats is probably because our lysosomal purification procedures have been optimized to obtain a lysosomal preparation mainly enriched in lysosomes active for chaperone-mediated autophagy. Thus the abnormally functioning lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes reported in other studies were not present in the lysosomal fraction analyzed here (39Terman A. Brunk U. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 104: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Levels of lamp2a at the lysosomal membrane are regulated by two different mechanisms, degradation of lamp2a at the lysosomal membrane and changes in the dynamic distribution of lamp2a between the membrane and the matrix (40Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Whether the lower levels of lamp2a in the membrane of old rat lysosomes results from alterations of those regulatory parameters or from other completely independent processes needs to be further investigated.Interestingly, rates of substrate protein uptake decreased more dramatically with age than did substrate binding (Fig. 8 A), and a better correlation can be established between the decrease in substrate uptake and in lysosomal membrane levels of lamp2a (Fig.8 B). A possible explanation for those results is a dissociation between the binding and uptake steps with age. Thus, it is possible that under normal conditions binding of the substrate proteins to lamp2a is efficiently coupled to transport. If that coupling mechanism becomes defective with age, lower rates of protein uptake might result for the same levels of protein binding.Other factors may contribute to the decrease in chaperone-mediated autophagy with age. Substrate proteins could undergo age-related changes that diminish their lysosomal uptake. However, we have found no evidence for substrate protein modification in GAPDH, RNase A, IκB, or hsc73 with respect to their ability for binding and uptake by normal lysosomes (data not shown).The cytosolic levels and in vitro stimulatory effect on chaperone-mediated autophagy of the cytosolic hsc73 isolated from rat livers remain unchanged with age (Fig. 5). However it is still possible that other cytosolic components with a modulatory effect on hsc73 might undergo age-related changes and modify hsc73 activity in vivo. The identification of those components will allow us address those questions in the future.Changes in the intralysosomal environment could also contribute directly or indirectly to the decreased lysosomal activity with age. Changes in intralysosomal pH or levels of oxidative agents could result in altered function of proteins involved in the transport of substrates such as hsc73 or lamp2a. Changes in some lysosomal matrix properties with age could, for example, modify the rates of lamp2a degradation at the lysosomal membrane or block the reinsertion of the matrix lamp2a back into the lysosomal membrane (40Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and consequently cause the decrease in membrane levels of lamp2a observed in old rat lysosomes.By analogy with what we have previously described for rats subjected to prolonged starvation (26Cuervo A.M. Terlecky S. Dice J.F. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26374-26380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the decreased degradation rates of hsc73 inside lysosomes not active for chaperone-mediated autophagy in old rat livers (Fig. 6 E) would make them competent for substrate uptake. This seems to be an adaptation activated late in age (Fig. 8 C) but the larger number of lysosomes putatively active for chaperone-mediated autophagy in the oldest rats still does not compensate for the decreased levels of receptor protein. We hypothesize that the attempted recruitment of more lysosomes for chaperone-mediated autophagy during aging might be a secondary effect of the decline in chaperone-mediated autophagy because of reduced lamp2a levels.It is still unknown how ly-hsc73 reaches the lysosomal matrix. hsc73 contains two KFERQ-related motives, and thus part of its transport can take place by chaperone-mediated autophagy. However, the existence of a different mechanism for hsc73 transport is also possible because the protein can be efficiently transported and degraded by lysosomes with lower activity for chaperone-mediated autophagy (23Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5606-5615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). An increase in the rates of lysosomal uptake of hsc73 by that alternative mechanism with age may also explain the described higher levels of ly-hsc73.We have previously reported a decrease in chaperone-mediated autophagy in senescent cells in culture (7Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14624-14627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Okada A. Dice J.F. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1984; 26: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we show a similar decrease in rat liver and demonstrate that it is mainly caused by a defect in substrate binding and uptake because of a reduced level of lamp2a. In both systems, cultured cells and rat liver, levels of lamp2a at the lysosomal membrane decrease with age and that decrease correlates with the decreased chaperone-mediated autophagy activity. These results support the use of senescent human fibroblasts for the study of aging at least with regard to the decline in chaperone-mediated autophagy.In young cells in culture we have previously demonstrated that overexpressing lamp2a results in increased rates of chaperone-mediated autophagy (21Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Using similar experimental approaches we should be able to correct the decreased levels of lamp2a with age. We can then determine whether correcting this protein degradation pathway decreases the levels of abnormal proteins that accumulate with age. Chaperone-mediated autophagy in rat liver decreases with age (Fig.3 A). In this work we demonstrate that binding and uptake of substrate proteins by lysosomes (Figs. 4 and 8) are the steps affected by age.

The etiology of this characteristic clinical syndrome remains unknown. We demonstrate that the HIV protease inhibitor, indinavir, dramatically inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner (63% inhibition observed with 100 μm indinavir). Indinavir treatment did not affect early insulin signaling events or the translocation of intracellular Glut1 or Glut4 glucose transporters to the cell surface. To determine whether indinavir may be directly affecting the intrinsic transport activity of glucose transporters, the Glut1 and Glut4 isoforms were heterologously expressed and analyzed inXenopus laevis oocytes. Indinavir at 100 μmhad no effect on Glut1 transport activity in Xenopusoocytes, whereas Glut4 activity was significantly inhibited (45% inhibition). Similar effects on glucose transport were observed for other HIV protease inhibitors. We conclude that HIV protease inhibitors as a class are capable of selectively inhibiting the transport function of Glut4 and that this effect may be responsible for a major iatrogenic complication frequently observed in HIV patients.

Upon insulin binding, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor is activated, which in turn initiates a complex signaling cascade (22.Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The downstream activation of a wortmannin-sensitive PI 3-kinase appears to be essential for the metabolic effects of insulin (22.Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol.

Ultimately, insulin signaling impinges on intracellular Glut4 vesicles, causing their rapid exocytosis and fusion with the plasma membrane (9.Park C.R. Johnson L.H. Am. J.

This phenomenon, known as Glut4 translocation, can account for most of the increase in cellular glucose uptake capacity stimulated by insulin in fat (24.Holman G.D. Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Flower C.J.

The purpose of this study was to address whether or not HIV protease inhibitors can directly affect the facilitated transport of glucose into insulin-responsive cells. We demonstrate here that HIV protease inhibitors selectively and potently decrease the intrinsic transport activity of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter isoform Glut4 without substantially affecting early insulin signaling events or Glut4 translocation. The clinical ramifications of this finding are discussed. Indinavir, ritonavir, and amprenavir were obtained from Merck, Abbott, and Glaxo Wellcome, respectively.Xenopus laevis imported African frogs were purchased fromXenopus Express (Homasassa, FL). All other reagents unless otherwise specified were obtained from Sigma. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown to confluence and 48 h later subjected to the differentiation protocol described previously (28.Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and used 10 to 15 days post-differentiation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown in 3.5-cm dishes were serum-starved for at least 3 h and then washed three times with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer. [3H]2-Deoxyglucose uptake (50 μm cold 2-deoxyglucose) was measured in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer as described previously (28.Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) for 6 min at 37 °C under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (1 μminsulin for 20 min). When indicated, HIV protease inhibitors (indinavir, ritonavir, or amprenavir) were added to the cells at various concentrations 6 min prior to the assay. Stock solutions of indinavir and amprenavir were made in water. Ritonavir was dissolved in ethanol. When adding ritonavir to cells, the final concentration of ethanol was less than 0.5%. Nonspecific uptake was measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B and subtracted from the experimental values. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown in 10-cm dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in serum-free DMEM in the absence or presence of 100 μm indinavir. After treatment with or without insulin (1 μm for 20 min), the cells were scraped in ice-cold HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 255 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmsodium vanadate, and general protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After homogenization through 11 passes in a Yamato LSC homogenizer (1200 rpm) at 4 °C, subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation was performed as described previously (29.Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocyte fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Glut1 and Glut4 transporters were detected using polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 16 residues of the respective transporter isoform. The autoradiographic signals were quantitated by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were detected using the monoclonal PY-20 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Phospho-Akt specific antibodies (New England Biolabs) were used to detect Akt phosphorylated at threonine 308 and serine 473. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown on no. 1 glass coverslips. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 μm indinavir as described above for subcellular fractionation. After treatment with or without insulin (1 μm for 20 min), whole cells were fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using methanol. PM sheets adherent to the coverslip were prepared by gentle sonication as described previously (30.Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and subsequently fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. Glut1 and Glut4 subcellular distributions in the prepared coverslips were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies essentially as described previously (30.Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Images were taken using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope. X. laevis oocytes were prepared and injected as described previously (31.Keller K. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18884-18889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 50 ng of either Glut1 or Glut4 mRNA synthesized in vitro (Megascript RNA synthesis kit, Ambion). After a 3-day incubation in Barth's saline containing albumin at 18 °C, groups of 15–20 oocytes were washed, and [3H]2-deoxyglucose (50 μm) uptake measurements were performed in Barth's saline at 22 °C for 30 min. HIV protease inhibitors (indinavir, amprenavir, or ritonavir) were added to the assay mixture immediately prior to the uptake measurement. We initially examined the effect of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor indinavir on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a system that responds robustly to insulin. When 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with indinavir, a statistically significant dose-dependent decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was observed with an inhibition of 63% at the maximal concentration of indinavir tested (100 μm; Fig.1 A). At 10 μm, which is within the physiologic range of plasma concentrations achievedin vivo in HIV patients (2.Flexner C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), indinavir inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 26% (p < 0.0001, ANOVA with Fisher PLSD posthoc analysis). Basal glucose uptake was largely unaffected by indinavir, although at 20 μm a modest increase was reproducibly observed. The inhibitory effect of indinavir on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was very rapid as the drug was added to the cells only 6 min prior to the uptake assay. Furthermore, removal of indinavir rapidly restored normal insulin-responsive glucose uptake within 30 min (data not shown). Inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake appears to be a general property of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, as two other compounds within this class, amprenavir and ritonavir, also exhibited an effect comparable with that of indinavir (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblot analysis of 3T3-L1 adipocyte subcellular fractions with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that insulin receptor autophosphorylation and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 occurred normally in cells exposed to indinavir (Fig. 2 A). As the metabolic effects of insulin require PI 3-kinase activation (22.Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 23.Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), thein vivo phosphorylation status of the downstream Akt kinase was assessed using phospho-Akt-specific antibodies. Indinavir was found to have no effect on the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on threonine 308 or serine 473 (Fig. 2 B), thus demonstrating that the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway remained intact. Insulin acutely stimulates glucose uptake in muscle and fat cells by triggering the translocation of intracellularly sequestered glucose transporters, predominantly the Glut4 transporter isoform, to the plasma membrane (32.Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes express Glut1 and Glut4 (25.Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 28.Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and both of these transporter isoforms appeared to translocate properly to the cell surface in response to insulin despite the presence of 100 μm indinavir. The glucose transporter content in the PM fractions detected by isoform-specific antibodies increased with insulin by 81 and 63% for Glut1, and by 36 and 38% for Glut4 in control and indinavir-treated cells, respectively. Concomitantly, the transporter content in the low density microsome (LDM) fractions decreased by 37 and 48% for Glut1, and by 21 and 19% for Glut4 in control and indinavir-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 2 C). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of whole cells and plasma membrane “sheets” also showed that the subcellular distribution of glucose transporters was unchanged in indinavir-treated samples relative to control cells. Both control and indinavir-treated cells exhibited increased Glut1 and Glut4 staining at the plasma membrane upon stimulation with insulin (Fig. 2 D). The rapid onset of inhibition observed in the glucose uptake assay (Fig. 1), in which indinavir was added to the cells after sufficient time had elapsed for the majority of the transporters to reach the plasma membrane following insulin stimulation (33.Karnieli E. Zarnowski M.J. Hissin P.J. Simpson I.A. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4772-4777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Kozka I.J. Biochem.

J. 1992; 281: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), is consistent with indinavir acting at a site subsequent to the translocation of transporters to the plasma membrane. Additionally, the extent of inhibition of transport activity did not change if indinavir was added either before or after 20 min of insulin stimulation (data not shown). Glut1 and Glut4 were heterologously expressed in X. laevisoocytes by microinjection of their respective mRNA to test the possibility that indinavir might be directly inhibiting the intrinsic transport activity of glucose transporters. Indinavir at 100 μm had no effect on Glut1 activity in Xenopusoocytes. Remarkably, however, the activity of Glut4 expressed in oocytes was inhibited by 45% at the maximal dose of indinavir tested (100 μm), an effect of comparable magnitude to that observed in insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.3 A). Ritonavir and amprenavir also selectively inhibited Glut4 by 54 and 42%, respectively (Fig.3 B). The data obtained in Xenopus oocytes are consistent with what is observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, in which basal (indinavir-resistant) and insulin-stimulated (indinavir-inhibitable) glucose uptake are largely mediated by Glut1 and Glut4, respectively (25.Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). From the above data, we conclude that HIV protease inhibitors unexpectedly act as potent, isoform-specific inhibitors of the transport function of the Glut4 glucose transporter. This is the first demonstration that pharmacologic manipulation of glucose transport is feasible in a selective manner. An agent that can reversibly induce an insulin-resistant state would be a very useful tool in developing model systems that mimic the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Glut4 is predominantly expressed in tissues responsible for the bulk of whole body glucose disposal (skeletal/cardiac muscle and fat) (18.James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 19.Birnbaum M.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 20.Charron M.J. Brosius F.D.

As glucose transport is the rate-limiting step for whole body glucose disposal in rodents (36.Marshall B.A. Ren J.M. Johnson D.W. Gibbs E.M. Lillquist J.S. Soeller W.C. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J.

Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of retroviral protease inhibitors on Glut4 is therefore likely to be the direct cause of insulin resistance observed in HIV patients receiving this class of drugs. In predisposed individuals, diabetes can result after pancreatic β cells fail to compensate for the insulin resistance. A recent clinical study employing a longitudinal design comparing fasting glucose and insulin levels before and after administration of protease inhibitor therapy demonstrated that insulin resistance is apparent after a relatively short period of time (an average of 3.4 months between measurements) before significant changes in body weight and fat distribution occur (40.Mulligan K. Grunfeld C. Tai V.W. Algren H. Pang M. Chernoff D.N. Lo J.C. Schambelan M. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2000; 23: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The fact that insulin resistance appears to precede the manifestation of lipodystrophy is consistent with our hypothesis that indinavir directly causes insulin resistance through its effect on Glut4, rather than insulin resistance developing secondary to the lipodystrophy. We predict that insulin resistance may occur much earlier than reported thus far, perhaps even immediately upon initiation of protease inhibitor therapy. Moreover, if our hypothesis is correct, insulin resistance should be maximal whenin vivo protease inhibitor concentrations are maximal. Thus, depending on the dosing regimen and the pharmacokinetic characteristic of the protease inhibitor used, simple measurements of fasting glucose and insulin levels may be underestimating the true extent of insulin resistance that actually occurs. A knockout mouse that lacks Glut4 is insulin-resistant, and interestingly, almost devoid of fat tissue (41.Katz E.B. Stenbit A.E. Hatton K. DePinho R. Charron M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, Glut4 activityper se may somehow be required for adipogenesis. If this is true, the protease inhibitor's direct effect on Glut4 may account for the clinically observed lipodystrophy in addition to the insulin resistance. Recent reports that HIV protease inhibitors interfere with adipogenesis in cultured cell models (42.Zhang B. Macnaul K. Szalkowski D. Li Z. Berger J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 4274-4277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Wentworth J.M. Burris T.P. Chatterjee V.K.K. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: R7-R10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) do not contradict this scenario. HIV patients treated with protease inhibitors show a characteristic loss of adipose tissues at peripheral sites as opposed to the abdomen (44.Carr A. Samaras K. Burton S. Law M. Freund J. Chrisholm D.J. Cooper D.A. AIDS. 1998; 12: F51-F58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar). We speculate that peripheral adipocytes preferentially synthesize lipid de novo from blood glucose, whereas abdominal adipocytes may obtain their lipid primarily from circulating triglycerides. As retroviral protease inhibitors play a vital role in prolonging the lifespan of HIV patients and are often administered over an extended period of time, the metabolic side effects and their chronic consequences are likely to be more prevalent in the future. Further drug development may be necessary to design new compounds that maintain the efficacy in the management of HIV infection, but that also minimize the detrimental effect on the glucose transport system observed in this study.

To characterize the nature of laminin 5 processing, we determined the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the proteolytic fragments produced by the processing events.

Gelbart W.M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Genetic and developmental expression studies have also indicated that the tld gene product TLD participates within the same developmental pathway as the product of the decapentaplegicgene, DPP, the fly cognate of mammalian BMP-2 and BMP-4. The latter copurify from bone extracts with BMP-1(6), thus suggesting a signaling pathway that has been conserved in flies and mammals. An intact protease domain of TLD is required for the correct functioning of DPP (15Finelli A.L. Xie T. Bossie C.A. Blackman R.K. Padgett R.W. Genetics. 1995; 141: 271-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Actual substrates for BMP-1/TLD-like proteases had not been demonstrated prior to the identification by Kessler et al.(2Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) of BMP-1 as a type I procollagen C-proteinase. However, fibrillar collagens have not been detected in Drosophila, and recent evidence suggests that TLD acts in dorsal-ventral patterning of Drosophila by cleaving the product of the short gastrulation gene SOG, a secreted protein inferred to bind DPP in a latent complex (16Marques G.

Similarly, the BMP-1/TLD-like proteasesXenopus Xolloid (17Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M.

Science. 1997; 278: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and BMP-1 itself (31Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) have now been shown to have the ability to cleave Chordin, the vertebrate cognate of SOG (45Holley S.A. Jackson P.D. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Hoffmann F.M. Ferguson E.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested (31Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev.

Nevertheless, ablation of the mouse Bmp1gene by homologous recombination (19Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) produced homozygous mutant embryos with defects in procollagen processing and fibrillogenesis, but with an absence of early patterning abnormalities. The phenotype of these mice thus suggests that in mammals BMP-1 functions primarily in the deposition of extracellular matrix rather than in embryonic patterning.Proteolytic cleavage of laminin was first noted by Ehrig et al. (20Ehrig K. Leivo I. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) for the laminin α2 chain. The cleavage occurs within the G domain of the chain, but the excised fragment remains covalently associated with the precursor molecule through a disulfide bond(s) (20Ehrig K. Leivo I. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing of laminin 5 was first identified by Rousselle et al. (21Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and subsequently characterized by Marinkovich et al. (1Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin 5 is a major component of the anchoring filaments within the dermal-epidermal junctional basement membrane of skin and plays an important role in stabilizing the attachment of epithelial hemidesmosomes to the basement membrane. Null mutations in the LAMA3, LAMB3, or LAMC2 genes encoding the laminin 5 chains result in the lethal blistering condition Herlitz's junctional epidermolysis bullosa (22Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Exp. Dermatol. 1996; 5: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Cultured keratinocytes synthesize an intracellular precursor of the tissue form that is composed of a laminin α3 (200 kDa), a β3 (140 kDa), and a γ2 (155 kDa) chain, but they do not synthesize significant amounts of other forms predicted (23Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. of Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Airenne T. Haakana H. Sainio K. Kallunki T. Kallunki P. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. Genomics. 1996; 32: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to arise via alternative splicing or via use of alternative promoters (1Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin 5 extracted from tissues is composed of α3 (165 or 145 kDa), β3 (140 kDa), and γ2 (105 kDa) chains. Approximately one-half of the laminin 5 extracted from tissue is covalently associated by disulfide bonds with laminin 6 (α3β1γ1) in skin and with laminin 6 and laminin 7(α3β2γ1) in amnion (25Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Kenne D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 719-728Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These associations may be mediated by cysteinyl residues predicted to be unpaired within the fourth EGF-like repeat of domain IIIa of α3 and within domain VI of β3. Recent evidence (26Rousselle P. Kenne D.R. Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. van der Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) suggests that monomeric laminin 5, but not complexed laminin 5, directly mediates the interactions of hemidesmosomal integrin α6β4 with the anchoring fibril protein type VII collagen. However, the role of the laminin 5–6/7 complexes are unclear. Monomeric laminin 5 is unable to interact with other known components of the basement membrane, because the processed molecule lacks the required VI domains of the short arms and the nidogen/entactin-binding domain identified within the γ1 chain (27Mayer U. Nischt R. Poschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1979; 12: 1879-1885Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar,28Mayer U. Poschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, complex formation of laminin 5 with laminins 6 or 7 provides a binding site for nidogen/entactin because of the presence of the γ1 chain. The complex, but not the monomer, is therefore predicted to be competent to participate in basement membrane assembly. Proteolytic processing within the short arms of the laminin α3 and γ2 chains is hypothesized to be required for complex formation, because the proteolytic events remove substantial portions of the γ2 short arm, thereby allowing access of the unpaired cysteinyl residue within the β3 domain VI to the unpaired cysteinyl residue within the IIIa domain of the α3 chain. The present studies support the above hypothesis by identifying the cleavage sites resulting from laminin 5 processing and identifying one of the proteolytic enzymes involved.MATERIALS AND METHODSKeratinocyte CultureHuman keratinocytes were cultured from newborn foreskins in serum free keratinocyte growth medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Dissociated third passage keratinocytes were used for experiments.Cell LabelingDissocated third passage keratinocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum overnight. Cells were briefly washed and then incubated for 30 min or 1 h with methionine- and cysteine-deficient DMEM. Labeling was performed in deficient medium containing 250 μCi/ml each of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min in pulse-chase experiments and in the deficient medium containing 50 μCi/ml each of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (25Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Kenne D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 719-728Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar) for 24 h in other experiments under standard culture conditions. Labeled medium was removed from culture plates and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm. Cell layers were washed once with nonradioactive culture medium and then harvested with a cell scraper and ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm n-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm1-methionine, 2 mm 1-cysteine, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.3% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 0.1% SDS. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Labeled cell material was solubilized in a Dounce homogenizer and clarified at 160,000 (g × min). To examine the effects of the proteinase inhibitors on laminin 5 processing, keratinocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum on membrane filters (0.4 μm, Transwell Insert) overnight. Cells were briefly washed and then incubated for 1 h with methionine and cysteine-deficient DMEM. Labeling was performed in each deficient medium containing 100 μCi/ml each of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 1 h. Labeled cells were preincubated in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without proteinase inhibitors for 30 min, and conditioned media were removed. Fresh DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without proteinase inhibitors was added, and 3 h later the conditioned media were collected from lower chambers and clarified at 160,000 g × min.AntibodiesThe following antibodies were used in these studies: polyclonal rabbit anti-laminin 5 (1Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); monoclonal anti-laminin α3, BM-165, and BM-4 (21Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar); and polyclonal rabbit anti-EHS tumor laminin (Sigma). Anti-BMP-1: A BMP-1 fusion protein was produced as described previously (2Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) from a 1040-base pair ApaI-HincII cDNA fragment subcloned into expression vector pRSET B (Invitrogen). The fusion protein, comprising human BMP-1 residues 197–543 (29Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar) fused to a polyhistidine domain, was purified on nickel-Sepharose (Invitrogen, Carlesbad, CA) followed by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant BMP-1 band was visualized with Coomassie Blue, excised, equilibrated with PBS, emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant, and injected subcutaneously into a New Zealand White rabbit. The rabbit was boosted twice at 4-week intervals with 150 μg of fusion protein per boost, prepared as just described but using Freund's incomplete adjuvant. For affinity purification, anti-serum was diluted 1:10 in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and passed through a column of the purified fusion protein coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing the column with 10 bed volumes of 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), bound antibody was eluted with 10 bed volumes of 100 mmglycine (pH 2.5). Antibody-containing pools were dialyzed against PBS with 0.2% sodium azide and then stored at −70 °C. Specificity of the affinity-purified antibody was ascertained by immunoblotting of medium samples from cultures of MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, as described (30Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), in which antibodies detected only 88- and 130-kDa bands corresponding to BMP-1 and mTLD (an alternatively spliced form of BMP-1), respectively.RadioimmunoprecipitationFor each sample, 10 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-laminin 5, polyclonal anti-EHS tumor laminin (Sigma), or monoclonal anti-laminin 5 antibodies were added to 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein G-Sepharose alone was used as the control. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for at least 1 h with mild agitation. The antibody-protein G-Sepharose complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 6550 g-min, washed once with RIPA buffer, and centrifuged again before use.Preclearing of each sample was accomplished by adding aliquots of labeled cell or medium supernatants to the centrifuged pellets of gelatin-Sepharose (0.1 ml of gel suspension/1 ml of sample). Each sample was vortexed briefly and then left on a rocking platform overnight. The mixture was then centrifuged at 160,000 g-min, and the supernatant was combined with a centrifuged pellet of protein G-Sepharose precomplexed with specific antibody. These were then incubated for 18 h on a rocking platform and then centrifuged at 2550 g-min. The supernatant was then removed, and the pellet was washed with RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS, briefly vortexed, and then recentrifuged. After five washes, the pellets were mixed with sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and recentrifuged, and the supernatant solution was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Heparin-Sepharose Affinity ChromatographyKeratinocytes were labeled in methionine- and cysteine-deficient DMEM containing 100 μCi/ml each of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 1 h under standard culture conditions. Labeled cells were cultured in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 4 h later the conditioned medium was collected and clarified (160,000 g-min). The conditioned medium was precleared with gelatin-Sepharose as described above and applied to a heparin-Sepharose affinity column (1 ml, HiTrap Heparin; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bound materials were eluted with with a step NaCl gradient of 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, and 1.5 mNaCl in PBS, and radioactivities of 1 ml fractions were determined. Laminin 5 was immunoprecipitated from each peak fraction with a mixture of monoclonal anti-laminin α3 (BM-165) and anti-laminin β3 (6F12) antibodies. The precipitation products from each of the indicated fractions were evaluated by SDS-5% PAGE followed by disulfide bond reduction and visualized by autoradiography.Preparation of Recombinant ProteinsrBMP-1To produce rBMP-1, a 2199-base pairSphl-Bgll cDNA fragment containing the full-length human BMP-1 coding sequence from clone KT11 was ligated into vector pBacPAK9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and recombined with Bsu361-digested BacPAK6 (CLONTECH) viral DNA by co-transfection into Sf21 insect cells. After 60–72 h, resultant virus was plaque-purified and amplified for 4 days on Sf21 monolayers in 10% fetal calf serum and Grace's medium (Sigma). Virus stocks were then reamplified in Sf21 suspension cultures in serum-free Sf-900 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 6 days, fresh cells were infected with reamplified virus and grown in fresh Sf21–900 medium, which was harvested for recombinant protein 4 days after infection. Sf21 cells infected with parental BacPAK viral stock, in which the polyhedrin promoter drives LacZ expression, were cultured to provide control media.Conditioned media from insect cells expressing recombinant proteins BMP-1 and β-galactosidase as control were dialyzed against enzyme assay buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% soy bean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.5) and then concentrated above 5-fold with Centricon filter units (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Medium was stored at −80 °C.r γ2 Short ArmThe short arm of γ2 was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. 1 μg of total RNA from cultured keratinocytes was reverse transcribed (CLONTECH). PCR was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (PfuTurbo DNA Polymerase; Stratagene) using the following primers on keratinocyte cDNA: sense primer 5′-dGAGGCTAGCAACCTCCAGGAGGGAAGTCTGTGAT; antisense primer 5′-dCTCGGATCCCTCCATTCTCTGAAGCTGCTGC (Genbank accession number: NM005562). The PCR product was agarose gel purified (Qiagen) and subcloned (rapid DNA ligation kit; Roche Diagnostics Gmbh) into a modified PCEP-4 (gift from Ernst Poeschl) expression vector with the following restriction enzymes:NheI and BamHI (Promega). For convenience, a six-histidine tag followed by a stop codon was introduced at the 3′ end adjacent to the BamHI site of the PCEP-4 vector. The ligated DNA was transformed into TOP 10 cells (Invitrogen). Plasmids were isolated from the bacteria (Qiagen) and sequenced with gene-specific primers (Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The γ2 short arm expression vector was transformed (FuGene; Roche Diagnostics Gmbh) into 293 EBNA cells (Invitrogen) and selected after 2 days with Puromycin (Sigma). The supernatant (DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium; Life Technologies, Inc.) of the stable transfected cells was collected (2 liters) and supplemented with 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After ammonium sulfate precipitation (45%), the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and then dialyzed against the binding buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). The dialyzed protein was applied onto a nickel charged chelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and washed with binding buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazol (10–80 mm imidazol). Finally, the γ2 short arm was eluted with the binding buffer containing 1 m imidazol and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl.In Vitro Processing Enzyme AssayLaminin 5The intracellular precursor form of laminin 5 was prepared from keratinocyte lysates. Keratinocytes were labeled with methionine- and cysteine-deficient keratinocyte growth medium containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 24 h under standard culture conditions. Labeled medium was removed, and cell layers were washed once with nonradioactive culture medium, and then keratinocytes were dissociated with trypsin-EDTA (25Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Kenne D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 719-728Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and harvested. After washing with PBS twice, cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS with a Dounce homogenizer and then clarified at 160,000 g-min. The cell lysate was precleared with gelatin-Sepharose as described above. Protein G-Sepharose was precomplexed with anti-laminin α3 monoclonal antibodies BM-165 and BM-4 and mixed with the cell lysate. These were incubated for 18 h on a rocking platform and then centrifuged at 2550 g-min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS, briefly vortexed and then harvested by centrifugation. After five washes, the pellets were mixed and washed three times with the enzyme assay buffer.Recombinant BMP-1 or recombinant β-glactosidase (120 μl each) were mixed with immunoprecipitated precursor form of laminin 5 and then incubated on a rocking platform at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 μl each) were taken at 0, 1, 3, 7, and 17 h, mixed with 5-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-5% PAGE. For inhibition assays,o-phenanthroline or EDTA was added to the assay buffer.r γ2 Short Arm4 μg of purified recombinant laminin 5 γ2-His chain was incubated with 0.5 μg of purified FLAG-tagged recombinant BMP-1 (prepared as described in Ref. 31Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev.

The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel and analyzed using the GelCode E-Zinc Reversible Stain Kit (Pierce) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal sequencing.Other MethodsN-terminal amino acid sequence determinations were performed upon proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride as previously reported (29Wozney J.M.

Fetal calf stomach skin was taken from a fetus determined by crown-rump measurements to be equivalent to the first to second trimester transition. Immunohistochemical localization of laminin 5 was done using polyclonal anti-laminin 5 and for BMP-1 using polyclonal anti-recombinant BMP-1 (see above) according to the protocols previously described (21Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe proteolytic processing of laminin 5 in vitro first occurs within domain G4. The eliminated fragment has not yet been identified, but it does not remain disulfide bonded to the major α3 fragment, in contrast to the laminin α2 cleavage product, which does remain covalently associated with processed α2 (20Ehrig K. Leivo I. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The loss of at least part of G4 and all of G5 restricts the ability of laminin 5 to bind heparin, consistent with the presence of a putative heparin-binding site in G5. The physiological significance of the loss of heparin binding is unclear, but because this cleavage occurs upon secretion and the fully processed molecule retains cell binding capacity, the lost fragment is not essential to cell binding.The second cleavage of α3, from 165 to 145 kDa (1Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), produces a new N-terminal sequence within EGF-like repeat 2 of domain IIIa, near the domain IIIa-II border, thus eliminating the bulk of the α3 short arm. The cleavage occurs between disulfide bonded cysteine pairs, so the two cleaved fragments are predicted to not be bridged by a disulfide bond. The 145-kDa α3 chain is in"

https://openalex.org/W1965635774,"Somatic mutations in mtDNA have recently been identified in colorectal tumours. Studies of oncocytic tumours have led to hypotheses which propose that defects in oxidative phosphorylation may result in a compensatory increase in mitochondrial replication and/or gene expression. Mutational analysis of mtDNA in thyroid neoplasia, which is characterised by increased numbers of mitochondria and is also one of the most common sites of oncocytic tumours. has been limited to date. Using the recently developed technique of two-dimensional gene scanning, we have successfully examined 21 cases of thyroid tumours, six cases of non-neoplastic thyroid pathology, 30 population controls, nine foetal thyroid tissues and nine foetal tissues of non-thyroid origin, either kidney or liver. We have identified three different somatic mutations (23%) in papillary thyroid carcinomas. In addition, we have found significant differential distributions of mtDNA sequence variants between thyroid carcinomas and controls. Interestingly, these variants appear to be more frequent in the genes which encode complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain compared to normal population controls. These findings suggest first, that somatic mtDNA mutations may be involved in thyroid tumorigenesis and second, that the accumulation of certain non-somatic variants may be related to tumour progression in the thyroid."

https://openalex.org/W2068251811,"Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is the inhibitory component of the troponin complex and is involved in the calcium control of heart muscle contraction. Recently, specific missense mutations of the cTnI gene (TNNI3) have been shown to cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We have analyzed the functional effects of two HCM mutations (R145G and R162W) using purified recombinant cTnI. Both mutations gave reduced inhibition of actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin ATPase, both in experiments using cTnI alone and in those using reconstituted human cardiac troponin under relaxing conditions. Both mutant troponin complexes also conferred increased calcium sensitivity of ATPase regulation. Studies on wild type/R145G mutant mixtures showed that the wild type phenotype was dominant in that the inhibition and the calcium sensitivity conferred by a 50:50 mixture was more similar to wild type than expected. Surface plasmon resonance-based assays showed that R162W mutant had an increased affinity for troponin C in the presence of calcium. This observation may contribute to the increased calcium sensitivity found with this mutant and also corroborates recent structural data. The observed decreased inhibition and increased calcium sensitivity suggest that these mutations may cause HCM via impaired relaxation rather than the impaired contraction seen with some other classes of HCM mutants. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is the inhibitory component of the troponin complex and is involved in the calcium control of heart muscle contraction. Recently, specific missense mutations of the cTnI gene (TNNI3) have been shown to cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

Both mutations gave reduced inhibition of actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin ATPase, both in experiments using cTnI alone and in those using reconstituted human cardiac troponin under relaxing conditions. Both mutant troponin complexes also conferred increased calcium sensitivity of ATPase regulation. Studies on wild type/R145G mutant mixtures showed that the wild type phenotype was dominant in that the inhibition and the calcium sensitivity conferred by a 50:50 mixture was more similar to wild type than expected. Surface plasmon resonance-based assays showed that R162W mutant had an increased affinity for troponin C in the presence of calcium. This observation may contribute to the increased calcium sensitivity found with this mutant and also corroborates recent structural data. The observed decreased inhibition and increased calcium sensitivity suggest that these mutations may cause HCM via impaired relaxation rather than the impaired contraction seen with some other classes of HCM mutants. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cardiac troponin I troponin C troponin T tropomyosin dithiothreitol 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid subfragment 1 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)1 is an autosomal dominant disease of the myocardium. Patients present with a wide range of symptoms including chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, stroke, and sudden death (1.Maron B.J. Gardin J.M. Flack J.M. Gidding S.S. Kurosaki T.T. Bild D.E. Circulation. 1995; 92: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). The affected heart shows increased left ventricular mass, myocyte hypertrophy and disarray, and fibrosis. The first HCM-causing mutation to be reported was the R403Q missense mutation in the β-myosin heavy chain gene (2.Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Kass S. Tanigawa G. Vosberg H.P. McKenna W. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 999-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar); further mutations have since been found in this gene and in 8 other genes all of which encode sarcomeric proteins (3.Bonne G. Carrier L. Richard P. Hainque B. Schwartz K. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 580-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 4.Redwood C.S. Moolman-Smook J.C. Watkins H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Investigations into the functional abnormalities of the HCM mutant proteins have suggested that the end stage disease is the result of numerous different effects: some mutations result in diminished contractility (for example, mutations at Arg403in β myosin heavy chain), some in decreased calcium sensitivity while others enhance contractility or calcium sensitivity (4.Redwood C.S. Moolman-Smook J.C. Watkins H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In 1997, Kimura et al. (5.Kimura A. Harada H. Park J.-E. Nishi H. Satoh M. Takahashi M. Hiroi S. Sasaoka T. Ohbuchi N. Nakamura T. Koyanagi T. Hwang T. Choo J. Chung K. Hasegawa A. Nagai R. Okazaki O. Nakamura H. Matsuzaki M. Sakamoto T. Toshima H. Koga Y. Imaizumi T. Sasazuki T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) were the first to report HCM-causing mutations in the cardiac troponin I (cTnI) gene (TNNI3). Five missense mutations (R145G, R145Q, R162W, G203S, and K206Q) were reported along with a mutation causing the deletion of one codon (Lys183). Troponin I (TnI) is the inhibitory component of the troponin complex and is involved in the Ca2+ regulation of muscle contraction in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. The protein forms a 1:1:1 complex with troponin C (TnC) and troponin T (TnT) which binds to the thin filament via interactions with both actin and tropomyosin (TM). The binding of Ca2+by TnC causes a conformational change in the complex which results in a shift in the position of TM with respect to the actin helix, allowing strong force-generating interactions between actin and myosin (6.Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 7.Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The precise structure of the complex has yet to be elucidated, although the structure of isolated TnC is known (8.Herzberg O. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 761-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Low resolution studies and biochemical data have shown that TnI and TnC bind strongly to form an antiparallel dimer with multiple interaction sites (9.Olah G.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12800-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10.Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H. da Silva A.C. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human cTnI gene encodes a protein of 210 amino acids (11.Vallins W.J. Brand N.J. Dabhade N. Butler Browne G. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) which is the sole TnI isoform expressed in adult heart. cTnI has considerable homology to the skeletal muscle isoform, the principal difference between the two being a 30-residue N-terminal extension of the cardiac protein which contains 2 serines, the phosphorylation of which by cAMP-dependent protein kinase is known to regulate cTnI function. The most important functional sequence of cTnI is a short central stretch of residues referred to as the inhibitory region, required for the inhibition of actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase. This sequence also binds to TnC in the presence of Ca2+ and as an isolated peptide is capable of the inhibition of actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase and the relaxation of skinned muscle fibers, both of which can be relieved by the addition of TnC in the presence of activating concentrations of Ca2+ (12.Cachia P.J. Van Eyk J. Ingraham R.H. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3553-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13.Van Eyk J.E. Strauss J.D. Hodges R.S. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The minimum inhibitory sequence consists of residues 137 to 148 in the human cardiac protein (104 to 115 in rabbit skeletal muscle TnI). Further studies on skeletal TnI peptides have revealed a “second actin-TM-binding site” (161 to 181 in human cTnI), necessary for enhanced inhibition compared with that achieved with the minimum sequence, and a region critical for the interaction with TnC (149 to 164, a putative “second TnC-binding site”) (14.Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Analysis of truncation mutants has shown that in the case of cTnI, additional C-terminal residues (amino acids 187–198 in the human cardiac sequence) influence actin binding and inhibition (15.Rarick H.M. Tu X.-H. Solaro R.J. Martin A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26887-26892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Perturbation of TnI function has been linked to myocardial stunning in which reversible cardiac dysfunction takes place. This phenomenon has been shown to be caused by proteolysis of TnI, initially producing a fragment missing the C-terminal 17 amino acids, and concomitant alteration in thin filament regulation (16.McDonough J.L. Arrell D.K. Van Eyk J.E. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that transgenic mice expressing this 1–193 truncated protein at 9–17% of the level of endogenous TnI, developed ventricular dilatation, diminished myocyte contractility, and reduced myofilament calcium responsiveness (17.Murphy A.M. Kogler H. Georgakopoulos D. McDonough J.L. Kass D.A. Van Eyk J.E. Marban E. Science. 2000; 287: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The vital importance of the cardiac isoform has also been emphasized by the severe phenotype of a cTnI knockout mouse (18.Huang X. Pi Y. Lee K.J. Henkel A.S. Gregg R.G. Powers P.A. Walker J.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In order to understand how subtle alterations in troponin I cause disease, we have used purified recombinant human cTnI to compare thein vitro function of wild type TnI with two HCM TnI mutants, one containing the R145G mutation, the other R162W. R145G is one of the two reported HCM mutations that change residue Arg145 in the inhibitory region and the R162W mutation causes a charge change to a residue located in the overlap between the second TnC-binding site and second actin-TM-binding site as defined by Tripet et al. (14.Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The functional abnormalities revealed, namely reduced ability to inhibit actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase and an increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase regulation, suggest that these mutations may result in relaxation abnormalities in vivo. In addition, the finding that the R162W mutant has an increased affinity for TnC supports recent structural data concerning the interaction of these two proteins. Human cTnI cDNA (11.Vallins W.J. Brand N.J. Dabhade N. Butler Browne G. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), obtained as a gift from Dr. P. Barton (Imperial College, London, United Kingdom), was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to introduce the silent mutations in codons 2 and 4 suggested by al Hillawi et al. (19.al Hillawi E. Minchin S.D. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The product was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pMW172 (20.Way M. Gooch J. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) usingNdeI and HindIII. The TnI sequence was altered using a two-step polymerase chain reaction-based oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis protocol to produce the R145G and R162W HCM mutations. The TnI constructs were overexpressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (21.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar), and the cells lysed after freeze-thawing in buffer containing 5 m urea. Both wild type and mutant TnI were purified from the extract using cationic exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Human cardiac TnT (22.Redwood C.S. Lohmann K. Bing W. Esposito G. Elliott K. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Purcell I. Marston S.B. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and TnC (19.al Hillawi E. Minchin S.D. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified as described previously. The pET11c construct encoding human cardiac TnC was obtained as a gift from Prof. I. Trayer (Birmingham, UK). Recombinant human cardiac troponin was reconstituted by mixing a 1.5:1:1 molar ratio of recombinant troponins C, I, and T. The protein was diluted to 0.75 mg/ml using buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% sodium azide, 50 μmCaCl2, 6 m urea, and 1 m KCl. The concentrations of urea and KCl were decreased using a stepwise dialysis protocol and the proteins were finally dialyzed into 5 mmPIPES, pH 7.0, 3.87 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT (“ATPase buffer”). Aggregated protein was removed by centrifugation at 12,300 × g for 10 min and the troponin was concentrated using Centricon 10 concentrators. The composition of the reconstituted troponin complex was determined by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining and scanning densitometry (22.Redwood C.S. Lohmann K. Bing W. Esposito G. Elliott K. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Purcell I. Marston S.B. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Wild type complex was found to be close to 1:1:1 with respect to the three subunits (TnT:TnI:TnC was 1:0.95:1.12 (n = 3)) and the mutant complexes were shown to be indistinguishable from wild type. Although not routinely used, gel filtration chromatography was used to show that this reconstitution method using either wild type or mutant TnI resulted in a single species (the 1:1:1 complex). Myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) and F-actin from rabbit fast skeletal muscle and α-TM from rabbit cardiac muscle were prepared by standard methods (23.Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 24.Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 25.Eisenberg E. Kielley W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4742-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All protein concentrations were determined using a standard colorimetric assay (26.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). Actin-TM-activated myosin S-1 ATPase rates were measured using 0.5 μm rabbit skeletal myosin S-1, 7 μm rabbit skeletal actin, and 1 μm rabbit α-TM in ATPase buffer containing 3 mm ATP at 37 °C in the presence of 0–4 μm TnI or 0–2 μmtroponin complex. For the titration of troponin under activating or relaxing conditions, assays were carried out at pCa 4.5 or 8.5. For the study of Ca2+ dependence of ATPase, assays were carried out in the presence of 2 μm troponin at a range of pCa values between 4.5 and 8.5. The free Ca2+ concentration was set using 1 mm EGTA and the appropriate concentration of CaCl2 as determined using the WINMAXC program (27.Bers D. Patton C. Nutticelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 40: 1-94Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid and the amount of phosphate released measured by the method of Taussky and Schorr (28.Taussky H.H. Schorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each assay was carried out in triplicate and on at least three separate preparations of TnI. 7 μm rabbit skeletal actin and 1 μm rabbit α-TM were mixed in ATPase buffer in the presence of 0–2 μm TnI or 0–2 μm troponin complex and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 313,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C (Beckman TLA-100 rotor) to pellet the actin-TM filaments. Samples of the mixture prior to centrifugation and the supernatant and pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel; protein was stained using Coomassie Blue. Under these conditions >95% of the actin was found in the pellet and <10% of the TnI or troponin complex sedimented alone. TnI-TnC binding was investigated using a BIAcore-X in an assay based on the method of Reiffert et al. (29.Reiffert S.U. Jacquet K. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Herberg F.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13516-13525Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). TnC was labeled with biotin by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with a 3-fold molar excess of 6-(biotinamidocaproylamido)-caproic acidN-hydroxy-succinimide ester (Sigma) in 20 mmNaHCO3. Excess uncomplexed biotin was removed by extensive dialysis against 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.3 m KCl, and 1 mm DTT. Biotin incorporation was determined using the protocol supplied with HABA/Avidin reagent (Sigma). Biotinylated TnC was coupled to one flow cell of a BIAcore SA chip as previously detailed and sensorgrams showing the specific interaction of TnI with TnC were generated by subtraction of a second flow cell response (lacking captured TnC) from this test cell response. 100-s injections of 25–500 nm TnI in 20 mm MOPS, pH 8.0, 0.5m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT (“Binding buffer”), with either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA, were made at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The dissociation phase was allowed to proceed for a further 100 s. The chip surface was regenerated with 60-s injections of 20 mm MOPS, pH 8.0, 6 murea, 1 m KCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 2 mmEGTA and 2 mm DTT. Using the BIAEvaluation software, portions of the dissociation and association phases equivalent to those used by Reiffert et al. (29.Reiffert S.U. Jacquet K. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Herberg F.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13516-13525Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were analyzed to derive estimates of the dissociation rate constant (k d) and the association rate constant (k a) assuming simple 1:1 kinetics. The association equilibrium constant (K a) was then calculated (K a =k a/k d). Data sets were analyzed to give mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the GraphPad InStat software. The Newman-Keuls post-test was used to compare pairs of group means. Values were defined as statistically significantly different with p values <0.05. The inhibition of actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase conferred by wild type and mutant TnI was compared. Addition of wild type TnI to myosin-actin-α-TM caused a decrease of 70% in the ATPase rate at 37 °C with saturation of inhibition at 2 μm TnI and an EC50 of inhibition of 0.8 μm. Both R145G and R162W TnI mutants were less effective inhibitors, with EC50 of inhibition of 1.4 and 1.5 μm, respectively, although the saturating levels of inhibition for both were similar to wild type (Fig.1 A). We analyzed whether these differences in inhibition were due to reduced binding of the mutant TnI to actin-TM. In sedimentation assays performed under ATPase conditions we found that wild type TnI and both mutants bound tightly to actin-TM; Fig. 1 B shows that for wild type, R145G and R162W, each at 2 μm, >95% of the TnI was present in the pellet. This result shows that the large differences in the potency of inhibition conferred by wild type and mutant TnI in this assay are not caused by weaker binding of the TnI to actin-TM. Troponin complexes were reconstituted as described using purified recombinant human cardiac isoforms of TnC, TnT, and either wild type or mutant TnI. The final subunit compositions of each reconstituted troponin determined by SDS-PAGE were identical. The Ca2+ regulation of actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase conferred by wild type and mutant complexes was compared. In activating Ca2+ conditions (pCa 4.5) addition of wild type complex to myosin-actin-α-TM caused an increase of over 100% in the ATPase rate at 37 °C; addition of troponin containing R145G or R162W mutant TnI was found to give indistinguishable activation (Fig.2 A). At pCa 8.5, wild type troponin inhibited the actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase by 60%; however, under these conditions, it was found that the R162W mutant complex gave only 25% inhibition compared with wild type and the R145G mutant complex gave little or no inhibition (Fig.2 A). As with TnI alone, sedimentation assays were used to show that the differences in inhibition were not caused by a difference in binding of the wild type and mutant complexes to actin-TM (Fig.2IB). Further experiments using thin filament concentrations 2-fold lower (3.5 μm) and 2-fold higher (14 μm) confirmed that the percentage inhibition conferred by both wild type and mutant troponin at pCa 8.5 was independent of thin filament concentration. HCM is an autosomal dominant disease and affected individuals have one wild type copy and one mutant copy of a particular contractile protein gene. It is likely that in the hearts of those carrying a HCM cTnI mutation both wild type and mutant TnI proteins are expressed and incorporated into troponin complex. There are no reports of the determination of the in vivoproportion of cTnI protein that is mutant but it is unlikely to be more than 50% of the total. Recent analysis of the function of a cardiac TnT HCM mutant in the in vitro motility assay has suggested that the behavior of troponin mixtures containing 50% or less mutant complex cannot necessarily be predicted from the study of 100% mutant and 100% wild type preparations (22.Redwood C.S. Lohmann K. Bing W. Esposito G. Elliott K. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Purcell I. Marston S.B. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus we have investigated the effect of troponin complex containing different wild type:mutant ratios on actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase at pCa 8.5 (Fig.3). The response to increasing the proportion of R145G TnI troponin containing from 0 to 100% was clearly not linear: the transition from 0 to 50% mutant was accompanied by an increase of the rate from 38 to 51% of actin-TM-activated ATPase whereas the ATPase rose by almost 4 times as much (from 51 to 102%) as the proportion of mutant rose from 50 to 100%. The data obtained using mixtures of wild type and R162W TnI containing complexes showed a less clear biphasic relationship between ATPase and proportion of mutant troponin and could also be adequately fitted to a straight line. Experiments were also carried out using 1 μm total troponin to ensure that the nonlinear relationship was not due to the displacement of mutant troponin complex by wild type troponin complex. Under these conditions >95% of the troponin was bound to actin-TM (Fig. 2 B). The biphasic relationship in the wild type/R145G troponin titration was still clearly seen (data not shown). The Ca2+ regulation of actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase by wild type troponin, mutant troponin, and mixtures of 50% wild type, 50% mutant troponin were compared using a constant concentration of troponin in buffers of pCa from 4.5 to 8.5. Indistinguishable ΔpCa50 values were obtained using either 1 μm (data not shown) or 2 μm(Fig. 4) total troponin. The Ca2+ regulation conferred by wild type troponin was shown to have a pCa50 of 6.26 ± 0.03. Troponin containing R145G TnI was found to have greatly increased Ca2+ sensitivity of regulation (ΔpCa50 = +0.56 ± 0.03;p < 0.001); the 50:50 mixture of wild type and R145G troponin also showed an increased calcium sensitivity with a ΔpCa50 = +0.17 ± 0.03 (p< 0.001). An increased calcium sensitivity of a smaller magnitude (ΔpCa50 = +0.13 ± 0.03;p < 0.05) was shown by troponin complex containing R162W TnI. Again, the 50:50 mixture of wild type and mutant showed a Ca2+ sensitivity lying between that of 100% wild type and 100% mutant (ΔpCa50 = +0.08 ± 0.04), although statistical analysis showed that this increased sensitivity was not significantly different from either 100% wild type or 100% R162W (p > 0.05). The interaction of TnI with immobilized TnC was analyzed in real time using a surface plasmon resonance based assay (29.Reiffert S.U. Jacquet K. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Herberg F.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13516-13525Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant TnC was biotinylated and bound to a BIAcore SA chip. The binding of wild type TnI and each mutant was measured over a range of concentrations in buffer containing either 0.1 mmCaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. A set of binding curves for wild TnI in 0.1 mm CaCl2 is shown in Fig.5 A. By analysis of the association and dissociation phases of the binding curves, estimates of the association (k a) and dissociation (k d) rate constants and the association equilibrium constant (K a) were obtained. TheK a values obtained in the presence and absence of Ca2+ using wild type TnI (1.61 × 108m−1 and 7.34 × 107m−1, respectively) were very similar to those obtained in a solution binding assay using fluorescently labeled TnC (1.27 × 108m−1 and 4.17 × 107m−1, respectively) (30.Liao R. Wang C.K. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12729-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The binding of R145G TnI to TnC under both conditions was shown to be indistinguishable from that of wild type (Fig. 5 B and TableI). However, the binding of R162W to TnC in 0.1 mm CaCl2 was found to be significantly stronger (K a increased 2.6 times) due to a markedly slower dissociation rate although the k a was found to be the same as wild type (Fig. 5 C and Table I). A small, but not significant, difference in binding of R162W TnI to TnC in 1 mm EGTA was found (K a increased 1.3 times) (Table I).Table IThe calculated association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants and the association equilibrium constant (Ka) for the binding of wild type and mutant TnI to TnCTroponin ICa2+k a/105m−1s−1k d/10−3s−1K a/108m−1nWild type4.033 ± 0.6162.494 ± 0.2651.611 ± 0.1506R145G4.124 ± 0.7332.618 ± 0.5871.53 ± 0.2023R162W3.397 ± 0.6250.833 ± 0.203 aSignificant difference from wild type value measured under the same conditions (p< 0.01).4.157 ± 0.815 aSignificant difference from wild type value measured under the same conditions (p< 0.01).4Troponin IMg2+k a/105m−1s−1k d/10−3s−1K a/108m−1nWild type3.728 ± 0.5405.087 ± 0.2970.734 ± 0.0974R145G4.222 ± 0.3875.346 ± 0.5010.814 ± 0.1063R162W3.523 ± 0.3203.783 ± 0.3890.945 ± 0.0763Data are shown as mean ± S.E.a Significant difference from wild type value measured under the same conditions (p< 0.01).

This study of the in vitro properties of two human cTnI mutants that cause HCM has yielded information on the structure-function of TnI while also revealing functional differences between mutant and wild type protein that may underlie the pathogenesis of the disease. Both the R145G and R162W mutants were shown to be less potent inhibitors of actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase than wild type TnI, with the EC50 of inhibition of both mutants approximately double that of wild type TnI (Fig. 1 A). This was not a consequence of weaker binding of the mutant TnI and hence is a primary effect of both mutations on TnI function. The equivalent of the R145G mutation in a 12-mer skeletal muscle TnI inhibitory peptide caused a much more profound decrease in the potency of inhibition (31.Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol.

However, two single amino acid substitutions within the inhibitory region of full-length rabbit skeletal muscle TnI were both found to give similar reductions in the potency of TnI inhibition to that reported here for the two HCM mutants (32.Van Eyk J.E. Thomas L.T. Tripet B. Wiesner R.J. Pearlstone J.R. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the results obtained with peptide and full-length protein probably reflects the influence of residues outside of this region in stabilizing the binding of the minimal inhibitory sequence. Decreased inhibitory properties of a full-length TnI with a single amino acid substitution outside of the inhibitory region have not been previously reported. However, in a peptide equivalent to residues 129 to 181 in the cardiac protein, the triple mutation of the equivalent of Lys174, Lys177, and Lys178 to Ala produced a similar reduced potency of inhibition as observed in this study with the R162W mutant (14.Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Titration of actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase activity with whole troponin revealed activation at pCa 4.5 similar to wild type but significant differences in regulation between wild type and mutant troponin at pCa 8.5. R145G TnI gave 0% inhibition at saturation compared with 60% for wild type whereas the R162W mutant inhibited by 25% (Fig. 2). These data contrast with the inhibition obtained with TnI alone in that the differences between wild type and mutant are considerably more profound and they are present at the saturated levels of inhibition. The characteristics of complex containing R145G TnI (normal activation at pCa 4.5 and the lack of inhibition at pCa 8.5) are very similar to the properties we find of troponin containing a human cardiac TnT HCM mutant which lacks the C-terminal 28 amino acids (22.Redwood C.S.

This gene encodes a novel Rho GTP-binding protein and is specifically expressed in hematopoietic tissues. We made its precise mapping at band 4p13, and described its partial genomic structure. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular analyses, we report here on the rearrangement of the RhoH/TTF gene, at band 4p13, in four cases of NHL with t(3;4)(q27;p13) translocation and its fusion to the LAZ3/BCL6 gene at band 3q27, in three of these cases. RT-PCR analysis of two cases allowed the detection of variable fusion transcripts emerging from the rearranged alleles, and in one case, a deregulated expression of both RhoH/TTF and LAZ3/BCL6 genes, by promoter substitution, was observed. We also show here another rearrangement of the RhoH/TTF gene in a patient with multiple myeloma and t(4;14)(p13;q32) translocation, with breakage within the IGH gene. It is the first report which describes the recurrent chromosomal alteration of a GTP-binding protein encoding gene, in patients with hematopoietic malignancies."

The gene responsible for Werner's syndrome encodes a protein that has a helicase domain homologous toEscherichia coli RecQ. To identify binding partners that regulate the function in concert with Wrn, we screened for proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system with mouse Wrn as bait and found three. One was a novel protein, and the other two were mouse Ubc9 and SUMO-1. Ubc9 also interacted with the mouse homologue of the Bloom's syndrome gene product, another eukaryotic RecQ-type helicase, but not mouse DNA helicase Q1/RecQL (RecQL1). Deletion experiments indicated that both proteins interacted with the N-terminal segment of Wrn (amino acid 272–514). The interaction between Wrn and SUMO-1 was weaker than that between Wrn and Ubc9. Positive interaction was observed in the heterogeneous combination of Wrn and yeast Ubc9 (yUbc9), as well as yUbc9 and SUMO-1, in the two-hybrid system. The interaction between yUbc9 and SUMO-1 was abolished by deleting the C-terminal Gly residue of SUMO-1, which is reportedly required for the formation of Ubc9-SUMO-1 thioester linkage. The interaction of Wrn and SUMO-1 was also abolished by deleting the Gly residue, indicating that the interaction of Wrn and SUMO-1 is mediated by yUbc9 in the two-hybrid system.

Werner's syndrome human mouse polymerase chain reaction yeast Gal4-DNA binding domain Gal4-DNA activation domain Werner's syndrome (WS),1 a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is a potential model of accelerated human aging.

Therefore, the clinical features and cellular phenotypes of most WS patients are due to an absolute lack of Wrn helicase in the nucleus. Cells derived from WS patients show chromosome instability, a shorter life span in in vitro culture (16.Martin G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1977; 89: 484-511PubMed Google Scholar), and accelerated telomere shortening (17.Schulz V.P. Zakian V.A. Ogburn C.E. McKay J. Jarzebowicz A.A. Edland S.D. Martin G.M. Hum.

In addition, a large number of reports have shown that many cellular events including DNA repair, transcription, and apoptosis are affected in WS cells (19.Ogburn C.E. Oshima J. Poot M. Chen R.

In addition, it was reported that Wrn is able to interact with replication protein A, PCNA, and DNA topoisomerase I, suggesting that Wrn plays some role in DNA replication (23.Brosh Jr., R.M.

Despite these observations, it is not clear how the dysfunction of Wrn is related to the observed phenotypes of cells derived from WS patients. To obtain further insight into the process in which Wrn is involved, we tried to isolate cDNAs encoding proteins that interacted with mouse Wrn by using the yeast two-hybrid system. We identified the following three mouse proteins: a novel protein (Whip; Wernerhelicase interacting protein), Ubc9, and SUMO-1. Ubc9 was originally believed to be involved in the conjugation of ubiquitin (27.Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) but now is known to be involved in SUMO-1 conjugation (28.Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

The yeast strains used were HF7c (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::[GAL4 17-mers]3-CYC1-lacZ) and Y190 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4D, gal80D, cyhr2, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3-HIS3, URA3::GAL1-GAL1-lacZ). The shuttle vectors, pGBT9 and pGAD424, were purchased from CLONTECH. The expression vector, pCMV5-FLAG (pFLAG), was a gift from Dr. S. Hosino, Tokyo University, Japan. We cloned mouse WrncDNA encoding a 1401-amino acid protein (31.Imamura O. Ichikawa K. Yamabe Y. Goto M. Sugawara M. Furuichi Y. Genomics. 1997; 41: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The WrncDNA in pGME-T-Easy vector (Promega) was digested withBglII and SalI and then blunted by treating with Klenow fragment. The bait plasmid, pGBT9-mWRN-F (mWRN), was constructed by inserting the full-length Wrn cDNA in-frame at the blunted SalI site of pGBT9. Variously truncatedWrn cDNA were prepared by PCR using appropriate primers on a plasmid containing the full-length Wrn cDNA and subcloned into pGBT9. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. pGBT9-mouse BLM (mBLM), pGBT9-mouse RecQL1α (mQL1α), and pGBT9-mouse RecQL1β (mQL1β) were constructed as described previously (32.Seki T. Wang W.S. Okumura N. Seki M. Katada T. Enomoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33.Wang W.S. Seki M. Yamaoka T. Seki T. Tada S. Katada T. Fujimoto H. Enomoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The full-length Wrn cDNA was digested with BglII and SalI and subcloned into pFLAG to generate the N-terminal FLAG-tagged Wrn (pFLAG-mWRN). Budding yeast genomic UBC9 DNA was amplified by PCR and was inserted into pGEM-T-Easy vector. To obtain yUBC9 cDNA, it is necessary to remove the intron sequence from the genomic DNA. TheyUBC9 exon 2 was amplified by PCR on pGEM-T-genomicyUBC9. The exon 2 DNA was linked with the 90-mer linker containing whole exon 1 and a 38-base exon 2 sequence by PCR. The full-length yUBC9 cDNA was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy vector and verified by DNA sequencing. The XhoI fragment ofyUBC9 cDNA was inserted into the SalI site of the pGBT9 or pGAD424 vector. Full-length mouse SUMO-1 cDNA and the deletion mutant of the C-terminal Gly residue of SUMO-1 (lacking the C-terminal sequence, GHSTV) were amplified by PCR on pACT-mSUMO-1 using primers (pACT-5′, GATGATGAAGATACCCCACC and pACT-3′, ATTGAGATGGTGCACGATGC or mSUMO-1 GE, GTCTCGAGTCACCCCGTTTGTTCCTG) and digested with XhoI. The XhoI fragment of SUMO-1 constructs was inserted into pGBT9 and pACT vector. Yeast cells (strain HF7c) containing the bait plasmid pGBT9-mWRN-F were transformed with a mouse lymphoma cDNA library (CLONTECH) for two-hybrid assay using the lithium acetate method. Approximately 2.3 × 106 transformants were selected for growth on SD plates lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. The colonies grown on the SD plates were subsequently analyzed for β-galactosidase activity by filter assay, and 50 β-galactosidase-positive clones were obtained. By comparing restriction patterns of PCR products, the positive clones were categorized into 3 groups, Whip (20 clones),Ubc9 (29 clones), and SUMO-1 (1 clone). pGBT9-mWRN-F and pACT-WHIP, -UBC9, or -SUMO-1 were transformed into strain Y190, and their interaction was examined. Plasmids were transformed into E. coliHB101 cells by electroporation, and the cells were grown on ampicillin (+) plates. Ampicillin-resistant clones were streaked on leucine (−) M9 plates. The pACT plasmids containing Whip,Ubc9, or SUMO-1 were obtained by the standard method from ampicillin-resistant and leucine (+) colonies and then sequenced. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed according to the CLONTECH manual. The β-galactosidase activity was as follows: Miller unit = 1000 × A 420/(t × V ×A 600), where t = reaction time (min), and V = assay volume (ml). 293EBNA cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were grown to 70% confluence in 10-cm dishes and transfected with plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected 293EBNA cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 4 × radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 4% Nonidet P-40, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.4% SDS, 2 mm dithiothreitol), and sonicated on ice. The cell lysate was diluted with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide and COMPLETE protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and stood for 20 min on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged. The resultant supernatant was incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Eastman Kodak Co.), which had been preincubated with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. The anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel was precipitated by centrifugation, and the precipitate was washed three times with 1 × radioimmune precipitation buffer and then suspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were fractionated in 6% SDS polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG (SIGMA) or anti-SUMO-1(Zymed Laboratories Inc.) antibody followed by the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (DAKO). Bands were visualized using ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The yeast two-hybrid system was used to isolate cDNA-encoding polypeptides that interact with mWrn. We screened 2.3 × 106 transformants derived from a mouse lymphoma cDNA library and identified 50 positive clones, which were categorized into 3 different groups, Whip (20 clones), which encodes a novel protein (to be published elsewhere), Ubc9(29 clones), and SUMO-1 (1 clone). Mouse SUMO-1 is 100% identical to hSUMO-1 at the amino acid level, and 48% identical to Smt3 (SUMO-1 homologue of budding yeast). It has been established that Ubc9 acts to conjugate SUMO-1 to other proteins (28.Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 29.Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We examined the interaction of Ubc9 with other RecQ family proteins and found that Ubc9 is able to interact with the mouse Bloom's syndrome gene product (Blm) but not mouse RecQL1α or RecQL1β (Fig.1). To map the Wrn domains that bind to Ubc9 and SUMO-1, we generated deletion mutants and assayed transcriptional activity using the two-hybrid system (Fig. 2). The N-terminal fragment (amino acid 1–514) interacted with both Ubc9 and SUMO-1, but the C-terminal fragment (amino acid 514–1401) did not. A higher level of transcriptional activity was observed with the fragment (amino acid 272–514) containing the repeat sequence and the acidic domain. A considerable level of promoter activity was observed with the fragment (amino acid 272–416) lacking the repeat sequence and the acidic domain. Weak promoter activity was detected after introduction of the fragment containing the repeat sequence and the acidic domain of Wrn; however, this fragment caused high background. Thus we concluded that Ubc9 and SUMO-1 interact with the N-terminal segment of Wrn (amino acid 272–514). It is worth noting that the transcriptional activity due to the interaction between Ubc9 and Wrn or its fragments is always higher than that due to the interaction between SUMO-1 and each of the corresponding Wrn polypeptides. It is conceivable that the weak interaction between SUMO-1 and Wrn is mediated by yeast Ubc9. Thus, the interaction between Wrn and yUbc9 and that between yUbc9 and SUMO-1 were examined. Weak but significant levels of transcription were observed in both cases (Table I).Table IInteraction between Wrn and yUbc9 and between yUbc9 and SUMO-1AD.B.D.D.A.D.β-Galactosidase activitymWRN-FpGAD0.155mUBC98.099mSUMO-10.600mSUMO-1 G960.135yUBC90.593BD.B.D.D.A.D.mUBC9mSUMO-1mSUMO-1 G96pGADmUBC9NDblue (5.15)white (0.05)white (0.13)mSUMO-1blue (5.15)NDNDwhite (0.11)mSUMO-1 G96white (0.05)NDNDwhite (0.00)yUBC9NDblue (0.46)white (0.14)white (0.11)pGBDwhite (0.09)white (0.15)white (0.15)white (0.10)A, yeast cells (strain Y190) were transformed with pGBT9-mWRN-F and pACT-mUBC9, pACT-mSUMO-1, pACT-mSUMO-1 G96, or pGAD424-yUBC9 and assayed for β-galactosidase activity.

Open table in a new tab A, yeast cells (strain Y190) were transformed with pGBT9-mWRN-F and pACT-mUBC9, pACT-mSUMO-1, pACT-mSUMO-1 G96, or pGAD424-yUBC9 and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. B, yeast cells (strain Y190) were transformed with the indicated combination of plasmids and assayed for β-galactosidase activity by filter and liquid assays. It has been reported that on deletion of the conserved C-terminal Gly-Gly residues of hSUMO-1, hUbc9-SUMO-1 thioester linkage in anin vitro reticulocyte system, as well as two-hybrid interaction between hUbc9 and hSUMO-1 in yeast cells, was abolished (29.Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As expected, the deletion of the C-terminal Gly residue abolished the interaction between mUbc9 and mSUMO-1 in yeast cells, because the amino acids sequences of these protein are the same as those of the human counterparts (Table I B). In addition, the interaction between yUbc9 and SUMO-1 was also abolished by deleting the C-terminal Gly residue of SUMO-1. Thus, if the interaction between Wrn and SUMO-1 is mediated by yUbc9, it is quite possible that the interaction between Wrn and SUMO-1 is abolished by deleting the C-terminal Gly residue. As shown in Table I A, this was the case. It is interesting to know whether Wrn itself is conjugated with SUMO-1. FLAG-tagged Wrn was expressed in human 293EBNA cells, and immunoprecipitants were prepared using an anti-FLAG antibody. Whole cell extracts and immunoprecipitants were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig.3 A, several higher molecular weight bands of Wrn were detected, and these bands were proven to indeed be Wrn conjugated with SUMO-1 by Western blotting using an anti-SUMO-1 antibody (Fig. 3 B). Among the proteins that have been shown to interact with UBC9 or SUMO-1 by the yeast two hybrid assay, PML, IκBα, p53, and HIPK2 have been confirmed to be conjugated with SUMO-1 in the cell (35.Sternsdorf T.

We have used this assay to test an auto-inhibitory model for the interaction of an NLS with the NLS receptor complex.

Consistent with this model, NLS substrates bind tightly to an N-terminally truncated importin α lacking the auto-inhibitory domain (K d ∼10 nm), but measurable binding to full-length importin α is only observed upon addition of importin β. Our quantitative results support the auto-inhibitory model and suggest a mechanism for a switch between a cytoplasmic, high affinity and a nuclear, low affinity NLS receptor.

Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). The monopartite NLS is exemplified by the NLS of SV40 large T-antigen (126PKKKRKV132), whereas the bipartite, consisting of two small clusters of basic residues separated by a linker sequence, is found in the NLS of nucleoplasmin (155KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK170) (2.Kalderon D.

Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). A heterodimeric receptor for the classical nuclear protein import pathway has been identified. This receptor consists of two proteins referred to as importin α and importin β (4.Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). The molecular and biochemical characterization of importin α shows that it recognizes and binds directly to the NLS peptide (5.Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 6.Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 7.Herold A. Truant R.

Importin α acts as an adapter in the formation of a trimeric import complex containing the NLS-bearing cargo, importin α, and the import receptor importin β. Importin β interacts with components of the nuclear pore complex known as nucleoporins (9.Görlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 10.Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As a result of these interactions the import complex is targeted to the nuclear pore complex and then translocated into the nucleus (9.Görlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A.

The mechanism for the recognition of NLS peptides by importin α has been enigmatic because of the diversity in the amino sequences of experimentally defined NLSs. The structural basis for recognition of at least one type of NLS by Saccharomyces cerevisiae importin α is now known from a crystallographic analysis of the NLS binding domain of the 50-kDa yeast importin α fragment bound to an SV40 NLS peptide (8.Conti E. Uy M. Leigthon L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). This 50-kDa importin α fragment lacks the N-terminal importin β-binding (IBB) domain and consists of 10 helical repeats known as armadillo (ARM) motifs. Each ARM motif is characterized by three α helices whose arrangement results in an array of binding sites for SV40-NLS recognition. Biochemical evidence supports the structural model and suggests that organization of the repeats determines the specificity of importin α for the NLS-containing cargo (7.Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14.Köhler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Görlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recently reported crystal structure of full-length mouse importin α in the absence of NLS substrate revealed the presence of a proposed internal NLS within the N-terminal IBB domain (15.Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This internal NLS may serve as an auto-inhibitory domain that regulates NLS binding. The structure of importin β bound to the IBB domain of importin α also indicates that the IBB domain changes conformation upon complex formation (16.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Müller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of importin α with importin β would be expected to displace the auto-inhibitory sequence of the IBB from the NLS-binding site and release the inhibition of the NLS binding to importin α. Consistent with the hypothesis that the IBB competes with the NLS for binding to importin α, a previous study demonstrated that overexpression of the IBB domain (α-(1–61)) is sufficient to inhibit nuclear import of an NLS-containing substratein vivo (17.Enenkel C. Schülke N. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1286-12991Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the crystallographic data in combination with the in vivo experiment support a model where there is a regulatory switch between the cytoplasmic form of importin α, which has high affinity for NLS substrate and the nuclear form, which has a low affinity for the NLS. Although NLS receptors from different species share structural and functional homology, the mechanism that regulates the recognition of an NLS by importin subunits and the importance of this regulation in the nuclear import process have not yet been investigated quantitatively. Since modulation of the affinity of importin α for the NLS-cargo may contribute to the regulation of NLS-dependent nuclear import, it is necessary to characterize the binding energies for each step involved in the NLS-importin α interaction. Therefore, we have used a method based on steady-state fluorescence depolarization to examine quantitatively the regulatory mechanism of NLS recognition by the NLS-binding protein, importin α. The depolarization of fluorescence emission from a solution excited by a polarized light source yields a measure of the rotational diffusion of a fluorophore. This parameter, when expressed as fluorescence anisotropy, provides a useful method for monitoring protein-protein interactions (18.Le Tilly V. Royer C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7735-7758Google Scholar). When small fluorophores are excited with polarized light, they tumble rapidly in solution relative to the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore. Thus, the light emitted from these fluorophores is significantly depolarized resulting in a low anisotropy value. If the fluorophore binds to a large macromolecule, the tumbling rate decreases. The reduction in the tumbling rate diminishes the depolarization of the emitted light yielding a relatively high anisotropy value. This relationship of size to anisotropy can provide information about the binding of a small rapidly tumbling fluorescent ligand to a large slowly rotating receptor. We have applied this method to the study of protein-protein interactions by monitoring the change in fluorescence depolarization of the green fluorescent protein tagged with a nuclear localization signal (NLS-GFP) as the NLS substrate binds to the large import receptor, importin α. We first show the utility of this method by measuring the binding equilibrium between the NLS-GFP substrate and a fragment of importin α lacking the putative auto-inhibitory IBB domain (ΔIBB importin α). The binding of GFP to the importin α fragment is absolutely dependent on the fused NLS sequence. We then demonstrate that the relative affinity between an amino acid sequence and importin α measured in vitro correlates with the ability of that sequence to act as a nuclear localization signal in vivo. Next we provide experimental support for a mechanism of unidirectional transport where the affinity of importin α for an NLS-cargo is modulated by interactions with importin β. The quantitative analysis of these interactions will provide a detailed thermodynamic model for the mechanism of protein import into the nucleus. The SV40 NLS-GFP was cloned into a pET-28a expression vector (Novagen) as an N-terminal His6 tag followed by the SV40 NLS sequence (SPKKKRKVEAS), a 10-residue linker, and finally GFP with a second C-terminal His6 tag. The SV40 NLS-GFP was overexpressed at 30 °C in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The E. coli cells were grown in LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and expression was induced, at an optical density of 0.6 (600 nm), by addition of 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% igepal). Following cell lysis with a French pressure cell and separation of cell debris by high speed centrifugation, the soluble supernatant was loaded into a Hitrap nickel chelator column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed with buffer B (50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, 0.25 m NaCl), and eluted with a 0.5 m imidazole gradient. The protein was stored at −80 °C at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% glycerol. The SV40 NLS-GFP variants SV40M (SPKTKRKVEAS), SV40A (SPKKKAKVEAS), and the IBB-GFP (importin α-(1–88)) were cloned, expressed, and purified as described above. Synthetic peptides used in this study contain the minimal essential sequence of the SV40 T-antigen NLS (SPKKKRKVEAS) and a control unrelated amino acid sequence (CINEVADELNKMLL). All assays were performed using the purified recombinant S. cerevisiae proteins Srp1p (importin α) and Kap95p (importin β). Full-length yeast importin α (residues 1–542) and a fragment yeast importin α spanning residues 88–530 (ΔIBB importin α) were expressed as His6-tagged proteins and purified fromE. coli BL21 (DE3) lysates on a nickel-chelator column as described previously (8.Conti E. Uy M. Leigthon L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Importin β was cloned into a pET based vector (pMW172) (19.Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and expressed at 30 °C in E. colistrain BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and expression was induced, at an optical density of 0.6 (600 nm), by addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Bacterial cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and chymostatin. Cells were lysed using a French pressure cell, and cell debris was separated by high speed centrifugation. Importin β was subsequently purified to homogeneity by size exclusion, hydrophobic interaction, and anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was then concentrated to 2 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, buffer containing 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out using an ISS PC1 fluorimeter fitted with polarization filters. The SV40 NLS-GFP was diluted to the desired concentration using PBS in a total volume of 1 ml in a 1-cm quartz cuvette. Changes in the anisotropy of the GFP fluorophore were monitored as aliquots of the full-length importin α, or ΔIBB importin α were successively added to the assay volume. The sample was excited with a polarized beam with a wavelength of 492 nm. The emitted light was collected using a high-pass filter with a cut-off wavelength of 510 nm. The binding assay is based on the change in the depolarization of fluorescent emissions from an NLS-GFP-containing protein upon binding to import receptors. The rapid rotational motion of the free small NLS-GFP protein in solution, relative to its fluorescence lifetime, results in the depolarization of emitted fluorescent light. The binding of importin α to NLS-GFP causes changes in the depolarization of the fluorescent light because the formation of a larger protein complex reduces the rotational motion of the GFP fluorophore. Thus, the binding of importin α to the NLS-GFP is monitored by measuring changes in the fluorescence anisotropy. The anisotropy (A) is defined as the difference between the parallel and perpendicular emitted light intensity (I∥ and I ⊥) with respect to the total intensity when parallel polarized excitation is used (see Equation 1). A=I∥−I⊥I∥+2I⊥Equation 1 The fluorescence anisotropy is related to the correlation time (τc) of the fluorophore through the Perrin Equation 2(20.Perrin F. J. Phys. Radium. 1926; 1: 390-401Crossref Google Scholar), A0A−1=ττcEquation 2 with A 0 being the limiting anisotropy of the fluorophore, a known constant, and τ the fluorescence lifetime. Therefore, the increase in the anisotropy value as a function of the concentration of a macromolecule provides a measure of the extent of its binding to the fluorophore. Either importin β or myoglobin was covalently coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml gel. Approximately 0.2 mg of purified full-length importin α and ΔIBB importin α were incubated with 0.5 ml of importin β or myoglobin-coupled gel in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mmNaCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol) for 3 h at 4 °C. The resins were then washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer, and fractions were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1m NaCl. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed on a 10% SDS gel and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. We used fluorescence depolarization to develop anin vitro assay to measure the binding affinity of the protein import receptor complex for an NLS peptide. Initial experiments were designed to determine the utility of our proposed assay in providing a quantitative measurement of the affinity between importin α and the NLS sequence. The in vitro assay was performed using the SV40 NLS sequence fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the DNA level. A fragment of importin α spanning residues 88–530 was assayed for its affinity for the NLS-GFP fusion. This fragment, denoted ΔIBB importin α, contains the NLS binding ARM domain yet lacks the N-terminal putative auto-inhibitory importin β-binding (IBB) domain. The atomic structure of ΔIBB importin α bound to an SV40 NLS peptide, determined through crystallographic analysis, allows a direct comparison of quantitative measurements of affinity with the structure of the complex (8.Conti E. Uy M. Leigthon L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We determined the binding affinity between ΔIBB importin α and the SV40 NLS-GFP by measuring changes in fluorescence depolarization of the GFP fluorophore as a function of the concentration of the ΔIBB importin α fragment (Fig. 1). The depolarization of GFP fluorescence, plotted as fluorescence anisotropy, sharply increases from a value of ∼0.31 for the NLS-GFP alone to a value of ∼0.335 upon its binding to the ΔIBB importin α fragment. The resulting data were fit to a simple equilibrium equation yielding a binding constant (K d) of 10 nm. The specificity of binding is indicated by the fact that GFP without the SV40 NLS shows no detectable binding to the importin α fragment (Fig.1). These results demonstrate that the fluorescence anisotropy-based assay allows a quantitative characterization of the interactions involved in the NLS-importin α binding. To test the specificity of the observed importin α-SV40 NLS-GFP interaction we compared the binding affinities between ΔIBB importin α and variants of the SV40 NLS. The NLS variants described in Table I were constructed as fusions to GFP. The SV40M mutant contains a threonine (Thr) instead of a lysine (Lys), which is known to abolish the nuclear import of the NLS-cargo in vivo (2.Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). In the SV40A variant an arginine (Arg) was substituted with an alanine (Ala) to generate a milder variation of the wild type sequence. The anisotropy profiles observed with the SV40M and SV40A probes clearly showed that the binding of the NLS variants to importin α was severely reduced (Fig.2). In comparison to the wild type SV40 NLS, the SV40A mutant showed a weaker interaction with the importin α fragment with a K d of 37 nm, whereas the SV40M mutant showed an even greater decrease in the binding affinity for the importin α fragment. Although the binding was not saturated due to the limited solubility of the importin α fragment, we determined the binding constant of the SV40M mutant assuming that there should be an anisotropy change similar to that observed for the wild type SV40. Based on this assumption, we calculated the binding constant of the SV40M mutant to be approximately 3 μm. These results establish a quantitative correlation between the strength of an NLS-importin α interaction and the ability of the NLS to functionin vivo.Table INLS sequencesFusion proteinNLS sequenceSV40 NLS-GFPSPKKKRKVEASSV40M NLS-GFPSPKTKRKVEASSV40A NLS-GFPSPKKKAKVEASVariations of the SV40 NLS motif fused to GFP are shown.

The NLS single-letter amino acid code includes bold letters indicating variation from the wild type SV40 NLS sequence. Crystallographic evidence suggests that the IBB domain of importin α functions as an auto-inhibitory domain, modulating the affinity of importin α for the NLS-containing cargo through intramolecular competitive inhibition (15.Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Further structural evidence intimates that the binding of importin β to importin α displaces the auto-inhibitory IBB domain from the NLS-binding site (16.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Müller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). To examine these hypotheses, we compared the binding of SV40 NLS-GFP to purified full-length importin α versus the ΔIBB importin α fragment. The binding profile showed that the full-length importin α had no measurable binding to the NLS-GFP as compared with that of the ΔIBB importin α fragment (Fig.3 A). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the IBB domain modulates NLS binding to importin α. To test further whether the IBB domain and an NLS peptide compete for binding to the ARM domain of importin α, we examined binding of an IBB-GFP fusion protein to the ΔIBB importin α fragment. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the IBB-GFP bound to the ΔIBB importin α fragment in trans. Furthermore, this binding was competed by an NLS peptide but not by an unrelated control peptide (Fig.3 B). These data are consistent with a model for direct competitive inhibition between the IBB domain and an NLS peptide. The crystal structure of an IBB domain-importin β complex suggests that the interaction of importin α with importin β may displace the auto-inhibitory sequences of the IBB from the NLS-binding site and release the inhibition of NLS binding to importin α (16.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Müller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). To ensure that the bacterially expressed full-length importin α can bind to importin β via the IBB domain, we examined the binding of purified yeast importin β to purified yeast full-length importin α or ΔIBB importin α using a solid phase binding assay. An importin β affinity gel was incubated with full-length importin α or ΔIBB importin α. The bound fractions were eluted from gel after thorough washing and were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining. As seen in Fig.4, full-length importin α binds efficiently to importin β, but deletion of the IBB domain of importin α (ΔIBB) significantly reduces the importin α-β interaction (Fig. 4, lane 2, compare with lane 4). As a control for specific binding, neither full-length nor ΔIBB importin α bound to immobilized myoglobin (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and8). As a direct test of our hypothesis that the IBB domain competes with NLS substrate for binding to the ARM domain of importin α in a manner that is regulated by importin β binding, we examined the binding of full-length importin α to the SV40 NLS-GFP when a stoichiometric amount of importin β was added to the assay. The binding profiles show that the presence of importin β increases the affinity of full-length importin α for the NLS-GFP (K d ∼33 nm) when compared with the binding of full-length importin α alone (K d >10 μm) (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the addition of a stoichiometric amount of importin β did not change the affinity of ΔIBB importin α for the NLS-GFP (Fig. 5 B). In control experiments, GFP without the SV40 NLS showed no detectable binding to the importin α-β complex and the SV40 NLS-GFP had no measurable binding to importin β alone (Fig. 5 C). These data, along with the solid phase binding assay results, suggest that importin β binds to the IBB domain and thereupon releases the inhibition of NLS binding mediated by the IBB sequence. This study presents quantitative in vitro measurements for the binding affinity of the import receptor complex to the monopartite SV40 NLS sequence. Although detailed structural and some functional analyses of the interactions between importin α, importin β, and an NLS peptide have already been reported (8.Conti E. Uy M. Leigthon L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 15.Kobe B. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), few quantitative studies of these interactions have been performed (21.Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15820-15827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of signal-dependent nuclear import requires rigorous quantitative analysis of the thermodynamic events, and this study can be seen as a step in this direction. We developed an in vitro fluorescence anisotropy assay to generate a quantitative model for the unidirectional transport of proteins into the nucleus. Fluorescence anisotropy, as a solution-based methodology, has been shown to be useful in the study of protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions (18.Le Tilly V. Royer C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7735-7758Google Scholar). Furthermore, this method is performed at equilibrium and does not require separation of free and bound species (18.Le Tilly V. Royer C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7735-7758Google Scholar, 22.Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 23.Wittmayer P.K. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For this reason we used fluorescence anisotropy to examine quantitatively the binding specificity and affinities between an NLS ligand and the receptor importin α. One important aspect of this study is that we are able to correlate an interaction energy measured in vitro (the binding of a nuclear localization signal to importin α) with the functional consequences of this interaction in vivo (transport of the NLS-cargo to the nucleus). By utilizing the NLS-binding domain of importin α (ΔIBB importin α), we measured the interaction energy between the import receptor and three variants of the SV40 nuclear localization signal fused to GFP. The binding constant for the native SV40 NLS, which can functionally act as a nuclear localization signalin vivo, was measured to be 10 nm. The SV40M variant of this NLS is not capable of functioning as a nuclear localization signal in vivo (2.Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). The binding of this variant NLS to ΔIBB importin α was observable but with a dissociation constant 300-fold weaker than that of the functional NLS sequence. Thus, as one might expect, there is a functional correlation between the affinity of importin α for an NLS and the ability of that NLS to function in vivo. In future experiments, the combination of the in vitro assay along with in vivo functional assays can thus provide a model for the relative partitioning of an NLS-containing protein between the nucleus and the cytoplasm as a function of the interaction energy with importin α. Productive nuclear import requires importin α to bind tightly to the NLS-cargo and to enter the nucleus while bound to importin β. The binding of importin β has been shown to increase the affinity of importin α for its cargo (6.Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 9.Görlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 11.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 12.Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6572-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two possible mechanisms can be considered to explain the effect of importin β on the binding between importin α and the NLS-cargo. First, importin β could stabilize the interaction between importin α and NLS-cargo through direct contacts with the cargo or with the ARM domain of importin α. Second, as proposed by Kobe (15.Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), the importin β binding domain (IBB) of importin α could bind to the NLS-binding site of importin α, thereby obstructing the binding site for the NLS-containing cargo. To determine which of the two possibilities is true, we first compared the affinity of full-length importin α for NLS to that of ΔIBB importin α which lacks the putative inhibitory domain. Although the NLS-GFP fusion bound tightly to ΔIBB importin α, there was no observable binding of the NLS substrate to full-length importin α. If the proposed auto-inhibitory mechanism regulates the interaction between importin α and the NLS, we predict that the IBB domain would bind importin α in trans. Therefore, we examined the binding of an IBB-GFP to ΔIBB importin α. We found that the IBB domain can indeed bind to ΔIBB importin α in trans. Furthermore, this binding is specifically competed by an NLS peptide. All these data support the model that the IBB domain regulates the interaction between importin α and the NLS-containing cargo. The most critical test of our hypothesis is that binding of importin β to importin α should displace the auto-inhibitory IBB domain from the NLS-binding site of importin α and increase the affinity of full-length importin α for NLS substrate. Thus, we measured the binding of the full-length importin α to SV40 NLS in the presence of importin β. We found that binding of full-length importin α-β complex to SV40 NLS was nearly as efficient as that of ΔIBB importin α. In addition, we excluded the possibility that importin β increases the affinity of full-length importin α for the NLS-GFP through direct contacts with the ARM domain by measuring the binding of ΔIBB importin α to NLS-GFP in the presence of importin β. We found that the addition of importin β did not increase the affinity of ΔIBB importin α for the NLS-GFP. Therefore, our in vitro results support the auto-inhibitory model that identifies importin β as a regulator of importin α affinity for the NLS-cargo through the interaction between importin β and the IBB domain of importin α. Recently, an ELISA-based binding assay was used to examine the interactions of both yeast and mouse importin α with various NLS peptides (21.Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15820-15827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although ELISAs can produce quantitative results, this assay is not performed under equilibrium conditions. Thus, this methodology is limited in the range of binding energies that can be accurately measured. Hu and Jans (21.Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15820-15827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) observed tight binding between full-length importin α and the SV40 NLS. In addition, this tight interaction was not affected by the presence of importin β (21.Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15820-15827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We found that the interaction between full-length importin α and the SV40 NLS was absolutely dependent on importin β. This disparity could be due to the inaccuracies inherent in measuring equilibrium binding constants through solid phase ELISA. The dependence of the importin α-NLS interaction on importin β observed in the current report is consistent with structural analyses of both an importin β-importin α complex (15.Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 16.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Müller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and an importin α·NLS peptide complex (8.Conti E. Uy M. Leigthon L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The present study uses a quantitative approach to examine interactions that are essential for the initial recognition of NLS substrate in the cytoplasm. In the future, this analysis could be extended by the addition of other components required to complete a full cycle of nuclear transport. For example, addition of Ran-GTP to the system would mimic the scenario that may occur in the nucleus where levels of Ran-GTP are elevated. A thorough examination of the changes in the importin-substrate complex that occur upon addition of Ran-GTP could yield a quantitative model for the release of the cargo into the nucleus. Conversely, export of substrates could be examined by measuring the assembly of export complexes in the presence of Ran-GTP. Thus, the experimental approach detailed in this study presents an opportunity for quantitative analysis of multiple steps that occur in the course of transporting a substrate from one side of the nuclear envelope to the other.

https://openalex.org/W2082908615,"The 20 S proteasome is an endoprotease complex that preferentially cleaves peptides C-terminal of hydrophobic, basic, and acidic residues. Recently, we showed that these specific activities, classified as chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PGPH) activity, are differently affected by Ritonavir, an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease. Ritonavir competitively inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity, whereas the trypsin-like activity was enhanced. Here we demonstrate that the Ritonavir-mediated up-regulation of the trypsin-like activity is not affected by specific active site inhibitors of the chymo-trypsin-like and PGPH activity. Moreover, we show that the mutual regulation of chymotrypsin-like and PGPH activities by their substrates as described previously by a cyclical model is not affected by selective inhibitors of the respective active sites. These data challenge the bite-chew model and suggest that effectors of proteasome activity can act by binding to non-catalytic sites. Accordingly, we propose a kinetic two-site model that assumes that the substrate (or effector) may bind to an active site as well as to a second non-catalytic modifier site. This model appears to be valid as it describes the complex kinetic effects of Ritonavir very well. Since Ritonavir partially inhibits major histocompatibility complex class I restricted antigen presentation, the postulated modifier site may be required to coordinate the active centers of the proteasome for the production of class I peptide ligands."

In mammals, there are two major classes of EH with broad and complementary substrate selectivity, soluble EH (sEH) and microsomal EH (mEH) (6Hammock B. Grant D. Storms D. Sipes I. McQueen C. Gandolfi A. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Pergamon, Oxford1997: 283-305Google Scholar). sEH participates not only in xenobiotic detoxification but also endogenous lipid metabolism, acting on epoxides of linoleic acid (leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin) (7Moghaddam M.F. Grant D.F. Cheek J.M. Greene J.F. Williamson K.C. Hammmock B.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and arachidonic acid (cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids) (8Zeldin D.C. Wei S. Falck J.R. Hammock B.D. Snapper J.R. Capdevila J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Elevated titers of linoleate and arachidonic acid diols are, respectively, thought to be associated with the inflammatory disorder known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (7Moghaddam M.F. Grant D.F. Cheek J.M. Greene J.F. Williamson K.C. Hammmock B.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (9Oltman C. Weintraub N. VanRollins M. Dellsperger K. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Inhibition of epoxide hydration may accordingly have a therapeutic value for these two serious disorders. Alternately, mEH appears to be mainly involved in the metabolism of xenobiotic epoxides (6Hammock B. Grant D. Storms D. Sipes I. McQueen C. Gandolfi A. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Pergamon, Oxford1997: 283-305Google Scholar). A protein-reactive and cytotoxic epoxide, naphthalene epoxide for example, is converted to the less toxic diol by this enzyme (10Tingle M. Pirmohamed M. Templeton E. Wilson A. Madden S. Kitteringham N. Park B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mEH is also related to activation of other arene oxides such as 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene, a member of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon class of chemical carcinogens (11Phillips D. Grover P. Drug. Metab. Rev. 1994; 26: 443-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To understand xenobiotic toxicity, metabolic aberrations associated with pathological disorders, and to develop possible therapies against these, it is important to elucidate the molecular basis of EH catalysis.The EHs belong to the α/β hydrolase fold family. These enzymes characteristically employ a two-step mechanism in which a catalytic nucleophile of the enzymes attacks a polarized electrophilic substrate, and the covalent intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed (Fig. 1) (6Hammock B. Grant D. Storms D. Sipes I. McQueen C. Gandolfi A. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Pergamon, Oxford1997: 283-305Google Scholar). The mechanism of murine sEH has been mainly elucidated from a series of experiments utilizing heavy isotopes, protein mass spectrometry, and site-directed mutagenesis (12Pinot F. Grant D.F.

They indicated that Asp333 acts as a catalytic nucleophile and that a water molecule is activated by the nearby His523 and Asp495 pair (Fig. 1). This mechanism was extended to other EHs (2Rink R.

However, one or more additional amino acids are likely involved in the catalytic cycle especially in the activation of the epoxide ring (5Beetham J.K. Grant D. Arand M. Garbarino J. Kiyosue T. Pinot F. Oesch F. Belknap W.R. Shinozaki K. Hammock B.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), based on the mechanism of the haloalkane dehalogenase, HLD1, from Xantobacter autotrophicus G10, a related α/β hydrolase (6Hammock B. Grant D. Storms D. Sipes I. McQueen C. Gandolfi A. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Pergamon, Oxford1997: 283-305Google Scholar). Kinetics of the hydrolysis of chalcone oxide by sEH support this hypothesis. Thus a generalized scheme is postulated in which one or more amino acid(s) may polarize the epoxide oxygen by an acid-like mechanism, weakening the C-O epoxide bond and facilitating the attack on the carbon of the epoxide ring by a nucleophile, such as the conjugate base, Asp333 (19Morisseau C. Du G. Newman J.W. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 214-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of murine sEH has been determined at 2.8 Å resolution (20Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B. Christianson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The structure supports the previously proposed mechanism and suggests that Tyr465 and Tyr381are the possible acid catalysts that activate the epoxide ring (Fig.1). Additionally, analysis of the crystal structure of EH from Agrobacterium radiobacter, AD1, likewise suggested that Tyr152-Tyr215 in this prokaryotic enzyme may have the same function (21Nardini M. Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Rink R. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14579-14586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, biochemical evidence is required to verify the mechanism of epoxide activation and to complement structure-based prediction.In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to explore the role of Tyr465 and Tyr381 in the catalytic mechanism of murine sEH. The sEH variants were subjected to a series of enzyme assays and kinetic studies to assess their impact on epoxide activation. Additionally, this work was extended to Tyr374of human mEH. Interpreted in view of the EH crystal structure, these results clearly support the role of active site tyrosine residues in epoxide activation by eukaryotic sEH and mEH.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we examined the role of the tyrosines in the catalytic mechanism of EH. It had been proposed that the epoxide oxygen might be activated by a possible acid catalyst to weaken the C-O bond of the epoxide ring and facilitate the attack by a nucleophilic aspartate (6Hammock B. Grant D. Storms D. Sipes I. McQueen C. Gandolfi A. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Pergamon, Oxford1997: 283-305Google Scholar). However, a variety of early studies showed that the reaction intermediate lacked full carbocation character (reviewed in Ref. 6Hammock B. Grant D. Storms D. Sipes I. McQueen C. Gandolfi A. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Pergamon, Oxford1997: 283-305Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of murine sEH (20Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B. Christianson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Dowdy D.L. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15265-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that Tyr465 and Tyr381are involved in epoxide activation by examining the mutant enzymes.The substitution of tyrosine with phenylalanine is not expected to create a significant conformational change, even locally, because the body of the tyrosine and phenylalanine are both partially buried and unchanged, whereas the changed region, the phenolic hydroxyl group, is in the solvent accessible region of the active site. We tested the hypothesis by showing that all mutant enzymes bind to the active site-directed affinity column with similar efficiency. This would not be expected if mutation caused a major alteration in the conformation of the enzyme. Our results are consistent with the prediction. The sEH variants bound on the affinity column were eluted by 1 mmFCO with lower recovery than the wild type. Because the affinity ligand is thought to interact with the putative hydrophobic tunnel close to the active site (34Wixtrom R.N. Silva M.H. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the lower recovery in sEH variants might result from weaker competition with FCO (Fig. 2 E). The largerKd found for Y465F and Y381F in compound8 (Table II) supports the possibility. Based on the results in Table II, one could expect compound 7 to give better elution; however, the decreased solubility overcame increased affinity for the enzymes. Such an effect also was observed for the wild-type enzyme (34Wixtrom R.N. Silva M.H. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Y381F/Y465F was eluted by 1 mm FCO with relatively higher yield than other mutants. In this case, the loss of two hydroxyl groups may be contributing to a weaker interaction between the enzyme and affinity ligand. No change was seen in the mobility of the wild-type and mutant enzymes on isoelectric focusing (data not shown). Taken together these data suggest that the mutations do not cause dramatic conformational changes in the active site. We hypothesize that the decreased specific activities in the mutants (Table I) result largely from a loss of the hydroxyl group(s) in the active site.The kinetics of hydrolysis of chalcone oxides suggests both Tyr465 and Tyr381 are implicated in the binding of substrate and in the formation of a hydroxyalkyl intermediate. Particularly, Tyr465 showed a linear relationship in decreased Kd and k 2 with para-substitution of chalcone oxides, indicating the amino acid directly polarizing epoxide moiety. In the complex of sEH and the potent urea inhibitor, N-cyclohexyl-N′-decyl urea, the carbonyl oxygen accepts the hydrogen bond from Tyr465 and Tyr381, and one of the NH groups accepts the hydrogen bond from Asp333. The side chain Gln382 additionally participates in a hydrogen bond interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of the urea (Fig.5 A). The binding nature suggests that the inhibitor mimics the transition state for epoxide ring opening in sEH catalysis (26Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Dowdy D.L. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15265-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with this structure-based prediction. Both mutations of the two tyrosines increased IC50 values for ureas tested (Table III). Because the epoxide substrates are susceptible to an SN2 backside attack on the carbon of epoxide ring by nucleophilic Asp333(13Borhan B. Jones A.D. Pinot F. Grant D.F. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26923-26930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the angle and distance of these two tyrosines are suitable to activate epoxide oxygen in concert with nucleophilic attack by Asp333. Analysis of small molecule crystal structures contained in the Cambridge Structural Data base (38Allen F.H. Kennard O. Chem. Design Automation News. 1993; 8: 31-37Google Scholar) yields 15 independent examples of hydrogen bonds donated from hydroxyl groups to epoxide oxygens with an average O-O separation of 2.8 Å. The scatter plot in Fig. 5 B reveals that the hydrogen bond stereochemistry between the phenolic hydroxyl groups of Tyr465, Tyr381, and the substrate epoxide oxygen modeled into the sEH active site (26Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15265-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) is quite consistent with the preferred stereochemistry of such interactions reflected by the examples from the Cambridge Structural Data base. Epoxide-phenol hydrogen bond stereochemistry is also consistent with the preferred stereochemistry of hydrogen bonds to tyrosines in refined protein structures as outlined by Ippolito et al. (39Ippolito J.A. Alexander R.S. Christianson D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of murine sEH, Tyr465 is flanked by edge to face interactions with Trp334 and Phe385(Fig. 5 C). The interaction is thought to stabilize phenolate anion in the transition state (20Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B. Christianson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our biochemical results highlight the significance of Tyr465 in the epoxide activation.Figure 5Significant residues in the active site of murine sEH. A, residues, considered as comprising “the catalytic triad” are presented in blue, tyrosines in green, tryptophans in magenta, and phenylalanines in cyan. Glu382, suspected of involvement in possible conformational changes associated with binding is shown in dark orange. The potent urea inhibitor,N-cyclohexyl-N′-decyl urea (compound14) is shown in gray with the N,N′ and O atoms of the urea moiety labeled.B, stereo view of a scatterplot of 15 hydrogen bond interactions between epoxide oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Data base (38Allen F.H.

The epoxide group of each pair is superimposed onto the reference epoxide shown while allowing the hydroxyl oxygen position to “ride” into place (light blue spheres). The hydroxyl oxygens of Tyr465 and Tyr381 in a model of the sEH-substrate complex are also superimposed (green spheres) and are well within the expected range of optimal hydrogen bond stereochemistry reflected by the examples from the data base. C, amino acid polarizing the substrate. Tyr465 is flanked by edge-to-face interactions with Phe385 and Trp334 that would stabilize the intermediate phenolate anion (20Argiriadi M. Morisseau C.

The tyrosine is absolutely conserved in all EHs sequenced (20Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B. Christianson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although it is not known if Tyr374 forms edge to face interaction with other aromatic amino acids, sequence alignment shows that Trp227and Phe290 in human mEH likely correspond to Trp334 and Phe385 in murine sEH. Additional experiments will be required to address the question if a corresponding second tyrosine exists for mEH. Tyr283 and Tyr291 in human mEH may be equivalent to Tyr381in murine sEH on the basis of distance comparison (Fig. 4 A). However, both tyrosines are not conserved in all mEHs (20Argiriadi M.

Tyr299 was suggested to be a possible second tyrosine in human mEH, based on the sequence comparison with fungus sEH. This fungus sEH belongs to the same class as mammalian mEH, although the sequence relationships were weak (37Zou J. Hallberg B.M. Bergfors T. Oesch F. Arand M. Mowbray S.L. Jones T.A. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (164) Google Scholar). There is another possibility that mEH may have only one tyrosine for activation. Genetic relationships suggest that mEH and sEH likely have diverged from common ancestor (5Beetham J.K. Grant D. Arand M. Garbarino J. Kiyosue T. Pinot F. Oesch F. Belknap W.R. Shinozaki K. Hammock B.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both enzymes are distantly related and have the same major amino acid side chain involved in hydrating epoxides. However, they are separated by a vast evolutionary distance (5Beetham J.K. Grant D. Arand M. Garbarino J. Kiyosue T. Pinot F. Oesch F. Belknap W.R. Shinozaki K. Hammock B.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and have different substrate preference; sEH has an activity on less reactive epoxides such as arachidonic acid epoxides, and mEH on reactive epoxides such as arene oxides. The sEH is more active on epoxide substrates on linear system as one would anticipate from its active site being a tunnel rather than a groove (20Argiriadi M. Morisseau C. Hammock B. Christianson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).EHs are members of the α/β hydrolase fold family-like esterases and haloalkane dehalogenases (5Beetham J.K. Grant D. Arand M. Garbarino J. Kiyosue T. Pinot F. Oesch F. Belknap W.R. Shinozaki K. Hammock B.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 40Ollis D. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B.

EHs and esterases have a common mechanism in hydrating substrates but a different nucleophile, aspartate and serine, respectively. The D333S mutant of murine sEH has no activity on epoxides (12Pinot F. Grant D.F. Beetham J.K. Parker A.G. Borhan B. Landt S. Jones A.D. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7968-7974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the mutant enzyme might acquire esterase activity with serine as a nucleophile. However, it had no hydrolytic activity on several esters. 2B. D. Hammock, unpublished data. The ester will be trigonal moving to tetrahedral as a transition state and transient intermediate interacting with NH moiety of two glycines and one alanine (41Sussman J. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C.

In contrast, the epoxide will be tetrahedral in the transition state interacting with OH moiety of two tyrosines. The absence of esterase activity in D333S can be explained in part by having an incorrect angle of the activating groups. Genetic relationships reveal that haloalkane dehalogenase and the sEH C-terminal catalytic domain are more related and might have been diverged from common ancestor (5Beetham J.K. Grant D. Arand M. Garbarino J. Kiyosue T. Pinot F. Oesch F. Belknap W.R. Shinozaki K. Hammock B.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both enzymes have a common nucleophilic aspartate (6Hammock B. Grant D. Storms D. Sipes I. McQueen C. Gandolfi A. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Pergamon, Oxford1997: 283-305Google Scholar). In haloalkane dehalogenase HLD1, however, two tryptophans (Trp125 and Trp175) are responsible for the activation of the halide-leaving group (43Verschueren K. Seljee F. Rozeboom H. Kalk K. Dijkstra B. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, Trp334 and Trp524conserved in the EH family are located near the active site in murine sEH. In the past, these two residues were proposed to activate the epoxide ring (14Arand M. Wagner H. Oesch F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4223-4229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Laughlin L.T. Tzeng H.F. Lin S. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2897-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the orientation, angle, and distance are not suitable to activate the substrate epoxide, supporting the previous mutagenesis results of these tryptophans (14Arand M. Wagner H. Oesch F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4223-4229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Laughlin L.T. Tzeng H.F. Lin S. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2897-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, an epoxide likely needs more activation than a halide group does. These data suggest the possibility that EHs have acquired a unique mechanism for substrate activation through evolution. Alternately, lysine was previously postulated to be a proton-donating group (2Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Beetham J.K. Grant D. Arand M. Garbarino J. Kiyosue T. Pinot F. Oesch F. Belknap W.R. Shinozaki K.

This residue is, however, not present in the active site (Fig. 5 A).In conclusion, we demonstrated the involvement of tyrosine in the activation of epoxide in the catalytic cycle of EH. The activation mechanism is apparently conserved within EH family and is likely unique in the α/β hydrolase fold family. Epoxide hydrolases (EH,1EC3.3.2.3) hydrolyze epoxides and arene oxides to their corresponding diols (1Oesch F. Xenobiotica. 1973; 3: 305-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). These enzymes are widely distributed among many species, including bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, and mammals (2Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D. J. Biol.

In mammals, there are two major classes of EH with broad and complementary substrate selectivity, soluble EH (sEH) and microsomal EH (mEH) (6Hammock B. Grant D. Storms D. Sipes I. McQueen C. Gandolfi A. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Pergamon, Oxford1997: 283-305Google Scholar). sEH participates not only in xenobiotic detoxification but also endogenous lipid metabolism, acting on epoxides of linoleic acid (leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin) (7Moghaddam M.F. Grant D.F. Cheek J.M. Greene J.F. Williamson K.C. Hammmock B.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and arachidonic acid (cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids) (8Zeldin D.C. Wei S. Falck J.R. Hammock B.D. Snapper J.R. Capdevila J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Elevated titers of linoleate and arachidonic acid diols are, respectively, thought to be associated with the inflammatory disorder known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (7Moghaddam M.F. Grant D.F. Cheek J.M. Greene J.F. Williamson K.C. Hammmock B.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (9Oltman C. Weintraub N. VanRollins M. Dellsperger K. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Inhibition of epoxide hydration may accordingly have a therapeutic value for these two serious disorders. Alternately, mEH appears to be mainly involved in the metabolism of xenobiotic epoxides (6Hammock B. Grant D. Storms D. Sipes I. McQueen C. Gandolfi A. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Pergamon, Oxford1997: 283-305Google Scholar). A protein-reactive and cytotoxic epoxide, naphthalene epoxide for example, is converted to the less toxic diol by this enzyme (10Tingle M. Pirmohamed M. Templeton E. Wilson A. Madden S. Kitteringham N. Park B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mEH is also related to activation of other arene oxides such as 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene, a member of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon class of chemical carcinogens (11Phillips D. Grover P.

Nine distinct mammalian 5-phosphatases have been identified and characterized, while four 5-phosphatases have been described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All 5-phosphatases are defined by the presence of a conserved 300-amino acid domain, which contains two signature motifs, proposed to mediate substrate binding and catalysis (1Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Mitchell C.A. Brown S. Campbell J.K. Munday A.D. Speed C.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although all 5-phosphatase enzymes contain these signature motifs, there is considerable diversity in the substrate specificity of 5-phosphatase isoforms. The enzyme family has been subclassified on this basis into four types, I–IV. The type I enzymes, characterized by the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase (also called 5-phosphatase I), hydrolyze Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 but not any of the 5-position phosphoinositide substrates; the type II 5-phosphatases, including synaptojanin, 5-phosphatase II (originally designated the 75-kDa 5-phosphatase), and the protein product of the oculocerebrorenal syndrome (OCRL) gene, hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and Ins(1,4,5)P3; type III enzymes, characterized by SHIP and SHIP-2, only hydrolyze PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and finally the type IV enzymes, which have been partially purified, but not cloned, are specific for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 only (1Majerus P.W.

Trans. 1996; 24: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The functional roles mediated by 5-phosphatase enzymes have been demonstrated by a number of recent studies in which gene-targeted deletion of specific 5-phosphatases has been achieved. Mice deficient in the type II 5-phosphatase synaptojanin exhibit neurological defects and die shortly after birth, providing evidence for a critical role for 5-phosphatase-mediated phosphoinositide regulation in synaptic vesicle recycling (3Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P.

Targeted disruption of the type III 5-phosphatase SHIP, which has a restricted expression to hematopoietic cells, results in dramatic hyperplasia of myeloid cells in the bone marrow, spleen, and lungs, resembling a myeloproliferative syndrome (4Helgason C.D.

Although mice deficient in the OCRL protein demonstrate no phenotype (5Janne P.A. Suchy S.F. Bernard D. MacDonald M. Crawley J. Grinberg A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Westphal H. Nussbaum R.L. J. Clin.

Disruption in 5-phosphatase II results in testicular abnormalities. Mice deficient in both the OCRL protein and 5-phosphatase II die in utero (5Janne P.A. Suchy S.F. Bernard D. MacDonald M.

Collectively these studies suggest the 5-phosphatases have distinct functions that are nonredundant. This specificity may be mediated by the tissue and subcellular location of each 5-phosphatase or by specific interactions with a variety of other signaling proteins and pathways. Type II and III 5-phosphatases form complexes with other proteins via N-terminal SH2 domains and/or C-terminal proline-rich domains. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a 72-kDa 5-phosphatase with a restricted tissue expression. The novel 5-phosphatase hydrolyzes PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,5)P2 and localizes to the cytosolic face of the Golgi by the N-terminal proline-rich domain but not the C-terminal CAAX motif. We propose that the location of the 72-kDa 5-phosphatase to the Golgi may play a role in regulating vesicular trafficking through this compartment.

A mouse brain λZAP II cDNA library (1 × 106recombinants) was screened using a cDNA (nucleotides 5–636) derived from the human EST clone U45974. The cDNA was labeled with [α32P]dCTP and hybridized at 40 °C using standard techniques and conditions (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNAs from eight positive clones were identified, plaque-purified, and subcloned into the vector Bluescript II KS−. Of these, three clones of varying length (2.4, 3.3, and 3.9 kb) were completely sequenced on both strands using standard dideoxynucleotide sequencing procedures and an “oligo-walk” strategy (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All three clones showed identical sequences in overlapping areas to the largest clone of 3.9 kb, which was designated M4. Sequence analysis was performed using DNASIS version 7.0 (Hitachi) software and ANGIS and BLAST-EST programs. The cDNA sequence is available at GenBankTMAF226683. A membrane containing poly(A) RNA isolated from various adult mouse tissues and cell lines was probed with the 2.0-kb cDNA encoding the open reading frame of the M4 clone. The open reading frame was obtained by PCR amplification and subcloning into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). Isolated DNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (Prime-a-gene, Promega) and hybridized to the membranes overnight at 42 °C. Blots were washed using standard procedures (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

O'Bryan M.K. McFarlane J.R. Loveland K.L. Mallidis C. Foulds L.M. Phillips D.J. de Kretser D.M. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 112: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Slides were then exposed to an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), riboprobes were detected with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/bromochloroindolyl phosphate substrate, and the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. The 3.9-kb full-length cDNA (M4) and a shorter clone commencing at nucleotide 603, immediately 5′ to the proposed initiator methionine, were subcloned into the HindIII site of eukaryotic expression vector pSVTf (11Madison E.L. Bird P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using the TNT Coupled Wheatgerm Extract Systems (Promega), these cDNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. Translation products were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by fluorography. Anti-peptide antibodies were generated to a synthetic peptide conjugated to diptheria toxoid. This peptide represented amino acids 622–635 (KRRISKEIQRQEAL) in the C-terminal sequence, unique to the 72-kDa 5-phosphatase. Conjugated peptide was injected intramuscularly into two New Zealand White rabbits. Affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies were obtained by chromatography of preimmune or immune sera on specific peptide coupled to thiopropyl-Sepharose resin. Following extensive washing, specific antibodies were eluted from the column with 0.1m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. Various adult mouse tissue samples were obtained immediately postmortem and suspended in lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine). Tissues were homogenized on ice immediately for 3 × 20 s (LABSONIC 1510) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this centrifugation represents the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction, and the pellet resuspended in the same volume of lysis buffer represents the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Approximately 100 μg of protein from each fraction was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) Immunoblot analysis utilized affinity-purified anti-peptide antibody. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Silenus, Melbourne, Australia) diluted to 1:10,000. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). For indirect immunofluorescence, Tera-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed and permeabilized for 10 min in PBS with 3.7% formaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100. Preimmune or affinity-purified anti-peptide sera specific for the 72-kDa 5-phosphatase were incubated with the cells for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and then placed in 1:400 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Silenus). Co-localization with specific anti-Golgi markers was performed by incubating with anti-β-COP monoclonal antibody (1:80) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with the secondary tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma). The cells were visualized using both fluorescence and confocal microscopy. The complete open reading frame of the M4 clone encoding the 72-kDa 5-phosphatase was amplified by PCR and subcloned in frame into the HindIII site of pEGFP-C2 (pEGFP-M4) and into the XbaI site of pCGN (pCGN-M4), thereby adding N-terminal GFP and HA tags in frame, respectively, to the 72-kDa 5-phosphatase. Mutants in which the CAAX motif was either deleted or mutated were generated as follows. A cDNA fragment in which the nucleotides coding for the C-terminal CAAX motif were deleted from the open reading frame was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the HindIII site of pEGFP-C2 (pEGFP-ΔCAAX), and the XbaI site of pCGN (pCGN-ΔCAAX). A PCR strategy was also used to perform site-directed mutagenesis in which the cysteine residue (Cys644) of the 72-kDa 5-phosphatase within the CAAX motif was replaced with alanine. The resulting cDNA was subcloned into the HindIII site of pEGFP-C2 (pEGFP-C644A). To generate a recombinant GFP-tagged N-terminal proline-rich domain, a truncated construct lacking both the 5-phosphatase domain and C-terminal CAAX motif was derived by EcoRI digestion of pEGFP-M4 followed by religation. The resulting fusion plasmid (pEGFP-PRD) encodes amino acids 1–339 of the 72-kDa 5-phosphatase. The nucleotide sequence of all PCR-derived constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The cDNAs encoding the open reading frames of the 72-kDa 5-phosphatase, CAAX-deleted or -mutated constructs, generated as described above, were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized as outlined for Tera-1 cells. Expression of HA-tagged proteins was localized using anti-HA monoclonal antibody and detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Co-localization was performed using specific Golgi markers, β-COP or p230, and detected using secondary tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody or rhodamine-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody, respectively. Transfected cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. To confirm the synthesis of recombinant GFP- or HA-tagged proteins, transfected cells were washed briefly with wash buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol) before being scraped from the plate and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. An aliquot was removed at this time and represents the total cell lysate sample. The remaining cells were briefly sonicated and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol) was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of wash buffer plus 1% Triton X-100, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the Triton-soluble fraction. The resulting pellet (Triton-insoluble fraction) was resuspended in 500 μl of the Triton-wash buffer. Brefeldin A studies were performed as follows. Tera-1 or COS-7 cells 48 h after transfection were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum containing 1 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 37 °C. BFA was removed, and the cells were immediately fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with anti-Golgi antibodies as described above. After exposure to BFA, cells were washed with PBS before fresh culture medium was added, and the cells were allowed to recover overnight (16 h). The cDNA coding for the open reading frame of M4 was subcloned in frame into the XbaI site of pCGN vector. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the recombinant plasmid or the empty vector using LipofectAMINE reagent. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After brief sonication, cells were gently agitated for 2 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The HA-tagged recombinant 5-phosphatase was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using 60 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco), and rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody (DAKO). Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates captured on protein A-Sepharose were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2). All immunoprecipitations were assessed in duplicate for enzyme activity or by immunoblot analysis to detect the immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged 72-kDa 5-phosphatase. 32P-labeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 was isolated from erythrocyte ghosts as described previously (12Downes C.P. Mussat M.C. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of32P-labeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 was measured by extraction of released 32PO4 using a substrate concentration of 30 μm and three linear protein concentrations in triplicate (13Connolly T.M. Bross T.E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7868-7874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P25-phosphatase assays were performed using 100 μm[3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 (3500 cpm/nmol) as described previously (14Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some assays, detergent was excluded from the reaction. Assays were performed for 10 min at 37 °C using three linear protein concentrations in triplicate. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4assays were performed in duplicate as described previously (15Mitchell C.A. Connolly T.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8873-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of 32P-labeled PtdIns(3,4,5)P3substrate was undertaken as follows: 25 μg of phosphatidylserine and 65 μg of PtdIns(4,5)P2 were mixed and dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 400 μl of lipid resuspension buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) and sonicated for 5 min. 50 μl of this suspension was added to 5 nmol of unlabeled ATP and 20 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (2 mCi, 3000 mCi/mmol), 5 μl of 20× kinase buffer (400 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mmMgCl2, 20 mm EGTA) and 1 μg of affinity-purified recombinant PI 3-kinase in a reaction volume of 100 μl (16Layton M.J. Harpur A.G. Panayotou G. Bastiaens P.I.H. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33379-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following incubation overnight at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m HCl, and following the addition of 5 μg of phosphatidylserine, the lipid was extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 2 m KCl saturated with chloroform. Extracted lipids were dried and used for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase assays, performed on immunoprecipitates as described previously (17Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Matzaris M. Brown S. Mitchell C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4490-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Following the reaction, lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC chromatography. The lipid products of the reaction were excised separately from the TLC and deacylated and analyzed by HPLC chromatography on a Zorbax SAX (250 × 4.6-mm) column, 5 μm beads, as described (18Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Cantley L.C. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, New York1990: 163-164Google Scholar). The labeled substrate was prepared essentially as described for labeled PtdIns(3,4,5)P3; however, 40 μg of PtdIns 5-P was used as the substrate in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase assays. PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase assays were performed as for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase assays and analyzed by TLC. In some assays, instead of analysis by TLC, the reaction products were deacylated immediately following the reaction and analyzed by HPLC chromatography as described (19Dove S.K. Michell R.H. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 255-281Google Scholar). The migration of deacylated lipid products from PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase assays was compared with the migration of deacylated [3H]inositol-labeled yeast lipids, which were extracted following hyperosmotic stress with 1.1 m NaCl for 10 min as described (19Dove S.K. Michell R.H. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 255-281Google Scholar). cDNAs coding for the 72-kDa 5-phosphatase with or without the CAAX motif were excised from pEGFP-M4 and pEGFP-ΔCAAX by HindIII digestion and subcloned into pSVTf. In vitro transcription/translation was performed in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine pancreatic microsomes according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). 0.8 μg of template DNA (prepared using QiaSpin columns from Qiagen) was used for each reaction. The microsomes were subjected to three washes with PBS, followed by proteinase K treatment, as outlined by Bascomet al. (20Bascom R.A. Srinivasan S. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2953-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A reaction containing 0.25 μg of control RNA coding for β-lactamase was also performed to demonstrate that microsomes remained intact throughout the various procedures. The translated products were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, which were dried at room temperature and exposed to Kodak BioMax film for 48 h at −70 °C. A 1.6-kb human cDNA EST cloneU45974 encoding the predicted partial coding sequence of a novel human 5-phosphatase was used to screen a mouse brain λZAP II cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of eight positive clones. The largest clone (M4) contained a 3.9-kb insert as determined by restriction digestion and Southern blot analysis. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the 3.9-kb mouse brain cDNA (M4) predicts for a 1944-bp open reading frame encoding a 72-kDa polypeptide, with the initiator methionine occurring at nucleotide 595 and the termination codon at 2538 (Fig. 1 a). The 5′-untranslated region contains a number of in frame stop codons prior to the proposed initiator methionine. In addition, the region prior to the initiator methionine bears no similarity to other cDNA sequences in various data bases. M4 contains a 3′-untranslated region with a poly(A) tail commencing at nucleotide 3869. The amino acid sequence predicts for an N-terminal proline-rich domain with 13% prolines over 221 amino acids containing five PXXP motifs, which may form complexes with SH3 domain-containing proteins. The C terminus predicts for a CAAX motif (CTVS), which in other proteins, is a signal for post-translational modification by farnesylation and thereby membrane attachment. Hydrophobicity analysis reveals that the M4 protein product contains no significant hydrophobic domains and does not predict for a transmembrane domain (not shown). M4 demonstrates significant sequence identity with the human EST cloneU45974, which was used to screen the library. The amino acid sequence bears 84% identity over 175 amino acids, and the two 5-phosphatase signature motifs are identical. The C terminus of the protein predicted by human EST U45974 is 50 amino acids longer than that encoded by the mouse 3.9-kb cDNA (M4) and unlike the mouse clone does not predict for a C-terminal CAAX motif. However, we have resequenced clone U45974and identified a sequence error that results in a frameshift. When corrected, the translated protein predicted by the EST ends 147 nucleotides shorter and predicts for a C-terminal CAAX motif. We therefore propose that the 3.9-kb cDNA M4 represents the mouse homologue of the partial human EST U45974. The protein encoded by M4 cDNA demonstrates significant sequence identity with other 5-phosphatases. Analysis of data bases indicates that the 3.9-kb cDNA bears significant cDNA and amino acid sequence identity with a partial rat cDNA recently reported to represent a novel 5-phosphatase designated pharbin (for “phosphatase that induces arborization”) (21Asano T. Mochizuki Y. Matsumoto K. Takenawa T. Endo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pharbin represents a rat cDNA comprising 2.7 kb but lacks the 5′-prime end of the cDNA and initiator methionine found in the mouse 3.9-kb cDNA M4 reported here (Fig. 1 a). The pharbin sequence bears 94% nucleotide sequence identity over 2044 base pairs and 88% amino acid identity over 647 amino acids with the M4 protein. We propose that pharbin r"

Prior studies from our laboratory indicated that activation of adenylate cyclase was associated with depletion of O-GlcNAc modification. This finding and evidence that human GFAT (hGFAT) might be regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) led us to investigate the role of PKA in hGFAT function. We confirmed that adenylate cyclase activation by forskolin results in diminishedO-GlcNAc modification of several cellular proteins which can be overcome by exposure of the cells to glucosamine but not glucose, suggesting the PKA activation results in depletion of UDP-GlcNAc for O-glycosylation. To determine if GFAT is indeed regulated by PKA, we expressed the active form of the enzyme using a vaccinia virus expression system and showed that the activity of the enzyme was to decrease to undetectable levels by PKA phosphorylation. We mapped the PKA phosphorylation sites with the aid of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy and showed that the protein was stoichiometrically phosphorylated at serine 205 and also phosphorylated, to a lesser extent at serine 235. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the phosphorylation of serine 205 by PKA was necessary for the observed inhibition of enzyme activity while serine 235 phosphorylation played no observable role. The activity of GFAT is down-regulated by cAMP, thus placing regulation on the hexosamine pathway that is in concert with the energy requirements of the organism. During starvation, hormones acting through adenylate cyclase could direct the flux of glucose metabolism into energy production rather than into synthetic pathways that require hexosamines.

In vertebrates, the extracellular glucose concentration is tightly maintained despite changes in the availability of dietary carbohydrates. This homeostasis is accomplished by appropriate hormone signaling that directs glucose into energy yielding pathways during starvation versus synthetic and storage pathways in the fed state. Insulin is the major hormone that coordinates the utilization of glucose for synthetic and storage functions in the fed state while a variety of other hormones are secreted in response to stress and starvation to coordinate the utilization of glucose for energy production. A key intermediary metabolite of glucose is fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P).1Fru-6-P metabolism is tightly regulated allosterically and by hormones to be in concert with the nutritional status of the intact organism. Fru-6-P can be metabolized through glycolysis to create ATP and/or it can be metabolized to glucosamine for use in glycoprotein synthesis by the enzyme GFAT (1.Kornfeld S. Ginsburg V. Exp. Cell. Res. 1966; 41: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in liver and kidney, Fru-6-P can be utilized for gluconeogenesis. Thus, this substrate plays a pivotal role in the flux of glucose into energy yielding pathways or into synthetic and storage pathways. In hormone responsive tissues, starvation or stress is signaled by glucagon and epinephrine, and in both cases, these hormones are coupled to the accumulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). The impact of cAMP accumulation in the liver on Fru-6-P metabolism is to direct the flux of Fru-6-P into gluconeogenesis (2.Pilkis S.J. Claus T.H. Kurland I.J. Lange A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 799-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) while in the heart, cAMP accumulation through epinephrine stimulation results in the flux of Fru-6-P into glycolysis (3.Depre C. Rider M.H. Hue L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the net effect of starvation or stress is for the liver to release glucose to provide for the energy requirements of muscle and heart. From this consideration, it would be reasonable to predict that part of this concerted control on Fru-6-P utilization during starvation or stress would be the cessation of Fru-6-P flux into glucosamine synthesis and hence into glycoprotein synthesis. Previously, we reported that glucose starvation combined adenylate cyclase activation by forskolin treatment of NRK fibroblasts resulted in the depletion of the transcription factor Sp1 by a process that involves proteasomes (4.Han I.

However, under these conditions of adenylate cyclase activation and glucose starvation, Sp1 and several other proteins were observed to undergo nearly complete removal of the O-GlcNAc modification (4.Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Conversely, exposure of cells to glucose or glucosamine resulted in an increase in the modification of proteins by O-GlcNAc (4.Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar,13.Roos M.D. Han I-O. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C803-C811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We postulated that the O-GlcNAc state of Sp1 or other proteins controlled the degradation of this transcription factor by the proteasome (4.Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 5.Su K. Roos M.D. Yang X. Han I. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15194-15202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since Sp1 is critically important for the transcription of TATA-less housekeeping genes (14.Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), this loss of Sp1 would result in the down-regulation of those genes that encode the bulk of cellular proteins under conditions of nutrient deprivation or stress (cAMP). A role for the O-GlcNAc modification in the control of protein synthesis at the translational level has also been suggested by the studies of elongation factor 2 (15.Chakraborty A. Saha A. Bose M. Chatterjee Gupta N.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16.Datta B. Chakrabarti D. Roy A.L. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Together, these studies suggest that the O-GlcNAc state of certain intracellular proteins may coordinate the level of macromolecular synthesis in the cell in a manner that reflects the nutritional status. The studies described in this article resulted from our attempt to understand how the O-GlcNAc status of Sp1 and other proteins could be modified by exposure of cells to the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin. Either this treatment resulted in a decreased rate of modification or an increased rate of O-GlcNAc removal from these proteins. Since we had shown thatO-GlcNAc modification is a substrate driven in certain cell types (13.Roos M.D. Han I-O. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Am. J.

Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of GFAT indicated the presence of two potential cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation sites (20.Zhou J. Huynh Q.K. Hoffman R.T. Crook E.D. Daniels M.C. Gulve E.A. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While recently evidence has suggested that PKA phosphorylation of liver-derived rat GFAT activates this enzyme (20.Zhou J. Huynh Q.K. Hoffman R.T. Crook E.D. Daniels M.C. Gulve E.A. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we showed that PKA phosphorylation of recombinant hGFAT shut down enzymatic activity, thereby reducing the availability of substrate for O-GlcNAc modification. This notion would fit with the idea that stress and starvation should cause the flux of glucose carbons into energy yielding pathways rather than synthetic pathways. Our results are compatible with GFAT playing a regulatory role in glycoprotein synthesis that is in concert with the metabolic signals that regulate Fru-6-P utilization. Protein kinase A catalytic subunit, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd), l-glutamine, glutamic acid, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, mycophenolic acid, thrombin, and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Sigma.

Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RP-HPLC column was purchased from VYDAC. BSC40 cells and NRK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), 100 μg of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of gentamicin/ml at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 7.5% CO2. Cultured NRK cells at 70% confluency in 10-cm culture dishes were incubated in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. The next morning, the cells were pretreated with/without forskolin (100 μm) for 1 h followed by different concentrations of glucose or glucosamine treatment for additional 5 h. The cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped down, and lysed by freeze-thaw cycles in cold high-salt lysis buffer containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol. The protein supernatant was collected after centrifugation and the protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric protein assay (Bio-Rad Dc). The extracts containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The O-GlcNAc signal was detected by a monoclonal RL2 antibody (4.Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 13.Roos M.D. Han I-O.

Parental human GFAT (hGFAT) cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. G. McKnight in the Bluescript plasmid (22.McKnight G.L. Mudri S.L. Mathewes S.L. Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J.

For cloning into the pTM3 expression construct, the 5,152-base pair region of hGFAT cDNA was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers with the following sequences: 5′-CATGAATTCTGTGGTATATTTGCTTAC-3′ and 5′-CATGGATCCGGCTTCCCAATCTTTATC-3′. The PCR product was ligated into a the pT7T3 plasmid between EcoRI and BamHI. The cloned PCR product was sequenced to confirm fidelity of the PCR amplication and then it was digested with BsmBI, which is unique and intrinsic to the GFAT sequence, and EcoRI. This fragment was ligated into the 5′ region of GFAT, thereby placing theEcoRI site immediately 5′ to the coding sequence. The 5′ 900 base pairs of the hGFAT cDNA between the EcoRI site and an intrinsic PstI site was cloned into the pTM3-GST plasmid (5.Su K. Roos M.D. Yang X. Han I. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol.

The remainder of the GFAT coding sequence was excised from the GFAT cDNA with PstI and SalI and ligated downstream of the 900-base pair fragment of GFAT that had already been cloned into GST-pTM3. This yielded a construct that encodes the full-length GFAT as a fusion protein with GST. The procedures for generation of recombinant GST-hGFAT vaccinia virus were as described (4.Han I. Kudlow J.E.

Moss. hGFAT was expressed as a fusion protein with GST in BSC40 cells using the viral expression system. 24 h after infection, the cells were lysed in high-salt lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol by three cycles of freeze-thaw. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and purified by incubation with a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads (100 μl) were washed with cold enzyme assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The fusion protein was eluted from the bead with 10 mm reduced glutathione and the concentration of the protein was determined by both standard protein assay (Bio-Rad Dc) and SDS-PAGE. The enzyme activity was determined by a spectrophotometric method as described (22.McKnight G.L. Mudri S.L. Mathewes S.L. Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Biol.

Essentially, in a standard 1-ml assay, the purified GST-GFAT fusion protein (1 μg) bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 10 mm glutamine, 10 mm fructose 6-phosphate, 0.5 mm 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, and 20 units of glutamate dehydrogenase in enzyme assay buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was collected after incubation and absorbance at 365 nm was determined. A blank calibration control consisted of the entire reaction mixture with GST alone bound to the beads. The purified GST-hGFAT fusion protein (1 μg) was phosphorylated in vitro while bound on glutathione-Sepharose beads by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent PKA in phosphorylation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi), 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 20 min. After the phosphorylation reaction, the beads were washed with enzyme assay buffer. An aliquot of beads was removed and the bound protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue and the level of phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. The remainder of the beads was assayed for GFAT enzymatic activity as described above. An unphosphorylated GST-hGFAT control was treated identically in the phosphorylation buffer without PKA but in the presence of ATP. The two potential PKA phosphorylation sites (Ser205, Ser235) were mutated to alanine by PCR, one site at a time or in combination of the two sites. The enzyme activity and phosphorylation assays were performed as described above. DH5α cell (5 μg) DNA was used as a template for PCR amplicification of theE. coli GFAT. Two oligonucleotide primers, designed based on the sequence of the E. coli GFAT gene (Genebank accession numbers: AE000450 and U00096) (5′-CATTCTAGAATGTGTGGAATTGTTGGC and 5′-CATAGGCCTTTACTCAACCGTAACCGATTTTGC) were used to amplify theE. coli GFAT gene (1.8 kilobase). The PCR product was purified and cloned into Bluescript between XbaI andStuI and the insert sequence was confirmed by restriction digestion and automated sequencing. For expression of the E. coli enzyme, the gene was cloned into the GST-pTM3 construct between SpeI and SalI and expressed as a GST fusion protein following generation of recombinant E. coliGFAT vaccinia virus. The assay of E. coli GFAT enzymatic activity was performed exactly as described for the hGFAT. Purified wild type GST-hGFAT fusion protein (20 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP (ATP concentration of 0.1 μm, specific activity: 3000 Ci/mmol) and 100 units of PKA catalytic subunit at 30 °C for 15 min. An equal aliquot of PKA and 10 mmcold ATP was added to the labeling reaction and incubation was continued for another 15 min to ensure stoichiometric phosphorylation. The beads were washed two times with washing buffer containing 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl, one time with buffer containing only 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). The bound and labeled GST-hGFAT fusion protein was eluted from the glutathione beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione in the 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) buffer at room temperature for 20 min. The protein solution was concentrated by a size exclusion filter (Microcon), after which the GST-hGFAT fusion protein was digested with sequencing grade trypsin in the 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) buffer at an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:10 at room temperature overnight. The GST-hGFAT tryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC on a Microsorb-MV C18 column (Rainin, Woburn, MA). Elution of the column was with a linear increasing concentration (5–75%) of acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The radioactivity in an equal aliquot from each collected fraction was determined using a scintillation counter. The HPLC fractions containing the32P-labeled peptides were vacuum dried, solubilized in 5% trifluoroacetic acid in water and the mass of the peptides in the fraction was determined by MALDI-TOF as described previously (5.Su K.

Physicians. 1998; 110: 422-432PubMed Google Scholar). The instrument was calibrated with Neurotensin and Substance P. An unphosphorylated GST-GFAT tryptic digest and trypsin blank were also run as controls. Previously, we showed that glucose starvation and forskolin stimulation of NRK cells results in reduced modification of Sp1 and other intracellular proteins byO-GlcNAc (4.Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To determine whether this response results from depletion of substrate for the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase, the cells were starved of glucose, then pretreated with or without forskolin prior to exposure to glucose or glucosamine (Fig.1). The level of protein modification byO-GlcNAc was then determined on extracts from these cells using Western blotting with the monoclonal antibody, RL2. In prior studies, we have shown that the binding of RL2 to proteins on Western blots can be blocked by preadsorption of the antibody with GlcNAc but not with GlcN or other acetylated hexosamines (13.Roos M.D. Han I-O. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C803-C811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Liu K. Paterson A.J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Under glucose starvation conditions, multiple protein bands were detected with RL2 and these bands became more intense when the cells were treated with 5 or 25 mm glucose. The bands became still more intense if the cells were treated with 5 mmglucosamine. However, when the cells were pretreated with forskolin for 1 h prior to the exposure to the sugars, the RL2 signal in the glucose-starved cells and in the glucose-treated cells became undetectable while glucosamine treatment of the cells was able to restore the RL2 signal. The Western blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-STAT3 antibody to control for protein loading. Only small fluctuations in the STAT3 signal were evident. This result agrees with our earlier observations (4.Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and is compatible with the notion that forskolin treatment of the cells blocks the activity of GFAT, thereby depriving O-GlcNAc transferase of substrate for protein modification and a reduction of modification on the O-GlcNAc proteins. This substrate restriction can be overcome in forskolin-treated cells by the provision of glucosamine in the extracellular medium. To directly test the effect of PKA phosphorylation on hGFAT, we expressed and purified recombinant hGFAT and exposed the enzyme to the catalytic subunit of PKA. To express hGFAT, we developed a recombinant vaccinia virus that encodes hGFAT as a fusion protein with GST. The GST-hGFAT was expressed in BSC40 cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus and the fusion protein was purified to near homogeneity on a glutathione affinity column (see below). To determine if it was necessary to cleave hGFAT from the GST tag, we compared the activity of GST-hGFAT bound to the glutathione affinity beads with the activity of hGFAT cleaved from the GST with thrombin. The GFAT activity of the fusion protein bound to the beads was the same as the activity of the enzyme cleaved from the GST (and the beads) with thrombin (data not shown). Therefore, the phosphorylation studies on GFAT could be performed directly on the purified and bound GST-hGFAT. This approach gave certain advantages. Because the phosphorylation step was performed on the GST-hGFAT bound to the affinity column, the subsequent removal of the catalytic subunit of PKA and a buffer exchange for the optimal measurement of GFAT activity was simplified. Treatment of 10 pmol (1 μg) of GST-hGFAT fusion protein with various doses of PKA in this manner resulted in a dose-dependent loss of GFAT activity from the fusion protein (Fig.2 A) and a corresponding dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of GST-GFAT (Fig. 2 B). The half-maximal effect of PKA on GFAT activity occurred at a dose of approximately 50 units (1 unit of PKA transfers 1 pmol of phosphate/min) and at 150 units, no residual GFAT activity could be measured. Correspondingly, incorporation of [32P]phosphate into GFAT was dose-dependent with half-maximal phosphorylation occurring at a dose of approximately 50 units of PKA (Fig. 2 B). A similar inhibition of GFAT activity was observed when the enzyme activity was measured following cleavage of the GFAT by thrombin to remove GST (data not shown). The phosphorylation and activity studies were performed on equal quantities of GST-GFAT protein (Fig. 2 C). Since the GFAT activity assay was performed after the removal of ATP and PKA by washing the glutathione affinity beads, the possibilities of an allosteric effect of ATP or a phosphorylation effect on the read out enzyme for the GFAT activity assay, glutamate dehydrogenase, was made much less likely. To further control for potential interference of the PKA phosphorylation reagents with the GFAT enzyme assay, we performed similar studies on recombinant GFAT cloned from E. coli. TheE. coli GFAT shows roughly 35% sequence homology with the mammalian homolog and is not feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc (25.Roos M.D. Xie W. Su K. Clark J.A. Yang X. Chin E. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 422-432PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli GFAT also contains a potential PKA phosphorylation motif (serine 342), but this serine residue is in a region of theE. coli GFAT that is not conserved in mammalian GFAT. TheE. coli GFAT cDNA was expressed as a fusion protein with GST using the same viral expression system. Functional studies showed that this cloned E. coli GFAT fusion protein was enzymatically active. Exposure of 10 pmol of E. coli GFAT to the same dose range of PKA resulted in no significant effect on the activity of the bacterial enzyme (Fig. 2 A). This result suggested that the sensitivity of hGFAT to PKA treatment results from specific structural determinants in the human enzyme and not from an effect of PKA on the GFAT enzyme assay system. Examination of the sequence of hGFAT reveals two potential PKA phosphorylation sites (20.Zhou J. Huynh Q.K. Hoffman R.T. Crook E.D. Daniels M.C. Gulve E.A. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) at serine 205 and serine 235. To determine the actual sites of phosphorylation, we conducted a phosphopeptide mapping study of hGFAT. To this end, purified GST-GFAT fusion protein was labeled sequentially with [γ-32P]ATP then with cold ATP catalyzed in each case by 100 units of PKA to ensure stoichiometic phosphorylation of the protein. The protein was then cleaved with sequence grade trypsin and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC. Fig. 3 Ashows the UV absorbance at 214 nm of the eluted peptides while thelower panel shows the profile of radiolabeled peptide. Two major peaks of radioactivity with retention times of 5–10 and 25–29 min and one lesser peak of radioactivity with a retention time of 20–21 min were eluted. Based on the number of basic amino acids in the hGFAT sequence, 80 tryptic peptides can be generated from hGFAT. The predicted tryptic peptides containing the PKA phosphorylation motifs with serine 205 and serine 235 have unmodified molecular masses of 911.11 and 734.80 Da, respectively, and phosphorylation would add 80 mass units to these pepti"
https://openalex.org/W2314609747,"Epstein-Barr virus is associated with a number of human proliferative and malignant diseases. It is capable of immortalizing human primary B-lymphocytes in vitro. Studies indicate that latent membrane protein LMP1 is one of the viral proteins essential for this process. In this report, LMP1 was shown to prevent primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts from entering into replicative senescence in vitro. It further suppresses the senescence-associated induction of p16INK4a, commonly believed to be a key regulator of replicative senescence. In addition, LMP1 was shown to prevent premature senescence provoked by oncogenic ras in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and to inhibit the oncogene ras-mediated induction of p16INK4a and p21WAF1. In parallel, LMP1 also prevents ras-induced premature senescence in rat embryonic fibroblasts REF52 and human diploid fibroblasts IMR90. Moreover, LMP1 is capable of suppressing the p16INK4a promoter in REF52 and Saos-2 cells in a promoter reporter assay. Our findings suggest that with the expression of p16INK4a and replicative senescence being suppressed, LMP1 may play a key role in Epstein-Barr virus-associated proliferative diseases, and it may further contribute to cancer development by preventing premature senescence induced by mitogenic oncogenes."

Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). Expression of P-gp is highest in the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and liver and in the capillaries of the brain and testes where it may function to extrude endogenous and exogenous xenobiotics. Studies on “knock-out” mice suggest that this may be the function of P-gp (2.Schinkel A.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). P-gp consists of 1280 amino acids that are organized in two tandem repeats of 610 amino acids that are joined by a linker region of about 60 amino acids. Each repeat consists of an N-terminal hydrophobic domain containing six predicted transmembrane segments followed by a hydrophilic domain containing an ATP-binding site (3.Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K.

It has been suggested that the nucleotide-binding sites function by an alternate site mechanism and show complete cooperativity (14.Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). An important aspect in understanding the mechanism of P-gp is the arrangement of the two NBDs. Recently, the crystal structure of the ATP-binding subunit (HisP) of the bacterial histidine permease complex was obtained and showed that the ATP-binding sites are oriented away from each other (15.Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). There is evidence, however, that the two predicted ATP-binding sites of P-gp may be close to each other. It has been observed that dithiothreitol (DTT) causes activation of purified mouse mdr3 P-gp (16.Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Therefore, it was proposed that the endogenous cysteine residues in the Walker A homology sequences may form disulfide bonds. In this study, we tested whether cysteine residues introduced within or close to the Walker A homology sequences could be cross-linked. The construction of the cDNA for Cys-less P-gp (all seven endogenous cysteine residues change to alanine) was described previously (4.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The cDNA was further modified to encode the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 (4.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) or to encode a (His)10 tag (13.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) at the COOH terminus of the molecule. The presence of an A52 tag facilitated detection of the mutant protein, whereas the histidine tag facilitated purification of the mutant P-gp by nickel-chelate chromatography. Cysteine residues were reintroduced into Cys-less P-gp cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis using synthetic oligonucleotides as described previously (17.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs coding for the mutant P-gps were expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence of 10 μm cyclosporin A as described previously (18.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Expression of P-gp mutants in the presence of cyclosporin A promoted maturation of the protein (19.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A is a substrate of P-gp and acts as a chemical chaperone to enhance folding of P-gp. Membranes were prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing the mutant protein and subjected to oxidative cross-linking with 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, or 1 mmCu2+(phenanthroline)3. The reactions were performed at 4, 22, or 37 °C for 10 min and then stopped by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. The samples were then treated with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide to block unreacted thiol groups. The samples were then subjected to (5.5 or 6.5%) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a sheet of nitrocellulose, and probed with monoclonal antibody A52 or with rabbit polyclonal antibody against residues 439–640 of NBD1 (20.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The methods to test for the effects of cross-linking on ATPase activity were described previously (21.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were prepared from 100 (10-cm diameter) culture plates of HEK 293 cells transfected with the mutant P-gp cDNA and grown with 10 μm cyclosporin A. Half of the membranes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 mmCu2+(phenanthroline)3, and the other half was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C without oxidant. EDTA was then added to a final concentration of 25 mm. The samples were diluted 100-fold with TBS, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The membranes were then solubilized with 1% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem), and histidine-tagged P-gp was recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography (Ni-NTA, Qiagen, Inc.) and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity as described previously (13.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Wild-type P-gp has two cysteine residues within the predicted ATP-binding sites. Residue Cys-431 is in the Walker A consensus sequence in NBD1 (GNSG C GKS; also called the phosphate-binding loop or P-loop), whereas residue Cys-1074 is in the Walker A consensus sequence in NBD2 (GSSGG C GKS) (22.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar). The P-loops are predicted to interact with the phosphate group of ATP (23.Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Following the P-loop is an α-helix that is predicted to line the ATP-binding pocket. To test if residues that are within or close to the P-loop of NBD1 are close to the P-loop of NBD2, we constructed a series of mutants containing a cysteine in NBD1 and a cysteine residue in NBD2 (TableI). One set of P-gp mutants contained Cys-431(NBD1) and a cysteine at positions 1069 to 1082 (NBD2), whereas another set of mutants had Cys-1074(NBD2) and a cysteine at positions 425 to 439 (NBD1). These mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells, and membranes were prepared for oxidative cross-linking. We have shown that P-gp mutants containing disulfide cross-links between transmembrane segments in the two halves of the molecule migrate with slower mobility in SDS gels (18.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was therefore reasonable to assume that P-gp mutants with cross-links between the NBDs would also show altered mobility in SDS gels. Such an effect was also observed with the SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase that has been cross-linked between the transmembrane segments (25.Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or within the NBD (26.Ross D.C. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12977-12983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of oxidant, mature P-gp migrates with an apparent mass of 170 kDa. Immature P-gp is also present in transfected HEK 293 cells and migrates with an apparent mass of 140 kDa. Cross-linking was detected in two mutants (Table I), G427C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) and L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2). The cross-linked product for both mutants migrated with slower mobilities in SDS gels after treatment with 0.2 mm Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 for 10 min at 37 °C (Fig. 1). Cross-linked product was not detected for P-gp mutants containing one cysteine residue at positions 427, 439, or 1074 or in the Cys-less P-gp.Table ICross-linking analysis of P-gpResidue in NBD1Cys-1074Residue in NBD2Cys-431L425C− a+, cross-linked product not detected on SDS-PAGE.V426C−V1069C−G427C+ b−, cross-linked product detected on SDS-PAGE.G1070C−N428C−S1071C−S429C−S1072C−G430C−G1073C−Cys-431−Cys-1074−G432C−G1075C−K433C−K1076C−S434C−S1077C−T435C−T1078C−T436C−V1079C−V437C−V1080C−Q438C−Q1081C−L439C+L1082CND cND, not done; protein present as 150-kDa core-glycosylated intermediate (processing mutant).Membranes were treated with 1 mm oxidant for 10 min at 37 °C.a +, cross-linked product not detected on SDS-PAGE.b −, cross-linked product detected on SDS-PAGE.c ND, not done; protein present as 150-kDa core-glycosylated intermediate (processing mutant). Open table in a new tab Membranes were treated with 1 mm oxidant for 10 min at 37 °C. The results in Fig. 1 indicated that the two predicted ATP-binding sites were close to each other. It was important, however, to confirm that cross-linking was occurring in active mutants. Therefore, histidine-tagged P-gp mutants (G427C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) and L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2)) expressed in HEK 293 cells were purified by nickel-chelate chromatography. The purified proteins were mixed with lipid and sonicated, and the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities were determined and compared with that of the Cys-less parent. Mutants (G427C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) and L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2)) had 10 and 82%, respectively, of the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp. Because mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) was more active, it was used for further analysis. Mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) was then analyzed to see if cross-linking could be detected at lower temperatures or was affected by the presence of ATP, verapamil, DTT, or MalNEt. Fig.2 A shows that the cross-linked product was detected only at 37 °C. The membranes of mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) were then cross-linked in the presence of 10 mm MgATP or 1 mm verapamil. Verapamil was chosen as the drug substrate because it is the most potent stimulator of the ATPase activity of P-gp (27.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows that the amount of cross-linked product was significantly reduced by the presence of ATP but not by the presence of verapamil. These results indicate that occupation of one or both nucleotide-binding sites blocks cross-linking. In previous cross-linking studies, we confirmed that the change in mobility of P-gp after addition of oxidant was indeed due to cross-linking by repeating the experiments with the half-molecules (18.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This was not possible with mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) because mutation L439C in the N-half molecule resulted in very low expression. We then used different approaches to show that the mobility shift after oxidative cross-linking of mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) was indeed due to disulfide bond formation. Fig. 2 C shows that the cross-linked product in mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) disappeared on addition of 10 mmDTT. This is consistent with the reduction of the disulfide bond. When membranes from mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) were pretreated with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide before addition of oxidant, no cross-linked product was detected (Fig. 2 C). It was shown that modification of either Cys-431(NBD1) or Cys-1074(NBD2) byN-ethylmaleimide inhibited the ATPase activity of P-gp (10.Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8986-8992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22957-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 28.Doige C.A., Yu, X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This result indicates that modification of Cys-1074 prevents disulfide bond formation. We then examined the effect of trypsin on the cross-linked product. Trypsin cleaves P-gp in half because of one or more trypsin-sensitive sites within or close to the linker region (29.Bruggemann E.P. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15483-15488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). If the two halves of P-gp are joined by a disulfide bond after oxidative cross-linking, then the release of the two halves of P-gp after trypsin treatment will require reduction of the disulfide bond. Fig. 2 D shows that this was indeed the case. After trypsin treatment of the cross-linked mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2), the N-half and C-half proteolytic fragments were present only after treatment with 10 mm DTT. The identity of the N-half and C-half fragments were determined using polyclonal antibody specific for the N-half, and monoclonal antibody A52 that reacts with the A52 epitope tag at the COOH-end of P-gp (data not shown). Mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) still retained 82% of the activity of Cys-less P-gp, and cross-linking could be reversed by DTT (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether cross-linking between the nucleotide-binding sites would stimulate or inhibit drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Membranes prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing histidine-tagged Cys-less P-gp or mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) were treated with or without 0.1 mmCu2+(phenanthroline)3 for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA (final concentration 2 mm), and the membranes were diluted with TBS and recovered by centrifugation. The histidine-tagged P-gps were recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography. Fig.3 A shows that treatment of membranes with oxidant did not affect recovery of histidine-tagged P-gp. It appears that the histidine tag remained accessible after cross-linking. Equivalent amounts of purified P-gps were mixed with lipid, sonicated, and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence or absence of DTT. Fig. 3 B shows that the activity of Cys-less P-gp was not greatly affected by treatment with oxidant or by the presence of DTT during the ATPase assay. In contrast, the activity of mutant L439C(NBD1)/Cys-1074(NBD2) was reduced by more than 90% after oxidative cross-linking. About 65% of the activity, however, was recovered in the presence of 10 mm DTT. This result indicates that disulfide cross-linking occurred in the active form of P-gp, and cross-linking inhibits ATPase activity. The crystal structure of the ATP-binding subunit (HisP) of histidine permease (an ABC transporter) of Salmonella typhimurium was recently reported (15.Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Histidine permease differs from P-gp in that the permease is a complex of four separate polypeptides; two transmembrane subunits, HisQ and HisM, and two copies of HisP, the ATP-binding subunit. The HisP subunits crystallize as homodimers in the presence of ATP. The phosphate groups of ATP are close to the P-loop, whereas the adenine ring is close to an α-helix that is on the COOH-terminal side of the P-loop. The ATP-binding sites face away from each other. We have attempted to use the cross-linking results to develop a model for the arrangement of the NBDs of P-gp. Fig.4 A shows the model of the arrangement of the NBDs based on the structure of HisP, where the ATP-binding sites face away from each other. Our results, however, favor the model shown in Fig. 4 B, in which the ATP-binding sites face each other. A cysteine in the P-loop of NBD1 (G427C) or in the predicted α-helix loop that immediately follows the P-loop (L439C) could form a disulfide bond with Cys-1074 in NBD2. The results indicate that at 37 °C, cysteine at positions 427 or 439 can be within 1 Å of Cys-1074. The observation that cross-linking occurred only at 37 °C suggest that some motion or flexibility exists in this region of the NBD. It is not known why the orientations of the NBDs of HisP and P-gp are so different. It is possible that the NBDs have a considerable range of motion. This may explain why cross-linking was observed only at the higher temperature. It may also be that the structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ABC transporters are indeed different or that the crystal structure is a snapshot of the “resting” phase of the reaction cycle. A combination of crystal structure information and studies such as cross-linking analysis will provide much insight into the mechanism of ABC transporters. We thank Dr. David H.

A number of studies have provided information on the fibril structure and on the factors affecting fiber formation, but the details of the fibril structure are not known. We used fluorescence quenching to investigate the solvent accessibility and surface charge of the soluble Aβ(1–40) dimer and amyloid fibrils. Analogs of Aβ(1–40) containing a single tryptophan were synthesized by substituting residues at positions 4, 10, 34, and 40 with tryptophan. Quenching measurements in the dimeric state indicate that the amino-terminal analogs (AβF4W and AβY10W) are accessible to polar quenchers, and the more carboxyl-terminal analog AβV34W is less accessible. AβV40W, on the other hand, exhibits a low degree of quenching, indicating that this residue is highly shielded from the solvent in the dimeric state. Correcting for the effect of reduced translational and rotational diffusion, fibril formation was associated with a selective increase in solvent exposure of residues 34 and 40, suggesting that a conformation change may take place in the carboxyl-terminal region coincident with the dimer to fibril transition.

Biochemical analysis of the amyloid peptides isolated from Alzheimer's disease brain indicates that amyloid β (Aβ)1 (1–42) is the principal species associated with senile plaque amyloid (1Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), whereas Aβ(1–40) is more abundant in a soluble form in cerebrospinal fluid. Synthetic Aβ(1–40) is relatively soluble, and its aggregation and assembly is a dynamic process, with a number of factors affecting the rate and equilibrium of fibril assembly (2Iversen L.L. Mortishire-Smith J.R. Pollarck J.S. Shearman S.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Key parameters promoting the assembly of amyloid fibril and sedimentable aggregates include high peptide concentration, long incubation times, low pH (pH 5–6), and mechanical agitation (3Barrow C.J.

The longer Aβ(1–42) isoform aggregates more rapidly at pH 7.4 (4Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol.

These observations suggest that aggregation of Aβ may be a critical event in pathogenesis. The amyloid fibril was shown to be a β-pleated sheet structure using x-ray diffraction (6Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These studies established that the amyloid fibril is made of an orthogonal lattice of β-crystallites having unit dimensions of 9.4 Å in a hydrogen bond direction, 7 Å in the polypeptide backbone direction, and 10 Å inter-sheet spacing, arranged in a cylindrical fashion (6Kirschner D.A.

The peptide is organized in a cross β pattern in which the hydrogen bonding direction is parallel to the fiber axis. The Aβ(1–40) sequence is divided in two regions. Residues 1–28 make up a relatively hydrophilic domain with a high proportion of charged residues (46%). In the amyloid precursor protein, this domain is extracellular. The carboxyl-terminal 28–40 residues make up a richly hydrophobic domain that is associated with the cell membrane in the amyloid precursor protein (2Iversen L.L. Mortishire-Smith J.R. Pollarck J.S. Shearman S.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Replacement of hydrophobic residues by hydrophilic residues markedly stabilizes Aβ peptides against aggregation (8Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), whereas replacement of hydrophilic residues by hydrophobic residues alters the morphology of the fibril, suggesting that hydrophilic residues are largely responsible for the specificity of intermolecular interaction within the fibril (8Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibril formation may involve two basic steps, the initial nucleation of aggregates that establishes the amyloid fibril lattice (6Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), followed by the elongation of the fibril by the sequential addition of subunits (9Maggio J.E. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Allen C.J.

However, much remains to be elucidated regarding the structure of the amyloid fibril and the mechanism of amyloid dimer-fibril transition. In this work, fluorescence spectroscopy was used to assess solvent exposure and surface charge around discrete sites along the peptidyl backbone of Aβ(1–40) in both the dimeric and fibrillar states. Specifically, a functional set of single-residue Trp replacement analogs of Aβ(1–40) was synthesized, and the capacity of cationic Cs+, anionic I−, and neutral acrylamide to dynamically quench the emission from the substituted Trps in these analogs was measured (20Barry J.K. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15632-15642Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Determining which parts of Aβ are accessible to the solvent and how these environments change during polymerization will be important to understand how the peptide is organized within the fiber and to identify critical contact sites that are necessary for higher order assembly into fibrils.

A single tryptophan residue was substituted into the sequence of the Aβ(1–40) peptide at positions 4 (AβF4W), 10 (AβY10W), 34 (AβL34W), and 40 (AβV40W). The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purity and expected structure was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. Only peptides exhibiting 90.0% or greater purity with less than 5.0% of a single contaminant were used. All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade commercially available. Aggregation was determined by using a sedimentation assay as described previously (4Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol.

Aβ(1–40) (75 μm) was mixed with the tryptophan analogs of Aβ(1–40) (5 μm) in either 0.1 m NaAc, pH 5.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, or 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (70 μmZnCl2) and incubated for 48 h at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Afterward, the amount of fluorescence in both the supernatant and pellet was determined by measuring the intensity of tyrosine fluorescence for wild type Aβ(1–40) (λex = 280 nm and λem = 310 nm) or tryptophan fluorescence for Trp-analogs (λex = 295 nm and λem = 350 nm). Gel filtration analysis was performed with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column. The peptides were detected by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The mobile phase was 50 mm Tris-HCl/0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (Buffer A) with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The standards used to calibrate the column were thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (23 kDa), ubiquitin (8.5 kDa), and acetone (0.058 kDa). Fibril formation was monitored using a thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay (14LeVine III, H. Protein. Sci. 1993; 2: 04-410Crossref Scopus (1954) Google Scholar, 15LeVine III, H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The peptides (230 μm) were incubated for 24 h at room temperature in 50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, with continuous stirring. After 24 h, 10-μl aliquots of each sample were transferred to a cuvette containing 2 ml of 3 μmThT, pH 7.4. The fluorescence emission was monitored at 482 nm with excitation at 450 nm using a Spex Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer. For electron microscopy analysis, the peptides were incubated for 24 h at room temperature with continuous stirring, at a concentration of 230 μm in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. A drop of each sample was placed on a carbon coated copper grid, negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, and visualized with a Zeiss 10CR microscope (80 kV). Fluorescence spectra were measured with an Aminco SLM 4800 spectrofluorometer. Tryptophan emission from of the Aβ(1–40) Trp analogs was recorded between 310 and 550 nm, with excitation at 295 nm. Fluorescence lifetimes were determined by the time-correlated single photon counting technique using an EEY scientific nanosecond fluorescence spectrofluorometer (La Jolla, CA), equipped with an IBH hydrogen arc lamp (Glasgow, United Kingdom). Emission decays were analyzed with the GLOBALS UNLIMITED computer program (version 1.01; Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics, Urbana-Champaign, IL). Steady-state fluorescence quenching experiments were performed using two different conditions: with the dimeric and fibrillar peptides. For the dimer, aliquots of the stock quenching solutions (5 m) were added into a 0.5 × 0.5-cm cuvette containing 10 μm of the peptide in Buffer A (0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). For the fibrillar state measurements, the peptides (230 μm) were previously incubated for 24 h in Buffer A with continuous stirring. Steady-state quenching experiments were performed with excitation at 295 nm, emission at 350 nm. Corrections were made for dilution. Stock quenching solutions of KI, acrylamide, and CsCl were freshly prepared at 5 m. Quenching data were fit to the Stern-Volmer equation,Fo/F=1+KSV[Q]Equation 1 where Fo and F are the fluorescence intensity in the absence and in the presence of quencher [Q], respectively, K SV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. The apparent bimolecular quenching rate constant, kq , a measure of solute accessibility, was calculated with the following expression,kq=KSV/〈τ〉Equation 2 where <τ> is the geometric average fluorescence lifetime obtained from time-resolved measurements (16Lakowicz J.R.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6586-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To validate the utility of the quenching experiments employing Aβ substitution analogs, the aggregation properties of the Trp substitution analogs were characterized. Aβ(1–40) was chosen for these studies because its dimeric state is stable over the time frame of the experiments and the transition to the fibrillar state can be accomplished by stirring the peptide for 24 h under the same physiological conditions (10Soreghan B.

The oligomeric assembly state of the amyloid tryptophan analogs was characterized by gel filtration chromatography. The peptides eluted at the same position as wild type Aβ(1–40) (Fig.1). The elution position corresponded to an apparent molecular mass of 9 kDa, determined by the elution behavior of a series of calibration standards as reported previously (8Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B.

The other tryptophan analogs used in this study also eluted as a dimer (data not shown). Aggregation was determined using a sedimentation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The aggregation properties of the tryptophan analogs and wild type Aβ(1–40) are shown in Fig.2, under several conditions that are known to modulate the assembly state of Aβ. At pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of zinc ions, and at pH 5.0, the sedimentation behavior of all of the tryptophan analogs used is comparable to wild type Aβ(1–40). Several other substitution analogs were synthesized, but they exhibited significantly altered aggregation properties and were not studied further (data not shown). Thioflavin T binding assays were also used to follow the progress of amyloid fibril formation for the tryptophan analogs. In comparison to the wild type Aβ(1–40), all the tryptophan analogs were able to bind thioflavin T as judged by the high fluorescence, but AβY10W showed a significantly lower fluorescence (Fig.3). To further verify the fibril forming properties of the tryptophan analogs, their structures were examined by electron microscopy. Electron microscopy indicated that the tryptophan analogs AβY10W and AβL34W form fibrils that are indistinguishable from wild type amyloid fibrils (Fig. 4). The other two tryptophan analogs were also able to form morphologically normal fibrils (data not shown). The fact that AβY10W displays a low yield of fluorescence in the ThT assay but forms morphologically normal fibrils suggests that tyrosine 10 may play a critical role in ThT binding.Figure 4AβY10W and AβL34W Trp analogs exhibit fibrillar morphology by transmission electron microscopy. Negatively stained fibrils formed by all Aβ(1–40) tryptophan analogs exhibited similar morphology to wild type under electron microscopy. Representative fibrils from AβY10W (A) and AβL34W (B) are shown here.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The assembly of a polypeptide chain such as Aβ(1–40) to form a relatively stable dimer or a fibril is frequently associated with the shielding of certain amino acid residues from the external aqueous environment. Other residues lie on the surface, where they are exposed to the polar solvent. We employed a strategy often used in studying the solution structure of proteins or peptides to map those residues that are exposed and those that are buried in the dimeric and fibrillar Aβ(1–40). The exposure of the single tryptophan moiety in different peptide assembly states was measured by using neutral, anionic, and cationic quenchers for each of the Aβ(1–40) analogs. Stern-Volmer plots of fluorescence quenching of Aβ(1–40) tryptophan analogs are shown in Fig. 5 for dimeric and fibrillar peptides with three different quenchers. The lines in Fig. 5were obtained by fitting the data to the Stern-Volmer equation. Linear Stern-Volmer plots (linear correlation coefficients >0.98) indicated that the quenching was dynamic and that no detectable static quenching occurred. Table I summarizes the collisional quenching parameters for the four tryptophan analogs in both dimeric and fibrillar states with iodide, cesium, and acrylamide quenchers: Stern-Volmer quenching constant (K SV), the bimolecular quenching rate constant (kq), and the fluorescence lifetime (τ).Table IFluorescence quenching parameters for dimeric and fibrillar Aβ(1–40) tryptophan analogsλemτAcrylamideKICsClKSVkq × 10−9KSVkq × 10−9KSVkq × 10−9nmnsm−1m−1s−1m−1m−1s−1m−1m−1s−1DimerAβF4W3502.17.2 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.061.6 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.050.5 ± 0.1AβY10W3502.37.6 ± 0.093.3 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.131.0 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.10.52 ± 0.2AβL34W3502.04.7 ± 0.142.4 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.050.35 ± 0.2AβV40W3463.01.9 ± 0.070.62 ± 0.051.2 ± 0.050.36 ± 0.050.4 ± 0.030.13 ± 0.04FiberAβF4W3482.13.8 ± 0.121.8 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.070.28 ± 0.031.2 ± 0.040.57 ± 0.1AβY10W3481.62.4 ± 0.021.5 ± 0.16.0 ± 0.173.8 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.090.89 ± 0.2AβL34W3481.44.3 ± 0.093.1 ± 0.33.2 ± 0.152.3 ± 0.30.6 ± 0.090.42 ± 0.2AβV40W3461.55.0 ± 0.183.3 ± 0.40.6 ± .040.39 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.070.026 ± 0.04Fluorescence emission intensities were recorded from each analog at varying concentrations of acrylamide, KI, or CsCl.

Acrylamide is a polar, uncharged dynamic quenching agent that in an aqueous phase interacts with all surfaces, independent of charge. Consequently, for proteins and peptides, the biomolecular quenching rate constant (kq) for acrylamide quenching of tryptophan emission is a measure solvent exposure of tryptophan residues. Merril et al. (21Merril A.R. Palmer L.R. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6974-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) reported that acrylamide quenching of NATA in aqueous solution was highly efficient (kq = 8–8.5m−1 ns–1). With acrylamide, the degree of Trp solvent exposure to solvent is defined by Merrill et al. (21Merril A.R. Palmer L.R. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6974-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as follows: exposed to the solvent, 1.5 < kq < 5; moderately exposed, 0.6 <kq < 1.5; moderately buried, 0.2 <kq < 0.6; and buried, kq < 0.2. With acrylamide as a quenching agent, the kq values for the dimeric AβF4W, AβY10W, and AβL34W (3.5, 3.3, and 2.4, respectively) indicated significant solvent exposure but only moderate exposure for AβV40W (kq = 0.6m−1ns−1). In good agreement with the Aβ(1–42) dimeric model (22Chaney M.O., S.D. Webter Y.M. Kuo Roher A.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which only two amino acids (Val-36 and Val-40) contribute to the hydrophobic core, the rest of the side chains are exposed to the aqueous environment. These same analogs were also analyzed in the fibrillar state. Formation of fibrils should be associated with about a 50% reduction in kq, as the fluorophore in the much larger fibril will have dramatically lower translational and rotational diffusion rates (31Johnson D.A. Yguerabide J. Biophys. J. 1985; 48: 949-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As expected if just the diffusion rates decrease without any change in the solvent exposure at positions 4 and 10, the kq values decreased about 50% upon fibril formation for acrylamide quenching of AβF4W and AβY10W (Table I and Fig.6). In contrast, the kq values increased 29 and 450% for AβL34W and AβV40W, respectively, indicating an increase in the solvent exposure for these analogs, especially at position 40. The surface charge surrounding the tryptophan residues in the Aβ(1–40) tryptophan analogs was assessed by employing ionic quenchers. The capacity of anionic iodide to quench tryptophan emission is affected by both solvent exposure and the surface charge adjacent to the indole moiety of the tryptophan (19Choo-Smith L-P. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22987-22990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18Eftnik M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). In the absence of surface charge effects, kq values for iodide quenching of tryptophan greater than 1.5 are indicative of high solvent exposure, whereas kq values less than 1.5 are indicative of partially exposed tryptophans (20Barry J.K. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15632-15642Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The relative susceptibility of the substituted tryptophans in the dimeric peptides to iodide quenching is similar to that observed with acrylamide and suggests that surface charge has little effect on the iodide quenching (Table I and Fig.6). The formation of fibrils was associated with differential changes in the surface charge adjacent to the substituted tryptophans. Correcting for the effect of reduced translational and rotational diffusion (31Johnson D.A. Yguerabide J. Biophys. J. 1985; 48: 949-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), fibrillar AβY4W should have been associated with akq value of ∼0.8 nm−1 s−1, whereas the observed value was significantly lower, 0.3 nm−1 s−1, suggesting a small fibrillar formation-induced increase in the negative surface charge near position 4. Similarly, if only translational and rotational diffusion rates changed upon fibril formation, then the kq values for the AβY10W, AβL34W, and AβL40W should have been 0.8, 0.5, and 0.2 nm−1 s−1, respectively. However, the kq values were observed to be significantly higher, 3.8, 2.3, and 0.4 nm−1 s−1, respectively (Table I and Fig. 6), suggesting an increase in the positive surface charge near positions 10, 34, and 40 following fibril formation. Although the kq values for cesium quenching of the dimeric analogs are 80–86% less than the respectivekq values for acrylamide quenching, their rank order is the essentially same as that of acrylamide (AβY4W ≈ AβY10W > AβL34W ≫ AβL40W) (Table I). This suggests that the surface charge about each substituted tryptophan has little effect on cesium quenching of the dimeric analogs and that cesium is intrinsically a less efficient tryptophan quencher than acrylamide. Fibril formation was associated with differential effects on the capacity of cesium to quench the emission from the substituted tryptophan analogs. Assuming that there were no changes in the surface charge upon fibril formation and that the only changes in quenching are due to reduced translational and rotational diffusion (31Johnson D.A. Yguerabide J. Biophys. J. 1985; 48: 949-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the cesiumkq values should have been about 0.25, 0.26, 0.18, and 0.07 nm−1s−1 for AβY4W, AβY10W, AβL34W, and AβL40W, respectively. However, the observed kqvalues for the AβY4W, AβY10W, and AβL34W analogs were 2.3–3.4 times higher and 2.5 times lower for the AβL40W analog that what would be expected if there were changes in surface charge around the substituted tryptophans upon fibril formation (Table I and Fig. 6). This suggests that fibril formation is associated with an increased negative charge around positions 4, 10, and 34 and an increase in positive charge around position 40. These results are only partially consistent with the iodide quenching results. Whereas both the iodide and cesium results indicated increase negative surface charge around position 4 and increased negative charge around position 40, the iodide suggested increased positive and the cesium increased negative surface charge around positions 10 and 34. Collectively, the cesium and iodide quenching results would indicate that fibril formation was associated with a homogeneous increases in negative surface charge around position 4 and positive surface charge around position 40 but inhomogeneous increase in both positive and negative charge around positions 10 and 34. The primary objective of the present work was to map the solvent-accessible surface of Aβ(1–40) in the dimeric and fibrillar states by using fluorescent quenching analysis. The aromatic amino acids that are present at positions 4 and 10 (Phe and Tyr) of Aβ(1–40) were substituted with a tryptophan. Hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal residues 34 and 40 (Met and Val) were also substituted with tryptophan. Substitution of the other aromatic residues at positions 19 and 20 significantly inhibited the aggregation of the peptides and were not studied further. 2W. Garzon-Rodriguez, A. Vega, M.

This general strategy has been used to study the structure and function of proteins and peptides from which the Trp aromatic amino acid is absent (21Merril A.R. Palmer L.R. Szabo A.G.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17649-17654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to study ligand dependent changes in the accessibility of P-glycoprotein induced by different antitumor agents by using quenching analysis. They found that upon addition of the substrate, the enzyme adopts a different tertiary structure, resulting in a significantly increased solvent accessibility. The single tryptophan analogs examined in this work can be classified into two groups on the basis of their sensitivity to collisional quenchers: exposed and minimally exposed. Tryptophan residues in dimeric AβF4W, AβY10W, and AβL34W are exposed and display high bimolecular quenching rate constants with acrylamide and iodide (Fig.6). Comparison of the degree of quenching of these residues with iodide and cesium indicates that in the dimeric state, residues 4 and 10 are surrounded by positively and negatively charged amino acids. This is in good agreement with the published model of the Aβ dimer (22Chaney M.O., S.D. Webter Y.M. Kuo Roher A.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which the negatively charged residues (Asp-1, Glu-3, Asp-7, Glu-11, and Asp-23) are on the surface of the molecule, and the basic residues (His-13, His-14, and Lys-16) represent a positively charged domain on both outer surfaces of the participating β sheets. This positively charged cluster appears to participate in the activation of microglia (28Guilian D. Haverkamp L.J., Yu, J. Karshin W. Tom D. Li J. Kikpatrick J. Kuo Y-M Roher A.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6021-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are involved in the inflammatory response to Aβ observed in Alzheimer's disease. However, the tryptophan residue in dimeric AβV40W seems to be relatively inaccessible to the solvent. The carboxyl-terminal residues 28–40 constitute a richly hydrophobic domain. Accompanying the transition to the fibrillar state, Aβ tryptophan analogs at positions 4 and 10 are less exposed, consistent with this region participating in assembly as a contact site. Residues 10 and 34 are surrounded by both positive and negative charges, position 4 by primarily negative charges, and position 40 by positive charges. The tryptophan residue at position 40 is highly exposed to the solvent in the fibrillar state but is significantly less exposed in the dimeric state (Fig. 6). The measurements described in this paper clearly suggest that this change in exposure is indicative of a conformational change that occurs in this region accompanying the dimer to fibril transition, which may be an important step in amyloid assembly. The existence of such a conformational change could be due to the involvement of distinct peptide domains in the association of amyloid dimers, which eventually lead to higher order aggregates and subsequent fibril formation. This observation of a conformation change is consistent with previous studies of the temperature dependence of fibril formation, which suggested such a conformational change on the basis of the unusually high activation energy for the transition (29Kusumoto Y. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12277-12282Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Although these studies were conducted in 0.1 m HCl, we also find evidence of a conformational change under more physiological conditions. Our data further indicate that this conformation change takes place at the carboxyl terminus. This conformation change may confound attempts to elucidate the structure of the Aβ peptide in amyloid fibrils, because most of the molecular models have assumed that no change in conformation takes place after initial dimerization (22Chaney M.O., S.D. Webter Y.M. Kuo Roher A.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tjernberg L.O. Callaway D.J.E. Tjernberg A. Hahne S. Lilliehook C. Teranius L. Thyberg J. Nordstedt C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2073913152,"The molecular adapter Grb7 is likely to be implicated in the development of certain cancer types. In this study we show that Grb7 binds the insulin receptors, when they are activated and tyrosine phosphorylated. This interaction is documented by two-hybrid experiments, GST pull-down assays and in vivo coimmunoprecipitations. In addition, our results argue in favor of a preferential association between Grb7 and the insulin receptors when compared to other tyrosine kinase receptors like the EGF receptor, the FGF receptor and Ret. Interestingly, Grb7 is not a substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Grb7 binds the activated tyrosine kinase loop of the insulin receptors. Two domains of Grb7 are implicated in the insulin receptor binding: the SH2 domain and the PIR (phosphotyrosine interacting region). The role of these two domains in the interaction with the insulin receptor was already reported for Grb10 and Grb14, the other members of the Grb7 family of proteins. However, the relative importance of these domains varies, considering the receptor and the Grb protein. These differences should be a determinant of the specificity of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Grbs binding, and thus of the implication of Grb7/10/14 in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1999120412,"Enamel biomineralization is a complex process that involves interactions between extracellular matrix proteins. To identify proteins interacting with tuftelin, a potential nucleator of enamel crystallites, the yeast two-hybrid system was applied to a mouse tooth expression library and atuftelin-interacting protein (TIP) was isolated for further characterization. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared against two recombinant variants of this protein. Both antibodies identified a major protein product in tooth organs at 39 kDa, and this protein has been called TIP39. Northern analysis showed TIP39 messenger RNA in multiple organs, a pattern similar to that of tuftelin messenger RNA. In situ hybridization of mandibles of 1-day-old mice detected TIP39 RNA in secretory ameloblasts and odontoblasts. Immunolocalization of TIP39 and tuftelin in cultured ameloblast-like cells showed that these two proteins colocalize. Within the developing tooth organ, TIP39 and tuftelin immunolocalized to the apical pole of secretory ameloblasts (Tomes' processes) and to the newly secreted extracellular enamel matrix. TIP39 amino acid sequence appears to be highly conserved with similarities to proteins in species as diverse as yeast and primates. Available sequence data and the findings reported here suggest a role for TIP39 in the secretory pathway of extracellular proteins. Enamel biomineralization is a complex process that involves interactions between extracellular matrix proteins. To identify proteins interacting with tuftelin, a potential nucleator of enamel crystallites, the yeast two-hybrid system was applied to a mouse tooth expression library and atuftelin-interacting protein (TIP) was isolated for further characterization. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared against two recombinant variants of this protein. Both antibodies identified a major protein product in tooth organs at 39 kDa, and this protein has been called TIP39. Northern analysis showed TIP39 messenger RNA in multiple organs, a pattern similar to that of tuftelin messenger RNA. In situ hybridization of mandibles of 1-day-old mice detected TIP39 RNA in secretory ameloblasts and odontoblasts. Immunolocalization of TIP39 and tuftelin in cultured ameloblast-like cells showed that these two proteins colocalize. Within the developing tooth organ, TIP39 and tuftelin immunolocalized to the apical pole of secretory ameloblasts (Tomes' processes) and to the newly secreted extracellular enamel matrix. TIP39 amino acid sequence appears to be highly conserved with similarities to proteins in species as diverse as yeast and primates. Available sequence data and the findings reported here suggest a role for TIP39 in the secretory pathway of extracellular proteins. tuftelin-interacting protein polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase-PCR kilobase Enamel is the bioceramic composite covering of vertebrate teeth that is unique in many ways (1.Fincham A.G.

Soc. 2000; 83: 238-240Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unlike most mesenchyme-derived, collagen-based biomineralized tissues, enamel is created by an ectoderm-derived cell lineage, ameloblasts (3.Smith C. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Ameloblasts synthesize and secrete an organic extracellular matrix that is devoid of collagen (4.Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 175-188Google Scholar). Moreover, the matrix is proteolytically destroyed and removed by ameloblasts while being simultaneously replaced by inorganic carbonated hydroxyapatite crystallites, a process that creates the hardest tissue in the vertebrate body (5.Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 84-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).The most abundant protein of the forming enamel is amelogenin, a family of hydrophobic proteins that are synthesized in response to a cascade of signals, elicited as part of the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that characterize all developmental aspects of odontogenesis (6.Snead M.L.

Amelogenin has been shown to undergo self-assembly into nanospheres, some 20-nm spheroid structures that are interspersed among the long hydroxyapatite crystals (17.Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Diekwisch T.G.H. Lyaruu D.M. Wright J.T. Bringas Jr., P. Slavkin H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The relationship of the other enamel proteins to the abundant amelogenin nanospheres, if any, is not yet appreciated. However, tuftelin has been postulated to serve a role in crystallite nucleation based on its physicochemical characteristics, as well as its localization to the newly secreted enamel matrix (4.Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 175-188Google Scholar,18.Zeichner-David M. Vo H. Tan H. Diekwisch T. Berman B. Theimann F. Alcocer M.D. Hsu P. Wang T. Enya J. Caton J. Slavkin H.C. MacDougall M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 27-38PubMed Google Scholar).Organizing the enamel extracellular matrix is thought to be largely a process of self-assembly since it occurs in the extracellular milieu. We have shown (19.Paine M.L. Krebsbach P.H. Chen L.S. Paine C.T. Yamada Y. Deutsch D. Snead M.L. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that amelogenin and tuftelin each have the capacity for self-assembly but do not appear to interact with one another. Our strategy was to use the yeast two-hybrid assay to search for previously unknown proteins that participate in organizing the enamel extracellular matrix based on the supposition that such proteins may play critical roles during replacement by the inorganic crystallites. By using tuftelin as a bait protein, we identified several tuftelin-interacting proteins (TIP)1 (20.Paine C.T. Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1998; 38: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the developing tooth, a tuftelin-interactingprotein, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately39 kDa (TIP39) was localized to the apical portion of the secretory ameloblasts, a location that may exert considerable influence on enamel protein secretion and assembly, suggesting that TIP39 plays a role in amelogenesis.DISCUSSIONEnamel formation is unique in that an almost completely mineralized tissue replaces a protein matrix produced by the secretory ameloblast cells. To date amelogenins, tuftelin, ameloblastin, and enamelin have been implicated in the process of enamel biomineralization. Tuftelin-interacting proteins (TIPs) may represent an additional class of proteins essential to enamel matrix secretion and subsequent enamel crystallite formation (20.Paine C.T. Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1998; 38: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Support for the TIPs playing a role in tooth formation can be seen in the TIP mRNA expression profiles in cells of tooth lineage, notably ameloblasts and odontoblasts (20.Paine C.T. Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1998; 38: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ability of the TIPs to interact directly with tuftelin suggests that protein to protein interactions may play a general role in the assembly of the enamel extracellular matrix and during enamel biomineralization. In this study, TIP39 mRNA is localized to the ameloblasts as is evident by in situhybridization. TIP39 mRNA is also evident in odontoblasts, and lesser amounts of TIP39 mRNA are seen in the cells of the stratum intermedium. TIP39 mRNA appears to be present as two isoforms, one at 3.1 kb and the other at 3.9 kb. The larger mouse TIP39 isoform is similar in size (within experimental error) to its human homologue. The smaller isoform may indicate another transcript with high homology to TIP39 or to an alternatively spliced or post-transcriptionally modified TIP39 message. Post-transcriptional processing may explain the disparity between TIP39's theoretical open reading frame of 96.8 kDa (for its human homologue) and our Western data suggesting that TIP39 codes a translated product of 39 kDa. TIP39 mRNA is expressed as early as E14 and continues into postnatal development.The pattern of expression of the recombinant TIP39 antibody (Fig. 4,C and D) is similar to that seen for antibodies directed to bovine tuftelin (Fig. 4 E). At two days postnatal (Fig. 4, C, D and E), it appears that TIP39 and tuftelin colocalize to the apical region of the ameloblasts, to an area known as Tomes' processes. These results support our previous notion that TIP39 has a particular function in the cell cytoskeleton (20.Paine C.T. Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1998; 38: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protein localization data suggest that TIP39 may be involved in the transport or secretion of enamel proteins into the extracellular matrix. These observations are consistent with TIP39 being ubiquitously expressed, being part of the cell secretory machinery, having a physical interaction with tuftelin, and showing colocalization with tuftelin within the enamel matrix. This also predicts that TIP39 may have an influence on the intracellular transport of amelogenin. What remains difficult to explain for both TIP39 and tuftelin is their apparent extracellular location, as neither protein sequence contains a recognizable leader peptide. Despite the lack of a leader peptide, the presence of tuftelin and TIP39 in the extracellular matrix can be explained in the following way. Secretory ameloblasts appear to shed part of their Tomes' processes, including membrane phospholipids (32.Goldberg M. LeColle S. Bissila-Mapahou P. Septier D. Carreau J.P. Adv. Den. Res. 1996; 10: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,33.Goldberg M. Lecolle S. Vermelin L. Benghezal A. Godeau G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1999; 65: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Intentional deposition of protein and lipid into the developing enamel, and in particular at the rod and interod boundaries, may serve to pattern the enamel extracellular matrix and/or could act as a boundary to mechanical stresses. Alternatively, the tuftelin·TIP complexes may play a role in anchoring ameloblasts to the dentine-enamel junction or anchoring ameloblasts to the enamel matrix itself. Such a protein complex may be shed during rapid secretory activity and thus be incorporated into the enamel matrix.In an attempt to identify a function for TIP39, a search of the gene data bases was performed. The human homologue is located on chromosome 22q12.1, a region devoid of any known defects in mammalian physiology, and thus it is uninformative. In addition to the human homologue of TIP39, three other genes had significant amino acid similarities. The first was a Drosophila melanogaster gene of unknown or undocumented function (GenBankTM accession numberAF145670). The second was a Caenorhabditis elegans gene, also of unknown function (document identification 3874094), that was characterized during work on the C. elegans Genome Sequencing Project (34.Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Favello A. Frazer A. Fulton L. Gardner G. Green P. Hawkins T. Hillier L. Jler M. Johnston L. Jones M. Kershaw J. Kirsten J. Laisster N. Latreille P. Lightning J. Lloyd C. Mortimore B. O'Callaghan M. Parsons J. Percy C. Rifken L. Roopra A. Saunders D. Shownkeen R. Sims M. Smaldon N. Smith A. Smith M. Sonnhammer E. Staden R. Sulston J. Thierry-Mieg J. Thomas K. Vaudin M. Vaughan K. Waterston R. Weinstock L. Wilkinson-Sproat J. Wohidman P. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). The third gene is a yeast protein (GenBankTM accession number Q09837) identified as an integral membrane protein. By using the ClustalW Formatted Alignment software (35.Karlin S. Altschul S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2264-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) a striking pattern of similarities among the TIP39 homologues began to emerge (Table IV). The similarities at the amino acid level suggest that four (e.g. mouse, human, fly, and worm, see Table IV) of the five genes may be homologues and may serve similar functions in these disparate organisms. The fifth gene, the yeast membrane protein, although not an obvious homologue of TIP39, may belong to the same gene family with its encoded protein product serving a similar function. These findings suggest that TIP39 may act as a membrane-bound protein and may participate in the secretion of cell-specific proteins.Initial DNA sequence homology searches for TIP39 indicated that TIP39 shared weak similarity with the human clathrin heavy chain (20.Paine C.T. Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1998; 38: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At the protein level, TIP39 and its human homologue have a number of protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 phosphorylation sites similar to clathrin (36.Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 37.Pinna L.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other observations that draw our attention to clathrin for comparisons are that both TIP39 and the clathrin heavy and clathrin light chains have Myc-type “helix-loop-helix” dimerization domains (38.Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) (Table IV). Finally, TIP39 contains a clathrin-binding motif (LIDM) at its carboxyl terminus (39.Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) that may be suggestive of a functional interaction between TIP39 and clathrin.A protein analysis of mouse TIP39 and its human homologue was performed, and coiled-coil motifs were predicted (40.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). For mouse TIP39, the coiled-coils were suggested at the amino-terminal region and at the carboxyl-terminal region (Table IV). In the human protein these coiled-coil regions approximately equated to amino acids 300–400 and amino acids 700–750 (Table IV). In addition, the human protein has another predicted coiled-coil region within amino acids 200–240 (TableIV). Mouse and bovine tuftelin proteins also have predicted coiled-coil regions. This may imply that tuftelin and TIP39 have assembly or self-assembly properties because helical protein domains such as coiled-coils tend to associate with like domains (41.Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd. Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1988: 27Google Scholar). Tuftelin self-assembly has previously been demonstrated at the coiled-coil domain (19.Paine M.L. Krebsbach P.H. Chen L.S. Paine C.T. Yamada Y. Deutsch D. Snead M.L. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31.Paine M.L. Deutsch D. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 35: 157-161Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interaction among coiled-coil domains may also explain the interactions observed between tuftelin and TIP39.Deletion experiments were conducted in the yeast two-hybrid assay in order to determine the protein domains involved in the protein-protein interaction between TIP39 and tuftelin. Both mouse-derived and bovine-derived tuftelin interact with TIP39. For mouse tuftelin, the ability to interact with TIP39 could be defined within the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 294–390 of tuftelin. Amino acid similarities between mouse tuftelin (16.MacDougall M. Simmons D. Dodds A. Knight C. Luan X. Zeichner-David M. Zhang C. Ryu O.H. Qian Q. Simmer J.P. Hu C.C. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and bovine tuftelin (22.Deutsch D. Palmon A. Fisher L.W. Kolodny N. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16021-16028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) exist up to, but not beyond, amino acid number 348. Therefore, it seems likely that the domain of tuftelin responsible for the interaction is contained entirely within 55 amino acids (e.g. amino acid residues 294–348 of mouse tuftelin, Table II). Furthermore, amino acid residues 294–348 of mouse tuftelin contain a predicted coiled-coil region (Table IV) (40.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). This 55-amino acid binding domain of mouse tuftelin relates closely to the bovine tuftelin self-assembly domain defined previously (31.Paine M.L. Deutsch D. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 35: 157-161Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and suggests that this may be a multifunctional structural region of the tuftelin gene product. In contrast, when portions of TIP39 cDNA were deleted, they did not result in protein products capable of interacting with tuftelin. These results are consistent with the tertiary or quaternary structure of TIP39 influencing its ability to bind to tuftelin.Enamel formation results from unique molecular activities occurring both at the intracellular and extracellular levels. The cloning of andin situ gene expression patterns for the TIPs in this study (20.Paine C.T. Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1998; 38: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have contributed to this growing list of proteins that are differentially expressed in odontogenic tissues. Additional discovery and characterization of enamel matrix proteins can only help to define further odontogenesis and enhance our understanding of these complex events. Prior to secreting tooth extracellular matrix proteins, ameloblasts and odontoblasts must define their roles and coordinate their activities. Regulation and organization of enamel are determined by the timing of expression and the quantities of the proteins that comprise the enamel organic matrix. Enamel matrix proteins are produced principally by the ameloblasts, but neighboring cells, including the odontoblasts, also contribute to the enamel organic matrix, especially at the dentine-enamel junction. Specific intracellular proteins may act as chaperones to coordinate secretory events, serve as elements within regulatory pathways, or provide structure within the cytoskeleton. Ultimately, whether TIP39 is located intracellularly or extracellularly, its function may be critical to the differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts or to the forming enamel extracellular matrix. The organization of this extracellular organic matrix may in turn be reflected in the resulting enamel mineral structure. By determining the roles of TIPs and other tooth-related proteins, we may better understand the synchronized events of enamel biogenesis. Enamel is the bioceramic composite covering of vertebrate teeth that is unique in many ways (1.Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 32: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2.White S.N. Paine M.L. Sarikaya M. Fong H., Yu, Z. Li Z.C. Snead M.L. J. Am. Ceram.

At two days postnatal (Fig. 4, C, D and E), it appears that TIP39 and tuftelin colocalize to the apical region of the ameloblasts, to an area known as Tomes' processes. These results support our previous notion that TIP39 has a particular function in the cell cytoskeleton (20.Paine C.T. Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1998; 38: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protein localization data suggest that TIP39 may be involved in the transport or secretion of enamel proteins into the extracellular matrix. These observations are consistent with TIP39 being ubiquitously expressed, being part of the cell secretory machinery, having a physical interaction with tuftelin, and showing colocalization with tuftelin within the enamel matrix. This also predicts that TIP39 may have an influence on the intracellular transport of amelogenin. What remains difficult to explain for both TIP39 and tuftelin is their apparent extracellular location, as neither protein sequence contains a recognizable leader peptide. Despite the lack of a leader peptide, the presence of tuftelin and TIP39 in the extracellular matrix can be explained in the following way. Secretory ameloblasts appear to shed pa"

Interleukin (IL)-10 suppresses macrophage activation and down-regulates proinflammatory cytokine production, but there are no available data to suggest a link between IL-10, thrombosis, and fibrinolysis in the setting of I/R. We hypothesized that hypoxia/ischemia triggers IL-10 production, to dampen proinflammatory cytokine and adhesion receptor cascades and to restore vascular patency by fibrinolytic potentiation. Studies were performed in a mouse lung I/R model. IL-10 mRNA levels in lung were increased 43-fold over base line by 1 h of ischemia/2 h of reperfusion, with a corresponding increase in plasma IL-10. Expression was prominently localized in bronchial epithelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes. To study the link between IL-10 and fibrinolysis in vivo, the induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was evaluated. Northern analysis demonstrated exaggerated pulmonary PAI-1 expression in IL-10 (−/−) mice after I/R, with a corresponding increase in plasma PAI/tissue-type plasminogen activator activity. In vivo, IL-10 (−/−) mice showed poor postischemic lung function and survival after I/R compared with IL-10 (+/+) mice. Despite a decrease in infiltration of mononuclear phagocytes in I/R lungs of IL-10 (−/−) mice, an increased intravascular pulmonary fibrin deposition was observed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, along with increased IL-1 expression. Recombinant IL-10 given to IL-10 (−/−) mice normalized the PAI/tissue-type plasminogen activator ratio, reduced pulmonary vascular fibrin deposition, and rescued mice from lung injury. Since recombinant hirudin (direct thrombin inhibitor) also sufficed to rescue IL-10 (−/−) mice, these data suggest a preeminent role for microvascular thrombosis in I/R lung injury.

Lung failure associated with I/R is characterized by increased microvascular permeability, pulmonary vascular resistance with subsequent edema formation and impairment of gas exchange, and microembolism. The lungs are particularly susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion injury, presumably due to the rich vascularity of the lungs and the relatively large surface area over which blood-borne components can interact with endothelium. The proximate mechanisms of ischemic lung injury are diverse and include leukocyte activation and recruitment (1.Naka Y. Toda K. Kayano K. Oz M.C. Pinsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), complement activation (4.Naka Y. Marsh H.C. Scesney S.M. Oz M.C. Pinsky D.J. Transplantation. 1997; 64: 1248-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), abnormalities in pulmonary vascular tone, and increased procoagulant activity, resulting in microcirculatory failure, cellular dysfunction, edema, and cell death. The local production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α and tumor necrosis factor-α, is considerably increased in I/R injury (5.Chang D.M. Hsu K. Ding Y.A. Chiang C.H. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Although clear roles for proinflammatory cytokines and leukocyte adhesion receptors have been defined in the setting of frank pulmonary I/R (1.Naka Y. Toda K. Kayano K. Oz M.C. Pinsky D.J. Proc.

Physiol. 1990; 259: L315-L319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the pathophysiological role for localized thrombosis has been ascribed only by inference. Since microvascular thrombosis can impede the return of blood flow even when perfusion pressure is normalized, this can exacerbate and create ongoing tissue damage. In the brain, postischemic microvascular thrombosis and leukocyte recruitment contribute significantly to ischemic cerebral tissue damage (13.Choudhri T.F. Hoh B.L. Zerwes H.-G. Prestigiacomo C.J.

In the heart, postischemic no reflow has been documented even following relief of the major vascular obstruction. Although the lungs are a particularly vulnerable tissue in terms of their response to I/R injury, and even relatively minor interruptions of blood flow might lead to postischemic hypoperfusion and microvascular dysfunction (16.Gilroy Jr., R.J. Bhatte M.J. Wickersham N.E. Pou N.A. Loyd J.E. Overholser K.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the contribution of in situ thrombosis to the postischemic no-reflow phenomenon in the lungs remains unclear. The important role of fibrinolysis by the plasminogen activator system has been well studied in the case of large macrovascular thrombotic occlusions, and exogenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) has been widely used in clinical settings such as acute myocardial infarction or deep vein thrombosis. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a 52-kDa serine protease inhibitor that serves as the major plasma inhibitor of tPA and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and therefore has been the focus for study as the critical inhibitor of fibrinolysis (17.Fujii S. Sawa H. Saffitz J.E. Lucore C.L. Sobel B.E. Circulation. 1992; 86: 2000-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Sobel B.E. Woodcock-Mitchell J. Schneider D.J. Holt R.E. Marutsuka K. Gold H.

Some studies have suggested a relation between the increased synthesis of PAI-1 and persistence or recurrence of thrombosis (17.Fujii S. Sawa H. Saffitz J.E. Lucore C.L. Sobel B.E. Circulation. 1992; 86: 2000-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Sobel B.E. Woodcock-Mitchell J. Schneider D.J. Holt R.E. Marutsuka K. Gold H. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) even after thrombolytic therapy. We have shown the physiologic relevance of hypoxia-induced modulation of the fibrinolytic response in the pathogenesis of fibrin accumulation in lungs using PAI-1-, tPA-, and uPA-deficient mice (23.Pinsky D.J. Liao H. Lawson C.A. Yan S.F. Chen J. Carmeliet P. Loskutoff D.J. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Since hypoxia is an important component of the ischemic vascular milieu, these data suggest that I/R injury might involve not only induction of the inflammatory response but also abnormalities in the fibrinolytic system that lead to clot formation. In most biological systems, when one set of pathways is triggered, countervailing forces are activated to modulate the effects of uncontrolled activation of the primary pathway. The current studies were undertaken to elucidate the potential negative regulatory effects of IL-10 on critically relevant issues of cytokine induction and thrombosis in lung I/R injury. IL-10 is one of the Th2 type cytokines that is believed to exert anti-inflammatory effects in different systems by its ability to suppress macrophage activation and down-regulate proinflammatory cytokine production (24.Abbas A.K. Murphy K.M. Sher A. Nature. 1996; 383: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (3883) Google Scholar). IL-10 inhibits several macrophage functions, including antigen presentation to T cells, synthesis of several proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1α and -β, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), and production of reactive oxygen intermediates and nitric oxide (25.Fiorentino D.F. Bond M.W. Mosmann T.R. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 26.de Waal Malefyt R. Abrams J. Bennett B. Figdor C.G. de Vries J.E. J. Exp.

Commun. 1992; 182: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). With regard to the lung, several studies have shown that IL-10 reduces the intensity of cellular recruitment in pulmonary inflammation and is an inhibitor of the induced release of several proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and macrophage inflammatory proteins 1 and 2, supporting an anti-inflammatory role of IL-10 in the lung (28.Greenberger M.J. Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Danforth J.M. Goodman R.E. Standiford T.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 722-729PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, some studies have shown that IL-10 has significant protective effects in lung inflammatory injury by suppressing the expression ICAM-1 (29.Shanley T.P. Schmal H. Friedl H.P. Jones M.L. Ward P.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3454-3460PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Mulligan M.S. Jones M.L. Vaporciyan A.A. Howard M.C. Ward P.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5666-5674PubMed Google Scholar). Although a recent report shows that IL-10 may inhibit coagulation and potentiate the fibrinolytic system in human endotoxemia (31.Pajkrt D. van der Poll T. Levi M. Cutler D.L. Affrime M.B. van den Ende A. ten Cate J.W. van Deventer S.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 2701-2705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no data are available with respect to its effects on the coagulant/fibrinolytic mechanism in I/R. Therefore, the current studies were driven by a 2-fold hypothesis: 1) that microvascular thrombosis represents a significant component of lung I/R injury and 2) that endogenous IL-10 plays a pivotal role in regulating the fibrinolytic system in lung I/R injury. IL-10-deficient mice (IL-10 (−/−), C57/6-IL-10tm1cgn, male, 10 weeks old) (32.Kuhn R. Lohler J. Rennick D. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Cell. 1993; 75: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar) and their wild-type controls (IL-10 (+/+), C57/6J, male, 10 weeks old), which were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), were used in these experiments according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University, in accordance with guidelines of the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Animals were initially anesthetized intraperitoneally with 0.1 mg/g of mouse weight of ketamine and 0.01 mg/g of mouse weight of xylazine, followed by intraperitoneal continuous infusion of one-third of the initial dose per hour using a syringe pump (model 100 series, KD Scientific Inc.). After ensuring appropriate depth of anesthesia, mice were intubated via tracheostomy and placed on a Harvard ventilator (tidal volume = 0.75 ml, respiratory rate = 120/min) with room air, followed by bilateral thoracotomy. The left hilum was cross-clamped for a period of 1 h, after which the cross-clamp was released. Reperfusion proceeded from 1 to 3 h according to the following groups: untreated lung in sham operation; group I, 1-h ischemia without reperfusion; and R-1, R-2, or R-3 groups, consisting of 1-h ischemia followed by 1-, 2-, and 3-h reperfusion, respectively. After observation, blood samples were obtained for ELISA (IL-10), and lung specimens were taken for Northern blot analysis. For all experiments, the surgical operator was blinded by a colleague in the laboratory as to either the strain of mice being used (all mice were black in appearance) or to the specific substance being injected. Four groups were studied: 1) IL-10 (+/+) mice (received 300 μl of PBS without additive); 2) IL-10 (−/−) mice (received 300 μl of PBS without additive); 3) IL-10 (−/−) mice given 1 μg of recombinant murine IL-10 (R & D Systems) after thoracotomy but before pulmonary ischemia. rmIL-10 was prepared as 1 μg/300 μl in PBS; 4) IL-10 (−/−) mice given 1.0 mg/kg recombinant hirudin (direct and specific thrombin inhibitor; Sigma) after thoracotomy but before pulmonary ischemia. Recombinant hirudin was prepared for a 1.0 mg/kg injection in 300 μl in PBS. For all four groups, the experimental procedures were as follows. After 1-h ischemia followed by 2-h reperfusion, the contralateral (right) hilum was permanently ligated, so that the animal's survival and gas exchange depended solely upon the reperfused lung, and observation continued for 1 h among these four groups. As the mouse continued to be ventilated, death of the mouse was defined as a combination of 1) cessation of regular cardiac activity; 2) the apparent collapse of the left atrium; and 3) brief clonic activity indicating cessation of cerebral blood flow. At the time of death, blood samples were obtained for ELISA (IL-1α, sICAM-1) or PAI/tPA activity assays, and lung specimens were taken for the measurement of wet/dry ratios or Northern blot analyses . In a separate series of survival experiments, lung function was ascertained by arterial blood gas analysis (sampled from the left ventricle) in mice that survived for 30 min after right hilar ligation. Immediately after determination of lung function, mice were heparinized, and lung specimens were taken for Western blot or immunohistochemical analysis for fibrin. These experiments were performed as a separate group so that obtaining the left ventricular sample of blood did not impact on mouse survival. When mice were sacrificed after the survival experiments, the left hilum was ligated, and then the left lung (including residual blood) was taken and weighed as a wet weight. The lung specimen was desiccated at 80 °C for 24 h and weighed again as dry weight. Wet weight was divided by dry weight for the calculation of wet/dry ratio. IL-10 (+/+) mice were divided into untreated, I, R-1, R-2, and R-3 groups. In each group, blood was drawn from the heart, kept at 4 °C overnight, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min to obtain serum, which was then divided into aliquots and frozen at −80 °C until the time of use. The serum IL-10 level was assayed by ELISA kits (R & D Systems), and IL-1α and sICAM-1 levels were assayed by an ELISA kit (Endogen). The lower limits of detection for IL-10, IL-1 α, and sICAM-1 assays are 4 pg/ml, 6 pg/ml, and 5 ng/ml, respectively. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations. In dedicated experiments, the left lung was rapidly excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until the time of mRNA extraction. After tissue homogenization using a Brinkmann Polytron homogenizer, total RNA from the lung tissues was isolated by the Tryzol method (Life Technologies, Inc.), and then poly(A) mRNA were purified using Poly(A)Ttract® mRNA Isolation Systems (Promega, Madison, WI). To detect IL-1α, IL-10, PAI-1, and tPA transcripts, equal amounts of poly(A) mRNA (2.5 μg/lane) or total RNA (25 μg/lane) were loaded onto an 0.8% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde for size fractionation and then transferred overnight to nylon membranes (Duralon-UVTM membranes; Strategene) with 20× SSC buffer. A murine IL-10 (1.5 kilobases; American Type Culture Collection), IL-1α (789 bp), PAI-1 (900 bp; the plasmid, containing a pBS vector and a 3014-bp insert, was generously provided by M. Cole), and tPA (800 bp; composed of a 2.5-kb insert from a pKS +/− plasmid vector (33.Rickles R.J. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1563-1569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) cDNAs were purified using a Qiagen II gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.). These fragments were used as cDNA probes after32P-random primer labeling (Prime-It RmT; Strategene) with [α-32P]dCTP. After prehybridization and hybridization using QuikHyb hybridization solution (Strategene) at 68 °C for 1 h, the blots were washed twice for 15 min with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by one wash for 30 min with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Blots were developed with X-Omat AR film exposed with an intensifying light screen at −80 °C for 3 days. Normalized absorption values were obtained by densitometry scanning (Molecular Imager® System; Bio-Rad) of cDNAs including β-actin bands. In order to make RNA probes forin situ hybridization, the polymerase chain reaction was first performed using total RNA from the lung tissue after 1-h ischemia followed by 2-h reperfusion. Reverse transcription was performed on total RNA with oligo(dT) primers, and amplification was carried out for 35 cycles by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers for IL-10 (CLONTECH): 5′ primer, 5′-ATGCAGGACTTTAAGGGTTACTTGGGTT-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-ATTTCGGAGAGAGGTACAAACGAGGTTT-3′. An aliquot of the polymerase chain reaction product mixture was run in a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The polymerase chain reaction products (455 bp) were recovered using a Qiagen II gel extraction kit (QIAGEN) and inserted to pGEM-T® Easy Vector using the T4 ligation method (Promega). The RNA expression plasmid was linearized withNcoI and SalI enzymes to allow in vitro run-off synthesis of both sense- and antisense-oriented RNA probes. Both sense and antisense probes were labeled by transcription with a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the labeled probes were then purified. Both untreated lungs and left lungs after 1-h ischemia/2-h reperfusion were snap-frozen embedded in OCT compound (Miles Scientific) in a cryomold in liquid nitrogen. The frozen sections were cut at 5 μm thick and placed on glass slides precoated with opaque (VWR Scientific Products). Briefly, slides were prefixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then digested with 14 μg/ml proteinase K in Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) for 15 min at 37 °C, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Sections were acetylated with 0.1 mol/liter triethanolamine (pH 8.0) with 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride. Sections were then equilibrated for 60 min in hybridization buffer consisting of 4× SSC, 50% formamide, 5% dextran sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 0.05 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 45 °C with either IL-10 sense or antisense probe (1:25 dilution in prehybridization buffer). Sections were subjected to stringent washes consisting of a single wash with 2× SSC, two 30-min washes with 1 × SSC at room temperature, two 30-min washes with 0.1× SSC at 37 °, and two 20-min washes with Tris buffer (100 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/liter NaCl). After blocking with blocking buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 4% sheep serum, 100 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, and 150 mmol/liter NaCl), sections were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at room temperature. After four washes, color was allowed to develop for 4 h, and development was stopped by dipping the slides briefly in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and then rinsing. Sections were covered with coverslips with water-soluble mounting medium. PAI/tPA activity was determined by a functional rate assay described by Ranby et al. (34.Ranby M. Norrman B. Wallen P. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 743-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and its adaptation to plasma samples, as described by Wiman et al. (35.Wiman B. Mellbring G. Ranby M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 127: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Blood samples (F, n = 9; IL-10 (+/+),n = 9; IL-10 (−/−), n = 9; and IL-10 (−/−) plus rmIL-10, n = 9) were drawn at the end of survival experiments and acidified by acetate buffer immediately. The samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. Equal volumes of acetate buffer and Tris buffer were added to acidified plasma and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The activity was assayed by Spectrolyse® tPA/PAI activity assay kits (American Diagnostica). In brief, each sample was added to reaction mixture containing a known quantity of tPA, soluble fibrin (Desafib; American Diagnostica), and a plasmin substrate (Spectrozyme PL; American Diagnostica). Plasmin generated by the reaction of tPA and fibrin cleaves the Spectrozyme substrate to generate a yellow color, which can be measured at an OD of 405 nm. PAI activity is expressed as the amount of PAI that inhibits 1 IU of tPA. Lung tissues were harvested following systemic heparinization and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until the time of fibrin extraction. These tissues were placed in buffer (0.05 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 500 units/ml heparin, final pH 7.6) on ice and homogenized. Plasmin digestion was performed by a modification of the methods of Francis (36.Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Martin S.E. Blood. 1980; 56: 456-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (34.Ranby M. Norrman B. Wallen P. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 743-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Human plasmin (0.32 units/ml; Sigma) was added to the tissue homogenate, followed by agitation at 37 °C for 6 h. More plasmin (0.32 units/ml) was then added, and samples were agitated for an additional 2 h, and then the mixture was centrifuged at 2300 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. As a positive control, mouse fibrinogen (2.5 mg in 0.25 ml; Sigma) was clotted with human thrombin (4 units; Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline (1.75 ml) in the presence of calcium chloride (0.013 ml of 2.5 m) for 4 h at room temperature. Clotted fibrinogen was centrifuged for 5 min, and the pellet was suspended in Tris-buffered saline (1.0 ml) containing human plasmin (0.32 units/ml) and agitated at 37 °C. Additional plasmin (0.32 unit/ml) was added after 6 h, and samples were agitated for an additional 2 h. As a negative control, unclotted mouse fibrinogen was processed in an identical manner. Protein concentration of plasmin-treated lung supernatants and plasmin-treated unclotted and clotted fibrinogen solutions was measured by the Bradford method (37.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar) before loading the gel. Samples were boiled for 3 min under reducing conditions, loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5% reduced gel; 10 μg of protein/lane), and subjected to electrophoresis. Samples were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots were reacted with a monoclonal anti-fibrin IgG1 (Biodesign International) that had been prepared with human fibrin-like β peptide as immunogen (38.Hui K.Y. Haber E. Matsueda G.R. Science. 1983; 222: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The cross-reactivity of this antibody with murine fibrin was confirmed by blotting with the positive (murine fibrin) and negative (murine fibrinogen) controls prepared as described above. Secondary detection of sites of primary antibody localization was accomplished using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc) (Sigma). Final detection of bands was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In addition to Western blot analyses performed as described above, fibrin accumulation was determined by immunohistochemistry. Left lung tissue from untreated and IL-10 (−/−) groups, harvested in survival experiments (with antemortem heparinization to limit postmortem thrombosis) was used to identify the fibrin accumulation by immunostaining. The left lung was snap-frozen embedded in OCT compound, and sections were cut at 5 μm thick, air-dried, and acetone-fixed. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation for 20 min in PBS containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were immunostained using the same primary antibody (1:50) as that used for Western blotting, which is reactive to murine fibrin. Sites of primary antibody binding were visualized with mouse ExtraAvidin® alkaline phosphatase staining kit (Sigma) and Sigma FAST 228 FAST RED (Sigma). In order to more specifically localize fibrin deposits, a double immunostaining technique was employed on these same sections. Sections were overlaid with 20% goat serum for 30 min, washed, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a rabbit polyclonal antihuman von Willebrand's antibody (Cortex Biochem, San Leandro CA). Detection of the primary antibody was accomplished using a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG and the peroxidase avidin-biotin staining procedure. Immunostaining for mononuclear phagocytes was accomplished using a primary rat monoclonal anti-mouse panmacrophage marker (MOMA-2; BIOSOURCEInternational, Camarillo, CA) (39.Lloyd C.M. Minto A.W.

Development and visualization were accomplished as described above with the exception that slides were counterstained with methyl green. The number of positively stained macrophages was determined in 10 random high power fields (× 400 magnification), and the average number of macrophages/field was calculated for each group. The data were expressed as mean ± S.E. All statistical comparisons were performed using a commercially available statistical package for the Macintosh personal computer (STAT VIEW-J 5.0; Abacus Concepts). Analysis of variance was used to compare different conditions among the groups of mice. The product limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimate of the cumulative survival was assessed with the log-rank test to evaluate significa"

We showed that G-CSF rapidly and transiently induces expression of egr-1 in the NFS60 myeloid cell line. Transient transfections of NFS60 cells with recombinant constructs containing various deletions of the humanegr-1 promoter identified the serum response element (SRE) between nucleotides (nt) –418 and –391 as a critical G-CSF-responsive sequence. The SRE (SRE-1) contains a CArG box, the binding site for the serum response factor (SRF), which is flanked at either side by an ETS protein binding site. We demonstrated that a single copy of the wild-type SRE-1 in the minimal promoter plasmid, pTE2, is sufficient to induce transcriptional activation in response to G-CSF and that both the ETS protein binding site and the CArG box are required for maximal transcriptional activation of the pTE2-SRE-1 construct. In electromobility shift assays using NFS60 nuclear extracts, we identified SRF and the ETS protein Fli-1 as proteins that bind the SRE-1. We also demonstrated through electrophoretic mobility shift assays, using an SRE-1 probe containing a CArG mutation, that Fli-1 binds the SRE-1 independently of SRF.

Treatment of myeloid cells with G-CSF results in rapid and transient expression of egr-1 independently of protein synthesis. G-CSF induces egr-1 expression and granulocyte differentiation in 32Dcl3 cells (20.Kreider B.L. Rovera G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar) and also stimulates proliferation and egr-1 expression in human UT-7 epo cells overexpressing the wild-type G-CSF receptor (21.Tian S.-S. Tapley P. Sincich C. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Lamb P. Blood. 1996; 88: 4435-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of egr-1, like that of other immediate early genes, is governed by preexisting regulatory proteins that are posttranslationally modified and thus activated upon receptor stimulation. The precise signaling events that mediate expression ofegr-1 in response to G-CSF in proliferative responses have not been elucidated. Identification of this pathway may provide insights into possible mechanisms that lead to the development of leukemogenesis. It has been suggested that G-CSF selectively activates distinct early growth response genes through different Janus kinase-STAT proteins. For example, G-CSF stimulation of the early genes OSM, IRF-1, and egr-1 is dependent on STAT5 activation, whereas activation of c-fos is STAT5-independent (21.Tian S.-S. Tapley P. Sincich C. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Lamb P. Blood. 1996; 88: 4435-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although STAT5 protein expression is induced in response to G-CSF, that STAT5 DNA recognition element has not been identified in the murineegr-1 promoter (21.Tian S.-S. Tapley P. Sincich C. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Lamb P. Blood. 1996; 88: 4435-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling pathways that control egr-1 expression and myeloid cell proliferation have been examined for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-3 (22.Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.-J.J. Lehman E. Gasson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The receptors for GM-CSF and IL-3, like G-CSF receptor, are also members of the cytokine receptor superfamily and regulate early myeloid development. GM-CSF- and IL-3-induced signals converge upon the cAMP response element in theegr-1 promoter in the factor-dependent human myeloid leukemic TF-1 cell line (22.Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.-J.J. Lehman E. Gasson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). egr-1 promoter sequences mediating G-CSF-induced egr-1 expression and myeloid proliferation, including the egr-1 promoter sites responsive to G-CSF, appear to be distinct from those involved in GM-CSF and IL-3 signaling, due to the different proteins activated by these proteins. The goal of our study was to define G-CSF-responsive sequences of theegr-1 promoter and to identify interacting proteins in NFS60 cells. We show that egr-1 is rapidly and transiently expressed in NFS60 cells stimulated with G-CSF and that this activation occurs independently of protein synthesis. Transient transfections with recombinant egr-1 promoter constructs in NFS60 cells demonstrated that the CArG box and the ETS protein binding site (EBS) are required for maximal transcriptional activation of egr-1in response to G-CSF. Electromobility gel shift assays (EMSAs) showed that SRF and Fli-1 bind the CArG and EBS between nucleotides (nt) –418 and –391 in the egr-1 promoter, respectively. Our experiments suggest that serum response element (SRE)-binding proteins may associate as a quaternary complex to maximally activateegr-1 transcription. Thus, signaling pathways activated by G-CSF may be distinct from those activated by GM-CSF or IL-3, suggesting a potential mechanism for specificity between growth factors that regulate myelopoiesis. The murine myeloid leukemic factor-dependent NFS60 cell line was cultured in 1× RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (1 mg/ml) at a ratio of 1 unit/ml to 1 mg/ml,l-glutamine (2 mm), and gentamicin (10 mg/ml). Cells were maintained on IL-3 WEHI-3 conditioned media (1:100) in tissue culture flasks at 37 °C. Cells were serum- and factor-starved for 18 h and then stimulated with G-CSF for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Cells were also stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (50 ng/ml) for 60 min (positive control) or diluent (0.02% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline). To demonstrate protein expression in the absence of protein synthesis, cells were stimulated with G-CSF (10 nm) or tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (50 ng/ml) in combination with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 30 min. The cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted by the Nonidet P-40 method (23.Kumar A. Lindberg U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of extracted RNA from each sample was separated on a 1% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with a [32P]dCTP-labeled 1.3EcoRI fragment of murine egr-1/tis8 or with a [32P]dCTP-labeled 500-base pair actin fragment as control. A –600 nt HinfI fragment of the egr-1 promoter (nt –606 to –7 of the putative transcription start site) was gel-purified from the full-length human egr-1 genomic clone (24.Sakamoto K. Bardeleben C. Yates K. Raines M. Golde D. Gasson J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 867-871PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmids containing the full-length or various deletions of the –600 egr-1fragment (–480, –235, –180, –116, and –56 nt) has been described (25.Sakamoto K. Nimer S. Rosenblatt J. Gasson J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2125-2130PubMed Google Scholar). A –418 and –387 nt egr-1 fragment was amplified from the p-480 CAT plasmid by polymerase chain reaction. A reverse primer flanking the egr-1 promoter at –10 nt, containing aXbaI site (5′-GC[TCTAGA]GCCGGATCCGCCTCTATTTGAAGG-3′), was used in combination with a forward polymerase chain reaction primer flanking the egr-1 promoter at –418 nt, containing aHindIII site (5′-ACC[AAGCTT]C(CCGGAAT)G(CCATATAAGG)A(CAGGAAG)-3′). A reverse primer flanking the egr-1 promoter at –7 nt, containing aXbaI site (5′-GC[TCTAGA]GCCCCGGAT-3′), was used with a forward polymerase chain reaction primer flanking the egr-1promoter at –387 nt, containing a PstI site (5′-GAGT[CTGC AG]CTGGAACAAC CCTTA-3′). The polymerase chain reaction-amplifiedegr-1 fragments were digested with XbaI andHindIII or PstI and then gel-purified and directionally subcloned into the pCAT vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The SRE from nt –418 to –391 of the human egr-1 promoter (SRE-1) was synthesized as a single element, with HindIII and XbaI sites created at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (5′-AGCTTCGGA(CCGGAAT)G(CCATATAAGG)A(GCAGGAAG)GATCCT-3′). In addition, mutated SRE-1 were synthesized with the 5′ and 3′HindIII and XbaI ends, including CArGm(5′-AGCTTCGGA(CCGGAAT)G(CCA g AT ct GG)A(GCAGGAAG)GATCCT-3′), LmR (5′-AGCTTCGGA(CC tt AAT)G(CCATATAAGG)A(GCAGGAAG)GATCCT-3′), LRm(5′-AGCTTCGGA(CCGGAAT)G(CCATATAAGG)A(GCA tt AAG)GATCCT-3′), and LmRm(5′-AGCTTCGGA(CC tt AAT)G(CCATATAAGG)A(GCA tt AAG)GATCCT-3′). The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into theHindIII and XbaI sites in the pTE2 vector. Transient co-transfections of constructs into NFS60 cells were performed by electroporation (Bio-Rad) at 250 V, 960 F. Cells were serum- and growth factor-starved for 18 h in RPMI-0.5% BSA. Twenty million cells were transfected with 20 μg of the specified egr-1promoter/CAT construct or 20 μg of the specified minimal promoter pTE2/CAT construct and 5 μg of the pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (pCMV-βgal) (internal control). Transfected cells were resuspended in RPMI-0.5% BSA and stimulated with G-CSF (10 nm) or diluent control (0.02% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline) for 3 h. The cells were harvested; half the lysates were assayed for CAT activity and the other half for βgal activity. The CAT assay was used to measure egr-1 promoter activity and was performed as described previously (22.Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.-J.J. Lehman E. Gasson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The amount of acetylated and unacetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was determined by thin-layer chromatography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The βgal assay (Promega) was used as internal control for transfection efficiency. Corrected fold stimulation was determined by dividing the percentage of acetylation of the G-CSF-stimulated cells by unstimulated (diluent) cells. Statistical analysis was performed using the JMP In program (SAS Institute Inc.). The probes used for EMSA experiments included theegr-1 SRE-1 sequence (forward,5′-AGCTTGCGAC[CCGGAAAT]G[CCATATAAGG]A[GCAGGAAG]GATCCCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTAGAGGGGATC[CTTCCTGC]T[CCTTATATGG]C[ATTTCCGG]GTCGCA-3′), the left EBS sequence (forward, 5′-AC[CCGGAAAT]GC-3′; reverse, 5′-GC[ATTTCCGG]GT), the right EBS sequences (forward, 5′-AGCTTGA[GCAGGAAG]GAT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTAGATC[CTTCCTGC]TCA-3′), control CArG consensus element (forward, 5′-GGATGT[CCATATTAGG]ACATCT-3′; reverse, 5′-AGATGT[CCTAATATGG]ACATCC), or mutant SRE-1 sequences, including CArGm (forward, 5′-AGCTTGCGAC[CCGGAAAT]G[CCA g AT ct GG] A[GCAGGAAG]GATCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTAGAGGGGATC[CTTCCTGC]T [CC ag AT c TGG]C[ATTTCCGG]GTCGCA-3′), LmR (forward, 5′-AGCTTGCGAC[CC tt AAAT]G[CCATATAAGG]A[GCAGGAAG]GATCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTAGAGGGGATC[CTTCCTGC]T[CCTTATATGG]C[ATTT aa GG]GTCGCA-3′), and LRm (forward, 5′-AGCTTGCGAC[CCGGAAAT]G[CCATATAAGG] A[GCA tt AAG]GATCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTAGAGGGGATC[CTT aa TGC]T [CCTTATATGG]C[ATTTCCGG]GTCGCA-3′), and LmRm(forward, 5′-AGCTTGCGAC[CC tt AAAT]G[CCATATAAGG]A[GCA tt AAG]GATCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTAGAGGGGATC[CTT aa TGC]T[CCTTATATGG]C[ATTT aa GG] GTCGCA-3′). Complimentary single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled using [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled probe was purified with Nuctrap Push Columns (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared by the modified Dignam method (26.Fraser J. Guerra J. Nguyen C. Indes J. Gasson J. Nimer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) from unstimulated (diluent) or G-CSF-stimulated NFS60 cells for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay with Pierce protein assay reagents. Nuclear extracts (15–20 μg) were incubated with 0.1 μg of labeled probe in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC):(dI-dC) and 5 μg of BSA in 20 μl of gel shift buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 25% (v/v) glycerol) for 30 min on ice. Competitor oligonucleotides or antibodies were preincubated with the nuclear extracts for 30 min on ice prior to the addition of probe. Competitor oligonucleotides, including the nonspecific sequence, 69ΔALL, or wild-type or three mutant forms of the SRE-1 sequence, were added in 100- or 200-fold molar excess. Fli-1 antibody (2, 4, or 8 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used in supershift assays. Polyclonal rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as the control antiserum (1.1 ng/μl). After incubation periods, the samples were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel and run at 100 V in 0.4× TBE. Gels were dried and exposed to film at −70 °C. We demonstrate that NFS60 cells are a growth factor-dependent myeloid cell line (data not shown). Furthermore, NFS60 cells proliferate in response to G-CSF in a dose-dependent manner (27.Metcalf D. Leukemia. 1989; 3: 349-355PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Gascan H. Moreau J. Jacques Y. Soulillou J. Lymphokine Res. 1989; 8: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, NFS60 cells provide a good model in which to examine G-CSF-induced proliferative signals. Rapid and transient expression of egr-1 has been previously shown to occur in response to GM-CSF in myeloid leukemic TF-1 cells (22.Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.-J.J. Lehman E. Gasson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To demonstrate egr-1 expression in NFS60 cells in response to G-CSF, Northern blot analysis was performed. Northern blot analysis with RNA from NFS60 cells stimulated with G-CSF for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min demonstrated a rapid and transient induction of egr-1 (Fig. 1). Expression of egr-1 was not induced in diluent-treated cells (0 min). Accumulation of egr-1 RNA was observed within 30 min and was no longer observed at 60 min following G-CSF treatment. Stimulation of cells for 60 min with G-CSF or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide resulted in induction ofegr-1. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate has been previously shown to induce egr-1 expression within 60 min of cell treatment (8.Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Kujubu D.A. Luner S.J. Kaufman S.E. Greenberger J.S. Gasson J.C. Herschman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3580-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed in two independent experiments. Our results demonstrate that egr-1expression occurs rapidly and transiently in cells stimulated with G-CSF and that induction of egr-1 occurs independently of protein synthesis. To identify the egr-1promoter sequences that are responsive to G-CSF signaling, NFS60 cells were transiently transfected with egr-1 promoter constructs. Serum- and growth factor-starved NFS60 cells were transfected with constructs containing –600, –480, –387, –235, –180, –116, or –56 nt of the human egr-1 promoter (Fig.2) and pCMV-βgal for measurement of transfection efficiency. We previously showed that the –56 nt region of egr-1contains minimal activity that is equal to the pCAT empty vector (22.Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.-J.J. Lehman E. Gasson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have therefore used p-56 CAT as the vector control in our experiments. In response to G-CSF, the –600 and –480 ntegr-1 constructs demonstrated maximal stimulation (Fig. 2) at 9.0-fold activity relative to p-56 CAT control vector. Deletion of nucleotides between –480 and –387 resulted in a 6-fold decrease in transcriptional activation (p = 0.0024; Fig. 2), and further deletion to nt –116 did not reduce this activity. In diluent-treated cells, the constructs had basal activities that were not statistically significantly different from that of the control vector (data not shown). All transfections were performed in duplicate or triplicate, representing an average of three to seven experiments. These results indicate that the region between –480 and –387 nt of the egr-1 promoter contains critical sequences required for maximal transcriptional activation of egr-1. The region between nt –480 and –387 contains a single SRE, with a central CArG box flanked by EBSs, which we have called SRE-1 (Fig.3 A). Transfections with a construct containing –418 nt of the egr-1 promoter (Fig.3 A) showed similar activity levels with the p-480 nt construct (data not shown). These results suggested that the SRE, between nt –418 and –391 (SRE-1), may contain a critical transcription factor binding site regulating G-CSF-induced transcription of egr-1. Previous studies have identified SRF binding to the CArG box of SREs in the promoters of immediate early genes (29.Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 30.Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R.

To determine whether endogenous SRE-binding proteins in nuclear extracts from NFS60 cells interact with the wild-type SRE-1 sequence between nt –418 and –391 of the egr-1 promoter (Fig. 3 A), EMSAs were performed. Nuclear extracts prepared from diluent- or G-CSF-treated NFS60 cells were incubated with the SRE-1 oligonucleotide probe with an excess of unlabeled specific or nonspecific competitor and then analyzed on the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The diluent- and G-CSF-treated nuclear extracts produced four and five gel shift bands or complexes, designated D1–D4 and G1–G5, respectively (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 3). Band specificity was demonstrated by competition of the bands with a 200m excess of specific unlabeled probe sequence (Fig.3 B, lanes 2 and 4) and by the lack of competition with an excess of unlabeled nonspecific sequence (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 3). The two slowest migrating bands in the diluent-treated extracts, D1 and D2 (Fig. 3 B, lane 1), were only evident when an increased amount of protein was used, and band D1 migrated differently from band G1 in the G-CSF-stimulated extracts (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and3). These results suggest that bands/complexes 1–5 represent proteins that specifically bind the SRE-1 sequence and that potentially different or biochemically modified (i.e.phosphorylated) SRE-binding proteins bind to SRE-1 in G-CSF-treated compared with diluent-treated extracts. To determine whether SRF binds the SRE-1 in theegr-1 promoter, we performed EMSA supershift experiments with the SRF antibody. Addition of SRF antibody resulted in a supershift of bands 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4–6), whereas addition of IgG control did not produce any change in the gel shift pattern (Fig. 3 C, lane 7). The control probe containing the CArG sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) resulted in a supershifted band that co-migrates with the supershifted band seen with the SRE-1 probe (Fig. 3 C, lane 11). Furthermore, an excess of unlabeled CArG oligonucleotide alone specifically competed bands 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 C, lane 3), suggesting that these bands are SRF-containing complexes. Addition of the SRF antibody in EMSAs using diluent-treated extracts also resulted in a supershifted band pattern (data not shown). These results were confirmed in two separate experiments. SRF binding to the SRE has been shown to be enhanced upon SRF phosphorylation (33.Janknecht R. Hipskind R. Houthaeve T. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 34.Misra R. Rivera V. Wang J. Fan P. Greenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), yet it has also been shown to bind the SRE constitutively (35.Herrera R. Shaw P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1989; 340: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 36.Sheng M. Dougan S. McFadden G. Greenberg M. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that SRF binds the SRE-1, and the supershift band corresponds with the band observed with SRF binding to the CArG probe. Thus, these results indicate that SRF binds the CArG sequence of SRE-1 in G-CSF-treated nuclear extracts. A previous report has demonstrated that Fli-1 is one of the ETS proteins that recognizes the EBS of SRE-1 in theegr-1 promoter (39.Watson D.K. Robinson L. Hodge D.R. Kola I. Papas T.S. Seth A. Oncogene. 1997; 14 (211): 213Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To identify ETS proteins in NFS60 nuclear extracts that bind the EBS of SRE-1, EMSA experiments were performed using antibodies to various ETS proteins. Addition of Fli-1 antibody to G-CSF-stimulated extracts resulted in the disappearance of band 1 and the formation of two supershifted bands, 1A and 1B (Fig.4, lanes 1–3). This suggests that band 1A represents a complex composed of both SRF and Fli-1 bound to the SRE-1 probe. Band 1B may represent a complex of SRF and Fli-1 with additional proteins. Addition of Fli-1 antibody in EMSAs using diluent-treated extracts resulted in a very weak supershift band pattern under certain conditions (data not shown). Addition of antibodies to other ETS proteins, including Elk-1, Sap1a/b, PU.1, Elf-1, ETS-1/2, ERG-1/2, and PEA3, did not produce a change in the gel shift pattern in either diluent- or G-CSF-treated extracts (data not shown). Our data suggest that in addition to SRF, Fli-1 also binds the SRE-1 in the egr-1 promoter in G-CSF-stimulated extracts. Ternary complexes composed of SRF and ETS protein family members have been shown to regulate the expression of many immediate early gene SREs (32.Latinkic B. Lau L. J. Biol.

To determine whether the SRE-1 sequence is sufficient to induce egr-1 transcriptional activation in response to G-CSF, NFS60 cells were transiently transfected with a construct containing a synthetic oligonucleotide representing a single human SRE-1 in the pTE2 vector that contains a heterologous TK promoter and the CAT gene. pTE2 constructs with mutations within the SRE-1 were also prepared (Fig.5 A). The mutant SRE-1 constructs included a 3-base substitution within the CArG core consensus binding sequence (CArGm/BglII) and a GG to TT substitution within the ETS consensus binding site (GGA) at the left (LmR), the right (LRm), or both the left and right (LmRm) EBSs of SRE-1. Upon G-CSF treatment, the pTE2 SRE-1 wild-type construct demonstrated a 3.5-fold induction compared with the empty vector (p < 0.001; Fig. 5 B). Upon G-CSF stimulation, the pTE2-CArGm/ BglII, -LmR, -LRm, and -LmRm constructs behaved similarly to vector control, but all demonstrated reduced induction levels as compared with pTE2 SRE-1 (p = 0.0132, 0.0381, 0.0022, and 0.0056, respectively; Fig. 5 B). In diluent-treated cells, the basal activity of the pTE2-CArGm/ BglII, -LmR, -LRm, and -LmRm constructs demonstrated percentage of acetylation values similar to the pTE2 empty vector, ranging from 1.5 to 0.82%, respectively (data not shown). These experiments were repeated 3–11 times and were performed in triplicate. The CArG box mutation (pTE2-CArGm/ BglII) also efficiently inhibited competition of the SRF/SRE gel shift band (gel shift band 2) in EMSA experiments (Fig. 5 C, lanes 2 and 3). Mutations within the EBS core consensus sequence at the 5′ (LmR), 3′ (LRm), or both 5′ and 3′ EBS (LmRm) were previously shown to inhibit ETS protein binding (39.Watson D.K. Robi"

Activation of RSK1 involved sequential phosphorylation of at least four sites, starting with phosphorylation through ERK of a threonine in the CTD activation loop and a serine in the linker, further phosphorylation of a linker serine through CTD, and phosphorylation of a serine in the NTD activation loop, leading to full kinase activity (50Dalby N.K.

Interestingly, in RSK2 activation PDK1 (and possibly other independent upstream kinases) rather than CTD phosphorylated the NTD activation loop serine, indicating that RSKs can integrate signals from ERK and independent upstream pathways (51Jensen C.J.

Intriguingly, both MSK1 and RSKB appeared to phosphorylate CREB, thus indicating a symmetric downstream effector of ERK and p38 pathways (42Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E.

Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Similar to other RSKs (60Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both MSK1 and RSKB located to the nucleus (61Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.L. Tomás-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

Here we report a study on the control of RSKB activation through NTD, CTD, and linker phosphorylation sites. RSKB in cells stimulated by TNF treatment was activated within 10 min, and its activation persisted for prolonged periods, in contrast to the burst and rapid return to basal activity levels of the upstream MAPKs, p38 and ERK, and of the parallel RSK1–3, indicating that RSKB selectively escaped from a more common down-regulatory control of MAPKs and other RSKs.DISCUSSIONThe RSK family of kinases, RSK1–3, MSK1, and RSKB, share a number of common properties. They are composed of two complete catalytic kinase domains, with intervening linker and C-terminal tail sequences containing regulatory elements; their activation progresses by stepwise phosphorylation from CTD to NTD, the latter being the effector of downstream substrate phosphorylations (50Dalby N.K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The present studies show that RSKB is activated by various cell treatment protocols that also have been reported to activate other RSKs (2Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar); TNF, ionomycin, PMA, and EGF elicited RSKB activation, whereas insulin had no effect. Despite these similarities, substantial evidence indicates a functional independence of the individual RSK family members. First, none of the RSKs complements deficient RSK2 in CLS (46Abidi F. Jacquot S. Lassiter C. Trivier E. Hanauer A. Schwartz C.E. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 7: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and possibly RSK4 in XLMR (48Yntema H.G. van den Helm B. Kissing J. van Duijnhoven G. Poppelaars F. Chelly J. Moraine C. Fryns J.P. Hamel B.C. Heilbronner H. Pander H.J. Brunner H.G. Ropers H.H. Cremers F.P. van Bokhoven H. Genomics. 1999; 62: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Second, while RSK1–3 are activated through ERK, RSKB, as shown by its responses to MAPKs, effects of SB202190 and PD98059, and direct activation in vitro, mainly depended on p38 and to a lesser extent ERK (61Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.L. Tomás-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29661-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 63Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Third, RSK1 retained partial activation potential when either NTD or CTD was inactivated (50Dalby N.K. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar); in contrast, inactivating mutations of either NTD or CTD fully abolished RSKB activity. Furthermore, RSK2 integrated ERK and PDK1 signals, and the isolated NTD of RSK2 remained permissive for PDK1 activation (51Jensen C.J. Buch M.B. Krag T.O. Hemmings B.A. Gammeltoft S. Frodin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); in contrast, at present there is no evidence for a similar signal integrative function of RSKB. The activation of RSKB by p38 in vitro shows that p38 alone, possibly combined with autophosphorylation, suffices to convert RSKB to the fully activated state. This supports the view that while ERK may substitute for p38 in activating RSKB, this presents a convergence point rather than a site that can integrate independent signals from two pathways.Much has been learned about the role of RSK1–3 in growth factor stimulation, cell cycle, and survival control (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar and 43Nebreda A.R. Gavin A.C. Science. 1999; 286: 1309-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Less is known at present about the role of the more recently discovered MSK1 and RSKB (61Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1026-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). MSK1, through phosphorylation of histone H3 and HMG-14 protein, was reported to be a kinase functioning in chromatin remodeling associated with immediate early gene induction (65Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). RSKB and MSK1 as all RSKs, in parallel to Ca2+/calmodulin- and cAMP-dependent signaling, activate CREB (reviewed in Ref. 80Impey S. Obrietan K. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1999; 23: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar); it will be an intriguing task to unravel the selective effects of CREB activation through the various pathways. In such studies, it will be important to remember that an inhibitor such as H89, previously thought to selectively block cAMP-dependent protein kinase (72Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M.

One of the two chlorophylls band up to five of the six chlorophylls a present in Lhcb4 are shown to adopt similar binding conformations to the (presumably) corresponding molecules in LHCIIb, whereas at least two chlorophylls in the former protein assume unique conformations relative to the bulk complex. The overall conformation of bound xanthophyll molecules is identical in the two antenna proteins, although some small differences are apparent.

The pigment binding properties of these two LHCs are discussed, with particular reference to possible structural motifs within this extended family of proteins. light-harvesting complex chlorophyll The light-harvesting proteins of higher plants form part of the extended LHC1 gene family, which also includes similar proteins in algae as well as other more distantly related members of unknown function. These antenna complexes are responsible for the absorption of visible light and its transfer, in the form of singlet excitons, to reaction center proteins, where primary charge separation takes place. This series of events constitutes the light reactions of photosynthesis, being the first step in the production of chemical energy and reducing equivalents required by the plant for survival. The antenna of photosystem II in green plants is made up of a number of LHCs: the major (trimeric) protein LHCIIb, plus at least three other monomeric proteins named CP29, CP26, and CP24 (1.Bassi R. Rigoni F. Giacommeti G.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 52: 1187-1206Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) or, alternatively, LHCIIa, LHCIIc, and LHCIId (2.Thornber J.P. Peter G.F. Chitnis P.R. Nechustai R. Vainstein A. Stevens Jr., S.E. Bryant D.A. Light-Energy Transduction in Photosynthesis: Higher Plant and Bacterial Models. American Society of Plant Physiology, New York1988: 137-154Google Scholar). Note that a more recent nomenclature for the LHC genes (3.Jansson S. Pichersky E. Bassi R. Green B.R. Ikeuchi M. Melis A. Simpson D.J. Spangfort M. Staehelin L.A. Thornber J.P. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 242-253Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar) can be extended to their corresponding proteins, so that the latter three (minor) antenna complexes would be the Lhcb4–6 proteins, respectively (Lhcb1–3 gene products constitute the polypeptides of the bulk complex, LHCIIb). Over recent years, a large body of biochemical and spectroscopic data has been accumulated on LHCIIb, and attempts have been made to relate these results to the three-dimensional structure obtained to 3.4 Å resolution by electron crystallography (4.Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). At the same time, the apparent similarity of such features for the minor complexes have been explained in terms of a common folding pattern for the protein backbone, with only minor changes in pigment binding properties. Such assumptions are consistent with the high degree of sequence homology observed across the LHC family (5.Pichersky E. Subramaniam R. White M.J. Reid J. Aebersold R. Green B.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In particular, the minor antennaLhcb4 protein (CP29) has been the subject of intense investigation, evidencing a similar but less complicated pigment structure (6.Jennings R.C. Bassi R. Garlaschi F.M. Dainese P. Zucchelli G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3203-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7.Pascal A. Gradinaru C. Wacker U. Peterman E. Calkoen F. Irrgang K.-D. Horton P. Renger G. van Grondelle R. Robert B. van Amerongen H. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1998; 262: 817-823Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of interest to compare results betweenLhcb4 and the major protein LHCIIb for measurements giving specific information on pigment structure and binding site properties. Raman spectroscopy has been widely used for determining the interactions assumed by and the conformation of pigment molecules in photosynthetic proteins of purple and green bacteria (8.Robert B. Amesz J. Hoff A.J. Biophysical Techniques in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 161-176Google Scholar, 9.Robert B. Frank H.A. Young A.J. Britton G. Cogdell R.J. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1999: 189-201Google Scholar). More recently, this method was applied to the fucoxanthin-chlorophylla/c-protein from brown algae (10.Pascal A.A. Caron L. Rousseau B. Lapouge K. Duval J.-C. Robert B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2450-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and to LHCIIb (11.Ruban A.V. Horton P. Robert B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), both of which are members of the LHC family, and the results indicated that such measurements may be even more suited to the study of chlorophyll-containing proteins. Indeed, for such pigment-protein complexes, the resonance phenomenon (whereby the excitation light coincides with an electronic transition of the chromophore) may be used to full effect. This can lead to a 106-fold increase in the Raman signal of the chromophore relative to scattering due to any other molecules present (12.Albrecht A.C. J. Chem. Phys. 1961; 34: 1476-1484Crossref Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Additionally, as most members of the LHC family contain more than one type of chlorophyll molecule (a andc in the case of fucoxanthin-chlorophylla/c-protein; a and b for LHCIIb and Lhcb4), the matching of the excitation light with the Soret electronic transition of one or other chl type allows a near-selective excitation of each of these molecules (10.Pascal A.A. Caron L. Rousseau B. Lapouge K. Duval J.-C. Robert B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2450-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is expected that shifting the excitation wavelength within the Soret transition of one type of chl contained in these proteins may increase the contribution of a subset of these chls. Thus, excitations at 406.7 and 413.1 nm, both located within the Soret transition of chla, should lead to different Raman contributions of the unequivalent chls a bound to the protein. On the other hand, resonance Raman spectroscopy can provide precise information on the molecular conformation and configuration of carotenoid molecules, the spectra of which may be selectively obtained when exciting at wavelengths longer than 460 nm. It is thus possible, from a well chosen set of Raman spectra of a protein from the LHC family, to obtain information on the ensemble of cofactors bound to this protein. We present an investigation by resonance Raman spectroscopy of the higher plant antennae, LHCIIb and Lhcb4, in an attempt to relate apparent similarities in overall protein structure to pigment binding configurations. LHCIIb was isolated by nondenaturing isoelectric focusing of spinach photosystem II membranes as described previously (13.Dainese P. Hoyer-Hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); preparation of the Lhcb4 protein was by column chromatography of Tris-washed photosystem II (7.Pascal A. Gradinaru C. Wacker U. Peterman E. Calkoen F. Irrgang K.-D. Horton P. Renger G. van Grondelle R. Robert B. van Amerongen H. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1998; 262: 817-823Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), using a modification of the procedure described by Henrysson et al. (15.Henrysson T. Schröder W.P. Akerlund H.-E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 301-308Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded at 77 K in an SMC-TBT flow cryostat (Air Liquide, Sassenage, France) on a Varian Cary E5 double-beam scanning spectrophotometer. Protein samples for resonance Raman spectroscopy were concentrated in Microcon-30 concentrators (Amicon) to an A in the Soret region of 50–100 (∼ 1 mg chl/ml). Absorption spectra were taken before and after Raman measurements to verify sample integrity. Resonance Raman spectra at 77 K were obtained in an SMC-TBT flow cryostat using a Jobin-Yvon U1000 Raman spectrophotometer equipped with an N2-cooled, back-thinned charge-coupled device detector (Spectrum One, Jobin-Yvon, France), as described previously (16.Sturgis J.N. Robert B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Excitation was provided by Coherent argon (Innova 100) and krypton (Innova 90) lasers (457.9 and 488.0 nm and 406.7 and 413.1 nm, respectively) and a Liconix helium-cadmium laser (441.6 nm). Resonance Raman spectra of the bound xanthophyll molecules in LHCIIb andLhcb4 have been recorded using a wide range of excitations between 457.9 and 530.9 nm (data not shown). Fig.1 displays such spectra using excitation at 488.0 nm. Three carotenoids are present in these proteins in differing stoichiometries, namely lutein, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin. The spectra obtained are essentially identical to those of β-carotene, exhibiting bands grouped into four regions (called ν1 to ν4). The most intense band, ν1, is indicative of the xanthophyll conformation. This band is present at 1530 cm−1 for all-trans β-carotene, whereas upon trans → cis isomerization it is upshifted, this shift being more than 10 cm−1 for 13- or 15-cis β-carotene (17.Koyama Y. Takii T. Saiki K. Tsukida K. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1983; 5: 139-150Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of carotenoid molecules possessing a central cis bond (i.e. either 13- or 15-cis) generally results in the appearance of additional bands, arising from modes allowed by the lower symmetry of these molecules. These bands are absent in both the spectra in Fig. 1, and we did not observe them in any other resonance conditions (data not shown), whereas the ν1 band is at 1530 cm−1 for both LHCIIb and Lhcb4 and is not inhomogeneously broadened (again, this is the case for all excitation conditions, though see below). This indicates that all xanthophylls in these two proteins have a central trans configuration. It must be noted that the same conclusions could be drawn whether LHCIIb was extracted from dark-adapted or light-adapted organisms. In particular, no evidence was found for the presence of the 15-cis carotenoid forms hypothesized by Gruszecki et al. (18.Gruszecki W.I. Matula M. Ko-chi N. Koyama Y. Krupa Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 267-274Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using HPLC analysis. The presence of neoxanthin in the 9-cis configuration (19.Liaaen-Jensen S. New J. Chem. 1990; 14: 747-759Google Scholar) could, however, be responsible for excitation-dependent variations in ν1 of up to 5 cm−1 (not shown). Although the carotenoid spectra of the two proteins are very similar, some small differences can be observed. The bands discussed below are indicated in Fig. 1 by dotted lines. Around 1200 cm−1 in the ν2 region, the minor bands at 1176 and 1203 cm−1 are more intense for Lhcb4. Bands in the ν3 region (1000 cm−1) show differing relative intensities when the two proteins are compared, and an additional mode occurs at 1028 cm−1 in Lhcb4. In the ν4 region around 960 cm−1, theLhcb4 protein exhibits a small, single band with a shoulder, as is the case for isolated carotenoids (17.Koyama Y. Takii T. Saiki K. Tsukida K. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1983; 5: 139-150Google Scholar), whereas for LHCIIb this region is much more complicated, involving the presence of at least four components. In this region, out-of-plane bending modes of C-H bonds contribute, and the presence of a number of components reveals slight deviations from the planar geometry of one or more carotenoids bound to LHCIIb. The trimeric protein LHCIIb binds two lutein molecules, one neoxanthin, and about one-third of a molecule of violaxanthin per monomer (i.e. 6:3:1 per trimer), whereasLhcb4 (which is monomeric) binds the same three carotenoids but in substoichiometric amounts, two molecules per monomer in total (7.Pascal A. Gradinaru C. Wacker U. Peterman E. Calkoen F. Irrgang K.-D. Horton P. Renger G. van Grondelle R. Robert B. van Amerongen H. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1998; 262: 817-823Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14.Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 20.Giuffra E. Zucchelli G. Sandonà D. Croce R. Cugini D. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12984-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, although the precise structural significance of these differences is difficult to predict without intensive in vitro studies of the three xanthophylls present, the differences indicate either an altered pigment structure for at least one of the carotenoids, an increase in the contribution of one of them to the spectra, or (in the case of LHCIIb) the appearance of modes corresponding to the additional carotenoids present. Shown in Fig.2 are 77 K absorption spectra of LHCIIb (solid line) and Lhcb4 (dashed line). As described previously (6.Jennings R.C. Bassi R. Garlaschi F.M. Dainese P. Zucchelli G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3203-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7.Pascal A. Gradinaru C. Wacker U. Peterman E. Calkoen F. Irrgang K.-D. Horton P. Renger G. van Grondelle R. Robert B. van Amerongen H. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1998; 262: 817-823Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) these two spectra are globally similar, although the higher pigment content of LHCIIb is reflected in the presence of a number of additional components within the absorption bands of chls a and b, the most evident of them being located on the blue side of the chl a Q yband (around 670 nm) and throughout the chl b Q ytransition. The significance of this spectral similarity with respect to common structural features of the LHC proteins has been discussed at some length in the literature (see, for example, Refs. 6.Jennings R.C. Bassi R. Garlaschi F.M. Dainese P. Zucchelli G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3203-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 7.Pascal A. Gradinaru C. Wacker U. Peterman E. Calkoen F. Irrgang K.-D. Horton P. Renger G. van Grondelle R. Robert B. van Amerongen H. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1998; 262: 817-823Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is of interest to see whether these similarities in absorbance properties are reflected in resonance Raman spectra of the bound chlorophyll molecules for the two proteins: i.e. whether it corresponds to common structural motifs of their chl binding sites. Resonance Raman spectroscopy can provide important structural information on the binding site properties of (bacterio)chlorin molecules (8.Robert B. Amesz J. Hoff A.J. Biophysical Techniques in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 161-176Google Scholar). For excitation conditions within the Soret electronic transition, it has been shown that resonance Raman spectra of chlorophyll a contain a number of bands that may be used for determining accurately the conformation of these molecules in vitro, as well as in their protein binding pocket (21.Fujiwara M. Tasumi M. J. Phys. Chem. 1986; 90: 5646-5650Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22.Näveke A. Lapouge K. Sturgis J.N. Hartwich G. Simonin I. Scheer H. Robert B. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1997; 28: 599-604Crossref Google Scholar). As the molecular conformation of chl depends in particular on the number of axial ligands on the central magnesium atom, the coordination number of this atom may be deduced from the frequency of some of these bands (8.Robert B. Amesz J. Hoff A.J. Biophysical Techniques in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 161-176Google Scholar). This is notably the case for the methine bridge stretching modes; this band, observed at about 1600 cm−1 when the central magnesium is six-coordinated, is up-shifted to 1610–1615 cm−1 for five-coordinated magnesium. In resonance Raman spectra of chl b molecules, this band is extremely weak at best (23.Lutz M. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Advances in IR and Raman Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, New York1984: 211-300Google Scholar, 24.Feiler U. Albouy D. Lutz M. Robert B. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and thus, determining the coordination state of the central magnesium proves much more difficult. There is an intense band in resonance Raman spectra of chl b arising from Ca-Cb stretching modes (23.Lutz M. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Advances in IR and Raman Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, New York1984: 211-300Google Scholar) that is sensitive to the molecular core size. 2A. Pascal, unpublished results. This band is located at 1530 cm−1 when the magnesium atom of these molecules is six-coordinated, and near 1540 cm−1 when it binds one axial ligand only. However, proteins from the LHC family generally bind carotenoid molecules, the presence of which results, in resonance Raman spectra excited at 420–550 nm, in a very intense band arising from the conjugated C=C modes of these molecules at 1530 cm−1 (see above). The presence of this band impairs observation of the chl b mode, which thus cannot be used for determining the coordination of their central magnesium. In the higher frequency region of the spectra (1650–1750 cm−1), bands are observed that arise from the stretching modes of carbonyl groups conjugated with the dihydroporphyrin macrocycle, namely the C9-keto (chla and b) and C3-formyl (chlb only) groups. The position of these bands depends on the strength of the intermolecular interactions (e.g. hydrogen bonds) these chemical groups are involved in, as well as, to a lesser extent, the dielectric properties of their environment. In apolar solvents, the band arising from the stretching mode of the keto carbonyl group of chl a is located at 1695 cm−1 when this group is free from interactions; similarly, the free-from-interaction keto C=O of chlb is seen at 1701 cm−1, whereas its formyl group exhibits a stretching frequency of 1663 cm−1 when free from interactions (10.Pascal A.A. Caron L. Rousseau B. Lapouge K. Duval J.-C. Robert B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2450-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The presence of an intermolecular interaction with any of these carbonyl groups results in its stretching mode being down-shifted by up to 40 cm−1, the strength of the interaction being reflected by the extent of the shift (25.Zhadorozhnyi, B. A., and Ishchenko, I. K. (1965) Opt. Spectrosc. (English translation) 19, 306–308Google Scholar). On the other hand, an increase in the dielectric constant of the immediate environment (i.e. an increase in polarity) results in a downshift of 5–10 cm−1. The Soret electronic transitions of chls a and bdiffer by more than 1000 cm−1, their maxima being at around 430 and 450 nm, respectively. Due to these different positions, the resonance Raman spectra of chls a andb can be observed selectively by making use of the appropriate excitation wavelength. We have used the 457.9 nm line of an Argon laser to obtain selectively the chl b Raman signal (23.Lutz M. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Advances in IR and Raman Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, New York1984: 211-300Google Scholar). As discussed by Feiler et al. (24.Feiler U. Albouy D. Lutz M. Robert B. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), in these conditions of excitation, the resonance is mainly with theB x component of this electronic transition, thus resulting in a high activity of the formyl carbonyl stretching modes, whereas the keto carbonyl stretching modes are low in intensity. The latter may be more easily observed using the 441.6 nm of a helium-cadmium laser; however, these excitation conditions result in a less selective excitation of chl b, and chl amolecules then also contribute to the resonance Raman spectra (26.Lutz M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 460: 408-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 3 are Raman spectra of LHCIIb and Lhcb4 in the 1580–1720 cm−1 region obtained using both of these excitations. Although the two sets of spectra differ markedly, some similarities can be discerned. The spectra for Lhcb4 are fairly simple, exhibiting mainly three bands at 1615, 1630, and 1649 cm−1. The bands at 1630 and 1649 cm−1 may be readily attributed to formyl C=O stretching modes. These two bands thus evidence two chl bpopulations having formyl groups vibrating at different frequencies: one, at 1649 cm−1, corresponding to a formyl group either involved in a weak molecular interaction or in a polar environment, and another, at 1630 cm−1, indicating a formyl C=O involved in a medium strength hydrogen bond with its peptide environment (∼ 14 kJ/mol) (25.Zhadorozhnyi, B. A., and Ishchenko, I. K. (1965) Opt. Spectrosc. (English translation) 19, 306–308Google Scholar). Given that pigment analysis indicates only two chls b per Lhcb4 polypeptide (7.Pascal A. Gradinaru C. Wacker U. Peterman E. Calkoen F. Irrgang K.-D. Horton P. Renger G. van Grondelle R. Robert B. van Amerongen H. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1998; 262: 817-823Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar,27.Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it can be assumed that the two chl b molecules correlate with these two populations observed in the Raman spectra. The attribution of the 1615 cm−1 band requires comparison of the chl b resonance Raman spectra ofLhcb4 with those of LHCIIb. In the spectra of the latter complex, the relative intensity of this band to that of the bands arising from the formyl carbonyl stretching modes is much lower. As the relative chl a/b stoichiometry in theLhcb4 protein is more than twice that in LHCIIb (14.Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28.Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), we conclude that the 1615 cm−1 band in these spectra arises from preresonance contributions of the bound chla molecules. Comparison of these spectra reveals some important features. In Raman spectra of LHCIIb, three main bands are observed in the region corresponding to stretching modes of formyl carbonyl groups. The principal band around 1630 cm−1 corresponds well with the band at the same position in Lhcb4 for excitation at 441.6 nm, although the increase in width of the same band at 457.9 nm excitation indicates additional contributions in the 1620–1625 cm−1 region. Additional formyl stretching mode contributions are observed at 1640 and 1655 cm−1, which are not exhibited byLhcb4. The second band in the Lhcb4 protein (at 1650 cm−1) does not appear to have an equivalent mode in spectra of LHCIIb, indicating that the intermolecular interactions assumed by this pigment in Lhcb4are likely to be altered in the equivalent chl b binding site in LHCIIb. This difference between the carbonyl modes of two apparently equivalent chlorophylls in the two proteins may arise from a simple change in hydrogen bonding to the formyl group, or alternatively could reflect a change in the polarity of the binding pocket. An estimation can be made of the number of pigment molecules contributing to each band observed in the Raman spectra. It should be noted that the relative intensities of Raman bands do not depend on the stoichiometry of the corresponding populations alone, and in particular, the extent of resonance with the excitation line for each population will also have an effect on its respective contribution to the spectra. Therefore, this estimation may be somewhat inaccurate, to plus or minus one chl for the more intense bands, but is nevertheless of interest in evaluating the spectra. Given a chl bstoichiometry of five to six for monomeric LHCIIb (4.Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 29.Thornber J.P. Peter G.F. Morishige D.T. Gómez S. Anandan S. Welty B.A. Lee A. Kerfeld C. Takeuchi T. Preiss S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and considering that the 1655 cm−1 band arises from at least one chl b, the main band at 1625–1630 cm−1 must correspond to at least two, and probably three, chl b molecules, with one or two additional chls b having their formyl carbonyl groups vibrating around 1640 cm−1. Thus, three to five chlorophyllsb in LHCIIb possess a medium to strongly bound formyl C=O. Bands in the 1660–1690 cm−1 region for both proteins correspond to the keto groups of bound chlorophyll molecules. In spectra obtained with 457.9 nm excitation, it may be noted that the bands arising from the stretching modes of the keto carbonyl groups of chl b exhibit only low intensity. As discussed above, this excitation line induces a resonance mainly with theB x component of the Soret electronic transition, thus favoring the contribution of stretching modes of the formyl carbonyl of these molecules, and not of the keto carbonyl group (24.Feiler U. Albouy D. Lutz M. Robert B. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The increase in intensity of these bands for 441.6 nm excitation may reflect an increase in chl a resonance and/or the location of this wavelength within the B y absorption band of chl b. Given the similarity of these spectra with those in Fig. 4 (discussed below), it seems likely that they mainly contain contributions of chls a. Resonance Raman spectra in conditions favoring chl aexcitation (i.e. 406.7 and 413.1 nm) are shown in Fig. 4 for the two antenna proteins. Modes corresponding to the methine bridges appear at around 1612 cm−1 for both proteins and do not appear inhomogeneously broadened. This indicates that the central magnesium atoms of most if not all chl a molecules are five-coordinated in each case. In the region corresponding to bands arising from the stretching modes of the keto carbonyl groups,Lhcb4 exhibits a broad band around 1665–1680 cm−1, together with a shoulder at 1659 cm−1. The intensity of the latter, along with the known chl a stoichiometry of six (7.Pascal A. Gradinaru C. Wacker U. Peterman E. Calkoen F. Irrgang K.-D. Horton P. Renger G. van Grondelle R. Robert B. van Amerongen H. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1998; 262: 817-823Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27.Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), probably indicates the presence of two chls a with their keto carbonyls vibrating at 1659 cm−1 and thus involved in a strong intermolecular hydrogen bond. Among the four remaining chls a, three probably contribute in the 1665–1675 cm−1 region. The keto C=O groups of these molecules thus take part in medium strength hydrogen bonds. The sixth chl a molecule may be responsible for a further widening of this main band toward higher frequencies at 406.7 nm excitation; it would thus have a free-from-interaction keto carbonyl in a polar environment, vibrating near 1685 cm−1. (Note the possible inaccuracies in these estimations discussed above.) Although LHCIIb is believed to contain only one or two more chla molecules than Lhcb4, the region of the keto carbonyl stretching modes of this protein in these excitation conditions exhibits much more structure than that of theLhcb4 protein. No fewer than five distinct components may be observed, at 1659, 1670, 1678, 1685, and 1700 cm−1. The component at 1659 cm−1 is very similar to that observed inLhcb4; in particular, it appears to gain intensity in resonance conditions at 406.7 nm for both proteins. Some of the modes contributing to the central keto carbonyl region (1665–1680 cm−1), particularly those more intense for excitation at 413.1 nm, may correspond to those of Lhcb4around 1670 cm−1. However, the main band in the keto stretching mode region in LHCIIb, observed at 1685 cm−1, does not exist in Lhcb4spectra. Based on seven or eight chlorophylls a per monomer (4.Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 29.Thornber J.P. Peter G.F. Morishige D.T. Gómez S. Anandan S. Welty B.A. Lee A. Kerfeld C. Takeuchi T. Preiss S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this region may be analyzed as follows. There are probably two chls a whose keto carbonyls are strongly hydrogen bonded, vibrating at 1659 cm−1, and corresponding to two chls a in Lhcb4; three whose keto C=O groups participate in medium to strong hydrogen bonds (1670–1680 cm−1), one or two of which may correspond to chls a in Lhcb4; and probably two chla molecules whose keto groups are free from interactions but in a polar environment (1685 cm−1), as for one apparent chl a molecule in Lhcb4. The component at 1700 cm−1 arises from the stretching mode of keto carbonyl groups free from intermolecular interactions, located in a rather apolar environment; this band corresponds to one chlorophyll molecule in LHCIIb (no equivalent in Lhcb4). The possible variation in these numbers due to the inaccuracy discussed above is reflected in the range given for some of the contributions. The Raman band arising from strongly bonded keto carbonyls inLhcb4 (at 1659 cm−1) is also present in LHCIIb. Moreover, it shows a similar behavior with respect to resonance conditions in both proteins, i.e. its intensity increases at 406.7 nm excitation. It thus appears that in both of these proteins, a pair of chl a molecules is present, sharing similar protein environments, as well as absorption properties in the Soret electronic transition. A similar band has also been observed in a related antenna protein from brown algae (fucoxanthin-chla/c-protein; 10), having the same frequency and the same behavior relative to excitation conditions, which was similarly attributed to two chl a molecules. It should be noted that this population has a strongly bonded keto C=O group, and it is unlikely that such an interaction would be reproduced by chance. It is therefore tempting to conclude that this band corresponds to chlorophylls a, assuming the same conformation in equivalent chl binding pockets in these three LHC proteins, and that they represent a common structural motif of this extended gene family. Additional measurements on other LHCs will confirm whether this motif is conserved across this phylogenetically diverse set of proteins. Carotenoid resonance Raman spectra indicate similar configurations of these pigments in the two photosystem II antenna proteins, Lhcb4 and LHCIIb. All xanthophylls present exhibit a central trans conformation, as has already been described for the two central xanthophylls L1 and L2 in the atomic model (4.Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Some small differences in the spectra for the two proteins may reflect, on the one hand, the presence in LHCIIb of additional bound carotenoid molecules that appear to be in a less planar configuration, giving rise to additional modes in the ν4 region. On the other hand, bands in the spectra of Lhcb4 that do not appear for LHCIIb either indicate slightly different properties of equivalent carotenoid binding sites in the two proteins or that the same modes are present in spectra of LHCIIb but are masked by contributions of the additional xanthophylls present."
https://openalex.org/W2324517882,"Ectopic expression of the CDK inhibitors (CKIs) p16INK4a and p27Kip1 in Rat1 fibroblasts induces dephosphorylation and activation of Retinoblastoma-family proteins (pRb, p107 and p130), their association with E2F proteins, and cell cycle arrest in G1. The growth-inhibitory action of p16, in particular, is believed to be mediated essentially via pRb activation. The 12S E1A protein of human Adenovirus 5 associates with pRb-family proteins via residues in its Conserved Regions (CR) 1 and 2, in particular through the motif LXCXE in CR2. These interactions are required for E1A to prevent G1 arrest upon co-expression of CKIs. We show here that mutating either of two conserved motifs adjacent to LXCXE in CR2, GFP and SDDEDEE, also impairs the ability of E1A to overcome G1 arrest by p16 or p27. Strikingly, however, these mutations affect neither the association of E1A with pRb, p07 and p130, nor its ability to derepress E2F-1 transcriptional activity in transient transfection assays. One of the E1A mutants, however, is defective in derepressing several endogenous E2F target genes in the presence of p16 or p27. Thus, CR2 possesses an essential function besides pRb-binding. We speculate that this function might be required for the full derepression of E2F-regulated genes in their natural chromatin context."
