 Oswald Avery's proof that DNA was the transforming principle in bacteria, here he suggested that the protein
 component of viruses, rather than DNA, might have the primary role in replication. Luria later explained to historian Horace
 Judson that this oversight was primarily due to his not thinking biochemically, adding that I don't think
 we attached great importance to whether the gene was protein or nucleic acid. Luria noted that James Watson and Francis
 Crick's work on the structure of DNA in the early 1950s permanently settled the question."

https://openalex.org/W2082006514,"THE fats of animals have been shown to originate in part by synthesis from dietary carbohydrate1 and protein2, and in addition the dietary fat is generally considered to exert a marked effect on their composition. In connexion with the effect of dietary fat on the composition of the depot fat, Smedley-MacLean3 states: “Beef suet, mutton fat and lard each has a definite character of its own, but this can be modified if exceptional quantities of any particular acid are included in the diet. If, for instance, a large amount of linseed oil is supplied, a greater proportion of the liquid unsaturated acids characteristic of linseed will be stored and the fat will become softer.” Work recently carried out in this Laboratory4 does not accord completely with the generally accepted view indicated by Smedley-MaeLean. Comparison of the fats of pasture-fed animals, where the main dietary fatty constituent is linolenic acid, shows that whereas horse fat contains up to 17 per cent of this constituent and, in addition, bears some resemblance to a mixture of ‘synthetic’ fat and dietary fat, beef and mutton tallow contain little, if any, linolenic acid, and have a fatty acid composition suggesting the almost complete absence of any unmodified pasture fat. Earlier work by Thomas, Culbertson and Beard5 showed that feeding liberal allowances of highly unsaturated oils to steer calves over a period of 260 days was without perceptible effect on the mean unsaturation of the body fat. It therefore appears that, contrary to current conceptions, certain animal fats, such as beef and mutton tallow, are not appreciably modified by the nature of the dietary fat."

However, as inhibitions of more than 60 per cent were rarely attained, the results are of qualitative interest only. The authors were presumably aware of the insolubility of beryllium phosphate, since their alkaline phosphatase preparations were dialysed “to remove all traces of inorganic phosphate”2. But the inhibitor, beryllium, was added to the substrates (B. glycerophosphate or disodium phenyl phosphate) before the enzyme. These substrates undoubtedly contain inorganic phosphate in concentrations comparable to those of the inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1990414271,"A GREAT many attempts have been made to obtain in vitro fertilization of the eggs of mammals. The appearance of ovum segmentation has been interpreted as proving the penetration of spermatozoon into the oocyte (Schenk (1880), Onanoff (1873), Pincus and Enzmann (1930–39), Krassovskaja (1934), Menkin and Rock (1948)). In vitro production of parthenogenetic segmentation in the oocyte of mammals, mentioned by Champy in 1927, is a well-known fact; therefore segmentation is no criterion of fertilization. Moricard and De Fonbrune (1937), Lewis and Hartmann (1941) stated that they had not been able to obtain in vitro penetration of the spermatozoon into oocyte. So recently as December 1947, Dr. G. W. Corner, director of the Embryology Department in the Carnegie Foundation, said in a letter: “I am sorry to say that no one in this laboratory has observed the penetration of the spermatozoon into the mammalian ovum. To the best of my knowledge no such observation has ever been made in mammals.”"

https://openalex.org/W2089053184,"It is well known that the action potentials of the auditory nerve, as recorded from the round window in the cat or guinea pig in response to a train of click stimuli, are immediately reduced in amplitude in the presence of a wide band of noise of suitable intensity. We have observed that when such a masking noise is suddenly turned off, the action potentials of the click response do not regain their original size at once, but only after a period of 0.1 to 1.0 sec., depending upon the relative intensities of clicks and noise. The microphonic component of the response is similarly affected only at noise levels sufficiently intense to cause reflex contraction of the intra‐aural muscles; when this occurs the recovery of the action potentials is even longer delayed. The failure of the nerve response to regain full amplitude immediately after masking appears to bear upon the nature of the masking process itself. If masking were dependent exclusively upon the all‐or‐none properties of the nerve fiber and the maintenance of the refractory state by the noise, recovery might be expected to be complete within a few msec. after the noise ceases. We are inclined to attribute the fact that recovery is not instantaneous rather to a temporary depletion of the mechanism responsible for the initiation of excitation in the auditory nerve. The phenomenon appears to be more closely related to auditory fatigue than to intra‐cochlear inhibition, although the latter explanation has not been excluded."

hormone, to control certain phases of plant growth has
been known for a number of years (8). Concurrent with
growth and exerting some regulating influence upon it
is the process of respiration. In this study, the process
of respiration as affected by a synthetic hormone, 2,4-D,
is considered from the over-all viewpoint of oxygen
uptake and carbon dioxide release, as shown in the respiration
of excised seedling roots."

The vaccinia hæmagglutination is inhibited by sera of rabbits infected with the virus, but not significantly by those of normal rabbits. In contrast, agglutination by common lipid preparations, such as those used by Stone1, is inhibited by normal rabbit sera to a relatively high titre."

https://openalex.org/W2002927350,"IT has long been known that wool wax is hydrolysed only with great difficulty as an oil-in-water emulsion. For example, only about 40 per cent reaction is obtained after boiling with N/2 sodium hydroxide for 100 hr. We find that in a water-in-oil emulsion, hydrolysis proceeds very much more rapidly, and is complete in 6 hr. at 100° C. when 1 gm. of wax is treated with 1 ml. of 6 N sodium hydroxide. The difference between the two results is not due solely to the greater concentration of alkali as reactant, but is determined mainly by changes in the nature of the interface and the effect of reaction products upon it. These effects have been isolated in the following experiments."

The combined data include gravity observations extending from lat. 24° N. to 67° N. and from long. 52° W. to 133° W., an extent of 43° in latitude and 81° in longitude. This region includes large variations in topography and in geology, and has considerable coastal regions."
