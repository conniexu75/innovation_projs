https://openalex.org/W2003117185,"A summary of 111 studies identified in a survey of the world literature on familial resemblances in measured intelligence reveals a profile of average correlations consistent with a polygenic mode of inheritance. There is, however, a marked degree of heterogeneity of the correlations within familial groupings, which is not moderated by sex of familial pairing or by type of intelligence test used."
https://openalex.org/W1981881657,"Rats and guinea pigs, when immunized with mouse nerve growth factor, produce antibodies that cross-react with their own nerve growth factor. The antibodies reach developing offspring of these animals both prenatally (rats and guinea pigs) and postnatally (rats). Depriving the fetus of nerve growth factor in this way results in the destruction of up to 85 percent of dorsal root ganglion neurons as well as destruction of sympathetic neurons. Sensory neurons of placodal origin in the nodose ganglion were not affected. These data demonstrate that dorsal root ganglion neurons go through a phase of nerve growth factor dependence in vivo."

Shed vesicles carry procoagulant activity that can account for the activation of the clotting system and the fibrin deposition associated with these and many other types of malignancy in animals and man.
https://openalex.org/W1561028236,"Preferential solvent interactions between polyethylene glycols and five proteins were investigated by density measurements and analyzed by the multicomponent theory. These measurements were conducted as a function of concentration and molecular size of the synthetic polymer at different pH values. The results showed that proteins are preferentially hydrated under the experimental conditions employed, i.e. polyethylene glycol is excluded from the protein domain. The introduction of protein thermodynamically destabilizes the solvent system. The magnitude of instability increases with increasing concentration of the polymer. Furthermore, systems of polyethylene glycols of higher molecular weight are more destabilized. A linear relationship was observed between the magnitude of destabilization and average hydrophobicity of the proteins employed with the exception of tubulin. The system is more destabilized in the presence of proteins with higher content of hydrophilic residues indicating that the interaction between polyethylene glycol and ionized residues is thermodynamically unfavorable with a negative ion being more so than a positive one. After correcting for the contribution of ionic effect on the instability of the system it was found that at least for a protein of average hydrophobicity of 1000 cal/residue the mass of the protein contributes to the instability also. It may, therefore, be concluded that in a polyethylene glycol system the presence of protein leads to unfavorable thermodynamic interaction which in turn leads to phase separation. The causes of such unfavorable interaction include the charges residing on the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2133940096,"Treatment of the kidney epithelial cell line MDCK with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces a large increase in the permeability of tight junctions within 2-4 hr. This change in transepithelial permeability is accompanied by alterations in cell morphology that include the opening of tight junctions, loss of apical surface microvilli and the formation of cytoplasmic processes containing numerous microtubules, microfilaments and 10 nm intermediate filaments. Simultaneously, TPA also stimulates a 10-20 fold increase in the synthesis and secretion of the serine protease plasminogen activator (PA); however, the inhibition of PA synthesis by cycloheximide does not prevent the morphological changes or the increased tight junctional permeability, suggesting that PA is not involved in these early TPA-induced events. Drugs that inhibit cytoskeletal function, such as cytochalasins B and D, colchicine, and vinblastine sulfate, are all relatively effective in preventing the TPA-induced morphological changes but not the increases in transepithelial permeability. Our results provide evidence that possible sites of TPA action include epithelial tight junctions as well as components of the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2046663888,"We have developed a new method for isolating subcellular components after fixation of whole cells with formaldehyde. By a number of criteria we establish that the fixation does not alter or cause rearrangement of nucleosomal structure of either newly replicated or old chromatin. Using this approach we can almost completely resolve newly replicated chromatin from preexisting material on the basis of the difference in density. Newly replicated chromatin (even from cycloheximide-treated cells) appears to contain nucleosomes on both daughter strands. Exploiting the ability to separate newly synthesized chromatin, we have reexamined the question of the deposition of new histone at the replication fork. We find that newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are deposited onto new DNA and stay in place for a significant time. In contrast new H1 is deposited on old DNA and new H2A-H2B, while they may be transiently bound to new DNA, are largely associated with preexisting chromatin."

The major use of these techniques is to increase the reproductive rate of valuable cows. Other applications include circumventing infertility, exporting embryos, and testing potential carriers for Mendelian recessive alleles. Cryopreservation of embryos is beginning to be used commercially, and sexing embryos before transfer may soon become routine."
https://openalex.org/W1998844087,"Aversive classical conditioning of Aplysia californica, a gastropod mollusk suited for neurobiological study, produces a learned reaction to the chemosensory conditioned stimulus that is expressed as a marked facilitation of four defensive responses: two graded reflexes (head and siphon withdrawal), an all-or-none fixed act (inking), and a complex fixed action pattern (escape locomotion). In addition, the conditioned stimulus produces a concomitant depression of at least one appetitive response, feeding. These extensive and selective actions of the conditioned stimulus in Aplysia resemble the actions of conditioned fear stimuli in higher mammals and suggest that the functional equivalent of fear occurs in invertebrates and thus may be an adaptive mechanism that is widespread in the animal kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W2012241091,"Long-term infusion of glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and glycerol into the third ventricle of the rat brain caused a stabilization of body weight at a lower than normal level. Among the glucose- and glycerol-treated animals this weight loss was caused in part by temporary hypophagia. Among the animals treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate the weight loss was unaccompanied by a reduction in food intake. The results are consistent with the view that the systems controlling food intake and body weight are sensitive to the availability of brain fuels. They are not consistent however, with the view that these control systems monitor calories independently of their source."

The magnitude of the conditioned preference is greater if the pups received milk while suckling than if they did not. The results indicate that infants are capable of learning while suckling and that milk delivery plays a role in this associative process."
https://openalex.org/W1907166011,"Lysozyme solubilized in reverse micelles of bis(2-ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate in isooctane containing as little as 0.8% water (v/v) has been shown to be active. The amount of enzymatic activity depends on the water content and the pH of the reverse micellar system and under optimum conditions (i.e. pH 7.7 with 1.2% water) is 90% of the activity in water. The dependence of lysozyme activity on pH in reverse micelles is different than that in water, with the entire pH profile shifted 2 to 3 pH units higher in reverse micelles. Moreover, maximum enzyme activity is not found at the highest water contents tested (i.e. 1.6% and 2.0% water), but instead at 1.2% water. The Km for the N-acetylglucosamine oligomers used as substrate is 0.1 mM in reverse micelles (compared to 0.01 mM in water) when the concentration of substrate is referred to the water pools. Spectroscopic studies (CD, fluorescence, and UV absorbance) indicate that the conformation of lysozyme is significantly different in reverse micelles compared to water. In particular, CD studies indicate that the helical content of lysozyme changes from approximately 34% in water to approximately 48% in reverse micelles. Conformation and activity data are qualitatively correlated to the anomalous character of water in the reverse micelles. In particular, this may induce a stronger hydrogen bonding within the lysozyme which would in turn increase both the pKa of certain amino acid residues and the helical content of the macromolecule."
https://openalex.org/W1990103909,"Phase shifting circadian rhythms in rats shortly after passive avoidance training impaired their performance on retention tests. The amnesia was not due to simple performance deficits accompanying the ""jet leg"" effects of phase shifting or to differences in lighting or circadian phase at training and at testing. Amnesia was associated with specific rhythm reentrainment patterns. These data indicate that disrupting circadian organization can produce retrograde amnesia in rats."

When they immersed voluntarily they showed no bradycardia, but when the same birds were forcibly held under water there was a rapid drop in heart rate to well below that at rest. This decrease indicates that ther may be a large component of emotional stress in the heart rate records from previous diving studies where restrained animals were forcibly submerged."

Diurnal fluctuations in pain sensitivity were observed. The fluctuations followed food intake patterns rather than a natural circadian rhythm, with food deprivation producing a decrease in pain sensitivity. The analgesic response produced by this mild food deprivation was strongly attenuated by naloxone or feeding, suggesting that endogenous opioid systems may be related to patterns of food intake."

Thus, the telencephalon in teleosts, as in amniote species, contains regions that receive specific sensory input. Therefore, this lemniscal organization is not restricted to mammalian or amniote species but is a feature common to most, if not all, vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2096853306,"Nematodes construct thick filaments in body-wall muscle cells using three major protein components: two kinds of myosin and paramyosin. We report the isolation and enrichment of thick filaments from wild type and mutant strains of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and their examination by electron microscopy. We have compared the morphology and distribution of lengths of isolated filaments from the wild type N2, the unc-15 mutant lacking paramyosin E1214 and the unc-54 mutant lacking specific body-wall myosin E190. Our studies indicate that very long filaments can be isolated from both N2 and the E190 lacking 60% of the normal amount of myosin and that the mean length of the isolated filaments and filament fragments in these strains is 3.2 and 3.3 μm, respectively. However, when similar preparations of thick filaments isolated from E1214 were examined, no long filaments were observed and the mean length was 1.0 μm. Most of the E1214 filaments exhibited prominent central bare zones and double tapered ends. The mean length of this normally distributed subpopulation was 1.53 μm. For comparison, we determined the in situ length of wild type N2 thick filaments (by polarized light microscopy of body-wall muscle) to be 9.7 μm. The diameters of the wild type N2 and the myosin mutant E190 thick filaments were 25 nm uniformly along their length, whereas the paramyosin mutant E1214 filaments showed wider diameters of 32 nm along most of their length. We conclude that functional paramyosin is necessary for the determination of thick filament length and diameter in nematode body-wall muscle cells in vivo. The presence of both body-wall myosins and other myofibrillar components appear insufficient for determination of thick filament structure in these muscles. Both body-wall myosins are unnecessary for the formation of long thick filaments of normal diameter: the presence of one form of myosin, paramyosin and other myofibrillar components is sufficient. We discuss the relevance of these findings to thick filament assembly and myofibrillar organization in general."
https://openalex.org/W1483306607,"The transport function of the purified monosaccharide transporter from human erythrocytes has been investigated. By a cycle of cholate solubilization and removal, the purified transporter was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles of about 300 A diameter, at a density of about one per vesicle. This distribution permitted an all-or-none assay for transport activity, in which the fraction of the intravesicular volume that rapidly equilibrated with D-glucose in the medium yielded an estimate of the moles of protein functional in transport. It was found that almost every transporter molecule capable of binding cytochalasin B was also capable of transport. The rate of transporter-catalyzed exchange of D-glucose between the medium and the vesicles at equilibrium was also measured. In this assay, the transport activity of the purified protein, expressed per mol of cytochalasin B binding of site, was about 5% of that of the transporter in the intact erythrocyte under similar conditions. These results show that the reduced transport activity of the purified transporter found in various rate assays is due to most of the molecules functioning at a lower rate, rather than a few molecules functioning at the in vivo rate."
https://openalex.org/W1573938885,"Acetylcholine receptors were solubilized from electric organ membranes of Torpedo californica in mixed micelles of sodium cholate and soybean lipids. Sodium cholate, when supplemented with relatively low amounts of soybean lipids (cholate:lipid, 20:1, molar ratio), was effective in solubilizing receptors without denaturing their agonist-regulated cation channels. Another dialyzable detergent, octylglucoside, denatured the ion channel even in the presence of excess lipids. Reassembly of receptors and lipids into vesicles was achieved by cholate dialysis. About 70% of the receptors were oriented with their toxin binding sites on the external surface of the vesicles. Evidence suggests that all of the receptors in a single vesicle were oriented either right side out or inside out. During the reassembly process about 10-fold greater lipid concentrations were required for the preservation of channel function. At lipid/protein ratios greater than 16:1 (w/w), receptors reassembled into vesicles at a constant protein/lipid ratio. These vesicles contained approximately 7% receptors by weight, 5-fold less than the native membrane. The remainder of the lipid assembled into small vesicles which did not contain receptors. At lipid/protein ratios less than 16:1 (w/w), receptors reassociated with lipids in higher weight ratios. Irreversible inactivation of a fraction of the acetylcholine receptor channels occurred in proportion to the greater packing density. This channel denaturation was accompanied by a lowered susceptibility of the disulfide bond between the delta subunits of the acetylcholine receptor dimer to reducing agents. Toxin binding and the orientation of the receptors in the reconstituted vesicles was not affected by reduced lipid/protein ratios. The unexpected constant acetylcholine receptor/lipid ratio in the reconstituted vesicles and the unexpected uniform orientation of the acetylcholine receptors within a vesicle are discussed in terms of the interactions occurring during the initial nucleation events of the reassembly process."
https://openalex.org/W1486827359,"Androgen-binding protein (ABP) was purified from caput epididymis of the rat by sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, dihydrotestosterone-17 beta-hemisuccinyl-1,6-diaminohexane-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-150. The final product migrated as a single band corresponding to a peak of protein-bound [3H]dihydrotestosterone on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A molecular weight of 100,000 was estimated by sedimentation equilibrium. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, subunits of Mr = 47,000 and 41,000 were observed. Amino acid analysis indicated ABP to be rich in leucine while nonpolar aminoacids totaled only 51%. Its carbohydrate content is 25%. Antibodies to purified ABP were raised in a rabbit and evaluated by immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, binding inhibition, radioimmunoassay, and immunocytochemistry. Immunoperoxidase staining localized ABP in the basal and adluminal regions of seminiferous tubules of rat testis and in secretory granules of cultured Sertoli cells. In principal cells of caput epididymis, ABP is concentrated in the supranuclear region known to contain morphological specializations for absorption. These immunocytochemical results confirm that ABP synthesized and secreted by Sertoli cells in the testis is transported to the epididymal duct via testicular fluid and is taken up by epithelial cells of the proximal segments."
https://openalex.org/W1561665832,"Incubation of phosphatidylcholine vesicles with isolated high density lipoproteins (HDL) or with whole plasma results in transfer of phospholipid into HDL. To investigate the mechanisms of this process, small unilamellar vesicles of egg phosphatidylcholine were incubated with human HDL3 (d 1.125 to 1.210 g/ml) or with plasma and were subsequently analyzed by density gradient ultracentrifugation and negative stain electron microscopy. Incubation of vesicles with isolated HDL3 resulted in formation of both discoidal lipoproteins (1.04 to 1.06 g/ml) and phospholipid-enriched spherical lipoproteins (1.10 to 1.14 g/ml). The lipid bilayer discoidal lipoproteins had dimensions approximately 22 X 5.4 nm and contained phospholipid, apoA-I, and apoA-II. The phospholipid-enriched sperical HDL were increased in diameter and decreased in density compared to HDL3. With maximum phospholipid uptake these lipoproteins had a similar density, size, and lipid composition to HDL2a, a phospholipid-rich subfraction of HDL isolated from human plasma between 1.100 to 1.125 g/ml. Scanning microcalorimetry of the phospholipid-enriched HDL showed, compared to HDL3, a decrease in the temperature and enthalpy of lipoprotein denaturation. This altered denaturation pattern was similar to that of plasma HDL2a. Following incubation of vesicles in plasma, there was an increase in phospholipid-rich lipoproteins within the HDL2 density range (1.070 to 1.125 g/ml), and disappearance of lipoproteins from the HDL3 density range (1.125 to 1.210 g/ml). The phospholipid-rich HDL2 contained a major peak (d 1.095 to 1.125 g/ml), which consisted of only spherical particles and a smaller peak (d 1.070 to 1.095 g/ml), which included a population of lipid bilayer discs. Thus, during incubation of vesicles with isolated HDL3, there is insertion of phospholipid into HDL3, producing spherical lipoproteins which have some properties in common with HDL2a. Discoidal lipoproteins are also formed, probably as a result of interaction of vesicles with small amounts of apoA-I and apoA-II released from HDL3. The uptake of phosphatidylcholine by HDL in whole plasma occurs by similar mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1517944983,"Interaction of bilirubin with phospholipid liposomes was studied at varying pH. Liposomes were prepared from egg-phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, egg-phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine with 5% (w/w) cholesterol, phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelin, and a lipid preparation from cat brain. Experiments were also conducted with erythrocyte ghosts. Interaction with bilirubin was studied by observing quenching of fluorescence from 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, incorporated in the lipid bilayers, by gradient centrifugation of the product, by measuring light scattering during the process, and by studying the solubility and infrared spectra of the final aggregates. At pH values above 8.2, the findings are consistent with formation of a bilirubin dianion-phospholipid complex. At pH 6-8, protonization of bilirubin in the complex is indicated and is followed by self-aggregation of bilirubin acid with formation of large bilirubin particles containing a small amount of phospholipid. Results were qualitatively similar with all lipids studied; marked quantitative differences in degree of fluorescence quenching and aggregation rates were observed with liposomes from different phospholipids. Reflections on affinities and available concentrations indicate that this train of processes may be part of the toxic mechanism of bilirubin."

https://openalex.org/W1506890550,"Saframycin A is antitumor antibiotic structurally characterized by twin heterocyclic quinone skeletons and alpha-cyanoamine moiety. The binding of saframycin A to DNA was investigated using the antibiotic labeled at different positions. Heterocyclic quinone skeletons were biosynthetically labeled with [14C]tyrosine. The cyano residue of saframycin A was specifically labeled as a result of the reaction of [14C]cyanide with a derivative of saframycins, decyanosaframycin A, in the culture filtrate. When calf thymus DNA was incubated with [14C]tyrosine-labeled saframycin A in the presence of dithiothreitol, radioactivities were progressively recovered from DNA fraction. In contrast, saframycin A in the absence of dithiothreitol was completely devoid of reactivity toward DNA. When [14C]cyanide-labeled saframycin A was reacted with DNA, however, none of the radioactivity was associated with DNA. The release of cyano residue from the antibiotic was triggered by the reduction. Thus, conversion of quinone to hydroquinone skeletons as well as conversion of alpha-cyanoamine to immonium or alpha-carbinolamine is the consequence of the reduction. The fact that dithiothreitol-inducible binding of saframycin A to DNA was blocked by the addition of excess cyanide indicates that immonium or alpha-carbinolamine is the actual species involved in the interaction with DNA. The striking similarities between saframycin A and anthramycin in regard to the mode of binding to DNA are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2007049081,"We have uniformly labeled calmodulin with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (CaM-RITC) and used the derivative as a molecular probe in order to identify available, unoccupied calmodulin-binding sites. In mildly fixed (3% formalin) cultured 3T3 cells, the biologically active CaM-RITC bound predominantly to mitochondria. Binding was markedly reduced in the presence of 1 mM EGTA. Stelazine, a phenothiozine which binds to calmodulin, prevented the interaction of CaM-RITC with mitochondrial sites. A 10 fold excess of unlabeled CaM competitively inhibited binding. Fluorescently labeled troponin C and parvalbumin did not bind to mitochondria on any other cellular organelle. Rhodamine (TMRITC) alone did not bind to 3T3 mitochondria. Similar results were obtained using 125I-calmodulin binding to isolated rat liver mitochondria. When solubilized mitochondrial proteins were subjected to calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and eluted with 1 mM EGTA, there were two major polypeptides 120,000 and 67,000 daltons and at least three minor species (100,000, 60,000 and 40,000 daltons). The interaction required an active Ca2+-CaM complex and is specific for CaM. Double fluorescent staining with CaM-RITC and fluorescein-labeled antibodies to tubulin and DNAase I revealed a mitochondrial distribution pattern similar to that of microtubule arrays but unrelated to actin cabling. There was no evidence that CaM-RITC directly interacted with either microtubules or microfilaments."

This carbohydrate alteration is akin to the types of structural variation termed microheterogeneity and is thought not to affect the biological activities of glycoproteins that manifest the phenomenon. However, the carbohydrate change expressed by the mutants is stable and heritable, and 125I-lectin-binding studies suggest that it profoundly alters their surface recognition properties. The mutation appears to affect a specific subpopulation of galactose residues in asparagine-linked carbohydrate of the type found associated with the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus. The mutant cells also exhibit morphological changes in substratum culture."

In addition, H-Y (H-W) appeared selectively in the ovaries of ZZ genetic males that had been induced to become functional females by exposure to estradiol.

When treatment was initiated 3 weeks prior to mating this effect was not observed. Daily administration of the opiate antagonist naloxone from day 14 of gestation through term, to precipitate withdrawal in utero, resulted in increased stillbirths, decreased pup weight and size, and weight loss 24 hours after birth. These data question the validity of animal experiments which purport to be models for methadone maintenance programs but in which treatment is started immediately prior to or soon after conception.

https://openalex.org/W2043271197,"We have analyzed a temperature-sensitive mutant, ts4, of Nicotiana tabacum, together with its newly isolated second revertant, Rt1, both in cell culture and as a regenerated plant. Cells of the temperature-sensitive mutant will grow only below 30 degrees C, whereas the revertant can grow at temperatures above that but not at those as high as will wild-type cells. Enzyme assays of phenylalanine ammonia lyase and nitrate reductase showed that ts4 had substantial increases and decreases, respectively. The revertant resembled ts4 for these activities. The decrease in nitrate reductase is associated with resistance of ts4 to a pulse of chlorate that kills wild-type. Amino acid and polyamine analyses showed that ornithine levels rise in ts4 during 24 hr at the high temperature, while spermine and spermidine levels fall. The ts4 mutant has low levels of ornithine decarboxylase activity and s-adnosyl-methionine decarboxylase activity, whereas the revertant has restored levels of only ornithine decarboxylase. This is the only enzyme activity in which Rt1 resembles wild-type more than it resembles ts4, suggesting that it is the site of metabolic alteration of the mutation. In regenerated plants, ts4 has a low chlorophyll content, while the revertant has a fully restored chlorophyll content. Flowers on the revertant plant are both male and female sterile, with the male sterility associated with anthers converted into petals. The correlations among these ts4 and Rt1 alterations demonstrate novel regulatory interactions between nitrate reductase and the two decarboxylase enzymes, and also suggest that we have partially unravelled the molecular basis for a particular developmental endpoint."

Injection of naloxone caused a significant increase in the motility of the opiate-exposed fetuses but had no effect on control fetuses. That naloxone's effect was an expression of opiate withdrawal and not due to antagonism of depressed motility is also supported by the observation that naloxone significantly reduced the hatchability of opiate-exposed chicks and not of control chicks. Thus the withdrawal of a developing organism from a narcotic may be more deleterious to its survival than continued exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1560107977,"Helminthosporium sacchari infects certain clones of sugar cane and produces a toxin with the same plant selectivity as the fungus itself. The toxin was purified by use of activated charcoal plus thin layer, gel, and ion exchange chromatography. Gas chromatography (GC) of a trimethylsilyl derivative of toxin gave a single peak. Toxin was characterized by GC, mass spectroscopy (MS), and NMR spectroscopy. The spectra of hydrolytic products showed that toxin contains galactose plus a C15H21 moiety which appears to be a sesquiterpene. Spectral data and methylation procedures showed that toxin contains an oligosaccharide composed of beta, 1 leads to 5 galactofuranose units (probably 5 units). Several interconvertible forms of the C15H21 moiety were evident after acid hydrolysis. Toxin was separated from 3 closely related, nontoxic compounds (noxins), which contained galactose plus the C15H21 moiety. Comparative data show that the toxin examined in this study is the same as the toxin described by Steiner and Strobel (Steiner, G. W., and Strobel, G. A. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 4350-4357). The data also show that the previously proposed structure is incorrect."
