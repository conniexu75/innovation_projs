https://openalex.org/W4220893211,"Unlimited generation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is an attractive approach for ""off-the-shelf"" CAR T cell immunotherapy. Approaches to efficiently differentiate iPSCs into canonical αβ T cell lineages, while maintaining CAR expression and functionality, however, have been challenging. We report that iPSCs reprogramed from CD62L+ naive and memory T cells followed by CD19-CAR engineering and 3D-organoid system differentiation confers products with conventional CD8αβ-positive CAR T cell characteristics. Expanded iPSC CD19-CAR T cells showed comparable antigen-specific activation, degranulation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion compared with conventional CD19-CAR T cells and maintained homogeneous expression of the TCR derived from the initial clone. iPSC CD19-CAR T cells also mediated potent antitumor activity in vivo, prolonging survival of mice with CD19+ human tumor xenografts. Our study establishes feasible methodologies to generate highly functional CAR T cells from iPSCs to support the development of ""off-the-shelf"" manufacturing strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4220807143,"Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is an appealing method for measuring blood flow and thus infer brain activity, but it relies on the physiology of neurovascular coupling and requires extensive signal processing. To establish to what degree fUSI trial-by-trial signals reflect neural activity, we performed simultaneous fUSI and neural recordings with Neuropixels probes in awake mice. fUSI signals strongly correlated with the slow (<0.3 Hz) fluctuations in the local firing rate and were closely predicted by the smoothed firing rate of local neurons, particularly putative inhibitory neurons. The optimal smoothing filter had a width of ∼3 s, matched the hemodynamic response function of awake mice, was invariant across mice and stimulus conditions, and was similar in the cortex and hippocampus. fUSI signals also matched neural firing spatially: firing rates were as highly correlated across hemispheres as fUSI signals. Thus, blood flow measured by ultrasound bears a simple and accurate relationship to neuronal firing."
https://openalex.org/W4220828029,"Non-cell-autonomous mechanisms contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), in which astrocytes release unidentified factors that are toxic to motoneurons (MNs). We report here that mouse and patient iPSC-derived astrocytes with diverse ALS/FTD-linked mutations (SOD1, TARDBP, and C9ORF72) display elevated levels of intracellular inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), a ubiquitous, negatively charged biopolymer. PolyP levels are also increased in astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) from ALS/FTD astrocytes. ACM-mediated MN death is prevented by degrading or neutralizing polyP in ALS/FTD astrocytes or ACM. Studies further reveal that postmortem familial and sporadic ALS spinal cord sections display enriched polyP staining signals and that ALS cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exhibits increased polyP concentrations. Our in vitro results establish excessive astrocyte-derived polyP as a critical factor in non-cell-autonomous MN degeneration and a potential therapeutic target for ALS/FTD. The CSF data indicate that polyP might serve as a new biomarker for ALS/FTD."

https://openalex.org/W4220689846,"The autonomic nervous system is a master regulator of homeostatic processes and stress responses. Sympathetic noradrenergic nerve fibers decrease bone mass, but the role of cholinergic signaling in bone has remained largely unknown. Here, we describe that early postnatally, a subset of sympathetic nerve fibers undergoes an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced cholinergic switch upon contacting the bone. A neurotrophic dependency mediated through GDNF-family receptor-α2 (GFRα2) and its ligand, neurturin (NRTN), is established between sympathetic cholinergic fibers and bone-embedded osteocytes, which require cholinergic innervation for their survival and connectivity. Bone-lining osteoprogenitors amplify and propagate cholinergic signals in the bone marrow (BM). Moderate exercise augments trabecular bone partly through an IL-6-dependent expansion of sympathetic cholinergic nerve fibers. Consequently, loss of cholinergic skeletal innervation reduces osteocyte survival and function, causing osteopenia and impaired skeletal adaptation to moderate exercise. These results uncover a cholinergic neuro-osteocyte interface that regulates skeletogenesis and skeletal turnover through bone-anabolic effects."
https://openalex.org/W4220962950,"In recent years it has become apparent that the epithelium is highly involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathophysiology. The majority of gene expression studies of IBD are generated from heterogeneous biopsies, providing no distinction between immune cells, the epithelium and other mucosal cells. By using laser capture microdissection (LCM) coupled with RNA sequencing, we aimed to characterize the expressional changes of the isolated colonic epithelial monolayer from ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients compared to healthy controls (HC). The analysis identified 3706 genes as differentially expressed between active IBD epithelium and HC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to stratify genes into modules, which were subsequently characterized using enrichment analysis. Our data show a distinct upregulation of the antigen presentation machinery during inflammation, including major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (e.g. HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRA) and key transcription factors/activators (STAT1, IRF1, CIITA). We also see an epithelial downregulation of retinoic acid-responsive nuclear receptors (RARA, RARB, RXRA), but upregulation of retinoid-metabolizing enzymes (RDH11, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3), which together suggest a perturbation of epithelial vitamin A signaling during active IBD. Lastly, we identified a cluster of stress-related genes, including activator protein 1 components JUNB and ATF3, as significantly upregulated in active UC but not in CD, revealing an interesting aspect of IBD heterogeneity. The results represent a unique resource for enhanced understanding of epithelial involvement in IBD inflammation and is a valuable tool for further studies on these processes."
https://openalex.org/W4220982881,"Abnormal nuclear morphology is a hallmark of malignant cells widely used in cancer diagnosis. Pelger-Huët anomaly (PHA) is a common abnormality of neutrophil nuclear morphology of unknown molecular etiology in myeloid neoplasms (MNs). We show that loss of nuclear lamin B1 (LMNB1) encoded on chromosome 5q, which is frequently deleted in MNs, induces defects in nuclear morphology and human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function associated with malignancy. LMNB1 deficiency alters genome organization inducing in vitro and in vivo expansion of HSCs, myeloid-biased differentiation with impaired lymphoid commitment, and genome instability due to defective DNA damage repair. Nuclear dysmorphology of neutrophils in patients with MNs is associated with 5q deletions spanning the LMNB1 locus, and lamin B1 loss is both necessary and sufficient to cause PHA in normal and 5q-deleted neutrophils. LMNB1 loss thus causes acquired PHA and links abnormal nuclear morphology with HSCs and progenitor cell fate determination via genome organization."
https://openalex.org/W4221034312,"The simple structure of phosphatidic acid (PA) belies its complex biological functions as both a key phospholipid biosynthetic intermediate and a potent signaling molecule. In the latter role, PA controls processes including vesicle trafficking, actin dynamics, cell growth, and migration. However, experimental methods to decode the pleiotropy of PA are sorely lacking. Because PA metabolism and trafficking are rapid, approaches to accurately visualize and manipulate its levels require high spatiotemporal precision. Here, we describe recent efforts to create a suite of chemical tools that enable imaging and perturbation of PA signaling. First, we describe techniques to visualize PA production by phospholipase D (PLD) enzymes, which are major producers of PA, called Imaging Phospholipase D Activity with Clickable Alcohols via Transphosphatidylation (IMPACT). IMPACT harnesses the ability of endogenous PLD enzymes to accept bioorthogonally tagged alcohols in transphosphatidylation reactions to generate functionalized reporter lipids that are subsequently fluorescently tagged via click chemistry. Second, we describe two light-controlled approaches for precisely manipulating PA signaling. Optogenetic PLDs use light-mediated heterodimerization to recruit a bacterial PLD to desired organelle membranes, and photoswitchable PA analogs contain azobenzene photoswitches in their acyl tails, enabling molecular shape and bioactivity to be controlled by light. We highlight select applications of these tools for studying GPCR-Gq signaling, discovering regulators of PLD signaling, tracking intracellular lipid transport pathways, and elucidating new oncogenic signaling roles for PA. We envision that these chemical tools hold promise for revealing many new insights into lipid signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4220786255,"Telenephrology has become an important health care delivery modality during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about patient perspectives on the quality of care provided via telenephrology compared to face-to-face visits. We aimed to use objective data to study patients' perspectives on outpatient nephrology care received via telenephrology (phone and video) versus face-to-face visits.We retrospectively studied adults who received care in the outpatient Nephrology & Hypertension division at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, from March to July 2020. We used a standardized survey methodology to evaluate patient satisfaction. The primary outcome was the percent of patients who responded with a score of good (4) or very good (5) on a 5-point Likert scale on survey questions that asked their perspectives on access to their nephrologist, relationship with care provider, their opinions on the telenephrology technology, and their overall assessment of the care received. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and chi-square tests were used as appropriate to compare telenephrology versus face-to-face visits.3,486 of the patient encounters were face-to-face, 808 phone and 317 video visits. 443 patients responded to satisfaction surveys, and 21% of these had telenephrology encounters. Established patients made up 79.6% of telenephrology visits and 60.9% of face-to-face visits. There was no significant difference in patient perceived access to health care, satisfaction with their care provider, or overall quality of care between patients cared for via telenephrology versus face-to-face. Patient satisfaction was also equally high.Patient satisfaction was equally high amongst those patients seen face-to-face or via telenephrology."
https://openalex.org/W4220670327,"Alterations of cholesterol metabolism have been described for many neurodegenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease in the brain and age-related macular degeneration in the retina. Recent evidence suggests that glaucoma, which is characterized by the progressive death of retinal ganglion cells, could also be associated with disruption of cholesterol homeostasis. In the present study we characterized cholesterol metabolism in a rat model of laser-induced intraocular hypertension, the main risk factor for glaucoma. Sterol levels were measured using gas-chromatography and cholesterol-related gene expression using quantitative RT-PCR at various time-points. As early as 18 hours after the laser procedure, genes implicated in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake were upregulated (+49% and +100% for HMG-CoA reductase and LDLR genes respectively, vs. naive eyes) while genes involved in efflux were downregulated (-26% and -37% for ApoE and CYP27A1 genes, respectively). Cholesterol and precursor levels were consecutively elevated 3 days post-laser (+14%, +40% and +194% for cholesterol, desmosterol and lathosterol, respectively). Interestingly, counter-regulatory mechanisms were transcriptionally activated following these initial dysregulations, which were associated with the restoration of retinal cholesterol homeostasis, favorable to ganglion cell viability, one month after the laser-induced ocular hypertension. In conclusion, we report here for the first time that ocular hypertension is associated with transient major dynamic changes in retinal cholesterol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4220770375,"With the increasing use of real-time monitoring procedures in clinical practice, psychological time series become available to researchers and practitioners. An important interest concerns the identification of pattern transitions which are characteristic features of psychotherapeutic change. Change Point Analysis (CPA) is an established method to identify the point where the mean and/or variance of a time series change, but changes of other and more complex features cannot be detected by this method. In this study, an extension of the CPA, the Pattern Transition Detection Algorithm (PTDA), is optimized and validated for psychological time series with complex pattern transitions. The algorithm uses the convergent information of the CPA and other methods like Recurrence Plots, Time Frequency Distributions, and Dynamic Complexity. These second level approaches capture different aspects of the primary time series. The data set for testing the PTDA (300 time series) is created by an instantaneous control parameter shift of a simulation model of psychotherapeutic change during the simulation runs. By comparing the dispersion of random change points with the real change points, the PTDA determines if the transition point is significant. The PTDA reduces the rate of false negative and false positive results of the CPA below 5% and generalizes its application to different types of pattern transitions. RQA quantifiers also can be used for the identification of nonstationary transitions in time series which was illustrated by using Determinism and Entropy. The PTDA can be easily used with Matlab and is freely available at Matlab File Exchange (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/80380-pattern-transition-detection-algorithm-ptda)."
https://openalex.org/W4220787914,"Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) is the only precursor for the creatine synthesis of vertebrates. Creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr) are able to provide energy for the rapid growth and development of the muscle tissue. This study evaluated the effects of dietary different levels GAA on growth performance, GAA absorption and creatine metabolism of lambs. Twenty-four 3-month-old healthy Kazakh male lambs (body weight = 27.35± 0.58 kg) were randomly divided into four groups with 6 lambs in each group. The lambs were fed with the basal diets supplemented with 0 (0 mg/kg group), 500 (500 mg/kg group), 1000 (1000 mg/kg group) and 1500 mg (1500 mg/kg group) GAA per kg diet (DM basis), respectively. The results showed that, as the GAA content of the diet increased, there was a quadratic change in DMI, with the lowest in the 500 mg/kg group and the highest in the 0 mg/kg group. The CK enzyme activity and ATP content in quadriceps muscle increased linearly with increasing levels of diary GAA in the diet. PCr levels and ADP levels in the longest dorsal muscle increased linearly with increasing levels of GAA in the diet. The relative expression of SLC6A6 and SLC6A8 mRNA in the jejunum and ileum mucosa showed a quadratic change as the dietary GAA level increased, with the lowest relative expression in both the 1500 mg/kg group. With the increase of dietary GAA level, both Cr concentration in hepatic vein plasma and the portal plasma GAA concentration shows a quadratic change, with the highest concentration in the 500 mg/kg group and the lowest concentration in the 0 mg/kg group. Therefore, dietary supplementation with 500~1000 mg/kg DM GAA is recommended for lambs."
https://openalex.org/W4220677665,"Although 37.5-51% of transgender adults state they would've considered freezing gametes before gender-affirming therapy if offered and 24-25.8% of transgender adolescents express interest in having biological children, less than 5% of transgender adolescents have opted for fertility preservation. We sought to assess fertility preservation utilization in our multidisciplinary adolescent gender clinic. We also aimed to identify fertility preservation utilization and interest among non-binary adolescents and young adults. A retrospective review was conducted of patients seen in the Stanford Pediatric & Adolescent Gender Clinic from October 2015 through March 2019 who were >10 years of age at initial visit. All individuals with documented discussion of fertility preservation were offered referral for formal fertility preservation consultation but only 24% of patients accepted. Only 6.8% of individuals subsequently underwent fertility preservation (n = 9). Transfeminine adolescents are more likely to pursue fertility preservation than transmasculine adolescents (p = 0.01). The rate of fertility preservation in non-binary adolescents did not significantly differ from those in transfeminine adolescents (p = 1.00) or transmasculine adolescents (p = 0.31). Although only one non-binary individual underwent fertility preservation, several more expressed interest with 36% accepting referral (n = 4) and 27% being seen in consultation (n = 3). Despite offering fertility preservation with designated members of a gender clinic team, utilization remains low in transgender adolescents. Additionally, non-binary adolescents and their families are interested in fertility preservation and referrals should be offered to these individuals. Further studies and advocacy are required to continue to address fertility needs of transgender adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4220941593,"High plasma lipid levels have been demonstrated to increase cardiovascular disease risk. Despite advances in treatments to decrease plasma lipids, additional therapeutics are still needed because many people are intolerant or nonresponsive to these therapies. We previously showed that increasing cellular levels of microRNA-30c (miR-30c) using viral vectors or liposomes reduces plasma lipids and atherosclerosis. In this study, we aimed to synthesize potent miR-30c analogs that can be delivered to hepatoma cells without the aid of viral vectors and lipid emulsions. We hypothesized that modification of the passenger strand of miR-30c would increase the stability of miR-30c and augment its delivery to liver cells. Here, we report the successful synthesis of a series of miR-30c analogs by using different chemically modified nucleosides. In these analogs, we left the active sense strand untouched so that its biological activity remained unaltered, and we modified the passenger strand of miR-30c to enhance the stability and uptake of miR-30c by hepatoma cells through phosphorothiorate linkages and the addition of GalNAc. We show that these analogs significantly reduced apolipoprotein B secretion in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells and human primary hepatocytes without affecting apolipoprotein A1 secretion and cellular lipid levels. Our results provide a proof of concept that the passenger strand of miR-30c can be modified to increase its stability and delivery to cells while retaining the potency of the sense strand. We anticipate these miR-30c analogs will be useful in the development of more efficacious analogs for the treatment of hyperlipidemias and cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4220995466,"Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) plays important roles in mitochondrial DNA compaction, transcription initiation, and in the regulation of processes like transcription and replication processivity. It is possible that TFAM is locally regulated within the mitochondrial matrix via such mechanisms as phosphorylation by protein kinase A and nonenzymatic acetylation by acetyl-CoA. Here, we demonstrate that DNA-bound TFAM is less susceptible to these modifications. We confirmed using EMSAs that phosphorylated or acetylated TFAM compacted circular double-stranded DNA just as well as unmodified TFAM and provide an in-depth analysis of acetylated sites on TFAM. We show that both modifications of TFAM increase the processivity of mitochondrial RNA polymerase during transcription through TFAM-imposed barriers on DNA, but that TFAM bearing either modification retains its full activity in transcription initiation. We conclude that TFAM phosphorylation by protein kinase A and nonenzymatic acetylation by acetyl-CoA are unlikely to occur at the mitochondrial DNA and that modified free TFAM retains its vital functionalities like compaction and transcription initiation while enhancing transcription processivity."
https://openalex.org/W4220683242,"Purpose Normative data on the growth and development of the upper airway across the sexes is needed for the diagnosis and treatment of congenital and acquired respiratory anomalies and to gain insight on developmental changes in speech acoustics and disorders with craniofacial anomalies. Methods The growth of the upper airway in children ages birth to 5 years, as compared to adults, was quantified using an imaging database with computed tomography studies from typically developing individuals. Methodological criteria for scan inclusion and airway measurements included: head position, histogram-based airway segmentation, anatomic landmark placement, and development of a semi-automatic centerline for data extraction. A comprehensive set of 2D and 3D supra- and sub-glottal measurements from the choanae to tracheal opening were obtained including: naso-oro-laryngo-pharynx subregion volume and length, each subregion’s superior and inferior cross-sectional-area, and antero-posterior and transverse/width distances. Results Growth of the upper airway during the first 5 years of life was more pronounced in the vertical and transverse/lateral dimensions than in the antero-posterior dimension. By age 5 years, females have larger pharyngeal measurement than males. Prepubertal sex-differences were identified in the subglottal region. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the importance of studying the growth of the upper airway in 3D. As the lumen length increases, its shape changes, becoming increasingly elliptical during the first 5 years of life. This study also emphasizes the importance of methodological considerations for both image acquisition and data extraction, as well as the use of consistent anatomic structures in defining pharyngeal regions."
https://openalex.org/W4220825761,"This study aimed at evaluating the orbital anatomy of patients concerning the relevance of orbital anatomy in the etiology of EO (endocrine orbitopathy) and exophthalmos utilizing a novel approach regarding three-dimensional measurements. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism in orbital anatomy was analyzed.Orbital anatomy of 123 Caucasian patients (52 with EO, 71 without EO) was examined using computed tomographic data and FAT software for 3-D cephalometry. Using 56 anatomical landmarks, 20 angles and 155 distances were measured. MEDAS software was used for performing connected and unconnected t-tests and Spearman´s rank correlation test to evaluate interrelations and differences.Orbital anatomy was highly symmetrical with a mean side difference of 0.3 mm for distances and 0.6° for angles. There was a small albeit statistically significant difference in 13 out of 155 distances in women and 1 in men concerning patients with and without EO. Two out of 12 angles showed a statistically significant difference between female patients with and without EO. Regarding sex, statistically significant differences occurred in 39 distances, orbit volume, orbit surface, and 2 angles. On average, measurements were larger in men. Concerning globe position within the orbit, larger distances to the orbital apex correlated with larger orbital dimensions whereas the sagittal position of the orbital rim defined Hertel values.In this study, little difference in orbital anatomy between patients with and without EO was found. Concerning sex, orbital anatomy differed significantly with men presenting larger orbital dimensions. Regarding clinically measured exophthalmos, orbital aperture anatomy is an important factor which has to be considered in distinguishing between true exophthalmos with a larger distance between globe and orbital apex and pseudoexophthalmos were only the orbital rim is retruded. Thus, orbital anatomy may influence therapy regarding timing and surgical procedures as it affects exophthalmos."
https://openalex.org/W4220838772,"Much debate exists about the role of light to moderate alcohol intake and subsequent cognitive function. The apolipoprotein E genotype may modify the relationship.Using data from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, a longitudinal population-based cohort (n = 2,416), Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to measure midlife alcohol intake (average age = 52 years) and later life cognitive function (average age = 87 years) and to explore the role of apolipoprotein E genotype.No protective effect of light drinking (>1 drink/month- 1 drink/day) or moderate drinking (>1-2 drinks/day) was observed in the cohort in adjusted models (HR = 1.013, CI:0.88-1.16; HR = 1.104, CI:0.91-1.34, respectively). Heavy drinking (>2-4 drinks/day) and very heavy drinking (>4 drinks/day) increased the risk for incident moderate cognitive impairment (HR = 1.355, CI:1.09-1.68; HR = 1.462, CI:1.04-2.05, respectively). When examining the relationship by apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status, a similar dose-response pattern was observed in both groups with higher hazard ratios for those carrying at least one copy of the apolipoprotein E ℇ4 allele. As alcohol level increased, the age at incident moderate cognitive impairment decreased, especially among those with at least one apolipoprotein E ℇ4 allele.We did not observe a significant protective effect for light to moderate drinking in midlife and subsequent cognitive impairment in this cohort. Heavy drinking increased the risk for moderate cognitive impairment and decreased the age at incidence, as did carrying at least one allele of the apolipoprotein E ℇ4 gene."
https://openalex.org/W4220850782,"Gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) can regulate gametogenesis via modulation of neuroendocrine signaling. However, the effect of gWAT on the local microenvironment of the gonad was largely unknown. Herein, we ruled out that gWAT had a neuroendocrine effect on gonad function through a unilateral lipectomy strategy, in which cutting off epididymal white adipose tissue could reduce seminiferous tubule thickness and decrease sperm counts only in the adjacent testis and epididymis of the affected gonad. Consistent with the results in males, in females, ovary mass was similarly decreased by lipectomy. We determined that the defects in spermatogenesis were mainly caused by augmented apoptosis and decreased proliferation of germ cells. Transcriptome analysis suggested that lipectomy could disrupt immune privilege and activate immune responses in both the testis and ovary on the side of the lipectomy. In addition, lipidomics analysis in the testis showed that the levels of lipid metabolites such as free carnitine were elevated, whereas the levels of glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were decreased, which indicated that the metabolic niche was also altered. Finally, we show that supplementation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine could partially rescue the observed phenotype. Collectively, our findings suggest that gWAT is important for gonad function by not only affecting whole-body homeostasis but also via maintaining local metabolic and immune niches."

All patients admitted for delivery or miscarriage care were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for immunoglobulin (I)gM, and/or IgG by immunochromatography. Clinical aspects and obstetric outcomes were analyzed. A total of 265 pregnant women were included in the study. There were 38 (14.4%) PCR positive cases during pregnancy, 12 (31.6%) on admission screening, and 71(27.2%) patients were IgM- and/or IgG-positive. Among the participants, 86 (32.4%) had at least one positive test during pregnancy. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had greater contact with known positive patients (p = 0.005). The most frequently reported symptoms were runny nose, cough, loss of smell and taste, headache, and fever. There was also a 35% rate of asymptomatic infections and a 4.6% rate of severe or critical infections. Patients exposed or infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a higher incidence of preterm delivery, cesarean section, need for resuscitation in the delivery room, Apgar score <7 at 5 min, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and jaundice. Newborns with at least one positive test had a significantly greater need for phototherapy after delivery (p = 0.05). The results showed a high rate of positive tests among newborns (37.5%), which seems to be compatible with both neonatal and perinatal infection.It is important to further investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, including the clinical course and the possibility of adverse outcomes with impact on maternal and fetal health, regardless of the development of symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4220655560,"The literature on perceived novelty and product evaluation has diverged into two disparate streams of research. The first stream builds on theories of curiosity and argues that the perceived novelty of a new product benefits product evaluation because it induces curiosity and provides evaluators (e.g., customers) with positive experiences in learning new features of the product and in resolving their curiosity. In contrast, the second stream adopts theories of expectation violations and argues that perceived novelty decreases product evaluation because it violates evaluators’ expectations of a new product and requires burdensome efforts to make sense of the product. The main goal of our research is to resolve this theoretical inconsistency by offering an integrative model of new product evaluation that proposes an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship between perceived novelty and product evaluation. Based on this model, we further examine whether a producer’s reputation plays an ironic moderating role in this curvilinear relationship. Utilizing content analysis and big data approaches with a large sample of 49,835 reviews of 147 movies in the movie industry, we found that an evaluator’s perception of the novelty of a new movie benefited product evaluation but only when that perceived novelty was moderate; at higher levels of perceived novelty, the product evaluation decreased. In addition, we compared the curves of high vs. low reputation producers and found that perceived novelty penalized product evaluation of new movies created by high reputation producers."

https://openalex.org/W4220964357,"The imbalance between prooxidants and antioxidants in biological systems, known as oxidative stress, can lead to a disruption of redox signaling by the reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and is related to severe diseases. The most vulnerable moiety targeted by oxidant species in the redox signaling pathways is the thiol (SH) group in the cysteine residues, especially in its deprotonated (S-) form. Cysteine, along with its oxidized, disulfide-containing form, cystine, constitute one of the most abundant low molecular weight biological redox couples, providing a significant contribution to the redox homeostasis in living systems. In this work, NMR spectra from cysteine, cystine, and cysteine-containing small peptides were thoroughly studied at the submolecular level, and through the chemical shift data set of their certain atoms it is possible to estimate either thiolate basicity or the also related standard redox potential. Regression analysis demonstrated a strong linear relationship for chemical shift vs thiolate logK of the cysteine microspecies data. The αCH 13C chemical shift is the most promising estimator of the acid-base and redox character."
https://openalex.org/W4221098769,"Growing concern of antibiotic resistance has increased research efforts to find nonspecific treatments to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms. In this regard, photodynamic inactivation is a promising method. It is based on the excitation of a photosensitizer molecule (PS) with UV-Vis radiation to produce reactive oxygen species. The high reactivity of such species nearby the PS leads to oxidation of bacterial cell walls, lipid membranes (lipid peroxidation), enzymes, and nucleic acids, eventually producing cell death. In the last decade, many studies have been carried out with different photosensitizers to suppress the growth of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and malignant tumors. Here, our main motivation is to employ pheomelanin nanoparticles as sensitizers for inhibiting the growth of the Gram-negative bacteria E . coli , exposed to blue and UVA radiation. In order to perform our experiments, we synthesized pheomelanin nanoparticles from L-DOPA and L-cysteine through an oxidation process. We carried out experiments at different particle concentrations and different energy fluences. We found that cultures exposed to UVA at 166 μg/mL and 270 J/cm 2 , in conjunction with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an enhancer, decreased in the viable count 5 log10. Different reactive oxygen species (singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and peroxynitrates) were detected using different procedures. Our results suggest that the method reported here is effective against E . coli , which could encourage further investigations in other type of bacteria."

The completed review case notes were entered into an electronic system and a quality control check-up was done. Data were analysed descriptively, and findings were presented in tables.There were 4,898 births, and 1,175 neonatal admissions, out of these there were 135 recorded stillbirths (2.8%) and 201(4.1% of the total hospital births) early neonatal deaths. Out of the 1,175 neonates, 635 (54%) were born within the hospital and 540 (46%) were admitted from other facilities and home deliveries. In total 86 stillbirths and 140 early neonatal deaths case notes were retrieved and audited. Out of 86 stillbirths' case notes audited, 30 (34.9%) seemed to have died during labor, and of these 5 had audible fetal heart rate during admission. Apgar scores less than 7 at 5 minutes, prematurity, and meconium aspiration were the top three recorded causes of neonatal deaths. Inadequate/late antenatal care visits and home delivery were the maternal factors likely to have contributed to perinatal deaths. Inadequate labor monitoring (12%) and documentation (62%) were among the providers' factors likely to have contributed to perinatal deaths.This audit shows that there are high rates of preventable intrapartum stillbirths and early neonatal deaths. Both women and providers' factors were found to have contributed to the stillbirths and neonatal deaths.

Previous conventional studies have used elaborate and costly optical motion capture systems, which not only represent a considerable expense but also require participants to visit a laboratory. To overcome these shortcomings, we aimed to develop a practical and inexpensive solution for measuring obstacle-crossing behavior by using the Microsoft Azure Kinect, one of the most promising markerless motion capture systems. We validated the Azure Kinect as a tool to measure foot clearance and compared its performance to that of an optical motion capture system (Qualisys). We also determined the effect of the Kinect sensor placement on measurement performance. Sixteen healthy young men crossed obstacles of different heights (50, 150, and 250 mm). Kinect sensors were placed in front of and beside the obstacle as well as diagonally between those positions. As indices of measurement quality, we counted the number of measurement failures and calculated the systematic and random errors between the foot clearance measured by the Kinect and Qualisys. We also calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients between the Kinect and Qualisys measurements. The number of measurement failures and the systematic and random error were minimized when the Kinect was placed diagonally in front of the obstacle on the same side as the trail limb. The high correlation coefficient (r &gt; 0.890) observed between the Kinect and Qualisys measurements suggest that the Azure Kinect has excellent potential for measuring foot clearance during obstacle-crossing tasks."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether PODXL and ITGB1 are useful preoperative markers for the prognosis of postoperative pancreatic cancer patients in comparison with the TNM staging system. Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-PODXL and anti-ITGB1 antibodies on 24 pancreatic cancer tissue samples preoperatively obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to investigate if the UICC TNM stage and upregulation of PODXL and ITGB1 were correlated with postoperative overall survival rates. Univariate analysis revealed that PODXL, TNM stage, lymphatic invasion and the combination of PODXL with ITGB1 are correlated with postoperative survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated TNM stage and the combination of PODXL with ITGB1 to be correlated with postoperative survival, and the combination of PODXL with ITGB1 most accurately predicted the postoperative outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients before resection. Therefore, upregulation of PODXL and ITGB1 may indicate preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer patients by accurately predicting the postoperative prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4220747503,"The yearly increase in government R&amp;D investment and top-down national R&amp;D investment allocation requires a more quantitative decision-making system that maximizes R&amp;D performance and efficient budget allocation. Sound decision-making is necessary at both the selection stage and the pursuit stage in order to maximize limited national R&amp;D resources. We study Korean smart farms as an example to examine national R&amp;D investment from the various R&amp;D actors (academia, industry, and research institutes) perspectives. The objective of our research is to evaluate the theoretical efficiency of R&amp;D investment on specific technologies in smart farms and compare the results with expert opinions where the reality is reflected. To be specific, our study is to provide the quantitative approach in making decision among policymakers by reflecting the field experiences and opinions. We use a data envelopment analysis with an assurance region model, which integrates an analytic hierarchy process and a data envelopment analysis. The weights of output in DEA model by the R&amp;D actors are similar to the overall weight by all actors, implying that investment allocation decisions in the smart farm sector are not significantly affected by the R&amp;D actors. We realized that the relative efficiency of some R&amp;D technologies increases after reflecting qualitative ideas of experts. In reality, it is necessary to invest in these technology groups, but they excluded from top-down decision-making. This also shows that a government’s top-down decision-making can distort its investment allocation. This study proposes a new approach to compensate for the difference between theoretical virtual prices and actual prices in data envelopment analysis. In particular, when comparing the only quantitative results on investment priorities with analysis results by additionally reflecting the opinions of experts in each sector, we found that the Korean government’s investment priorities in the smart farm field are considerably distorted. Therefore, this study is expected to be used as an alternative for policy makers to compensate for the quantitative distortion might be caused by top-down national R&amp;D investment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4220922478,"Academic success at University is increasingly believed to be a combination of personal characteristics like grit, resilience, strength-use, self-control, mind-set and wellbeing. The authors have developed a short 12-item measure of tenacity, the Bolton Uni-Stride Scale (BUSS) which incorporates these elements. Previous work in the UK had established the reliability and validity of the BUSS. The present paper reports the findings of an International validation of BUSS across 30 countries ( n = 1043). Participants completed the BUSS alongside other recognised scales. Factor analysis revealed an almost identical two-factor solution to previous work and the reliability and validity of the scale were supported using an international sample. The authors recommend however that the scale be used as a single score combining all 12 items. In the light of this, the authors suggest that the BUSS will be a useful measure to incorporate in studies of academic attainment."

The cumulative effect can be used to create individual risk profile. The purpose of this study was to create a polygenic risk score and determine the genetic variants associated with sepsis.We sequenced ~14 million single nucleotide polymorphisms with a minimac imputation quality R2>0.3 and minor allele frequency >10-6 in patients with Sepsis-2 or Sepsis-3. Genome-wide association was performed using Firth bias-corrected logistic regression. Semi-parsimonious logistic regression was used to create polygenic risk scores and reduced regression to determine the genetic variants independently associated with sepsis.2261 patients had sepsis and 13,068 control patients did not. The polygenic risk scores had good discrimination: c-statistic = 0.752 ± 0.005 for Sepsis-2 and 0.752 ± 0.007 for Sepsis-3. We found 772 genetic variants associated with Sepsis-2 and 442 with Sepsis-3, p<0.01. After multivariate adjustment, 100 variants on 85 genes were associated with Sepsis-2 and 69 variants in 54 genes with Sepsis-3. Twenty-five variants were present in both the Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 groups out of 32 genes that were present in both groups. The other 7 genes had different variants present. Most variants had small effect sizes.Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 have both separate and shared genetic variants. Most genetic variants have small effects sizes, but cumulatively, the polygenic risk scores have good discrimination."

https://openalex.org/W4220684929,"To evaluate the impact of catch-up human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on conization rates in France in a large population-based study.We conducted a retrospective real-life cohort study on data collected prospectively by French National Health Insurance. Echantillon généralistes des bénéficiaires (EGB) is a database composed of demographic and health care utilization data for a 1/97th sample of the French population. We extracted data about all women born between 1983 and 1991, corresponding to the catch-up population (vaccination after 14 years old) at the time of implementation of HPV vaccination. The primary outcome was the occurrence of conization (all types of procedures) compared between vaccinated and non-vaccinated women.The cohort consisted of 42,452 women. Vaccination coverage (at least one dose) was low (9.8%, n = 4,129), but increased with time from vaccine implementation, from 0% in the 1983 cohort to 31% in the 1991 cohort. The conization rate was 1% for the overall population. The risk of conization for women between the ages of 19 and 30 years was reduced in the vaccinated group with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.59 (95% CI[0.39-0.90]; p = 0.043).With a 10-year follow-up, catch-up HPV vaccination is associated with risk reduction of conization between the ages of 19 and 30."
https://openalex.org/W4220761352,"A series of model tests are carried out on flexible retaining walls such as cantilevered piles, continuous walls, and sheet pile walls in the foundation pit to study the deformation, failure surface, and earth pressure distribution of soils in a passive zone. The shape, displacement, and shear strain of slip failure surface of sand in a passive area are analyzed by Particle Image Velocimetry. The slip failure surface is a broken line, the upper end slides out from the top of the soil, and the lower end is close to the zero displacements of the retaining wall. With the increase of the flexural deformation and horizontal displacement of the wall, the shear strain of the soil increases, and the shear fracture zone in the upper part of the sliding surface is more prominent. Based on the broken line rupture surface in the test results, the passive area can be divided into two zones, the limit state zone and the non-limit state zone. Then the mechanical models are set up respectively. Considering soil displacement, the upper and lower soil layer’s internal friction angle and wall-soil interface friction angle mobilize differently. The relationship between mechanical parameters along the retaining wall and horizontal displacement is estimated. Finally, the earth pressure distribution is obtained by using the horizontal differential layer method. The calculation results of this paper are consistent with the existing research results and the model test results in terms of earth pressure distribution. With the increase of depth, the unit earth pressure increases in the limit state zone. Still, after entering the non-limit state zone, the unit earth pressure rises to a certain extent and decreases rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W4220777905,"Vaginal delivery, compared with Cesarean delivery, remains a less chosen mode of delivery for twin pregnancy. We studied the maternal and perinatal outcomes of twin pregnancy with different modes of delivery.A retrospective study with data collected from a regional hospital, including vital twin pregnancies delivered at gestational age of 32 weeks and above. Medical charts were reviewed for prenatal conditions and postpartum outcomes.Ninety-eight pairs of twins were included and 44.9% were delivered via vaginal delivery. Women in the vaginal delivery group were significantly younger (32.5 ±4.3 years versus 34.8 ±4.6 years, p < 0.01), multiparous (34.1% versus 18.5%) and with more twins in vertex-vertex presentation (70.5% versus 33.3%) compared with women in the Cesarean delivery group. There were no differences between maternal postpartum complications and neonatal outcomes in both groups. The outcomes showed longer inter-twin delivery time interval (5.7 ± 5.6 versus 1.5 ± 0.9 min, p < 0.01), less estimated blood loss (198.7 ± 144.1 versus 763.2 ± 332.3 mL, p < 0.01), and shorter maternal hospital stay (3.0 ± 0.5 versus 5.7 ± 0.5 days, p< 0.01) in the vaginal delivery group. Twenty newborns had Apgar score below seven at birth. Logistic regression analysis revealed that low Apgar score was independently related to younger maternal age, maternal obstetric diseases and fetal non-vertex presentation. Gestational weeks and mode of delivery were not related to low Apgar score.With careful case selection, vaginal delivery could be safely performed in twin pregnancies with less estimated blood loss and better recovery than Cesarean delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4220836008,"Jumonji domain-containing protein-3 (JMJD3), a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, promotes endothelial regeneration, but its function in neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) has not been explored. In this study, we examined the contribution of endothelial JMJD3 to NIH of AVFs and the mechanisms underlying JMJD3 expression during kidney failure. We found that endothelial JMJD3 expression was negatively associated with NIH of AVFs in patients with kidney failure. JMJD3 expression in endothelial cells (ECs) was also downregulated in the vasculature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) mice. In addition, specific knockout of endothelial JMJD3 delayed EC regeneration, enhanced endothelial mesenchymal transition, impaired endothelial barrier function as determined by increased Evans blue staining and inflammatory cell infiltration, and accelerated neointima formation in AVFs created by venous end to arterial side anastomosis in CKD mice. Mechanistically, JMJD3 expression was downregulated via binding of transforming growth factor beta 1-mediated Hes family transcription factor Hes1 to its gene promoter. Knockdown of JMJD3 enhanced H3K27 methylation, thereby inhibiting transcriptional activity at promoters of EC markers and reducing migration and proliferation of ECs. Furthermore, knockdown of endothelial JMJD3 decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide production, leading to the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that decreased expression of endothelial JMJD3 impairs EC regeneration and function and accelerates neointima formation in AVFs. We propose increasing the expression of endothelial JMJD3 could represent a new strategy for preventing endothelial dysfunction, attenuating NIH, and improving AVF patency in patients with kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W4220921801,"Background Health facility delivery is vital in reducing maternal mortality however, the percentage of deliveries taking place in health facilities were remained below 50%. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess spatial variation and determinant factors of home delivery in Ethiopia. Methods We used cross-sectional survey data from Ethiopian Mini Demographics and health 2019. A total of 5,527 reproductive-age women were included in this study. ArcGIS 10.7 was applied to explore the spatial distribution of home delivery and Sat scan 9.6.1 version software was used for spatial cluster analysis. A mixed effect multilevel binary logistic regression model was fitted for determinant factors due to the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence level was used to declare significant determinants of home delivery. Result According to EMDHS 2019, the spatial variation of home delivery was non-random across the country. Somali, Afar, SNNPR, and part of Amhara were hot spot areas, where some parts of Benishangul, central Oromia, Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and Harari were identified as cold spot areas. The odds of women who had primary, secondary and higher education was decreased by 50% (AOR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.42–0.61), 72% (AOR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.19–0.40) and 90% (AOR = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.05–0.19) as compared to women no-education respectively. Mothers who had ANC visits were 70% (AOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.26–0.36) less likely to have a home birth as compared to women who had no ANC visit. The odds of having home birth among rural residents were 5.2 times (AOR = 5.2; 95% CI: 3.11–8.55) more likely higher compared to the counterpart. Conclusion The prevalence of home delivery in Ethiopia was still more than half percent. The spatial distribution was varied across the region. Maternal age, religion, wealth status, had ANC visit, birth order, region, and residence were significant factors with home delivery. Therefore, improving maternal educational status, interventional design in hotspot region, and inspire the mother to take antenatal care is essential to reduce the prevalence of home delivery."

It is imperative to identify women at risk of developing preeclampsia in the effort to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes through early intervention. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) level changes are noticeable several weeks before the onset of preeclampsia and its related complications. This study evaluated the feasibility of the sFlt-1/PlGF biomarker ratio in predicting preeclampsia and adverse pregnancy outcomes using a single cut-off point of >38.This is a prospective cohort study conducted at a single tertiary centre, in an urban setting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between December 2019 and April 2021. A total of 140 medium to high risk mothers with singleton pregnancies were recruited at ≥20 weeks' gestation. sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was measured and the participant monitored according to a research algorithm until delivery. The primary outcome measure was incidence of preeclampsia and the secondary outcome measure was incidence of other adverse pregnancy outcomes.The overall incidence of preeclampsia was 20.7% (29/140). The mean sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was significantly higher in preeclampsia (73.58 ± 93.49) compared to no preeclampsia (13.41 ± 21.63) (p = 0.002). The risk of preeclampsia (adjusted OR 28.996; 95% CI 7.920-106.164; p<0.001) and low Apgar score (adjusted OR 17.387; 95% CI 3.069-98.517; p = 0.028) were significantly higher among women with sFlt-1/PlGF ratio >38 compared with sFLT-1/PlGF ratio ≤38. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) for a combined approach (maternal clinical characteristics and biomarker) was 86.9% (p<0.001, 95% CI 78.7-95.0) compared with AUC biomarker alone, which was 74.8% (p<0.001, 95% CI 63.3-86.3) in predicting preeclampsia. The test sensitivity(SEN) was 58.6%, specificity (SPEC) 91%,positive predictive value (PPV) 63% and negative predictive value (NPV) 89.3% for prediction of preeclampsia. For predicting a low Apgar score at 5 minutes, the SEN was 84.6%, SPEC 87.4%, PPV 40.7%, and NPV 98.2%; low birth weight with SEN 52.6%,SPEC 86.0%, PPV 37.0%, NPV 92.0%; premature delivery with SEN 48.5%, SPEC 89.5%, PPV 59.3%, NPV 84.7% and NICU admission with SEN 50.0%, SPEC 85.8%, PPV 37.0% and NPV 91.2%.It is feasible to use single cut-off point of >38 ratio of the biomarkers sFlt-1/PlGF in combination with other parameters (maternal clinical characteristics) in predicting preeclampsia and adverse pregnancy outcomes among medium to high risk mothers without restricting outcome measurement period to 1 and 4 weeks in a single urban tertiary centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."

In P. tetraurelia and P. bursaria, it was sufficiently possible to distinguish specific strains depending on the pattern of random primers and amplification characteristics. For the classification of P. caudatum, based on the sequence data obtained by RAPD-PCR analysis, 5 specific primer sets were designed and a multiplex PCR method was developed. The comparative analysis of 2 standard strains, 12 recommended strains, and 12 other strains of P. caudatum provided by the National BioResource Project was conducted, and specific strains were identified.

https://openalex.org/W4221071611,"An important question when setting appropriate air quality standards for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is whether there exists a ""threshold"" in the concentration-response (C-R) function, such that PM2.5 levels below this threshold are not expected to produce adverse health effects. We hypothesize that measurement error may affect the recognition of a threshold in long-term cohort epidemiological studies. This study conducts what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first simulation of the effects of measurement error on the statistical models commonly employed in long-term cohort studies. We test the degree to which classical-type measurement error, such as differences between the true population-weighted exposure level to a pollutant and the observed measures of that pollutant, affects the ability to statistically detect a C-R threshold. The results demonstrate that measurement error can obscure the existence of a threshold in a cohort study's C-R function for health risks from chronic exposures. With increased measurement error the ability to statistically detect a C-R threshold decreases, and both the estimated location of the C-R threshold and the estimated hazard ratio associated with PM2.5 are attenuated. This result has clear implications for determining appropriate air quality standards for pollutants."

At the same time, research on the predictive indices of diabetes in Chinese minority populations is lacking. Therefore, this study determines the relationship between different anthropometric indices and diabetes, and identifies the best index and best cut-off values for predicting diabetes. Method In total, 11,035 Dong and Miao ethnic participants (age: 30–79 years) from the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort study were included. The logistic regression model was used to examine the relationship between the different anthropometric indices and diabetes risk. The receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to identify the best predictor of diabetes. Results In multivariate adjusted logistic regression models, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), and visceral adiposity index (VAI) were positively correlated with diabetes risk. Among Chinese Dong men and women and Miao men, WHR had the largest AUC (0.654/0.719/0.651). Among Miao women, VAI had the largest AUC(0.701). The best cut-off values of WHR for Dong men and women and Miao men were 0.94, 0.92, and 0.91, respectively. The best cut-off value of VAI for Miao women was 2.20.

In terms of recognizing people, there have been a few recent studies on neural network-based approaches for solving the open set gait recognition problem using wearable devices. Typically, these approaches determine decision boundaries in the latent space with a limited number of samples. Motivated by the fact that such methods are sensitive to the values of hyper-parameters, as our first contribution, we propose a new network model that is less sensitive to changes in the values using a new prototyping encoder-decoder network architecture. As our second contribution, to overcome the inherent limitations due to the lack of transparency and interpretability of neural networks, we propose a new module that enables us to analyze which part of the input is relevant to the overall recognition performance using explainable tools such as sensitivity analysis (SA) and layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP)."

Since EBOV detailed mechanism has not been identified so far, it would be useful to understand the growth and spread of EBOV dynamics based on mathematical methods and simulation approaches. Computational approaches such as Cellular Automata (CA) have the advantage of simplicity over solving complicated differential equations. The spread of Ebola virus in lymph nodes is studied using a simplified Cellular Automata model with only four parameters. In addition to considering healthy and infected cells, this paper also considers T lymphocytes as well as cell movement ability during the simulation in order to investigate different scenarios in the dynamics of an EBOV system. It is shown that the value of the probability of death of T cells affects the number of infected cells significantly in the steady-state. For a special case of parameters set, the system shows oscillating dynamics. The results were in good agreement with an ordinary differential equation-based model which indicated CA method in combination with experimental discoveries could help biologists find out more about the EBOV mechanism and hopefully to control the disease."

Methods Twenty-two individuals with chronic complete and incomplete motor SCI between 18–65 years old were recruited to participate in the current trial. Using high-resolution respirometry, mitochondrial respiratory capacity was measured for PBMCs and muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis oxidizing complex I, II, and IV substrates. NIRS was used to assess mitochondrial capacity of the vastus lateralis with serial cuff occlusions and electrical stimulation. Results Positive relationships were observed between PBMC and permeabilized muscle fibers for mitochondrial complex IV (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.0001). Bland-Altman displayed agreement for complex IV (MD = 0.18, LOA = -0.86 to 1.21), between PBMCs and permeabilized muscles fibers. No significant relationships were observed between NIRS mitochondrial capacity and respiration in permeabilized muscle fibers. Conclusions This is the first study to explore and support the agreement of less invasive clinical techniques for assessing mitochondrial respiratory capacity in individuals with SCI. The findings will assist in the application of PBMCs as a viable alternative for assessing mitochondrial health in persons with SCI in future clinical studies."

However, the historical knowledge of temporal and spatial biodiversity is lacking. To determine the value and trend of crop diversity in Iran, we used biodiversity indices based on the area under rainfed and irrigated crops and total cropland area from 1991 to 2018. There were large fluctuations in the amount of cultivated area in the past 30 years, peaking around 2005 to 2007 with about 13.1 million cultivated hectares. However, no general trend in increase or decrease of total cultivated land was shown. The crop species diversity of irrigated cropland was higher than the rainfed and total cropland. The Shannon diversity index showed a constant trend with a negligible slope, but species richness was increased, which was related to the rise in the area of some crop species in recent years. The area of wheat and barley had a significant impact on crop diversity, so Shannon diversity index reduced with their dominance. Overall, this study revealed that the Iranian agricultural system relies on wheat and barley. We warn that by increasing the area of these crops and the prevalence of monoculture, the probability of damage from external factors such as sudden weather changes or the spread of diseases will increase, leading to instability and production risks in the future."

Despite the high mortality rate, an effective vaccine against this mosquito-borne infectious disease is yet to be developed. Up to date, RTS,S/AS01 is the only vaccine available for malaria prevention; however, its efficacy is low. Among a variety of malaria antigens, merozoite surface protein-1(MSP-1) and ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) have been proposed as promising candidates for malaria vaccine development. We developed peptide-based Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidates that incorporated three previously reported conserved epitopes from MSP-1 and RESA into highly effective liposomal polyleucine delivery system. Indeed, MSP-1 and RESA-derived epitopes conjugated to polyleucine and formulated into liposomes induced higher epitope specific antibody titres. However, immunized mice failed to demonstrate protection in a rodent malaria challenge study with Plasmodium yoelii . In addition, we found that the three reported P . falciparum epitopes did not to share conformational properties and high sequence similarity with P . yoelii MSP-1 and RESA proteins, despite the epitopes were reported to protect mice against P . yoelii challenge."
https://openalex.org/W4221091925,"Large grazing mammals should negatively affect forage biomass of their food supply, but documentation is lacking in free ranging populations. Furthermore, complications from factors such as weather patterns and spatial heterogeneity might obscure grazing effects on the food supply. We examined influences of Roosevelt elk ( Cervus canadensis roosevelti (Merriam, 1897)) abundance and precipitation on forage biomass at two spatial scales; meadows that contained most of the food supply, and sectors nested in meadows. Spatial heterogeneity in forage biomass might also decline with increasing elk abundance. Elk abundance was estimated from population counts and varied 3.9-fold across the 15 years of study in northwestern California, USA. Each January, early in the growing season, we estimated forage biomass in the 50-ha meadow complex used by the elk population. Measures of palatable forage cover and height were taken in 270 ¼ m 2 plots dispersed throughout sectors. These measurements were then related to dried forage biomass. At both spatial scales, elk abundance was inversely, and precipitation was positively related to forage biomass. At the sector scale, analysis of a linear mixed effect model indicated heterogeneity. In some sectors both predictors were related to forage biomass and in other sectors they were not. Heterogeneity was not from uneven elk grazing as elk grazed sectors in proportion to forage biomass. The varied elk abundance–forage biomass relationships across sectors indicated that spatial heterogeneity declined with increasing elk abundance. Detecting relationships between free ranging ungulate populations and biomass of their food supply is not straightforward."
