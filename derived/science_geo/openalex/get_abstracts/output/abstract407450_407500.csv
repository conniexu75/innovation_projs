https://openalex.org/W1985473475,"Imbalance of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is one of several causes of seizures. ATP has also been implicated in epilepsy. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the release of ATP from cells and the consequences of the altered ATP signaling during seizures. Pannexin1 (Panx1) is found in astrocytes and in neurons at high levels in the embryonic and young postnatal brain, declining in adulthood. Panx1 forms large-conductance voltage sensitive plasma membrane channels permeable to ATP that are also activated by elevated extracellular K+ and following P2 receptor stimulation. Based on these properties, we hypothesized that Panx1 channels may contribute to seizures by increasing the levels of extracellular ATP. Using pharmacological tools and two transgenic mice deficient for Panx1 we show here that interference with Panx1 ameliorates the outcome and shortens the duration of kainic acid-induced status epilepticus. These data thus indicate that the activation of Panx1 in juvenile mouse hippocampi contributes to neuronal hyperactivity in seizures."
https://openalex.org/W1995388616,"Inorganic phosphate (P(i)) and iron are essential nutrients that are depleted by vertebrates as a protective mechanism against bacterial infection. This depletion, however, is sensed by some pathogens as a signal to turn on the expression of virulence genes. Here, we show that the PhoB-PhoR two-component system senses changes in P(i) concentration, whereas the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) senses changes in iron concentration in Edwardsiella tarda PPD130/91 to regulate the expression of type III and VI secretion systems (T3SS and T6SS) through an E. tarda secretion regulator, EsrC. In sensing low P(i) concentration, PhoB-PhoR autoregulates and activates the phosphate-specific transport operon, pstSCAB-phoU, by binding directly to the Pho box in the promoters of phoB and pstS. PhoB also binds with EsrC simultaneously on the promoter of an E. tarda virulence protein, evpA, to regulate directly the transcription of genes from T6SS. In addition, PhoB requires and interacts with PhoU to activate esrC and suppress fur indirectly through unidentified regulators. Fur, on the other hand, senses high iron concentration and binds directly to the Fur box in the promoter of evpP to inhibit EsrC binding to the same region. In addition, Fur suppresses transcription of phoB, pstSCAB-phoU, and esrC indirectly via unidentified regulators, suggesting negative cross-talk with the Pho regulon. Physical interactions exist between Fur and PhoU and between Fur and EsrC. Our findings suggest that T3SS and T6SS may carry out distinct roles in the pathogenicity of E. tarda by responding to different environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W2028965478,"Preferential binding of proteins on curved membranes (membrane curvature sensing) is increasingly emerging as a general mechanism whereby cells may effect protein localization and trafficking. Here we use a novel single liposome fluorescence microscopy assay to examine a common sensing motif, the amphipathic helix (AH), and provide quantitative measures describing and distinguishing membrane binding and sensing behavior. By studying two AH-containing proteins, α-synuclein and annexin B12, as well as a range of AH peptide mutants, we reveal that both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of the helix greatly influence binding and sensing. Although increased hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with the membrane both lead to greater densities of bound protein, the former yields membrane curvature-sensitive binding, whereas the latter is not curvature-dependent. However, the relative contributions of both components determine the sensing of AHs. In contrast, charge density in the lipid membrane seems important primarily in attracting AHs to the membrane but does not significantly influence sensing. These observations were made possible by the ability of our assay to distinguish within our samples liposomes with and without bound protein as well as the density of bound protein. Our findings suggest that the description of membrane curvature-sensing requires consideration of several factors such as short and long range electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and the volume and structure of inserted hydrophobic residues.

https://openalex.org/W1987497394,"EGFR mutations correlate with improved clinical outcome whereas KRAS mutations are associated with lack of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is being increasingly used in the management of NSCLC. Co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature (COLD)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (COLD-PCR) is a sensitive assay for the detection of genetic mutations in solid tumours. This study assessed the feasibility of using COLD-PCR to screen for EGFR and KRAS mutations in cytology samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA in routine clinical practice. Samples obtained from NSCLC patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA were evaluated according to our standard clinical protocols. DNA extracted from these samples was subjected to COLD-PCR to amplify exons 18-21 of EGFR and exons two and three of KRAS followed by direct sequencing. Mutation analysis was performed in 131 of 132 (99.3%) NSCLC patients (70F/62M) with confirmed lymph node metastases (94/132 (71.2%) adenocarcinoma; 17/132 (12.8%) squamous cell; 2/132 (0.15%) large cell neuroendocrine; 1/132 (0.07%) large cell carcinoma; 18/132 (13.6%) NSCL-not otherwise specified (NOS)). Molecular analysis of all EGFR and KRAS target sequences was achieved in 126 of 132 (95.5%) and 130 of 132 (98.4%) of cases respectively. EGFR mutations were identified in 13 (10.5%) of fully evaluated cases (11 in adenocarcinoma and two in NSCLC-NOS) including two novel mutations. KRAS mutations were identified in 23 (17.5%) of fully analysed patient samples (18 adenocarcinoma and five NSCLC-NOS). We conclude that EBUS-TBNA of lymph nodes infiltrated by NSCLC can provide sufficient tumour material for EGFR and KRAS mutation analysis in most patients, and that COLD-PCR and sequencing is a robust screening assay for EGFR and KRAS mutation analysis in this clinical context."
https://openalex.org/W2056768333,"The species Saccharomyces cerevisiae includes natural strains, clinical isolates, and a large number of strains used in human activities. The aim of this work was to investigate how the adaptation to a broad range of ecological niches may have selectively shaped the yeast metabolic network to generate specific phenotypes. Using 72 S. cerevisiae strains collected from various sources, we provide, for the first time, a population-scale picture of the fermentative metabolic traits found in the S. cerevisiae species under wine making conditions. Considerable phenotypic variation was found suggesting that this yeast employs diverse metabolic strategies to face environmental constraints. Several groups of strains can be distinguished from the entire population on the basis of specific traits. Strains accustomed to growing in the presence of high sugar concentrations, such as wine yeasts and strains obtained from fruits, were able to achieve fermentation, whereas natural yeasts isolated from “poor-sugar” environments, such as oak trees or plants, were not. Commercial wine yeasts clearly appeared as a subset of vineyard isolates, and were mainly differentiated by their fermentative performances as well as their low acetate production. Overall, the emergence of the origin-dependent properties of the strains provides evidence for a phenotypic evolution driven by environmental constraints and/or human selection within S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1991490009,"This work examined the novel hypothesis that reduced levels of H(2)S or L-cysteine (LC) play a role in the impaired glucose metabolism seen in diabetes. 3T3L1 adipocytes were treated with high glucose (HG, 25 mM) in the presence or absence of LC or H(2)S. Both LC and H(2)S treatments caused an increase in phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3), AKT phosphorylation, and glucose utilization in HG-treated cells. The effect of LC on PIP3 and glucose utilization was prevented by propargylglycine, an inhibitor of cystathionine γ-lyase that catalyzes H(2)S formation from LC. This demonstrates that H(2)S mediates the effect of LC on increased PIP3 and glucose utilization. H(2)S and LC caused phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and PTEN inhibition. Treatment with LC, H(2)S, or PIP3 increased the phosphorylation of IRS1, AKT, and PKCζ/λ as well as GLUT4 activation and glucose utilization in HG-treated cells. This provides evidence that PIP3 is involved in the increased glucose utilization observed in cells supplemented with LC or H(2)S. Comparative signal silencing studies with siAKT2 or siPKCζ revealed that PKCζ phosphorylation is more effective for the GLUT4 activation and glucose utilization in LC-, H(2)S-, or PIP3-treated cells exposed to HG. This is the first report to demonstrate that H(2)S or LC can increase cellular levels of PIP3, a positive regulator of glucose metabolism. The PIP3 increase is mediated by PI3K activation and inhibition of PTEN but not of SHIP2. This study provides evidence for a molecular mechanism by which H(2)S or LC can up-regulate the insulin-signaling pathways essential for maintenance of glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2015126872,"Collapsin response mediator proteins are ubiquitously expressed from multiple genes (CRMPs 1–5) and play important roles in dividing cells and during semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) signaling. Nonetheless, their mode of action remains opaque. Here we carried out in vivo and in vitro assays that demonstrate that CRMPs are a new class of microtubule-associated protein (MAP). In experiments with CRMP1 or CRMP2 and their derivatives, only the C-terminal region (residues 490–572) mediated microtubule binding. The in vivo microtubule association of CRMPs was abolished by taxol or epothilone B, which is highly unusual. CRMP2-depleted cells exhibited destabilized anaphase astral microtubules and altered spindle position. In a cell-based assay, all CRMPs stabilized interphase microtubules against nocodazole-mediated depolymerization, with CRMP1 being the most potent. Remarkably, a 82-residue C-terminal region of CRMP1 or CRMP2, unrelated to other microtubule binding motifs, is sufficient to stabilize microtubules. In cells, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) inhibition potentiates this activity. Thus, CRMPs are a new class of MAP that binds through a unique motif, but in common with others such as Tau, is antagonized by GSK3β. This regulation is consistent with such kinases being critical for the Sema3A (collapsin) pathway. These findings have implications for cancer and neurodegeneration.

Sema3A is a chemo-repellant guidance protein, required in neural, cardiac, and peripheral vascular patterning. Class 3 semaphorins, which include Sema3A, are structurally conserved secreted proteins. Neuropilin-1/PlexinA holoreceptor transmits signals from Sema3A to affect multiple processes including axon and dendrite specification (7Erskine L. Reijntjes S. Pratt T. Denti L. Schwarz Q.

This involves the activation of various kinases including Rho-kinase (ROCK) and CDK5. It has wider effects in neurons; for example, Sema3A is one of the key molecules that prevent CNS remyelination following damage (9Piaton G. Aigrot M.S. Williams A. Moyon S. Tepavcevic V. Moutkine I.

In an adult murine demyelination model, Sema3A has been shown to impair oligodendrocyte precursor cell recruitment to the demyelinated area. Ischemic neurons can prevent vascular regeneration of neural tissue by secreting Sema3A (11Joyal J.S. Sitaras N. Binet F. Rivera J.C. Stahl A. Zaniolo K. Shao Z. Polosa A. Zhu T. Hamel D. Djavari M.

The way in which CRMPs might function in this pathway is thus of particular interest. collapsin response mediator protein CRMP C-terminal MT binding domain microtubule cyclin-dependent kinase 5 glycogen synthase kinase-3 Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase semaphorin 3A. Human CRMPs are encoded by five genes (CRMPs 1–5), which are alternatively spliced to yield shorter (∼65 kDa) and longer forms (∼80 kDa) containing N-terminal extensions (13Hamajima N. Matsuda K. Sakata S. Tamaki N. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Gene. 1996; 180: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6197-6207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRMPs likely exist as hetero-tetrameric complexes in vivo (1Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels being found in the brain (where microtubules are most abundant as well), particularly during development (14Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6197-6207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have identified CRMP function in neuronal maturation; in Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations of unc-33 (one of three CRMP genes) result in abnormal axonal guidance (15Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Thomson J.N. Perkins L.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 111: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), as with CRMP loss in mammals. CRMP1 knock-out mice also have defects in dendritic spine development, particularly in cortical layer V of the cerebral cortex (16Yamashita N. Morita A. Uchida Y. Nakamura F. Usui H. Ohshima T. Taniguchi M. Honnorat J. Thomasset N. Takei K. Takahashi T. Kolattukudy P. Goshima Y. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12546-12554Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CRMP3−/− mice have defective dendritic arborization and spine morphology (17Quach T.T. Massicotte G. Belin M.F. Honnorat J. Glasper E.R. Devries A.C. Jakeman L.B. Baudry M. Duchemin A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which have been ascribed to altered microtubule dynamics. In dividing cells such as neuroblastoma and lung cancer cells, antibodies directed to CRMP1 and CRMP2 stain the mitotic spindle and midzone structures (18Shih J.Y. Lee Y.C. Yang S.C. Hong T.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17917-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but whether this represents direct or indirect binding is unclear. Microtubules (MTs) are particularly important to drive and sustain neuronal morphology. Microtubules are well established as a target in cancer therapy, and drugs perturbing their physiological rate of turnover such as taxol are widely used in chemotherapy. Distinct classes of interacting proteins coordinate filamentous dynamics, including MT-associated proteins (MAPs, such as Tau), MT destabilizers such as stathmin, and the MT plus-end tracking proteins as reviewed (20Poulain F.E. Sobel A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2010; 43: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although CRMP2 has been reported to promote MT assembly in vitro (21Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Ménager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), this activity appeared to derive from the N-terminal dihydropyrimidinase-like domain. It was suggested that in neurons, CRMP2 binds soluble tubulin as part of a kinesin-1 dependent transport complex in the axon (22Kimura T. Watanabe H. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Sema3A-induced axonal growth cone collapse requires Cdk5 phosphorylation of CRMP2 Ser-522, which primes for GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-518, Thr-514, and Thr-509 (4Brown M. Jacobs T. Eickholt B.

Studies have also identified other phosphorylation events impinging on CRMP. The ROCK phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Thr-555, downstream of EphrinA5 or lysophosphatidic acid, participates in growth cone collapse in dorsal root ganglion neurons (24Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K.

Although Sema3A activates ROCK/myosin II, this is required for (secondary) axon retraction but not growth cone collapse (26Gallo G. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3413-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here we show that CRMP proteins bind to and stabilize MTs in vivo. CRMP1 and CRMP2 localize to mitotic MTs, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of CRMP2 depletes anaphase astral MTs and alters the position of the mitotic spindle relative to the cell periphery. The minimal MT binding region of CRMPs, determined by their in vivo association midzone MTs, is the C-terminal “tail” region of CRMP1 (conserved between the CRMPs). Expression of CRMP1/2 or the GST-C termini of CRMP1 or CRMP2 (82 amino acid residues) effectively stabilizes MTs against nocodazole-induced disassembly. Using this in vivo assay, we show that GSK3 negatively regulates this activity. In cells, CRMP binding to MTs is also blocked by MT-stabilizing drugs such as taxol and epothilone B. Thus, CRMP proteins bind to MTs in a way quite distinct from typical MAPs. Anti-HA (Y-11) and anti-β-actin (C4) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cells were typically used 48 h after transfection. pGEX4T1-CRMP1(491-572) or pGEX4T1-stathmin plasmid was transformed to Escherichia coli BL-21 and induced with 10 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C. Bacteria were harvested at 6,000 rpm (10 min at 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by adding 1 mg/ml lysozyme (4 °C, 30 min). The supernatant (13,500 rpm, 30 min at 4 °C) was added to glutathione-Sepharose (GenScript, 20 ml of lysate to 1 ml of beads) and washed with lysis buffer. The GST fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced l-glutathione (Sigma) and dialyzed against PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8). Protein concentration was measured using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). His6-CRMP1 and His6-Tau CT constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21.

Briefly, the bacteria pellet was resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Lysis was performed as above for pGEX constructs. The supernatant fractions containing His6-tagged proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's conditions. Recombinant His6-tagged proteins were eluted from the beads with 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed against PEM buffer. dsRNA transfected cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were spun in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein sample buffer was added into the supernatants and boiled before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All the protein samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in 0.05% Tween 20, PBS buffer for 30 min and incubated with primary and secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies diluted in 1% milk, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS buffer for 2 and 1 h, respectively, at room temperature. Purified tubulin was made up to 5 mg/ml in 10% glycerol-PEM buffer. The tubulin was preclarified by high speed centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C (100,000 × g, TL100 centrifuge, Beckman). The tubulin solution was polymerized at 37 °C for 30 min with 1 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor, 1 mm GTP, and the recombinant proteins (GST, His6-CRMP1, and His6-Tau at 0.2 mg/ml), with or without 10 μm taxol. The final tubulin concentration was 2 mg/ml. Microtubules were spun down at 65,000 rpm for 15 min at 25 °C. The pellets were washed with warm PEM buffer. The pellets and supernatants were diluted with SDS sample buffers and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. CM5 chips and HEPES-buffered saline were used for analyte (GE Healthcare) with a flow rate of 15 μl/min. A reference flow cell contained immobilized GST protein. Dialyzed recombinant GST CRMP1(491–572), His6-CRMP1, and GST-stathmin were precleared at 90,000 rpm, 10 min (TLA100, Beckman) before coupling to the CM5 chip, and unreacted sites were blocked with 0.1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Pure bovine tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) dissolved in PEM+T (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 6.8) was preclarified at 90,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The sensor chip was regenerated with 30 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. Traces were corrected with respect to the GST control sensorgram. COS7 cells were treated with 2 μm nocodazole for 45 min, and fixed in a stabilizing buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1% paraformaldehyde-PEM buffer) for 5 min, and transferred to 3% paraformaldehyde/PEM (10 min). To inhibit GSK3, cells were serum-starved for 3 h and treated with 20 mm LiCl or 20 mm NaCl for 2 h before adding nocodazole. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min and blocked with 1% FBS in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min and then blocked with 10% FBS/PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS and incubated with the cells at 32 °C and then washed with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. Secondary antibodies (anti-mouse/rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa Fluor-546; 1:500) were incubated and washed under similar conditions. Far-red phalloidin and Hoechst dye were added in during the secondary antibody incubation step. Cells were mounted and viewed by Zeiss Axioplan2, and images were collected on a CoolSNAP HQ (Roper Scientific) camera using a 63× 1.4 NA oil lens. Confocal imaging was performed using Olympus FluoView 1000 using a 60×/100× oil lens. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop and Image J. Deconvolution was performed using the Huygens professional software (Scientific Volume Imaging). CRMPs 1–5 are the products of five genes, some of which are highly expressed during neuronal development, but some of which are also ubiquitously expressed (27Byk T. Ozon S. Sobel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Shih J.Y. Yang S.C. Hong T.M. Yuan A. Chen J.J. Yu C.J. Chang Y.L. Lee Y.C. Peck K. Wu C.W. Yang P.C. J. Natl.

Neurobiol. 2003; 28: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), of which CRMP2 is the best studied as an essential mediator of growth cone collapse induced by Sema3A signaling (2Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 3Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRMP2 itself accumulates in growth cones and also promotes multiple axons when ectopically overexpressed (21Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Ménager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 31Nishimura T. Fukata Y. Kato K. Yamaguchi T. Matsuura Y. Kamiguchi H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CRMP2 is suggested to play this role through tubulin (dimer) transport along axons by binding to kinesin-1 (22Kimura T. Watanabe H. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This might allow proper MT assembly at the growth cone (22Kimura T. Watanabe H. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). CRMP1 and CRMP2 have been at the mitotic spindle and midzone MTs, but the biochemical basis for this localization has not been described (18Shih J.Y. Lee Y.C. Yang S.C. Hong T.M. Huang C.Y. Yang P.C. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2003; 20: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Gu Y. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17917-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To investigate further the relationship between endogenous CRMP family proteins and MTs in mitotic cells, we first examined CRMP isoforms 1–5 in several cell types using RT-PCR and then CRMP1- and CRMP2-specific antibodies. COS7 (monkey large-T transformed fibroblast line), mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, oligodendrocytic OLDN-93, and normal mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts all expressed CRMP2 (Fig. 1A). CRMP1 protein was not detected in the fibroblastic COS7 and NIH3T3 lines. All these cell lines express CRMP2 and CRMP4 mRNA at comparable levels; CRMP4 has recently been investigated in the context of cell mitosis (32Ong Tone S. Dayanandan B. Fournier A.E. Mandato C.A. PLoS One. 2010; 5e14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). OLDN-93 cells had the highest relative amounts of CRMP2 protein (Fig. 1A), facilitating staining of the endogenous CRMP2 by indirect immuno-fluorescence. Here CRMP2 was present in mitotic structures and in puncta along the mitotic spindle at metaphase and on the midzone MTs in late telophase (Fig. 1B). Exogenous HA-tagged CRMP1 was similarly localized on the mitotic spindle and midzone MTs in these cells (data not shown). CRMP2 puncta were also detected on astral MT (Fig. 1B, white arrows; anaphase). In summary, we find that both CRMP1 and CRMP2 proteins closely associate with mitotic structures that are enriched for MTs, suggesting that this is a general feature of CRMPs. The shorter ∼65-kDa isoforms of CRMP1 and CRMP2 are polypeptides of 572 residues (Fig. 2B). Structural analyses of CRMP2 (residues 13–490) reveal the secondary structure of the tetrameric dihydropyrimidinase-like domain, but not of the flexible C-terminal 82 residues (5Deo R.C. Schmidt E.F. Elhabazi A. Togashi H. Burley S.K. Strittmatter S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Stenmark P. Ogg D. Flodin S. Flores A. Kotenyova T. Nyman T. Nordlund P. Kursula P. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 906-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has been reported that central residues 323–381 within the dihydropyrimidinase domain function to promote MT assembly by binding to tubulin dimers (21Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Ménager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). However, HA-CRMP1(1–490) failed to bind to midzone MTs in vivo (Fig. 2, A and B), instead implicating the C-terminal region (residues 490–572) in this interaction. We generated a series of C-terminal truncated proteins to delineate the requirements in this region (Fig. 2B). Microtubule association tolerated the deletion of 12 C-terminal residues (i.e. CRMP1 1–560), but not the further deletion of 10 residues (CRMP1 1–550) (Fig. 2, A and B). The mitotic spindle allows proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division, a function targeted by a number of drugs that affect MT dynamics. It is assembled as an anti-parallel array of MTs with their “minus” ends fixed onto the centrosomes and their dynamic “plus” ends projecting toward the chromosomes. Because CRMPs were clearly localized to mitotic MT arrays, we reasoned that these proteins could contribute to their dynamics. In the course of this work, a new study showed that loss of CRMP4 disrupts chromosomal alignment and mitotic progression (32Ong Tone S. Dayanandan B. Fournier A.E. Mandato C.A. PLoS One. 2010; 5e14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We investigated siRNA-mediated knockdown of CRMP2 in OLDN-93 cells, in which it is abundantly expressed (Fig. 1A). After siRNA treatment (supplemental Fig. S1A), ∼60% of the cells showed no detectable CRMP2 by immuno-staining (data not shown), allowing us to pinpoint affected cells. Consistent with a cell cycle effect, we noted that cells without CRMP2 took more time to go through mitosis (from cell rounding to re-attachment, data not shown), although we did not observe an effect on chromosome attachment as reported for CRMP4 in HeLa cells (32Ong Tone S. Dayanandan B. Fournier A.E. Mandato C.A. PLoS One. 2010; 5e14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of CRMP2 knockdown, mitotic CRMP2-depleted OLDN-93 cells were stained for tubulin (α and γ), endogenous CRMP2, and F-actin (with phalloidin) (Fig. 3) In control OLDN-93 cells during anaphase, CRMP2 exhibited punctate staining around the area of the centrosome (stained for γ-tubulin, Fig. 3A) and along the elongating central MT spindle (stained for α-tubulin, Fig. 3B). In mitotic cells stained for α-tubulin, MTs that emanate from the spindle away from the plane of division, termed astral MTs, are detected (using deconvolution image analysis; Huygens Professional software). In CRMP2 knockdown cells, there was significant reduction in the density of astral MTs (Fig. 3B), and the spindle lies closer to the cortical cell membrane at anaphase (Fig. 3A and schematic in Fig. 3C). Quantification of this spindle pole-to-cortex distance, stained respectively with γ-tubulin antibody and phalloidin, revealed an ∼37% reduction in this distance in CRMP2 knockdown cells (mean = 1.25 μm) versus control cells (mean = 1.95 μm). There was also a diminished density of astral MTs (compare Fig. 3B, inset), which probably reflects a general effect on integrity of MT structures. A similar effect on the spindle pole-to-cortex distance was also observed in NIH3T3 cells with CRMP2 knockdown (data not shown) suggesting that this is a general role of CRMP2. Thus, CRMP2, perhaps in the context of hetero-dimers with CRMP1 or CRMP4 (1Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), promotes MT stabilization during mitosis, and this is manifested in knockdown cells as a reduction in astral MTs. This is also consistent with the need for CRMP4 in proper chromosomal alignment (32Ong Tone S. Dayanandan B. Fournier A.E. Mandato C.A. PLoS One. 2010; 5e14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Current models of CRMP function include an interaction with tubulin dimers to regulate their intracellular (axonal) transport (22Kimura T. Watanabe H. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or promote the"
https://openalex.org/W2011535910,"Platelets are central players in inflammation and are an important component of the innate immune response. The ability to visualize platelets within the live host is essential to understanding their role in these processes. Past approaches have involved adoptive transfer of labelled platelets, non-specific dyes, or the use of fluorescent antibodies to tag platelets in vivo. Often, these techniques result in either the activation of the platelet, or blockade of specific platelet receptors. In this report, we describe two new methods for intravital visualization of platelet biology, intravenous administration of labelled anti-CD49b, which labels all platelets, and CD41-YFP transgenic mice, in which a percentage of platelets express YFP. Both approaches label endogenous platelets and allow for their visualization using spinning-disk confocal fluorescent microscopy. Following LPS-induced inflammation, we were able to measure a significant increase in both the number and size of platelet aggregates observed within the vasculature of a number of different tissues. Real-time observation of these platelet aggregates reveals them to be large, dynamic structures that are continually expanding and sloughing-off into circulation. Using these techniques, we describe for the first time, platelet recruitment to, and behaviour within numerous tissues of the mouse, both under control conditions and following LPS induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2060529075,"The acute-phase response is an inflammatory process triggered mainly by the cytokine IL-6. Signaling of IL-6 is transduced by activation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), which rapidly induces the production of acute-phase proteins such as haptoglobin and fibrinogen. Another target of the IL-6/STAT3 signal transduction pathway is the microRNA cluster miR-17/92. Here, we investigated the interplay of miR-17/92 and STAT3 signaling and its impact on the acute-phase response in primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Employing a reporter gene system consisting of STAT3-sensitive promoter sequences, we show that the miR-17/92 cluster member miR-18a enhanced the transcriptional activity of STAT3. IL-6 stimulation experiments in miR-18a-overexpressing hepatocytes and HepG2 cells revealed an augmented acute-phase response indicated by increased expression and secretion of haptoglobin and fibrinogen. This effect was due, at least in part, to repression of PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT, 3), a repressor of STAT3 activity, which we identified as a novel direct target of miR-18a. Finally, we demonstrate that the expression of miR-17/92 in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells is modulated by IL-6.

Our data reveal, for the first time, a microRNA-mediated positive feedback loop of IL-6 signal transduction leading to an enhanced acute-phase response in human hepatocytes. Severe inflammation is observed in several conditions, including overwhelming infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock, and results in the activation of a signaling cascade that is commonly referred to as the acute-phase response. Acute-phase proteins are involved in a great variety of physiological and biochemical processes, including growth inhibition of microbes (e.g. complement factors), blood coagulation (e.g. fibrinogen), and binding of proteins (e.g. haptoglobin-mediated binding of hemoglobin) (1Gabay C. Kushner I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5080) Google Scholar). During inflammation, the production of plasma proteins by hepatocytes is altered either by increasing the levels of plasma proteins (positive acute-phase reaction) or by decreasing their levels (negative acute-phase reaction). IL-6 is one of the most important cytokines that orchestrates the hepatic production of acute-phase proteins (2Heinrich P.C. Castell J.V. Andus T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar). For signal transduction, IL-6 binds to a membrane-associated receptor complex, which subsequently leads to the phosphorylation of Tyr-705 of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) (3Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STAT3 is actively transported to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of IL-6 target genes such as the acute-phase genes haptoglobin (Hp) 2The abbreviations used are: HphaptoglobinFGGfibrinogen γ-chainmiRNAmicroRNA.

Several negative feedback loops antagonize the activation of STAT3 to avoid persistent downstream signaling and subsequent dysregulation in the production of acute-phase proteins. A well characterized feedback pathway includes the blocking of the phosphorylation of STAT proteins by the action of the cytokine-inducible family of SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) (6Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). haptoglobin fibrinogen γ-chain microRNA. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a novel class of short non-protein-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of their target genes in a post-transcriptional manner either by mRNA degradation or by translational repression (7Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29453) Google Scholar). The importance of miRNAs in the signal transduction of IL-6 has been highlighted by a recent study showing that miRNAs derived from the miRNA cluster miR-17/92 modulate STAT3 phosphorylation in multiple myeloma cells (8Pichiorri F. Suh S.S. Ladetto M. Kuehl M. Palumbo T. Drandi D. Taccioli C. Zanesi N. Alder H. Hagan J.P. Munker R. Volinia S. Boccadoro M. Garzon R. Palumbo A. Aqeilan R.I. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12885-12890Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar); moreover, Fort et al. (9Fort A. Borel C. Migliavacca E. Antonarakis S.E. Fish R.J. Neerman-Arbez M. Blood. 2010; 116: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) identified several miRNAs that are directly involved in the production of the acute-phase protein fibrinogen in human hepatoma (HuH-7) cells. The polycistronic miRNA cluster miR-17/92 codes for six mature miRNAs (miR-17-5p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a, and miR-92) and has primarily attracted attention for being frequently linked to cancer by exhibiting oncogenic activities mainly due to targeting tumor suppressor genes (10Xiao C.

The expression of miR-17/92 is regulated by a number of known transcription factors, including the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc (11O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2460) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we provided evidence that, upon stimulation with IL-6, the expression of miR-17/92 is directly regulated by STAT3, thus emphasizing a potential link between miR-17/92 and inflammatory processes (12Brock M. Trenkmann M. Gay R.E. Michel B.A. Gay S. Fischler M. Ulrich S. Speich R. Huber L.C. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that miR-17/92 might represent a key component in IL-6 signal transduction contributing to the regulation of the acute-phase response in hepatocytes. Because hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells have been extensively used to investigate the IL-6-induced expression of acute-phase proteins and thus provide an established model to study the acute-phase response (13Hou T. Ray S. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37091-37102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we used these cells in this study to address the role of miR-17/92 in the expression of acute-phase genes and to identify novel miR-17/92 targets in the IL-6 signaling cascade. In addition, the interaction between miR-17/92 and the acute-phase response was investigated in primary human hepatocytes to underscore the role of these miRNAs in a physiological setting. Our data reveal, for the first time, a miRNA-mediated positive feedback loop of IL-6 signal transduction leading to an enhanced acute-phase response in human hepatocytes. These are described in detail under supplemental “Materials and Methods.” HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary human hepatocytes were purchased from Lonza (Verviers, Belgium) and cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. For stimulation experiments, HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with IL-6 as indicated. Quantification of specific mRNA transcripts was performed by SYBR Green quantitative real-time PCR using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) with normalization to the expression of GAPDH. Mature miRNAs were detected by specific stem-loop primers according to Chen et al. (14Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar). Primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table S1. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT, 3) and anti-Hp (both from Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), anti-STAT3 (R&D Systems), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). Bands were detected with species-specific secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and quantified with AlphaImager software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). An 878-bp fragment of the Hp promoter containing two STAT3-binding sites and a 578-bp fragment of the FGG promoter containing one STAT3-binding site were each cloned into the firefly luciferase-based pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Dübendorf, Switzerland). The SV40 promoter of pRL-SV40 (Promega) was replaced with the promoter of GAPDH (1063 bp). The 3′-UTR of PIAS3 (924 bp) was cloned into the pGL3-Control vector (Promega). As a negative control, an antisense construct was used (15Kuhn D.E. Martin M.M. Feldman D.S. Terry Jr., A.V. Nuovo G.J. Elton T.S. Methods. 2008; 44: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), as well as a construct with the specifically mutated seed match for miR-18a. For promoter activity studies, HepG2 cells were transfected with pGL3-Basic-Hp or pGL3-Basic-FGG and pRL-GAPDH for normalization. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with IL-6 for 4 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and normalized to the activity of Renilla luciferase. For miRNA target validation, HEK293 cells were transfected with pGL3-Control-PIAS3–3′-UTR, pRL-SV40 for normalization, and precursor molecules (pre-miRNAs). After 24 h, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. HepG2 cells were transfected with 200 nm siRNAs (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) or 100 nm pre-miRNAs or anti-miRNA (Ambion/Applied Biosystems; pre-miR-18a, pre-miR-19a, pre-miR-20a, pre-miR-92a, or anti-miR-18a) using the cell line Nucleofector kit V (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) or Lipofectamine 2000. Following an incubation period of 48 or 72 h, cells were stimulated with IL-6 (20 ng/ml). To determine levels of Hp and fibrinogen in cell culture supernatants, we used commercially available ELISA kits (GenWay Biotech Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism software was used. To compare samples, Student's paired or unpaired t test was applied, and a p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All data are shown as means ± S.D. or as single raw data (primary hepatocytes). This study was dedicated to investigating the role of miR-17/92 in IL-6 signaling and acute-phase response. Recently, we demonstrated that STAT3 directly activates the transcription of miR-17/92 upon IL-6 stimulation in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (12Brock M. Trenkmann M. Gay R.E. Michel B.A. Gay S. Fischler M. Ulrich S. Speich R. Huber L.C. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether IL-6 enhances the expression of miR-17/92 in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes similarly, IL-6 stimulation experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, HepG2 cells were stimulated for 1 h with different amounts of IL-6 ranging from 5 to 100 ng/ml, and expression of the primary transcript of miR-17/92 (C13orf25) was assessed as described by O'Donnell et al. (11O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2460) Google Scholar). Treatment with the lowest dose of IL-6 led to a small but significant up-regulation of C13orf25 (1.19 ± 0.13-fold, p = 0.008) (Fig. 1A); the strongest induction of C13orf25 mRNA levels was found when stimulated with 50 ng/ml IL-6 (1.54 ± 0.41-fold, p = 0.012). Dose-dependent induction of two acute-phase genes (i.e. Hp and FGG) used as positive controls is shown in Fig. 1 (B and C, respectively). These data reflect the potential of IL-6 to efficiently stimulate the production of acute-phase genes in HepG2 cells. Next, we used primary hepatocytes to address the role of IL-6 and miR-17/92 in another experimental model of the acute-phase response. We thus measured the expression levels of three miRNAs derived from miR-17/92 (miR-18a, miR-19a, and miR-20a) 24 h after IL-6 treatment and found that the expression levels of these miRNAs were increased in both donors used in this study (Fig. 1D). Together with our previous findings (12Brock M. Trenkmann M. Gay R.E. Michel B.A. Gay S. Fischler M. Ulrich S. Speich R. Huber L.C. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), these data support a cell type-independent mechanism for the induction of miR-17/92 by IL-6. In further study, we investigated the functional consequence of enhanced expression of miR-17/92 in HepG2 cells, in particular the significance for IL-6 signaling and acute-phase response. We performed gain-of-function experiments by transfecting HepG2 cells with precursor molecules of miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, and miR-92a (representing the four functional miRNA families encoded by miR-17/92) and a mixture of all four. Successful overexpression of miRNAs was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (supplemental Fig. S1). The impact of each miRNA on the activity of STAT3 was measured employing a luciferase-based reporter gene system consisting of STAT3-sensitive promoter sequences of two selected acute-phase genes, i.e. Hp and FGG. In scrambled transfected cells, IL-6 increased the relative Hp promoter activity by 15.48 ± 4.51-fold compared with unstimulated scrambled transfected cells (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the increase in promoter activity upon stimulation with IL-6 was significantly more enhanced when HepG2 cells were transfected with miR-18a (26.40 ± 4.47-fold, p = 0.002), miR-20a (21.32 ± 3.04-fold, p = 0.032), or a mixture of all four miRNAs (24.4 ± 5.46-fold, p = 0.011). Similar results were obtained when the promoter activity of FGG in HepG2 cells was analyzed, showing a significantly enhanced IL-6 response after transfection of miR-18a, miR-20a, miR-92a, and the miR-18a/miR-19a/miR-20a/miR-92a mixture compared with scrambled transfection (Fig. 2B). To confirm the results of the reporter gene assay, the mRNA levels of both acute-phase genes in HepG2 cells were quantified. IL-6 stimulation for 4 h thus induced the expression of Hp by 4.43 ± 1-fold in scrambled transfected cells. Overexpression of miR-18a (6.31 ± 0.75-fold, p = 0.001), miR-20a (5.92 ± 1.17-fold, p = 0.005), miR-92a (5.9 ± 0.6-fold, p = 0.005), or the miRNA mixture (5.57 ± 1.09-fold, p = 0.046) significantly enhanced the induction of Hp transcripts (Fig. 2C). Quantification of FGG mRNA levels yielded a similar expression pattern (Fig. 2D). After 4 h of stimulation with IL-6, the expression of FGG was induced in miR-18a-transfected cells (3.89 ± 1.35-fold, p = 0.082) and miR-20a-transfected cells (3.64 ± 0.51-fold, p = 0.03) compared with scrambled transfection (2.86 ± 0.93-fold). Because miR-18a and miR-20a showed the most consistent and prominent effects in modulating the acute-phase response at the mRNA level, we assessed the secretion of fibrinogen and Hp into the supernatants of HepG2 cells stimulated with IL-6 for 8 or 24 h. Fibrinogen release from miR-18a-transfected cells collected 8 h after stimulation was significantly increased both in unstimulated cells (2170 ± 602 ng/ml, p = 0.018) and in IL-6-stimulated cells (2760 ± 702.6 ng/ml, p < 0.001) compared with scrambled transfection (unstimulated, 1669 ± 312.1 ng/ml; IL-6-stimulated, 2194 ± 556.3 ng/ml) (Fig. 3A). Enforced expression of miR-20a did not influence the release of fibrinogen either in IL-6 naive cells or under stimulated conditions. Similarly, after 24 h of IL-6 stimulation, miR-18a-overexpressing cells produced significantly more fibrinogen (4899 ± 253.2 versus 4017 ± 173.5 ng/ml in the scrambled control, p = 0.002) (Fig. 3A), whereas transfection of miR-20a failed to enhance the release of fibrinogen. The same supernatants were assessed for Hp protein release, and, again, we found that miR-18a overexpression increased the secretion of the acute-phase protein (Fig. 3B). In detail, miR-18a significantly enhanced Hp release after both 8 h (166.6 ± 41.46 ng/ml, p = 0.02) and 24 h (420.8 ± 11.43 ng/ml, p < 0.001) of IL-6 stimulation compared with scrambled transfected and IL-6-stimulated cells (139.9 ± 32.6 and 368.7 ± 5.25 ng/ml, respectively). Hp release in miR-20a-overexpressing cells remained unaffected. To confirm these findings, identical experiments were performed in primary hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the IL-6-induced release of fibrinogen after 24 h was more pronounced in hepatocytes transfected with precursor molecules of miR-18a compared with the scrambled control. Similarly, we found increased expression of Hp in miR-18a-overexpressing hepatocytes as indicated by Western blotting (Fig. 3D). The ELISA and Western blot experiments thus confirmed the potential of miR-18a (but not of miR-20a) to promote the expression and release of acute-phase proteins. Conversely, the loss-of-function experiments by antagonizing the expression of miR-18a led to a decreased acute-phase response in HepG2 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). The previous experiments revealed an enhanced hepatic acute-phase response upon overexpression of miR-18a. Because miRNAs have been implicated in the repression of gene expression, we speculated that miR-18a might target a negative regulator of IL-6 signaling. Utilizing a computational screening (TargetScan, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research) (16Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9835) Google Scholar), the 3′-UTR of PIAS3 was identified to contain a potential binding site for miR-18a. PIAS3 is endogenously expressed in HepG2 cells and specifically inhibits the DNA-binding activity of STAT3 (17Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). To investigate whether miR-18a influences PIAS3 expression, we measured the mRNA levels of PIAS3 in miR-18a-transfected HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 4A, miR-18a transfection significantly reduced the expression of PIAS3 mRNA in HepG2 cells (by 36 ± 7%, p < 0.001) and in hepatocytes from both donors. Consistent with these data, Western blot experiments showed reduced protein levels of PIAS3 in HepG2 cells transfected with pre-miR-18a (PIAS3/α-tubulin ratio, 0.52 ± 0.04 (scrambled transfection) and 0.35 ± 0.12 (pre-miR-18a transfection), p = 0.044) (Fig. 4B). To prove the specificity of the observed reduction of PIAS3, we additionally quantified PIAS3 protein expression in miR-20a-transfected cells. miR-20a, which was not predicted to target PIAS3, did not change the protein expression of PIAS3 (PIAS3/α-tubulin ratio, 0.53 ± 0.09, p = 0.773) (Fig. 4B), implying an efficient and specific down-regulation of PIAS3 by miR-18a. To address the question of whether the observed reduction in PIAS3 expression is directly miR-18a-driven, we performed reporter gene studies in HEK293 cells. The entire 3′-UTR of PIAS3 was cloned into the pGL3-Control vector, creating a luciferase reporter system with the respective seed sequence for miR-18a (Fig. 4D). As a negative control, the “antisense” construct was generated (15Kuhn D.E. Martin M.M. Feldman D.S. Terry Jr., A.V. Nuovo G.J. Elton T.S. Methods. 2008; 44: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In addition, we mutated the miR-18a seed match sequence in the “sense” construct by introducing four point mutations (3′-UTR of PIAS3ΔmiR-18a) (Fig. 4D). Cotransfection of the PIAS3 3′-UTR WT construct and pre-miR-18a yielded a significantly reduced relative luciferase activity (0.6 ± 0.07-fold, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4E). The antisense construct, as well as the mutant construct, was not affected by overexpression of miR-18a. These findings imply a direct interaction between the 3′-UTR of PIAS3 and miR-18a. So far, our data demonstrated that miR-18a promotes the acute-phase response and directly inhibits PIAS3, a known repressor of STAT3 activity. Due to the fact that the role of PIAS3 in the acute-phase response was still unknown and to mimic the effects of miR-18a, we silenced PIAS3 and, as an additional control, STAT3 in HepG2 cells. (mRNA levels were reduced by 32 ± 12 and 69 ± 6%, respectively (p < 0.001).) Next, we performed reporter gene studies to monitor the promoter activity of Hp and FGG in siRNA-transfected and IL-6-stimulated HepG2 cells. The IL-6-induced promoter activity of Hp was significantly reduced in STAT3-silenced cells (7.43 ± 2.01-fold, p < 0.001) compared with scrambled transfection (21.17 ± 3.55-fold) (Fig. 5A). Conversely, the response to IL-6 was increased when the expression of PIAS3 was silenced (28.15 ± 3.63-fold, p = 0.015). Promoter activity studies of FGG revealed a similar result showing a significant reduction (silencing of STAT3) and increase (silencing of PIAS3) of the IL-6 response in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5B). To support these findings further, the mRNA levels of Hp and FGG were measured after 4 h of IL-6 stimulation. Fig. 5C summarizes the quantification of Hp mRNA levels, showing an IL-6-induced up-regulation of Hp by 7.32 ± 1.41-fold in scrambled transfected cells. Transfection of STAT3 siRNA reduced the IL-6-induced stimulation of Hp mRNA expression (4.78 ± 0.44-fold, p < 0.001); in contrast, the expression of Hp was further increased when PIAS3 was silenced concomitantly (9.65 ± 2.15-fold, p = 0.015). A similar expression pattern was detected when the same samples were analyzed for the expression of FGG mRNA (Fig. 5D). The effect of miR-18a on the phosphorylation of STAT3 was tested by performing Western blot experiments. As shown in Fig. 6A, the IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was found to be more pronounced in pre-miR-18a-transfected HepG2 cells (STAT3-P/α-tubulin ratio, 0.84 ± 0.15 (scrambled transfection) and 1.17 ± 0.31 (pre-miR-18a transfection), p = 0.039) (Fig. 6B). Induction peaked 30 min after IL-6 stimulation, indicating enhanced activity of STAT3. In addition, the expression of STAT3 was increased at the protein level (STAT3/α-tubulin ratio, 0.62 ± 0.13 (scrambled transfection unstimulated) and 1.12 ± 0.26 (pre-miR-18a transfection unstimulated), p = 0.002) (Fig. 6C) and at the mRNA level (1.68 ± 0.18-fold, p < 0.001) (Fig. 6D) by pre-miR-18a transfection. Taken together, our data present a novel IL-6/miR-17/92 pathway that enhances the expression and release of the acute-phase proteins fibrinogen and Hp by promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and PIAS3 inhibition, thereby augmenting STAT3 activation. In this study, we have demonstrated a novel regulatory pathway of the acute-phase response. Briefly, we found that IL-6 stimulated the expression of the miRNA cluster miR-17/92 in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes, representing a novel positive feedback loop of IL-6 signaling through the repression of the STAT3 inhibitor PIAS3. Thus, overexpression of the miR-17/92-derived miR-18a enhanced the production of the acute-phase proteins fibrinogen and Hp, providing evidence for an important role of miRNAs in the regulation of the inflammatory response. To a substantial extent, the acute-phase response is controlled by the cytokine IL-6, which is released from monocytes and other immune cells during acute and chronic inflammatory disorders (18Gauldie J. Richards C. Harnish D. Lansdorp P. Baumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 7251-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). In the liver, the acute-phase response is initiated by the IL-6-induced phosphorylation and dimerization of the transcription factor STAT3, which subsequently shuttles to the nucleus (3Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). STAT3 homodimers bind to specific DNA sequences in promoter regions and stimulate the transcription of IL-6 target genes (19Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that, in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, STAT3 directly activates the transcription of miR-17/92 upon stimulation with IL-6 (12Brock M. Trenkmann M. Gay R.E. Michel B.A. Gay S. Fischler M. Ulrich S. Speich R. Huber L.C. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Here, analogous stimulation experiments with IL-6 in HepG2 cells revealed a dose-dependent up-regulation of the primary transcript of miR-17/92 (i.e. C13orf25). Together with our previous results (12Brock M. Trenkmann M. Gay R.E. Michel B.A. Gay S. Fischler M. Ulrich S. Speich R. Huber L.C. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), the induction of miR-17/92 by IL-6 thus appears to be a STAT3-mediated and cell type-independent mechanism. In this regard, we identified an evolutionarily conserved core palindromic TT-AA motif with a 4-bp spacing in the promoter of miR-17/92, which is responsible for STAT3 binding (12Brock M. Trenkmann M. Gay R.E. Michel B.A. Gay S. Fischler M. Ulrich S. Speich R. Huber L.C. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To maintain a physiological steady state under normal conditions, the function and expression of STAT3 need to be finely balanced, which is achieved mainly by the concerted action of intracellular feedback loops. We therefore hypothesized that the STAT3-regulated miR-17/92 cluster might be involved in the feedback signaling of STAT3 as well. We thus measured the promoter activity of the STAT3 target genes Hp and FGG in HepG2 cells transfected with miRNA mimics. Overexpression of miR-18a and miR-20a resulted in enhanced activation of STAT3 upon IL-6 stimulation as shown by promoter studies. These results were further confirmed by showing increased mRNA expression levels of Hp and FGG upon transfection of miR-18a and miR-20a, respectively. With respect to these findings we conclude that miR-17/92 acts as an enhancer of STAT3 activity and represents a positive feedback loop in the IL-6 signaling cascade. Interestingly, Pichiorri et al. (8Pichiorri F. Suh S.S. Ladetto M. Kuehl M. Palumbo T. Drandi D. Taccioli C. Zanesi N. Alder H. Hagan J.P. Munker R. Volinia S. Boccadoro M. Garzon R. Palumbo A. Aqeilan R.I. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12885-12890Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) demonstrated that another miRNA encoded by miR-17/92, miR-19a, augments STAT3 activity by targeting SOCS1, a known suppressor of STAT3 phosphorylation. In contrast to these findings, we did not observe increased IL-6 signaling in miR-19a-transfected HepG2 cells. These differences are probably due to the respective experimental settings: because SOCS1 is part of a negative feedback loop of STAT3 activity (6Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and thus exerts its function with temporal delay, the 4 h of IL-6 stimulation employed in our study might be too short to observe a miR-19a-mediated effect on STAT3 activity. Because miRNAs have been associated mainly with the repression of gene expression (7Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29453) Google Scholar), the observed up-regulation of acute-phase genes upon overexpression of miRNAs was most likely due to an indirect effect (i.e. the repression of a yet undefined inhibitor). A computational approach identified PIAS3, which interferes with the DNA-binding activity of STAT3 (17Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), to contain a potential binding site for miR-18a. Overexpression of miR-18a decreased the expression of PIAS3 at both the mRNA (probably due to mRNA cleavage) and protein levels. Furthermore, by performing reporter gene studies with the 3′-UTR of PIAS3, we confirmed a direct miR-18a-driven repression of PIAS3. We demonstrated the importance of PIAS3 for acute-phase response by showing that knockdown of PIAS3 led to enhanced activation of the promoters of FGG and Hp and thus increased expression of Hp and FGG mRNAs. The correlation between stimulation with IL-6 and expression of C13orf25 and PIAS3 was further investigated by kinetic experiments and revealed a down-regulation of PIAS3 after long-term stimulation (supplemental Fig. S3). To determine whether miR-18a also enhances the secretion of acute-phase proteins and to put our findings into a physiological context, we quantified the levels of Hp and fibrinogen in the supernatants of pre-miRNA-transfected HepG2 cells. We found the release of Hp and fibrinogen to be enhanced by miR-18a under both IL-6 naïve and IL-6-stimulated conditions. These findings emphasize the potency of miR-18a as a regulator of the acute-phase response via STAT3 signaling. Loss-of-function experiments by antagonizing miR-18a to inhibit STAT3 signaling were performed in HepG2 cells transfected with small antisense molecules directed against miR-18a (anti-miR-18a). These experiments showed reduced promoter activity and mRNA expression levels of FGG and Hp and decreased secretion of fibrinogen and Hp in anti-miR-18a-treated cells. On the other hand, the protein levels of PIAS3 were found to be up-regulated under these conditions. These data confirm the physiological role of miR-18a in the IL-6 signaling cascade and further demonstrate that silencing of miR-18a may provide a useful tool to interfere with the hepatic acute-phase response. The phosphorylation of Tyr-705 of STAT3 is an essential trigger of the acute-phase reaction and thus of special importance (3Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Here, we found that Tyr-705 was more phosphorylated in pre-miR-18a-transfected cells, indicating enhanced STAT3 activity. These findings support the conclusion that miR-18a acts as enhancer of the IL-6 pathway. Interestingly, the expression of STAT3 by pre-miR-18a transfection was found to be increased at both the mRNA and protein levels. Because the inhibitory action of PIAS3 affects the DNA-binding activity of STAT3, one might propose an additional, PIAS3-independent effect of miR-18a on Tyr-705 phosphorylation. Whether this effect is due to increased expression of the unphosphorylated STAT3 substrate remains unclear and needs to be addressed by further studies. In addition to miR-18a, the STAT3-dependent activation of the Hp and FGG promoters was significantly enhanced when HepG2 cells were transfected with precursor molecules of miR-20a. ELISAs for Hp and fibrinogen did not reveal, however, an elevated release of these proteins when miR-20a was overexpressed. Because two independent methods (reporter gene assay and quantitative real-time PCR) showed an increase in STAT3 activity by miR-20a, we suggest that the failure of increased acute-phase protein secretion by miR-20a might be due to an impaired protein release, or, alternatively, that miR-20a targets not only repressors but also activators of the IL-6 transduction pathway, e.g. JAK1 (Janus kinase 1). JAK1 is the kinase responsible for STAT3 phosphorylation and is also targeted by miR-20a (20Doebele C. Bonauer A. Fischer A. Scholz A. Reiss Y. Urbich C. Hofmann W.K. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Blood. 2010; 115: 4944-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The most important findings of this study were confirmed by performing experiments in an additional cell model using primary human hepatocytes. By overexpressing miR-18a in these cells, we could show that miR-18a augments the IL-6-induced acute-phase response by targeting the repressor of IL-6 signaling, PIAS3. Similarly, IL-6 treatment increased the expression of miRNAs derived from the miR-17/92 cluster, suggesting the presence of a positive feedback loop in both primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. In summary, we propose the following model for the regulation of the acute-phase response by miR-17/92 (Fig. 7). During states of acute or chronic inflammation, immune cells secrete IL-6, which causes the activation of STAT3 in hepatocytes. This triggers the production of acute-phase proteins and their systemic release. At the same time, the expression of miRNAs derived from the cluster miR-17/92 is up-regulated. This leads to a further augmentation of STAT3 activity through the repression of PIAS3 by miR-18a and finally contributes to the overwhelming release of acute-phase proteins. In conclusion, we identified here a novel IL-6/miR-17/92 pathway that, through the inhibition of PIAS3, enhances the production and release of the acute-phase proteins fibrinogen and Hp. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a miRNA-mediated regulation of PIAS3, thus contributing to the understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms within the signal transduction of IL-6.

Although YKL-40 expression is up-regulated in glioblastoma multiforme, its regulation and functions in nontransformed cells of the central nervous system are widely unexplored.

https://openalex.org/W2023900974,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant form of glioma with high mortality and no cure. Many human cancers maintain a complex inflammatory program triggering rapid recruitment of inflammatory cells, including mast cells (MCs), to the tumor site. However, the potential contribution of MCs in glioma has not been addressed previously. Here we report for the first time that MCs infiltrate KRas+Akt-induced gliomas, using the RCAS/TV-a system, where KRas and Akt are transduced by RCAS into the brains of neonatal Gtv-a- or Ntv-a transgenic mice lacking Ink4a or Arf. The most abundant MC infiltration was observed in high-grade gliomas of Arf−/− mice. MC accumulation could be localized to the vicinity of glioma-associated vessels but also within the tumor mass. Importantly, proliferating MCs were detected, suggesting that the MC accumulation was caused by local expansion of the MC population. In line with these findings, strong expression of stem cell factor (SCF), i.e. the main MC growth factor, was detected, in particular around tumor blood vessels. Further, glioma cells expressed the MC chemotaxin CXCL12 and MCs expressed the corresponding receptor, i.e. CXCR4, suggesting that MCs could be attracted to the tumor through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. Supporting a role for MCs in glioma, strong MC infiltration was detected in human glioma, where GBMs contained significantly higher MC numbers than grade II tumors did. Moreover, human GBMs were positive for CXCL12 and the infiltrating MCs were positive for CXCR4. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence for a role for MCs in glioma."
https://openalex.org/W1983036561,"Nuclear factor E2-related factor 1 (Nrf1) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that plays important roles in cellular stress response and development. Currently, the mechanism regulating Nrf1 expression is poorly understood. We report here that Nrf1 is a short-lived protein that is targeted by F-box protein Fbw7, which is the substrate-specifying component of SCF (Skp1-Cul1-Fbox protein-Rbx1)-type ubiquitin ligase for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We show that Fbw7 directly binds Nrf1 through a Cdc4 phosphodegron and that enforced expression of Fbw7 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf1. Conversely, depletion of endogenous Fbw7 leads to decreased Nrf1 ubiquitination and accumulation of Nrf1 protein. Accordingly, expression of Fbw7 leads to down-regulation of antioxidant response element-driven gene activation, whereas disruption of Fbw7-mediated destabilization of Nrf1 leads to increased antioxidant response element-driven gene expression. Together, these data identify Fbw7 as a regulator of Nrf1 expression and reveal a novel function of Fbw7 in cellular stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2071869790,"Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is a presynaptic protein essential for neurotransmitter release. Previously, we demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates Ser187 of SNAP-25, and enhances neurotransmitter release by recruiting secretory vesicles near to the plasma membrane. As PKC is abundant in the brain and SNAP-25 is essential for synaptic transmission, SNAP-25 phosphorylation is likely to play a crucial role in the central nervous system. We therefore generated a mutant mouse, substituting Ser187 of SNAP-25 with Ala using “knock-in” technology. The most striking effect of the mutation was observed in their behavior. The homozygous mutant mice froze readily in response to environmental change, and showed strong anxiety-related behavior in general activity and light and dark preference tests. In addition, the mutant mice sometimes exhibited spontaneously occurring convulsive seizures. Microdialysis measurements revealed that serotonin and dopamine release were markedly reduced in amygdala. These results clearly indicate that PKC-dependent SNAP-25 phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of emotional behavior as well as the suppression of epileptic seizures, and the lack of enhancement of monoamine release is one of the possible mechanisms underlying these defects."

The mouse ADAM9 prodomain (proA9; amino acids 24–204), expressed and characterized from Escherichia coli, is a competitive inhibitor of human ADAM9 catalytic/disintegrin domain with an overall inhibition constant of 280 ± 34 nm and high specificity toward ADAM9. In SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing amyloid precursor protein, proA9 treatment reduces the amount of endogenous ADAM10 enzyme in the medium while increasing membrane-bound ADAM10, as shown both by Western and activity assays with selective fluorescent peptide substrates using proteolytic activity matrix analysis. An increase in membrane-bound ADAM10 generates higher levels of soluble amyloid precursor protein α in the medium, whereas soluble amyloid precursor protein β levels are decreased, demonstrating that inhibition of ADAM9 increases α-secretase activity on the cell membrane. Quantification of physiological ADAM10 substrates by a proteomic approach revealed that substrates, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), HER2, osteoactivin, and CD40-ligand, are increased in the medium of BT474 breast tumor cells that were incubated with proA9, demonstrating that the regulation of ADAM10 by ADAM9 applies for many ADAM10 substrates. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ADAM10 activity is regulated by inhibition of ADAM9, and this regulation may be used to control shedding of amyloid precursor protein by enhancing α-secretase activity, a key regulatory step in the etiology of Alzheimer disease.

The refractive index variations across the lens are dependent on the distributions and concentrations of the varying protein classes. In this study, we present the first measurements of the refractive index in the in situ eye lens from five species using a specially constructed X-ray Talbot grating interferometer. The measurements have been conducted in two planes: the one containing the optic axis (the sagittal plane) and the plane orthogonal to this (the equatorial plane). The results show previously undetected discontinuities and fluctuations in the refractive index profile that vary in different species. These may be linked to growth processes and may be the first optical evidence of discrete developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W2139292321,"Colonization-competition tradeoffs have been shown to be important determinants of succession in plant and animal communities, but their role in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities is not well understood. To experimentally examine whether strong spore-based competitors remain dominant on plant root tips as competition shifts to mycelial-based interactions, we investigated the mycelial competitive interactions among three naturally co-occurring ECM species (Rhizopogon occidentalis, R. salebrosus, and Suillus pungens). Each species was grown alone and in all pair-wise combinations on P. muricata seedlings in experimental microcosms and culture assays. Competitive outcomes were assessed from ECM root tip colonization, soil mycelial abundance, and mycelial growth in culture. In the microcosm experiment, we observed a clear competitive hierarchy of R. salebrosus>R. occidentalis>S. pungens. Competitive effects were also apparent in the culture assays, however, no similar hierarchy was present. These results contrast with our previous findings from spore-based competition, suggesting that ECM competitive outcomes can be life-stage dependent. The differing competitive abilities observed here also showed general correspondence with patterns of ECM succession in Pinus muricata forests, indicating that competitive interactions may significantly influence temporal patterns of ECM community structure."

We provide the first direct evidence that binding of ATP drives the gates to an inward-facing conformation, in contrast to type I importers specific for maltose, molybdate, or methionine. Following ATP hydrolysis, the translocation gates restore to an apo-like conformation. In the presence of ATP, an excess of vitamin B12 promotes the reopening of the gates toward the periplasm and the dislodgment of BtuF from the transporter.

https://openalex.org/W2046766469,"The pyridine nucleotide cycle is a network of salvage and recycling routes maintaining homeostasis of NAD(P) cofactor pool in the cell. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) deamidase (EC 3.5.1.42), one of the key enzymes of the bacterial pyridine nucleotide cycle, was originally described in Enterobacteria, but the corresponding gene eluded identification for over 30 years. A genomics-based reconstruction of NAD metabolism across hundreds of bacterial species suggested that NMN deamidase reaction is the only possible way of nicotinamide salvage in the marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis. This prediction was verified via purification of native NMN deamidase from S. oneidensis followed by the identification of the respective gene, termed pncC. Enzymatic characterization of the PncC protein, as well as phenotype analysis of deletion mutants, confirmed its proposed biochemical and physiological function in S. oneidensis. Of the three PncC homologs present in Escherichia coli, NMN deamidase activity was confirmed only for the recombinant purified product of the ygaD gene. A comparative analysis at the level of sequence and three-dimensional structure, which is available for one of the PncC family member, shows no homology with any previously described amidohydrolases. Multiple alignment analysis of functional and nonfunctional PncC homologs, together with NMN docking experiments, allowed us to tentatively identify the active site area and conserved residues therein. An observed broad phylogenomic distribution of predicted functional PncCs in the bacterial kingdom is consistent with a possible role in detoxification of NMN, resulting from NAD utilization by DNA ligase."
https://openalex.org/W2062438924,"The family of vertebrate globins includes hemoglobin, myoglobin, and other O(2)-binding proteins of yet unclear functions. Among these, globin X is restricted to fish and amphibians. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) globin X is expressed at low levels in neurons of the central nervous system and appears to be associated with the sensory system. The protein harbors a unique N-terminal extension with putative N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation sites, suggesting membrane-association. Intracellular localization and transport of globin X was studied in 3T3 cells employing green fluorescence protein fusion constructs. Both myristoylation and palmitoylation sites are required for correct targeting and membrane localization of globin X. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a vertebrate globin has been identified as component of the cell membrane. Globin X has a hexacoordinate binding scheme and displays cooperative O(2) binding with a variable affinity (P(50)∼1.3-12.5 torr), depending on buffer conditions. A respiratory function of globin X is unlikely, but analogous to some prokaryotic membrane-globins it may either protect the lipids in cell membrane from oxidation or may act as a redox-sensing or signaling protein."

This could allow for both oocyte ranking and embryo preferences in IVF applications. The clinical importance of healthy oocyte development is evidenced by the impressive pregnancy rates seen with infertile women using assisted reproductive technology with oocytes from young, fertile donors. Oocytes from young women have lower rates of meiotic errors and aneuploidy, and although aneuploidy is the most common cause of developmental arrest, screening embryos for aneuploidy does not exclude all embryos of poor prognosis. Earlier studies have demonstrated that as the primary oocyte develops, it transcribes thousands of genes whose products are necessary for fertilization and early embryonic development. Prior to meiosis I, the germinal vesicle breaks down and transcriptional factors disengage from chromatin, rendering the cell transcriptionally silent (1Sun F. Fang H. Li R. Gao T. Zheng J. Chen X. Ying W. Sheng H.Z. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant as the human zygotic genome is not activated and does not transcribe its DNA for 2–3 days following fertilization (2Braude P. Bolton V. Moore S. Nature. 1988; 332: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 3Vassena R. Boué S. González-Roca E. Aran B. Auer H. Veiga A. Belmonte J.C. Development. 2011; 138: 3699-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the exact period during which an IVF clinician decides which embryo to transfer into the woman (4Centers for Disease Control Prevention, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology2008 Assisted Reproductive Technology Success Rates: National Summary and Fertility Clinic Reports. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Atlanta, GA2010Google Scholar, see especially Fig. 37). Therefore, mRNAs needed for fertilization and early embryonic development must be present in the oocyte in sufficient quantity or ratio before the first polar body is extruded and guide the majority of embryonic processes to day 3. Thus, the transcriptome of the oocyte may predict both oocyte quality and the early developmental potential of the embryo. The ability to measure oocyte gene expression without harming the oocyte may prove helpful to clinicians caring for patients using assisted reproductive technology. Biopsying the polar body would allow embryologists to test for functional control of gene expression in the oocyte resulting from mRNA transcription, turnover, and from epigenetic processes that depend on more complex determinants than having an appropriate number of chromosomes (5Biddle A.

The transcriptome of a polar body has never been reported, and a polar body biopsy involves its careful removal through microdissection. This procedure can be performed without damaging the sibling oocyte or developing embryo (8Verlinsky Y. Ginsberg N. Lifchez A. Valle J. Moise J. Strom C.M. Hum. Reprod. 1990; 5: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and with advances in oocyte vitrification (9Rienzi L. Romano S. Albricci L. Maggiulli R. Capalbo A. Baroni E. Colamaria S.

Here, we are the first to report the analysis of polar body transcriptomes from any organism and analyze its mRNA population with that of its sibling oocyte. in vitro fertilization polar body metaphase II microRNA whole transcriptome amplification. Human oocytes were collected from infertility patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF under standard clinical protocol. Germinal vesicle and MI staged oocytes that were not mature for a clinically indicated intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedure underwent in vitro maturation for 24 h and were used in the study if they extruded a polar body. Written consent was obtained from all patients to use discarded tissue and oocytes for research, and the study was approved by the institutional review board at Women & Infants Hospital. Briefly, patients underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, with either luteal down-regulation using a GnRH agonist, pituitary suppression using a GnRH antagonist, or a microdose lupron “flare protocol” consisting of daily lupron injections initiated in the follicular phase with gonadotropins. Oocytes were aspirated by ultrasound guided transvaginal oocyte retrieval 36 h after injection with recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin. Four hours after retrieval, all oocytes were mechanically stripped of cumulus cells. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection was performed in all oocytes with visible polar bodies. After injection of all MII oocytes, any remaining immature oocytes were cultured for 20–24 h in IVM media. Immature oocytes were examined the next day, and oocytes that extruded a polar body were used for our study. A total of 22 oocytes and sibling polar bodies were collected and individually processed in this study. All biopsies were performed at 200X magnification after mechanical zona drilling with a polar body biopsy needle (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN). Polar bodies were aspirated into a glass micropipette with an inner diameter of 20 μm. The polar body was then processed using the lysis buffer and DNase 1 from the Ambion Cells-to-Ct Direct kit (Life Sciences, Carlsbad, CA), followed by reverse transcription and whole transcriptome amplification using the whole transcriptome amplification (WTA)2 kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Sibling oocytes were transferred to an identical lysis solution and processed using the same protocol. The lysed specimens were stored on ice for no more than 2 h, whereas other oocytes were biopsied; the lysates were then processed according to the WTA2 protocol. Briefly, primers with a common ∼25 bp and a pseudo-random 9-bp sequence, designed to favor binding to mRNA over mitochondrial and ribosomal sequences, bound to RNA, and reverse transcription occurred. This reverse transcription reaction occurs at graduated temperatures over several extension phases, and a final volume of 25 μl was generated. The cDNA is then amplified using the common ∼25-bp sequence for 14 cycles in a final volume of 75 μl (see Fig. 1a). In an attempt to maximize cDNA yield, 10 μl of the amplified cDNA was added to 65 μl of amplification mix, and the contents underwent an additional 15 rounds of amplification specific for cDNA containing the WTA products. The second amplification was combined with the remainder of the first amplification step. The final concentration for all libraries was between 30 and 40 ng/μl as measured by QuBit (Invitrogen). Each individual oocyte and polar body were processed in separate reactions and for those samples that were pooled, 10 oocytes or polar bodies were pooled together in a common tube after the two rounds of WTA amplification. The 22 oocyte and sibling polar body pairs (44 cells) were split into two replicates of 10 pooled cells and two replicates of a single cells, for a total of eight samples, four oocyte samples, and four polar body samples. The cDNA resulting from two rounds of the WTA amplification yielded fragments between 100 and 300 bp in length. The cDNA was not subjected to any additional shearing, and libraries were prepared using the NEBNext DNA Sample Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) with adapters and PCR primers from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The standard protocol was used with starting material of no less than 1.5 μg of total cDNA with one slight modification. After the ligation of the adapters to the ends of the cDNA molecules, PCR amplification was performed without an intervening gel purification. After the PCR step, gel purification of the completed library was performed and a wide band of 200–450 bp was cut from the gel. The library concentration was determined by quantitative PCR (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA) and size by Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The samples were sequenced for 42 bp on a GAIIx (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) using a custom sequencing primer consisting of the 6 bp most 3′ of the Illumina sequencing primer fused to the WTA2 primer sequence (Fig. 1b). The raw sequences were mapped against the human genome (UCSC hg18) using Illumina software, Casava (version 1.7) using 32 bp of the read and allowing only two mismatches. The raw gene counts were then loaded into edgeR (21Robinson M.D. McCarthy D.J. Smyth G.K. Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (21906) Google Scholar), which normalized the counts using the TMM method (trimmed mean of M values) (22Robinson M.D. Oshlack A. Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (4238) Google Scholar), and these counts were used for all further analyses. The geometric means of the TMM counts of every gene for all oocyte or polar body samples was used to generate a list of the expression levels of all genes. The R package ranked list comparison (23Antosh M. Fox D. Helfand S.L. Cooper L.N. Neretti N. Aging. 2011; 3: 576-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the expression level lists. We analyzed the transcriptomes of 22 oocytes alongside their 22 polar body siblings by high-throughput DNA sequencing. The samples were grouped into two biological replicates of 10 oocytes and their sibling polar bodies and two biological replicates of single oocytes and their single polar bodies. We developed a method for quantitative cDNA construction from both a single oocyte and its sibling polar body, and we detected a total of 12,883 genes through mapping of >27 million reads from these oocytes and polar bodies (Table 1). From this result, we estimate that between 14,000–15,000 genes are expressed in the human oocyte (supplemental Fig. 1). The genes that were expressed in each oocyte highly correlated with those that were expressed in other oocytes. Of the 7,523 genes detected in the smallest oocyte sample, 84.5% of the genes were detected in all four oocyte samples and >98% were detected in at least two samples (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, of the four oocyte/polar body pairs in this study, >90% of all the genes detected in a polar body sample were also detected in the sibling oocyte sample (Fig. 2b). This result might be expected because the polar body and oocyte shared a common ooplasm no more than 24 h prior to polar body biopsy, but no less surprising because of the diversity of the transcripts detected in the polar body samples. Comparing the overlap of each sibling oocyte/polar body pair with every other pair reveals that 279 genes (28.0% of genes detected in the smallest overlap pool) are expressed in all four paired samples (Fig. 2c and supplemental Table 1); 962 genes were detected in both the oocyte and sibling polar body samples in at least three of the four pairs (Fig. 2c).TABLE 122 oocytes and sibling PBs were divided into eight sequencing reactionsSequencing reactionsNo. of mappable readsNo. of genes foundPool of 10 oocytes 15,363,8029,765Pool of 10 oocytes 21,731,5137,523Pool of 10 polar bodies 1326,1761,053Pool of 10 polar bodies 2207,3032,224Single oocyte 13,692,1688,681Single oocyte 214,573,56711,881Single polar body 1904,1032,293Single polar body 2376,4413,515Total of all oocyte samples25,361,05012,708Total of all polar body samples1,814,0235,431Total of all samples27,175,07312,883 Open table in a new tab Although the sample to sample overlap of genes was very high in all examined comparisons, a critical component of the analysis was testing the abundance of those genes products. We performed a pairwise comparison of each oocyte sample and tested the levels of all gene products shared between each oocyte pair. The expression level of any gene in any oocyte sample correlated very strongly (Pearson correlation > 0.88) with the expression level in any other oocyte (supplemental Fig. 2). One hypothesis is that the polar body is a depository of the oocyte, that transcripts or cellular contents no longer needed or undesirable in the oocyte are transported to the polar body. We tested this hypothesis by doing a differential gene enrichment analysis of all oocyte samples against all polar body samples and found no genes that were differentially enriched between the two populations at any levels of significance (supplemental Fig. 3). Multiple normalization methods were used in this testing, and all results arrived at the same conclusion: the transcriptome of the polar body accurately reflects its sibling oocyte. The observation that transcript abundance is very similar between oocytes and polar bodies for all detected genes strongly argues against the interpretation that messages are selectively transported into or out of the polar body. A more parsimonious explanation is that as the polar body is extruded, it captures a representative portion of the ooplasm and therefore a representative transcriptome. Furthermore, no genes were sampled in all four polar body samples without being detected in a single oocyte, further evidence that specific transcripts are not localized to the site of the budding polar body and that the polar body inherits the general transcriptionally silenced state of the oocyte (1Sun F. Fang H. Li R. Gao T. Zheng J. Chen X. Ying W. Sheng H.Z. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results support the interpretation that the transcriptome of one oocyte is very similar to that of another oocyte in both the genes expressed and the expression levels and that the transcriptome of a polar body is directly representative of the transcriptome of its sibling oocyte. We took particular care to examine the data using the WTA procedure coupled with Illumina sequencing. A potential concern was that of amplification bias, but a formal test using the Ambion Cells-to-Ct kit and quantitative PCR, which has been previously tested to linearly amplify transcripts (10Klatsky P.C. Wessel G.M. Carson S.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2010; 16: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), would have been prohibitively costly. However, the relative rank abundance of half a dozen previously reported transcripts (10Klatsky P.C. Wessel G.M. Carson S.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2010; 16: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was recapitulated in this study using the WTA method. A second concern was the introduction of contaminants or the amplification of PCR mutations due especially to the two rounds of amplification in this study, potentially leading to mapping error. To control for this variable, we examined the number of reads that mapped to genes on the Y chromosome; because this study was conducted on oocytes and polar bodies that had never been exposed to sperm, there is no biological template for Y chromosome genes. Of the >27 million reads in this study, only 128 reads (<5 × 10−4% of the total reads) mapped to two genes found on the Y chromosome (USP9Y and DDX3Y), both of which have paralogs on the X chromosome (USP9X and DDX3X). The percent identity for the two sets of paralogs are very high (USP9 = 88.3% and DDX3 = 88.8%); therefore, Y chromosome mapping could be due to sequencing errors or statistical mapping error. The third and final concern was the recovery of sufficient material from a single oocyte, much less from a single polar body. To address this, we used two different types of samples: pooled and single specimens. We felt that the pooled specimens would decrease the oocyte to oocyte variability in gene expression and ensure that the cDNA would not be limiting. The single specimens would serve as a test of the clinical feasibility of reliably detecting transcripts in single cells as well as testing the variability of oocyte to oocyte differences in transcript abundance. We used the bioinformatics package DAVID (11Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (25869) Google Scholar) to test whether the genes that were detected in all oocyte samples completed specific enzymatic pathways. Of all of the detected genes in the oocyte samples, several dozen KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways were significantly complete, including “oocyte meiosis” (p value = 4.5 e−7) and “Progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation” (p value = 3.6 e−4) (supplemental Fig. 4), providing additional evidence that the transcriptome we are detecting are representative of oocytes. Intriguingly, a number of miRNAs in oocytes and polar bodies were detected, some of which are very abundant. Previous reports suggest that the miRNA pathway is non-functional in mouse oocytes (12Ma J. Flemr M. Stein P. Berninger P. Malik R. Zavolan M. Svoboda P. Schultz R.M. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 265-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Suh N. Baehner L. Moltzahn F. Melton C. Shenoy A. Chen J. Blelloch R. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 271-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and because our sequencing technique would have missed mature miRNAs, we hypothesize that the high abundance of miRNAs is due to the presence of pre-processed miRNAs. The down-regulation of the miRNA pathway may be due to the repression of Drosha/DGCR8, which would allow preprocessed hairpins to accumulate. This hypothesis is supported in part by the observation that the transcriptome of the mouse oocyte is minimally impacted by the loss of zygotic DGCR8 during early development (13Suh N. Baehner L. Moltzahn F. Melton C. Shenoy A. Chen J. Blelloch R. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 271-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). An abundance of preprocessed miRNA-containing transcripts in the nucleus could explain the slightly higher abundance (statistically non-significant) of miRNA genes in the polar body compared with the oocyte. The transcriptome of the polar body may be enriched for mRNAs that associate with the meiotic spindle. Because the polar body is significantly smaller than the oocyte, it may be unduly enriched for such transcripts. We also report that the abundance of some transcripts may vary significantly between single cells. The most notable example was the transcript level of the Anthrax receptor, ANTXR2, which varied in expression between the two single oocytes by 4 orders of magnitude. Remarkably, this difference in abundance was also reflected in the sister polar body by the same 4 orders of magnitude difference. Previous literature has shown ANTXR2 to be detected in oocytes (14Gr⊘ndahl M.L. Yding Andersen C. Bogstad J. Nielsen F.C. Meinertz H. Borup R. Hum. Reprod. 2010; 25: 957-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and significantly down-regulated (15Kocabas A.M. Crosby J. Ross P.J. Otu H.H. Beyhan Z. Can H. Tam W.L. Rosa G.J. Halgren R.G.

Such variation may reflect atypical regulation resulting from differences in the oocyte genome, differences in nutritional status of the oocyte, of donor age, and/or environmental influences on the oocyte. For successful transition into a clinical application using this approach, it is important to identify a cohort of transcripts that are reliably detected, whose expression levels are predictive of the developmental competence of a given oocyte and its resulting embryo. To develop a list of candidate transcripts for future studies, we generated a separate rank order list of the transcript abundance for oocytes and for polar bodies by taking the geometric means of the TMM-normalized gene counts in all four samples. The two separate lists were then compared with each other in discrete subsets to test the degree of overlap between the two lists within each independent subset. In the subset of the 50 most abundant genes in oocytes and polar bodies, 39 genes are shared between the two lists within that subset (p value = 1.23 e−74 when compared with a randomly ordered list). Of the 100 most abundant genes detected in all four oocyte samples, 72 were detected in all four polar body samples, and 61 of those were in the top 100 most abundant genes in polar bodies. In total, the 700 most abundant genes in each list constitute the significant overlap between the oocyte and polar body samples (combined p value = 6.16 e−250) and within the 700 genes, 460 genes are shared between the oocyte and polar body lists (Fig. 3). Nearly half of the 460 shared genes (215 genes) were detected in all oocyte and polar body samples (Fig. 2c and supplemental Table 1). Analysis of our data set strongly suggests that the polar body captures a representative transcriptome of the oocyte and that the transcriptomes of both single oocytes and single polar bodies can be assessed quantitatively. Although several microarray studies of human oocytes have been reported (14Gr⊘ndahl M.L. Yding Andersen C. Bogstad J. Nielsen F.C. Meinertz H. Borup R. Hum.

We compared our sequencing data set to that of three microarray studies to validate our findings (14Gr⊘ndahl M.L. Yding Andersen C. Bogstad J. Nielsen F.C. Meinertz H. Borup R. Hum.

Those genes that were most highly enriched in oocytes compared with the reference in microarray studies were more likely to be the same genes that were most abundant in our dataset (Fig. 4). Additionally, the genes reported to be significantly enriched in the reference compared with the oocytes were more likely to be genes detected at very low abundance in our oocyte data set. The total number of genes detected in polar bodies was highly variable between each sibling pair of oocytes and polar bodies, but the genes most abundant in oocytes were much more likely to be detected in one or more polar body samples. Furthermore, genes that were previously reported to be detected in oocytes and polar bodies by quantitative PCR (10Klatsky P.C. Wessel G.M. Carson S.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2010; 16: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were present in the same rank abundance in this study. One potential concern we had for biopsying the polar body was the fear that instead of sequencing the transcriptome of the polar body, we would contaminate the sample with a cumulus cell or other accessory cell. Comparing our data to that of a microarray study of human oocytes and cumulus cells, the polar body transcriptome is distinct from cumulus cells and instead very closely aligns with oocyte samples (Fig. 4). We demonstrated that detection and quantification of mRNA in polar bodies is possible and reflects the transcript profile of the MII oocyte. The quantification of mRNAs is of particular importance, and we also report that some transcripts can have highly variable expression in different oocytes and that this variance can be reflected in the polar body. This variance may reflect many factors seen by the oocyte during its development including nutritional status and environmental insults to the oocyte. Genes with higher levels of expression in oocytes are more reliably detectable in the sibling polar body, suggesting that a failure to identify a particular mRNA in the polar body relates to transcript levels within the oocyte that fall below a critical threshold. This finding is consistent with our previous results in both human and sea star oocytes (10Klatsky P.C. Wessel G.M. Carson S.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2010; 16: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Klatsky P.C. Carson S.A. Wessel G.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2010; 77: 386Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the detection and analysis of polar body mRNA may provide insight into oocyte quality, a critical metric needed by the clinical before fertilization and transfer of the resulting embryo back into the women."

We generated five variants of the human mtSSB bearing mutations in amino acid residues specific to metazoans that map on the protein surface, removed from the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding groove. Although the mtSSB variants bound ssDNA with only slightly different affinities, they exhibited distinct capacities to stimulate the DNA polymerase activity of human pol γ and the DNA unwinding activity of human mtDNA helicase in vitro. Interestingly, we observed that the variants with defects in stimulating pol γ had unaltered capacities to stimulate the mtDNA helicase; at the same time, variants showing reduced stimulation of the mtDNA helicase activity promoted DNA synthesis by pol γ similarly to the wild-type mtSSB. The overexpression of the equivalent variants of Drosophila melanogaster mtSSB in S2 cells in culture caused mtDNA depletion under conditions of mitochondrial homeostasis. Furthermore, we observed more severe reduction of mtDNA copy number upon expression of these proteins during recovery from treatment with ethidium bromide, when mtDNA replication is stimulated in vivo. Our findings suggest that mtSSB uses distinct structural elements to interact functionally with its mtDNA replisome partners and to promote proper mtDNA replication in animal cells.

In addition, human mtSSB (HsmtSSB) stimulates strand-displacement DNA synthesis promoted by the combined action of the human pol γ (Hspol γ) and HsmtDNA helicase (2Korhonen J.A. Pham X.H.

Although mtSSB mutations have not thus far been documented in association with human diseases, as is the case for the genes encoding pol γ and mtDNA helicase, a recent report shows a correlation between the levels of mtSSB protein, mtDNA copy number and the aggressiveness of human osteosarcoma cells, suggesting a link between mtDNA replication and cancer progression (9Shapovalov Y.

To date, mutagenesis studies of mtSSB have focused largely on biochemical and physiological properties of amino acid residues involved in tetramerization and/or ssDNA binding affinities. Li and Williams (10Li K. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8686-8694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of highly conserved residues among tetrameric SSBs for protomer-protomer interactions in the mouse mtSSB, including H69 (H69, HsmtSSB; H64, DmmtSSB (fly)), and for ssDNA binding, including W49, W68, and F74 (W49, W68 and F74, HsmtSSB; Y50, W63, and F69, DmmtSSB). DmmtSSB variants bearing W63A and/or F69A substitutions were defective in DNA binding in vitro as predicted, and the corresponding mutant genes promoted mtDNA depletion when expressed in Drosophila S2 cells in culture (6Farr C.L.

Interestingly, these proteins were also defective in stimulating the DNA polymerase activity of Drosophila pol γ (Dmpol γ). The homologous residues in the prototypical tetrameric SSB from Escherichia coli (EcSSB) have been implicated in similar functions (11Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1616-1626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 13Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), in keeping with the high degree of conservation between bacterial and mitochondrial SSBs. We sought to investigate properties that are specific to animal mtSSBs in the context of mtDNA replication by targeting amino acid residues that are well-conserved across animal species, but differ from those in EcSSB. Unlike mtSSBs, the catalytic subunit of pol γ and the mtDNA helicase share a common ancestry with the bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase and primase-helicase enzymes, respectively (14Shutt T.E. Gray M.W. Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 90-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This raises the interesting question of how the bacterial-like mtSSB has evolved to function in concert with the T7-like pol γ and mtDNA helicase in the mtDNA replisome. In an earlier study, we explored biochemically the capacity of terminal deletion variants of HsmtSSB to bind ssDNA and stimulate Hspol γ and HsmtDNA helicase (4Oliveira M.T. Kaguni L.S. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15379Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We determined that the absence of the termini was not deleterious and in fact, the stimulation of Hspol γ was higher in the presence of the variants than with wild-type HsmtSSB. In the present report, we describe biochemical and physiological studies of additional mtSSB variants carrying amino acid substitutions or deletions in residues that map outside of the DNA binding groove, mostly in loop regions on the surface of the protein (Fig. 1). Our findings provide insight into how mtSSB coordinates the functions of pol γ and mtDNA helicase and participates in the formation of the mtDNA replisome, a multi-protein complex in which defects caused by genetic mutations can culminate in aging, and in a variety of human diseases (15Spelbrink J.N.

The dsRNA used for knockdown of endogenous DmmtSSB (DmmtSSBendo) in S2 cells was produced in vitro using MEGAscript® T7 kit (Ambion), according to manufacturer's specifications. The DNA used as template in the reaction to produce the dsRNA was generated via PCR with the following primers: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAATTTAAGCCCAGATCAC-3′ and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATGGAGTACGACTACGCATG-3′, where the underlined sequences represent the minimal promoter needed for T7 RNA polymerase transcription initiation.

Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 36 fmol 5′-end-labeled 48-mer, and the indicated amounts of the HsmtSSB proteins. Incubation was at 20 °C for 10 min. Samples were processed and electrophoresed in 6% native polyacrylamide gels. The amounts of shifted and free oligonucleotide were quantitated as follows: % ssDNA bound = (VS/(VS + VF)) x 100, where VS represents the volume of the shifted and VF the volume of unshifted oligonucleotide in the sample lane of interest. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm DTT, 4 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl, 0.4 nm of DNA unwinding substrate, 3.5 nm of mtDNA helicase (as hexamer), and the indicated concentrations of HsmtSSB proteins. The reactions were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of the helicase. Once the helicase was added, the reactions were incubated further at 37 °C for 30 min and then stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 10× stop solution (6% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), followed by 5 μl of 10× loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue). DNA products were fractionated from substrate by electrophoresis in a 22% polyacrylamide gel (59:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) using 1× TBE (90 mm Tris-HCl-borate, 2 mm EDTA) at 600 V for ∼30 min. After electrophoresis, the gel was processed and the unwinding activity was quantitated as described in Oliveira and Kaguni (4Oliveira M.T. Kaguni L.S.

Incubation was at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were processed, and nucleotide incorporation was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter. Drosophila Schneider S2 cells were cultured at 25 °C in Drosophila Schneider medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). For establishment of stable lines, ∼1.2 × 107 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pMt/Hy vector carrying DmmtSSBwt or variant genes using the Effectene kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer's specifications. Hygromycin-resistant cells were selected with 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin for at least 5 passages, before transfer to standard growth medium. For knockdown of endogenous DmmtSSB protein, 3 μg of dsRNA (representing the 3′-UTR of DmmtSSBendo mRNA) were delivered to 3 × 106 cells using the Effectene kit. Cells were cultured for 3 days before reduction in levels of DmmtSSBendo protein was observed. In the experiments with EtBr, cells were treated with 0.2 μg of EtBr per ml of growth medium 3 days prior to treatment with dsRNA. For induction of expression of DmmtSSB variants, cells treated with dsRNA for 3 days were subjected to the indicated concentrations of CuSO4 to promote appropriate expression from the metallothionein promoter (22Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). For DmmtSSB detection, total protein extracts from S2 cells were separated in 17% SDS-polyacrylamide gels following standard laboratory methods. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA83, Whatman), which were preincubated for 1 h with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), followed by incubation of 1 h with DmmtSSB antibody (1:8000 dilution in TBST/1% milk). The membranes were washed several times with TBST for 1.5 h, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:16000 dilution in TBST/1% milk, Bio-Rad) for 1 h, and washed again several times with TBST for 1.5 h. DmmtSSB bands were visualized using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For β-tubulin detection, a similar procedure was performed, except that protein extracts were run on 12% SDS-polycrylamide gels and the antibodies used were E7 supernatant (1:50 dilution in TBST/1% milk, DSHB, University of Iowa) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000 dilution in TBST/1% milk, Bio-Rad). β-tubulin bands were visualized using alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2) containing 330 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 165 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Total DNA was extracted from S2 cells using phenol/chloroform protocol and standard laboratory procedures. mtDNA copy number was determined by quantification of relative amounts of mtDNA to nuclear DNA via real time amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial 16 S gene (primers: 5′-AAAAAGATTGCGACCTCGAT-3′ and 5′-AAACCAACCTGGCTTACACC-3′) and the nuclear RpL32 gene (primers: 5′-AGGCCCAAGATCGTGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-TGTGCACCAGGAACTTCTTGAA-3′). Reactions were performed using SYBR® Green JumpStartTM Taq ReadyMixTM (Sigma-Aldrich) on a 7500 Real Time PCR System instrument (Applied Biosystems), according to manufacturer's specifications. To construct the model of HsmtSSB bound to ssDNA, the crystal structure of HsmtSSB (PDB code 3ULL (23Yang C. Curth U. Urbanke C. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)) was aligned to the structure of EcSSB bound to ssDNA (PDB code 1EYG (13Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar)) using PyMol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3, Schrödinger, LLC). The atomic coordinates of EcSSB were then removed, allowing placement of the ssDNA in the DNA binding groove of HsmtSSB without major atomic collisions. To construct the model of the Hspol γ-HsmtSSB interaction, the regions of HsmtSSB that are disordered in the crystal structure (E1-V9, N terminus; S54-L59, loop 2,3; and D126-E132, C terminus; PDB code 3ULL (23Yang C. Curth U. Urbanke C. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)) were first modeled using MODELLER (24Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) at default parameters. The tetrameric HsmtSSB structure containing the modeled termini and loop 2,3 was submitted to the software ClusPro 2.0 (25Kozakov D. Hall D.R. Beglov D. Brenke R. Comeau S.R. Shen Y. Li K. Zheng J. Vakili P. Paschalidis I. Vajda S. Proteins. 2010; 78: 3124-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) for docking onto the crystal structure of the Hspol γ holoenzyme (PDB code 3IKM (26Lee Y.S. Kennedy W.D. Yin Y.W. Cell. 2009; 139: 312-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)) at default parameters. All of the figures were generated and the model was analyzed using the software PyMol. We selected candidate regions of the mtSSB protein for mutagenesis based on the assumption that residues important for functional and/or physical interactions with pol γ and mtDNA helicase would be well conserved among animal mtSSB sequences, and also locate on the surface of the protein structure. We avoided residues conserved between mtSSBs and EcSSB, because of their essential roles in the stabilization of the tertiary/quaternary structure of the protein and/or in contacting DNA directly; disrupting such properties would be expected to cause indirect effects on the ability of the protein to stimulate its mtDNA replisome partners (6Farr C.L. Matsushima Y. Lagina 3rd, A.T. Luo N. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17047-17053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The selected residues and an evaluation of their locations in a molecular model of HsmtSSB bound to ssDNA that indicates none of them are likely to interact directly with ssDNA are shown in Fig. 1. We expressed and purified to near-homogeneity recombinant wild-type HsmtSSB (HsmtSSBwt), and proteins bearing double- or triple-alanine substitutions mapping in loop 1,2 (E33A/G34A/K35A, HsmtSSBloop12), in α-helix 1 (Y83A/Q84A, HsmtSSBα1), and in loop 4,5 (Y100A/G101A/E102A, HsmtSSBloop45–1; and K106A/N107A/N108A, HsmtSSBloop45–2), or a deletion in loop 2,3 (S51-L59, HsmtSSBloop23)(supplemental Fig. S1). Velocity sedimentation indicated that all the variant HsmtSSB proteins retain their homotetrameric state (S values = 4.3; supplemental Fig. S2), whereas their ssDNA-binding affinities, as analyzed by gel mobility shift assays (GMSA), varied slightly (Fig. 2A). The variants HsmtSSBloop12 (Kd = 2.9 nm) and HsmtSSBloop23 (Kd = 2.4 nm) bound to ssDNA with affinities 1.3- and 1.6-fold higher than that of HsmtSSBwt (Kd = 3.8 nm), respectively; the affinities of the three other variants (α1: Kd = 3.8 nm; loop45–1: Kd = 4.1 nm; loop45–2: Kd = 3.7 nm) did not differ substantially from that of HsmtSSBwt, consistent with the model presented in Fig. 1C. At the same time, no significant variations were observed in the gel shift patterns among any of the variants as compared with the wild-type protein (data not shown). We then examined the ability of the HsmtSSB variants and non-cognate SSBs to stimulate the dsDNA unwinding activity of HsmtDNA helicase. Interestingly, helicase stimulation by HsmtSSBloop12 and HsmtSSBloop23 reflects their increased ssDNA binding, as maximal stimulation is achieved at lower concentrations of these variants (37 nm) as compared with HsmtSSBwt (50 nm). Nevertheless, maximal stimulation by HsmtSSBloop12 is reduced ∼40% as compared with that by HsmtSSBwt, whereas the reduction caused by HsmtSSBloop23 is only ∼15% (Fig. 2B). In addition, HsmtSSBloop45–2 also showed a ∼40% reduced capacity to stimulate HsmtDNA helicase in vitro, suggesting that residues in loop 1,2 and 4,5–2 are responsible for the functional interactions that we observed between HsmtSSB and HsmtDNA helicase. In comparison, we found that the maximal stimulation of the HsmtDNA helicase by HsmtSSBwt is similar to that contributed by the non-cognate DmmtSSBwt and EcSSB (Fig. 2C), in contrast to the results reported by Korhonen et al. (5Korhonen J.A. Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48627-48632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Next, we measured the stimulation of the DNA polymerase activity of Hspol γ on a singly primed ssDNA template. As we reported previously (4Oliveira M.T. Kaguni L.S. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15379Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we observed that the DNA polymerase activity of Hspol γ in the absence of HsmtSSB was ∼2-fold higher at 100 mm than at 20 mm KCl. In contrast, in the presence of the variant HsmtSSBs, Hspol γ was stimulated at 20 mm KCl, but inhibited completely at 100 mm KCl (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the variants HsmtSSBloop23, HsmtSSBα1, and HsmtSSBloop45–1 show a reduced capacity to stimulate DNA synthesis by Hspol γ (∼60% of that of HsmtSSBwt), which indicates that the altered amino acid residues in these variants are important for the functional interactions between HsmtSSB and Hspol γ. Notably, the stimulation of Hspol γ by these defective variants is similar to that observed with the non-cognate EcSSB, and the HsmtSSB residues identified as important for Hspol γ stimulation differ from those shown to be important for stimulation of HsmtDNA helicase (Fig. 2B). We developed a Drosophila S2 cell system in which we knocked down the DmmtSSB protein (DmmtSSBendo) by treatment with dsRNA homologous to the 3′-UTR of the endogenous gene and expressed an exogenous DmmtSSB variant, to evaluate mtDNA maintenance and replication under various physiological conditions. dsRNA treatment depleted DmmtSSBendo and mtDNA copy number to ∼10 and ∼40% of the levels in the control cells, respectively. In agreement with previous data from our laboratory (6Farr C.L. Matsushima Y. Lagina 3rd, A.T. Luo N. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17047-17053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), expression of an exogenous DmmtSSBwt gene promoted an increase in mtDNA copy number proportional to the level of protein induction (Fig. 4A). We also established stable cell lines carrying the genes for five DmmtSSB variants equivalent to the HsmtSSB variants described above (Q35A/E36A, DmmtSSBloop12; ΔY52-N54, DmmtSSBloop23; L68A/E69A, DmmtSSBα1; Y85A/G86A/E87A, DmmtSSBloop45–1; and Q91A/Q92A/G93A, DmmtSSBloop45–2). Additionally, we established cell lines to express DmmtSSBΔN (Δ1–11) and DmmtSSBΔC (Δ121–124), which we have recently shown to modulate pol γ stimulation in vitro in the human system (4Oliveira M.T. Kaguni L.S. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15379Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, we observed that their induction is consistently poor (data not shown), indicating that the deletion variants are unstable in the cellular environment. Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts showed that expression of the other five variants occurs at high levels after 14 days of induction with 0.4 mm CuSO4 (determined quantitatively to be 5–10-fold higher than DmmtSSBend, data not shown and Fig. 4B, upper panel). Relative mtDNA copy number in cells overexpressing DmmtSSBwt was unchanged, but was reduced significantly (25–60% of that of control cells) in cells overexpressing DmmtSSBloop12, loop23, α1, loop45–1, and loop45–2, and in DmmtSSBendo-knockdown cells (Fig. 4B, lower panel). We then investigated mtDNA repletion in S2 cells expressing the DmmtSSB variants after mtDNA depletion with ethidium bromide (EtBr). Application of low concentrations of EtBr in the cell culture (0.2 μg/ml growth media) depleted mtDNA to ∼30% of that of control cells after 3 days of treatment, without affecting DmmtSSBendo levels (Fig. 5A). After removal of EtBr from the culture, control cells recovered completely from mtDNA depletion in ∼9 days, whereas mtDNA levels in DmmtSSBendo-knockdown cells remained substantially lower (55% of that of control cells) for as long as 15 days. Cells carrying the exogenous DmmtSSBwt gene were treated with dsRNA to knock down DmmtSSBendo, and with CuSO4 to induce the expression of DmmtSSBwt after EtBr treatment. When DmmtSSBwt was expressed at a level comparable to DmmtSSBendo in control cells (in the presence of 0.04 mm CuSO4), recovery from mtDNA depletion also occurred in ∼9 days, after a 3-day lag time. This delay may result from our experimental design, which requires CuSO4 addition to the cells 3 days after the dsRNA treatment (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In contrast to endogenous-level DmmtSSBwt expression, the 3-day lag time was not observed upon DmmtSSBwt overexpression, and mtDNA copy number was restored to normal levels at a faster rate (Fig. 5A, right panel). Next, we induced the five DmmtSSB variant proteins at two expression levels after the combined EtBr and dsRNA treatments: expression levels equivalent to DmmtSSBendo under normal growth conditions (endogenous-level) and overexpression (Fig. 5B). We observed distinct phenotypes of mtDNA depletion,"
https://openalex.org/W2093818952,"The zinc finger transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is regulated posttranslationally. We identified SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as an interacting protein of KLF5 by yeast two-hybrid screen, coimmunoprecipitation, and indirect immunofluorescence studies. The SMURF2-interacting domains in KLF5 were mapped to its carboxyl terminus, including the PY motif of KLF5 and its zinc finger DNA-binding domain. KLF5 protein levels were reduced significantly upon overexpression of SMURF2 but not catalytically inactive SMURF2-C716A mutant or SMURF1. SMURF2 alone reduced the protein stability of KLF5 as shown by cycloheximide chase assay, indicating that SMURF2 specifically destabilizes KLF5. In contrast, KLF5(1-165), a KLF5 amino-terminal construct that lacks the PY motif and DNA binding domain, was not degraded by SMURF2. The degradation of KLF5 by SMURF2 was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and SMURF2 efficiently ubiquitinated both overexpressed and endogenous KLF5. In contrast, knocking down SMURF2 by siRNAs significantly enhanced KLF5 protein levels, reduced ubiquitination of KLF5, and increased the expression of cyclin D1 and PDGF-A, two established KLF5 target genes. In consistence, SMURF2, but not the E3 ligase mutant SMURF2-C716A, significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of KLF5, as demonstrated by dual luciferase assay using the PDGF-A promoter, and suppressed the ability of KLF5 to stimulate cell proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation. Hence, SMURF2 is a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for KLF5 and negatively regulates KLF5 by targeting it for proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1996678144,"μ-Type opioid receptors (MORs) are members of the large seven-transmembrane receptor family which transduce the effects of both endogenous neuropeptides and clinically important opioid drugs. Prolonged activation of MORs promotes their proteolytic degradation by endocytic trafficking to lysosomes. This down-regulation process is known to contribute to homeostatic regulation of cellular opioid responsiveness, but mechanisms that mediate and control MOR down-regulation have not been defined. We show here that lysosomal down-regulation of MORs is ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-dependent and involves ubiquitin-promoted transfer of internalized MORs from the limiting endosome membrane to lumen. We also show that MOR down-regulation measured by conventional radioligand binding assay is determined specifically by ubiquitination in the first cytoplasmic loop. Surprisingly, we were unable to find any role of ubiquitination in determining whether internalized receptors recycle or are delivered to lysosomes. Instead, this decision is dictated specifically by the MOR C-tail and occurs irrespectively of the presence or absence of receptor ubiquitination. Our results support a hierarchical organization of discrete ubiquitin-independent and -dependent sorting operations, which function non-redundantly in the conserved down-regulation pathway to mediate precise endocytic control. Furthermore, they show that this hierarchical mechanism discriminates the endocytic regulation of naturally occurring MOR isoforms. Moreover, they are the first to reveal, we believe, for any seven-transmembrane receptor, a functional role of ubiquitination in the first cytoplasmic loop."
https://openalex.org/W2056918908,"Aebp2 is a potential targeting protein for the mammalian Polycomb Repression Complex 2 (PRC2). We generated a mutant mouse line disrupting the transcription of Aebp2 to investigate its in vivo roles. Aebp2-mutant homozygotes were embryonic lethal while heterozygotes survived to adulthood with fertility. In developing mouse embryos, Aebp2 is expressed mainly within cells of neural crest origin. In addition, many heterozygotes display a set of phenotypes, enlarged colon and hypopigmentation, similar to those observed in human patients with Hirschsprung's disease and Waardenburg syndrome. These phenotypes are usually caused by the absence of the neural crest-derived ganglia in hindguts and melanocytes. ChIP analyses demonstrated that the majority of the genes involved in the migration and development process of neural crest cells are downstream target genes of AEBP2 and PRC2. Furthermore, expression analyses confirmed that some of these genes are indeed affected in the Aebp2 heterozygotes. Taken together, these results suggest that Aebp2 may regulate the migration and development of the neural crest cells through the PRC2-mediated epigenetic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2093410202,"Several physiologically relevant cations including Ca2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ have been shown to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), presumably by competitively displacing one or more Mg2+ ions bound to RT. We analyzed the effects of Zn2+ on reverse transcription and compared them to Ca2+ and Mn2+. Using nucleotide extension efficiency as a readout, Zn2+ showed significant inhibition of reactions with 2 mm Mg2+, even when present at only ∼5 μm. Mn2+ and Ca2+ were also inhibitory but at higher concentrations. Both Mn2+ and Zn2+ (but not Ca2+) supported RT incorporation in the absence of Mg2+ with Mn2+ being much more efficient. The maximum extension rates with Zn2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ were ∼0.1, 1, and 3.5 nucleotides per second, respectively. Zinc supported optimal RNase H activity at ∼25 μm, similar to the optimal for nucleotide addition in the presence of low dNTP concentrations. Surprisingly, processivity (average number of nucleotides incorporated in a single binding event with enzyme) during reverse transcription was comparable with Zn2+ and Mg2+, and single RT molecules were able to continue extension in the presence of Zn2+ for several hours on the same template. Consistent with this result, the half-life for RT-Zn2+-(primer-template) complexes was 220 ± 60 min and only 1.7 ± 1 min with Mg2+, indicating ∼130-fold more stable binding with Zn2+. Essentially, the presence of Zn2+ promotes the formation of a highly stable slowly progressing RT-(primer-template) complex.

https://openalex.org/W2012298075,"The neurons and synapses work coordinately to program the brain codes of controlling cognition and behaviors. Spike patterns at the presynaptic neurons regulate synaptic transmission. The quantitative regulations of synapse dynamics in spike encoding at the postsynaptic neurons remain unclear.With dual whole-cell recordings at synapse-paired cells in mouse cortical slices, we have investigated the regulation of synapse dynamics to neuronal spike encoding at cerebral circuits assembled by pyramidal neurons and GABAergic ones. Our studies at unitary synapses show that postsynaptic responses are constant over time, such as glutamate receptor-channel currents at GABAergic neurons and glutamate transport currents at astrocytes, indicating quantal glutamate release. In terms of its physiological impact, our results demonstrate that the signals integrated from quantal glutamatergic synapses drive spike encoding at GABAergic neurons reliably, which in turn precisely set spike encoding at pyramidal neurons through feedback inhibition.Our studies provide the evidences for the quantal glutamate release to drive the spike encodings precisely in cortical circuits, which may be essential for programming the reliable codes in the brain to manage well-organized behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2016102533,"Background Activin B has been reported to promote the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes in vitro via the RhoA-JNK signaling pathway, whereas its in vivo role and mechanism in wound healing process has not yet been elucidated. Principal Findings In this study, we explored the potential mechanism by which activin B induces epithelial wound healing in mice. Recombinant lentiviral plasmids, with RhoA (N19) and RhoA (L63) were used to infect wounded KM mice. The wound healing process was monitored after different treatments. Activin B-induced cell proliferation on the wounded skin was visualized by electron microscopy and analyzed by 5′-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Protein expression of p-JNK or p-cJun was determined by immunohistochemical staining and immunoblotting analysis. Activin B efficiently stimulated the proliferation of keratinocytes and hair follicle cells at the wound area and promoted wound closure. RhoA positively regulated activin B-induced wound healing by up-regulating the expression of p-JNK and p-cJun. Moreover, suppression of RhoA activation delayed activin B-induced wound healing, while JNK inhibition recapitulated phenotypes of RhoA inhibition on wound healing. Conclusion These results demonstrate that activin B promotes epithelial wound closure in vivo through the RhoA-Rock-JNK-cJun signaling pathway, providing novel insight into the essential role of activin B in the therapy of wound repair."
https://openalex.org/W2009291865,"The halophilic methanoarchaeon Methanohalophilus portucalensis can synthesize the osmolyte betaine de novo in response to extracellular salt stress. Betaine is generated by the stepwise methylation of glycine to form sarcosine, N, N-dimethylglycine and betaine by using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor. The complete gene cluster of Mpgsmt-sdmt was cloned from Southern hybridization and heterologous expressed in E. coli respectively. The recombinant MpGSMT and MpSDMT both retained their in vivo functional activities in E. coli BL21(DE3)RIL to synthesize and accumulate betaine and conferred elevated survival ability in betaine transport deficient mutant E. coli MKH13 under high salt stress. The dramatic activating effects of sodium and potassium ions on the in vitro methyltransferase activities of MpGSMT, but not MpSDMT or bacterial GSMT and SDMT, revealed that GSMT from halophilic methanoarchaeon possesses novel regulate mechanism in betaine biosynthesis pathway. The circular dichroism spectra showed the fluctuated peaks at 206 nm were detected in the MpGSMT under various concentrations of potassium or sodium ions. This fluctuated difference may cause by a change in the β-turn structure located at the conserved glycine- and sarcosine-binding residue Arg167 of MpGSMT. The analytical ultracentrifugation analysis indicated that the monomer MpGSMT switched to dimeric form increased from 7.6% to 70% with KCl concentration increased from 0 to 2.0 M. The level of potassium and sodium ions may modulate the substrate binding activity of MpGSMT through the conformational change. Additionally, MpGSMT showed a strong end product, betaine, inhibitory effect and was more sensitive to the inhibitor AdoHcy. The above results indicated that the first enzymatic step involved in synthesizing the osmolyte betaine in halophilic archaea, namely, GSMT, may also play a major role in coupling the salt-in and compatible solute (osmolyte) osmoadaptative strategies in halophilic methanogens for adapting to high salt environments."
https://openalex.org/W2156732178,"During activation of the phagocyte (Nox2-based) NADPH oxidase, the cytoplasmic Phox complex (p47(phox)-p67(phox)-p40(phox)) translocates and associates with the membrane-spanning flavocytochrome b(558). It is unclear where (in cytoplasm or on membranes), when (before or after assembly), and how p40(phox) acquires its PI(3)P-binding capabilities. We demonstrated that in addition to conformational changes induced by H(2)O(2) in the cytoplasm, p40(phox) acquires PI(3)P-binding through direct or indirect membrane targeting. We also found that p40(phox) is essential when p47(phox) is partially phosphorylated during FcγR-mediated oxidase activation; however, p40(phox) is less critical when p47(phox) is adequately phosphorylated, using phosphorylation-mimicking mutants in HEK293(Nox2/FcγRIIa) and RAW264.7(p40/p47KD) cells. Moreover, PI binding to p47(phox) is less important when the autoinhibitory PX-PB1 domain interaction in p40(phox) is disrupted or when p40(phox) is targeted to membranes. Furthermore, we suggest that high affinity PI(3)P binding of the p40(phox) PX domain is critical during its accumulation on phagosomes, even when masked by the PB1 domain in the resting state. Thus, in addition to mechanisms for directly acquiring PI(3)P binding in the cytoplasm by H(2)O(2), p40(phox) can acquire PI(3)P binding on targeted membranes in a p47(phox)-dependent manner and functions both as a ""carrier"" of the cytoplasmic Phox complex to phagosomes and an ""adaptor"" of oxidase assembly on phagosomes in cooperation with p47(phox), using positive feedback mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2001469425,"Recent characterization of Mcl-1 as the primary anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member expressed in solid tumors, coupled with its ability to enable therapeutic resistance, has provided the impetus for further study into how Mcl-1 is involved in apoptosis signaling. Here, we employ Sabutoclax, a potent and effective Mcl-1 antagonist, as a competing agent to screen a randomized 12-residue phage display library for peptides that bind strongly to the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) binding groove of Mcl-1. Although the screen identified a number of α-helical peptides with canonical BH3 domain sequences, it also isolated a pair of unique peptide sequences. These sequences exhibit a reverse organization of conserved hydrophobic and acidic residues when compared with canonical BH3 sequences, and we therefore refer to them as reverse BH3 (rBH3) peptides. Furthermore, studies of the rBH3 peptides using NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence polarization displacement assays, and alanine scanning data all suggest that they bind to the BH3 binding groove of Mcl-1 selectively over Bcl-x(L). A search for proteins containing the rBH3 motif has identified a number of interesting Mcl-1 protein partners, some of which have previously been associated with apoptosis regulation involving Mcl-1. These findings provide insights into the development of more specific Mcl-1 antagonists and open the way to the identification of a previously unknown family of apoptosis-regulating and Mcl-1 interacting proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2081053063,"Global gene expression profiling has emerged as a major tool in understanding complex response patterns of biological systems to perturbations. However, a lack of unbiased analytical approaches has restricted the utility of complex microarray data to gain novel system level insights. Here we report a strategy, express path analysis (EPA), that helps to establish various pathways differentially recruited to achieve specific cellular responses under contrasting environmental conditions in an unbiased manner. The analysis superimposes differentially regulated genes between contrasting environments onto the network of functional protein associations followed by a series of iterative enrichments and network analysis. To test the utility of the approach, we infected THP1 macrophage cells with a virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain (H37Rv) or the attenuated non-virulent strain H37Ra as contrasting perturbations and generated the temporal global expression profiles. EPA of the results provided details of response-specific and time-dependent host molecular network perturbations. Further analysis identified tyrosine kinase Src as the major regulatory hub discriminating the responses between wild-type and attenuated Mtb infection. We were then able to verify this novel role of Src experimentally and show that Src executes its role through regulating two vital antimicrobial processes of the host cells (i.e. autophagy and acidification of phagolysosome). These results bear significant potential for developing novel anti-tuberculosis therapy. We propose that EPA could prove extremely useful in understanding complex cellular responses for a variety of perturbations, including pathogenic infections."
https://openalex.org/W2013351324,"The modulation of brain activity as a function of auditory location was investigated using electro-encephalography in combination with standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Auditory stimuli were presented at various positions under anechoic conditions in free-field space, thus providing the complete set of natural spatial cues. Variation of electrical activity in cortical areas depending on sound location was analyzed by contrasts between sound locations at the time of the N1 and P2 responses of the auditory evoked potential. A clear-cut double dissociation with respect to the cortical locations and the points in time was found, indicating spatial processing (1) in the primary auditory cortex and posterodorsal auditory cortical pathway at the time of the N1, and (2) in the anteroventral pathway regions about 100 ms later at the time of the P2. Thus, it seems as if both auditory pathways are involved in spatial analysis but at different points in time. It is possible that the late processing in the anteroventral auditory network reflected the sharing of this region by analysis of object-feature information and spectral localization cues or even the integration of spatial and non-spatial sound features."

To address this question, we investigated the biochemical characteristics of the A1Ao-ATP synthase (MbbrA1Ao) of Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1, a predominant methanogen in the rumen. Growth of M. ruminantium M1 was inhibited by protonophores and sodium ionophores, demonstrating that both ion gradients were essential for growth.

ATP synthesis could not be driven by a chemical gradient of sodium ions unless a membrane potential was imposed. ATP synthesis under these conditions was sensitive to monensin but not cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. These data suggest that the M. ruminantium M1 A1Ao-ATP synthase exhibits all the properties of a sodium-coupled enzyme, but it is also able to use protons to drive ATP synthesis under conditions that favor proton coupling, such as low pH and low levels of sodium ions. Microorganisms have been shown to harbor a number of membrane-bound ATP synthases that are used to synthesize ATP via a proton or sodium ion gradient. These enzymes can be divided into three distinct classes as follows: F-type (F1Fo)-ATPases, A-type archaeal (A1Ao)-ATPases, and V-type (V1Vo)-ATPases. The A1Ao-ATP synthase is composed of at least nine different subunits with a stoichiometry of A3B3DE2FH2 for the A1 domain and Cac1–10 for the Ao domain and are structurally more closely related to the V1Vo-ATPases (1Müller V. Grüber G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 474-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2Müller V. Lingl A. Lewalter K. Fritz M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In most described A1Ao-type enzymes, multiple copies of the membrane-bound subunit c form the proteolipid ring of the Ao domain. The proteolipids of A1Ao-ATPases show considerable variability in size (2, 4, 6, or 26 transmembrane helices) and are proposed to have variable coupling stoichiometries (number of ions translocated per ATP synthesized) based on the number of conserved ionizable groups per monomer (2Müller V. Lingl A. Lewalter K. Fritz M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Methanogenic archaea are a group of strictly anaerobic microorganisms that produce methane from a limited group of substrates, such as H2 and CO2, formate, methanol, methylamine, and/or acetate by a pathway involving unique coenzymes (3Thauer R.K. Kaster A.K. Seedorf H. Buckel W. Hedderich R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Methanogens produce both proton and sodium ion gradients during methanogenesis through ion-translocating mechanisms (4Deppenmeier U. Lienard T. Gottschalk G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5Deppenmeier U. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 223-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These gradients are then used to synthesize ATP by a chemiosmotic mechanism involving a membrane-bound A1Ao-ATP synthase (4Deppenmeier U. Lienard T. Gottschalk G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Deppenmeier U. Müller V. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2008; 45: 123-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Schäfer G. Engelhard M. Müller V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 570-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An unresolved issue in this bioenergetic scheme is how these two primary ion gradients are use to synthesize ATP. Examples of proton-coupled (e.g. Methanosarcina mazei Gö1) (8Pisa K.Y. Weidner C. Maischak H. Kavermann H. Müller V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 277: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and sodium-coupled (e.g. Methanothermobacter marburgensis strain Marburg) (9Kaesler B. Schönheit P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Schönheit P. Beimborn D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) A1Ao-ATP synthases have been reported, despite the presence of a sodium ion-binding signature in the c subunits of all methanogen enzymes (11Müller V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that even for bacterial F1Fo-ATP synthases that are sodium ion-coupled, protons are still translocated by these enzymes under conditions that favor proton transport (e.g. low pH and sodium ion concentrations) (12von Ballmoos C. Cook G.M. Dimroth P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 43-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To date, very few A1Ao-ATP synthases from non-cytochrome-containing methanogens have been examined with respect to coupling ion specificity, and the enzymes from mesophilic methanogens have proved difficult to purify from the host organism. The genome of the rumen methanogen Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1 was recently sequenced (13Leahy S.C. Kelly W.J. Altermann E. Ronimus R.S. Yeoman C.J. Pacheco D.M. Li D. Kong Z. McTavish S. Sang C. Lambie S.C. Janssen P.H. Dey D. Attwood G.T. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and this provided us with a molecular platform to address the ion specificity of the A1Ao-ATP synthase from this archaeon. M. ruminantium M1 (DSM 1093) was grown in medium RM02, and the effects of inhibitors were tested as described by Wedlock et al. (14Wedlock D.N. Pedersen G. Denis M. Dey D. Janssen P.H. Buddle B.M. N. Z. Vet. J. 2010; 58: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All inhibitors were dissolved in 0.1 ml of ethanol (or an appropriate control of ethanol), except for amiloride and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), 2The abbreviations used are: EIPA5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amilorideDCCDdicyclohexylcarbodiimideDDMdodecyl maltosideTCEPtris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphineCCCPcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneDNP2,4-dinitrophenolTBT-Cltributyltin chlorideTCS3,3′,4′,5-tetrachlorosalicylanilideGOLDGenetic Optimization for Ligand Docking. which were dissolved in DMSO. Inhibitor or the appropriate diluent was added to 10-ml cultures in the exponential phase (absorbance at 600 nm (A600) ∼0.1, 16-mm path length). 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride dicyclohexylcarbodiimide dodecyl maltoside tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone 2,4-dinitrophenol tributyltin chloride 3,3′,4′,5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking. Typically 2 g of cell pellets were washed and resuspended with pre-cooled TMGT buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgSO4, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mm tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine (TCEP)). Pancreatic DNase I and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were added to 0.1 mg/ml and 0.1 mm, respectively, and the cells were disrupted by sonication on ice five times for 2 min with a tip sonicator. The lysate was cleared of debris by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min, and the inverted membrane vesicles were pelleted from the supernatant at 180,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and resuspended in TMGT buffer to a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Escherichia coli DH10B (15Hanahan D. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 63-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) was used for all cloning experiments, and E. coli DK8 (16Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lacking the ATP synthase genes encoding the unc operon (Δatp), was used to overproduce the A1Ao-ATP synthase of M. ruminantium M1. Other common E. coli expression strains, including C41(DE3), C43(DE3), and BL21(DE3), were also tested (17Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Plasmids used were pUC19 (18Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) for cloning and pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) for overexpression of A1Ao-ATP synthase. To overproduce the A1Ao-ATP synthase, transformants of E. coli DK8 Δatp were routinely grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm in 2× YT medium (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 2 g/liter glucose and 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. The genes encoding for the subunits of the M. ruminantium M1 A1-ATPase (ahaECFABD) were cloned into the expression vector pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) as a 6.2-kb BamHI-XbaI PCR product, amplified utilizing the forward primer MbrA1FWD (5′-AAATTTGGATCCGGAATCTTAGGTTAGGAGGTCAAT-3′) containing a BamHI site and the reverse primer MbrA1Rev (5′-AAATTTTCTAGATAACAAGCAAAATATGAATTGC-3′) containing an XbaI site. M. ruminantium M1 genomic DNA served as the template. The amplicon was digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into pTrc99A digested with the same restriction enzymes, creating the plasmid pTrMbrA1. To facilitate purification, an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag was introduced into subunit A (atpA) by PCR overlap extension (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The plasmid pTrMbrA1 was used as the template for primers MbrA1HisMid (5′-TTAGACAAGTTCTTAGTCGACTCTG-3′), overlapping a natural SalI site, and the primer MbrA1HisRev (5′-ATGATGATGATGATGATGCATCCCATCTGCGACGATAACAGG-3′), generating a 0.55-kb PCR product. A second PCR was performed with the primers MbrA1HisFWD (5′-ATGCATCATCATCATCATCATAGAGGAACTCAAATGTATGAA-3′) and MbrA1REV, generating a 3.9-kb fragment. The 0.55- and 3.9-kb fragment were then used for PCR overlap extension with the external primers MbrA1HisMid and MbrA1Rev. The 4.45-kb product obtained was digested with SalI and XbaI. Plasmid pTrMbrA1 was digested with BamHI and SalI, and the 1.7-kb BamHI-SalI fragment generated from this digestion along with the 4.45-kb SalI-XbaI PCR overlap product fragment were ligated simultaneously into pTrc99a digested with BamHI and XbaI to create the plasmid pTrMbrA1His. To construct a plasmid containing the entire atp operon, the genes (atpHIK) encoding the M. ruminantium Ao subunits were cloned by PCR using the forward primer MbrAoFWD containing an NcoI site (5′-ATTTAATTACCATGGTGATTTATTATGGCA-3′) and the reverse primer MbrAoREV (5′-AGAGACAATTTTATCTGCCCCAGAGCTCAT-3′) containing a SacI site. The 3.3-kb fragment was digested with NcoI and SacI and ligated into the plasmid pTrMbrA1HIS digested with NcoI and SacI, thereby creating the plasmid pTrMbrA1AoHIS containing the full-length M. ruminantium M1 atp operon with an N-terminal hexa-His-tagged subunit A. E. coli strain DK8 (Δatp) harboring plasmid pTrMbbrA1AoHis was grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm in 2× YT medium (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 2 g of glucose/liter and 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. At an A600 (10-mm path length) of 0.4, the culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubation continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested, washed with pre-cooled TMGT buffer, and resuspended in the same buffer. PMSF was added to 0.1 mm, and the cells were disrupted by three passages through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Pancreatic DNase I was added to 0.1 mg/ml, and the mixture was kept on ice for 1 h or until viscosity decreased. The lysate was cleared of debris by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min, and the inverted membrane vesicles were pelleted from the supernatant at 180,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Inverted membrane vesicles were washed twice in TMGT buffer and resuspended in 50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgSO4, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.1 mm TCEP. To extract the MbbrA1Ao, membrane vesicles were diluted to 5 mg of protein/ml in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgSO4, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM), 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.1 mm TCEP) and incubated with gentle stirring at 4 °C for 2 h. The nonsolubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation (180,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The supernatant was applied to an IMAC column containing high performance nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated with purification buffer A (50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgSO4, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) DDM, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.1 mm TCEP) containing 10 mm imidazole. To remove contaminating proteins, the column was washed first with purification buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole and second with purification buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole. The MbbrA1Ao was eluted with purification buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. Further removal of other protein contaminants and excess salts was performed by precipitation with polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000). The eluate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 10% (w/v) PEG6000, and the precipitate was subsequently removed by centrifugation at 54,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The MbbrA1Ao was then precipitated by incubating the supernatant for 1 h with 15% (w/v) PEG6000. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 54,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.5 ml of resuspension buffer A (50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgSO4, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) DDM, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.1 mm TCEP). PEG6000 was pelleted by a 1-min centrifugation at 17,000 × g, the pellet discarded, and the supernatant containing the purified protein retained. To extract the c-oligomer (proteolipid), a chloroform/methanol extraction was performed using purified MbbrA1Ao. This was carried out as described by Dmitriev et al. (21Dmitriev O.Y. Altendorf K. Fillingame R.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using 10% (w/v) citric acid as the buffer. MbbrA1Ao preparations were routinely analyzed on 14% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS using the buffer system of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Polypeptide bands were visualized using either Simply Blue® Safe Stain (Invitrogen) or by silver staining (23Nesterenko M.V. Tilley M. Upton S.J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Where trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation was applied, TCA was added to purified MbbrA1Ao solution to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) and incubated on ice for 5 min. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 × g to ensure all protein was collected, and the pellets were washed with 200 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.9). The pellet was resuspended in resuspension buffer A, heated for 5 min at 96 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. During immunoblotting, membrane vesicles were subjected to 14% SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, ensuring efficient transfer by including 0.02% (w/v) SDS in the running buffer of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Detection was achieved using a penta-His antibody conjugate (Qiagen) directed against the hexa-histidine tag of the A subunits of the recombinant A1Ao as described previously (24McMillan D.G. Keis S. Dimroth P. Cook G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17395-17404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The antibody-specific bands were visualized using the SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescence system. The identification of the A1Ao-ATP synthase subunits was further confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF MS) on a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF analyzer (AB Sciex, MA). Protein bands, corresponding to the predicted sizes of the A1Ao subunits, were excised from the gel, and proteins in-gel were digested with trypsin following the protocol of Shevchenko et al. (25Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). All MS spectra were acquired in positive ion mode with 800 laser pulses per sample spot. The strongest 15 precursor ions per sample spot were selected for collision-induced dissociation MS/MS with 1600 laser pulses per precursor. For protein identification, collision-induced dissociation MS/MS peak lists were searched against the Swiss-Prot amino acid sequence data base using the Mascot search engine. ATP hydrolysis activity was determined at pH 6.5 in an assay containing 100 mm MES, 40 mm sodium acetate, 40 mm Na2S2O5, 10 mm MgSO4, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. For determination of ATPase activity in the absence of sodium ions, the assay buffer contained potassium acetate and K2S2O5 to replace the respective sodium salts. For pH range examination (pH 5–9), 100 mm MES, 100 mm MOPS, and 100 mm Tris·Cl were included. The reaction was started using either sodium-ATP or Tris-ATP to a final concentration of 2.5 mm. ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C using a colorimetric assay that detects inorganic phosphate liberated from ATP as described previously by Heinonen and Lahti (26Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Nonenzymatic degradation of ATP under these conditions was less than 10% of the total phosphate. One unit of ATPase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme liberating 1 μmol of Pi or ADP/min at 37 °C. Approximately 50–100 μg of recombinant A1Ao-ATP synthase was used for measurements. ATP synthesis experiments were performed using inverted membrane vesicles of E. coli DK8 (Δatp) expressing MbbrA1Ao and prepared at pH 7.8. Assays were performed at 30 °C in 2 ml of assay buffer A containing 50 mm MES (pH 6.50), 40 mm potassium acetate, 40 mm K2S2O5, 10 mm MgSO4, 160 mm KCl, 1.5 mm ADP, 5 mm KH2PO4. Inverted membrane vesicles (0.5 mg) were diluted 40-fold into assay buffer, and ATP synthesis reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μm valinomycin to induce a potassium diffusion potential of ∼100 mV as calculated using the Nernst equation: 59 × log10([K+]out/[K+]in). To create a chemical gradient of sodium ions (ΔpNa+) of 95 mV (59 × log10([Na+]out/[Na+]in), NaCl-loaded (125 mm) vesicles were diluted 40-fold into the assay buffer. Vesicles not loaded with NaCl were subjected to the same treatment. At various time intervals, 100-μl aliquots were removed and transferred to 400 μl of stop solution (1% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 2 mm EDTA). Each sample was diluted 250-fold in water prior to the measurement of ATP using the luciferin-luciferase assay (27Lundin A. Thore A. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 30: 713-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure ATP, each sample was diluted into 400 μl of Tris acetate buffer (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm MgCl2) in a luminometer tube. Fifty μl of luciferin-luciferase reagent (Sigma) was added to the tube, and the chemiluminescence was monitored with an FB12 chemiluminometer (Berthold). The amount of ATP synthesized was calculated from a standard curve performed on the day of each set of ATP measurements. For each individual experimental set, the presence of background ATP was measured using nonenergized vesicles and subtracted from total ATP measured. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The M. ruminantium c-oligomer was modeled in Coot (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) using the rotor ring structure of ATP synthase subunit K of Enterococcus hirae (Protein Data Bank codes 2CYD and 2DB4) as a template. Using the Clustal sequence alignment of the deduced amino acids, individual residues were mutated taking care to correctly fit rotamers to produce the most accurate homology model. Molecular docking experiments were carried out using the program Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking (GOLD), version 5.0 (29Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar), and favoring the Piecewise Linear Potential (CHEMPLP) fitness function. The binding site was composed of residues that fell within 10 Å of the conserved active site residue Glu-140. The GOLD runs employed a 100% search efficiency, and the diverse solutions options was turned on using a cluster size of 2 and root mean square deviation of 2 Å. Hydrogen bonding interactions were encouraged with the active site glutamate and the guanidinium moiety of inhibitors amiloride and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) (Scheme 1) by allowing the residue to rotate freely during the docking process. Twenty binding poses were generated and inspected for each inhibitor, and conformations were chosen taking into account their ranking, interactions with active site residues, and by monitoring per atom scores generated by GOLD and the CHEMPLP fitness function. M. ruminantium M1 is found in ruminant animals fed a wide variety of diets (30Janssen P.H. Kirs M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 3619-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and grows with H2 plus CO2 and formate, producing methane (31Smith P.H. Hungate R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1958; 75: 713-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the role of different electrochemical gradients in the growth of M1, we tested the effect of various uncouplers, ionophores, and ATP synthase inhibitors on the growth of M. ruminantium M1. M. ruminantium M1 was inhibited by the protonophores CCCP, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), and 3,3′,4′,5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS), but the sensitivity to these agents varied, with DNP and TCS being the most potent (Fig. 1, A–C). Monensin, an electroneutral Na+/H+ antiporter that dissipates the chemical gradient of Na+ ions, was a potent growth inhibitor of M. ruminantium M1 (Fig. 1D). Amiloride, and its more hydrophobic derivative EIPA, are blockers of sodium channels and Na+/H+ antiporter activity, and both compounds inhibited growth of M. ruminantium M1 (Fig. 1, E and F). The ATP synthase inhibitors dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and tributyltin chloride (TBT-Cl) slowed growth of M. ruminantium M1, but only TBT-Cl completely arrested growth (Fig. 1, G and H). Taken together, these data demonstrate that M. ruminantium M1 requires both a proton-motive force and sodium-motive force to grow and that classical ATP synthase inhibitors slow growth of M1. To study the role of these gradients in membrane bioenergetics, we purified and characterized the A1Ao-ATP synthase from M. ruminantium M1. Membrane vesicles of M. ruminantium M1 were prepared from cells grown in anaerobic RM02 medium and assayed for ATPase activity by measuring the liberation of Pi from ATP hydrolysis. The specific activity of ATP hydrolysis in membranes of M. ruminantium M1 was low, 0.080 ± 0.009 units/mg protein, but comparable with the ATPase activity of other A1Ao enzymes (8Pisa K.Y. Weidner C. Maischak H. Kavermann H. Müller V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 277: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Pisa K.Y. Huber H. Thomm M. Müller V. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3928-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Lingl A. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Mayer F. Kellermann J. Müller V. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Wilms R. Freiberg C. Wegerle E. Meier I. Mayer F. Müller V. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of M1 membrane vesicles was stable at 4 °C for up to 5 days, and activity declined after this point (data not shown). The ATPase activity of M1 membranes was sensitive to TBT-Cl and amiloride (Fig. 2, A and B), but DCCD was without significant effect (Fig. 2A). The genome of M. ruminantium M1 has recently been sequenced and harbors genes for an A-type ATP synthase (13Leahy S.C. Kelly W.J. Altermann E. Ronimus R.S. Yeoman C.J. Pacheco D.M. Li D. Kong Z. McTavish S. Sang C. Lambie S.C. Janssen P.H. Dey D. Attwood G.T. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The nine genes are arranged in an operon in the order ahaHIKECFABD (viz. mru695-703) and encode the M. ruminantium M1 A1Ao-ATP synthase subunits H, I (a), K (c), E, C, F, A, B, and D, respectively. The start codon of each gene was designated by alignment of aha gene sequences with those of other microorganisms and the positions of potential ribosome-binding sites. The genome contains only one copy of the aha operon, and no F-type ATP synthases are present in the genome sequence (13Leahy S.C. Kelly W.J. Altermann E. Ronimus R.S. Yeoman C.J. Pacheco D.M. Li D. Kong Z. McTavish S. Sang C. Lambie S.C. Janssen P.H. Dey D. Attwood G.T. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The ahaHIKECFABD operon, coding for MbbrA1Ao with a hexa-histidine tag at the N terminus of the A subunit, was cloned into the expression plasmid pTrc99A, and expression was tested in a number of different E. coli hosts: atp operon deletion mutant E. coli DK8 (Δatp) and common E. coli expression strains C41, C43, and BL21. All cells were induced with 1 mm IPTG, and immediately after induction the growth rate of all E. coli strains slowed, although growth was not completely inhibited (data not shown). The cells were grown for 4 h at 30 °C after induction and harvested. An immunoblot of the inverted membrane vesicles, which targeted the hexa-histidine tag on the N terminus of the A subunit, revealed that the MbbrA1Ao was indeed expressed (Fig. 3A). Various detergents, decyl maltoside, DDM, Triton X-100, CHAPS, sodium cholate, octylglucoside, and FOS-choline, were tested for their ability to extract and solubilize the A1Ao-ATP synthase from E. coli membranes. FOS-choline (0.5% (v/v) final concentration) was the most effective detergent for extracting the A1Ao-ATP synthase from E. coli membranes (>90%), but the enzyme lost activity rapidly in this detergent (data not shown). DDM (1% (w/v) final concentration) was only 40% effective at extracting A1Ao, but the enzyme retained good activity in this detergent. The DDM-solubilized A1Ao was purified using immobilized metal (nickel-Sepharose) ion affinity chromatography exploiting the His tag on the A subunit and eluted with 100 mm imidazole. The A1Ao fraction was further purified and concentrated by PEG precipitation (15% (w/v) PEG6000), and the final preparation was resuspended in 10 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.05% (w/v) DDM. The activity of the purified A1Ao-ATP synthase was 0.92 units/mg protein. SDS-PAGE analysis and MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the purified recombinant enzyme identified all nine subunits (Fig. 3B) as follows: c subunit (atpK) (predicted 15 kDa"

It is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum by a conserved family of dolichyl phosphate mannose-dependent protein O-mannosyltransferases (PMTs). PMTs are integral membrane proteins with two hydrophilic loops (loops 1 and 5) facing the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Formation of dimeric PMT complexes is crucial for mannosyltransferase activity, but the direct cause is not known to date. In bakers' yeast, O-mannosylation is catalyzed largely by heterodimeric Pmt1p-Pmt2p and homodimeric Pmt4p complexes. To further characterize Pmt1p-Pmt2p complexes, we developed a photoaffinity probe based on the artificial mannosyl acceptor substrate Tyr-Ala-Thr-Ala-Val. The photoreactive probe was preferentially cross-linked to Pmt1p, and deletion of the loop 1 (but not loop 5) region abolished this interaction. Analysis of Pmt1p loop 1 mutants revealed that especially Glu-78 is crucial for binding of the photoreactive probe. Glu-78 belongs to an Asp-Glu motif that is highly conserved among PMTs. We further demonstrate that single amino acid substitutions in this motif completely abolish activity of Pmt4p complexes. In contrast, both acidic residues need to be exchanged to eliminate activity of Pmt1p-Pmt2p complexes. On the basis of our data, we propose that the loop 1 regions of dimeric complexes form part of the catalytic site. Protein O-mannosylation is an essential modification in fungi and mammals.

These two isoform sets have opposing cell functions: pro-survival and pro-death, respectively. Although much is known about the regulation and function of sCLU as a pro-survival factor, the regulation and function of endogenous nCLU in cell death are relatively unexplored.

In many organisms this process involves up to 10 (CcmABCDEFGHI and CcdA) membrane proteins. One of these proteins is CcmI, which has an N-terminal membrane-embedded domain with two transmembrane helices and a large C-terminal periplasmic domain with protein-protein interaction motifs. Together with CcmF and CcmH, CcmI forms a multisubunit heme ligation complex. How the CcmFHI complex recognizes its apocytochrome c substrates remained unknown. In this study, using Rhodobacter capsulatus apocytochrome c2 as a Ccm substrate, we demonstrate for the first time that CcmI binds apocytochrome c2 but not holocytochrome c2. Mainly the C-terminal portions of both CcmI and apocytochrome c2 mediate this binding. Other physical interactions via the conserved structural elements in apocytochrome c2, like the heme ligating cysteines or heme iron axial ligands, are less crucial. Furthermore, we show that the N-terminal domain of CcmI can also weakly bind apocytochrome c2, but this interaction requires a free thiol group at apocytochrome c2 heme binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2061757853,"In response to deregulated oncogene activation, mammalian cells activate disposal programs such as programmed cell death. To investigate the mechanisms behind this oncogenic stress response we used Bcr-Abl over-expressing cells cultivated in presence of imatinib. Imatinib deprivation led to rapid induction of Bcr-Abl activity and over-stimulation of PI3K/Akt-, Ras/MAPK-, and JAK/STAT pathways. This resulted in a delayed necrosis-like cell death starting not before 48 hours after imatinib withdrawal. Cell death was preceded by enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and amino acid metabolism leading to elevated ATP and protein levels. This enhanced metabolism could be linked to induction of cell death as inhibition of glycolysis or glutaminolysis was sufficient to sustain cell viability. Therefore, these data provide first evidence that metabolic changes induced by Bcr-Abl hyper-activation are important mediators of oncogenic stress-induced cell death. During the first 30 hours after imatinib deprivation, Bcr-Abl hyper-activation did not affect proliferation but resulted in cellular swelling, vacuolization, and induction of eIF2α phosphorylation, CHOP expression, as well as alternative splicing of XPB, indicating endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Cell death was dependent on p38 and RIP1 signaling, whereas classical death effectors of ER stress, namely CHOP-BIM were antagonized by concomitant up-regulation of Bcl-xL. Screening of 1,120 compounds for their potential effects on oncogenic stress-induced cell death uncovered that corticosteroids antagonize cell death upon Bcr-Abl hyper-activation by normalizing cellular metabolism. This protective effect is further demonstrated by the finding that corticosteroids rendered lymphocytes permissive to the transforming activity of Bcr-Abl. As corticosteroids are used together with imatinib for treatment of Bcr-Abl positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia these data could have important implications for the design of combination therapy protocols. In conclusion, excessive induction of Warburg type metabolic alterations can cause cell death. Our data indicate that these metabolic changes are major mediators of oncogenic stress induced by Bcr-Abl."
https://openalex.org/W2054496263,"The adhesin NadA favors cell adhesion/invasion by hypervirulent Neisseria meningitidis B (MenB). Its recombinant form NadAΔ351–405, devoid of the outer membrane domain, is an immunogenic candidate for an anti-MenB vaccine able to stimulate monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanism of NadAΔ351–405 cellular effects in monocytes. We show that NadAΔ351–405 (against which we obtained polyclonal antibodies in rabbits), binds to hsp90, but not to other extracellular homologous heat shock proteins grp94 and hsp70, in vitro and on the surface of monocytes, in a temperature dependent way. Pre-incubation of monocytes with the MenB soluble adhesin interfered with the binding of anti-hsp90 and anti-hsp70 antibodies to hsp90 and hsp70 at 37°C, a condition in which specific cell-binding occurs, but not at 0°C, a condition in which specific cell-binding is very diminished. Conversely, pre-incubation of monocytes with anti-hsp90 and anti-hsp70 antibodies did not affected NadAΔ351–405 cell binding in any temperature condition, indicating that it associates to another receptor on their plasma membrane and then laterally diffuses to encounter hsp90. Consistently, polymixin B interfered with NadAΔ351–405 /hsp90 association, abrogated the decrease of anti-hsp90 antibodies binding to the cell surface due to NadAΔ351–405 and inhibited adhesin-induced cytokine/chemokine secretion without affecting monocyte-adhesin binding. Co-stimulation of monocytes with anti-hsp90 antibodies and NadAΔ351–405 determined a stronger but polymixin B insensitive cell activation. This indicated that the formation of a recombinant NadA/hsp90/hsp70 complex, although essential for full monocyte stimulation, can be replaced by anti-hsp90 antibody/hsp90 binding. Finally, the activation of monocytes by NadAΔ351–405 alone or in the presence of anti-hsp90 antibodies were both inhibited by neutralizing anti-TLR4 antibodies, but not by anti-TLR2 antibodies. We propose that hsp90-dependent recruitment into an hsp90/hsp70/TLR4 transducing signal complex is necessary for the immune-stimulating activity of NadAΔ351–405 anti-MenB vaccine candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2054755153,"DNA mismatch repair (MMR) greatly contributes to genome integrity via the correction of mismatched bases that are mainly generated by replication errors. Postreplicative MMR excises a relatively long tract of error-containing single-stranded DNA. MutL is a widely conserved nicking endonuclease that directs the excision reaction to the error-containing strand of the duplex by specifically nicking the daughter strand. Because MutL apparently exhibits nonspecific nicking endonuclease activity in vitro, the regulatory mechanism of MutL has been argued. Recent studies suggest ATP-dependent conformational and functional changes of MutL, indicating that the regulatory mechanism involves the ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle. In this study, we investigated the effect of ATP binding on the structure of MutL. First, a cross-linking experiment confirmed that the N-terminal ATPase domain physically interacts with the C-terminal endonuclease domain. Next, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry clarified that the binding of ATP to the N-terminal domain induces local structural changes at the catalytic sites of MutL C-terminal domain. Finally, on the basis of the results of the hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiment, we successfully identified novel regions essential for the endonuclease activity of MutL. The results clearly show that ATP modulates the nicking endonuclease activity of MutL via structural rearrangements of the catalytic site. In addition, several Lynch syndrome-related mutations in human MutL homolog are located in the position corresponding to the newly identified catalytic region. Our data contribute toward understanding the relationship between mutations in MutL homolog and human disease."

Although an intact ubiquitination pathway and a functional nuclear export sequence are required for p53 nuclear export, the role of specific residues within this region in regulating both processes remains largely unknown. Here we characterize the mechanisms accounting for the nuclear accumulation of a new point mutation (Lys-351 to Asn) in the nuclear export sequence of p53 identified in a cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line (A2780 CIS). We found that K351N substitution abrogates the monoubiquitination of p53 induced by both Mdm2 and MSL2 E3-ligases. As a consequence, cells expressing p53 K351N mutant showed defects in cisplatin-induced translocation of p53 to mitochondria, Bax oligomerization, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. These data identify K351N as a critical mutation of p53 that contributes to the development and maintenance of resistance to cisplatin."

Specifically, we manipulated the orientations of Gabor elements surrounding an embedded shape outline. The amplitudes of early visual components over posterior scalp regions were changed by the presence of a contour, and by the orientation of elements surrounding the contour. Differences in context type had an effect on the early P1 and N1 components, but not on the later P2 component. The presence of a contour had an effect on the N1 and P2 components, but not on the earlier P1 component. A modulatory effect of context on contour integration was observed on the N1 component. These results highlight the importance of the context in which contour integration takes place."
https://openalex.org/W1987483804,"Background Since, similarly to humans, songbirds learn their vocalization through imitation during their juvenile stage, they have often been used as model animals to study the mechanisms of human verbal learning. Numerous anatomical and physiological studies have suggested that songbirds have a neural network called ‘song system’ specialized for vocal learning and production in their brain. However, it still remains unknown what molecular mechanisms regulate their vocal development. It has been suggested that type-II cadherins are involved in synapse formation and function. Previously, we found that type-II cadherin expressions are switched in the robust nucleus of arcopallium from cadherin-7-positive to cadherin-6B-positive during the phase from sensory to sensorimotor learning stage in a songbird, the Bengalese finch. Furthermore, in vitro analysis using cultured rat hippocampal neurons revealed that cadherin-6B enhanced and cadherin-7 suppressed the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents via regulating dendritic spine morphology. Methodology/Principal Findings To explore the role of cadherins in vocal development, we performed an in vivo behavioral analysis of cadherin function with lentiviral vectors. Overexpression of cadherin-7 in the juvenile and the adult stages resulted in severe defects in vocal production. In both cases, harmonic sounds typically seen in the adult Bengalese finch songs were particularly affected. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that cadherins control vocal production, particularly harmonic sounds, probably by modulating neuronal morphology of the RA nucleus. It appears that the switching of cadherin expressions from sensory to sensorimotor learning stage enhances vocal production ability to make various types of vocalization that is essential for sensorimotor learning in a trial and error manner."
https://openalex.org/W2045490589,"Background Here we report specific activities of all seven naturally occurring LinA variants towards three different isomers, α, γ and δ, of a priority persistent pollutant, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH). Sequence-structure-function differences contributing to the differences in their stereospecificity for α-, γ-, and δ-HCH and enantiospecificity for (+)- and (−)-α -HCH are also discussed. Methodology/Principal Findings Enzyme kinetic studies were performed with purified LinA variants. Models of LinA2B90A A110T, A111C, A110T/A111C and LinA1B90A were constructed using the FoldX computer algorithm. Turnover rates (min−1) showed that the LinAs exhibited differential substrate affinity amongst the four HCH isomers tested. α-HCH was found to be the most preferred substrate by all LinA's, followed by the γ and then δ isomer. Conclusions/Significance The kinetic observations suggest that LinA-γ1-7 is the best variant for developing an enzyme-based bioremediation technology for HCH. The majority of the sequence variation in the various linA genes that have been isolated is not neutral, but alters the enantio- and stereoselectivity of the encoded proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2026466081,"2-Oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent dioxygenases are ubiquitous iron containing enzymes that couple substrate oxidation to the conversion of 2OG to succinate and carbon dioxide. They participate in a wide range of biological processes including collagen biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, hypoxic sensing and demethylation of nucleic acids and histones. Although substantial progress has been made in elucidating their function, the role of many 2OG dioxygenases remains enigmatic. Here we have studied the 2OG and iron (Fe(II)) dependent dioxygenase Ofd2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a member of the AlkB subfamily of dioxygenases. We show that decarboxylation of 2OG by recombinant Ofd2 is dependent on Fe(II) and a histidine residue predicted to be involved in Fe(II) coordination. The decarboxylase activity of Ofd2 is stimulated by histones, and H2A has the strongest effect. Ofd2 interacts with all four core histones, however, only very weakly with H4. Our results define a new subclass of AlkB proteins interacting with histones, which also might comprise some of the human AlkB homologs with unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W2077830428,"Type III Nrg1, a member of the Nrg1 family of signaling proteins, is expressed in sensory neurons, where it can signal in a bi-directional manner via interactions with the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (ErbB RTKs) [1]. Type III Nrg1 signaling as a receptor (Type III Nrg1 back signaling) can acutely activate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PtdIns3K) signaling, as well as regulate levels of α7* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, along sensory axons [2]. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a cation-permeable ion channel found in primary sensory neurons that is necessary for the detection of thermal pain and for the development of thermal hypersensitivity to pain under inflammatory conditions [3]. Cell surface expression of TRPV1 can be enhanced by activation of PtdIns3K [4], [5], [6], making it a potential target for regulation by Type III Nrg1. We now show that Type III Nrg1 signaling in sensory neurons affects functional axonal TRPV1 in a PtdIns3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, mice heterozygous for Type III Nrg1 have specific deficits in their ability to respond to noxious thermal stimuli and to develop capsaicin-induced thermal hypersensitivity to pain. Cumulatively, these results implicate Type III Nrg1 as a novel regulator of TRPV1 and a molecular mediator of nociceptive function."
https://openalex.org/W2118612829,"In a previous study, we showed that membrane depolarization induced elevation of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates (PtdIns(4,5)P(2), also known as PIP(2)) and subsequently increased the KCNQ2/Q3 currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes through increased PI4 kinase activity. In this study, the underlying mechanism for this depolarization-induced enhancement of PIP(2) synthesis was further investigated. Our results indicate that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme βII was responsible for the enhanced PIP(2) synthesis. We found that phorbol-12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC, mimicked the effects of the membrane depolarization by increasing KCNQ2/Q3 activity, elevating membrane PIP(2) levels and increasing activity of PI4 kinase β. Furthermore, membrane depolarization enhanced PKC activity. The effects of both depolarization and PMA were blocked by a PKC inhibitor or PI4 kinase β RNA interference. Further results demonstrate that the depolarization selectively activated the PKC βII isoform and enhanced its interaction with PI4 kinase β. These results reveal that the depolarization-induced elevation of membrane PIP(2) is through activation of PKC and the subsequent increased activity of PI4 kinase β."
https://openalex.org/W1995506925,"In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin-profilin interface, Ala(167) of the actin barbed end W-loop and His(372) near the C terminus form a clamp around a profilin segment containing residue Arg(81) and Tyr(79). Modeling suggests that altering steric packing in this interface regulates actin activity. An actin A167E mutation could increase interface crowding and alter actin regulation, and A167E does cause growth defects and mitochondrial dysfunction. We assessed whether a profilin Y79S mutation with its decreased mass could compensate for actin A167E crowding and rescue the mutant phenotype. Y79S profilin alone caused no growth defect in WT actin cells under standard conditions in rich medium and rescued the mitochondrial phenotype resulting from both the A167E and H372R actin mutations in vivo consistent with our model. Rescue did not result from effects of profilin on actin nucleotide exchange or direct effects of profilin on actin polymerization. Polymerization of A167E actin was less stimulated by formin Bni1 FH1-FH2 fragment than was WT actin. Addition of WT profilin to mixtures of A167E actin and formin fragment significantly altered polymerization kinetics from hyperbolic to a decidedly more sigmoidal behavior. Substitution of Y79S profilin in this system produced A167E behavior nearly identical to that of WT actin. A167E actin caused more dynamic actin cable behavior in vivo than observed with WT actin. Introduction of Y79S restored cable movement to a more normal phenotype. Our studies implicate the importance of the actin-profilin interface for formin-dependent actin and point to the involvement of formin and profilin in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function."
https://openalex.org/W2015060437,"N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutagenesis is a powerful tool for the study of gene function and the generation of human disease models. A large number of mouse mutants obtained by ENU-induced mutagenesis with a variety of phenotypes have been recovered. However, after genetic confirmation testing, only approximately 50% of the abnormal phenotypes were found to be heritable.A mouse mutant, Dp1, with a dilated pupil phenotype was induced with an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis strategy. Sequence analysis for Nrg1 reveals a G>A base substitution that flanks exon E59, encoding for an EGFβ domain, in the 5' splice donor site. The mutation affects but does not abolish the splicing of EGFβ-type Nrg1 mRNA in Dp1 mice and produces several different transcripts by activating other, cryptic splice sites. These types of protein isoforms are expected, and the result shows that, in the mutant, the effect is a decrease in but not an elimination of the high affinity EGFβ-type Nrg1 isoforms. This is partially compensated for by an increase in expression of the low affinity alpha forms or inactive proteins, suggesting that the mutation results in a hypomorphic allele. Interestingly, genetic model testing shows that Dp1 is a mutation that results in a dilated pupil phenotype that is inherited with very low penetrance when heterozygous and with complete penetrance when homozygous. Pharmacological and immunohistochemical tests show a reduction of muscarinic (M) receptors in the sphincter pupillae of Dp1 mice, which is a major cause of dilated pupils.This study is the first report of an Nrg1 mutation being associated with a dilated pupil phenotype and the reduction of M receptors. This report may help in establishing more mutant mouse lines and models of human genetic disease and can be applied to other organisms. Dp1 mice are a valuable resource for the further clarification of Nrg1 biological function."

ACC1 is a cytosolic enzyme expressed mostly in liver and adipose tissue that catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis. ACC2 is associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane, found mostly in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and is involved in regulating fatty acid oxidation via allosteric inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (8Tong L.

Human ACCs are promising targets for the development of pharmaceutical treatments of obesity and diabetes. Two of every three adults in America are overweight or obese (9Hill J.O. Wyatt H.R. Reed G.W. Peters J.C. Science. 2003; 299: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Moreover, obesity can also lead to secondary health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and atherosclerosis (10Friedman J.M. Science. 2003; 299: 856-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It has been shown that genetically modified mice lacking ACC2 have elevated levels of fatty acid oxidation, reduced body fat, and body weight (5Abu-Elheiga L. Matzuk M.M. Abo-Hashema K.A. Wakil S.J.

Because of the dual effects of malonyl CoA on de novo lipogenesis and β oxidation of fatty acids, an ACC inhibitor is likely to reduce fatty acid synthesis in liver and adipose tissue while increasing fatty acid oxidation in liver and muscle tissues resulting in increased energy expenditure, weight loss, and improved insulin sensitivity (14Harwood Jr., H.J. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2005; 9: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, a small molecule (Compound 1, see Fig. 1) has been shown to be a potent isozyme-nonselective inhibitor of mammalian ACCs (15Harwood Jr., H.J. Petras S.F. Shelly L.D. Zaccaro L.M. Perry D.A.

In cell cultures as well as in experimental animal models, compound 1 was shown to reduce tissue malonyl CoA levels, inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis, and stimulate fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, ACCs are attractive targets for antiobesity and antidiabetes drug discovery (15Harwood Jr., H.J. Petras S.F. Shelly L.D. Zaccaro L.M. Perry D.A. Makowski M.R. Hargrove D.M. Martin K.A.

Recently, the x-ray crystal structures of yeast CT domain and free enzyme as well as its complex with CoA and the inhibitors haloxyfop or diclofop have been reported (16Zhang H. Yang Z. Shen Y. Tong L. Science. 2003; 299: 2064-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Zhang H. Tweel B. Li J. Tong L. Structure. 2004; 12: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The structures reveal that the active site of the CT domain is located at the interface of a dimer of the enzyme. The inhibitors are located at the dimer interface and inhibit the enzymatic activity by disrupting the binding or the conformation of the acetyl CoA or malonyl CoA substrate. Efforts to date to achieve structural information on the human ACC1 and ACC2 CT domain have been hampered by unknown reasons although the recombinant protein yields and biochemical properties (i.e. stability, phosphorylation, and homogeneity) are very encouraging. Recently, Madauss et al. (18Madauss K.P. Burkhart W.A. Consler T.G. Cowan D.J. Gottschalk W.K. Miller A.B. Short S.A. Tran T.B. Williams S.P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported the low resolution crystal structure of the human ACC2 CT domain. As expected, the human ACC2 CT domain resembles the yeast CT domain in all respects but includes a novel extension of the CT dimer interface via three intertwined helices that were not observed in the yeast structure (16Zhang H. Yang Z. Shen Y. Tong L. Science. 2003; 299: 2064-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Zhang H. Tweel B. Li J. Tong L.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 5910-5915Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 39 residues of the human enzyme that form this intertwined helical structure were shown to confer binding activity of known ACC inhibitors to the human CT domain (18Madauss K.P. Burkhart W.A. Consler T.G. Cowan D.J. Gottschalk W.K. Miller A.B. Short S.A. Tran T.B. Williams S.P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of the authentic human ACC2 CT domain, the resolution of the resulting crystal structures suggests that the higher resolution yeast ACC CT domain structure may yet be a better surrogate for structure-based drug design efforts. Here, we describe an alternative strategy that involves the mutagenic interconversion of the key active site residues of yeast CT domain with corresponding human residues. Specifically, we engineered a “humanized” yeast CT domain in which nine active site residues of the yeast CT domain (Pro-1760, Ile-1762, Met-1765, Glu-1919, Pro-1920, His-1925, Gln-2028, Met-2030, and Gly-2032) were replaced with the corresponding human ACC2 residues (Ser-1760, Leu-1762, Val-1765, Gln-1919, Ala-1920, Phe-1925, Glu-2028, Thr-2030, and Glu-2032). This humanized yeast CT domain (yCT-H9) exhibits an inhibitor sensitivity profile similar to that of human ACC while maintaining high recombinant expression yields and robust crystallizability. We also exploit these unique features to solve the crystal structure of yCT-H9 in complex with a human ACC2-selective small molecule inhibitor that failed to yield a crystal structure with wild-type yeast CT domain, thus offering key insights to guide future drug design efforts. The CT domain (residues 1476–2233) of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ACC was subcloned into the pET24d vector (Novagen) as before (17Zhang H. Tweel B. Li J. Tong L. Structure. 2004; 12: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This construct, yCT, was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus™ (DE3)-RIL, and transformants were selected on LB (Luria-Bertani) agar plates containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml). For large scale expression and purification, an Erlenmeyer flask containing 1 liter of LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with 25 ml of the overnight culture and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8, at which time isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (100 μm, final concentration) to induce expression, and the growth temperature was reduced to 20 °C and grown for 18 h. The cells were harvested and stored at −80 °C until further use. The CT domain (residues 1665–2458, 794 amino acids) of human ACC2 (GenBankTM accession number U89344) was custom-synthesized at DNA 2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) that contained a BamHI site at the 5′ end and a XhoI site at the C′ end. The resulting product was subcloned into pFastBac baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen), predigested with same enzymes to generate a C-terminal His-tagged protein. This recombinant construct, hCT, containing the gene for hACC2-CT domain was then transformed into DH10Bac™ E. coli competent cells to form an expression bacmid, which was then used for transfection into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) insect cells following the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) instructions. In vivo homologous recombination between the recombinant bacmid DNA and the viral DNA transferred the recombinant gene to the viral genome and generated recombinant virus harboring the gene for hACC2-CT domain (hCT). The recombinant viruses were purified by plaque assay and amplified following the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) instructions. Expression of hCT was performed by infecting 1 liter of Sf-21 cells at a cell density of 2 × 106 viable cells/ml and an multiplicity of infection of 0.5 in a serum-free insect cell medium (SF-900 III SFM, Invitrogen). Maximum expression of the recombinant protein was observed 48–72 h after infection, and the cells were harvested when their viability was 80–85%. Harvested cells were stored at −80 °C until further use. The humanized mutant of yeast CT domain was generated by replacing nine active site residues of yeast CT domain with corresponding human ACC2 CT domain residues (P1760S, I1762L, M1765V, E1919Q, P1920A, H1925F, Q2028E, M2030T, G2032E). This construct, yCT-H9, was custom-synthesized with codon optimization for E. coli expression at DNA 2.0 and cloned into the pET24d vector (Novagen) at NheI and XhoI sites. Construct yCT-H9 was expressed in E. coli following the same protocol as that for the wild-type yeast CT domain. Cells were harvested and resuspended in an appropriate volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm Tris-2-carboxyethyl phosphine, and 0.05% Triton X-100). The cell suspension was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking and then sonicated with a Branson ultrasonic disintegrator (VWR Scientific Products, Chicago, IL) for 2–4 min at 50% duty cycle. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 50 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was separated from the pellet. The soluble protein was purified by Ni2+-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow affinity (GE Healthcare) and anion exchange chromatography as described before (16Zhang H. Yang Z. Shen Y. Tong L. Science. 2003; 299: 2064-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated to 8.0 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.0 mm Tris-2-carboxyethyl phosphine. The sample was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The His6 tag was not removed for crystallization. Protein concentrations were determined using either the BCA assay system (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard or using absorbance at 280 nm. Direct analysis of protein intact mass measurements was conducted by LC-MS using a 0.3 × 100-mm Vydac C4 column (type 214MSS.310) and an Applied Biosystems QSTAR XL mass spectrometer as described elsewhere (20Rajamohan F. Harris M.S. Frisbie R.K. Hoth L.R. Geoghegan K.F. Valentine J.J. Reyes A.R. Landro J.A. Qiu X. Kurumbail R.G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 73: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) Crystals of the yeast CT domain were obtained at 22 °C by the vapor diffusion method as previously described (17Zhang H. Tweel B. Li J. Tong L. Structure. 2004; 12: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The reservoir solution contained 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5), 12% (w/v) PEG8000, 150 mm LiSO4, and 7.5% (v/v) glycerol. The protein was at 8.0 mg/ml and mixed 1:1 with reservoir solution. Structures with compounds were obtained by soaking apo crystals with 1.0 mm compound overnight in reservoir solution. The crystals were cryo-protected with the introduction of 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid propane. The humanized mutant, yCT-H9, crystallizes isomorphously to the wild-type structure. Data were collected at 17ID at the Advanced Photon Source (yCT-H9, compound 1) at beamline X29A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (yCT-H9, compound 2; yCT-H9, compound 3) and at 17BM at the Advanced Photon Source (yCT-H9, compound 4) (Fig. 1). Data were processed using D*Trek (21Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) or HKL-2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymology, Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. Vol. 276. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Structure factor generation, test set assignment, and various other reflection file manipulations were carried out using the programs available in the CCP4 suite of programs (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). All test set reflections were assigned to be identical to those in Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) entry 1W2X. Because all of the structures reported here are isomorphous to PDB code 1W2X, the structures were determined by rigid body refinement of the A, B, and C monomers of PDB code 1W2X followed by restrained refinement using the program REFMAC (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) using all available data. Final refinement was performed using the program autobuster (BUSTER, Version 2.8.0, Global Phasing Ltd., Cambridge, UK) interspersed with rounds of manual model building in the graphic program COOT (25Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17674) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab ACC-CT domain activity was assessed using a coupled-two phase system (organic/aqueous) measuring selective partition of [14C]acetylchloramphenicol into an organic layer. The conversion of radiolabeled malonyl CoA to acetyl CoA by the ACC-CT domain was coupled with acetylation of chloramphenicol by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Sigma C8413). The acetylchloramphenicol product was selectively partitioned into the organic phase scintillation fluid, with the radiolabeled malonyl CoA partitioning into the aqueous phase. The assay was run at room temperature in a final volume of 40 μl (384-well microtiter plate density) in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm DTT. The reaction contained 50 μm chloramphenicol, 0.3 units of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and 0.002 μCi of [malonyl-2-14C]malonyl coenzyme A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences NEC612025UC) at a final concentration of 1 μm (predetermined Km value for yeast ACC-CT). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the recombinant proteins in the presence of 1 mm biotin and then allowed to proceed for the indicated time. The assay was then terminated with 3 μl of 1 n HCL followed by 40 μl of MicroScintTM-E/butanol (1:1). Radioactivity of the upper organic phase was determined by top counting using a MicroBeta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer). The kinetic parameters for each protein were obtained by non-linear least-squares fitting to the initial velocity data. These experiments were performed using a photon technology international fluorimeter as described previously (17Zhang H. Tweel B. Li J. Tong L. Structure. 2004; 12: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, increasing concentrations of protein (yCT, yCT-H9, hCT) were titrated into a solution that initially contained 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 μm compound 1. The excitation wavelength was 350 nm, and the fluorescence emission was monitored between 390 and 430 nm. The observed fluorescence anisotropy of the compound as a function of protein concentration is fitted to a 1:1 binding model to extract the binding constant (Kd). For the competitive binding assay, increasing concentrations of compound 4 were titrated into a solution that contained 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 μm compound 1, and 8.0 μm concentrations of corresponding protein. The changes in intensity of fluorescence emission from protein-bound SYPRO orange dye as a function of temperature was monitored using iCycler iQ Real-time detection system (Bio-Rad). The system contains a heating/cooling device for accurate temperature control and a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector for simultaneous imaging of the fluorescence changes in the wells of the microplate. Briefly, 20 μl of each protein at 5 μm concentration with or without test compound (50 μm in DMSO) was mixed with 0.5 μl of 200× SYPRO orange solution (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), pipetted into separate wells of a 96-well PCR plate, and loaded into PCR machine. The temperature was ramped from 20 to 99 °C in 1 °C increments with a dwell time of 6 s. Excitation and emission wavelengths of SYPRO orange are 490 and 530 nm, respectively. The melting temperature (Tm), the point where the concentration of folded and unfolded protein are equal, was calculated by taking the first derivative of the change in fluorescence versus temperature. The negative first derivative of the fluorescence change (−dRFU/dT, where RFU is relative fluorescence units) for each protein was plotted against temperature, and the melting temperature was defined as the minimum in the −dRFU/dT curve. When accurate structures of protein-ligand complexes are available, Structure Based Drug Design has proven itself to be a valuable tool for lead discovery and optimization. However, because of difficulties with protein expression, purification, or post-translational modifications, crystallization of some authentic, native targets is quite challenging or impossible. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to utilize “surrogate” systems that closely resemble the native target. Examples include crystallization of target molecule from closely related species, single domains of multidomain proteins, or point mutants that enhance expression, purification, or crystallizability. We report here the development of an optimized surrogate Structure Based Drug Design system for human ACC2-CT domain. The yeast CT domain (yCT) has proven useful for the initial Structure Based Drug Design efforts against this target. However, as the selectivity of the lead series increased against the primary (human) enzyme, we observed a corresponding significant decrease in potency against the yeast enzyme. This loss of potency against the yeast enzyme eventually resulted in a complete loss of binding of the human specific compounds to the yeast CT domain crystal system. A biologically active recombinant CT domain (residues 1665–2458, 794 amino acids) of human ACC2 protein (hCT) bearing a His6 tag at the C-terminal end was expressed and purified (>10 mg of purified protein/liter of culture) using a baculovirus-insect cell system. Despite sharing 56% sequence identity with yCT (Fig. 2A), hCT has not yielded diffraction-quality crystals under several experimental crystallization conditions. To create an alternative, meaningful crystallization system for human-selective compounds, we sought to develop an optimized surrogate system in which the relevant amino acid residues at the active site of the yeast enzyme were mutated to match the corresponding residues of human enzyme ACC2. The active-site residues were identified based on the crystal structure of yeast ACC-CT domain (PDB code 1W2X) (16Zhang H. Yang Z. Shen Y. Tong L. Science. 2003; 299: 2064-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The CT domain is a homodimer; each molecule is made up of two sub domains (N and C domains) that are intimately associated with each other. The catalytic site is located at the dimer interface. We used each individual chain as the template to build the corresponding human CT domain homology model in MOE 2007 (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The CT domains of human ACC2 and yeast ACC share a sequence identity of 55.9%, and the binding site identity is 79% (Fig. 2A). The coarse homology model from MOE was further optimized in MAESTRO 8 (Schrodinger Inc., New York) and checked with Protein Report without any steric clash and other improbable structure features. Sequence comparison of the 35 residues within 6 Å of compound 1 in the yeast CT domain structure (Fig. 2B) identified only nine of these amino acids that differ between yACC-CT domain (Pro-1760, Ile-1762, Met-1765, Glu-1919, Pro-1920, His-1925, Gln-2028, Met-2030, and Gly-2032) and hACC2-CT domain (Ser-1760, Leu-1762, Val-1765, Gln-1919, Ala-1920, Phe-1925, Glu-2028, Thr-2030, and Glu-2032). We have mutated each of these nine amino acids in yCT to the corresponding residues in hCT, generating a humanized yeast CT domain (yCT-H9). We have used the E. coli expression system to produce wild-type yCT and the mutant yCT-H9 proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expected masses of purified proteins were in agreement with the theoretical mass for the demethylated (M−) or M− and singly acetylated proteins based on mass spectrometry (Fig. 3A). The final yields (>20 mg of purified protein per liter of culture) of yCT and yCT-H9 proteins were comparable (Fig. 3B). These recombinant proteins were used to determine the crystal structure in complex with ACC inhibitors 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 1). The enzymatic activities (specific activities) of these proteins were measured using a coupled-two phase (organic/aqueous) system. The radiolabeled malonyl CoA was converted into acetyl CoA by the CT domain and subsequently acetylated chloramphenicol by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The final product, [14C]acetylated chloramphenicol, which selectively partitioned into the organic layer, was measured as an indirect indication of CT domain activity. As shown in Table 2, all the CT domain variants were active, and the specific activities of yCT, hCT, and yCT-H9 were 2.31 ± 0.06, 4.07 ± 0.59, and 1.32 ± 0.10 pmol/min/mg, respectively. By comparison, hCT was slightly more active than yCT or yCT-H9.TABLE 2Activity and kinetic parameters of th"

Retrospective surveys are commonly used to collect mortality data in such populations, but require substantial resources and have important methodological limitations. We evaluated the feasibility of an alternative method for rapidly quantifying mortality (the informant method). The study objective was to assess the economic feasibility of the informant method.The informant method captures deaths through an exhaustive search for all deaths occurring in a population over a defined and recent recall period, using key community informants and next-of-kin of decedents. Between July and October 2008, we implemented and evaluated the informant method in: Kabul, Afghanistan; Mae La camp for Karen refugees, Thai-Burma border; Chiradzulu District, Malawi; and Lugufu and Mtabila refugee camps, Tanzania. We documented the time and cost inputs for the informant method in each site, and compared these with projections for hypothetical retrospective mortality surveys implemented in the same site with a 6 month recall period and with a 30 day recall period.The informant method was estimated to require an average of 29% less time inputs and 33% less monetary inputs across all four study sites when compared with retrospective surveys with a 6 month recall period, and 88% less time inputs and 86% less monetary inputs when compared with retrospective surveys with a 1 month recall period. Verbal autopsy questionnaires were feasible and efficient, constituting only 4% of total person-time for the informant method's implementation in Chiradzulu District.The informant method requires fewer resources and incurs less respondent burden. The method's generally impressive feasibility and the near real-time mortality data it provides warrant further work to develop the method given the importance of mortality measurement in such settings."
