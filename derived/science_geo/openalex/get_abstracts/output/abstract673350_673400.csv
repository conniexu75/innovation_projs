https://openalex.org/W3158768969,"Background There is a lack of population level data on risk factors, incidence and impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and their babies. The primary aim of this study was to describe the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in the UK compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2. Methods and findings We conducted a national, prospective cohort study of all hospitalized pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 01/03/2020 to 31/08/2020 using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System. Incidence rates were estimated using national maternity data. Overall, 1148 hospitalized women had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, 63% of which were symptomatic. The estimated incidence of hospitalization with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 2.0 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.9–2.2) and for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 1.2 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.1–1.4). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, women hospitalized with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be overweight or obese (adjusted OR 1.86, (95% CI 1.39–2.48) and aOR 2.07 (1.53–2.29)), to be of Black, Asian or Other minority ethnic group (aOR 6.24, (3.93–9.90), aOR 4.36, (3.19–5.95) and aOR 12.95, (4.93–34.01)), and to have a relevant medical comorbidity (aOR 1.83 (1.32–2.54)). Hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 57.67, (7.80–426.70)) but the absolute risk of poor outcomes was low. Cesarean births and neonatal unit admission were increased regardless of symptom status (symptomatic aOR 2.60, (1.97–3.42) and aOR 3.08, (1.99–4.77); asymptomatic aOR 2.02, (1.52–2.70) and aOR 1.84, (1.12–3.03)). The risks of stillbirth or neonatal death were not significantly increased, regardless of symptom status. Conclusions We have identified factors that increase the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. Clinicians can be reassured that the majority of women do not experience severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3158328319,"Sulfur isotope composition of organic tissues is a commonly used tool for gathering information about provenance and diet in archaeology and paleoecology. However, the lack of maps predicting sulfur isotope variations on the landscape limits the possibility to use this isotopic system in quantitative geographic assignments. We compiled a database of 2,680 sulfur isotope analyses in the collagen of archaeological human and animal teeth from 221 individual locations across Western Europe. We used this isotopic compilation and remote sensing data to apply a multivariate machine-learning regression, and to predict sulfur isotope variations across Western Europe. The resulting model shows that sulfur isotope patterns are highly predictable, with 65% of sulfur isotope variations explained using only 4 variables representing marine sulfate deposition and local geological conditions. We used this novel sulfur isoscape and existing strontium and oxygen isoscapes of Western Europe to apply triple isotopes continuous-surface probabilistic geographic assignments to assess the origin of a series of teeth from local animals and humans from Brittany. We accurately and precisely constrained the origin of these individuals to limited regions of Brittany. This approach is broadly transferable to studies in archaeology and paleoecology as illustrated in a companion paper (Colleter et al. 2021)."
https://openalex.org/W3157544919,"Background The emergence of a pandemic presents challenges and opportunities for healthcare, health promotion interventions, and overall improvement in healthcare seeking behaviour. This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on health knowledge, lifestyle, and healthcare seeking behaviour among residents of a resource-limited setting in Ghana. Methods This qualitative study adopted an exploratory design to collect data from 20 adult residents in the Cape Coast Metropolis using face-to-face in-depth interviews. Data collected were analysed thematically and statements from participants presented verbatim to illustrate the themes realised. Results Health knowledge has improved due to COVID–19 in terms of access to health information and increased understanding of health issues. There were reductions in risky health-related lifestyles (alcohol intake, sharing of personal items, and consumption of junk foods) while improvements were observed in healthy lifestyles such as regular physical exercise and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables. COVID–19 also positively impacted health seeking behaviour through increased health consciousness and regular check-ups. However, reduced healthcare utilization was prevalent. Conclusion The COVID–19 pandemic has presented a positive cue to action and helped improved health knowledge, lifestyle, and care seeking behaviour although existing health system constrains and low economic status reduced healthcare utilization. To improve health systems, health-related lifestyles and healthcare seeking behaviour as well as overall health outcomes even after the pandemic wades off, COVID–19 associated conscious and unconscious reforms should be systematically harnessed."
https://openalex.org/W3158836797,"Background Due to the dramatic measures accompanying isolation and the general uncertainty and fear associated with COVID-19, patients and relatives may be at high risk for adverse psychological outcomes. Until now there has been limited research focusing on the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors in COVID-19 patients and their relatives. The objective of our study was to assess psychological distress in COVID-19 patients and their relatives 30 days after hospital discharge. Methods In this prospective observational cohort study at two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals we included consecutive adult patients hospitalized between March and June 2020 for a proven COVID-19 and their relatives. Psychological distress was defined as symptoms of anxiety and/or depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), i.e., a score of ≥8 on the depression and/or anxiety subscale. We further evaluated symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), defined as a score of ≥1.5 on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Results Among 126 included patients, 24 (19.1%) had psychological distress and 10 (8.7%) had symptoms of PTSD 30 days after hospital discharge. In multivariate logistic regression analyses three factors were independently associated with psychological distress in patients: resilience (OR 0.82; 95%CI 0.71 to 0.94; p = 0.005), high levels of perceived stress (OR 1.21; 95%CI 1.06 to 1.38; p = 0.006) and low frequency of contact with relatives (OR 7.67; 95%CI 1.42 to 41.58; p = 0.018). The model showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92. Among 153 relatives, 35 (22.9%) showed symptoms of psychological distress, and 3 (2%) of PTSD. For relatives, resilience was negatively associated (OR 0.85; 95%CI 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.007), whereas perceived overall burden caused by COVID-19 was positively associated with psychological distress (OR 1.72; 95%CI 1.31 to 2.25; p&lt;0.001). The overall model also had good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.87. Conclusion A relevant number of COVID-19 patients as well as their relatives exhibited psychological distress 30 days after hospital discharge. These results might aid in development of strategies to prevent psychological distress in COVID-19 patients and their relatives."
https://openalex.org/W3157572888,"Diagnosis of any infectious disease is vital for opportune treatment and to prevent dissemination. RT-qPCR tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, are ideal in a hospital environment. However, mass testing requires cheaper and simpler tests, especially in settings that lack sophisticated machinery. The most common current diagnostic method is based on nasopharyngeal sample collection, RNA extraction, and RT-qPCR for amplification and detection of viral nucleic acids. Here, we show that samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM and in saliva can be used with or without RNA purification in an isothermal loop-mediated amplification (LAMP)-based assay, with 60-93% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection as compared to standard RT-qPCR tests. A series of simple modifications to standard RT-LAMP published methods to stabilize pH fluctuations due to salivary acidity resulted in a significant improvement in reliability, opening new avenues for efficient, low-cost testing of COVID-19 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3159466705,"Background It has been suggested that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may be used to identify those at greatest risk for severe COVID-19 illness. However, no study to date has examined the association between CRF and COVID-19. The objectives of this study were to determine whether CRF is independently associated with testing positive with or dying from COVID-19. Methods This is a prospective cohort study of 2,690 adults from the UK Biobank Study that were followed from March 16 th , 2020 to July 26 th , 2020. Participants who were tested for COVID-19 and had undergone CRF assessment were examined. CRF was estimated (eCRF) and categorized as low (&lt;20 th percentile), moderate (20 th to 80 th percentile) and high (≥80 th percentile) within sex and ten-year age groups (e.g. 50–60 years). Participants were classified as having COVID-19 if they tested positive (primarily PCR tests) at an in-patient or out-patient setting as of July 26, 2020. Participants were classified as having died from COVID-19 if the primary or underlying cause of death was listed ICD-10 codes U071 or U072 by June 30 th , 2020. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and a forward model building approach used to identify covariates. Findings There was no significant association between eCRF and testing positive for COVID-19. Conversely, individuals with moderate (aRR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.75) and high fitness (aRR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.85) had a significantly lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than those with low fitness. Conclusions While eCRF was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19, we observed a significant dose-response between having higher eCRF and a decreased risk of dying from COVID-19. This suggests that prior gains in CRF could be protective against dying from COVID-19 should someone develop the virus."
https://openalex.org/W3159118977,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, social and traditional media have disseminated predictions from experts and nonexperts about its expected magnitude. How accurate were the predictions of ‘experts’—individuals holding occupations or roles in subject-relevant fields, such as epidemiologists and statisticians—compared with those of the public? We conducted a survey in April 2020 of 140 UK experts and 2,086 UK laypersons; all were asked to make four quantitative predictions about the impact of COVID-19 by 31 Dec 2020. In addition to soliciting point estimates, we asked participants for lower and higher bounds of a range that they felt had a 75% chance of containing the true answer. Experts exhibited greater accuracy and calibration than laypersons, even when restricting the comparison to a subset of laypersons who scored in the top quartile on a numeracy test. Even so, experts substantially underestimated the ultimate extent of the pandemic, and the mean number of predictions for which the expert intervals contained the actual outcome was only 1.8 (out of 4), suggesting that experts should consider broadening the range of scenarios they consider plausible. Predictions of the public were even more inaccurate and poorly calibrated, suggesting that an important role remains for expert predictions as long as experts acknowledge their uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W3158214481,"Background Contact tracing is an important tool for suppressing COVID-19 but has been difficult to adapt to the conditions of a public health emergency. This study explored the experiences and perspectives of volunteer contact tracers in order to identify facilitators, challenges, and novel solutions for implementing COVID-19 contact tracing. Methods As part of a study to evaluate an emergently established volunteer contact tracing program for COVID-19 in New Haven, Connecticut, April-June 2020, we conducted focus groups with 36 volunteer contact tracers, thematically analyzed the data, and synthesized the findings using the RE-AIM implementation framework. Results To successfully reach cases and contacts, participants recommended identifying clients’ outreach preferences, engaging clients authentically, and addressing sources of mistrust. Participants felt that the effectiveness of successful isolation and quarantine was contingent on minimizing delays in reaching clients and on systematically assessing and addressing their nutritional, financial, and housing needs. They felt that successful adoption of a volunteer-driven contact tracing model depended on the ability to recruit self-motivated contact tracers and provide rapid training and consistent, supportive supervision. Participants noted that implementation could be enhanced with better management tools, such as more engaging interview scripts, user-friendly data management software, and protocols for special situations and populations. They also emphasized the value of coordinating outreach efforts with other involved providers and agencies. Finally, they believed that long-term maintenance of a volunteer-driven program requires monetary or educational incentives to sustain participation. Conclusions This is one of the first studies to qualitatively examine implementation of a volunteer-run COVID-19 contact tracing program. Participants identified facilitators, barriers, and potential solutions for improving implementation of COVID-19 contact tracing in this context. These included standardized communication skills training, supportive supervision, and peer networking to improve implementation, as well as greater cooperation with outside agencies, flexible scheduling, and volunteer incentives to promote sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W3159590721,"China's carbon emission performance has significant regional heterogeneity. Identified the sources of carbon emission performance differences and the influence of various driving factors in China's eight economic regions accurately is the premise for realizing China's carbon emission reduction goals. Based on the provincial panel data from 2005 to 2017, the super-efficiency SBM model and Malmquist model are constructed in this paper to measure regional carbon emission performance's static and dynamic changes. After that, the Theil index is used to distinguish the impact of inter-regional and intra-regional differences on different regions' carbon emissions performance. Finally, by introducing the Tobit model, the effect of various driving factors on carbon emission performance differences is analyzed quantitatively. The results show that: (1) There are significant differences in different regions' carbon emission performance, but the overall carbon emission performance presents an upward fluctuation trend. Malmquist index decomposition results show substantial differences in technology progress index and technology efficiency index in different regions, leading to significant carbon emission performance differences. (2) Overall, inter-regional differences contribute the most to the overall carbon emission performance, up to more than 80%. Among them, the inter-regional and intra-regional differences in ERMRYR contributed significantly. (3) Through Tobit regression analysis, it is found that residents' living standards, urbanization level, ecological development degree, and industrial structure positively affect carbon emission performance. On the contrary, energy intensity presents an apparent negative correlation on carbon emission performance. Therefore, to improve the carbon emission performance, we should put forward targeted suggestions according to the characteristics of different regional development stages, regional carbon emission differences, and influencing driving factors."
https://openalex.org/W3158423867,"The social media milieu in which we are enmeshed has substantive impacts on our beliefs and perceptions. Recent work has established that this can play a role in influencing understanding of, and reactions to, public health information. Twitter, in particular, appears to play a substantive role in the public health information ecosystem. From July 25 th , 2020 to November 15 th , 2020, we collected weekly tweets related to COVID19 keywords and assessed their networks, patterns and properties. Our analyses revealed the dominance of a handful of individual accounts as central structuring agents in the networks of tens of thousands of tweets and retweets, and thus millions of views, related to specific COVID19 keywords. These few individual accounts and the content of their tweets, mentions, and retweets are substantially overrepresented in terms of public exposure to, and thus interaction with, critical elements of public health information in the pandemic. Here we report on one particularly striking aspect of our dataset: the prominent position of @realdonaldtrump in Twitter networks related to four key terms of the COVID19 pandemic in 2020."
https://openalex.org/W3157123826,"Background Caesarean sections (CS) continue to increase worldwide. Multiple and complex factors are contributing to the increase, including non-clinical factors related to individual women, families and their interactions with health providers. This global qualitative evidence synthesis explores women’s preferences for mode of birth and factors underlying preferences for CS. Methods Systematic database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO) were conducted in December 2016 and updated in May 2019 and February 2021. Studies conducted across all resource settings were eligible for inclusion, except those from China and Taiwan which have been reported in a companion publication. Phenomena of interest were opinions, views and perspectives of women regarding preferences for mode of birth, attributes of CS, societal and cultural beliefs about modes of birth, and right to choose mode of birth. Thematic synthesis of data was conducted. Confidence in findings was assessed using GRADE-CERQual. Results We included 52 studies, from 28 countries, encompassing the views and perspectives of pregnant women, non-pregnant women, women with previous CS, postpartum women, and women’s partners. Most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries and published between 2011 and 2021. Factors underlying women preferences for CS had to do mainly with strong fear of pain and injuries to the mother and child during labour or birth (High confidence) , uncertainty regarding vaginal birth (High confidence) , and positive views or perceived advantages of CS (High confidence) . Women who preferred CS expressed resoluteness about it, but there were also many women who had a clear preference for vaginal birth and those who even developed strategies to keep their birth plans in environments that were not supportive of vaginal births (High confidence) . The findings also identified that social, cultural and personal factors as well as attributes related to health systems impact on the reasons underlying women preferences for various modes of birth (High confidence) . Conclusions A wide variety of factors underlie women’s preferences for CS in the absence of medical indications. Major factors contributing to perceptions of CS as preferable include fear of pain, uncertainty with vaginal birth and positive views on CS. Interventions need to address these factors to reduce unnecessary CS."
https://openalex.org/W3157171676,"Adolescence offers a window of opportunity during which improvements in health behaviours could benefit long-term health, and enable preparation for parenthood-albeit a long way off, passing on good health prospects to future children. This study was carried out to evaluate whether an educational intervention, which engages adolescents in science, can improve their health literacy and behaviours. A cluster-randomised controlled trial of 38 secondary schools in England, UK was conducted. The intervention (LifeLab) drew on principles of education, psychology and public health to engage students with science for health literacy, focused on the message ""Me, my health and my children's health"". The programme comprised: • Professional development for teachers. • A 2-3 week module of work for 13-14-year-olds. • A ""hands-on"" practical health science day visit to a dedicated facility in a university teaching hospital. Data were collected from 2929 adolescents (aged 13-14 years) at baseline and 2487 (84.9%) at 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome was change in theoretical health literacy from pre- to 12 months post- intervention. This study is registered (ISRCTN71951436) and the trial status is complete. Participation in the LifeLab educational intervention was associated with an increase in the students' standardised total theoretical health literacy score (adjusted difference between groups = 0.27 SDs (95%CI = 0.12, 0.42)) at 12-month follow-up. There was an indication that intervention participants subsequently judged their own lifestyles more critically than controls, with fewer reporting their behaviours as healthy (53.4% vs. 59.5%; adjusted PRR = 0.94 [0.87, 1.01]). We conclude that experiencing LifeLab led to improved health literacy in adolescents and that they demonstrated a move towards a more critical judgement of health behaviour 12 months after the intervention. Further work is needed to examine whether this leads to sustained behaviour change, and whether other activities are needed to support this change."
https://openalex.org/W3157535247,"Previous work suggest a positive skeletal muscle effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on skeletal muscle characteristics This study aimed to quantify any continued positive effect of HRT even after a sustained hiatus in treatment, controlling for two key muscle modulation hormones: Estradiol (E2) and Tri-iodo-thyronine (T3).In 61 untrained women (18-78yrs) stratified as pre-menopausal, post-menopausal without (No_HRT) and post-menopausal with (Used_HRT) HRT history, body composition, physical activity, serum E2 and T3 were assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, Baecke questionnaire and ELISA. Gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and tibialis anterior (TA) electromyographic profiles (mean power frequency (mPowerF)), isometric plantar-flexion (PF) and dorsi-flexion (DF) maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), rate of torque development (RTD), isokinetic MVC and muscle volume, were assessed using surface electromyography, dynamometry and ultrasonography. Muscle quality was quantified as MVC per unit muscle size. E2 and E2:T3 ratio were significantly lower in postmenopausal participants, and were positively correlated with RTD even after controlling for adiposity and/or age. Pre-menopausal females had greater MVC in 8/8 PF and 2/5 DF (23.7-98.1%; P<0.001-0.049) strength measures compared to No_HRT, but only 6/8 PF (17.4-42.3%; P<0.001-0.046) strength measures compared to Used_HRT. Notably, Used_HRT had significant higher MVC in 7 PF MVC (30.0%-37.7%; P = 0.006-0.031) measures than No_HRT, while premenopausal and Used_HRT had similar uncorrected muscle size or quality. In addition, this cross-sectional data suggest an annual reduction in GM muscle volume corrected for intra-muscular fat by 1.3% in No_HRT and only 0.5% in Used_HRT.Even years after cessation of the therapy, a history of HRT is positively associated with negating the expected post-menopausal drop in muscle quantity and quality. Whilst mPowerF did not differ between groups, our work highlights positive associations between RTD against E2 and E2:T3. Notwithstanding our study limitation of single time point for blood sampling, our work is the first to illustrate an HRT attenuation of ageing-related decline in RTD. We infer from these data that high E2, even in the absence of high T3, may help maintain muscle contractile speed and quality. Thus our work is the first to points to markedly larger physiological reserves in women with a past history of HRT."
https://openalex.org/W3157841686,"Cerebral organoids generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are unique in their ability to recapitulate human-specific neurodevelopmental events. They are capable of modeling the human brain and its cell composition, including human-specific progenitor cell types; ordered laminar compartments; and both cell-specific transcriptional signatures and the broader telencephalic transcriptional landscape. The serine/threonine kinase, GSK3β, plays a critical role in neurodevelopment, controlling processes as varied as neurogenesis, morphological changes, polarization, and migration. In the generation of cerebral organoids, inhibition of GSK3β at low doses has been used to increase organoid size and decrease necrotic core. However, little is known of the effects of GSK3β inhibition on organoid development. Here, we demonstrate that while low dose of GSK3β inhibitor CHIR 99021 increases organoid size, higher dose actually reduces organoid size; with the highest dose arresting organoid growth. To examine the mechanisms that may contribute to the phenotypic size differences observed in these treatment groups, we show that low dose of CHIR 99021 increases cell survival, neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal migration. A higher dose, however, decreases not only apoptosis but also proliferation, and arrests neural differentiation, enriching the pool of neuroepithelial cells, and decreasing the pools of early neuronal progenitors and neurons. These results reveal new mechanisms of the pleiotropic effects of GSK3β during organoid development, providing essential information for the improvement of organoid production and ultimately shedding light on the mechanisms of embryonic brain development."
https://openalex.org/W3159043043,"Recent studies have reported disproportionate weight gain associated with integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) initiation in antiretroviral therapy(ART)-naive people with HIV (PWH), particularly among black women. We investigated if HIV-positive AGEhIV participants with suppressed viremia switching to INSTI-containing ART experienced more weight gain compared to HIV-positive virally-suppressed non-switching and HIV-negative controls.In the AGEhIV cohort, standardized weight measurements were performed biennially. Participants switching to INSTI-containing ART were 1:2:2 propensity score-matched with controls by age, gender, ethnicity and body mass index. Mean weight changes and proportions experiencing >5% or >10% weight gain were compared between study-groups using linear mixed-effects models and logistic regression, respectively.121 INSTI-switching participants and 242 participants from each of the control groups were selected. Across groups, median age was 53-55 years, 83-91% were male and 88-93% white. Mean weight change after switch among INSTI-switching participants was +0.14 kg/year (95%CI -0.25, +0.54) and similar among HIV-positive [+0.13 kg/year (95%CI +0.07, +0.33; P = .9)] and HIV-negative [+0.18 kg/year (95%CI 0.00, +0.37; P = .9)] controls. Weight gain >5% occurred in 28 (23.1%) INSTI-switching, 38 HIV-positive (15.7%, P = .085) and 32 HIV-negative controls (13.2%, P = .018). Weight gain >10% was rare.Switching to INSTI-containing ART in our cohort of predominantly white men on long-term ART was not associated with greater mean weight gain, but >5% weight gain was more common than in controls. These results suggest that not all, but only certain, PWH may be particularly prone to gain a clinically significant amount of weight as a result of switching to INSTI."
https://openalex.org/W3159523945,"Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) imposes a major health burden throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the globe. Unresponsive cases are common phenomena occurred upon exposure to the standard drugs. Therefore, rapid detection, prognosis and classification of the disease are crucial for selecting the proper treatment modality. Using machine learning (ML) techniques, this study aimed to detect unresponsive cases of ACL, caused by Leishmania tropica , which will consequently be used for a more effective treatment modality. This study was conducted as a case-control setting. Patients were selected in a major ACL focus from both unresponsive and responsive cases. Nine unique and relevant features of patients with ACL were selected. To categorize the patients, different classifier models such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), learning vector quantization (LVQ) and multipass LVQ were applied and compared for this supervised learning task. Comparison of the receiver operating characteristic graphs (ROC) and confusion plots for the above models represented that MLP was a fairly accurate prediction model to solve this problem. The overall accuracy in terms of sensitivity, specificity and area under ROC curve (AUC) of MLP classifier were 87.8%, 90.3%, 86% and 0.88%, respectively. Moreover, the duration of the skin lesion was the most influential feature in MLP classifier, while gender was the least. The present investigation demonstrated that MLP model could be utilized for rapid detection, accurate prognosis and effective treatment of unresponsive patients with ACL. The results showed that the major feature affecting the responsiveness to treatments is the duration of the lesion. This novel approach is unique and can be beneficial in developing diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic measures against the disease. This attempt could be a preliminary step towards the expansion of ML application in future directions."
https://openalex.org/W3157657353,"Background In the United States, mothers’ employment status and occupation are related to breastfeeding. However, it is unclear whether not working leads to longer breastfeeding duration even when compared to professional/managerial jobs, which tend to accommodate breastfeeding better than service/manual labor jobs. Furthermore, occupation and breastfeeding are racially patterned, and it is possible that race could moderate the relationships between mother’s work and breastfeeding. Methods Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we modeled breastfeeding duration based on mother’s employment/occupation (not working, professional/managerial work, or service/labor work) during the first 6 months postpartum, as well as mother’s race (White, Black or other) and other potential confounders. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression models and tested an interaction between employment/occupation type and race. Predictive margins were used to compare breastfeeding duration among subgroups. Results Mothers working in service/labor occupations had the shortest breastfeeding duration of the three employment/occupation groups, and there was no significant difference in duration between not working and professional/managerial occupation. White mothers had longer breastfeeding duration than Black mothers on average. When we included an interaction between employment/occupation and race, we found that among White mothers, non-working mothers breastfed the longest, while mothers in service/labor work breastfed for the shortest duration, but among Black mothers, mothers in professional/managerial work breastfed for longer than mothers in the other two work categories. Discussion Race moderated the relationship between employment status/occupation type and breastfeeding such that, for White mothers, not working was the most advantageous circumstance for breastfeeding, in line with traditional work-family conflict theory. In contrast, for Black mothers, professional/managerial work was the most advantageous circumstance. These findings support the idea of the Market-Family Matrix, which allows that different work scenarios may be more or less advantageous for parenting behaviors like breastfeeding, depending on mothers’ circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3157891814,"Using a nationally-representative, cross-sectional cohort, we examined nutritional markers of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in adults via machine learning.A total of 16429 men and non-pregnant women ≥ 20 years of age were analysed from five consecutive cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Cohorts from years 2013-2016 (n = 6673) was used for external validation. Undiagnosed type 2 diabetes was determined by a negative response to the question ""Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have diabetes?"" and a positive glycaemic response to one or more of the three diagnostic tests (HbA1c > 6.4% or FPG >125 mg/dl or 2-hr post-OGTT glucose > 200mg/dl). Following comprehensive literature search, 114 potential nutritional markers were modelled with 13 behavioural and 12 socio-economic variables. We tested three machine learning algorithms on original and resampled training datasets built using three resampling methods. From this, the derived 12 predictive models were validated on internal- and external validation cohorts. Magnitudes of associations were gauged through odds ratios in logistic models and variable importance in others. Models were benchmarked against the ADA diabetes risk test.The prevalence of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes was 5.26%. Four best-performing models (AUROC range: 74.9%-75.7%) classified 39 markers of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes; 28 via one or more of the three best-performing non-linear/ensemble models and 11 uniquely by the logistic model. They comprised 14 nutrient-based, 12 anthropometry-based, 9 socio-behavioural, and 4 diet-associated markers. AUROC of all models were on a par with ADA diabetes risk test on both internal and external validation cohorts (p>0.05).Models performed comparably to the chosen benchmark. Novel behavioural markers such as the number of meals not prepared from home were revealed. This approach may be useful in nutritional epidemiology to unravel new associations with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3159418761,"The applicability of mobile digital technology to promote clinical care of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is gaining increased interest as part of the implementation of patient-centered approaches. We aimed at assessing adherence to a smartphone-based e-diary, which was designed to collect patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Secondary objectives were to evaluate the construct and predictive validity of e-diary derived PROs and to explore the various factors that were associated with changes in PROs over time.In this observational cohort study patients downloaded an MS tailored e-diary into their personal smartphones. Report of PROs was enquired once monthly for a period of one year through a smartphone-based application, using previously validated tools. An e-diary derived bodily function summary score (eBF) was defined as the sum of scores depicting vision, limbs function, pain, bowl/ bladder dysfunction, pseudobulbar affect and spasticity. Multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance were used to determine the association between PROs, clinician-reported outcomes (ClinROs) of disease activity and quality of life (QoL). Regression coefficient analysis was used to compare the slope of change in eBF before and after a relapse.97 pwMS downloaded the e-diary [Female: 64 (66%), EDSS 3.4±2.1]. 76 patients (78%) completed the 12-month study period. 53 patients (55%) submitted ≥75% of requested surveys. Anxiety was negatively associated with adherence to periodic PROs assessments by the e-diary. E-diary derived PROs were significantly correlated with corresponding functional system scores (0.38< r <0.8, P<0.001). eBF score significantly predicted QoL (β = -0.36, P = 0.001) while EDSS did not. Change in eBF score over time was independently associated with the occurrence of an MS relapse (F = 4.4, P = 0.04), anxiety (F = 6.4, P = 0.01) and depression (F = 5.1, P = 0.03). Individual regression slopes of eBF scores were significantly higher pre-relapse than post-relapse (3.0±3.3 vs. -0.8±2.0, P = 0.007).Adherence of pwMS to recording in an e-diary collecting PROs was high. Changes in e-diary derived PROs over time predict clinical MS relapses on the group level and thus carry the potential of usage in clinical research as well as for improved MS care in real world setting."
https://openalex.org/W3159934005,"Although health workers have been trained to provide post-partum family planning (PPFP), uptake remains low in Uganda. An important reason is that women want the agreement of their partner, who is often absent at the time of delivery. In order to address this, we aimed to understand the views of couples and explore barriers and facilitators to implementation of antenatal couples' counselling on PPFP in Uganda.We conducted individual interviews with a purposive sample of 12 postpartum and 3 antenatal couples; and 34 focus groups with a total of 323 participants (68 adolescent women, 83 women aged 20-49, 79 men, 93 health workers) in four contrasting communities (urban and rural) in South-West and Central Uganda. These were recorded, transcribed, translated, and analysed thematically.Although most participants felt that it is important for partners to discuss family planning, half of the couples were unaware of each other's views on contraception. Most had similar views on motivation to use family planning but not on preferred contraceptive methods. Most liked the idea of antenatal couples' counselling on PPFP. The main barrier was the reluctance of men to attend antenatal clinics (ANC) in health facilities. Respondents felt that Village Health Teams (VHTs) could provide initial counselling on PPFP in couples' homes (with telephone support from health workers, if needed) and encourage men to attend ANC. Suggested facilitators for men to attend ANC included health workers being more welcoming, holding ANC clinics at weekends and ""outreach"" clinics (in rural villages far from health facilities).Antenatal couples' counselling has the potential to facilitate agreement PPFP, but some men are reluctant to attend antenatal clinics. Counselling at home by VHTs as well as simple changes to the organisation of antenatal clinics, could make it possible to deliver antenatal couples' counselling on PPFP."
https://openalex.org/W3157158474,"The pouched lamprey, Geotria australis Gray, 1851, has long been considered monotypic in the Geotriidae family with a wide southern temperate distribution across Australasia and South America. Recent studies have provided molecular and morphological evidence for a second Geotria species in South America; Geotria macrostoma (Burmeister, 1868). The aim of this study was to determine morphometric and physical characteristics of adult G. macrostoma that further differentiate this re-instated species of Geotriidae from G. australis. The diagnostic features discriminating immature adult G. macrostoma from G. australis when entering fresh water, are distinct differences in dentition, oral papillae and fimbriae counts and differences in coloration. In addition, G. macrostoma display greater growth of the prebranchial region and oral disc and has a deeper body depth and higher condition factor. All current ecological knowledge of the genus Geotria is based on Australasian populations, which may not be applicable to G. macrostoma. To ensure the conservation and protection of the Patagonian lamprey as a re-identified species, further investigations are needed to understand its life history, biology and ecology throughout its range."
https://openalex.org/W3157680403,"This study aimed to examine the association between clinically diagnosed chorioamnionitis and failed conversion of epidural labor analgesia to cesarean delivery anesthesia.This retrospective, single-center cohort study, conducted in a university hospital, enrolled term parturients undergoing emergency cesarean section after induction of epidural labor analgesia between September 2015 and May 2019. For the purpose of this study, all cases were re-examined to ensure that they fulfilled the criteria of chorioamnionitis, regardless of the actual indication for cesarean section proposed by obstetricians at the time of application. The primary outcome was failure of conversion of epidural labor analgesia to cesarean delivery anesthesia. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between chorioamnionitis and failure of anesthesia for cesarean section.Among the 180 parturients reviewed, 58 (43.9%) fulfilled the criteria for chorioamnionitis. Failure of epidural conversion in the chorioamnionitis (+) group was significantly higher than in the chorioamnionitis (-) group (46.6% [27/58] vs. 18.9% [14/74], crude odds ratio = 3.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.7-8.3). After adjustment for potential confounders (age, body mass index, multiparity, and duration for epidural labor analgesia), chorioamnionitis was found to be associated with failure of anesthesia for cesarean sections (adjusted odds ratio = 3.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.6-8.4).Chorioamnionitis is associated with the failed conversion of epidural labor analgesia to cesarean delivery anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W3158405220,"The primary plant cell wall is a complex matrix composed of interconnected polysaccharides including cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. Changes of this dynamic polysaccharide system play a critical role during plant cell development and differentiation. A better understanding of cell wall architectures can provide insight into the plant cell development. In this study, a Raman spectroscopic imaging approach was developed to visualize the distribution of plant cell wall polysaccharides. In this approach, Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS through self-assembled silver nanoparticles) was combined with Raman labels (4-Aminothiophenol. 4ATP) and targeted enzymatic hydrolysis to improve the sensitivity, specificity, and throughput of the Raman imaging technique, and to reveal the distribution of pectin and its co-localization with xyloglucan inside onion epidermal cell (OEC) wall. This technique significantly decreased the required spectral acquisition time. The resulted Raman spectra showed a high Raman signal. The resulted Raman images successfully revealed and characterized the pectin distribution and its co-localization pattern with xyloglucan in OEC wall."
https://openalex.org/W3158702377,"Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) can provide irrigation water and overcome water scarcity in agriculture. Removal of potentially present plant pathogens during MAR is essential to prevent crop diseases. We studied the die-off of three plant pathogenic bacteria in water microcosms with natural or filtered tile drainage water (TDW) at 10 and 25°C and with natural anoxic aquifer water (AW) at 10°C from a MAR site. These bacteria were: Ralstonia solanacearum (bacterial wilt), and the soft rot Pectobacteriaceae (SRP) Dickeya solani and Pectobacterium carotovorum sp. carotovorum (soft rot, blackleg). They are present in surface waters and cause destructive crop diseases worldwide which have been linked to contaminated irrigation water. Nevertheless, little is known about the survival of the SRP in aqueous environments and no study has investigated the persistence of R . solanacearum under natural anoxic conditions. We found that all bacteria were undetectable in 0.1 mL samples within 19 days under oxic conditions in natural TDW at 10°C, using viable cell counting, corresponding to 3-log 10 reduction by die-off. The SRP were no longer detected within 6 days at 25°C, whereas R . solanacearum was detectable for 25 days. Whereas in anoxic natural aquifer water at 10°C, the bacterial concentrations declined slower and the detection limit was reached within 56 days. Finally, we modelled the inactivation curves with a modified Weibull model that can simulate different curve shapes such as shoulder phenomena in the beginning and long tails reflecting persistent bacterial populations. The non-linear model was shown to be a reliable tool to predict the die-off of the analysed plant pathogenic bacteria, suggesting its further application to other pathogenic microorganisms in the context of microbial risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3158817900,"Health care out-of-pocket payments can create barriers to access or lead to financial distress. Out-of-pocket expenditure is often driven by outpatient pharmaceuticals. In this nationwide register study, we study the causal relationship between an increase in patients’ pharmaceutical expenses and financial difficulties by exploiting a natural experiment design arising from a 2017 reform, which introduced higher co-payments for type 2 diabetes medicines in Finland. With difference-in-differences estimation, we analyze whether the reform increased the use of social assistance, a last-resort financial aid. We found that after the reform the share of social assistance recipients increased more among type 2 diabetes patients than among a patient group not affected by the co-payment increase, suggesting the reform increased the use of social assistance among those subject to it. The results indicate that increases in patients’ pharmaceutical expenses can lead to serious financial difficulties even in countries with a comprehensive social security system."
https://openalex.org/W3158838096,"In academia, many institutions use journal article publication productivity for making decisions on tenure and promotion, funding grants, and rewarding stellar scholars. Although non-alphabetical sequencing of article coauthoring by the spelling of surnames signals the extent to which a scholar has contributed to a project, many disciplines in academia follow the norm of alphabetical ordering of coauthors in journal publications. By assessing business academic publications, this study investigates the hypothesis that author alphabetical ordering disincentivizes teamwork and reduces the overall quality of scholarship.To address our objectives, we accessed data from 21,353 articles published over a 20-year period across the four main business subdisciplines. The articles selected are all those published by the four highest-ranked journals (in each year) and four lower-ranked journals (in each year) for accounting, business technology, marketing, and organizational behavior. Poisson regression and binary logistic regression were utilized for hypothesis testing.This study finds that, although team size among business scholars is increasing over time, alphabetical ordering as a convention in journal article publishing disincentivizes author teamwork. This disincentive results in fewer authors per publication than for publications using contribution-based ordering of authors. Importantly, article authoring teamwork is related to article quality. Specifically, articles written by a single author typically are of lesser quality than articles published by coauthors, but the number of coauthors exhibits decreasing returns to scale-coauthoring teams of one to three are positively related to high-quality articles, but larger teams are not. Alphabetical ordering itself, however, is positively associated with quality even though it inhibits teamwork, but journal article coauthoring has a greater impact on article quality than does alphabetical ordering.These findings have important implications for academia. Scholars respond to incentives, yet alphabetical ordering of journal article authors conflicts with what is beneficial for the progress of academic disciplines. Based on these findings, we recommend that, to drive the highest-quality research, teamwork should be incentivized-all fields should adopt a contribution-based journal article author-ordering convention and avoid author ordering based upon the spelling of surnames. Although this study was undertaken using articles from business journals, its findings should generalize across all academia."
https://openalex.org/W3157388970,"Background and objectives The burden of dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne pathogen, remains difficult to assess due to misdiagnosis and underreporting. Moreover, the large proportion of asymptomatic dengue cases impairs comprehensive assessment of its epidemiology even where effective surveillance systems are in place. We conducted a prospective community-based study to assess the incidence of symptomatic dengue cases in Zapopan and neighboring municipalities in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Methods Healthy subjects aged 6 months to 50 years living in households located in the Zapopan and neighboring municipalities were enrolled for a 24-month follow-up study (NCT02766088). Serostatus was determined at enrolment and weekly contacts were conducted via phone calls and home visits. Participants had to report any febrile episode lasting for at least two days. Suspected dengue cases were tested by reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), detection of non-structural protein 1 (NS1), anti-DENV immunoglobulin G and M (IgG and IgM) assays. Results A total of 350 individuals from 87 households were enrolled. The overall seroprevalence of anti-DENV IgG at enrolment was 19.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.5–25.6) with the highest seroprevalence rate observed in the adult group. Over the 27-month study period from July 2016 to September 2018, a total of 18 suspected dengue cases were reported. Four cases were confirmed by RT-qPCR and serotyped as DENV-1. A fifth case was confirmed by the NS1 assay. The 13 remaining suspected cases were tested negative by these assays. Based on the 5 virologically confirmed cases, symptomatic dengue incidence proportion of 1.4% (95%CI 0.5–3.8) was estimated. No severe cases or hospitalizations occurred during the study. Conclusion Community-based active surveillance was shown as efficient to detect symptomatic dengue cases. Clinical trial registration NCT02766088 ."
https://openalex.org/W3157611622,"In contrast to mammals, lower vertebrates are capable of extraordinary myocardial regeneration thanks to the ability of their cardiomyocytes to undergo transient dedifferentiation and proliferation. Somatic cells can be temporarily reprogrammed to a proliferative, dedifferentiated state through forced expression of Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM). Here, we aimed to induce transient reprogramming of mammalian cardiomyocytes in vitro utilising an OSKM-encoding non-integrating vector. Reprogramming factor expression in postnatal rat and mouse cardiomyocytes triggered rapid but limited cell dedifferentiation. Concomitantly, a significant increase in cell viability, cell cycle related gene expression and Ki67 positive cells was observed consistent with an enhanced cell cycle activation. The transient nature of this partial reprogramming was confirmed as cardiomyocyte-specific cell morphology, gene expression and contractile activity were spontaneously recovered by day 15 after viral transduction. This study provides the first evidence that adenoviral OSKM delivery can induce partial reprogramming of postnatal cardiomyocytes. Therefore, adenoviral mediated transient reprogramming could be a novel and feasible strategy to recapitulate the regenerative mechanisms of lower vertebrates."

Sri Lanka is reportedly shown to have better maternal health statistics and studies on quality improvement are lacking in this unique population. We aim to describe healthcare providers' perceptions and women's expectations, perceptions and their gaps in service provision regarding RMC in Sri Lanka.A descriptive cross-sectional study with a mixed-methods approach comprising of qualitative component followed by a quantitative component will be conducted in Castle Street Hospital for Women (CSHW) and De Soysa Hospital for Women (DSHW), Colombo, Sri Lanka. Healthcare providers (HCP- doctors, nurses and midwives) and vaginally delivered postnatal women (in postnatal wards and postnatal well-baby clinics) will be recruited through convenience sampling. In-depth interviews will be conducted with each of the four categories. Thematic analysis will be adopted to analyze qualitative data and the findings will further be used to improve the quantitative phase questionnaires. Self-administered questionnaire will be administered to a 378 vaginally delivered postnatal women [quota sampling across ten wards], exploring demographic details, and maternal opinion on various aspects of RMC. Locally validated Women's Perceptions of RMC tool (WP-RMC) will also be used to measure the level of RMC among these postnatal women along with the questionnaire 01. Qualitative findings will be used for cognitive validation of the WP-RMC into the Sri Lankan setting.This study will explore HCP's and women's expectations, perceptions and their gaps in service provision regarding RMC in two maternity hospitals in Sri Lanka.

Sociodemographic and pathologic factors have been studied widely in western populations but are very limited in this region. This study is the first to report breast cancer survival and investigate prognostic factors associated with its survival in the UAE.This is a retrospective cohort study involving 988 patients who were diagnosed and histologically confirmed with breast cancer between January 2008 and December 2012 at Tawam hospital, Al Ain, UAE. Patient were followed from the date of initial diagnosis until the date of death from any cause, lost-to-follow up or the end of December 2018. The primary outcome is overall survival (OS). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curve along with the 2- and 5-year survivals. Different group of patients categorized according to prognostic factors were compared using the log-rank test. Multiple Cox proportional hazards models was used to examine the impact of several prognostic factors on the overall survival.The median study follow-up was 35 months. Of the 988 patients, 62 had died during their follow-up, 56 were lost to follow-up and 870 were still alive at the end of the study. The average age of patients was 48 years. The majority of patients presented to the hospital with grade II or III, 24% with at least stage 3 and 9.2% had metastasis. The 2-year and 5-year survivals were estimated to 97% and 89% respectively. Results of the multiple Cox proportional hazard model show that tumor grade, and stage of cancer at presentation are jointly significantly associated with survival.The 2- and 5-year survival are within the norms compared to other countries. Significant clinical and pathological prognostic factors associated with survival were tumor grade, and the stage of cancer at presentation."
https://openalex.org/W3159741702,"Advances in the treatment of congenital heart disease (CHD) have increased life expectancy, entailing medical surveillance for a considerable number of adolescents and young adults with CHD for issues arising in areas such as sexual health. This study aimed to assess the sexual knowledge and the needs for sexual health education among this group. The participants comprised 53 young adult outpatients (27 males, median age: 23 years) who had undergone surgical interventions (median: 3 times) for CHD. The Knowledge related to Safe Sex Practice scale (KSSP), an assessment tool containing 15 questions on sexual knowledge, was administered, and the rates of correct answers for each item and the overall scale were compared with the age and sex of a control group (n = 164). The overall mean KSSP score of the participant group (10.5 ± 1.8) was significantly lower than that of the control group (11.1 ± 1.9, p = .035). The KSSP scores of the participants with low peripheral oxygen saturation (SaO2 < 95%) were significantly lower (9.77 ± 1.85) than those with normal SaO2 (11.06 ± 1.85, p = .009). Regarding sexual health education, the participants reported receiving information about contraception as more important than other areas of sexual health. The rate of incorrect answers was higher for questions regarding natural ways of contraception utilizing infertile periods in the menstrual cycle. Based on an informed understanding of those with CHD, healthcare providers in this field should develop customized sexual health education for adolescents and young adults with CHD and implement customized sexual health education, including effective contraception methods."
https://openalex.org/W3157215001,"To prospectively estimate the age of cigarette initiation among young adults (18-24 years old) who were never cigarette users at their first wave of adult study participation overall, by sex, and by race/ethnicity given recent increases in cigarette initiation occurring in young adulthood.Secondary analyses were conducted using the PATH restricted-use adult datasets among young adult never users of cigarettes in waves 1-3 (2013-2016) with outcomes followed-up in waves 2-4 (2014-2017). Interval censoring survival methods were used to estimate the age of initiation of (i) ever, (ii) past 30-day, and (iii) fairly regular cigarette use. Among never cigarette users when they first entered the adult study, interval censoring Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore differences in the estimated age of initiation of the three cigarette use outcomes by sex and by race/ethnicity, controlling for the effect of previous e-cigarette use and the total number of other tobacco products ever used (0-5 products) before cigarette initiation outcomes.Among the young adults who were never cigarette users at their first wave of adult participation, the highest increase in cigarette initiation occurred between 18 and 19 years old. By age 21, 10.6% (95% CI: 9.5-11.7) initiated ever cigarette use, 7.7% (95% CI: 6.1-8.1) initiated past 30-day of cigarette use, and 1.9% (95% CI: 1.4-2.5) initiated fairly regular cigarette use. After controlling for other tobacco products: (a) males were 83% more likely to initiate past 30-day cigarette use at earlier ages than females; (b) Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black young adults had increased risk to initiate past 30-day cigarette use at earlier ages than Non-Hispanic White young adults (62% and 34%, respectively).The substantial amount of cigarette initiation among young adults reinforces the need for prevention strategies among this population. Although, interventions are needed for all young adult populations, strategies should target 18-21-year-olds, with potentially differential prevention targets by sex and by race/ethnicity."
https://openalex.org/W3157292348,"Animal welfare scientists have accumulated knowledge and developed interventions to improve livestock welfare, but these are poorly adopted in commercial practice. Animal welfare interventions are rarely tested for economic viability and this limits their uptake. This study employs Stochastic Partial Budgeting (SPB) to determine the viability of animal welfare improvements. Aggression between pigs is used as an example because there is a large literature base from which to draw interventions, and the problem has persisted for decades without resolution. Costs and benefits of three interventions to control aggression (pre-weaning socialisation, synthetic maternal pheromones and large social groups) were estimated by reviewing the academic and industry literature and by conducting a survey of sixteen pig farmers. The net effects were compared to farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for interventions to reduce aggression as identified by recent research. Results are consistent with prior research which indicates that improving animal welfare generally comes at a cost to producers. Nevertheless, pre-weaning socialisation resulted in a neutral or positive net effect 38% of the time and should be central to campaigns promoting the control of aggression in the industry. Exposing pigs to synthetic maternal pheromones did not improve profitability but the net costs were small and within the realms of WTP for a sub-group of farmers with animal welfare goals. The net costs of converting existing buildings in order to house pigs in large social groups were beyond the realms of farmers' WTP. The approach adopted in this study, of combining SPB with WTP from the sector, should be extended to other animal welfare issues."
https://openalex.org/W3157333280,"We investigated the seasonal carbonate chemistry variability within a semi-enclosed tropical mangrove lagoon in southwestern Puerto Rico. Biweekly measurements of seawater temperature, salinity, total alkalinity (TA), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were conducted from 2014 to 2018. We describe the possible mechanisms driving the observed variability by correlating the DIC/TA ratio with pH and Ω arg , suggesting that the mean pH (7.87 ± 0.09) and aragonite saturation state (Ω arg , 2.96 ± 0.47) of the mangrove lagoon negatively affected calcification. The measured p CO 2 and DIC/TA ratios indicate that heterotrophic activity was the primary driver for persistent acidification, which reached its maximum expression during the wet season. We conclude that mangrove lagoons with limited seawater exchange and high carbon input will not mitigate ocean acidification."

Understanding host and disease phenotypes that may vary by region is important for optimizing curative treatments.We characterized clinical features and the serum proteome of phase 2 TB clinical trial participants undergoing treatment for smear positive, culture-confirmed TB, comparing host serum protein expression in clinical trial participants enrolled in African and Non-African regions. Serum samples were collected from 289 participants enrolled in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention TBTC Study 29 (NCT00694629) at time of enrollment and at the end of the intensive phase (after 40 doses of TB treatment).After a peptide level proteome analysis utilizing a unique liquid chromatography IM-MS platform (LC-IM-MS) and subsequent statistical analysis, a total of 183 core proteins demonstrated significant differences at both baseline and at week 8 timepoints between participants enrolled from African and non-African regions. The majority of the differentially expressed proteins were upregulated in participants from the African region, and included acute phase proteins, mediators of inflammation, as well as coagulation and complement pathways. Downregulated proteins in the African population were primarily linked to nutritional status and lipid metabolism pathways.We have identified differentially expressed nutrition and lipid pathway proteins by geographic region in TB patients undergoing treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, which appear to be associated with differential treatment responses. Future TB clinical trials should collect expanded measures of nutritional status and further evaluate the relationship between nutrition and microbiologic treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W3157489482,"In this study, dynamic compaction method was used to treat the gangue hill of the Xinglongzhuang coal mine in China, and the deep compaction of deep coal gangue was examined. The crushing characteristics and improving depth of coal gangue filling under different dynamic compaction conditions were determined. Dynamic compaction tests with different tamping energy were performed to improve the coal gangue filling. In addition, dynamic penetration tests and the foundation bearing capacity were conducted. The relationship between the tamping energy and improvement was investigated, and the optimum tamping energy, number of tamping blows, improving depth, and other dynamic compaction parameters and filling bearing characteristics were obtained. The field test results show that with increasing number of tamping blows, compaction induced deformation gradually decreased and begins to stabilize, while the optimum number of tamping blows increases with increasing ramming energy. The optimum number of tamping blows is in the range 9–11, and the effective coal gangue improving depth is in the range 6–8m, when the tamping energy is greater than 3000 kN.m. The gradation improved, and the weight percentage of the particles smaller than 4.75 mm was larger than 50%, resulting in better physical and mechanical behavior of the coal gangue filling. The coal gangue filling bearing capacity and anti-deformation ability increase with increasing tamping energy. The coal gangue filling bearing capacity reached at least 350 kPa after being improved by dynamic compaction with a tamping energy greater than 3000kN.m."
https://openalex.org/W3158282426,"Animal cells from the Vero lineage and MRC5 human cells were checked for their capacity to catalyse the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The Vero cells needed 72 hours’ incubation to induce ORR catalysis. The cyclic voltammetry curves were clearly modified by the presence of the cells with a shift of ORR of 50 mV towards positive potentials and the appearance of a limiting current (59 μA.cm -2 ). The MRC5 cells induced considerable ORR catalysis after only 4 h of incubation with a potential shift of 110 mV but with large experimental deviation. A longer incubation time, of 24 h, made the results more reproducible with a potential shift of 90 mV. The presence of carbon nanotubes on the electrode surface or pre-treatment with foetal bovine serum or poly-D-lysine did not change the results. These data are the first demonstrations of the capability of animal and human cells to catalyse electrochemical ORR. The discussion of the possible mechanisms suggests that these pioneering observations could pave the way for electrochemical biosensors able to characterize the protective system of cells against oxidative stress and its sensitivity to external agents."
https://openalex.org/W3157536599,"Bats use echolocation through flexible active sensing via ultrasounds to identify environments suitable for their habitat and foraging. Mimicking the sensing strategies of bats for echolocation, this study examined how humans acquire new acoustic-sensing abilities, and proposes effective strategies for humans. A target geometry identification experiment—involving 15 sighted people without experience of echolocation—was conducted using two targets with different geometries, based on a new sensing system. Broadband frequency-modulated pulses with short inter-pulse intervals (16 ms) were used as a synthetic echolocation signal. Such pulses mimic buzz signals emitted by bats for echolocation prior to capturing their prey. The study participants emitted the signal from a loudspeaker by tapping on Android devices. Because the signal included high-frequency signals up to 41 kHz, the emitted signal and echoes from a stationary or rotating target were recorded using a 1/7-scaled miniature dummy head. Binaural sounds, whose pitch was down-converted, were presented through headphones. This way, time-varying echo information was made available as an acoustic cue for target geometry identification under a rotating condition, as opposed to a stationary one. In both trials, with (i.e., training trials) and without (i.e., test trials) answer feedback immediately after the participants answered, the participants identified the geometries under the rotating condition. Majority of the participants reported using time-varying patterns in terms of echo intensity, timbre, and/or pitch under the rotating condition. The results suggest that using time-varying patterns in echo intensity, timbre, and/or pitch enables humans to identify target geometries. However, performance significantly differed by condition (i.e., stationary vs. rotating) only in the test trials. This difference suggests that time-varying echo information is effective for identifying target geometry through human echolocation especially when echolocators are unable to obtain answer feedback during sensing."

Named after their conspicuous and protective lorica, the phylum was first described from Roscoff (France) in 1983 and, hitherto, it contains only 40 species. Based on data collected from Roscoff during the past four decades, we here describe two new species of Nanaloricus , namely Nanaloricus valdemari sp. nov. and Nanaloricus mathildeae sp. nov., as well as a new genus and species, Scutiloricus hugoi gen. et sp. nov. Adults of N . valdemari sp. nov. are distinguished by a pair of unique cuticular ridges, here referred to as longitudinal stripes, spanning laterally along the anterior two thirds of the dorsal lorical plate. N . mathildeae sp. nov. is characterized by strong sexual dimorphism. Specifically, the branches composing the multiform male clavoscalids are much broader as compared to other Nanaloricus species. The two new Nanaloricus species are both characterized by unique sensory organs associated with the double trichoscalids. The size and exact position of these organs differ between the two species. Adults of Scutiloricus hugoi gen. et sp. nov. are characterized by, among other features, a square lorica composed of six cuticular plates with a total of 14 anterior spikes, of which 12 have transverse cuticular ridges and thus appear fenestrated; laterodorsal flosculi arranged linearly; a posterior lorical region characterized by an anal field with a small anal cone flanked by a pair of spurs. Notably, mature females are characterized by a pair of seminal receptacles, a character not previously reported in Loricifera. We discuss the new findings and compare N . valdemari sp. nov. and N . mathildeae sp.nov. with other species assigned to genus Nanaloricus . The distinguishing features of Scutiloricus hugoi gen. et sp. nov. are discussed from a comparative perspective with the other genera of family Nanaloricidae."

Soldiers can be found on the trails protecting foragers or guarding the different types of nest openings. The current study was performed to investigate the differential parasitism rates of Atta laevigata (Smith, 1858) worker castes by four species of phorids. Ants of all castes on trails and at nest entrances were collect from 18 mature colonies in the field. A total of 21,254 ants were collected from trails and 14,649 collected from the mounds of loose soil near nest openings. The captured workers were maintained under controlled laboratory conditions to evaluate the rate of parasitism. Of the ants collected from trails, 1,112 (5.23%) were found to have been parasitized, of which 1,102 were foragers and only 10 were soldiers. Of the ants collected from the soil mounds near the nest openings, only 27 (0.18%) were found to have been parasitized, of those 25 were excavators and 2 were soldiers. When evaluating parasitism of ants on the trails, 46.2% were attacked by Apocephalus attophilus Borgmeier, 1928, 22.6% by Myrmosicarius grandicornis Borgmeier, 1928, 16.6% by Eibesfeldtphora erthali (Brown, 2001) and 14.6% by Apocephalus vicosae Disney, 2000. Only two species of phorid, M. grandicornis and E. erthali, were observed parasitizing excavators, whilst only E. erthali parasitized soldiers. This is the first time that Atta spp. excavators and soldiers have been shown to be parasitized by phorids. The low rates of parasitism and specificity of certain phorid species for excavators and soldiers is discussed in relation to the behavioral interactions of hosts and their parasitoids, as well as the relationship between host and parasitoid size."
https://openalex.org/W3158191813,"Traditional studies of archaeological ceramics in Colombia have been largely based on visual and stylistic analyses. Here we introduce frameworks and concepts of reverse engineering as a complementary strategy to develop hypotheses about ceramic manufacture, as a first step to the address possible cross-craft relationships and broader sociocultural parameters affecting technical traditions. Our case study is focused on ceramic figurines recovered from two archaeological sites in southwest Colombia (Inguapí and La Cocotera), both dated to the period of greatest cultural and technological development of the Tumaco tradition (350 BC–AD 350). The results of the analyses including microscopy, XRF, SEM-EDS and XRD revealed two manufacturing pathways within the broader tradition, developed locally and adapted to the natural resources available to each site. These are shown through chemical and mineralogical differences in the raw materials, as well as differences in their preparation and shaping, molding, and modeling processes as observed at the microstructural level. Estimated firing temperatures are under 600°C for La Cocotera, and under 800°C for those of Inguapí, with an inhomogeneous, oxidizing atmosphere probably related to firing in a pit. The superficial characterization shows that all the figurines were painted, with those from Inguapí externally smoothed and polished, and those from La Cocotera covered with a slip. Notwithstanding differences between sites, the ceramic figurines illustrate a particular technical style that undoubtedly conveyed a shared ideological message of cultural affiliation. These results contribute in an innovative way to archaeological ceramic studies in Colombia from a different perspective that is complementary to the more common typological studies."
https://openalex.org/W3158318275,"Biofeedback constitutes a well-established, non-invasive method to voluntary interfere in emotional processing by means of cognitive strategies. However, treatment durations exhibit strong inter-individual variations and first successes can often be achieved only after a large number of sessions. Sham feedback constitutes a rather untapped approach by providing feedback that does not correspond to the participant's actual state. The current study aims to gain insights into mechanisms of sham feedback processing in order to support new techniques in biofeedback therapy. We carried out two experiments and applied different types of sham feedback on skin conductance responses and pupil size changes during affective processing. Results indicate that standardized but context-sensitive sham signals based on skin conductance responses exert a stronger influence on emotional regulation compared to individual sham feedback from ongoing pupil dynamics. Also, sham feedback should forego unnatural signal behavior to avoid irritation and skepticism among participants. Altogether, a reasonable combination of stimulus features and sham feedback characteristics enables to considerably reduce the actual bodily responsiveness already within a single session."
https://openalex.org/W3158997879,"The adult, mature central nervous system (CNS) has limited plasticity. Physical exercising can counteract this limitation by inducing plasticity and fostering processes such as learning, memory consolidation and formation. Little is known about the molecular factors that govern these mechanisms, and how they are connected with exercise. In this study, we used immunohistochemical and behavioral analyses to investigate how running wheel exercise affects expression of the neuronal plasticity-inhibiting protein Nogo-A in the rat cortex, and how it influences motor learning in vivo. Following one week of exercise, rats exhibited a decrease in Nogo-A levels, selectively in motor cortex layer 2/3, but not in layer 5. Nogo-A protein levels returned to baseline after two weeks of running wheel exercise. In a skilled motor task (forelimb-reaching), administration of Nogo-A function-blocking antibodies over the course of the first training week led to improved motor learning. By contrast, Nogo-A antibody application over two weeks of training resulted in impaired learning. Our findings imply a bimodal, time-dependent function of Nogo-A in exercise-induced neuronal plasticity: While an activity-induced suppression of the plasticity-inhibiting protein Nogo-A appears initially beneficial for enhanced motor learning, presumably by allowing greater plasticity in establishing novel synaptic connections, this process is not sustained throughout continued exercise. Instead, upregulation of Nogo-A over the course of the second week of running wheel exercise in rats implies that Nogo-A is required for consolidation of acquired motor skills during the delayed memory consolidation process, possibly by inhibiting ongoing neuronal morphological reorganization to stabilize established synaptic pathways. Our findings suggest that Nogo-A downregulation allows leaning to occur, i.e. opens a 'learning window', while its later upregulation stabilizes the learnt engrams. These findings underline the importance of appropriately timing of application of Nogo-A antibodies in future clinical trials that aim to foster memory performance while avoiding adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W3159048180,"Nations have been competing in sporting competitions for centuries. Therefore, explaining the success of different countries has a long history in sports science. At first, researchers tried to explain success patterns with the help of divergent geographical factors. Later, literature included other determinants on the macro-level which provide evidence that especially the GDP as a proxy for the prosperity of a country has a significant impact on success in sports. Within this broader field of research, also specialization patterns in sports developed into an important topic of research. In line with the literature on factors which lead to (national) success, so far, the discussion mostly concentrates on determinants on a macro-level. We identify the problem that different specialization patterns can be observed in countries that have similar factors on the macro-level, as well. There seems to be a research gap concerning the influencing factors on a meso-level. As a result, the aim of this paper is to show which determinants on the meso-level can affect sports specialization patterns. We provide a model based on the findings of lobbying theory that explains not only different specialization patterns between, e.g., Europe and Africa, but also different specialization patterns within a continent and dissimilar patterns of countries with a similar macro-level can be understood. Overall, our paper contributes to the discussion on specialization in elite sports from an economic perspective, so that future research can build on our work, in particular concerning empirical tests of our approach."
https://openalex.org/W3159831938,"Mature mRNA molecules are expected to be comprised of a 5'UTR, a 3'UTR and a coding region (CDS). Unexpectedly, however, there have been multiple recent reports of widespread differential expression of mRNA 3'UTRs and their cognate coding regions (CDS), reflecting the expression of isolated 3'UTRs (i3'UTRs); these i3'UTRs can be highly expressed, often in reciprocal patterns to their cognate CDS. As with other long non-coding (lncRNAs), isolated 3'UTRs are likely to play an important role in gene regulation, but little is known about the contexts in which they are deployed. To illuminate the functions of i3'UTRs, here we carry out in vitro, in vivo and in silico analyses of differential 3'UTR/CDS mRNA ratio usage across tissues, development and cell state changes both for a select list of developmentally important genes as well as by unbiased transcriptome-wide analyses. Across two developmental paradigms we find a distinct switch from high i3'UTR expression for stem cell related genes in proliferating cells to high CDS for these genes in newly differentiated cells. Unbiased transcriptome analysis across multiple gene sets shows that regardless of tissue, genes with high 3'UTR to CDS ratios belong predominantly to gene ontology categories related to cell-type specific functions. In contrast, the gene ontology categories of genes with low 3'UTR to CDS ratios are similar across tissues and relate to common cellular functions. We further show that, at least for some genes, traditional transcriptional start site genomic elements correspond to identified RNAseq 3'UTR peak regions, suggesting that some i3'UTRs may be generated by de novo transcription. Our results provide critical information from which detailed hypotheses for individual i3'UTRs can be tested, with a common theme that i3'UTRs appear poised to regulate cell-specific gene expression and state."
https://openalex.org/W3157426206,"A FLAG tag consisting of DYKDDDDK is an epitope tag that is frequently and widely used to detect recombinant proteins of interest. In this study, we performed a CRISPR-based genetic screening to identify factors involved in the detection of a FLAG-tagged misfolded model protein at the cell surface. In the screening, SLC35B2, which encodes 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate transporter 1, was identified as the candidate gene. The detection of FLAG-tagged misfolded proteins at the cell surface was significantly increased in SLC35B2-knockout cells. Furthermore, protein tyrosine sulfation mediated by tyrosyl-protein sulfotransferase 2 (TPST2) suppressed FLAG-tagged protein detection. Localization analysis of the FLAG-tagged misfolded proteins confirmed that defects in tyrosine sulfation are only responsible for enhancing anti-FLAG staining on the plasma membrane but not inducing the localization change of misfolded proteins on the plasma membrane. These results suggest that a FLAG tag on the misfolded protein would be sulfated, causing a reduced detection by the M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Attention should be required when quantifying the FLAG-tagged proteins in the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3159510546,"In order to access environmental conditions, the use of bioindicators that have a close relationship with environmental stressors is a largely common practice, but when evaluating environmental inferences, the individual dominant taxa need to be interpreted. Humid regions such as the marshlands are fragile ecosystems and sustain communities of microalgae, often used as bioindicators, of which diatoms are a good example. Although they provide an excellent response to chemical and physical changes in water, diatom studies in surface sediments in wetlands are scarce worldwide. To determine whether diatom species have the potential to provide unambiguous inferences in the influence of environmental factors, we have evaluated diatom abundance in surface sediment, from three Pantanal lakes, against a set of environmental gradients: pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, water temperature, index of trophic water status, total phosphorus and total nitrogen. The Ferradura lake presented an oligotrophic state and both Burro and Caracará lakes presented mesotrophic state. Diatoms were more abundant in the a mesotrophic conditions, but with higher species richness in the oligotrophic conditions. Depending on the N:P ratio, the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus can also play the role of pollutants and may have negative and unpredictable effects in the environment, such as biotic homogenization. Despite the spatial variation in species, there was a greater richness of Eunotia Ehrenberg species, with the highest relative density of Eunotia formica Ehrenberg and E. pantropica Glushchenko, Kulikovskiy & Kociolek, due to the environmental acidic conditions, a determining characteristic of this genus. It was also observed that a small increase in the level of phosphorus generated an increase in the abundance of Aulacoseira Thwaites with the highest relative density of A. pusilla (Meister) Tuji & Houki and A. veraluciae Tremarin, Torgan & T.Ludwig. However, A. italica dominated in the moderately acidic environment. The results can help with decisions in impacted areas to solve socioeconomic problems, environmental management and biodiversity."
