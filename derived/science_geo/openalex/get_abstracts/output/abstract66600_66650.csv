https://openalex.org/W1967409117,"WE have found substances in the culture filtrate of a fungus, strain 501–7w (genus and species unidentified), that stimulated the growth of cotyledons of Chinese cabbage seedlings (Brassica campestris L. subsp. Napus Hook.). The active components, which we call cotylenin A and B, have been isolated, and some of their physical properties determined."

https://openalex.org/W1971942119,"GLYCIDOL (2,3-epoxypropanol) phosphate inactivates and becomes covalently bound to triose phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1; TIM); the kinetics and stoichiometry of the reaction, and the structure of the reagent, indicate a specific reaction at the active centre of the enzyme1. The site that is labelled by this inhibitor, and by glycidol in the presence of inorganic phosphate, has now been identified, lodohydroxyacetone phosphate2 and bromohydroxyacetone phosphate3 are also specific inhibitors of TIM. The amino-acid sequence round the site in chicken muscle TIM labelled by the bromo compound has been established4; we were greatly helped by knowing the sequence of their peptide."

https://openalex.org/W2043128568,"THE complete cycle of development from egg to egg for a pelagic species of chaetognath has not been achieved previously1 in the laboratory. Dallot2 maintained Sagitta setosa and Murikami3,4 S. crassa long enough to observe cyclic reproductive changes. Murikami reared larvae for several days as I did5 with S. hispida. Otherwise, the life span of most chaetognaths brought into the laboratory has been measured in hours6. Extended studies of live chaetognaths would be useful because these are among the commonest marine macroplanktonic carnivores and, as such, must play a major part in the trophodynamics of the sea. They have also frequently been used as “indicator species” for water masses7."

https://openalex.org/W1981013834,"THE distribution of carbon monoxide in erythrocytes of persons exposed to high concentrations of gas for short periods was investigated using a modification of the staining technique described by Betke and Kleihauer1. The experiments consisted of examination of citrated human blood carboxylated with pure CO and then decarboxylated with oxygen, and capillary blood taken at intervals following inhalation of CO as the pure gas or from tobacco smoke."

https://openalex.org/W1980619804,"AFTER a radiation accident in July 1969 we had the opportunity of comparing radiation dose estimates made by biological and physical methods. The biological method involved counting chromosome aberrations in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes, and the physical method was based on a reconstruction of the accident. For the conditions of this accident a reasonable agreement was obtained between the two methods, which adds to the growing confidence in the use of chromosome aberration counting for dose assessment in radiation accidents."
