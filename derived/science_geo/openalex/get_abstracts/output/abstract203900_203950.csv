https://openalex.org/W2019356413,"Under severe conditions in the arctic the physical environment frequently overrides biological competition, allowing essentially random occurrence of plants without distinct associations and with the frequent coexistence of related species that have extremely similar requirements. Furthermore, a mixed population may be so advantageous in reducing disease incidence as to offset competition."

https://openalex.org/W1990229509,Differential visual sensitivity to vertical and horizontal linear polarization is shown in the light-induced eyestalk deviations of Ocypode quadrata. Responses with the e-vector vertical averaged about 6 degrees greater than those with e-vector horizontal. This difference approximates the relative eyestalk deviation induced by unpolarized light intensities having a ratio of 3:1

https://openalex.org/W2024180702,"A relatively high incidence of malarial infections has been noted in recent importations of rhesus monkeys from Pakistan. This finding, contraverting the widely held belief that rhesus monkeys are free of natively acquired malaria, is of substantial significance to those employing Pakistanian rhesus monkeys in their investigations."

https://openalex.org/W2113719034,"SUMMARY The suggestion that the fluorescence and toxicity of botulinum toxin were due to a common structure within the molecule has been found to be invalid. It was found possible to inactivate the toxin by treatment with urea and adsorption on a cel- lulose ion exchange resin without parallel reduction in fluores- cence. The role of native configuration in protein fluorescence has been discussed. Acknowledgments--The authors wish to extend their apprecia- tion to Dr. Gregorio Weber for his helpful discussion.

https://openalex.org/W2074853347,"Cortical, subcortical, and peripheral sensory nerve potentials were studied in cats to determine comparative thresholds of response. Stimuli capable of eliciting responses in peripheral nerve also invariably elicited responses from thalamus and cortex. Together with relevant data from human studies, the results indicate that stimuli subthreshold for perception do not affect the nervous system. They also have implications for studies of ""subliminal"" perception."
https://openalex.org/W2068952407,"ENDOCRINE organs are able to maintain high concentration gradients between their secretory cells and the extracellular fluid. The mechanisms for maintaining this gradient are not clear, although restraining the hormones within a semipermeable membranous structure could sub-serve this function. Herlant1 and Brown and Hess2 have shown that many hormones of the anterior pituitary are stored in a particulate form. In addition, the work of Hillarp et al. 3 and Blaschko and Welch4 indicates that adrenaline and noradrenaline are stored in granules within the adrenomedullary cells."

The pattern can be eliminated by breathing 9 percent O(2) or 10 percent CO(2). However, the pattern frequently persists during breathing of high oxygen."
