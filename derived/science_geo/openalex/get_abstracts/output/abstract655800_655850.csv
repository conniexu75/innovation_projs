https://openalex.org/W3037945517,"The causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, highlighting an urgent need to develop antiviral therapies. Here we present a quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells, revealing dramatic rewiring of phosphorylation on host and viral proteins. SARS-CoV-2 infection promoted casein kinase II (CK2) and p38 MAPK activation, production of diverse cytokines, and shutdown of mitotic kinases, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Infection also stimulated a marked induction of CK2-containing filopodial protrusions possessing budding viral particles. Eighty-seven drugs and compounds were identified by mapping global phosphorylation profiles to dysregulated kinases and pathways. We found pharmacologic inhibition of the p38, CK2, CDK, AXL, and PIKFYVE kinases to possess antiviral efficacy, representing potential COVID-19 therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3036607916,"Neutralizing antibody responses to coronaviruses mainly target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the trimeric spike. Here, we characterized polyclonal immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) and Fabs from COVID-19 convalescent individuals for recognition of coronavirus spikes. Plasma IgGs differed in their focus on RBD epitopes, recognition of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, and contributions of avidity to increased binding/neutralization of IgGs over Fabs. Using electron microscopy, we examined specificities of polyclonal plasma Fabs, revealing recognition of both S1A and RBD epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike. Moreover, a 3.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a neutralizing monoclonal Fab-spike complex revealed an epitope that blocks ACE2 receptor binding. Modeling based on these structures suggested different potentials for inter-spike crosslinking by IgGs on viruses, and characterized IgGs would not be affected by identified SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations. Overall, our studies structurally define a recurrent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody class derived from VH3-53/VH3-66 and similarity to a SARS-CoV VH3-30 antibody, providing criteria for evaluating vaccine-elicited antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3037923073,"Vaccines are urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 and previously emerging MERS/SARS caused by coronavirus (CoV) infections. The CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is an attractive vaccine target but is undermined by limited immunogenicity. We describe a dimeric form of MERS-CoV RBD that overcomes this limitation. The RBD-dimer significantly increased neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers compared to conventional monomeric form and protected mice against MERS-CoV infection. Crystal structure showed RBD-dimer fully exposed dual receptor-binding motifs, the major target for NAbs. Structure-guided design further yielded a stable version of RBD-dimer as a tandem repeat single-chain (RBD-sc-dimer) which retained the vaccine potency. We generalized this strategy to design vaccines against COVID-19 and SARS, achieving 10- to 100-fold enhancement of NAb titers. RBD-sc-dimers in pilot scale production yielded high yields, supporting their scalability for further clinical development. The framework of immunogen design can be universally applied to other beta-CoV vaccines to counter emerging threats."

The presumptive causes of this increase were expanding open water area and a longer growing season—at least until now. Lewis et al. show that although these factors may have driven the productivity trends before, over the past decade, phytoplankton primary production rose by more than half because of increased phytoplankton concentrations (see the Perspective by Babin). This finding means that there has been an influx of new nutrients into the region, suggesting that the Arctic Ocean could become more productive and export additional carbon in the future.

Horowitz et al. tested whether the beneficial effects of exercise on neurogenesis in the brain and improved cognition in aged mice could be transferred in plasma (blood without its cellular components) from one mouse to another (see the Perspective by Ansere and Freeman). Indeed, aged mice that received plasma from young or old mice that had exercised showed beneficial effects in their brains without hitting the treadmill. The authors identified glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1 as a factor in plasma that might, in part, mediate this favorable effect. Science , this issue p. 167 ; see also p. 144"

Cellulose fibers are formed from close-packed single chains of cellulose that have been proposed to be formed by multimeric complexes (18 or more subunits) of the enzyme cellulose synthase, which exists in several isoforms. Purushotham et al. determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of a trimer of a single isoform of cellulose synthase. A large channel forms a path for cellulose chains through the membrane-embedded complex. The structure also reveals oligomeric interfaces and provides a framework for modeling the larger complexes seen in plant membranes. The close arrangement of exit sites for nascent glycan chains is consistent with the enzyme complex playing a role in directing cellulose microfibril formation. Science , this issue p. 1089"

https://openalex.org/W3040925369,"Cell-cell contacts specify cell fate Ascidians, or sea squirts, are marine invertebrate filter feeders with highly reproducible cellular events and invariant embryonic cell lineages. Guignard et al. studied the ascidian embryo to address the determinants of this cellular reproducibility. They introduce computational methods for the robust and automated segmentation, tracking, and analysis of whole-cell behaviors in high-throughput light-sheet microscopy datasets. This work shows that cell induction can be controlled by the contact area among cells. The range of cell signaling is proposed to set the scale at which animal embryonic reproducibility is observed. A high level of reproducibility of embryonic geometries may also counter-intuitively lift constraints on genome evolution, thereby contributing to the rapid molecular evolution observed in ascidians.

Although other actin-regulatory proteins modulate human immune responses, the precise role for the WRC has not yet been established. Cook et al. studied five patients from four unrelated families who harbor missense variants of the gene encoding the WRC component HEM1. These patients presented with recurrent infections and poor antibody responses, along with enhanced allergic and autoimmune disorders. HEM1 was found to be required for the regulation of cortical actin and granule release in T cells and also interacted with a key metabolic signaling complex contributing to the disease phenotype. By linking these interactions to immune function, this work suggests potential targets for future immunotherapies. Science , this issue p. 202"

https://openalex.org/W3042148774,"The relationship of gut microbiota and calcium oxalate stone has been limited investigated, especially with no study of gut microbiota and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in nephrolithiasis. We provided Sprague Dawley rats of renal calcium oxalate stones with antibiotics and examined the renal crystals deposition. We also performed a case-control study by analyzing 16S rRNA microbial profiling, shotgun metagenomics and SCFAs in 153 fecal samples from non-kidney stone (NS) controls, patients with occasional renal calcium oxalate stones (OS) and patients with recurrent stones (RS). Antibiotics reduced bacterial load in feces and could promote the formation of renal calcium crystals in model rats. In addition, both OS and RS patients exhibited higher fecal microbial diversity than NS controls. Several SCFAs-producing gut bacteria, as well as metabolic pathways associated with SCFAs production, were considerably lower in the gut microbiota among the kidney stone patients compared with the NS controls. Representation of genes involved in oxalate degradation showed no significance difference among groups. However, fecal acetic acid concentration was the highest in RS patients with high level of urinary oxalate, which was positively correlated with genes involvement in oxalate synthesis. Administration of SCFAs reduced renal crystals. These results shed new light on bacteria and SCFAs, which may promote the development of treatment strategy in nephrolithiasis."

Maeda et al. examined the basis of specificity of a snake venom toxin binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MAChRs), which mediate many functions of the central and parasympathetic nervous systems. They determined a structure that shows why the mamba venom toxin MT7 is specific for one receptor, M 1 AChR, and also explains how it inhibits downstream signaling. Based on this structure, they engineered MT7 to be selective for another receptor, M 2 AChR, instead of M 1 ChR. The toxin may present a promising scaffold for developing specific GPCR modulators.

https://openalex.org/W3041372959,"In this research, we have investigated doubly singular ordinary differential equations and a real application problem of studying the temperature profile in a porous fin model. We have suggested a novel soft computing strategy for the training of unknown weights involved in the feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs). Our neuroevolutionary approach is used to suggest approximate solutions to a highly nonlinear doubly singular type of differential equations. We have considered a real application from thermodynamics, which analyses the temperature profile in porous fins. For this purpose, we have used the optimizer, namely, the fractional-order particle swarm optimization technique (FO-DPSO), to minimize errors in solutions through fitness functions. ANNs are used to design the approximate series of solutions to problems considered in this paper. We find the values of unknown weights such that the approximate solutions to these problems have a minimum residual error. For global search in the domain, we have initialized FO-DPSO with random solutions, and it collects best so far solutions in each generation/ iteration. In the second phase, we have fine-tuned our algorithm by initializing FO-DPSO with the collection of best so far solutions. It is graphically illustrated that this strategy is very efficient in terms of convergence and minimum mean squared error in its best solutions. We can use this strategy for the higher-order system of differential equations modeling different important real applications."
https://openalex.org/W3041144301,"Introduction Static stretching (SS) program are widely used in clinical and athletic settings. Many previous studies investigate the effect of SS program on muscle strength and muscle architecture (muscle thickness, and pennation angleh). However, no consensus has been reached about the effect of SS programs on muscle strength and muscle architecture. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 6-week SS programs performed at different weekly frequencies on muscle strength, muscle thickness and pennation angle at different ankle joint positions. Methods A total of 24 healthy male volunteers were performed 6-week SS programs (2,160 s of SS: 360 s/week*6 weeks) and were randomized to a group that performed SS once a week, or a group that performed SS three times per week. Total time under stretching was equated between groups. The muscle strength (maximum voluntary isometric contraction) at three different ankle joints were assessed before and after the 6-week SS program. In addition, muscle thickness and pennation angle were assessed by ultrasonography before and after 6-week SS program. Results There were no significant changes in all variables before and after the 6-week SS program, regardless of weekly frequency (p > 0.05). Conclusions Our results suggest that 6-week SS programs do not increase muscle strength or muscle architecture at different ankle joint positions, regardless of stretching frequency; however, no negative effect on these outcomes was observed, contrary to evidence on the immediate, detrimental effects of SS."
https://openalex.org/W3041991260,"To investigate the growth, physiological changes and mechanism of drought resistance of Camellia oleifera GWu-2 under drought stress conditions, changes in the main growth and physiological indices of GWu-2 under different water gradients were studied. Factor analysis was used to study the differences between indicators under different water gradients, and correlation analysis was implemented to analyze the relationship between different factors. We observed that the growth state, enzyme secretion, stomatal morphology and leaf osmotic adjustment substances were significantly affected by drought stress. In particular, increases in leaf abscisic acid (ABA), indole acetic acid (IAA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) contents under drought stress were negatively correlated with the stomatal opening degree, and the ratio of ZR/GA3 was significantly correlated with the growth and physiological indicators of GWu-2, indicating that different hormones respond differently to drought stress and have different functions in the growth regulation and drought resistance of GWu-2. We concluded that the drought resistance mechanism of GWu-2 was controlled by maintaining root growth to obtain the necessary water, increasing the contents of osmotic substances of leaves to maintain water holding capacity, reducing the transpiration of water by increasing leaf ABA, IAA and MeJA content to close stomata and reducing the damage caused by drought by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD)."
https://openalex.org/W3041800572,"Purpose To evaluate the changes in the retinochoroidal vasculature in patients with exogenous obesity using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA). Methods In this prospective study, 60 patients diagnosed with obesity (47 males) (mean age: 46.47±10.9 years) were included, of which 30 patients underwent bariatric surgery (Group A), and 30 patients underwent conservative management (exercise/diet) (Group B). Parameters including choroidal thickness (CT), choroidal vascularity index (CVI) and retinal capillary density index (CDI) and arteriovenous ratio (AVR) were measured at the baseline and three months follow up. 30 eyes (30 age and gender-matched) of normal participants were included for comparison. Results Baseline CT was lower in 60 participants with obesity compared to controls. Compared with normal subjects, subjects with obesity had higher mean CVI (0.66±0.02 versus 0.63±0.04; p<0.01), smaller FAZ area (0.26±0.07 versus 0.45±0.32; p<0.01), higher CDI (superficial plexus: 0.7±0.04 versus 0.68±0.06; p = 0.04, deep plexus: 0.38±0.02 versus 0.35±0.06; p = 0.01), and lower AVR (0.68±0.05 versus 0.70±0.03 versus; p<0.01). At 3-month after intervention, CT showed a significant increase in participants from Group A (329.27±79μm; p<0.01) but not in Group B from baseline. No significant change was noted in CVI or CDI at 3-month in either group compared to baseline. AVR significantly increased in Group B (p = 0.03). Conclusion Subclinical changes in retinochoroidal vasculature occurs in participants with exogenous obesity compared to healthy subjects. Surgical intervention (bariatric surgery) may have a favorable outcome on the choroidal thickness in these patients."

Zinc being a micronutrient enhanced the callogenesis and regeneration efficiency of Panicum virgatum at different concentrations. Here, we synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles through Cymbopogon citratus leaves extract to evaluate the effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles on plant regeneration ability in switchgrass. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) validate phase purity of green synthesize Zinc oxide nanoparticles whereas, electron microscopy (SEM) has illustrated the average size of particle 50±4 nm with hexagonal rod like shape. Energy dispersive spectroscopy X-ray (EDS) depicted major peaks of Zn (92.68%) while minor peaks refer to Oxygen (7.32%). ZnO-NPs demonstrated the incredibly promising results against callogenesis. Biosynthesized ZnO-NPs at optimum concentration showed very promising effect on plant regeneration ability. Both the explants, seeds and nodes showed dose dependent response and upon high doses exceeding 40 mg/L the results were recorded negative, whereas at 30 mg/L both explants demonstrated 70% and 76% regeneration frequency. The results conclude that ZnO-NPs enhance the plant growth and development and tailored the nutritive properties at nano-scale. Furthermore, eco-friendly approach of ZnO-NPs synthesis is strongly believed to improve in vitro regeneration frequencies in several other monocot plants."
https://openalex.org/W3041298968,"Neural decoding and neuromodulation technologies hold great promise for treating mood and other brain disorders in next-generation therapies that manipulate functional brain networks. Here we perform a novel causal network analysis to decode multiregional communication in the primate mood processing network and determine how neuromodulation, short-burst tetanic microstimulation (sbTetMS), alters multiregional network communication. The causal network analysis revealed a mechanism of network excitability that regulates when a sender stimulation site communicates with receiver sites. Decoding network excitability from neural activity at modulator sites predicted sender-receiver communication, whereas sbTetMS neuromodulation temporarily disrupted sender-receiver communication. These results reveal specific network mechanisms of multiregional communication and suggest a new generation of brain therapies that combine neural decoding to predict multiregional communication with neuromodulation to disrupt multiregional communication."
https://openalex.org/W3041422815,"Aims Although patients supported with a Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device (CF-LVAD) are hemodynamically stable, their exercise capacity is limited. Hence, the aim of this work was to investigate the underlying factors that lead to peak and submaximal exercise intolerance of CF-LVAD supported patients. Methods Seven months after CF-LVAD implantation, eighty three patients performed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test and a six minute walk test. Peak oxygen uptake and the distance walked were measured and expressed as a percentage of the predicted value (%VO2p and %6MWD, respectively). Preoperative conditions, echocardiography, laboratory results and pharmacological therapy data were collected and a correlation analysis against %VO2p and %6MWD was performed. Results CF-LVAD patients showed a relatively higher submaximal exercise capacity (%6MWD = 64±16%) compared to their peak exertion (%VO2p = 51±14%). The variables that correlated with %VO2p were CF-LVAD parameters, chronotropic response, opening of the aortic valve at rest, tricuspid insufficiency, NT-proBNP and the presence of a cardiac implantable electronic device. On the other hand, the variables that correlated with %6MWD were diabetes, creatinine, urea, ventilation efficiency and CF-LVAD pulsatility index. Additionally, both %6MWD and %VO2p were influenced by the CF-LVAD implantation timing, calculated from the occurrence of the cardiac disease. Conclusion Overall, both %6MWD and %VO2p depend on the duration of heart failure prior to CF-LVAD implantation. %6MWD is primarily determined by parameters underlying the patient’s general condition, while %VO2p mostly relies on the residual function and chronotropic response of the heart. Moreover, since %VO2p was relatively lower compared to %6MWD, we might infer that CF-LVAD can support submaximal exercise but is not sufficient during peak exertion. Hence concluding that the contribution of the ventricle is crucial in sustaining hemodynamics at peak exercise."

However, since exposures to radio frequency radiations (RFR) >2.4 GHz are still uncommon, concerns about their potential health impacts are ongoing. In this study, we used the embryonic zebrafish model to assess the impacts of a 3.5 GHz RFR on biology- a frequency typically used by 5G-enabled cell phones and lies within the 4G and 5G bandwidth. We established a plate-based exposure setup for RFRs, exposed developing zebrafish to 3.5 GHz RFR, specific absorption rate (SAR) ≈ 8.27 W/Kg from 6 h post fertilization (hpf) to 48 hpf, and measured a battery of morphological and behavioral endpoints at 120 hpf. Our results revealed no significant impacts on mortality, morphology or photomotor response and a modest inhibition of startle response suggesting some levels of sensorimotor disruptions. This suggests that the cell phone radiations at low GHz-level frequencies are likely benign, with subtle sensorimotor effects. Through this assessment, we have established a robust setup for zebrafish RFR exposures readily amenable to testing various powers and frequencies. Future developmental exposure studies in zebrafish will evaluate a wider portion of the radio frequency spectrum to discover the bioactive regions, the potential molecular targets of RFR and the potential long-term effects on adult behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3040909400,"Objective Predictive models for preterm infant mortality have been developed internationally, albeit not valid for all populations. This study aimed to develop and validate different mortality predictive models, using Spanish data, to be applicable to centers with similar morbidity and mortality. Methods Infants born alive, admitted to NICU (BW<1500 g or GA<30 w), and registered in the SEN1500 database, were included. There were two time periods; development of the predictive models (2009–2012) and validation (2013–2015). Three models were produced; prenatal (1), first 24 hours of life (2), and whilst admitted (3). For the statistical analysis, hospital mortality was the dependent variable. Significant variables were used in multivariable regression models. Specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC), for all models, were calculated. Results Out of 14953 included newborns, 2015 died; 373 (18.5%) in their first 24 hours, 1315 (65.3%) during the first month, and 327 (16.2%) thereafter, before discharge. In the development stage, mortality prediction AUC was 0.834 (95% CI: 0.822–0.846) (p<0.001) in model 1 and 0.872 (95% CI: 0.860–0.884) (p<0.001) in model 2. Model 3’s AUC was 0.989 (95% CI: 0.983–0.996) (p<0.001) and 0.942 (95% CI: 0.929–0.956) (p<0.001) during the 0–30 and >30 days of life, respectively. During validation, models 1 and 2 showed moderate concordance, whilst that of model 3 was good. Conclusion Using dynamic models to predict individual mortality can improve outcome estimations. Development of models in the prenatal period, first 24 hours, and during hospital admission, cover key stages of mortality prediction in preterm infants."
https://openalex.org/W3041526784,"In the heart, the serine carboxypeptidase cathepsin A (CatA) is distributed between lysosomes and the extracellular matrix (ECM). CatA-mediated degradation of extracellular peptides may contribute to ECM remodeling and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of CatA overexpression on LV remodeling. A proteomic analysis of the secretome of adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts upon digestion by CatA identified the extracellular antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) as a novel substrate of CatA, which decreased EC-SOD abundance 5-fold. In vitro, both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts expressed and secreted CatA protein, and only cardiac fibroblasts expressed and secreted EC-SOD protein. Cardiomyocyte-specific CatA overexpression and increased CatA activity in the LV of transgenic mice (CatA-TG) reduced EC-SOD protein levels by 43%. Loss of EC-SOD-mediated antioxidative activity resulted in significant accumulation of superoxide radicals (WT, 4.54 μmol/mg tissue/min; CatA-TG, 8.62 μmol/mg tissue/min), increased inflammation, myocyte hypertrophy (WT, 19.8 μm; CatA-TG, 21.9 μm), cellular apoptosis, and elevated mRNA expression of hypertrophy-related and profibrotic marker genes, without affecting intracellular detoxifying proteins. In CatA-TG mice, LV interstitial fibrosis formation was enhanced by 19%, and the type I/type III collagen ratio was shifted toward higher abundance of collagen I fibers. Cardiac remodeling in CatA-TG was accompanied by an increased LV weight/body weight ratio and LV end diastolic volume (WT, 50.8 μl; CatA-TG, 61.9 μl). In conclusion, CatA-mediated EC-SOD reduction in the heart contributes to increased oxidative stress, myocyte hypertrophy, ECM remodeling, and inflammation, implicating CatA as a potential therapeutic target to prevent ventricular remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W3041805673,"The aim of the study is to compare the spatial working memory and visual perception between children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing control (TDC). Furthermore, this study validated whether this impairment was a feature of autism in general population with different autism-like traits (ALTs). This study contains two parts: case-control study and community population study. The ASD group and the control group were enlisted voluntarily (ASD group, n = 52; control group, n = 32). In the population study, we recruited 2994 children. Based on the scores of Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), children were divided into two groups (higher ALTs n = 122, lower ALTs n = 122). The participants completed the cognition tasks focusing on spatial working memory, visual-motor integration, and Intelligence. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted, with potential confounders IQ, age, and gender were controlled. Pearson correlations were computed by controlling the IQ and age as covariate to better understand the relations between visual perception, spatial working memory, and autism-like traits. In the case-control study, the results of cognition tasks focusing on the spatial working memory and visual perception indicated underperformance in children with ASD. In the community population study, we found that individuals with higher ALTs performed worse than children with lower ALTs in spatial working memory. Pearson correlation analysis suggested that a correlation between SWM total errors and visual perception was identified both in the children with ASD and in community population (ASD group, r = -0.592, p<0.001; general population, r = -0.201, p = 0.003). It suggested that spatial working memory deficit was a characteristic of autism, and may be distributed across the general population. Furthermore, we speculated a correlation between spatial working memory and visual perception in children with ASD and in general population."
https://openalex.org/W3094830022,"The efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy in solid tumors is far from satisfactory. In this study, we investigated the influence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) on the antitumor effect of CAR-T cells and explored the potential efficacy of combining CAR-T cells with inhibitors targeting EMT. We successfully induced EMT in tumor cells with TGF-β1, and the antitumor effect of HER2-directed CAR-T cells was significantly suppressed by EMT. Upregulation of PD-L1 was observed in tumor cells undergoing EMT, and change in PD-L1 expression during the EMT process was dependent on the MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Inhibition of the TGF-β1 pathway could block the EMT process in tumor cells and restore their susceptibility to HER2-directed CAR-T cells in vitro. In addition, targeting the TGF-β1 pathway significantly enhanced the antitumor effect of HER2-directed CAR-T cells in vivo. Our findings suggest that blocking EMT could potently enhance the antitumor effect of CAR-T cells, which provides a promising approach to improving the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2998866272,"In eukaryotic cells, KDEL receptors (KDELRs) facilitate the retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal proteins from the Golgi compartment back to the ER. Apart from the well-documented retention function, recent findings reveal that the cellular KDELRs have more complex roles, e.g. in cell signalling, protein secretion, cell adhesion and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, several studies suggest that a sub-population of KDELRs is located at the cell surface, where they could form and internalize KDELR/cargo clusters after K/HDEL-ligand binding. However, so far it has been unclear whether there are cell-type- or species-specific differences in KDELR clustering. By comparing ligand-induced KDELR clustering in different mouse and human cell lines via live cell imaging, we show that macrophage cell lines from both species do not develop any clusters. Using RT-qPCR experiments and numerical analysis, we address the role of KDELR expression as well as endocytosis and exocytosis rates on the receptor clustering at the plasma membrane and discuss how the efficiency of directed transport to preferred docking sites on the membrane influences the exponent of the power-law distribution of the cluster size."
https://openalex.org/W3041469082,"Combinations of three or more drugs are routinely used in various medical fields such as clinical oncology and infectious diseases to prevent resistance or to achieve synergistic therapeutic benefits. The very large number of possible high-order drug combinations presents a formidable challenge for discovering synergistic drug combinations. Here, we establish a guided screen to discover synergistic three-drug combinations. Using traditional checkerboard and recently developed diagonal methods, we experimentally measured all pairwise interactions among eight compounds in Erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight. Showing that synergy measurements of these two methods agree, we predicted synergy/antagonism scores for all possible three-drug combinations by averaging the synergy scores of pairwise interactions. We validated these predictions by experimentally measuring 35 three-drug interactions. Therefore, our guided screen for discovering three-drug synergies is (i) experimental screen of all pairwise interactions using diagonal method, (ii) averaging pairwise scores among components to predict three-drug interaction scores, (iii) experimental testing of top predictions. In our study, this strategy resulted in a five-fold reduction in screen size to find the most synergistic three-drug combinations."

All 173 patients referred between June 2016 and August 2018 were selected. Case records were analyzed for patient characteristics, referring doctor, chief complaint, performed investigations, follow-up time and, established diagnosis, additional diagnoses, initiated treatment and reported benefit. Results A new diagnosis was established in 13% of all patients. A new treatment was initiated in 56% of all patients: 91% and 51% of patients with and without a new diagnosis respectively (p < 0.001). Of all patients, 19% received an effective treatment (52% vs 14% of patients with vs without a new diagnosis, p < 0.001). Regardless of treatment, resolution or improvement of the chief complaint was achieved in 28% of all patients (52% vs 25% of patients with vs without a new diagnosis, p = 0.006). Regarding diagnostics, 23-33% of radiology, endoscopy and pathology tests performed during second opinion were a repetition of previously conducted investigations. Conventional blood tests were a repetition in 89% of cases. Median time to diagnosis was 64 days (IQR: 25–128 days) and median time to discharge was 75 days (IQR: 31–144 days). Conclusion Second opinions in general internal medicine lead to the establishment of a new diagnosis in a small proportion of patients. However, the value of second opinions may not be limited to the establishment of diagnoses, as new treatments are often initiated and overall patients report improved symptomatology in 28% of cases."
https://openalex.org/W3040707662,"Eisenia andrei (Ea) and E. fetida (Ef) lumbricid earthworms are simultaneous hermaphrodites potentially capable of self-fertilization and hybridization. We have shown previously that reproductive isolation in these species is incomplete in Ea and Ef earthworms of French provenance, as viable offspring appeared in inter-specific pairs. Fertile asymmetric hybrids developed from Ea-derived ova fertilized by Ef-derived spermatozoa, as well as Ea or Ef specimens derived after self-fertilization (resulting from admixture of endogenously produced spermatozoa with sperm from a partner), but never Ef-hybrids from Ef-ova fertilized by Ea-spermatozoa. The latter appeared only in backcrosses of Ea-hybrids with the Ef. Here we show that these phenomena are not unique for French Ea/Ef earthworms, but are shared by earthworms from French, Hungarian, and Polish laboratory cultures. Semi-quantitative studies on fertility of Ea-derived hybrids revealed gradually decreasing numbers of offspring in three successive generations, more rapid in backcrosses with Ef than with Ea, and the absence of progeny in pairs of hybrids, despite the presence of cocoons in almost all pairs. Based on species specific mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, we provide the first examples of two unique sterile hybrids with mitonuclear mismatch and potential mitonuclear incompatibility among offspring of one of the hybrid+Ef pairs. Earthworms from the investigated populations did not reproduce when kept from hatching in isolation or with representatives of Dendrobaena veneta but started reproducing upon recognition of a related partner, such as Ea, Ef or their hybrids. The existence of Ea or Ef specimens among offspring of hybrid+Ea/Ef pairs might be explained either by partner-induced self-fertilization of Ea/Ef or hybrid-derived ova, or by cross-fertilization of Ea/Ef /hybrid ova by partner-derived spermatozoa; the latter might contribute to interspecific gene introgression."
https://openalex.org/W3040899082,"Objective To use hospital-level data from the US to determine whether private patient rooms (PPRs) are associated with fewer in hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) infections. Methods We retrospectively analyzed Texas Inpatient Public Use Data with discharges between September 2015 and August 2016 merged with American Hospital Association annual survey data. We used negative binomial regression to estimate the association between the proportion of PPRs within a hospital and the count of discharges with HA-MRSA infections, adjusting for potentially confounding variables. Results We analyzed data for 340 hospitals and 2,670,855 discharges. HA-MRSA incidence within these hospitals was 386 per 100,000 discharges (95% CI: 379, 393) and, on average, 62.73% (95% CI: 58.99, 66.46) of rooms in these hospitals were PPRs. PPRs were significantly associated with fewer HA-MRSA infections (unadjusted IRR = 0.973, 95% CI: 0.968, 0.979; adjusted IRR = 0.992, 95% CI: 0.991, 0.994; p<0.001 for both); at the hospital level, as the percentage of PPRs increased, HA-MRSA infection rates decreased. This association was non-linear; in hospitals with few PPRs there was a stronger association between PPRs and HA-MRSA infection rate relative to hospitals with many PPRs. Conclusion We identified 0.8% fewer HA-MRSA infections for each 1% increase in PPRs as a proportion of all rooms, suggesting that private rooms provide substantial protection from HA-MRSA. Small changes may not induce significant improvements in HA-MRSA incidence, and hospitals seeking tangible benefits in HAI reduction likely need to markedly increase the proportion of PPRs through large-scale renovations. The effect of private rooms is disproportionate across hospitals. Hospitals with proportionately fewer PPRs stand to gain the most from adding additional PPRs, while those with an already high proportion of PPRs are unlikely to see large benefits. Our findings enable hospital administrators to consider potential patient safety benefits as they make decisions about facility design and renovation."
https://openalex.org/W3041345294,"Although combination therapy using clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol is recommended for patients with pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, some patients do not tolerate it because of adverse effects or underlying diseases. The efficacy and safety of fluoroquinolone-containing combination regimens as an alternative remain uncertain. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of fluoroquinolone-containing regimens with those of the standard regimens for treating pulmonary MAC disease.We retrospectively included consecutive MAC patients who were treated in our hospital between January 2011 and May 2019. Patients treated with fluoroquinolone-containing regimens who had relapsed after treatment with standard regimens were excluded. A propensity score analysis was conducted to reduce selection bias, and the proportions of clinical improvement, defined by chest imaging findings and sputum conversion, were compared between the fluoroquinolone-containing regimen and standard regimen groups.We analyzed 28 patients who received fluoroquinolone-containing regimens and 46 who received the standard regimen. Fluoroquinolone-containing regimens were more likely selected for patients with cavitary lesions, diabetes mellitus, culture negativity, a low daily physical activity level, a decreased lymphocyte count and an increased CRP level. The propensity score was calculated using these variables (C-statistic of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the propensity score: 0.807, p < 0.0001). The fluoroquinolone-containing regimens were significantly inferior to the standard regimen in clinical improvements (p = 0.002, Log-rank test) in the univariate analysis, but the significance was lost after adjusting for the propensity score (HR 0.553, 95% CI 0.285-1.074, p = 0.080). Six (21%) patients in the fluoroquinolone-containing regimen group and ten (22%) patients in the standard regimen group experienced low-grade adverse effects.There was no significant difference in clinical improvement between these regimens after propensity score adjustment. A large-scale prospective study is required to validate these results."

https://openalex.org/W3041691979,"The aim of the study was to compare the effects of a 10-week chest-press resistance training on lifting regions in a trained exercise and a none-trained exercise; the barbell bench press (BBP). Thirty-five resistance trained men with 4.2 (± 2.3) years of resistance training experience were recruited. The participants were randomized to attend a resistance program, performing the chest-press, twice per week using either, Smith machine, dumbbells or laying on Swiss ball using a barbell. A six-repetitions maximum (6RM) test was conducted pre- and post-training in the trained chest-press exercise and non-trained BBP to examine lifting velocity, load displacement and the time of the pre-sticking, sticking and post-sticking regions. Additionally, the muscle activity in pectoralis major, triceps brachii, biceps brachii and deltoid anterior was examined. In the post-test, all three chest-press groups decreased lifting velocity and increased the time to reach the sticking- and post-sticking region. Independent of the type of chest-press exercise trained, no differences were observed in vertical displacement or in the muscle activity for the three lifting regions. In general, similar changes in kinematics in trained exercise and those observed in the BBP were observed for all three groups. This indicates that none of the three chest-press exercises (Swiss ball, Smith machine or dumbbells) were specific regarding the lifting regions but displaced a transferability towards the non-trained BBP. However, improved strength altered the sticking region among resistance trained men."
https://openalex.org/W3042183104,"Flour beetles are a classic model system for studying competitive dynamics between species occupying the same ecological niche. Competitive performance is often interpreted in terms of biological species traits such as fecundity, resource use, and predation. However, many studies only measure competitive ability when species enter an environment simultaneously, and thus do not consider how the relative timing of species’ arrival may determine competitive outcome (i.e., priority effects). Whether priority effects may influence competition in Tribolium remains to be tested. The present study examined the importance of priority effects in competitions between two common species of flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae): Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum. To investigate whether priority effects confer competitive advantages to Tribolium beetles, relative introduction times of T. castaneum and T. confusum to competitive arenas were manipulated, and adult populations were measured for seven months. Four important patterns were noted: (1) Tribolium species given two-weeks priority access to experimental arenas attained larger populations than their late-arriving competitor, (2) when founding adults were introduced simultaneously, T. castaneum was competitively dominant, (3) T. castaneum benefited more from priority arrival than T. confusum, and (4) available bran resources largely predicted population decline in adult beetles toward the end of the experiment. These results suggest competitive outcome in Tribolium is not always predicted by species’ identity, and that performance could instead be determined by the timing of species’ arrivals and available resources."
https://openalex.org/W3041782262,"Background Traditional neonatal uvulectomy is unsupervised, unscientific and potentially dangerous cultural malpractice. It is often accompanied with life threatening neonatal morbidities such as infection, septicemia, anemia, aspiration and oropharyngeal injury. However, there is no current regional and even national data of its public health importance in the health care system. Therefore, this study was aimed at assessing the burden, associated factors and reasons of traditional uvulectomy among neonatal admissions at Debre Tabor General Hospital, North Central Ethiopia, from September 2018 to August 2019. Methods A quantitative cross sectional study supplemented with phenomenological study was employed on 422 mother-neonate pairs. Eight mothers who were not included in the quantitative part were involved as key informants of the qualitative study. Systematic and purposive sampling techniques were used to select study participants for the quantitative and qualitative parts of the study respectively. Multivariable logistic regressions were fitted to investigate significant predictors of traditional neonatal uvulectomy at p-value ≤ 0.05 and 95% CI. Moreover, the qualitative data were carefully transcribed, coded, screened, thematized, synthesized and then triangulated with the quantitative results. Results The burden of postuvulectomy admission was 67 (15.88%). Most of these admissions had post uvulectomy sepsis [59 (88.1%)] followed by anemia (55.23%). From multivariable analysis, factors that had significant odds of association with traditional neonatal uvulectomy include: having male neonate [AOR = 4.87; 95% CI: 1.10, 21.59], antenatal couple counseling about traditional neonatal uvulectomy [AOR = 0.053; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.35], home delivery [AOR = 6.02; 95% CI: 1.15, 31.61], postnatal couple counseling about traditional neonatal uvulectomy [AOR = 0.101; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.65], prior history of traditional neonatal uvulectomy [AOR = 7.15; 95% CI: 1.18, 43.21] and knowing at least one adverse effect of traditional neonatal uvulectomy [AOR = 0.068; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.44]. Furthermore, maternal perception of “there is no modern medicine to treat elongated and swollen neonatal uvula’ was the most explained reason to practice traditional neonatal uvulectomy. Conclusion and recommendation The burden of traditional neonatal uvulectomy was high. Fortunately, its predictors are modifiable. Therefore, several advocacy teams of neonatal health consisting of mainly women health development armies, elders, religious fathers, health professionals and criminal prosecutors should be actively mobilized against traditional neonatal uvulectomy. Besides, parental couple counseling about the adverse effects of traditional neonatal uvulectomy should be properly implemented in the routine antenatal and postnatal continuum of care in South Gondar Zone, North Central Ethiopia."

https://openalex.org/W3041949308,"Background Older emergency department (ED) patients often have complex problems and severe illnesses with a high risk of adverse outcomes. It is likely that these older patients are troubled with concerns, which might reflect their preferences and needs concerning medical care. However, data regarding this topic are lacking. Methods This study is a sub study of a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study among older medical ED patients (≥65 years). Patients or their caregivers were asked about their illness-related concerns during the first stage of the ED visit using a questionnaire. All concerns were categorized into 10 categories, and differences between patients and caregivers, and between age groups were analyzed. Odds Ratios were calculated to determine the association of the concerns for different adverse outcomes. Results Most of the 594 included patients (or their caregivers) were concerned (88%) about some aspects of their illness or their need for medical care. The most often reported concerns were about the severity of disease (43.6%), functional decline (9.4%) and dying (5.6%). Caregivers were more frequently concerned than patients (p<0.001) especially regarding the severity of disease (50.5 vs 39.6%, p = 0.016) and cognitive decline (10.8 vs. 0.3%, p <0.001). We found no difference between age groups. The concern about dying was associated with 30-day mortality (OR 2.89; 95%CI: 1.24–6.70) and the composite endpoint (intensive- or medium care admission, length of hospital stay >7 days, loss of independent living and unplanned readmission within 30 days) (OR 2.32; 95%CI: 1.12–4.82). In addition, unspecified concerns were associated with mortality (OR 1.88; 95%CI: 1.09–3.22). Conclusion The majority of older patients and especially their caregivers are concerned about their medical condition or need for medical care when they visit the ED. These concerns are associated with adverse outcomes and most likely reflect their needs regarding medical care. More attention should be paid to these concerns because they may offer opportunities to reduce anxiety and provide care that is adjusted to their needs.

https://openalex.org/W3041999903,"A major concern among universities around the world is that female students face gender bias, discrimination and related barriers in male-dominated STEM fields. To investigate this concern, we conducted a novel large-scale experiment of interactions between female and male students in one of the most important gateway courses for the Sciences and a course in which students interact one-on-one extensively throughout the term. Over the past four years, at a large public research university, we randomly paired every student enrolled in an introductory Chemistry lab (3,902 students and total N = 5,537). Using precise estimates from the experiment, we provide novel evidence that female students are not negatively affected academically by male partners. When assigned a male partner, female students do not receive lower scores or grades, and they are no more likely to drop the course or not continue in Chemistry or a STEM field. We also find that academically weaker female students are not negatively affected by male students and that female students are not negatively affected when paired with academically stronger male students. Although previous studies have documented that female students self-report experiencing gender bias from male peers in STEM, importantly, we do not find evidence that female students are negatively affected by male peers in intensive, long-term pairwise interactions in their course grades or future STEM course taking. The findings provide hopeful news for future trends in female representation in STEM fields."

https://openalex.org/W3041434943,"I finished my experiment and hurried to store my samples. I had a train to catch, and I was cutting it close. “Ugh, I should just stay in the lab to get a few more experiments done. I'm not even sure what I'll get out of the career development symposium,” I thought to myself. I had started a postdoc position 8 months earlier and needed to gather preliminary data to bulk up a fellowship application and extend my postdoc appointment. But I also knew that I needed to cultivate contacts in industry, in case I wanted to pursue a career outside academia. A friend working in biotechnology had told me, “Sometimes you need to get out of the lab to make meaningful connections.” He was right, I decided. I washed my hands and headed to the train.



> “Cultivating connections and exploring career options outside the lab proved difficult.” 

When I started my postdoc, I aimed to become a professor at a liberal arts college. But as time wore on, I had doubts. I didn't want to do a second postdoc, which I feared would be necessary to land a faculty position. My partner and I were also settled in Chicago after 5 years of juggling a long-distance relationship, so the prospect of moving to a new city didn't appeal to me.

Yet cultivating connections and exploring career options outside the lab proved difficult. My weekly calendar was always filled with seminars, student presentations, and lab meetings. I felt guilty taking time away from my work—but just as guilty about neglecting my future. So when an email circulated about the career development symposium, I signed up.

As I stood awkwardly in the lunch line that day, I chatted with a technology transfer specialist. We found a table together and met a medical science liaison, who told me about how much he enjoys communicating medical research with health care providers. That piqued my interest because I'd always enjoyed communicating science, but I hadn't seriously considered it as a career option. He told me to check out a science writing panel that afternoon, where he'd be a panelist.

A few hours later, I spotted him up on the stage. He and the other panelists—all of whom had Ph.D.s—clearly loved their jobs. They made frequent use of skills they had honed through their graduate training: critical thinking, project management, and the ability to learn quickly. I sat in the audience feeling I, too, could be a medical writer—and that it would suit me.

I knew that I needed a varied, intellectually stimulating career that would keep me on my toes. I wanted to spend time thinking about how to present data, because that's something I enjoyed doing in academia. The more I thought about it, the more I felt science communication might be the perfect fit for me.

It took me 2 months, but eventually I reached out to a medical writer who had served on the panel, and she agreed to meet for tea. As she spoke about her job at a medical communications agency, time flew by and I wanted to know more. I asked her for advice about how I could launch my own medical writing career, and she responded by asking for my resume. One week later, I had a phone interview with her agency. Two months later, I started a new job as a medical writer working alongside her.

I've been at the company for 1.5 years now, and I'm thankful I found a career that's such a good fit. I work collaboratively with my colleagues on projects that communicate medical research for our clients, mainly pharmaceutical companies. And I use many core skills from my scientific training, such as rapidly sifting through the literature to find relevant information and communicating data visually.

During my postdoc, it was challenging to figure out where my career path would take me next. For me, the catalyst was talking to people. I realize it can be hard to get out and network in person these days. But virtual networking is always an option—and you won't even have to worry about missing a train."
https://openalex.org/W3041884868,"Decades of microbiome studies, using a combination of multiomics approaches, have revealed strong associations between microbiota and human health. The next step is to identify the causal molecular mechanisms behind this association: Which microbes, genes, and their metabolites, if any, are responsible for a host phenotype? And if these molecules do affect us, how can we modulate their concentrations in the host to promote gut health?



Uncovering the causal relationship between a gut microbe and its host's biology at the level of molecular mechanisms is challenging, largely because we lack an efficient way to manipulate gut microbial genes. More than 90,000 gut bacterial metagenomes have been identified ([ 1 ][1]), and thousands of bacteria have been isolated and their genomes sequenced, but less than 5% of the species are genetically tractable. New tools are in great need for these non-model gut microbes.

The gut microbiota modulates host biology in multiple ways. A substantial contribution to this regulation comes from microbiome-derived metabolites. Like a hormone released by an endocrine gland, these molecules have three notable features: They are exclusively released by the gut microbes, some are highly abundant and circulatory, and some are ligands for host receptors.

My research focuses on dissecting the molecular mechanisms behind the interaction between microbiota metabolites and human health. I have a strong interest in developing new genetic tools for human gut Clostridium isolates, toggling the expression of microbiota genes and concentrations of metabolites in the host, and studying their effects on human health and diseases. My long-term goal is to understand and eventually reprogram the molecular “language” of host-microbe interactions for therapeutic applications.

Previous efforts to study a microbiome-derived molecule in the host used two main strategies: introducing a compound by injection or gavage, or modulating a bacterial species that produces the target metabolite. Both approaches provide insight into the mechanism of biological function but lack a clean background or control (i.e., the physiological concentration of the target metabolite, or other biological activities of the added bacteria).

In my lab, we believe the most precise format for investigating a microbiome-derived metabolite in the host is to compare two organisms that differ only in its production. Such an experiment requires knowledge of the metabolic genes responsible for the metabolite and genetic tools for a robustly producing gut microbe. However, a key technical barrier limiting the method's generalization is that many high-abundance gut-derived molecules are produced by Clostridium and its relatives, which have been notoriously resistant to genetic manipulation.

In this work, we started by introducing the CRISPR-Cas9 system into a gut microbe, Clostridium sporogenes ([ 2 ][2]). C. sporogenes is a gut commensal commonly found in healthy humans that produces many fermentation metabolites entering the host's circulation. Although many CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been established in mammalian cells and in bacteria like Escherichia coli , the genetics of which are well characterized, building such a system in C. sporogenes is not at all straightforward.

Clostridium and its relatives are notoriously resistant to genetic manipulation, largely because there is no efficient approach for introducing extracellular DNA and most Clostridium have a very low endogenous homologous recombination frequency, which further limits the applicability of a CRISPR-Cas9 system. After struggling for over 9 months with no viable colonies, I found that the guide RNA and Cas9 components needed to be introduced separately into C. sporogenes to promote efficient extracellular DNA uptake and homologous recombination. This allowed us to identify and mutate the metabolic genes of more than 10 C. sporogenes –fermented metabolites. By monocolonizing germ-free mice with the C. sporogenes mutants and the wild-type strain, we can modulate the amount of these metabolites in the host.

Although it is well known that microbiome metabolites like propionate and butyrate are host GPCR (G protein–coupled receptor) ligands that modulate immune functions by inducing intestinal regulatory T cells ([ 3 ][3]), little is known about structurally similar branched short-chain fatty acids (BSCFAs) and their biology. The system that we developed enabled us to interrogate BSCFA biology in two groups of mice that differed only in their BSCFAs and the responsible metabolic gene. We found that BSCFAs suppress intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) plasma cells as well as the concentrations of IgA bound to the surface of a variety of innate immune cells, suggesting a previously unrecognized role for the BSCFAs in regulating IgA-related immune cell biology.

A healthy human gut is filled with trillions of microbes, but less than 5% of them can be genetically manipulated. We plan to build a general workflow that facilitates the development of genetic tools for these previously genetically inaccessible gut microbes. Considering that many microbiome-modulated biological phenotypes require the colonization of a complex microbiota, we further aim to assemble a genetically tractable yet phylogenetically diverse gut consortium. If successful, this system will greatly expedite the characterization of the causal molecular mechanisms behind microbiota-human interaction and will also lay the basis for engineering a gut microbiome to promote human gut health and to prevent and cure diseases.

https://openalex.org/W3041980073,"Decisions surrounding the presence of infectious diseases are typically made in the face of considerable uncertainty. However, the development of models to guide these decisions has been substantially constrained by computational difficulty. This paper focuses on the case of finding the optimal level of surveillance against a highly infectious animal disease where time, space and randomness are fully considered. We apply the Sample Average Approximation approach to solve our problem, and to control model dimension, we propose the use of an infection tree model, in combination with sensible ‘tree-pruning’ and parallel processing techniques. Our proposed model and techniques are generally applicable to a number of disease types, but we demonstrate the approach by solving for optimal surveillance levels against foot-and-mouth disease using bulk milk testing as an active surveillance protocol, during an epidemic, among 42,279 farms, fully characterised by their location, livestock type and size, in the state of Victoria, Australia."
