Unexpectedly, the reduced tripeptide was instead quantitatively recovered in the incubation medium of the cells. As GSH loss was blocked by bromosulfophthalein and dibromosulfophthalein, known inhibitors of hepatocyte GSH transport, a specific export rather than nonspecific leakiness through plasma membranes is proposed to be responsible. Apoptosis was delayed when GSH-diethylesters were used to elevate intracellular GSH, although the high capacity of the activated efflux system quickly negated the benefit of this treatment. Stimulation of GSH efflux provides a novel mechanism whereby Fas/APO-1 ligation can deplete GSH. We speculate that it enhances the oxidative tonus of a responding cell without requiring an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species.

These include chromatin fragmentation, plasma membrane blebbing, and an overall cell shrinkage, eventually culminating in either the phagocytosis or lysis of the apoptotic cell. There have also been numerous reports that apoptotic cells accumulate oxidized proteins and lipids and are presumably therefore exposed to some degree of oxidative stress (4Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Google Scholar). In addition, antioxidants have been widely reported to protect against, or delay, many different forms of apoptosis (5Slater A.F.G. Nobel C.S.I. Orrenius S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 59-62Google Scholar). However, several recent reports of apparently normal apoptosis occurring in very low oxygen environments indicate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are unlikely to be essential mediators of this type of cell death (6Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C.

Human JURKAT T lymphocytes are rapidly induced to undergo apoptosis after exposure to anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody (9Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J.

One of the earliest detectable events downstream of ligand-receptor binding is activation after 15 min of the ICE-like protease CPP-32/apopain (12Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Google Scholar). Plasma membrane blebbing and degradation of the cytoskeleton commence soon after, while chromatin breakdown is first detectable at 45 min with internucleosomal DNA fragments beginning to accumulate after approximately 90 min (14Weiss M. Schlegel J. Kass G.E.N. Holmström T.H. Peters I. Eriksson J. Orrenius S. Chow S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 699-708Google Scholar). Gross alterations in plasma membrane permeability develop several hours later. Although it has been reported that these changes occur with similar kinetics independently of ambient oxygen tension (6Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Google Scholar), the possibility remains that oxygen-independent modification of intracellular redox states are involved in these events. To further understand this controversial area, the glutathione metabolism of JURKAT cells exposed to anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody was investigated. Consistent with results in thymocytes (15Slater A.F.G. Nobel C.S.I. Maellaro E. Bustamante J. Kimland M. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 771-778Google Scholar, 16Beaver J.P. Waring P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 47-54Google Scholar), T lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis became dramatically depleted of their reduced glutathione (GSH) coincident with the onset of chromatin fragmentation. Unexpectedly, this was caused by an accelerated efflux of GSH from the cells rather than any intracellular oxidation of the tripeptide. As GSH efflux was inhibited by bromosulfophthalein (BSP) and dibromosulfophthalein (diBSP), known inhibitors of the GSH transporter located on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes (17Ballatori N. Dutczak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19731-19737Google Scholar), the selective opening of a GSH-specific membrane channel is proposed to be responsible. Severe depletion of GSH will lower the reducing capacity of the cell and thereby enhance oxidative stress independent of any increase in the production of ROS. The human leukemic T cell line JURKAT (clone E6) was obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, and 100 IU penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. For experiments the cells were suspended at 4 × 106 cells·ml−1. Where indicated the cells were cultured in cystine-free RPMI medium supplemented as above. Monoclonal IgM anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone, monobromobimane, and glutathione diethylester were purchased from Medical Biological Laboratories, Enzyme System Products, Calbiochem and Bachem, respectively. The glutathione transport inhibitors BSP and phenol-3,6-dibromophthalein disulfonate = diBSP were purchased from Aldrich and Société d'Etudes et Recherches Biologiques (Paris), respectively, while a bromosulfophthalein-glutathione conjugate (BSP-GSH) was synthesized and purified according to Whelan et al. (18Whelan G. Hoch J. Combes B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1970; 75: 542-557Google Scholar). The final BSP-GSH product was contaminated with less than 0.8% BSP as determined by TLC. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Plasma membrane integrity was monitored either by release of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase or using the Live-Dead cytotoxicity kit supplied by Molecular Probes. The ability of cells to reduce an exogenous substrate was assayed by adding 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 1 mg·ml−1) into their incubation medium. Formazan production was measured 40–60 min later in a spectrophotometer (592 nm) after first lysing the cells in 0.5% SDS, 40 mM HCl in 90% isopropanol. High molecular weight chromatin fragments were detected by field inversion gel electrophoresis (19Brown D.G. Sun X.-M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3037-3039Google Scholar). DNA extracted from approximately 0.2 × 106 cells was electrophoresed using the conditions described in Nobel et al. (20Nobel C.S.I. Kimland M. Lind B. Orrenius S. Slater A.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26202-26208Google Scholar). DNA migration on the gels was calibrated with Pulse-marker™ molecular weight standards (Sigma). Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was quantitated by the diphenylamine assay (21Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Google Scholar) and visualized using the agarose gel electrophoresis protocol described by Wyllie et al. (22Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Google Scholar). Intracellular GSH was assayed using monobromobimane as described by Cotgreave and Moldéus (23Cotgreave I.A. Moldéus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Google Scholar). In short, 4 × 105 cells were collected and washed in 1 ml of isotonic buffer (24 mM NaHCO3, 110 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 7.2) and centrifuged for 6 min at 700 × g. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet resuspended in 100 µl of buffer. An equal volume of 8 mM monobromobimane in 50 mM N-ethylmorpholine, pH 8.0, was added and the sample allowed to stand 3 min in the dark. Protein was then precipitated by adding 10 µl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g the low molecular weight thiols in the supernatant were analyzed by HPLC. In several experiments protein thiols in the pellet were also quantitated relative to a BSA standard (23Cotgreave I.A. Moldéus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Google Scholar). For simultaneous determination of reduced and oxidized intracellular glutathione, 2.5 × 106 cells were washed twice and precipitated for 2 h in 350 µl of 5% perchloric acid, 0.2 M boric acid. Protein was removed by centrifugation, and primary amines in the supernatant derivatized with dansyl chloride after first alkylating free thiols with iodoacetic acid. The dansylated derivatives of GSH and GSSG were then separated by HPLC essentially as described by Fariss and Reed (24Fariss M.W. Reed D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 101-109Google Scholar) for the corresponding dinitrophenol adducts. To measure GSH in the culture medium, 6 × 105 cells (150 µl total volume) were centrifuged and two 60-µl aliquots of the supernatant collected. One was derivatized immediately with 8 mM monobromobimane, whereas the other was first reduced with 5 mM DTT before derivatization with 30 mM monobromobimane (23Cotgreave I.A. Moldéus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Google Scholar). In order to facilitate detection of reduced thiols some experiments were also performed in a cystine-free RPMI medium. The intracellular GSH content of human JURKAT T lymphocytes was observed to fall after exposure to anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody (Fig. 1A). This GSH loss began after a lag period of approximately 30 min and was almost complete by 3 h. In five independent experiments the half-life of intracellular GSH following addition of 250 ng·ml−1 anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody was 59 ± 6 min (mean ± S.D.). This loss occurred before the rate of cellular MTT reduction fell, while the plasma membrane of antibody-treated cells continued to exclude ethidium homodimers for at least another 3 h (Fig. 1A). Additionally, leakage of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium was not detectable until at least 3 h after adding the antibody (data not shown). In pulse-field gel electrophoresis, high molecular weight chromatin fragments were first apparent between 45 and 60 min after adding the antibody (Fig. 1B). We conclude that GSH rapidly disappears from JURKAT cells at an early time point during Fas/APO-1-stimulated apoptosis before any gross leakiness of the plasma membrane develops. GSH depletion is commonly observed when cells are oxidatively stressed (25Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Google Scholar). It can usually be detected by measurement of transient increases in the intracellular content of either glutathione disulfide (GSSG) or protein-glutathione mixed disulfides (26Akerboom T. Sies H. Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 45Google Scholar, 27Bellomo G. Mirabelli F. DiMonte D. Richelmi P. Thor H. Orrenius C. Orrenius S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1313-1320Google Scholar, 28Schuppe I. Moldeus P. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1757-1764Google Scholar). However despite a massive and rapid GSH loss, we have been consistently unable to detect any changes in the intracellular concentrations of these two oxidized forms of glutathione after exposing JURKAT cells to an anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody (Fig. 2 and data not shown, respectively). Thus, the glutathione that disappears from the GSH pool of the antibody-treated cells is not recovered in another redox form within the cell. Cellular GSH levels result from an equilibrium between the rates of synthesis and loss of the tripeptide via oxidation or excretion (29Meister A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1969s-1975sGoogle Scholar). Declining GSH levels in the absence of oxidation can potentially result either from an increased efflux out of the cell or a reduced rate of uptake of precursors and subsequent re-synthesis. Several experiments were therefore designed to discriminate between these possibilities. When GSH biosynthesis was blocked, either by chemical inhibition of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (with buthionine sulfoximine) or by cysteine deprivation (by culturing cells in cystine-free medium), intracellular GSH levels decreased by about 50% after 6 h in each case (Fig. 3). In comparison, treatment with anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody induced a much more rapid drop in GSH levels. Lymphoid cells have also been reported to salvage excreted glutathione via the activity of the plasma membrane enzyme γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (30Griffith O.W. Novogrodsky A. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2249-2252Google Scholar, 31Dethmers J.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7492-7496Google Scholar). However, inhibition of this enzyme using either 2.5 mM anthglutin or AT-125 again caused a much slower fall in intracellular GSH (32 and 30% decrease, respectively, after 4 h; data not shown). These experiments indicate that the decrease of GSH in JURKAT cells after treatment with anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody is too rapid to be accounted for by an inhibition of precursor uptake or biosynthesis. It is more likely that its rate of excretion is increased in response to stimulation of the Fas/APO-1 cell surface receptor. Two approaches were adopted to investigate the possibility that the tripeptide was being extruded from cells. First, cells were depleted of intracellular GSH by incubation in a cystine-free medium (GSH content falls to approximately 40% of control levels after 6 h; see Fig. 3) and then allowed to resynthesize the tripeptide by adding 200 µM [35S]cystine. GSH levels recovered (and actually slightly overshot) control levels within 3 h (data not shown). Anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody was then added to the cells and radioactivity in the incubation medium monitored. Extracellular 35S increased markedly 40–70 min after adding the antibody, suggesting that labeled cysteinyl groups were being expelled from the cells (Fig. 4A). In a more direct experiment, the incubation medium of cells was collected at various times after adding anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody and then reduced with DTT and derivatized with monobromobimane prior to analysis by HPLC. (NB, Due to a rapid thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine, GSH has a half-life of less than 3 min in standard RPMI medium. Reduction with DTT is therefore required before GSH can be detected as a monobromobimane conjugate.) Glutathione was quantitatively recovered in the incubation medium co-incident with its disappearance from the antibody-treated cells (Fig. 4C). We conclude that JURKAT cells exposed to anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody expel a large fraction of their intracellular GSH during the first hour of their treatment. This phenomenon occurs at about the same time as chromatin begins to be cleaved but several hours before any gross increase in plasma membrane leakiness. Although the experiments described above identify an anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody-induced accumulation of intact glutathione outside cells, they do not allow identification of the redox form (GSH or GSSG) actually transported. To investigate this issue cells were incubated in cystine-free medium to prevent thiol-disulfide exchange between GSH and cystine. A small depletion of intracellular GSH, therefore, directly results from cystine withdrawal, as can clearly be seen at the later time points in the untreated cells (Fig. 5A). Consistent with previous studies in other lymphoid cells (31Dethmers J.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7492-7496Google Scholar), untreated JURKAT T lymphocytes were observed to only very slowly release GSH into the culture medium (Fig. 5A). GSH release from anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody-treated cells remained at background levels for the first 30 min, but then dramatically increased coincident with its loss from the intracellular compartment (Fig. 5B). Almost all of the GSH lost from the cells was quantitatively recovered in the medium. In addition, small amounts of the GSH breakdown products cysteinyl-glycine and cysteine were also detected (not shown). During the initial phase of glutathione release, there was no difference in the efficiency of trapping GSH as its monobromobimane conjugate in the presence or absence of DTT, indicating that it was present in its reduced form at this time. As GSSG added to culture medium is not spontaneously reduced (data not shown), these results can only be explained by glutathione being exported from the Fas/APO-1-stimulated cells as an intact reduced tripeptide. At later time points some recovery of oxidized thiol was also recorded (illustrated by the difference in amount of GSH measured before and after DTT reduction; Fig. 5B). This is likely to be secondary to a slow oxidation of extracellular GSH in the cystine-free medium. To investigate whether GSH efflux was activated by the same proteolytic cascade believed to initiate apoptotic chromatin fragmentation, JURKAT cells were preincubated with Z-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone, an irreversible inhibitor of ICE family proteases (32Dolle R.E. Hoyer D. Prasad C.V.C. Schmidt S.J. Helaszek C.T. Miller R.E. Ator M.A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 563-564Google Scholar). Consistent with reports by Enari et al. (10Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Google Scholar) and Los et al. (33Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Dröge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Google Scholar), inhibiting the activity of this protease family was found to prevent both the fall in MTT reduction and the increase in DNA fragmentation that occurs after cells are exposed to anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody (Table I). Irrespective of the presence of the antibody, intracellular GSH levels were also fully maintained when Z-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone was included in the preincubation medium (Table I). This indicates that the rapid efflux of GSH observed after stimulation of the Fas/APO-1 receptor is a distinct cytoplasmic event directly or indirectly activated by a member of the ICE family of cysteine proteases.Table IGSH loss following exposure to anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody is prevented by an inhibitor of ICE-like proteasesCellsMTT reductionSoluble DNAGSH% of control% of totalnmol·mg−1proteinUntreated1007 ± 130.0 ± 0.7Untreated + Z-Val-Ala-Asp-cmk102 ± 47 ± 129.2 ± 1.1Anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody24 ± 187 ± 21.6 ± 0.1Anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody + Z-Val-Ala-Asp-cmk99 ± 57 ± 126.9 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab Several GSH-specific transporters located in both plasma and mitochondrial membranes of cells have been described previously (34Fernández-Checa J.

Fernández-Checa J. Kaplowitz N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1495-1499Google Scholar). Rat hepatocytes are the best characterized cell system with respect to this type of transporter. The sinusoidal membrane of rat hepatocytes contains a GSH transporter distinguished by its sensitivity to L-methionine, cystathionine, and the BSP-GSH conjugate (34Fernández-Checa J. Yi J.-R. Garcia-Ruiz C. Knezic Z. Tahara S.M. Kaplowitz N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2324-2328Google Scholar, 37Yi J.-R. Lu S. Fernández-Checa J. Kaplowitz N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1993; 265: G1128-G1134Google Scholar), while their canalicular plasma membranes contain both high affinity/low capacity and low affinity/high capacity GSH transporters that are inhibited by BSP and diBSP (17Ballatori N. Dutczak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19731-19737Google Scholar, 39Ballatori N. Clarkson T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G238-G245Google Scholar). When BSP was applied to untreated JURKAT cells, intracellular GSH was slowly depleted (Fig. 6A), presumably due to the previously reported glutathione S-transferase catalyzed conjugation of BSP and GSH (40Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Google Scholar). We therefore concentrated on studying the effects of BSP on anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody-induced GSH efflux during short incubations (30–60 min). Under these conditions, BSP was observed to give a concentration-dependent inhibition of GSH efflux from cells exposed to the antibody, with an EC50 of approximately 100 µM (Fig. 6A). This closely resembles the concentration at which BSP inhibits the hepatocyte canalicular membrane GSH transporter (17Ballatori N. Dutczak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19731-19737Google Scholar). Compared with BSP, the analog diBSP is a relatively poor substrate for glutathione S-transferases, and therefore leaves the intracellular GSH levels of control cells unaffected for a longer time (Fig. 6B). 2 mM diBSP completely inhibited the anti-Fas/APO-1-induced decrease in intracellular GSH for up to 2 h (Fig. 6B), although in longer incubations it again slowly depleted GSH from otherwise untreated cells (data not shown). These experiments suggest that a GSH transporter with inhibitor sensitivity resembling the hepatocyte canalicular GSH transporter is activated in JURKAT cells undergoing apoptosis in response to stimulation of Fas/APO-1. To further identify the characteristics of this inducible GSH transport, the effects of other known inhibitors of various GSH transporters were studied. Inhibitors of the liver sinusoidal membrane GSH transporter, such as L-methionine and cystathionine (34Fernández-Checa J. Yi J.-R. Garcia-Ruiz C. Knezic Z. Tahara S.M. Kaplowitz N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2324-2328Google Scholar, 37Yi J.-R. Lu S. Fernández-Checa J. Kaplowitz N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1495-1499Google Scholar, 38Sze G. Kaplowitz N. Ookhtens M. Lu S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G1128-G1134Google Scholar), failed to inhibit the Fas/APO-1-induced loss of intracellular GSH (Table II). In contrast, another inhibitor of the sinusoidal membrane GSH transporter, the BSP-GSH conjugate, did partially inhibit GSH efflux (Table II). However, as Ballatori and Dutczak (17Ballatori N. Dutczak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19731-19737Google Scholar) have shown that this agent also has some inhibitory effects on GSH transport in canalicular liver membrane vesicles, the absolute specificity of this reagent is unclear. It is also possible that GSH transport in JURKAT T cells has some difference in its profile of inhibitor sensitivity compared with the better characterized rat hepatocyte model. Neither GSSG nor any of the six S-alkylglutathione conjugates tested were able to significantly inhibit GSH loss in response to antibody treatment (Table III). These negative results exclude both the high affinity/low capacity canalicular GSH transporter and the multidrug resistance-associated protein from being involved (17Ballatori N. Dutczak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19731-19737Google Scholar, 41Müller M. Meijer C. Zaman G.J.R. Borst P. Scheper R.J. Mulder N.H. De Vries E.G.E. Jansen P.L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 7690-7694Google Scholar). As the low affinity/high capacity canalicular-like GSH-transporter (in contrast to the transporter on sinusoidal membranes) is also present in numerous other cell types (35Yi J.-R. Lu S.

Open table in a new tab The protective effect of BSP and diBSP against GSH efflux were lost after longer incubation (>2 h), while both compounds also slowly depleted intracellular GSH by direct conjugation. We were therefore unable to determine whether they improve the long term viability of cells exposed to anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody (JURKATS retain their membrane integrity for at least 4 h after the addition of antibody; see Fig. 1A). Furthermore, BSP and diBSP directly interfere with the MTT assay such that it was not possible to use this method to search for any protective effects of inhibiting GSH transport on cellular reducing capacity. However, diBSP could be used to investigate the effect of maintaining normal GSH levels on DNA degradation induced by ligation of Fas/APO-1. In two experiments, although GSH depletion in anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody-treated cells was almost completely prevented in the presence of 2 mM diBSP (Fig. 6B), apoptotic degradation of nuclear DNA in the same cells was indistinguishable in the presence or absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 7). The BSP-GSH conjugate also failed to inhibit chromatin fragmentation. Thus, inhibition of GSH efflux has no apparent effect on the kinetics of DNA degradation in these cells. Although glutathione itself is relatively poor at permeating into normal lymphoid cells, intracellular levels can be elevated by incubation with diethylesters of the tripeptide (44Levy E.J. Anderson M.E. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9171-9175Google Scholar). This method provided a less toxic alternative than BSP/diBSP to investigate whether manipulation of intracellular glutathione concentration would have any impact on anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody-induced apoptosis. Preincubating JURKAT cells for 1 h with 20 mM glutathione diethylester was found to consistently elevate intracellular GSH about 4-fold (Fig. 8A; using the HPLC conditions of Levy et al. (44Levy E.J. Anderson M.E. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9171-9175Google Scholar), both diethyl- and particularly monoethyl-GSH can also be detected inside the cells). After addition of anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody, a significant delay was observed in the rate at which the GSH-loaded cells underwent apoptosis. For example, their ability to reduce MTT was maintained for about 50–60 min longer than in unloaded cells (Fig. 8A), while cleavage of their chromatin into 200- and 50-kilobase pair fragments was delayed by about 30–40 min (data not shown). However, consistent with the findings of Hug et al. (45Hug H. Enari M. Nagata S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 311-313Google Scholar), raising intracellular GSH had no overall inhibitory effect on apoptosis in this system. A partial explanation for this can be seen in Fig. 8B. After addition of anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody, GSH was exported from the glutathione diethylester-treated cells severalfold faster than from unloaded cells. Any benefit gained by starting with elevated intracellular GSH was, therefore, rapidly dissipated by the high capacity GSH-effluxing system activated after antibody treatment of these cells. A depletion of intracellular GSH has been reported to occur in several different apoptotic systems (15Slater A.F.G. Nobel C.S.I. Maellaro E. Bustamante J. Kimland M. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 771-778Google Scholar, 16Beaver J.P. Waring P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 47-54Google Scholar, 46Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Maresca V. Ciriolo M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 313-320Google Scholar). For example, thymocytes undergoing apoptosis after exposure to glucocorticoid hormone or DNA damaging agents loose intracellular GSH with similar kinetics to internucleosomal chromatin fragmentation (15Slater A.F.G. Nobel C.S.I. Maellaro E. Bustamante J. Kimland M. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 771-778Google Scholar). It is usually assumed that GSH depletion reflects an intracellular oxidation, although direct evidence for an increased production of ROS or other radicals in cells undergoing apoptosis has been difficult to obtain. The results presented here suggest a different interpretation: GSH is directly exported from a cell undergoing apoptosis via activation of a transmembrane channel rather than depleted by oxidation. Consistent with our findings, Ghibelli et al. (46Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Maresca V. Ciriolo M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 313-320Google Scholar) have recently reported glutathione extrusion from U937 cells triggered to undergo apoptosis by puromycin or etoposide, although interpretation of their data is complicated by the large amounts of cell lysis also occurring. In Fas/APO-1-stimulated JURKAT cells activation of GSH efflux is apparently under the control (direct or indirect) of cytoplasmic proteases related to ICE. If GSH efflux and a resulting shift in intracellular GSH:GSSG redox state can be shown to occur in other apoptotic systems, it may represent a common mechanism by which activation of ICE-like proteases induces oxidative stress in the absence of an increased production of ROS. The physiological benefit of rapid GSH export during Fas/APO-1-stimulated apoptosis is unknown, although several possibilities can be imagined. First, it may be necessary for a responding cell to lose reducing capacity, and that the least damaging way of achieving this is to export the most important cytosolic antioxidant rather than to generate oxidants with their attendant nonspecific reactivities. As external antioxidants would be expected to lessen the impact of GSH depletion, this could also explain why they are sometimes observed to delay cell death in this system (47Matsuda M. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Miyajima S. Yamauchi A. Yonehara S. Uchida A. Irimajiri K. Horiuchi A. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3837-3841Google Scholar). However, it must be stressed that supplementing intracellular GSH does not protect against apoptosis induced by anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody (45Hug H. Enari M. Nagata S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 311-313Google Scholar; see results presented here). At least in JURKAT cells this can be explained by their high capacity for GSH efflux rapidly removing any benefit that might be gained by having an elevated intracellular GSH content (Fig. 8B). We rather propose that GSH efflux is one of several cytoplasmic events activated during Fas/APO-1-stimulated cell death and that it contributes to optimal functioning of the overall process. Second, GSH export may be of nutritional significance for normal cells surrounding an apoptotic neighbor (the anti-FAS/APO-1 antibody-induced apoptosis studied in this paper is nonphysiological in the sense that almost all of the cells die in synchrony). GSH released into plasma would be a substrate for lymphocyte plasma membrane γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and thereby rapidly become available for re-uptake into other cells. Reducing agents (particularly 2-mercaptoethanol) are widely known to enhance the function of lymphoid cells in vitro (48Pruett S.B. Higginbotham J.N. Kiel J.L. Immunobiology. 1989; 179: 308-313Google Scholar). It is, therefore, possible that GSH efflux is valuable in locally stimulating the activity of phagocytic cells in vivo. Finally, as a minimum concentration of intracellular GSH is required for mitochondrial function (29Meister A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1969s-1975sGoogle Scholar), GSH depletion will eventually limit the ability of apoptotic cells to maintain ATP levels. As continued ATP production is required to maintain cell membrane integrity, GSH depletion may, therefore, contribute to an eventual lysis of apoptotic cells (this is often observed in vitro when phagocytes are absent). GSH efflux after ligation of Fas/APO-1 on the surface of T lymphocytes may also be of physiological importance during viral infection. There is now convincing evidence that T lymphocytes infected with the human immunodeficiency virus exhibit an enhanced susceptibility to undergo apoptosis (49Gougeon M.-L. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 1-8Google Scholar, 50Ameisen J.C. Estaquier J. Idziorek T. De Bels F. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 9-22Google Scholar). GSH levels in circulating T lymphocytes of patients infected with this virus are also reported to be significantly lower than normal (51Eck H.-P. Gmünder H. Hartmann M. Petzoldt D. Daniel V. Dröge W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 101-108Google Scholar, 52Staal F.J.T. Ela S.W. Roederer M. Anderson M.T. Herzenberg L.A. Lancet. 1992; 339: 909-912Google Scholar). This is usually attributed to an increase in the amount of oxidative stress experienced by these cells. For example, the Tat protein, known to be secreted from human immunodeficiency virus-infected cells, can permeate into uninfected lymphocytes and reduce both expression and activity of the mitochondrial enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (53Flores S.C. Marecki J.C. Harper K.P. Bose S.K. Nelson S.K. McCord J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7632-7636Google Scholar, 54Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Google Scholar). In JURKAT T lymphocytes this has been shown to correlate with decreased levels of intracellular GSH (54Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Google Scholar). However, in view of the recent finding that the Fas/APO-1 system may be activated during human immunodeficiency virus infection (55Westendorp M.O. Shatrov V.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Frank R. Kraft M. Los M. Krammer P.H. Dröge W. Lehmann V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Google Scholar), it is also possible that an associated enhancement of GSH efflux contributes to a depletion of the tripeptide during this infection. Alternatively, lowering intracellular GSH levels (again perhaps by increasing efflux) could represent an innate response of lymphocytes to viral infection. The probability of the host cell undergoing apoptotic death following stimulation of the FAS/APO-1 receptor would thereby be increased and overall viral replication in the infected organism lowered. In summary, GSH levels have been observed to fall coincident with the onset of apoptosis in different systems. We show that in a human T cell anti-Fas/APO-1 system accelerated GSH efflux is the major cause of GSH loss during apoptosis. Furthermore, we propose that a plasma membrane GSH transporter with properties resembling the hepatocyte canalicular membrane low affinity/high capacity GSH transporter is the channel responsible for this phenomenon. Further understanding of the mechanism and physiological significance of this event will contribute to the biochemical understanding of apoptotic cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2013967645,"The type 1A angiotensin II receptor (AT1A-R), which mediates cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II, has been shown to undergo rapid agonist-induced desensitization. We investigated the potential role of second messenger-activated kinases and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) in the regulation of this receptor. In 293 cells transfected with the AT1A-R, a 3-min challenge with angiotensin II engendered a 46% decrease in subsequent angiotensin II-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in intact cells. This agonist-induced desensitization correlated temporally and dose-dependently with the phosphorylation of the receptor to a stoichiometry of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor, as assessed by immunoprecipitation of receptors from cells metabolically labeled with 32Pi. Agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation was reduced by 40-50% by either overexpression of a dominant negative K220R mutant GRK2 or treatment of the cells with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine, in a virtually additive fashion. Cellular overexpression of GRK2K220R not only inhibited agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation, but also prevented receptor desensitization, as assessed by angiotensin II-stimulated GTPase activity in membranes prepared from agonist-treated and control cells. In contrast, PKC inhibition by staurosporine did not affect homologous desensitization of the AT1A-R. Overexpression of GRKs 2, 3, or 5 significantly augmented the agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation 1.5- to 1.7-fold (p < 0.001).

Agonist binding to a G protein-coupled receptor activates catalytic cascades of intracellular mediators which greatly amplify the response to an extracellular stimulus. In many instances, this same event triggers counter-regulatory pathways which attenuate receptor signaling (1Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Several distinct, yet highly coordinated mechanisms act together to bring about receptor desensitization. Rapid agonist-specific or homologous desensitization is due to the functional uncoupling of the heterotrimeric G protein from the receptor. On a molecular level, phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptors by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 1The abbreviations used are: GRKG protein-coupled receptor kinase293 cellshuman embryonic kidney cellsAT1-Rtype 1 angiotensin II receptorAT1A-Rtype 1A angiotensin II receptorβARKβ-adrenergic receptor kinaseG proteinguanine nucleotide-binding proteinPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. or by second messenger-activated kinases have been shown to attenuate receptor interaction with G proteins (2Lefkowitz R.J.

This study focuses on the vascular type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1 -R), which has long been known to undergo rapid desensitization (3Peach M.J. Fisher J.W. Kidney Hormones. Academic Press, New York1986: 273Google Scholar). Most of the known effects of angiotensin II, the major effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system, are mediated via this receptor (reviewed in Ref. 4Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 28: 269-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two different, highly homologous subtypes (AT1A-R and AT1B-R) of this receptor were identified in rat and mouse by cloning experiments. Although functionally and pharmacologically indistinguishable from the AT1B-R, the AT1A-R is the predominant form in most tissues including the kidney, heart, liver, and aorta (5Gasc J.-M. Shanmugam S. Sibony M. Corvol P. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Modulation of the AT1A-R gene in mice by gene targeting experiments has lent further support to the notion that angiotensin II exerts its hemodynamic effects mainly by the type 1A angiotensin II receptor (6Ito M. Oliverio M.J. Mannon P.J. Best C.F. Maeda N. Smithies O. Coffmann T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3521-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have provided evidence that rapid desensitization of the AT1-R involves G protein uncoupling and receptor phosphorylation. First, short-term desensitization of the AT1-R in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells was found to correspond to a shift in receptor affinity for agonist from high (G protein-coupled) to low (uncoupled) (7Boulay G. Chretien L. Richard D.E. Guillemette G. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2130-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As GTPγS mimicked this effect, it was concluded that agonist-induced desensitization results from the uncoupling of AT1-R from its G protein. Second, the AT1-R in rat vascular smooth muscle cells was demonstrated to be phosphorylated in response to agonist stimulation (8Kai H. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Ollerenshaw J.D. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, neither the kinases which phosphorylate the receptor nor the functional consequences of receptor phosphorylation were directly addressed. The present study was designed to determine whether G protein-coupled receptor kinases and/or second messenger-activated kinases phosphorylate and desensitize the AT1A-R in intact cells. To this end, effects of kinase inhibitors on receptor phosphorylation and desensitization were studied. Finally, we asked whether individual GRKs can phosphorylate the AT1A-R. Three members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, i.e. GRK2 (βARK1), GRK3 (βARK2), and GRK5, were chosen for this study on the basis of their widespread tissue expression (9Inglese J.

The reaction was stopped with 0.4 M perchloric acid. Total inositol phosphates were extracted and separated by anion exchange chromatography as described (16Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J.

Transfected cells were incubated (1 h/4°C) with a 100-fold dilution of the 12CA5 ascites (65 µg of IgG/ml) in PBS, 1% gelatin, 20 mM NaN3, washed with the same buffer by centrifugation, and labeled (1 h/4°C) with a 1:100 dilution of a goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were analyzed using a Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer by setting quadrants which resulted in less than 5% staining of untransfected control cells. The relative expression of AT1A-R by cells used in a single assay was determined by multiplying the fraction of cells staining positive for AT1A-R by the mean fluorescence of positive cells. Receptor internalization was determined by the same procedure after incubation of cells with or without 100 nM angiotensin II for 3 min at 37°C. Incubation was stopped by placing the cells on ice and rapidly washing them once with ice-cold PBS and 50 mM glycine, 150 mM NaCl, pH 3.0, respectively. 293 cells which transiently expressed AT1A-R from two confluent 150-mm dishes were scraped in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing protease inhibitors (2 mM EDTA, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml benzamidine, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and lysed by sonication (15 s/100 watts). Following centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g, membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in binding buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 plus protease inhibitors). Membranes (1 mg in 0.5 ml of binding buffer) were incubated with 5 µCi of [Sar1,125I-Tyr4,Val5,D-(4′-N3)Phe8]angiotensin II (specific activity 2150 Ci/mmol). After a 30-min incubation in the dark at 30°C, the membranes were washed twice by centrifugation and UV-irradiated at 254 nm for 30 min. Membranes were washed once and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Three days after transfection, 293 cells in 6-well dishes were washed once with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated at 37°C for 60 to 90 min in the same medium containing 32Pi (150 µCi/ml). Okadaic acid (1 µM) was added 10 min prior to cellular stimulation. Following the addition of different stimuli as indicated, cells were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS and scraped in lysis buffer (0.8 ml per well) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM disodium pyrophosphate plus protease inhibitors). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 20 min. After removal of aliquots for protein determinations, equal volumes of cell lysates were precleared (1 h/4°C) with 1% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose in the presence of 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Epitope-tagged AT1A-R were immunoprecipitated by incubating (2 h/4°C) lysates with 13 µg of 12CA5 IgG and 1% protein A-Sepharose. After five washes with ice-cold lysis buffer, immune complexes were desorbed from protein A-Sepharose beads by incubation with SDS sample buffer for 45 to 90 min at 37°C. Samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with equivalent amounts of receptors in each lane, determined as follows. The receptor expression for each cell line as assessed by flow cytometry was multiplied by the protein content of each immunoprecipitation tube. The resulting products were normalized and used to adjust the volumes of SDS sample buffer loaded onto the gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and dried before autoradiography using Biomax MR films (Kodak) and an intensifying screen at −80°C for 3 to 7 days. The same gels were subsequently analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager™. The extent of receptor phosphorylation in moles of phosphate per mol of receptor was determined essentially as described (15Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, 100-mm dishes of 293 cells transfected with pcDNA I-AT1A-R were incubated either for 48 h prior to stimulation in normal cell culture medium with 100 µCi [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine per ml, or for 6 h prior to stimulation in the same medium with 0.5 mCi/ml 32Pi. 32Pi-labeled cells were incubated for 3 min at 37°C with or without 200 nM angiotensin II. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of the AT1A-R were performed as described above. Following autoradiography, the AT1A-R bands were excised and liquid scintillation counting was performed as described (15Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The specific activity of 35S in total cellular proteins was calculated by solubilization of cells on a duplicate dish with 0.1 N NaOH (15Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Untransfected 293 cells were treated in parallel and were used to determine background activity in gel slices which corresponded to the AT1A-R. 293 cells expressing AT1A-R were plated in 100-mm dishes and were grown to 75% confluency. Okadaic acid (1 µM) was added 10 min prior to cellular stimulation. Cells were washed once with warm minimal essential medium and incubated for 3 min at 37°C with or without 400 nM angiotensin II in medium. After one rinse with 50 mM glycine, 150 mM NaCl, pH 3.0 for 30 s, cells were washed with PBS and scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA plus protease inhibitors as above). Cells were homogenized with 10 strokes of a Teflon pestle followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.4, at a protein concentration of 300 µg/ml. The angiotensin II-stimulated hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP in 15-µg aliquots of these membrane preparations was determined following a modification of the protocol originally developed by Cassel and Selinger (17Cassel D. Selinger Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 538-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) as described by Gierschik et al. (18Gierschik P. Bouillon T. Jakobs K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Reaction rates were linear for 15 min and were routinely stopped at 10 min. Experimental procedures were performed at least three times. Results were analyzed for statistical significance by an unpaired Student's t-test. Saturation isotherms were analyzed by computer-assisted curve-fitting (FigP for Windows 2.0, Biosoft). We first demonstrated that the AT1A-R in transiently transfected 293 cells undergoes rapid agonist-induced desensitization. Pretreatment for 3 min with 100 nM angiotensin II reduced the subsequent maximal angiotensin II-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis by 46% as compared to vehicle-pretreated control cells (Fig. 1, top panel). Attenuation of inositol phosphate generation was maximal when cells were pretreated with 10 to 30 nM angiotensin II and half-maximal effects were observed after pretreatment with approximately 2 nM angiotensin II (Fig. 1, Bottom Panel). By varying the time of pre-exposure to the agonist from 30 s to 12 min, we found that angiotensin II rapidly induced receptor desensitization with maximal effects observed by pretreatment for 1 min (data not shown). Agonist-induced internalization of the AT1A-R is a well established phenomenon (19Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31378-31382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, receptor internalization does not appear to account for the diminished inositol phosphate response in cells desensitized in these experiments. As determined by flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody (12CA5) which is specific for the amino-terminal epitope-tag of our AT1A-R construct, incubation of AT1A-R-expressing cells with 100 nM angiotensin II for 3 min resulted in the loss of only 15 ± 2% of plasma membrane receptors. In the range of receptor expression used in these experiments, such a small decrease in receptor number, modeled by transfecting cells with varied amounts of plasmid, has no effect on angiotensin II-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (data not shown). We then studied whether the AT1A-R is phosphorylated upon agonist stimulation. 293 Cells expressing the AT1A-R were equilibrated with 32Pi to label their ATP pool and were stimulated with increasing concentrations of agonist. In a dose-dependent fashion, angiotensin II induced within 5 min the phosphorylation of a 50-90-kDa band which was absent in untransfected 32Pi-labeled control cells (Fig. 2). This protein co-migrated with the photoaffinity-labeled AT1A-R from transfected 293 cell membranes. Phosphorylation of the AT1A-R was induced by as little as 0.1 nM angiotensin II and reached a maximum at 100 nM angiotensin II; the EC50 value was 4.5 nM. By labeling cells to equilibrium with 32Pi and [35S]methionine, the amount of phosphate incorporated in the AT1A-R was determined to be 1.0 ± 0.4 (mean ± S.D.) mol of phosphate per mol of receptor in cells stimulated with 200 nM angiotensin II. In unstimulated cells, the AT1A-R contained 0.2 ± 0.02 mol of phosphate per mol of receptor. To investigate which kinases effect AT1A-R phosphorylation, we challenged cells with both specific activators and inhibitors of the second messenger-dependent kinases, protein kinase C (PKC) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Whereas the phorbol ester PMA significantly increased AT1A-R phosphorylation above basal values, neither the PKA activators forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP, nor the calcium ionophore A23187, had an effect on receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3). The amount of 32P incorporated into the receptor upon stimulation of PKC was only 40% of that achieved by angiotensin II stimulation. Furthermore, staurosporine, which at this concentration (500 nM) blocks both PKA and PKC activity, inhibited the agonistinduced AT1A-R phosphorylation by only 42%. These results imply that both PKC, the kinase activated by signaling pathways downstream of the AT1A-R, and one or several protein kinases which are not affected by staurosporine, participate in the agonist-induced phosphorylation of this receptor. To test the hypothesis that agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation is effected by GRKs endogenously expressed in 293 cells, cells were co-transfected with a GRK2 dominant negative mutant (GRK2K220R). This mutant GRK retains the ability to bind the agonist-occupied receptor, but is devoid of catalytic activity and therefore acts as a competitive inhibitor of GRK activity. Overexpression of this mutant at an excess over endogenous GRKs has been found to inhibit GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation (13Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and desensitization (20Kong G. Penn R. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13084-13087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the overexpression of GRK2K220R reduced receptor phosphorylation consequent to angiotensin II stimulation for 5 min by 50%, as compared to control cells, but did not affect agonist-independent receptor phosphorylation through the PKC pathway. The combined inhibition of PKC by staurosporine and GRKs by GRK2K220R overexpression additively reduced agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation, resulting in an inhibition of receptor phosphorylation by 85% as compared to control cells. These findings imply that agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation is mediated by two different types of kinases: by one or more GRKs, which are directly activated by the agonist-occupied receptor, and by PKC, which is activated by second messengers generated consequent to receptor stimulation. Since both GRK and PKC activity appear important in agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation, we sought to characterize the kinetics of kinase activities. Previously, it had been demonstrated that GRK and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity on the β2-adrenergic receptor proceed by distinct kinetics (21Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3202-3209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Roth N.S. Campbell P.T. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6201-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The time course of angiotensin II-induced receptor phosphorylation revealed the existence of a biphasic process, characterized by a rapid (t1/2 ≈30 s) and a somewhat slower (t1/2 ≈3 min) time course (Fig. 5). Inhibition of PKC by staurosporine eliminated any agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation occurring after 3 min, but did not affect the rapid phase of AT1A-R phosphorylation. Conversely, PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation stimulated by PMA proceeded with a t1/2 of approximately 3 min. These observations support the notion that rapid agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation derives principally from GRK activity. Receptor phosphorylation seen with prolonged (over 3 min) agonist exposure, however, may derive significantly from PKC. If GRKs are involved in the agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation, overexpression of these kinases in 293 cells might be expected to enhance the angiotensin II-mediated receptor phosphorylation. Receptor immunoprecipitation from labeled 293 cells which overexpressed either GRK2, GRK3, or GRK5 revealed agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation which was 1.5-1.7-fold greater (p < 0.001) than that observed in control cells (Fig. 6). These experiments did not show significant differences between individual GRKs in their ability to enhance receptor phosphorylation in response to agonist. The increased basal phosphorylation of the AT1A-R seen in cells which overexpress GRK5, the kinase which is constitutively associated with the cellular membrane (12Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also observed in studies which investigated the role of GRKs in the phosphorylation of β1-adrenergic (13Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) or δ-opioid receptors (23Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). As shown by immunoblotting analysis, the transfection of 293 cells with pcDNA I constructs encoding GRK2, GRK3, or GRK5 resulted in cellular expression of these kinases at levels which were at least 20-fold higher than endogenous levels of GRK2 or GRK5. To assess the effect of GRK inhibition on agonist-induced receptor desensitization, we exposed 293 cells expressing the AT1A-R with or without GRK2K220R to angiotensin II for 3 min, removed the agonist with an acid wash, and prepared membranes for the determination of angiotensin II-stimulated GTPase activity (Fig. 7). Exposure of control cells to medium containing angiotensin II decreased agonist-stimulated membrane GTPase activity by 85% (mean of 3 experiments). In cells overexpressing GRK2, pretreatment with this agonist decreased angiotensin II-stimulated membrane GTPase activity by 91% (n = 4). In contrast, exposure of cells overexpressing GRK2K220R to angiotensin II failed to diminish angiotensin II-stimulated membrane GTPase activity at all. Thus, inhibition of GRK activity by GRK2K220R eliminates agonist-induced receptor desensitization assessed with maximal agonist stimulation. Assessed in intact cells, however, GRK2K220R appears to behave differently. In phosphoinositide hydrolysis experiments (data not shown), we observed that GRK2K220R overexpression decreased even maximal angiotensin II-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in intact cells by over 90%, just as wild type GRK2 did. Taken together with the GTPase findings, these data indicate that overexpressed GRKs may inhibit receptor signaling in intact cells not only by increasing receptor phosphorylation, but also by binding to the activated receptor and preventing receptor/G protein coupling. This latter function can also be served by GRK2K220R. The dampening effect of GRK2K220R on the process of signal generation is avoided by determining agonist-stimulated GTPase activity in washed membranes. The role of PKC-mediated AT1A-R phosphorylation in receptor desensitization was examined in intact cells which were pretreated with staurosporine prior to a desensitizing stimulus with angiotensin II (data not shown). To maximize potential effects of PKC, cells were treated as in Fig. 1, except that the prestimulation with angiotensin II was 12 min instead of 3 min. Pretreatment with 150 nM staurosporine for 10 min prior to this angiotensin II challenge had no effect on desensitization of agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis assessed with maximal agonist challenge. Concordant findings derive from 293 cells co-transfected with the AT1A-R and the endothelin B receptor. Stimulation of these cells with endothelin-1, which activates PKC, fails to diminish the subsequent phosphoinositide hydrolysis stimulated by a maximal challenge with angiotensin II. 2N. J. Freedman and R. J. Lefkowitz, unpublished observations. Many G protein-coupled receptors undergo regulatory processes which result in the diminution of their functions upon repeated or prolonged stimulation. Among several distinct mechanisms that have been implicated in the rapid desensitization of G protein-coupled receptor systems, covalent modification of agonist-bound receptors by phosphorylation appears to be particularly important. A current model of homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors proposes rapid, agonist-dependent translocation to the plasma membrane of a GRK, which binds and phosphorylates the agonist-occupied receptor (2Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The subsequent binding of an arrestin-like protein is believed to uncouple the activated receptor from its G protein. This paradigm was mainly established by utilizing purified proteins in vitro. The significance of GRK-mediated phosphorylation for the regulation of receptor function under intact cell conditions has been demonstrated only in few receptor systems, so far (13Freedman N.J.

In the present study, which focuses on the type 1A angiotensin II receptor, we inhibited endogenous cellular GRK activity by a dominant negative GRK2 mutant. Overexpression of this GRK2 mutant was found to inhibit significantly both the agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the AT1A-R. Furthermore, by overexpressing GRKs 2, 3, and 5, we show that each of these kinases augments agonist-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation. These findings imply an important role for GRKs in the regulation of the AT1A-R. In this study, we have concentrated on a possible role for GRKs and second messenger-dependent kinases in the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the AT1A-R. While we cannot exclude the possibility that other mechanisms participate in the desensitization of this receptor, several lines of evidence point to a central role for GRKs under the experimental conditions used in this study. Firstly, the concentration dependence of angiotensin II-induced desensitization (EC50≈2 nM ATII) paralleled ligand binding to the receptor. AT1A-R phosphorylation followed the same concentration dependence. The ability to phosphorylate G protein-coupled receptors only in their activated, agonist-bound states is a hallmark of GRKs. Secondly, maximal desensitization of the AT1A-R was observed after prestimulation of cells for only 1 min. This finding is consistent with the rapid kinetics of GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation (22Roth N.S. Campbell P.T. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6201-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), confirmed with the AT1A-R in this study. Thirdly, GRK inhibition by a GRK2 dominant negative mutant completely prevented AT1A-R desensitization as assessed by angiotensin II-stimulated membrane GTPase activity. In contrast, while PKC was also found to phosphorylate the AT1A-R after stimulation with angiotensin II, the functional consequences of PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation appear unimportant, at least when assessed at maximal levels of receptor stimulation. Recently, desensitization has been demonstrated with a truncated mutant of AT1A-R which lacks the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids, encompassing 13 serine/threonine residues (27Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although this result may seem difficult to reconcile with our own findings, the Ser and Thr residues important for AT1A-R desensitization have not yet been determined. Indeed, four serine and threonine residues in the first or second cytoplasmic loops, not affected by this deletion mutant, involve receptor regions critical for G protein coupling (28Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and may represent functionally important phosphorylation sites. The functional differentiation of PKC-mediated from GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation seems to relate to their differing time courses of action. In this regard, our findings are supported by the kinetic analysis of angiotensin II-induced translocation of PKC in vascular smooth muscle strips (29Haller H. Smallwood J.I. Rasmussen H. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The spatial translocation of the cytosolic kinase to the membrane, which is a prerequisite for PKC activation, was found to peak at 5 to 10 min and then gradually decline to background values. These data are in accord with the PKC-mediated AT1A-R phosphorylation, which we determined to proceed with a t1/2 of about 3 min. The different time course of GRK- versus PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation resembles the kinetics of GRK- and PKA-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (22Roth N.S. Campbell P.T. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6201-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this system, the GRKs rapidly induced receptor phosphorylation and desensitization with a t1/2 of about 15 s, whereas the second messenger-dependent enzyme PKA had a t1/2 of 2 to 3.5 min. Whereas several phospholipase C-coupled receptors have been shown to undergo negative feedback inhibition via PKC (30Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6044-6050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dunlay R. Hruska K. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F223-F231PubMed Google Scholar, 32Smit M.J. Bloemers S.M. Leurs R. Tertoolen L.G. Bast A. de Laat S.W. Timmerman H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), conflicting data have been reported in the past with regard to the AT1-R. PKC depletion or treatment with the selective PKC inhibitor Ro 31-7519 was shown not to affect the rapid agonist-induced desensitization in neonatal cardiac myocytes (33Abdellatif M.M. Neubauer C.F. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or in CHO cells expressing the human AT1-R (34Barker S. Kapas S. Fluck R.J. Clark A.J.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In our own experiments, PKC inhibition with staurosporine did not affect homologous desensitization of the AT1A-R. In contrast, Pfeilschifter and co-workers (35Ochsner M. Huwiler A. Fleck T. Pfeilschifter J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 245: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Pfeilschifter J.

Acta. 1988; 969: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have accumulated ample evidence implicating PKC in the angiotensin II-induced homologous desensitization in glomerular mesangial cells. In aggregate, these studies and ours suggest that the AT1A-R might be regulated by PKC in a cell type-specific manner. Using staurosporine as a PKC inhibitor and a dominant negative GRK2K220R mutant to prevent endogenous GRKs from interacting with the receptor, each type of kinase was shown to account for 40-50% of the receptor phosphorylation induced by agonist within 5 min. The virtually additive effect of the two kinase inhibitors identifies GRKs and PKC as the main, if not the only, kinases which cause short-term agonist-induced phosphorylation of the AT1A-R. The minimal residual receptor phosphorylation in the presence of both staurosporine and the dominant negative GRK2K220R mutant is probably due to incomplete efficacy of these inhibitors. Indeed, even when present in 15-fold molar excess, GRK2K220R was shown to inhibit only 60% of GRK2 activity on the β2-adrenergic receptor in the presence of G protein βγ subunits (20Kong G. Penn R. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13084-13087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the AT1A-R by PKA was reported in a previous study, which demonstrated phosphorylation of the receptor upon prolonged (15 min) stimulation with forskolin (8Kai H. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Ollerenshaw J.D. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This result is in contrast to our findings which, however, were obtained by incubation with forskolin for only 5 min. While we cannot definitely rule out a possible role for PKA in the regulation of the AT1A-R, this enzyme is not an effector kinase of the Gq-coupled AT1A-R and therefore would not be expected to be involved in agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation. In the same study, evidence was provided for both constitutive and agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the AT1A-R (8Kai H. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Ollerenshaw J.D. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino analysis of the receptor showed that stimulation with angiotensin II induces mainly serine phosphorylation, which supports our findings of GRK- and PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation was observed to a small extent and only after prolonged (≥20 min) stimulation with angiotensin II. In our own studies, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genestein had no effect on receptor phosphorylation or functional consequences of angiotensin II stimulation (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation therefore does not appear to contribute to the rapid agonist-induced desensitization of the AT1A-R. Our study is the first to propose a role for GRKs in the agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the AT1A-R. Each of the three tested GRK isoforms was shown to enhance receptor phosphorylation equally well. Nonetheless, depending on the varying tissue distributions and intracellular concentrations of GRKs, individual kinases may still fulfill highly specific roles in the regulation of the AT1A-R and other G protein-coupled receptors. We thank Sabrina T. Exum for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1995605077,"Rapid desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is mediated, at least in part, by their phosphorylation by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). However, only in the case of rhodopsin have the actual sites of receptor phosphorylation been unambiguously determined. Although previous studies have implicated the cytoplasmic tail of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) as the site of GRK-mediated phosphorylation, the identities of the phosphorylated residues were unknown. Here we report the identification of the sites of GRK2- and GRK5-mediated β2AR phosphorylation. The phosphorylation sites of both serine/threonine kinases reside exclusively in a 40-amino acid peptide located at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the β2AR. Of the seven phosphorylatable residues within this peptide, six are phosphorylated by GRK5 (Thr-384, Thr-393, Ser-396, Ser-401, Ser-407, and Ser-411) and four are phosphorylated by GRK2 (Thr-384, Ser-396, Ser-401, and Ser-407) at equivalent phosphorylation stoichiometries (~1.0 mol Pi/mol receptor). In addition to the GRK5-specific phosphorylation of Thr-393 and Ser-411, differences in the distribution of phosphate between sites are observed for GRK2 and GRK5. Increasing the stoichiometry of GRK2-mediated β2AR phosphorylation from ~1.0 to 5.0 mol Pi/mol receptor increases the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of Thr-384, Ser-396, Ser-401, and Ser-407 rather than increasing the number of phosphoacceptor sites. The location of multiple GRK2 and GRK5 phosphoacceptor sites at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the β2AR is highly reminiscent of GRK1-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin. Rapid desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is mediated, at least in part, by their phosphorylation by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). However, only in the case of rhodopsin have the actual sites of receptor phosphorylation been unambiguously determined. Although previous studies have implicated the cytoplasmic tail of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) as the site of GRK-mediated phosphorylation, the identities of the phosphorylated residues were unknown. Here we report the identification of the sites of GRK2- and GRK5-mediated β2AR phosphorylation. The phosphorylation sites of both serine/threonine kinases reside exclusively in a 40-amino acid peptide located at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the β2AR. Of the seven phosphorylatable residues within this peptide, six are phosphorylated by GRK5 (Thr-384, Thr-393, Ser-396, Ser-401, Ser-407, and Ser-411) and four are phosphorylated by GRK2 (Thr-384, Ser-396, Ser-401, and Ser-407) at equivalent phosphorylation stoichiometries (~1.0 mol Pi/mol receptor).

https://openalex.org/W2048065251,"Introduction of the β1-4 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-III) gene was reported to suppress metastasis in highly metastatic B16-hm murine melanoma cells (Yoshimura, M., Nishikawa, A., Ihara, Y., Taniguchi, S., and Taniguchi, N. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 8754-8758). In this study, the effect of GnT-III gene transfer on E-cadherin was studied, since E-cadherin acts as a suppressor of metastasis. E-cadherin expression at cell-cell contacts of B16-hm cells expressing high GnT-III activity was greater than controls without affecting transcription. Lectin blotting showed that E-cadherin from GnT-III transfectants was glycosylated by ectopically expressed GnT-III. The glycosylated E-cadherin exhibited the delayed turnover and the decreased release from cell surface, as compared with the native E-cadherin, resulting in the elevated expression at the cell-cell border of GnT-III transfectants. Furthermore, cell-cell aggregation was enhanced in GnT-III transfectants, indicating that the glycosylated E-cadherin is biologically functional. These results suggest that the glycosylated E-cadherin contributes to the suppression of metastasis by the introduction of GnT-III gene into melanoma cells. Introduction of the β1-4 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-III) gene was reported to suppress metastasis in highly metastatic B16-hm murine melanoma cells (Yoshimura, M., Nishikawa, A., Ihara, Y., Taniguchi, S., and Taniguchi, N.

The malignant phenotype, including metastatic potential, has been reported to be associated with the β1-6 branches of N-oligosaccharides, the product of β1-6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-V, EC) 1The abbreviations used are: GnT-Vβ1-6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferaseGnT-IIIβ1-4 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferaseE-PHAerythroagglutinating phytohemagglutininDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineTBSTris-HCl-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. in ras-transformed rat fibroblasts, rat mammary carcinoma cells, rat lymphoma cell line (1Yousefi S.

The composition of β1-6 branches is also reported to correlate with the progression and staging of human breast and colon neoplasia (4Fernandes B. Sagman U. Auger M. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 718-723PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopical expression of GnT-V gene in mouse lung epithelial cell line resulted in loss of contact inhibition, progressive growth of tumors, and increase of lung metastasis after subcutaneous inoculation into nude mice (5Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhar S. Dennis J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This report also supports that the β1-6 structure plays a causative role in tumorigenicity and metastasis. β1-6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase β1-4 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline Tris-HCl-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1, both β1-4 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-III, EC) and GnT-V use the biantennary structure of N-oligosaccharides as a substrate, and substrate specificity studies showed that GnT-V is not able to form any further triantennary structure in the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc residue (6Schachter H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 7Fujii S. Nishiura A. Nishikawa A. Miura R. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6009-6018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance data (8Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the biantennary structure of a core mannose was twisted in the presence of bisecting GlcNAc. This conformational change rendered the substrate inaccessible to GnT-V to form the β1-6 structure, which raised the possibility that β1-6 branch formation could be suppressed by the introduction of the GnT-III gene, thereby resulting in changes in the metastatic potential and of malignant phenotypes. Actually, in our investigation, the decrease of β1-6 structure by the competition between the endogeneous GnT-V and ectopically expressed GnT-III led to the suppression of lung metastasis by mouse melanoma cells (9Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The metastatic process is a complex of many biological events, and many molecules are responsible for metastasis (10Hart I.R. Saini A. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1453-1457Abstract PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As almost all of these molecules are glycoproteins, the alteration of enzyme activity, which catalyzes the formation of the sugar chain such as the introduction of the GnT-V gene (5Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhar S. Dennis J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) or the GnT-III gene (9Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), may change the structure and composition of N-glycans and may affect the physiological function of the molecules responsible for metastasis. The present investigation was undertaken to examine whether the reduced metastatic potential of B16 murine melanoma cells expressing ectopic GnT-III was due to the altered biological function of E-cadherin that mediates homotypic cell-cell adhesion, since the E-cadherin expression correlates inversely to metastatic phenotype in many cancer cells (11Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 12Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M.

A. 1994; 91: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We found that the E-cadherin, which was glycosylated by GnT-III, was increased due to the prolonged turnover rate and the decreased release from cell surface. Furthermore, cell aggregation was increased in GnT-III transfectants, indicating that the glycosylated E-cadherin participates in the suppression of metastasis by GnT-III gene transfer. Biotinylated erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA) was obtained from Honen Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Rat anti-mouse E-cadherin monoclonal antibody (ECCD-2) (12Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) was purchased from Takara Co. Ltd. (Shiga, Japan). Biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG was from Vector (Burlingame, CA), and goat anti-rat IgG and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG was from Becton Dickinson. B16-hm displaying highly metastatic potential, GnT-III-transfected B16-hm cells displaying low metastatic potential, and mock-transfected B16-hm cells, which had been already established (9Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), were used in this investigation. They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells in exponential growth and between 4 and 10 passages were used throughout this investigation, and the results described here were independent of passage number. B16-hm cells and GnT-III transfectants were seeded on 3.5-cm dishes with a coverglass on the bottom of the dish. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with Tris-HCl-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (TBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. After the nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS, cells were incubated with ECCD-2 (10 µg/ml) in TBS containing 5 mM CaCl2 for 4 h at 4°C and then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (10 µg/ml) for 1 h at 4°C. The fluorescence of the cells was visualized with a photomicroscope with epifluorescence (IIRS, Olympus, Japan) and photographed with a 20-s exposure. Cells were also observed and photographed with a microscope camera (ELWD 0.3, Nikon, Japan). Cells were pelleted and lysed in the lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) containing 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mM CaCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml aprotinin for 20 min on ice. Following clarification at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, the protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (200 µg of protein) were precleared with normal rabbit serum (Vector) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and then incubated with ECCD-2 (10 µg/ml). Immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose beads and were released by boiling in Laemmli's sampling buffer, separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Germany). The blots were blocked in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 containing 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 4 h with biotinylated E-PHA (10 µg/ml) or probed with ECCD-2 (10 µg/ml) followed by biotinylated anti-IgG (10 µg/ml). After washing three times with TBS with 0.05% Tween 20, the blots were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-avidin complex (Vector) and developed using an ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. In using ECCD-2, the probing of the Western blot was performed in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2, because Ca2+ was necessary for this antibody to recognize the epitope (12Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Signals by E-PHA binding and ECCD-2 binding were judged by densitometric scanning (Shimazu, CS-9000, Tokyo, Japan) and standardized as to the amount of E-cadherin. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell samples by acid guanidine thiocyanate and phenol/chloroform extraction (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63166) Google Scholar). Extracted RNAs (20 µg) were electrophoresed on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel, which was stained with ethidium bromide to confirm the amount of RNA loaded, and RNAs were transferred onto a Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). After hybridization of the membrane with a 32P-labeled mouse E-cadherin full-length cDNA (12Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) (donated by Dr. Takeichi, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) overnight, the membrane was washed and autoradiographed, as described (12Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Subconfluent monolayers of B16-hm cells and GnT-III transfectants in 6-well tissue cultures were preincubated for 2 h at 37°C with methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with dialyzed 10% fetal calf serum. For pulse-chase studies, L-[35S]methionine and L-[35S]cysteine (Pro-mix™, Amersham Corp.) were added at the concentration of 50 µCi/ml to the culture media and incubated for 15 min at 37°C for protein labeling. After rinsing five times with cold PBS to remove excess [35S]methionine/cysteine, cells were incubated at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h in DMEM with 10% non-dialyzed fetal calf serum. At the various incubation times, supernatant was collected from each well before the well was washed five times with PBS. Then, E-cadherin molecules, which were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and supernatants, were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE in the same procedure as described above. After electrophoresis, the gel was completely dried using a Gel Dryer (Bio-Rad, model 583) and autoradiographed for 2 days using x-ray film. The effect of ECCD-2 on the cell aggregation assay was evaluated, as described (15Jiang W.G. Hiscox S. Hallett M.B. Horrobin D.F. Mansel R.E. Puntis M.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5043-5048PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, B16-hm cells or GnT-III transfectants were washed once with PBS and incubated in the assay buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.6 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 0.01% trypsin and 2 mM CaCl2 for 30 min at 37°C. Then, cells (3 × 104 cells) were washed twice with assay buffer, resuspended in 300 µl of assay buffer containing 2 mM CaCl2, and transferred into each well of 24-well plates (Costar). An antibody to rat IgG as a control or the ECCD-2 was added to each well at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 µg/ml in triplicate. After a 60-min incubation with occasional shaking at 37°C, an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde in PBS was added to each well, and the plates were centrifuged for fixation. Photos were taken at random under a phase contrast microscope (Nikon) to count single cells or cell aggregates (10 or more cells). After counting cells (>200), cell aggregation was determined by Rcont− Re, where Rcont and Re are the ratio of cells in aggregate per total cell count in the presence of anti-rat IgG and ECCD-2, respectively. Cell aggregation assay was repeated three times. The Rcont values were always above 0.90 and were not significantly different at any concentration of the antibody. Two clones with elevated GnT-III activity designated as B16-hm-III-1 and −2, and one clone with no detectable GnT-III activity designated as B16-hm-neo-1 were used in this investigation as positive transfectants and a control transfectant, respectively. Morphologically, the B16-hm cells and the control transfectant appeared fibroblastoid with loose cell-cell contacts, whereas positive transfectants were epithelioid and proliferated in compact organization (Fig. 2A). E-cadherin expression was examined by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B). In B16-hm cells and a control transfectant, E-cadherin was weakly expressed at the cell-cell contacts. Positive transfectants, however, showed intense fluorescence with condensation at the cell-cell contacts, indicating elevated expression of E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts of positive transfectants. E-PHA lectin was used to analyze the alterations of carbohydrate structures of E-cadherin, since E-PHA has a high affinity for bisecting GlcNAc structure (16Yamashita K. Hitoi K. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 258: 14753-14755Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Western blotting studies showed that the expression of E-cadherin was more increased in positive transfectants than in B16-hm cells and control transfectants (Fig. 3A, upper panel), which was consistent with the results of immunofluorescence microscopy. The signal for E-PHA binding to the positive cells was detected as the bands at 125 kDa, corresponding to immunoprecipitated E-cadherin, while these bands were almost undetectable in the B16-hm cells and a control transfectant (Fig. 3A, lower panel). The relative E-PHA binding ratio (%) normalized by E-cadherin signal density was as follows: B16-hm, 0.9; B16-hm-neo-1, 1.5; B16-hm-III-1, 13.4; and B16-hm-III-2, 16.9; this indicated that the E-cadherin in the positive transfectants was glycosylated by GnT-III and few, if any, bisected oligosaccharides were attached to E-cadherin in B16-hm cells and a control transfectant. As compared with the B16-hm cells and the control transfectant, E-cadherin transcripts were not increased in positive transfectants, suggesting that the raised E-cadherin expression in GnT-III transfectants was not due to an increase of the transcriptional level (Fig. 3B). The turnover rate of E-cadherin was examined by chase studies. In B16-hm cells, immunoprecipitated surface E-cadherin showed the most intense signal at 4 h and then declined to an undetectable level at 12 h (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Immunoprecipitated surface E-cadherin from B16-hm-III-1 cells (upper panel) showed the most intensified signal at 8 h, and the signals of the immunoprecipitated E-cadherin were maintained at the detectable level during all the chase time periods. Released E-cadherin was detected as a band of 104 kDa in the supernatants from both B16-hm cells and positive transfectants, which was less in size than the surface E-cadherin (Fig. 4B). In the supernatant of B16-hm cells, released E-cadherin was first detected at 2 h, gradually increased to show the most intensified signal at 8 h, and maintained to be at the detectable level during the incubation (upper panel). In B16-hm-III-1 cells, released E-cadherin was undetectable until 4 h during the incubation. The signals of released E-cadherin at 4 and 8 h were faint and much weaker than that detected in the supernatants of B16-hm cells and declined to the undetectable level at 12 and 24 h (lower panel). Turnover and release of E-cadherin of a control transfectant were similar to that of B16-hm cells, showing that transfection procedures did not affect the turnover of E-cadherin (data not shown). Collectively with these results, expression of GnT-III prolonged the turnover of E-cadherin and inhibited the release of E-cadherin from cell surface, which resulted in an increased level and accumulation of E-cadherin molecules at cell-cell contacts. To determine whether the increased E-cadherin expression was involved in the homotypic cell adhesion of B16-hm cells, cell aggregation was assayed using an antibody to E-cadherin that blocks E-cadherin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 5). In B16-hm cells and a control transfectant, more than 90% of cell aggregation was inhibited by 5 µg/ml ECCD-2. The inhibitory effect by ECCD-2 was, however, considerably lower in the positive transfectants, showing that the increased E-cadherin expression was associated with increased cell aggregation and that raised E-cadherin was biologically functional. In many glycoproteins, the composition of oligosaccharides, especially N-linked oligosaccharides, exists in the structural components, which contribute to the folding, stability, and biological function of the molecules (17Dwek R.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1234-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Taniguchi N. Ihara Y. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Wyss D.F. Choi J.S.

Therefore, the activity and stability of the glycoprotein could be affected by subtle changes in oligosaccharide components. For example, an N-oligosaccharide on CD2 stabilizes the protein structure for the interaction with CD58 (19Wyss D.F. Choi J.S. Li J. Knoppers M.H. Willis K.J. Arulanandam A.R.N. Smolyar A. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. Science. 1995; 269: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Replication of the hepatitis B virus is suppressed by GnT-III gene transfer (20Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Hayashi N. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28311-28315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Non-glycosylated growth hormone, which is secreted both from the apical and basolateral sides of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, is secreted from the apical side when glycosylated (21Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the altered biological function of N-glycosylated E-cadherin by means of the introduction of the GnT-III gene (22Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into mouse melanoma B16-hm cells. As the exogeneous expression of GnT-III affects the processing of glycoproteins with complex-type oligosaccharides, the GnT-III gene transfection gives a global effect on many glycoproteins, including E-cadherin. Deduced from the amino acid sequence, mouse E-cadherin has four putative N-glycosylation sites (12Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Lectin blot analysis revealed that immunoprecipitated E-cadherin from both B16-hm cells and a control transfectant had undetectable bisecting GlcNAc residues. In contrast, E-cadherin from the positive transfectant did bind E-PHA, indicating bisecting GlcNAc residues were added to E-cadherin molecules through the glycosylation by GnT-III in the positive transfectants. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of E-cadherin on the cell surface was elevated in the positive transfectants, whereas Northern analysis showed that the expression level of E-cadherin transcripts in positive transfectants was not significantly increased in comparison with that of B16-hm cells and a control transfectant, suggesting that ectopically expressed GnT-III may have a significant influence to E-cadherin not at the transcription level but at the post-translational level. Next, we quantitated the turnover of E-cadherin by means of pulse-chase studies. Positive transfectants showed the delayed turnover of E-cadherin and the elevated E-cadherin amount on the cell surface, as determined by a pulse-chase study. Moreover, release of E-cadherin from the cell surface was decreased in positive transfectants, suggesting that the increased bisecting GlcNAc structure is likely to be suppressive to the proteolytic cleavage of E-cadherin on the cell surface. The prolonged turnover and inhibited release led to the elevation and accumulation of E-cadherin at cell-cell contact regions. As the expression level of E-cadherin on the cell surface has been reported to inversely correlate with cell invasion and metastatic potential (11Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), homotypic adhesion is likely to be enhanced in the positive transfectants, which lead to the suppression of metastasis. As the introduction of N-glycosylation sites is shown to modify protein sorting (19Wyss D.F. Choi J.S. Li J. Knoppers M.H. Willis K.J. Arulanandam A.R.N. Smolyar A. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. Science. 1995; 269: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the turnover of E-cadherin also may be affected by the aberrant glycosylation by GnT-III. To examine further whether the increased E-cadherin at the cell-cell border of positive transfectants was biologically functional as a homotypic adhesion molecule, we performed cell aggregation assay and evaluated adhesive function of glycosylated E-cadherin. Compared with B16-hm cells and control transfectants, cell-cell binding was more enhanced in positive transfectants, as judged by cell aggregation assay. Thus, this indicates that cell-cell aggregation was quantitatively enhanced by the increased expression of E-cadherin, although there also remains a possibility that the glycosylation may give the qualitative effect on the adhesive function of E-cadherin. We conclude that the suppression of metastasis in B16-hm cells expressing GnT-III (9Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) is at least partly due to the increased level of glycosylated E-cadherin. Taken together, the results in this study indicate that the introduction of GnT-III gene raised the surface expression of glycosylated E-cadherin due to the delay of its turnover rate and the inhibition of its release from cell surface to result in the enhanced cell aggregation in GnT-III transfectants. These findings are supposed to lead to the suppression of metastasis in mice, as previously reported (9Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We believe that our study is the first demonstration that aberrant glycosylation of an adhesion molecule through transferred gene for a glycosyltransferase could modify cell adhesion to suppress metastasis. This indicates that glycosylation is one of the important events in the process of metastasis. We thank Dr. M. Takeichi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) for kindly providing mouse E-cadherin cDNA and valuable suggestions."

The cleavage and activation of the native p45 ICE precursor have been characterized by use of specific inhibitors and antibodies recognizing various regions of ICE. The processing of p45 in vitro in THP.1 monocytic cell cytoplasmic extracts is inhibited only by protease inhibitors that inhibit ICE and not by inhibitors of other protease classes. The addition of L-742,395, a biotinylated irreversible ICE inhibitor, to these extracts labels only p45 and simultaneously inhibits p45 processing, demonstrating that the p45 has catalytic activity. Following a cleavage of p45 at a site that becomes the COOH terminus of p20, a more active intermediate is formed which migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an molecular mass of 35 kDa (ED50 of ~0.1 µM L-742,395 labeling versus 5 µM for p45). This new more active ICE form serves both as an intermediate enzyme to cleave p45 as well as a substrate for the formation of the final active ICE (ED50 of 1 nM L-742,395 labeling of p20 and for p22, an NH2-terminally extended form of p20). While initial cleavage of p45 can be found at the sites corresponding to both the NH2 termini of p22 and p20, these fragments cannot be labeled by L-742,395 and are hence inactive. p45 is not processed at the site corresponding to the NH2 terminus of the p10. Less than 50% of the p45 is cleaved down to active p20 or p22 ICE as determined by band shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the biotinylated fragments, indicating that the in vitro activation is highly inefficient. The ICE fragmentation occurs by an intermolecular process and is highly dilution sensitive. Cleavage of p45 by exogenous p20/p10 ICE differs from that of the endogenous p45 cleavage activity in that the p20/p10 activity is more salt sensitive, and it produces a different pattern of cleavage fragments, principally 35- and 12-kDa fragments. These results indicate that the nature of the ICE activity changes as p45 is processed down to the p20/p10 form of the enzyme.

Active ICE consists of two polypeptides of 20 and 10 kDa (p20 and p10) associated in a 1:1 ratio, which are processed from an inactive cytoplasmic 45-kDa precursor (p45, see Fig. 1) (7Thornberry N.A.

Likewise, the ICE homologs contain two comparable subunits derived from a common precursor (16Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3741) Google Scholar, 18Fernandes-Alnemri T. Takahashi A.

The activation of the p45 ICE precursor protein, which results in the loss of the precursor domain, may be important not only for ICE, but also for the other homologs. ICErelII and ICErelIII, for example, show no proapoptotic activity until the prodomain is removed (15Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15870-15876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Hence an understanding of the activation of ICE may be relevant for the activation of other homologs. In the present report we trace the activation of p45 ICE through a sequential series of ICE-dependent proteolytic activation steps to generate fragments of increased catalytic activity ultimately producing p20/p10 ICE. We use a biotinylated irreversible ICE inhibitor, L-742,395, and analogs to characterize the relative activity of the ICE fragments at each cleavage step. The relative concentration of L-742,395 required to label these ICE fragments is a function of the activity of that fragment, the binding, turnover, and simultaneous covalent labeling of the ICE forms with biotin. Using this technique, we show that the p45 found in monocytic cells is weakly active on ICE peptide substrates, requiring micromolar concentrations of inhibitor for labeling and inhibition of processing. Following a cleavage at the COOH terminus of p20 (Asp297-Ser, Fig. 1), the resultant 35-kDa/p12 fragment is 100-fold more active than p45 and is responsible for cleavage of ICE down to the p20/p10 form. The p20/p10 ICE form has the highest affinity to L-742,395, showing the same <1 nM ED50 for covalent labeling as was shown previously for inhibition of substrate cleavage (23Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Zhao J.J. Howard A.D. Griffin P.R. Chapman K.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The ICE activity that cleaves p45 down to the highly active p20/p10 form is catalytically different from p20/p10: it does not cleave pIL-1β, the activity is less sensitive to salt inhibition and is more sensitive to dilution, and its inhibition requires higher concentrations of ICE inhibitors than does p20/p10 ICE. THP.1 cells were grown in suspension in roller bottles in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) to a density of ~1.5 × 106 cells/ml, subcultured weekly. Cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (24Miller D.K. Ayala J.M. Egger L.A. Raju S.M. Yamin T.-T. Ding G.J.-F. Gaffney E.P. Howard A.D. Palyha O.C. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P.

Briefly, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, swollen in hypotonic buffer (containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EGTA), and broken with a Dounce homogenizer in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, and leupeptin. Nuclei were removed, 6 mM EDTA was added to the postnuclear supernatant, and granules and microsomal membranes were subsequently removed by sequential centrifugation. The supernatants were stored at −80°C following addition of 2 mM dithiothreitol. DEAE-HPLC fractionation of cytosolic extracts were performed as described previously (24Miller D.K. Ayala J.M.

Molineaux S.M. Mumford R.A. Calaycay J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18062-18069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ICE activity was measured by either the cleavage of the protein substrates [35S]Met pIL-1β or p45 ICE or the fluorescent peptide substrate AcYVAD-AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) as described previously (24Miller D.K. Ayala J.M. Egger L.A. Raju S.M. Yamin T.-T. Ding G.J.-F. Gaffney E.P. Howard A.D. Palyha O.C. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Thornberry N.A. Weidner J.R. Williams J.H. Chapman K.T. Jackson J. Kostura M.J.

Protein substrate assays were typically done in a 20-µl volume using 5-10 µl of cytosolic extract and 0.5 µl of [35S]Met substrate in a buffer of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 2 mM dithiothreitol (HSCD buffer). Incubations were performed at 30°C for 60 min. The products of the [35S]Met reaction were separated by SDS-PAGE on 16% gels (Novex, San Diego, CA), and the gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA), dried, and exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1-3 days. Occasionally the gels were soaked for 30 min in Amplify fluorographic enhancer (Amersham Corp.), and dried directly for autoradiography. For measurement of AcYVAD-AMC activity, 100-µl samples containing 20 µM substrate in HSCD buffer were incubated 60 min, 30°C, fractionated by C18-HPLC and compared to known AMC standards (see Ref. 25Thornberry N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Units of activity were calculated where 1 unit equals 1 pmol of AMC released per min at 25°C at saturating substrate (Km = 14 µM). The indicated antibodies (in parentheses) were prepared as described previously (22Ayala J.M. Yamin T.T. Egger L.A. Chin J. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. J.

In addition, antibodies were generated to active p20/p10 (goat G273, rabbit R105, rabbit JD2, and rabbit JD3) or to purified recombinant p10 (rabbit R49 and rabbit JD5). The irreversible ICE inhibitor L-742,395 (Ac-Tyr-Val-Lys(biotin)-Asp-(acyloxy)-methyl-ketone), its nonbiotinylated analog L-702,066, and the reversible inhibitor L-709,049 (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO) were prepared at Merck. Biotinylation was performed by the addition of dilutions of L-742,395 to ICE-containing samples for at least 10 min at 25°C (conditions commensurate the inactivation of >99.99% of active ICE by this irreversible inhibitor, see Ref. 23Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Zhao J.J. Howard A.D. Griffin P.R. Chapman K.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of ICE-containing extracts was performed as described previously (22Ayala J.M. Yamin T.T. Egger L.A. Chin J. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2592-2599PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for immunoprecipitation of “native” samples, 1 volume of 2 × RIPA buffer (1 × includes 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) was added to the sample followed by 1 µl of antiserum/500 µl. For immunoprecipitation of denatured samples, the sample was heated with 1% SDS (diluted from a 20 × stock) for 3 min, 100°C, cooled, and then mixed with 4 volumes of SDS-free RIPA prior to the addition of the indicated antiserum. Protease inhibitors as well as 10 mM iodoacetic acid were added to all samples prior to incubation with the antisera. Following incubation with the antibody at 5°C overnight, the complexed antibodies were collected with washed protein A-agarose that had been preblocked for 60 min with Superblock (Pierce). After heating with 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, aliquots were electrophoresed on 16% gels as described above and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For immunoblotting, the membranes were dried and blocked with Superblock for 60 min at room temperature. For ICE protein detection, the blots were incubated for 60 min with a 1:5000 dilution of the primary antibody, followed by 60 min with a 1:5000 dilution of either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (both from Amersham). Bands were detected by addition of luminol reagents (ECL, Amersham) and exposure of Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham) for 10 s to 5 min. For detection of biotinylated ICE proteins, the blocked membranes were incubated for 25 min with a 1:1000 dilution of avidin followed by 25 min with a 1:500 dilution of biotinylated anti-avidin (both from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated strepavidin (Amersham). To quantitate the intensity of the bands produced by luminometry or autoradiography, the films were scanned with a Quantity One densitometry system (PDI, Huntington Station, NY). Previously we have shown that p45 is the major form of ICE seen in monocytic cell extracts (22Ayala J.M. Yamin T.T. Egger L.A. Chin J. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2592-2599PubMed Google Scholar). The p45 band could be resolved into a mixture of two closely migrating bands with a densitometric ratio of 3:1 of the slower to more rapidly eluting band (denoted by heavy and light lines, respectively, Fig. 2A) of which the top band comigrated with p45 expressed in transfected COS cells. To observe the processing of p45, THP.1 cytoplasmic extracts were incubated at 30°C for several hours, and the ICE fragments generated were characterized by immunoblot. After a 0.5-h lag, the p45 bands were rapidly cleaved to three groups of bands: (i) a series of closely spaced bands with a major band migrating at 35 kDa, (ii) p22 and p20, and (iii) p10 (Fig. 2A). During in vitro cleavage, the 35-kDa proteins were formed first, with maximum production during the most rapid phase of the p45 proteolysis and then a gradual disappearance as the p45 was totally broken down (Fig. 2B). The p20 and p22 were formed later in roughly equal amounts, and they were stable for several hours. This suggests that the 35-kDa bands are intermediates in the formation of p22 and p20. p10 was formed with the same time scale as p20 and p22, but its intensity relative to p20 was very low with a relative absorbance of less than 10% that of p20. In contrast, active ICE purified by a peptide inhibitor affinity column contained p20 and p10 with a relative absorbance of 1:0.3 (p20:p10; Fig. 2A). This suggests that a preferential degradation and loss of p10 versus p20 and p22 occurred during the incubation (Fig. 2, A and B). The amount of pIL-1β cleavage activity observed in the incubated cytoplasmic extracts increased in parallel with the breakdown of the p45, which itself showed no pIL-1β cleavage activity. ICE activity reached a maximum after about 60 min of incubation (Fig. 2C), at a time when the rate of generation of the 35-kDa intermediates and p22/p20/p10 was maximal. The pIL-1β cleavage activity decreased at later times despite the lack of obvious changes in the p22/p20/p10 ICE present (Fig. 2, A and B). This loss of activity reflects the instability of active ICE, which had previously been observed in cytoplasmic extracts (24Miller D.K. Ayala J.M. Egger L.A. Raju S.M. Yamin T.-T. Ding G.J.-F. Gaffney E.P. Howard A.D. Palyha O.C. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Thornberry N.A. Weidner J.R. Williams J.H. Chapman K.T. Jackson J. Kostura M.J. Limjuco G. Molineaux S.M. Mumford R.A. Calaycay J.R. J.

In contrast, addition of such protease inhibitors as leupeptin, pepstatin, elastatinal, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, E64, tetrathionate, benzamidine, chymostatin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, α1-protease inhibitor, orthophenanthroline, or EDTA had no effect on p45 cleavage (data not shown). This profile is consistent with cleavage by ICE or a closely related cysteine protease. The cleavage of p45 was unlikely due to the action of other ICE homologs, however. Comparison of the inhibition of p45 activation by an inhibitor of the ICE homolog apopain, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (see Refs. 16Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K.

This relative difference in potency closely mirrored the corresponding inhibition of p20/p10 ICE by Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO relative to L-709,049. 2N. A. Thornberry, personal communication. The detailed inhibitory effects on p45 cleavage were determined with the addition of the ICE inhibitor L-742,395, Ac-Tyr-Val-Lys(biotin)-Asp-(acyloxy)-methyl-ketone. This irreversible ICE inhibitor both inhibited p20/p10 ICE activity and irreversibly biotinylated the p20 active site Cys with an ED50 of <1 nM (23Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Zhao J.J. Howard A.D. Griffin P.R. Chapman K.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Addition of L-742,395 to THP.1 cytosol inhibited the proteolysis of p45 in a complex, dose-dependent fashion. Addition of 2-1000 nM L-742,395 gave a dose-dependent inhibition of the majority of p45 cleavage (Fig. 3A). There was an additional background component of the p45 cleavage that 1000 nM L-742,395 did not inhibit (Fig. 3A). This cleavage could, however, be inhibited for several hours by addition of high (>10 µM) L-742,395 concentrations (Fig. 3A). Thus, it appeared that there were two activities that could cleave p45: the first was sensitive to ~10-100 nM L-742,395, whereas the second required micromolar concentrations of L-742,395 for inhibition. The first of these activities was principally responsible for the formation of the p22, p20, and p10: 200 nM L-742,395 inhibited the formation of all three proteins (Fig. 3B). When these L-742,395-inhibited extracts were tested for pIL-1β cleavage activity, the concentration of L-742,395 required to inhibit pIL-1β processing was 1 nM (Fig. 3C), indicating that neither of the activities cleaving p45 cleaved pIL-1β. By 60 min at a concentration of 1 nM, there was less than 10% inhibition of p45 breakdown and formation of p20/p22 (Fig. 3C). Hence pIL-1β cleavage is much more sensitive to L-742,395 than p45 processing. The observation that at 1 nM L-742,395 only the p20 and p22 polypeptides are labeled provides further evidence that only the p20/p10 or p22/p10 forms have the ability to cleave pIL-1β (see below). Since the L-742,395 is an irreversible inhibitor, newly generated active forms of ICE are immediately inhibited and accumulate during incubation with L-742,395. The biotinylated forms can then be detected by immunoblots using a biotin detection system and compared with the amount of each protein as detected by immunoblots with an anti-ICE antibody. When this analysis was applied to the incubates described in Fig. 3, A and B, it was apparent that at very low (2 nM) L-742,395 concentrations only two bands were specifically biotinylated, corresponding to biotinylated p20 and p22 (Fig. 3D). The amounts of the biotinylated p20 and p22 forms as determined by both biotin labeling (Fig. 3D, right) and protein labeling (Fig. 3D, left) were highest in the 7-200 nM range of L-742,395, corresponding to those L-742,395 concentrations that permitted maximal p22 and p20 formation (Fig. 3B). At the highest L-742,395 concentrations where little p22 and p20 was formed (Fig. 3D, left), two higher molecular mass 35-kDa bands accumulated (Fig. 3D, left, arrowheads) that were biotinylated (Fig. 3D, right). These 35-kDa proteins represented biotinylated versions of the two unlabeled 35-kDa bands observed in the absence of inhibitor (Fig. 3D, left, heavy and light solid lines; cf. Fig. 2A). The appearance of these biotinylated 35-kDa intermediates occurred in an L-742,395 dose-dependent fashion inversely with the disappearance of the unbiotinylated forms (Fig. 3D). Most importantly, at the highest concentrations, 1000 and 200 nM, the 35-kDa biotinylated forms accumulated steadily over the several hour incubation of the experiment (not shown). These were the only biotinylated forms that accumulated with the 200-1000 nM L-742,395 concentrations under which the formation of p20 and p22 (Fig. 3B) was inhibited. This suggests that these forms compris"

T. (1994) <i>Methods Enzymol.</i> 238, 116-127). The full-length cDNA sequence obtained from mouse brain predicts a 1353-amino acid protein possessing a 12-membrane span topology, and containing two regions of high similarity with the catalytic domains of adenylyl cyclases. Comparison of this novel adenylyl cyclase with the eight previously described mammalian enzymes indicates that this type 9 adenylyl cyclase sequence is the most divergent, defining a sixth distinct subclass of mammalian adenylyl cyclases. The AC9 gene has been localized to human chromosome band 16p13.3-13.2. The 8.5-kb mRNA encoding the type 9 adenylyl cyclase is widely distributed, being readily detected in all tissues tested, and is found at very high levels in skeletal muscle and brain. AC9 mRNA is found throughout rat brain but is particularly abundant in hippocampus, cerebellum, and neocortex. An antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminus of the type 9 adenylyl cyclase detects native and expressed recombinant AC9 protein in tissue and cell membranes. Levels of the AC9 protein are highest in mouse brain membranes. Characterization of expressed recombinant AC9 reveals that the protein is a functional adenylyl cyclase that is stimulated by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, forskolin, and mutationally activated G<sub>s</sub>α. AC9 activity is not affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin or by G protein βγ-subunits. Thus AC9 represents a functional G protein-regulated adenylyl cyclase found in brain and in most somatic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2001718186,"CD30 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family of proteins. CD30 can regulate proliferation of lymphocytes and may also play an important role in human immunodeficiency virus replication. However, little is known about CD30 signal transduction. We performed a yeast two-hybrid library screen with the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 and isolated multiple independent cDNAs encoding human tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 1, TRAF2, and CRAF1 (TRAF3). The ability of TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1 to associate with CD30 was confirmed using an in vitro coprecipitation assay, further demonstrating that the interaction was specific and direct. The TRAF-binding domain of CD30 was mapped to the COOH-terminal 36 amino acid residues, which contained two independent binding sites. CRAF1 bound only a single site, which contained the sequence PEQET, whereas TRAF1 and TRAF2 were capable of binding to either the PEQET site or an additional downstream domain. These data indicate that the TRAF protein binding pattern of CD30 differs from other TNF receptor family members and suggest that signaling specificity through TNF receptor family proteins may be achieved through differences in their abilities to bind TRAF proteins.

The T cell activation properties of the TNF receptor family member 4-1BB have been shown to involve the specific ability of its cytoplasmic domain to associate with the tyrosine kinase p56lck (33Kim Y.-J. Pollak K.E. Zhou Z. Shaw A. Bohlen J.B. Fraser M. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1255-1262PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 shows little sequence similarity to any of these receptors (17Gruss H.-J. Dower S.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD30 lacks an obvious death domain or a p56lck-binding site. Therefore, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a cDNA library in order to identify proteins that interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of CD30. Multiple independent cDNA isolates of human TRAF2 (TRAP; 27, 31), TRAF1 (EBI6; 27, 32), and CRAF1 (TRAF3, CAP1, CD40-bp, LAP1; 28-30, 32) were identified. Each of these proteins was found to associate specifically with CD30 in yeast and in an in vitro coprecipitation assay using a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CD30 fusion protein. This is the first demonstration of a direct interaction between TRAF1 and a receptor protein. The region of CD30 required for the interaction with the TRAF proteins was mapped to the COOH-terminal 36 amino acids. This region of CD30 was found to contain a single binding site for CRAF1. However, both TRAF1 and TRAF2 were capable of binding either to the CRAF1-binding site or a downstream site. These results demonstrate that CD30, in addition to its extracellular similarities to TNF receptor type 2 and CD40, shares with these receptors the ability to bind members of the TRAF family of signal transducing molecules. Nevertheless, there appear to be different binding specificities of individual TNF receptor proteins for the TRAF proteins. The differential ability of these receptors to bind distinct members of the TRAF family may, at least partially, account for the differences in their biological activities. The yeast expression vectors pAS1 and pACT have been described previously (34Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The Matchmaker human B cell library was purchased from Clontech and is derived from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed peripheral blood lymphocytes (B cell population). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to construct the wild type and all deleted forms of the CD30 cytoplasmic domain (CD30 cyto). In all cases described below, Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used in order to minimize the possibility of PCR introduced errors. pAS1-CD30 cyto contains the coding sequence for the entire cytoplasmic domain of CD30 (amino acid residues 408-595). Arginine 409 was mutated to a methionine in order to create an NdeI site to facilitate cloning into pAS1. PCR was used to amplify the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 out of a λgt11 cDNA library from the human T cell line HUT78 (Clontech) using the oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-ACGTACGTCATATGAGGGCCTGCAGGAAGCGAATTCGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-AAGGATCCTCACTTTCCAGAGGCAGCTGTG-3′. The PCR products were then ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pAS1. The COOH-terminal deletions of CD30 (Δ124, Δ71, Δ36, Δ19, and Δ9) were made by PCR using antisense oligonucleotides that introduced in-frame stop codons in the appropriate positions. NH2-terminal deletions (ΔN96, ΔN117, and ΔN146) were also constructed by PCR using 5′ primers that inserted an NdeI site in-frame with pAS1 upstream of the appropriate codon. The ΔPEQET internal deletion and point mutations of this sequence were made using the Chameleon mutagenesis system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations were verified by sequencing. Full-length TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1 cDNAs that were isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen were subcloned into Bluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) in order to facilitate in vitro transcription and translation. pACT plasmids containing the full-length TRAF clones were digested with XhoI (in the case of human TRAF2 the digest was partial), and the fragments were ligated into the XhoI site of Bluescript SK(+). GST-CD30 cyto was constructed by using PCR to amplify the CD30 cytoplasmic domain coding sequence from pAS1-CD30 cyto. The sense primer, 5′-GTGGATCCCACCCGAGGGCCTGCAGGAAGCGAATT-3′, added an in-frame BamHI site to the 5′ end that facilitated subcloning into pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). GST-CD28 cyto was constructed similarly by using PCR to amplify the CD28 cytoplasmic domain coding sequence from a plasmid containing a full-length mouse CD28 cDNA. The oligonucleotide primers inserted an in-frame BamHI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end that facilitated subcloning into pGEX-2TK. Yeast two-hybrid library screening and analysis were performed essentially as described in the Matchmaker protocol provided by Clontech using the yeast strain Y153. Briefly, Y153 was transformed with the appropriate pAS1 and pACT plasmid DNA derivatives (for directed assays, 200 ng of each plasmid; for library screening, 30 µg of each plasmid) and then plated on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 25 mM 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) and plates lacking leucine and tryptophan. After 3 days at 30°C, colonies from plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 3-AT were transferred to filters and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. However, in all cases tested, colonies from the plates lacking leucine and tryptophan gave identical results. In general, β-galactosidase activity was apparent within 1 h, but the filters were allowed to incubate for 24 h. In all assays, transformants were tested for both the ability to grow on medium lacking histidine and containing 3-AT and for β-galactosidase expression. Without exception, protein-protein interactions were considered to be positive if both growth in the absence of histidine and β-galactosidase expression were observed. GST coprecipitation assays were performed as described by Lewis et al. (35Lewis B.A. Tullis G. Seto E. Hirokoshi N. Weinmann R. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1628-1636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in XL1 Escherichia coli. 35S-Labeled full-length TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1 were in vitro transcribed/translated from the Bluescript plasmid templates described above in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using the TNT T7/T3-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fluorographed with En3Hance (DuPont NEN) and visualized by autoradiography. To identify proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic domain of CD30, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. The DNA sequence encoding the 188-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of CD30 was cloned into the pAS1 expression vector (34Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) fusing this domain to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. This vector was used to screen a cDNA library prepared from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells cloned into the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain vector pACT (34Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Approximately 700,000 transformants were screened yielding 25 positive clones as defined by growth on medium lacking histidine and containing 3-AT and β-galactosidase expression. These positive clones interacted specifically with the CD30 fusion construct but not with either the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone or a GAL4-CD28 fusion (data not shown). Sequence analysis revealed that 13 of the 25 cDNA clones encoded members of the TRAF family of signal transducing proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, seven independent isolates of human TRAF2, four independent isolates of human TRAF1, and two independent isolates of CRAF1 were obtained. In addition to full-length clones for each member of the TRAF family, several NH2-terminal deletions were obtained, indicating that this domain is not required for interaction with CD30. The CRAF1ΔN125, C6 (Fig. 1), which has a 125-amino acid NH2-terminal and a 6-amino acid COOH-terminal deletion, was the only isolate with a COOH-terminal deletion. Thus, all of the TRAF2, TRAF1, and CRAF1 clones obtained in this screen contain intact TRAF domains at their COOH termini, consistent with previously published data indicating that this domain is necessary and sufficient for association with receptor proteins (28Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.- Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 36Rothe M. Pan M.-P. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The possibility existed that the interaction between the TRAF proteins (TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1) and CD30 in yeast was nonspecific. Furthermore, TRAF1 has not been previously shown to interact directly with receptor proteins. TRAF1 has been shown to interact indirectly with the TNF receptor type 2 by forming heteromers with TRAF2 (27Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Thus, it was formally possible that a TRAF-like protein in yeast might be facilitating the interaction between TRAF1 and CD30. To confirm the specificity of the interaction between CD30 and TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1, the CD30 cyto was fused to glutathione S-transferase. Affinity purified GST-CD30 cyto was tested for its ability to precipitate 35S-labeled in vitro translated full-length TRAF2, TRAF1, and CRAF1. As shown in Fig. 2, each of these proteins could be precipitated with GST-CD30 cyto. In contrast, neither GST alone nor a GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse CD28 protein coprecipitated detectable amounts of TRAF2, TRAF1, or CRAF1, indicating that the interactions between CD30 and the TRAF proteins observed in yeast are specific. In addition, the ability of GST-CD30 cyto to coprecipitate TRAF1 in vitro argues that these proteins associate directly. In order to map the domain(s) of CD30 required for interaction with TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1, COOH-terminal deletion mutants of the CD30 cytoplasmic domain were constructed (Fig. 3A). These mutants were then tested for their ability to interact with the TRAF proteins in yeast (Fig. 3B). In these and subsequent experiments shown in this paper, TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1 clones containing the largest NH2-terminal truncations were used in order to examine the minimal CD30 interaction domain. However, in those cases tested, identical results were obtained with full-length TRAF clones (data not shown). The yeast were cotransformed with plasmids expressing the various CD30 COOH-terminal deletion mutants and the TRAF expression vectors and then assayed for their ability to grow on medium lacking histidine and containing 3-AT and for β-galactosidase activity. The mutants Δ9 and Δ19, which lack the COOH-terminal 9 and 19 amino acids, respectively, associated with TRAF2, TRAF1, and CRAF1. Interestingly, yeast coexpressing the Δ19 mutant and TRAF1 reproducibly did not grow as well or express as much β-galactosidase as wild type or the Δ9 mutation (Figs. 3B and 4C and data not shown), suggesting that although it can interact with TRAF1, the Δ19 mutant has a lower affinity for TRAF1. Mutants Δ36, Δ71, and Δ124 did not interact with either TRAF2, TRAF1, or CRAF1. These data indicate that the domain of CD30 required for interaction with these proteins lies within the COOH-terminal 36 amino acids. Deletion mutants lacking the NH2-terminal 96, 117, and 146 amino acids (ΔN96, ΔN117, and ΔN146, respectively) of the CD30 cytoplasmic domain were also constructed and tested in the yeast two-hybrid assay for the ability to interact with the TRAF proteins (Fig. 3C). Yeast were cotransformed with the vectors expressing the individual NH2-terminal mutations and vectors expressing the TRAF proteins and then assayed for growth on medium lacking histidine and containing 3-AT and for β-galactosidase activity. The empty pACT vector, which expresses only the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain, was also tested to rule out the possibility that the CD30 NH2-terminal mutations could activate transcription in the absence of an interaction with the TRAF proteins. As shown in Fig. 3C, all of the NH2-terminal mutants, including ΔN146, which encodes only the COOH-terminal 42 amino acids of CD30, were capable of interacting with TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1 but not the GAL4 activation domain (pACT) alone. This correlates with the data obtained from the COOH-terminal deletion analysis and indicates that the COOH-terminal 42 amino acids of CD30 are necessary and sufficient for binding to TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1. Computer alignments of the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 with the cytoplasmic domains of other TNFR family members revealed little overall homology. The cytoplasmic domain of CD40 was most similar to the COOH-terminal region of CD30, which contains the putative binding domain for the TRAF proteins (Fig. 4A). The CD40 cytoplasmic domain has been shown to associate with both TRAF2 and CRAF1 (37Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). There are two regions of particularly high similarity between CD40 and CD30. The first is a 5-amino acid stretch with the sequence PEQET, which is almost identical to the sequence PVQET in CD40. The threonine residue (Thr254) in this sequence is known to be required for several functions of CD40 (38Inui S. Kaisho T. Kikutani H. Stamenkovic I. Seed B. Clark E.A. Kishimoto T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 39Sarma V. Lin Z. Clark L. Rust B.M. Tewari M. Noelle R.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12343-12346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), including binding of CRAF1 (30Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PEQET sequence was deleted in the Δ36 mutant (Fig. 4A), which failed to bind TRAF2, TRAF1, and CRAF1. The second region of homology is a 6-amino acid stretch with the sequence EEEGKE. This sequence is contained in the Δ9 mutant but is deleted in the Δ19 mutant (Fig. 4, A and B). As noted above, both the Δ9 and Δ19 constructs were capable of interacting with all of the TRAF proteins in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3B). This suggested that the 10-amino acid sequence between the Δ9 and Δ19 mutations, which contains the EEEGKE sequence, is not required for binding and that the PEQET sequence is most likely the domain involved in binding to the TRAF proteins. To test this possibility, an internal deletion mutant (ΔPEQET) lacking the amino acid sequence PEQET in the context of the wild type CD30 cytoplasmic domain was constructed and then analyzed in a yeast two-hybrid assay for its ability to interact with the TRAF proteins (Fig. 4C). The ΔPEQET mutant failed to bind CRAF1, indicating that this sequence is necessary for CRAF1 binding. Individual alanine substitutions for each of the residues conserved in CD40 (i.e. Pro, Gln, Glu, and Thr) also abolished the ability of CD30 to bind to CRAF1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (not shown). Surprisingly, the ΔPEQET mutant interacted with both TRAF1 and TRAF2, suggesting that these amino acids were either not involved or not absolutely required in the binding of either of these proteins. This result suggested two possibilities. One was that the TRAF1 and TRAF2 binding site(s) were contained in the remaining sequences between the Δ36 and Δ19 mutations. However, these sequences share no homology to CD40. Another possibility was that there were two binding sites for TRAF1 and TRAF2 in the COOH-terminal 36 amino acids of CD30 and that each site alone was capable of binding either TRAF1 or TRAF2 independent of the other. We tested the second possibility by combining the ΔPEQET mutation with the Δ9 and the Δ19 mutations (Fig. 4B) and testing for TRAF binding in yeast. As shown in Fig. 4C, neither the ΔPEQET nor the Δ19 mutations alone abolished TRAF1 or TRAF2 binding. However, the ΔPEQET/Δ19 mutant, which lacks both regions of homology to CD40, did not bind either TRAF1 or TRAF2. In contrast, the ΔPEQET/Δ9 mutation had no effect on either TRAF1 or TRAF2 binding. These data indicate that the region between the Δ9 and Δ19 mutations, which contains the EEEGKE sequence, contains a second binding site for TRAF1 and TRAF2 that can function independently from the PEQET sequence. As seen in Figs. 3B and 4C, TRAF1 does not interact with the Δ19 mutant as well as wild type or Δ9, as judged by the β-galactosidase activities. This suggests that although TRAF1 is capable of interacting with either the PEQET or the EEEGKE sites in yeast, it prefers the EEEGKE site. These results are summarized in Fig. 5. The TNF receptor (TNFR) type 2 and CD40 are known to regulate cellular proliferation (40Tartaglia L.A. Weber R.F. Figari I.S. Reynolds C. Palladino Jr., M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 4357-4366PubMed Google Scholar), and these abilities appear to correlate at least in part with their ability to bind TRAF proteins (27Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 37Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The domain of TNFR type 2 required for induction of NF-κB is also required for its ability to coprecipitate TRAF1 and TRAF2 (27Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The role of TRAF2 in TNFR type 2 signal transduction is further supported by the observation that the overexpression of TRAF2 can induce NF-κB (37Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Threonine 254 in CD40 has been shown to be essential for signaling (38Inui S. Kaisho T. Kikutani H. Stamenkovic I. Seed B. Clark E.A. Kishimoto T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and a threonine to alanine substitution in this position was found to abolish CRAF1 binding (26Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.-H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In addition, the cell survival function of CD40 (45Tsubata T. Wu J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) was found to correlate with its ability to induce Bcl-xL expression (46Choi M.S. Boise L.H. Gottschalk A.R. Quintans J. Thompson C.B. Klaus G.G.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and a COOH-terminal deletion of CD40, which removed the region containing threonine 254, abolished the induction of Bcl-xL, suggesting that CRAF1 binding is required for this effect (47Ishida T. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Ishida S. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5527-5535PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the TRAF proteins appear to play a role in regulating cell proliferation or survival. CD30 has also been shown to regulate cellular proliferation and to induce NF-κB (5Gruss H.-J. Boiani N. Williams D.E. Armitage R.J. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Blood. 1994; 83: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Biswas P. Smith C.A. Goletti D. Hardy E.C. Jackson R.W. Fauci A.S. Immunity. 1995; 2: 587-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22McDonald P.P. Cassatella M.A. Bald A. Maggi E. Romagnani S. Gruss H.-J. Pizzolo G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2870-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Like CD40, CD30 can directly associate with TRAF2 and CRAF1. Unlike TNFR type 2 and CD40, CD30 was also found to directly associate with TRAF1. Previously, TRAF1 was only found to associate indirectly with receptor proteins by forming heteromers with TRAF2 (27Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). We also found that CD30 contained two independent binding sites for the TRAF proteins and that these proteins had different specificities for each site. CRAF1 binding was the most restricted because it recognized only the domain containing the sequence PEQET. TRAF1 was capable of binding to the cytoplasmic tail of CD30 through either the PEQET domain or through the downstream domain, which contains the sequence EEEGKE. However, TRAF1 formed a stronger interaction with the EEEGKE-containing domain as measured by yeast two-hybrid analysis. TRAF2 was the most promiscuous of the three proteins, binding well to either site. The ability of CD30 to bind directly to TRAF1 suggests a mechanism by which CD30 can mediate novel signaling effects. Furthermore, these data indicate that the TRAF protein binding pattern of CD30 differs from that of other members of the TNF receptor family. This suggests that the signaling specificity of these receptors may be determined by their ability to bind different combinations of TRAF proteins. The TRAF proteins are most related in the COOH-terminal TRAF domain, which has been further subdivided into a TRAF-N domain and TRAF-C domain (28Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.- Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 36Rothe M. Pan M.-P. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The TRAF domain is required for the ability of TRAF proteins to form multimers and, in the case of TRAF1 and TRAF2, heteromers (27Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 28Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.- Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 37Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments using CRAF1 and TRAF2 have demonstrated that the TRAF domain encodes the receptor binding function (28Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.- Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 37Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Our data confirm that the ability of TRAF1 to bind to the CD30 receptor is also confined to the carboxyl-terminal TRAF domain as demonstrated by the smallest TRAF1 clone isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Overexpression of a truncated CRAF1 protein containing the CD40-binding domain has been shown to block the ability of CD40 to induce CD23 in transfected cells (28Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.- Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Deletion of the NH2-terminal 87 amino acids of TRAF2 abolishes the ability of TNFR type 2 and CD40 to induce NF-κB in cotransfection assays without affecting its ability to bind TNFR type 2 or CD40 (37Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Thus, the NH2 termini of TRAF proteins appear to be involved in signal transduction. The NH2 terminus of TRAF1 is the most divergent in the TRAF family, suggesting that TRAF1 may have signaling properties that are different than TRAF2 or CRAF1. Furthermore, TRAF1 has a more restricted tissue distribution relative to TRAF2 or CRAF1. Like CD30, TRAF1 appears to be expressed primarily in lymphoid tissues (27Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 32Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E.

Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) indicate that members of the TNF receptor family have distinct TRAF binding properties. We have found that CD30 can associate directly with TRAF1, TRAF2, and CRAF1. In contrast, TNFR type 2 has been shown to associate directly only with TRAF2 (27Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), whereas CD40 has been shown to associate with both CRAF1 and TRAF2 (37Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The differential abilities of the TNF receptor family to bind to TRAF proteins is reminiscent of cytokine receptor signaling through the Jak/STAT signal transduction pathway (48Ivashkiv L.B. Immunity. 1995; 3: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ability of cytokine receptors to bind different combinations of Jaks and STATs allows these receptors to send specific signals. Thus, by binding different combinations of TRAF proteins, TNF receptor proteins may be able to achieve signaling specificity while using an overlapping signal transduction pathway. The analogy to Jak/STAT pathway is further supported by the identification of a fourth member of the TRAF family, CART1 (49Regnier C.H. Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M.-P. Wendling C. Basset Rio M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). CART1 was identified by its differential expression in breast carcinoma cells and was found to localize to the nucleus of these cells, suggesting that TRAFs may be latent cytoplasmic transcription factors (49Regnier C.H. Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M.-P. Wendling C. Basset Rio M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). TRAF2 and TRAF1 were recently shown to bind to c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 (36Rothe M. Pan M.-P. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), which belong to the recently identified family of cellular homologues of the baculovirus IAP protein (36Rothe M. Pan M.-P. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 50Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J. Gilfillan M.C.

Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). It is possible that the cellular IAP proteins may be transcription factors as well. In addition to the differing abilities to bind TRAF proteins, our observation that CD30 contains two nonidentical binding sites for TRAF proteins adds further complexity to the possible CD30-TRAF protein signaling complexes that assemble in cells. Because CD30, like other TNF-related receptors, is likely to trimerize in response to ligand binding and each receptor contains two binding sites for TRAF proteins, the composition of CD30 signaling complexes could be quite divergent in different cell types or under different conditions of stimulation. It will be important to determine the roles played by the individual TRAF proteins during CD30 signal transduction. In addition, there may be other factors involved in CD30 signal transduction. The TRAF-binding domain was localized to the COOH-terminal 36 amino acids of the CD30 cytoplasmic domain, which is 188 amino acids long (16Dürkop H. Latza U. Hummel M. Eitelbach F. Seed B. Stein H. Cell. 1992; 68: 421-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the remaining 153 amino acids of the CD30 cytoplasmic domain have been retained during evolution because they also contribute to the assembly of a CD30 signaling complex. To address these issues, the signaling properties of a CD30 receptor containing the minimal TRAF-binding domain will need to be compared with the wild type receptor tail.

Mutation of tyrosine 974 alone or together with surrounding residues and the deletion of residues 973-975 essentially eliminated AP-2 co-immunoprecipitation with the EGF receptor. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide corresponding to receptor residues 964-978 blocked AP-2 association with the wild-type EGF receptor. These data suggest that AP-2 has only one high-affinity binding site in the EGF receptor composed of Tyr974-containing motif. Receptor mutants that did not bind AP-2 displayed a lower rate of internalization, down-regulation, and turnover compared to wild-type receptors when expressed at high levels. However, similar receptor mutants expressed at low levels were internalized and down-regulated as efficiently as wild-type receptors. Internalization of the mutant receptors lacking the high-affinity binding site for AP-2 was inhibited by K+-depletion of the cells, indicating that their endocytosis required intact coated pits. We suggest that whereas one mechanism of EGF receptor recruitment into coated pits involves high-affinity binding of AP-2 to Tyr974-containing motif, another pathway may be mediated by weak receptor/AP-2 interactions or by proteins other than AP-2.

Receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumAP-2clathrin adaptor protein complex. are rapidly internalized upon EGF binding. After internalization a pool of EGF-occupied receptors are incapable of recycling and targeted to lysosomes (1Beguinot L. Lyall R.M. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Accelerated internalization and reduced recycling of receptors are the main EGF-induced changes in the EGF receptor trafficking which cause rapid depletion of the cellular receptor pool (reviewed in Ref. 3Sorkin A.

The ligand-induced receptor down-regulation is specific for endocytosis of growth factor receptors and many other signal-transducing receptors. However, the molecular details underlying this process are not understood. epidermal growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium clathrin adaptor protein complex. EGF binding accelerates EGF receptor internalization by facilitating receptor recruitment into clathrin-coated pits (1Beguinot L. Lyall R.M. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1993; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Analysis of the kinetics of EGF endocytosis revealed that the specific rate of internalization is maximal when a low number of receptors are occupied by EGF and decreases with the increase of receptor occupancy (9Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The saturability of the endocytic pathway suggested that the mechanisms of EGF-induced receptor endocytosis are somewhat different from those regulating non-saturable endocytosis of cargo receptors, such as receptors for transferrin and low density lipoprotein. For instance, it has been found that tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation of the receptor are necessary for EGF internalization via saturable pathway (11Glenney Jr., J.R. Chen W.S.

However, similar to endocytosis of transferrin and low density lipoprotein receptors, internalization of EGF receptors requires the presence of “endocytic codes” in its intracellular domain. Three regions of the receptor carboxyl terminus have been identified, each was sufficient per se to promote rapid EGF internalization (16Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P.

These regions contain sequences analogous to the endocytic codes of other receptors (17Chang C.-P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G.

Two of these sequence motifs support rapid endocytosis when substituted for the internalization motif of the transferrin receptor (17Chang C.-P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19312-19320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because internalization sequences of the EGF receptor were identified using large deletions of the receptor molecule, it is not clear whether all these codes function in the context of the native full-length EGF receptor. Presence of endocytic codes in the intracellular tail of the receptor correlates with coated pit localization and efficient internalization of the receptor. It is proposed that internalization sequences directly interact with clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-2 and that this interaction represents the mechanism of the selective receptor recognition by coated pits (19Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 20Pearse B. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). AP-2 is the major component of coated pits and vesicles derived from the plasma membrane. It is a heterotetramer containing two large (~100 kDa) subunits (also called adaptins), α (αA or αC) and β, a medium (50 kDa) and a small subunit (17 kDa) (reviewed in Ref. 21Robinson M.S. Curr. Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although functions of the individual subunits are not yet precisely determined, recent report by Ohno et al. (22Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 259: 1872-1875Crossref Scopus (823) Google Scholar) suggested that the medium subunit serves for specific interaction of AP-2 with tyrosine-containing endocytic sequences. The hypothesis of the direct binding of receptors to AP-2 is based on experiments in which this interaction was demonstrated in vitro using purified components (19Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12537-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP-2 has also been shown to form a stoichiometric complex with the EGF receptor which can be immunopurified from the crude cell lysate under mild conditions (26Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 27Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recently, AP-2 has been found to interact with EGF receptors in vitro (28Boll W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1168-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Nesterov A. Kurten R. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6320-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the co-immunoprecipitation of AP-2 with full-length transferrin, low density lipoprotein receptors, and other classical markers of coated pit internalization has not been demonstrated. Thus, although the important role of AP-2 for clathrin-dependent endocytosis is well established by in vivo and in vitro experiments (30Chin D.J. Straubinder R.M. Acton S. Nathke I. Brodsky F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9289-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Hille A. Klumperman J. Geuze H.J. Peters C. Brodsky F.M. von Figure K. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is still not formally proven that the direct interaction of receptors and AP-2 is essential for the endocytosis via coated pits in vivo. In this report the binding site for AP-2 in the full-length EGF receptor was localized using receptor mutagenesis and peptide-competition studies. Functional analysis revealed that the importance of this site for EGF receptor endocytosis was dependent on the level of receptor expression in the cell. EGF was obtained from Collaborative Research Inc. 125I-EGF was prepared as described previously (33Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit 986 and 451 antibody to EGF receptor (2Stoscheck C.M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. G. Carpenter (Vanderbilt University). Anti-EGF receptor rabbit serum 2913 (specific to intracellular domain) was described elsewhere (1Beguinot L. Lyall R.M. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2384-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies AC1-M11 that recognize α-subunits of AP-2 were a gift from Dr. M. S. Robinson (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom). Polyclonal antibodies 31 (Ab31) to αC-subunit were developed and characterized in our previous studies (27Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were used as the IgG-fraction purified from the serum using Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The human EGF receptor internalization mutants MI91, MI92, MI93, MI94, MI95, and MI96 were obtained by substituting single or multiple amino acid residues with alanines, while in MI90 Tyr974 was substituted with phenylalanine. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in M13mp19 encoding the AccI-HincII EGF receptor cDNA fragment (3013-3625), as described previously (13Helin K. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8363-8368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single-stranded template was prepared and mutagenesis performed as described by Taylor et al. (34Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: MI90 (Y974F): 5′-CAGACTCCAACTTCTCGTGCCCCCTGA-3′, MI 91 (Y974A); 5′-CAGACTCCAACTTCCCGTGCCCCCTGA-3′. A second round of mutagenesis on MI91 was performed to construct MI92 (F973A/Y974A) and MI93 (F973A/Y974A/R975A) using as primers: 5′-CAGACTCCAACCGCCCGTGCCCTGA-3′ and 5′-TACAGACTCCAACCGCCTGCCCTGATGCAT-3′; on MI93 to create MI94 (N972A/F973A/Y974A/R975A) using as primer 5′-TACAGACTCCCGCCGCCGCTGCCCTGATGCAT-3′. Similarly, MI94 was used to create MI95 (P968A/N972A/F973A/Y974A/R975A) and MI 96 (P966A/P968A/N972A/F973A/Y974A/R975A) using as primers 5′-AATGCATTTGCCAAGTCTACAGACTCC-3′ (P968A) and 5′-AATGCATTTGCAAGTCTACAGACTCC-3′ (P966A/P968A). The mutated fragments were cloned back into the pMMTV-EGF-R vector and the mutated EGF receptor cDNAs (SacII-XhoI) subcloned into the pCO 11 vector (36Velu T.J. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Beguinot L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1772-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to produce pMI90, pMI91, pMI92, pMI93, pMI94, pMI95, and pMI96, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis was used to construct MI Δ93 (Δ973-5 mutant) with a 3 amino acid internal deletion (ΔPhe973-Tyr974-Arg975), and double mutant MI 122 (R975A/L977A) as described by Higushi et al. (37Higushi R. Innis M.A. Gelfard D.A. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide of Methods and Application. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 173Google Scholar). Polymerase chain mutagenesis was performed in pMMTV-EGF-R, using as upstream primer 5′-GCCACCCATATGTACCATCGATGTCTACATGATCATGGTC-3′ (3007-3030, ClaI) and downstream primer 5′-GCAGGGCTGTCGAATGTGCTGTTGACACAGGTGGGCTGGA-3′ (3650-3611, HincII). Primers for Δ973-5 mutagenesis were 5′-AGACTCCAACGCCCTGATGG-3′ (3167-3196, direct) and 5′-CCATCAGGGCGTTGGAGTCT-3′ (inverse); for MI122, 5′-AACTTCTACTGCCGATGGATGAA-3′ (direct) (R975A/L977A) and 5′-TTCATCCATCGGCAGTAGAAGTT-3′ (inverse). The ClaI-HincII fragments were subcloned back in the pMMTV-EGF receptor vector and sequenced by dideoxy sequencing to confirm the mutation and ensure the absence of secondary mutations. The mutated EGF receptor cDNAs (SacII-XhoI) were cloned back in the pCO 11 vector to give rise to pMIΔ93 and pMI122. NIH3T3 cells, which contain about 5,000 mouse receptors/cell, were used for transfections. Transfections and G418 selection were performed as described previously (38Helin K. Velu T. Martin P. Vass W.C. Allevato G. Lowy D. Beguinot L. Oncogene. 1991; 6 (b): 3610-3617Google Scholar). As determined by quantitative 125I-EGF binding, internalization mutant receptors were selected expressing 0.8-9.0 × 105 EGF receptors/cell. The numbers of receptors per cell are indicated for each individual clone of mutant transfectants in Fig. 5. Three NIH3T3 lines expressing approximately 1 × 105 (Cl pCO11) (38Helin K. Velu T. Martin P. Vass W.C. Allevato G. Lowy D. Beguinot L. Oncogene. 1991; 6 (b): 3610-3617Google Scholar), 2.5 × 105 (39Waters C.M. Overholser K.A. Sorkin A. Carpenter G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and 4-5 × 105 (Cl17) (14Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) human wild-type EGF receptors per cell were used. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% newborn calf serum with antibiotics and glutamine. Cells were grown on 150-mm culture dishes and used when confluent. Cells were treated or not with EGF (100 ng/ml) in binding medium (DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.3), washed with Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized by scraping with a rubber policeman in TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 544 µM iodoacetamide, 10 µg/ml aprotinin) in the absence or presence of sodium deoxycholate (1%) followed by gentle rotation for 10 min at 4°C. Lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Approximately 50 or 95-99% of the total cellular AP-2 pool was found in the supernatants after centrifugation of TGH or TGH-sodium deoxycholate extracts, respectively. Supernatants were incubated with anti-EGFR (986, 451) or Ab31 for 3-15 h at 4°C and then 30-60 min after the addition of Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Preimmune rabbit serum or rabbit IgG (Zymed Inc.) were used for nonspecific control. AP-precipitations were also controlled for nonspecific immunoreactivity by immunoprecipitations with the specific anti-AP IgG in the presence of an excess of the recombinant antigen peptide (27Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with TGH or TGH-sodium deoxycholate supplemented with 100 mM NaCl and then once without NaCl. 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used to separate proteins. Transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and protein immunoblotting were carried out as described (27Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The top (above the 116-kDa molecular mass marker) and bottom portions of the nitrocellulose membrane were blotted, respectively, with the mixture of antibodies to the EGF receptor and adaptin antibody (AC1-M11 to both α-subunits or Ab31 to αC-subunit). Sheep antibodies to mouse IgG (Cappel Inc.) or protein A (Zymed Inc.) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham or DuPont NEN) were used to detect primary mouse or rabbit antibodies, respectively. A Bio-Rad PhosphorImager was used for quantitation. Peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 964-978 of the EGF receptor was synthesized and purified by Peptide Technologies Corp. WT-3 cells grown on 250-mm dishes were washed with Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in TGH as described above. Aliquotes of lysate were incubated with the peptide (0-1 mM) for 10 min at 4°C and then sodium deoxycholate (1%) was added to the lysates to induce AP-2 binding to EGF receptors. EGF receptors and AP-2 were then immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR or Ab31, respectively. EGF receptors and α-adaptins were detected, correspondingly, in AP-2 and EGF receptor immunoprecipitates as described above. Alternatively, receptor or AP-2 immunoprecipitates were incubated in 100-200 µl of TGH-sodium deoxycholate containing peptide 964-978 (up to 1 mM) for 1 h at 4°C, washed in TGH-sodium deoxycholate followed by detection of co-precipitated receptors or α-adaptins by immunoblotting as described before. Peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of EGF receptor between 1168 and 1179 (containing Tyr1173) (40Miloso M. Mazzotti M. Vass W.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19557-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used as a control for the specificity of peptide 964-978. To monitor 125I-EGF internalization, cells cultured in 12-well dishes were incubated with 125I-EGF in binding medium at 37°C for 1-6 min. After indicated times, the medium was aspirated, the monolayers were rapidly washed 3 times with DMEM to remove unbound ligand and then incubated for 5 min with 0.2 M acetic acid (pH 2.8) containing 0.5 M NaCl at 4°C. The acid wash was combined with another short rinse with the same acidic solution to determine the amount of surface-bound 125I-EGF. Finally, the cells were lysed in 1 N NaOH to quantitate internalized radioactivity. The ratio of internalized and surface radioactivity was plotted against time and the specific rate constant for internalization ke was calculated as linear regression coefficient. Nonspecific binding was measured for each time point in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled EGF, and was not more than 3-7% of the total counts. To monitor EGF receptor down-regulation, cells on 12-well dishes were incubated for various times with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) in binding medium at 37°C, rinsed with cold DMEM, and surface-bound EGF was removed by successive incubating the cells with ice-cold 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 0.5 M NaCl for 2 min and 20 s followed by two rinses with DMEM. This acid wash procedure did not affect binding properties of EGF receptors. The number of binding sites on the cell surface was then determined by incubating the cells with 100 ng/ml 125I-EGF at 4°C for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was measured for each time point in the presence of 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled EGF, and was 5-15% of the total counts. Specific binding is reported. Potassium depletion of cells was performed as described by Cupers et al. (41Cupers P. Veithen A. Kiss A. Baudhuin P. Courtoy P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were subjected to hypotonic shock by incubation in DMEM/water (1:1) at 37°C for 5 min. Cells were then incubated in simplified medium (140 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.3) devoid of KCl at 37°C for 1 h, and subsequently with 125I-EGF (1 ng/ml) in the same medium for 1-6 min at 37°C. Measurements of the amounts of surface and internalized radioactivity were performed as described above for internalization experiments. Control cells were incubated in simplified medium containing 10 mM KCl. NIH3T3 expressing wild-type and mutant EGF receptors were plated in 35-mm dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish. 24 h later cells were incubated at 37°C for different times in DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum and 100 ng/ml EGF or immediately lysed. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (40Miloso M. Mazzotti M. Vass W.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19557-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Total proteins were measured by Bio-Rad. Cell lysate (80 µg of total protein) were run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and the EGF receptor protein was detected by blotting with polyclonal antibody 2913 as described (40Miloso M.

Blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film at −80°C and developed. Quantitation was performed using a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer. Turnover rate of EGF receptors were calculated by linear regression analysis of time of incubation with EGF. We have previously demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal residues 973-1186 of the EGF receptor are necessary for receptor interaction with AP-2 (27Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The lack of receptor-AP interaction correlated with impaired internalization and down-regulation of the receptor mutant in which these 214 residues were truncated (14Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S.

The putative EGF receptor internalization sequence 972NFYRAL977, located in the carboxyl terminus distal to the core tyrosine kinase domain, has similarity to a large number of endocytic signals with the more general motif of tyrosine and a hydrophobic residue (Leu) in i+3 position (42Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 43Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether this motif is involved in AP-2 binding to the EGF receptor, a deletion mutant lacking residues FYR was constructed (Fig. 1). Furthermore, to analyze the role of single amino acids in this domain, Tyr974 and surrounding residues were substituted for by alanine. In addition, Tyr974 was also mutated to phenylalanine. EGF receptor single and multiple point mutants and the deletion mutant were expressed in NIH3T3 cells. The level of expression of transfected receptors in different cell clones varied from 0.8 to 9.0 × 105 receptors per cell. Three clones of NIH3T3 cells expressing 1.0 × 105 (WT-1), 2.5 × 105 (WT-2), and 4 to 5 × 105 (WT-3) human wild-type EGF receptors per cell were used as control for the mutant transfected cells. To study interaction of EGF receptors with AP-2, the co-immunoprecipitation assay was employed. EGF receptors were immunoprecipitated, and the presence of AP-2 in immunoprecipitates was tested by blotting with antibodies specific to α-subunits of AP-2 (AC1-M11 or Ab31). In preliminary experiments, we found that the association of AP-2 with wild-type EGF receptors that had not been activated by EGF, was significantly elevated when sodium deoxycholate was included in Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer (TGH) during or after cell solubilization. Co-immunoprecipitation of AP-2 and EGF receptors recovered from EGF-treated cells was similar or even increased in the presence of sodium deoxycholate compared to co-precipitation in TGH lysates. This allowed us to measure EGF receptor/AP-2 association in cells expressing low levels of receptors. Furthermore, in the presence of sodium deoxycholate the association was EGF-independent (Fig. 2A, left panel) and could not be influenced by the different kinetics of EGF-induced endocytosis in various cell lines. Fig. 2 shows that α-subunits of AP-2 were readily detected in immunoprecipitates of wild-type receptors. Quantitations showed that up to 5% of the total cellular pool of AP-2 was associated with EGF receptors. In contrast, virtually no AP-2 was found in immunoprecipitates of Δ973-5 mutant. Moreover, single point mutation of Tyr974 alone or together with surrounding residues eliminated co-precipitation of AP-2 with EGF receptors (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, AP-2/receptor co-immunoprecipitation was highly sensitive to the conserved substitution of Tyr974 to phenylalanine (Phe974 mutant, Fig. 2A). Receptor-AP interaction was also impaired by the double mutation of Arg975 and Leu977 (R975A/L977A). These data suggested that the 973FYRAL977 motif is critical for AP-2 binding to the EGF receptor. The ability of sodium deoxycholate to induce an in vitro AP-2/receptor association was used to test whether AP-2 binding to wild-type EGF receptors can be blocked by the soluble peptide containing FYRAL motif. TGH lysates of WT-3 cells were incubated with the synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence His964-Met978 of the EGF receptor, and then sodium deoxycholate (1%) was added to induce receptor-AP interaction (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3A, preincubation of lysates with 0.3 mM peptide 964-978 (approximately 20,000-fold molar excess compared to the EGF receptor) blocked sodium deoxycholate-induced co-immunoprecipitation of AP-2 with EGF receptors.

Here we have investigated the contribution of p21 in inhibiting different cyclin-CDK complexes that drive different cell cycle transitions following UV irradiation-induced DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts and immortalized rodent fibroblasts. When cells were exposed to a low dose of UV irradiation, both p53 and p21 were induced; the protein kinase activities associated with Cdc2, Cdk2, and Cdk4 were inhibited; and there was a good correlation between their inhibition and binding to p21. p21 alone is likely to be sufficient for the inhibition of Cdk2 because all the cyclin-complexed forms of Cdk2 were associated with p21 after irradiation. In contrast, only a small proportion of Cdk4 and Cdc2 was complexed with p21, although the level of Cdk4 associated with either p21 or p27 was increased after irradiation. Furthermore, recombinant p21 added to an unirradiated cell lysate at the same level as that induced by irradiation damage inhibited only the kinase activity associated with Cdk2. Cdc2 is likely to be inhibited by Thr-14/Tyr-15 phosphorylation after irradiation because Cdc2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated, and recombinant Cdc25 was able to increase its kinase activity significantly. Taken together, these results suggest that different CDKs are inhibited by different mechanisms following UV-induced DNA damage: Cdk2 is inhibited by the elevated level of p21; Cdk4 is inhibited by cooperation of p21 with other CDK inhibitors, like p27, and possibly by phosphorylation; and Cdc2 is inhibited by Thr-14/Tyr-15 phosphorylation.

The activity of CDKs is tightly regulated by an intricate system of protein-protein interaction and phosphorylation. Association with a cyclin subunit is absolutely required for CDK activation. The activity of the kinase holoenzyme is increased by phosphorylation of Thr-161 and inhibited by phosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15. Thr-161 is phosphorylated by the CDK-activating kinase (reviewed in Ref. 4Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar) and, at least in Cdk2, can be dephosphorylated by the CDK-interacting phosphatase KAP (5Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The Wee1 protein kinase can phosphorylate Tyr-15 of Cdc2 (reviewed in Ref. 4Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar), and the membrane-associated Wee1-related kinase Myt1 can phosphorylate both Thr-14 and Tyr-15 (6Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R.

The activity of CDKs is also negatively regulated by binding to protein inhibitors; these CDK inhibitors fall into two families based on sequence homology. One CDK inhibitor family includes p15INK4B (7Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar), p16INK4A (8Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D.

Cell. 1995; 83: 993-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). The other CDK inhibitor family includes p21 (also called CAP20, CIP1, Pic1, Sdi1, and WAF1), p27 (Kip1) (13Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massagué J.

In contrast to the p16 family, p21 can bind and inhibit a wider spectrum of CDKs, including Cdk2, Cdk4, and, weakly, Cdc2 (32Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.-H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism through which p21 inhibits CDKs is unknown; there is evidence suggesting that when one molecule of p21 associates with a single cyclin-CDK heterodimer, the complex is still active and that more than one molecule of p21 is required to inhibit a cyclin-CDK complex (32Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.-H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol.

As well as directly inhibiting the kinase activity of cyclin-CDK complexes, p21 also blocks the phosphorylation of the activating threonine residue in CDKs by CDK-activating kinase (34Aprelikova O. Xiong Y. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18195-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Residues ~10-80 of p21, p27, and p57 are related in sequence, and this region has been identified as the cyclin- and CDK-binding region. p21 can also associate with PCNA (35Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z.

Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The PCNA-binding region is distinct from the cyclin-CDK-binding region and lies at the very C terminus of p21 (40Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 41Goubin F. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2281-2287PubMed Google Scholar, 42Luo Y.

Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 42Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). When cellular DNA is damaged, continued progression through the cell cycle and DNA replication are undesirable because this would lead to increased DNA mutagenesis and contribute to tumorigenesis. Two options adopted by damaged cells are either to stop the cell cycle, thus allowing time for the DNA to be repaired, or to eliminate the damaged cells by apoptosis. Both cell cycle arrest (45Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar) and apoptosis (46Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J.

Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2767) Google Scholar) after ionizing irradiation are dependent on p53 function. The level and activity of p53 are increased following DNA damage, but exactly how the cell detects the damaged DNA and sends a signal to regulate p53 is unclear. Once activated, p53 then induces the expression of p21, which in turn may be responsible for the cell cycle arrest. About 50% of all tumors contain p53 mutations (49Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar); hence, it is likely that the failure to induce p21 in cells with mutated p53 is one of the key mechanisms of tumorigenesis. It has long been known that UV irradiation stimulates the accumulation of p53 (50Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and that the p53 response induced by UV irradiation differs from that induced by ionizing irradiation (51Lu X. Lane D.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 765-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). There is a good correlation between radiation-induced DNA damage and induction of p21 (52Li Y. Jenkins C.W.

Whether p21 is sufficient to account for the inhibition of cyclin-CDK activities after DNA damage is clearly a key question. Mice that lack p21 develop normally without observable defects up to 7 months (56Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar), which is in marked contrast to mice that lack p53, which develop tumors spontaneously (57Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery C.A.J. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, p21−/− embryonic fibroblasts are significantly impaired in their ability to arrest in G1 following DNA damage by ionizing irradiation (56Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar, 58Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that p21 is important, but not totally sufficient for the DNA damage checkpoint. In contrast, the lack of p21 does not affect p53-dependent apoptosis in thymocytes (56Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar, 58Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J.

Here we set out to investigate the contribution of p21 to the inhibition of different cyclin-CDK complexes after UV-induced DNA damage in fibroblasts. We found that p21 is probably only sufficient for the inhibition of Cdk2, whereas Thr-14/Tyr-15 phosphorylation is likely to be critical for Cdc2 inhibition. In this study, we have used normal human diploid fibroblast cell strains (AG1523 and HSF8), mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, and normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts, which are all relatively “normal” cell lines containing functional p53. Essentially the same results were obtained with these different cells, and most of the data presented here were obtained with AG1523 cells. Normal human foreskin AG1523 diploid fibroblasts were obtained from the National Institute on Aging Cell Repository, Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ). Normal human HSF8 fibroblasts were cultured from human neonatal foreskin. 2W. Jiang, unpublished results. Mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and NRK cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 10% CO2. AG1523 and HSF8 cells were used between passages 8 and 25. Cell-free extracts were prepared as described (60Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of cell lysates was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay system (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, ~5 × 106 cells were harvested, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide prior to FACS analysis using a FACScan machine (Becton Dickinson Advanced Cellular Biology). Nearly confluent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum and 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (DuPont NEN) for 12 h in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 10% CO2. To measure the half-life of p21, the labeled cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, irradiated with the indicated dose of UV (see below), and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cell-free extracts were prepared at the indicated times as described above and immunoprecipitated with anti-p21 antibodies. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of 35S-labeled p21 was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Cells were irradiated with UV essentially as described by Lu and Lane (51Lu X. Lane D.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 765-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to near confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 10% CO2. The medium was removed, and the cells were irradiated with the indicated dose of UV (UV-C) in a Stratalinker UV cross-linker 2400 apparatus (Stratagene). Fresh medium was then added, and cells were returned to the incubator. Unless stated otherwise, cells were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared as described above 12 h after irradiation. GST-Cdc25B and GST-Wee1 were as described (5Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The GST-Rb construct containing Rb residues 768-928 was a gift from J. Wang (University of California at San Diego). Human p21 with a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus (p21-H6 in pET21d) was a gift from M. Howell (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London). Expression of GST- and histidine-tagged proteins in bacteria and purification by GSH-agarose and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography, respectively, were as described (60Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates equilibrated with kinase buffer (80 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mM EGTA, 15 mM Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) were mixed with 10 µl of kinase buffer containing 50 µM ATP, 1.25 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 µg of histone H1 or 2 µg of GST-Rb. No unlabeled ATP was added in assays of histone H1 kinase activity associated with p21. The samples were incubated at 23°C for 30 min, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 30 µl of SDS sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was detected and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. Rabbit anti-Cdk2 and rabbit anti-cyclin B1 antisera (61Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Howell M. Ershler M.A. Belyavsky A. Hunt T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2789-2799PubMed Google Scholar), the A17 anti-Cdc2 monoclonal antibody (62Kobayashi H. Golsteyn R. Poon R. Stewart E. Gannon J.

Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) were as described previously. Anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (PC10) (63Waseem N.H. Lane D.P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 121-129PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from J. Gannon and T. Hunt (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, South Mimms, Great Britain). These antibodies recognized the respective antigens from human, mouse, and rat origins. Anti-human cyclin E monoclonal antibodies (HE12 for immunoblotting and HE172 for immunoprecipitation) were generous gifts from E.

Anti-cyclin D1 polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits against the C-terminal peptide (CTPTDVRDVDI) and recognized human, mouse, and rat cyclin D1. Anti-human Cdk4 antiserum was raised in rabbits against the C-terminal peptide (CHSYLHKDEGNPE); on immunoblots, but not by immunoprecipitation, this antibody also recognized a cross-reactive band migrating just below Cdk4. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were a mixture of monoclonal antibodies PY20 and PY72. Anti-mouse and anti-rat p53 monoclonal antibody (Ab122) and anti-human p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-126) were gifts from A. Tsou and W. Eckhart (The Salk Institute). Anti-human p16 antibody was raised in rabbits against a C-terminal peptide of human p16 (CNHARIDAAEGPSDI). Rabbit anti-mouse p27 antisera were raised either against the C-terminal peptide of mouse p27 or against full-length GST-p27 (14Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). Anti-human p27 antibodies were a monoclonal antibody for immunoblotting (Pharmingen, 13231A) (which also recognized mouse and rat p27) and a 1:1 mixture of two polyclonal antibodies for immunoprecipitation (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-527 and sc-528) (a gift from G. Orend, La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA). Anti-p21 antibodies were as follows: AbI, a polyclonal antibody raised against human GST-p21 (Pharmingen, 15431); AbII, a monoclonal antibody raised against full-length human p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-817) (a gift from A. Tsou and W. Eckhart); or AbIII, a purified polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide of p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-397). The AbI and AbII anti-p21 antibodies only recognized human p21, whereas the AbIII anti-p21 antibody recognized p21 from human, mouse, and rat. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (60Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); immunoblotting was also performed as described (64Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), except that a SuperSignal CL-HRP substrate system (Pierce) was used to detect the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunodepletions were performed as described (60Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), except that immunodepletion experiments were performed with two rounds instead of three rounds of immunoprecipitation. To determine whether there is a good correlation between the levels of p53 and p21 after UV-induced DNA damage, we irradiated cells with different doses of UV (UV-C) and examined the amounts of p53, p21, and other cell cycle regulatory proteins in the cells by immunoblotting. UV-C was used instead of solar UV-A and UV-B because we primarily intended to use UV as a source of DNA-damaging agent instead of generating active oxygen intermediates (65Tyrrell R.M. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that an increase in p53 level was detected after normal human fibroblasts were irradiated with a UV dose of 30 J/m2 and remained elevated up to the highest dose used (60 J/m2). In contrast to p53, however, although p21 was induced at low doses of irradiation as expected (increased at 30 J/m2 and peaked at 40 J/m2), p21 was present only at the basal level at UV doses of 50 J/m2 or higher. Similar results were observed with NRK (Fig. 1B) and Swiss 3T3 (Fig. 1C) cells. Staining with anti-p21 antibodies followed by immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that >90% of the cells expressed an elevated level of p21 after irradiation with a UV dose of 30 J/m2 (data not shown). The failure to see p21 induction at higher doses of UV is striking since p53 was present at a very high level in these cells. Previously, we found that when Swiss 3T3 cells are irradiated with UV, both p53 and p21 are induced, whereas the level of the p21-related inhibitor p27 is reduced (60Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances (which is equivalent to 40 J/m2 for AG1523 cells shown in Fig. 1A), cyclin levels also decrease; most notably, cyclin D1 is destroyed much faster than the rest, which causes the p27 that is normally associated with cyclin D1 to become transiently redistributed to cyclin A/E-Cdk2. This redistribution of p27 may contribute to the rapid inactivation of Cdk2 following DNA damage. Similar results were observed with normal human fibroblasts (Fig. 1A); cyclins (A, B1, D1, and E) and p27 were significantly reduced by 12 h after irradiation at 40 J/m2, when the p21 level was at a maximum. We observed that at lower UV doses (20-30 J/m2), the levels of cyclins B1 and D1 were unchanged, but the levels of cyclins A and E and p27 were slightly elevated. CDK levels (Cdc2, Cdk2, and Cdk4) did not change significantly at UV doses up to 60 J/m2, although at higher UV doses (40 J/m2 or higher), the phosphorylation-modified forms of Cdc2 (upper band, representing Thr-14/Tyr-15-phosphorylated forms) and Cdk2 (lower band, representing the Thr-160-phosphorylated form) were significantly reduced, as expected based on the destruction of their cyclin partners. The level of another CDK inhibitor, p16, did not vary significantly after UV irradiation. We have not examined the levels of other p16 family inhibitors. In this paper, we focus on the role of p21 in cells arrested at two different levels of DNA damage: at a relatively low dose of UV (30 J/m2), when p21 was induced and the level of cyclins and CDKs remained high (Fig. 1), whereas their activities were inhibited (see below); and at a relatively high dose of UV (60 J/m2), when the level of p21 did not increase.

In an effort to further improve the pharmacological properties of antisense oligonucleotides, structure-activity studies on this 17-mer sequence were expanded to examine both the effects of replacing phosphorothioate backbone linkages with phosphodiester linkages and the effects of incorporating various 2′-sugar modifications into phosphorothioate and phosphodiester oligonucleotides on oligonucleotide stability against nucleases in vitro and on antisense activity in cells. Replacement of three or more phosphorothioate linkages with phosphodiester linkages greatly compromised both nuclease resistance and antisense activity, and these effects correlated directly with the number of phosphodiester linkages incorporated into the oligonucleotide. However, substantial nuclease resistance, sufficient for obtaining potent antisense effects in cells, was conferred to phosphodiester oligonucleotides by incorporation of appropriate 2′-alkoxy sugar modifications. Nuclease stability and antisense activity imparted by these sugar modifications in phosphodiester backbones correlated with the size of the 2′-alkoxy substituent (pentoxy > propoxy > methoxy > deoxy). Furthermore, antisense activity mediated by oligonucleotides that exhibit partial resistance to nucleolytic degradation was dependent on both oligonucleotide concentration and the duration of oligonucleotide treatment.

Furthermore, antisense activity mediated by oligonucleotides that exhibit partial resistance to nucleolytic degradation was dependent on both oligonucleotide concentration and the duration of oligonucleotide treatment. Susceptibility of unmodified phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides to nucleolytic degradation by intracellular and extracellular nucleases has made them unattractive molecules for oligonucleotide therapeutics. Reports on the stability of unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides in biological fluids have demonstrated half-lives for these molecules as short as 5 min in serum and 30 min in living cells (1Cazenave C. Chevrier M. Thuong N.T. Helene C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10507-10521Google Scholar, 2Tidd D.M. Warenius H.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1989; 60: 343-350Google Scholar, 3Shaw J.P. Kent K. Bird J.

The primary mechanism of oligodeoxynucleotide degradation in serum has been reported to be 3′-exonuclease activity, whereas both endonuclease and exonuclease activity have been reported to play significant roles in the degradation of these molecules in cells (2Tidd D.M. Warenius H.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1989; 60: 343-350Google Scholar, 3Shaw J.P. Kent K. Bird J. Fishback J. Froehler B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 747-750Google Scholar, 4Woolf T.M. Jennings C.G.B.

Ther. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). To alleviate the problem of nucleolytic degradation, chemical modifications of the natural phosphodiester backbone have been introduced into oligonucleotides to increase their stability in biological systems (8Cook P.D. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1991; 6: 585-607Google Scholar, 9Cook P.D. Crooke S.T. LeBleu B. Antisense Research and Applications. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 149Google Scholar). The most commonly employed synthetic modification designed to reduce oligonucleotide sensitivity toward nucleases is the phosphorothioate analog, created by replacing one of the nonbridging oxygen atoms of the internucleotide linkage with sulfur (10Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-372Google Scholar). Stein and co-workers (11Stein C.A. Subasinghe C. Shinozuka K. Cohen J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3209-3221Google Scholar) have reported that the stability of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides against purified nucleases in vitro varies greatly depending on oligonucleotide sequence and the type of nuclease examined. Studies have also been performed demonstrating that uniform modification of oligonucleotides with nuclease-resistant linkages is not required to confer enhanced stability. For example, increased resistance to degradation in vitro can be achieved by substitution of one or more phosphodiester linkages at the 3′-end of an oligonucleotide with phosphorothioate modifications (2Tidd D.M. Warenius H.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1989; 60: 343-350Google Scholar, 3Shaw J.P. Kent K. Bird J. Fishback J. Froehler B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 747-750Google Scholar, 4Woolf T.M. Jennings C.G.B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5743-5748Google Scholar). Alternating phosphorothioate modifications with phosphodiester linkages has also been shown to increase the stability of these molecules against purified nucleases in vitro (5Hoke G.D. Draper K. Freier S.M. Gonzalez C. Driver V.B. Zounes M.C. Ecker D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5743-5748Google Scholar). Despite the fact that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides display many attractive features, some potential limitations do exist with these compounds. For example, high concentrations of phosphorothioates have been shown to competitively inhibit a variety of nucleases and polymerases (6Crooke R.M. Graham M.J. Cooke M.E. Crooke S.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 462-473Google Scholar, 7Crooke S.T. Graham M.J. Zuckerman J.E. Brooks D. Conklin B.S. Cummins L.L. Greig M.J. Guinosso C.J. Kornbrust D. Manoharan M. Sasmor H.M. Schleich T.

Dev. 1994; 4: 201-211Google Scholar). Although these potential limitations have not proven to be problematic in clinical trials to date, evaluation of novel oligonucleotide modifications that reduce phosphorothioate content but maintain stability against nucleolytic degradation is obviously warranted. Enhanced nuclease stability of phosphodiester oligonucleotides containing modified nucleosides has been investigated with some success. Incorporation of α-anomers into oligonucleotides has been shown to dramatically increase their stability against nucleolytic degradation (19Morvan F. Rayner B. Imbach J.L. Thenet S. Bertrand J.R. Paoletti J. Malvy C. Paoletti C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3421-3437Google Scholar, 20Bacon T.A. Morvan F. Rayner B. Imbach J.-L. Wickstrom E. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 311-314Google Scholar). Significant enhancement of nuclease resistance has also been demonstrated in oligonucleotides that contain a methylene group in place of the oxygen in the ribose ring (21Perbost M. Lucas M. Chavis C. Pompon A. Baumgartner H. Rayner B. Griengl H. Imbach J.-L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 742-744Google Scholar). Replacement of the 2′-sugar deoxy substituent with 2′-O-methyl and 2′-O-allyl modifications has been reported to increase oligonucleotide stability toward various nucleases under cell-free conditions (22Sproat B.S. Lamond A.I. Beijer B. Neuner P. Ryder U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3373-3386Google Scholar, 23Iribarren A.M. Sproat B.S. Neuner P. Sulston I. Ryder V. Lamond A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7747-7751Google Scholar). Cummins et al. have extended these studies by demonstrating that the sensitivity of a variety of 2′-alkoxy phosphodiester oligonucleotides toward snake venom phosphodiesterase under cell-free conditions is dependent on the size of the 2′-substituent with nuclease resistance correlating directly with 2′-alkoxy chain length (24Cummins L.L. Owens S.R. Risen L.M. Lesnik E.A. Freier S.M. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Cook P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2019-2024Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that fluorescently labeled 2′-O-methyl and 2′-O-allyl modified phosphodiester oligonucleotides are detectable in mammalian cells for greater periods of time following microinjection, as compared with fluorescently labeled unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides (25Fisher T.L. Terhorst T. Cao X. Wagner R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3857-3865Google Scholar). Despite the progress achieved investigating the stability of modified oligonucleotides toward nucleases under cell-free conditions, reports directly demonstrating a relationship between the level of nuclease resistance observed for a modified oligonucleotide under cell-free conditions and the degree of antisense activity obtained in cells are rare. Unfortunately, conclusions regarding the level and duration of antisense activity that will be obtained by a modified, “nuclease-resistant,” oligonucleotide based on the extrapolation of results from cell-free nuclease assays can be misleading. One reason for this is that the level of nuclease activity that must be overcome by an effective antisense oligonucleotide prior to, during, and after cell uptake is unknown. Furthermore, different cell types and intracellular compartments contain different types of nucleases and levels of nuclease activity (26Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 1Google Scholar). Additionally, sequence and secondary structure can greatly affect the sensitivity of an oligonucleotide to nucleolytic degradation (24Cummins L.L. Owens S.R. Risen L.M. Lesnik E.A. Freier S.M. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Cook P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2019-2024Google Scholar). Thus, it is essential to directly compare cell-free nuclease results with antisense effects in cells when drawing conclusions regarding the utility of a nuclease- resistant modification for the purpose of antisense exploitation. We have previously described a 17-mer phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the codon 12 region of mutant Ha-ras (GGC → GTC) that displays selective inhibition of mutant Ha-ras expression, relative to wild type, in cells (27Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Google Scholar). Additionally, structure-activity studies have been performed on this phosphorothioate in which various 2′-sugar modifications were evaluated for their ability to direct RNase H cleavage of the target mRNA in vitro, to affect target affinity, and to modulate antisense activity against the Ha-ras message in cells (28Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Google Scholar). In that report, it was demonstrated that antisense activity can be significantly enhanced through the use of certain 2′-sugar modifications that hybridize to complementary RNA with a relatively high affinity, relative to unmodified DNA, provided that the oligonucleotide is designed as a chimera in which the 2′-sugar-modified region of the oligonucleotide, which is unable to activate RNase H, is fused to an RNase H-sensitive deoxy gap region of the appropriate length. We now describe a systematic study in which modified chimeric oligonucleotides were characterized for both their relative susceptibility to degradation by purified nucleases in vitro and their ability to elicit antisense effects in cells. The antisense target for these studies was again the Ha-ras oncogene containing a GGC → GTC point mutation at codon 12 (27Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Google Scholar). Our results indicate that replacement of as few as three phosphorothioate linkages with phosphodiester linkages in an oligonucleotide greatly compromises both nuclease resistance and antisense activity and that substantial nuclease resistance, sufficient for obtaining antisense activity in cells, can be conferred to phosphodiester oligonucleotides through the use of appropriate 2′-alkoxy modifications. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the antisense activity observed for oligonucleotides that exhibit partial resistance to nucleolytic degradation is dependent on both the employed oligonucleotide concentration as well as the duration of oligonucleotide treatment.

T24 cells were grown in McCoy's 5a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Synthesis of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester oligonucleotides (deoxy and 2′-modified) were performed using an Applied Biosystems 380B automated DNA synthesizer as described previously (27Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Google Scholar). Purification of oligonucleotide products was also as described previously (27Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Google Scholar). Purified oligonucleotide products were greater than 90% full-length material as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and desalted using Poly Pak cartridges (Glen Research, Sterling, VA). Labeling was carried out using [γ32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. After the labeling reaction, the samples were heated at 95°C for 2 min to inactivate the T4 polynucleotide kinase for snake venom phosphodiesterase assays. Nuclease stability of the oligonucleotides was assayed at 0.1 µM oligonucleotide using 5 × 10−3 units/ml snake venom phosphodiesterase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) in a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 72 mM CaCl, and 14 mM MgCl2 in a final volume of 50 µl. For Bal31 nuclease assays, nuclease stabilities of the oligonucleotides were assayed at 0.1 µM oligonucleotide using 2 × 10−3 units/ml Bal31 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA (final volume = 100 µl). For both nuclease assays, 5-µl reaction aliquots were removed at the indicated times, added to an equal volume of 80% formamide containing bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol gel tracking dyes, and then heated for 2 min at 95°C. Aliquots were then stored at −20°C until analysis by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Quantitation was performed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). T24 cells growing in 10-cm plates at a density of 50–75% confluency were used for oligonucleotide treatments and mRNA analysis. Cells were washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline, prewarmed to 37°C, and Opti-MEM containing 5 µg/ml DOTMA:DOPE solution for 100 nM oligonucleotide treatments or 12.5 µg/ml DOTMA:DOPE solution for 1 µM oligonucleotide treatments was added to each plate (5 ml/plate). Oligonucleotides were added from 200 µM stocks to each plate and incubated 4 h at 37°C. Following treatment, medium was removed and replaced with prewarmed McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated 37°C. Total RNA was prepared from cells by the guanidinium isothyiocyanate procedure (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar) 24–72 h (as indicated under “Results”) following initiation of oligonucleotide treatment. Total RNA was isolated by centrifugation of the cell lysates over a cesium chloride cushion (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). RNA samples were electrophoresed through 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Zeta-Probe hybridization membranes (Bio-Rad) by capillary diffusion over a 12–14-h period. The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to ultraviolet light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) and hybridized to random-primed 32P-labeled full-length cDNA probes corresponding to human Ha-ras or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. RNA was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager as described previously (34Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Google Scholar). In previous reports, oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (P=S) of varying lengths were tested for antisense activity and selectivity for Ha-ras mRNA containing a G → T transversion at codon 12 (27Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Google Scholar, 28Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Google Scholar). In those reports, antisense activity was shown to correlate directly with relative affinity of an oligonucleotide for its RNA target and on the ability of the oligonucleotide to activate RNase H cleavage in vitro using HeLa cell extracts (22Sproat B.S. Lamond A.I. Beijer B. Neuner P. Ryder U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3373-3386Google Scholar, 23Iribarren A.M. Sproat B.S. Neuner P. Sulston I. Ryder V. Lamond A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7747-7751Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide that conferred the greatest mutant selectivity in those reports was a 17-mer, the sequence of which is shown in Fig. 1. Based on the sequence of the mutant selective 17-mer oligonucleotide, a series of chimeric P=S oligonucleotides were synthesized that contain between 1 and 10 centered phosphodiester (P=O) linkages. These oligonucleotides, along with a nonchimeric P=S 17-mer and a uniform P=O 17-mer, are shown in Fig. 1. These compounds were characterized for endonuclease sensitivity in vitro using Bal31 endonuclease (Fig. 2). The uniform P=S and the chimera containing a single P=O linkage (oligos 1 and 2) were both totally resistant to endonuclease degradation. Additionally, nuclease sensitivity correlated directly with the number of P=O linkages (“P=O content”) for chimeras containing 2 or more P=O linkages. The greatest increase in nuclease sensitivity occurred when P=O content was increased from three linkages to four (oligos 4 and 5, respectively). Finally, all of the chimeras were less sensitive to nuclease degradation as compared with the uniform P=O oligonucleotide, with the exception of oligo 7 which contains 10 consecutive P=O linkages. To determine the ability of P=S/P=O chimeric oligonucleotides to elicit antisense effects in cells, Ha-ras transformed T24 cells were treated in culture with oligonucleotides 1–8 (Fig. 1) at a final oligonucleotide concentration of either 0.1 µM or 1.0 µM and antisense activity was assessed by analysis of Ha-ras mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 3, oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of Ha-ras mRNA expression was dose-dependent. At the high dose (1.0 µM), complete inhibition of Ha-ras mRNA expression was observed for oligonucleotides 1–6 (Fig. 3C). However, at the low dose (0.1 µM), the relative antisense activity between oligonucleotides containing different amounts of P=O linkages could be readily distinguished. Chimeras containing one or two P=O linkages displayed activity equal to that of the parent uniform P=S. However, as P=O content was increased beyond two linkages, antisense activity gradually decreased. Antisense activity was not observed at either dose for the chimera containing 10 consecutive P=O linkages (oligo 7) nor with the uniform phosphodiester (oligo 8). The kinetics of antisense inhibition of Ha-ras mRNA was also determined for the P= S/P=O chimeric oligonucleotide series (Fig. 4). In this analysis, T24 cells were treated with a relatively low concentration of antisense oligonucleotide (0.1 µM) and Ha-ras mRNA levels were determined at 4, 10, and 24 h following initiation of oligonucleotide treatment. The degree of antisense activity induced by the chimeric oligonucleotides was found to be highly time-dependent (Fig. 4). Oligonucleotides containing 0, 1, or 2 P=O linkages all displayed the greatest activity, which was equal and maintained throughout the analysis (up to 24 h). Oligonucleotides containing 3–5 consecutive P=O linkages displayed good to moderate activity at the early time point (4 h) but substantially diminished activity over time. This loss in activity over time for oligonucleotides 4–6 correlated well with the loss of intact oligonucleotide over time in these cells as determined by capillary gel electrophoresis. 2B. P. Monia, unpublished experiments. Oligonucleotide 7, which contains 10 consecutive P=O linkages, as well as oligonucleotide 10, which contains eight alternating P=O linkages, displayed no significant antisense activity at any time following oligonucleotide administration. A series of 2′-alkoxy and 2′-fluoro, sugar-modified oligonucleotides were analyzed for their ability to confer both resistance to snake venom phosphodiesterase exonuclease activity in vitro and antisense activity against Ha-ras in intact cells. Since these modifications have been reported to be unable to support RNase H cleavage in vitro (28Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Google Scholar), and since three or more consecutive deoxy/P=O linkages greatly compromises the antisense activity observed in cells (Figs. 2, 3, 4), the Ha-ras mutant-selective 17-mer test sequence was designed as a chimera containing 2′-sugar-modified/P=O regions flanking a centered deoxy/P=S “gap” that is of sufficient length to support RNase H activity in vitro and antisense activity in cells (28Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Google Scholar). In addition, oligonucleotides of identical design but containing a uniform P=S backbone were synthesized and tested for comparative antisense activity. The sugar modifications included in this series were methoxy, propoxy, pentoxy, and fluoro. These modifications have previously been reported to markedly affect affinity for a complementary RNA sequence with a rank order (high to low affinity) fluoro > methoxy > propoxy > pentoxy = deoxy (28Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Google Scholar). The design of these chimeric oligonucleotides along with the chemical structures of the sugar modifications examined in this study are illustrated in Fig. 5. Significant exonuclease resistance, relative to the unmodified deoxy/P=O chimera, was observed for all of the 2′-alkoxy-modified oligonucleotides (Fig. 6). However, the degree of resistance conferred by a given 2′-alkoxy modification was dependent on the length of the alkoxy chain. The pentoxy modification clearly conferred the greatest exonuclease resistance, displaying stability to degradation equal to that of the uniform deoxy/phosphorothioate (t1/2 > 5 h). The 2′-propoxy chimera displayed resistance dramatically less than that of the pentoxy chimera but slightly better than that displayed by the methoxy chimera (propoxy t1/2 = 60 min; methoxy t1/2 = 30 min). The 2′-fluoro-modified chimera displayed no enhanced exonuclease resistance, as compared with the unmodified deoxy/P=O chimera (t1/2 < 5 min). The results described above indicate that the rank order resistance to exonucleolytic degradation conferred by the 2′-sugar modifications tested in this study are pentoxy > propoxy > methoxy > fluoro = deoxy. To determine whether these in vitro results correlate with antisense activity in intact cells, these same oligonucleotides were tested for inhibition of Ha-ras mRNA expression at two doses (0.1 µM and 1.0 µM). As shown in Fig. 7, antisense activity of the 2′-modified chimeric series was dose-dependent. As previously reported (28Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Google Scholar), all of the chimeras containing a uniform P=S backbone displayed potent activity at both low and high oligonucleotide concentrations. However, the level of activity achieved for these chimeras differed, depending on the particular modification, with the most potent modification in the uniform P=S backbone being the 2′-fluoro followed by the 2′-methoxy and 2′-propoxy. The 2′-pentoxy chimera displayed activity equal to that of the parent deoxy P=S oligonucleotide. This rank order potency for these 2′-modified chimeras (fluoro > methoxy > propoxy > pentoxy = deoxy) correlates directly with the affinity of these molecules for their complementary RNA sequence (28Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Google Scholar). The relative activity of chimeras containing 2′-modifications in a P=O backbone was markedly different from that of the uniform P=S 2′-modified chimeras (Fig. 7). In this case, activity did not correlate with relative affinity for the complementary RNA sequence but instead correlated with the snake venom phosphodiesterase exonuclease resistance conferred by the particular 2′-modification (Fig. 6). The exonuclease-resistant 2′-alkoxy-modified chimeras all displayed dose-dependent activity. However, the most active oligos in this series contained 2′-pentoxy or 2′-propoxy modifications. The 2′-methoxy chimeras displayed intermediate activity, and the 2′-fluoro and unmodified deoxy chimeras displayed no antisense activity at either of the employed concentrations. The kinetics of antisense inhibition of Ha-ras mRNA expression by the 2′-modified P=S/P=O chimeras was also examined in T24 cells treated with low oligonucleotide doses (0.1 µM), (Fig. 8). Duration of antisense activity for a particular 2′-modified oligonucleotide correlated directly with the relative resistance to snake venom phosphodiesterase-mediated exonuclease degradation in vitro (Fig. 5). For example, at 4 h following oligonucleotide treatment, the extent of activity for pentoxy, propoxy, and methoxy chimeras was virtually indistinguishable. However, at 48 h following initiation of oligonucleotide treatment, a clear rank order activity was apparent (pentoxy > propoxy > methoxy). At no time point did the 2′-fluoro-modified P=S/P=O chimera or the unmodified (deoxy) P=S/P=O chimera display significant activity. These results demonstrate that, in a P=O backbone, relative activity of a modified oligonucleotide is strongly dependent on the degree of nuclease stability conferred by oligonucleotide modifications regardless of relative affinity for the target mRNA. We have previously identified a 17-mer phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the Ha-ras codon 12 point mutation (GGC → GTC), which displays point mutation specificity for mutated forms of Ha-ras (27Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Google Scholar). We have also shown previously that incorporation of high affinity 2′-sugar modifications within this uniform phosphorothioate oligonucleotide increases antisense potency up to 15-fold in a manner that correlates directly with increased target affinity conferred by the particular 2′-sugar modification (28Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Google Scholar). In that study, relative nuclease stability of the modified oligonucleotides did not contribute significantly to relative antisense activity, since activity was assessed at short times following oligonucleotide treatment and the oligonucleotides were synthesized as stable uniform phosphorothioates. In this report, we have used this 17-mer sequence to test the effects of replacing P=S backbone linkages with P=O linkages on both nuclease stability in vitro and antisense activity in cells. We also determined the relative stability of oligonucleotides containing various 2′-sugar modifications against nuclease degradation in vitro and their relative activity for inhibiting target gene expression in cells. Our results demonstrate a clear correlation between the in vitro nuclease stability and antisense activity of the tested modified oligonucleotides. Replacement of P=S linkages with P=O linkages was found to greatly reduce both stability toward nucleases in vitro and antisense activity in cells. Furthermore, a direct correlation was observed between the number of P=O linkages introduced into an oligonucleotide (“P=O content”) and nuclease sensitivity. However, reduced antisense activity resulting from the introduction of P=O linkages was overcome to some extent through the utilization of higher oligonucleotide concentrations or by examining antisense effects at shorter time periods following the initiation of oligonucleotide treatment. In agreement with a previous report (24Cummins L.L. Owens S.R. Risen L.M. Lesnik E.A. Freier S.M. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Cook P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2019-2024Google Scholar), 2′-alkoxy modifications introduced into a P=O backbone were found to increase stability toward snake venom phosphodiesterase in a manner that correlated directly with 2′-alkoxy chain length. 2′-pentoxy modifications were found to be the most stabilizing sugar modifications examined in this study. This modification, when tested in a P=O backbone, displayed stability toward exonucleolytic cleavage in vitro and antisense activity in cells equal to that of a uniform deoxy/P=S oligonucleotide of the same sequence. 2′-propoxy/P=O and 2′-methoxy/P=O oligonucleotides were also found to confer significant nuclease resistance relative to a deoxy/P=O oligonucleotide. As was the case for the 2′-pentoxy/P=O modifications, these 2′-alkoxy P=O modified oligonucleotides also elicited significant antisense effects in cells that were both dose- and time-dependent and in a manner that correlated with relative stability against nucleolytic degradation in vitro. A 2′-fluoro/P=O modified oligonucleotide displayed sensitivity toward snake venom phosphodiesterase equal to that of the unmodified deoxyphosphodiester oligonucleotide and was completely ineffective as an antisense agent in cells. These results demonstrate that appropriate 2′-sugar oligonucleotide modifications are attractive alternatives for the design of effective nuclease-stable antisense molecules with reduced phosphorothioate content. All of the 2′-sugar modifications described above were also tested as chimeras having a uniform P=S backbone for antisense activity in cells. As we have previously reported (28Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Google Scholar), all of the 2′-sugar-modified P=S chimeras displayed potent antisense activity in cells. However, the level of activity achieved for these chimeras differed, depending on relative affinity for their target RNA and not on relative nuclease resistance (relative affinity = fluoro > methoxy > propoxy > pentoxy = deoxy). Thus, for 2′-modified/P=O oligonucleotides, antisense potency is most dependent on the degree of nuclease stability conferred by the particular 2′-sugar modification. However, for oligonucleotides stabilized by uniform P=S incorporation, additional nuclease sensitivity is not an important determinant of antisense activity when tested up to 48 h following oligonucleotide treatment. Under these conditions, antisense activity is primarily determined by the relative affinity of the oligonucleotide for its target RNA, which is conferred by a particular 2′-sugar modification. In addition to the studies described above, we have also examined the nuclease sensitivity and antisense activity of 2′-modified chimeras in uniform P=S backbones over very long periods of time following oligonucleotide treatment (>60 h). In these studies, we have observed that combination of nuclease-resistant sugar modifications and nuclease-resistant backbone modifications yields antisense molecules possessing levels of nuclease resistance far greater than that of simple P=S oligonucleotides.2 These findings suggest that when the level of nuclease resistance required for a particular oligonucleotide application is even greater than that conferred by phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides, combinations of nuclease-resistant backbone modifications with nuclease-resistant sugar modifications may be the design of choice. Such an application has been suggested by Agrawal and colleagues (35Agrawal S. Temsamani J. Tang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7595-7599Google Scholar, 36Agrawal S. Zhang X. Lu Z.

Pharmacol. 1995; 56: 571-576Google Scholar), who demonstrated oral bioavailability in rodents with a 2′-methoxy chimeric phosphorothioate. The study reported here suggests that utilization of other 2′-modifications that display even greater nuclease resistance than 2′-methoxy (e.g. propoxy and pentoxy), when incorporated into a P=S backbone, may yield oligonucleotides with even greater bioavailability than 2′-methoxy chimeric P=S oligonucleotides. Studies examining these and other pharmacokinetic parameters for 2′-modified antisense oligonucleotides are in progress.

Stimulation of PLD activity by Rho-family proteins often requires prior removal of endogenous Rho from membrane preparations by RhoGDI (10Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J.

Although many experiments have indicated the involvement of Rho family proteins in GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity in vitro, their involvement in receptor-mediated activation of PLD in vivo has not been well documented. Fibroblasts provide a useful model system in which to explore mechanisms of signal transduction from the plasma membrane. Manipulation of the activity of cellular Rho has been demonstrated using the C3 exoenzyme of Clostridium botulinum which catalyzes an ADP-ribosyltransferase reaction. Modification of Rho by this enzyme interferes with its biological effects including actin stress fiber formation (18Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3716) Google Scholar, 24Morii N. Teru-uchi T. Tominaga T. Kumagai N. Kozaki S. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

In addition to causing ADP-ribosylation of Rho, the treatment led to a loss of RhoA from cells. More importantly, an inhibition of agonist- and phorbol ester-stimulated PLD activity was observed. These observations support the idea that Rho proteins are mediators of agonist-stimulated PLD activity and that protein kinase C-mediated activation of PLD may also involve Rho proteins. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was from Avanti Polar Lipids, endothelin-1 (ET-1) from Calbiochem, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) from Sigma. BODIPY 558/568 phalloidin was from Molecular Probes and SDS-polyacrylamide gels from NOVEX. Anti-RhoA antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and C3 exoenzyme from List Biologicals. [3H]Myristic acid and [3H]inositol were from DuPont NEN. Rat1 fibroblasts or rat1 fibroblasts transfected with a vector conferring puromycin resistance (pBabepuro) were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin (5 units/ml) and streptomycin (5 µg/ml). Rat1 fibroblasts growing on 100-mm dishes in serum-containing medium were washed in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 2 ml of scraping buffer (114 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl). Scraping buffer (0.5 ml) was then added in the presence or absence of C3 transferase (5 µg/ml). Cells were gently scraped (26McNeil P.L. Murphy R.F. Lanni F. Taylor D.L. J.

Confluent dishes were routinely used for scraping and gave the best viability. An estimated >90% of viable cells incorporated large molecules as determined by scrape-loading fluorescent Mr 70,000 dextrans. Scrape-loaded cells were serum-starved and labeled with [3H]myristic acid (1 µCi/ml) overnight (28Yeo E.-J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Unincorporated [3H]myristic acid was removed by washing with DMEM, and cells were incubated in DMEM for 50 min at 37°C followed by incubation in 0.3% 1-butanol for 10 min. Cells were stimulated with the indicated concentration of agonist for 20 min at 37°C, or as indicated. The reaction was terminated by washing in PBS and addition of 1.2 ml of ice-cold methanol. Cells were scraped into 1.2 ml of CHCl3 and 1.2 ml of H2O and extracted overnight. Phosphatidylbutanol, the transphosphatidylation reaction product of PLD in the presence of butanol, was separated as described previously (10Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), localized with a BioScan 200 Imaging Scanner, scraped from the plate, and quantified by scintillation counting. Cells were scrape-loaded, in the absence or presence of C3 transferase as described, into six-well plates, serum-deprived in inositol-free DMEM, and labeled with 1 µCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 18 h. Unincorporated myo-[3H]inositol was removed by washing in DMEM followed by incubation for 10 min in DMEM containing 20 mM LiCl. Cells were stimulated with LPA (100 µM) or ET-1 (100 nM) for 20 min at 37°C. Reactions were stopped with 750 µl of 20 mM formic acid, incubated on ice for 30 min, and neutralized with 100 µl of 0.7 M NaOH. Cells were scraped into Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was applied to Dowex AG1-8x columns in a modification of Berridge et al. (29Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). myo-[3H]Inositol-labeled metabolites were eluted consecutively with 4 ml of H2O to isolate free inositol ([3H]inositol fraction), 4 ml of 40 mM ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid, and 5 ml of 1 M ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid to isolate inositol phosphates ([3H]IP fraction). PLC activity was calculated from the ratio [3H]IP/([3H]inositol + [3H]IP) and converted to fold-stimulation of activity in control-scraped cells in the absence of agonists. Scrape-loaded cells were grown on glass coverslips, serum-deprived for 18 h, washed in DMEM, and incubated for 50 min before addition of 100 µM LPA for 5 min. After washing in PBS, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated with BODIPY 558/568 phalloidin for 30 min as described by Molecular Probes, Inc. Coverslips were washed, air-dried, and mounted on slides with clear nail polish. Fluorescence was observed with a 100 × objective using a Leica DMRB microscope. Cells growing in 100-mm dishes were serum-starved in DMEM for 18 h and stimulated in the absence or presence of LPA (100 µM) for 2 min, washed in PBS, and scraped into 1.0 ml of PBS that included protease inhibitors (10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml antipain, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were lysed by 6 passes through a 25-gauge needle (30Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3467) Google Scholar). Examination of lysates indicated >95% disruption of the plasma membrane by trypan blue staining. Suspensions were centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 45 min. The resulting cytosolic and particulate fractions were suspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer and examined for RhoA content by Western blotting. Cells were washed in PBS and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and protein concentrations were determined by BCA (Pierce). Equal amounts of cellular or cell fraction proteins (0.3-0.5 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 14% gel, transferred to Immobilon-P, blocked in 10% non-fat dry milk, and detected using the specified antibody, as described previously (10Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the role of Rho proteins in agonist activation of PLD, rat1 fibroblasts were stimulated with LPA, an agonist that acts via a G protein-coupled receptor (31van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 32Plevin R. MacNulty E.E. Palmer S. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). LPA has been shown to stimulate the activity of Rho in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, but not that of other members of the Rho family (17Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 18Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3716) Google Scholar). LPA stimulated a dose-dependent increase in PLD activity in serum-starved rat1 cells, as measured by production of PtdBut, with an EC50 of approximately 1 µM (Fig. 1A). PLD activation by LPA was rapid, but transient, with maximal PtdBut formation being attained at 2 min (Fig. 1B). In agreement with findings in Swiss 3T3 cells (17Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 18Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3716) Google Scholar), LPA stimulated the formation of actin stress fibers (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Actin polymerization and cell morphology are altered by C3 transferase. Cells were scraped in the absence (A and B) or presence (C and D) of 5 µg/ml C3 transferase. Serum-starved cells were stimulated for 5 min with 100 µM LPA (B and D) or a bovine serum albumin solution (A and C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We investigated the involvement of Rho in agonist-stimulated PLD activation using C3 transferase. Cells scrape-loaded with C3 transferase showed striking morphological differences to control-scraped cells, characterized by spindle formation and rounding of the cell body (Fig. 2, C and D). Control-scraped cells responded normally to agonist stimulation. PLD activity was enhanced 18-, 22-, and 42-fold by LPA, ET-1, and PMA, respectively (Fig. 3). In contrast, in C3-treated cells, PLD activation by these agents was inhibited by 63-65% (Fig. 3). Treatment of cells with C3 transferase did not significantly alter the time course of PtdBut formation by LPA (Fig. 1B), i.e. PtdBut formation was inhibited at all time points measured. Therefore, C3 treatment did not act to slow the PLD response to LPA or alter the metabolism of PtdBut. Analysis of the LPA dose-response curves on PLD activity indicated that C3 transferase did not act at the level of the LPA receptor. Whereas the extent of PLD activity was inhibited by C3 transferase, the efficacy of LPA changed very little since the EC50 values were 1.0 and 0.5 µM in control- and C3-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 1A). In addition, the activation of PI-PLC by LPA or ET-1 in scraped cells was not significantly altered by C3 treatment (Fig. 4). The formation of membrane ruffles by platelet-derived growth factor was also unaffected in C3-treated cells (data not shown). The effects of C3 transferase on levels of RhoA protein were studied by Western blot analysis. Surprisingly, treatment of cells with C3 resulted in a greater than 80% loss of immunodetectable RhoA (Fig. 5). This was not due to an inability of the RhoA antibody to detect modified RhoA since other studies have shown that C3-induced ADP-ribosylation does not alter the detection of recombinant RhoA by the antibodies used in our study (33Aktories K. Just I. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The known role of Rho in actin polymerization prompted us to investigate the role of the cytoskeleton in agonist-mediated PLD activity (17Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 18Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3716) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with cytochalasin D leads to a breakdown of cytoskeletal structure and disruption of actin filament formation. Treatment of rat1 cells with cytochalasin D (2 µM) had only a small (23%) inhibitory effect on LPA-stimulated PLD activity (Fig. 6). As expected, the cellular network of polymerized actin was obscured by this treatment (data not shown). The site of action of Rho on PLD is likely to be at a cellular membrane(s). However, much of the cellular Rho is contained in the cytosol in association with RhoGDI (34Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the effects of LPA on the cellular localization of RhoA. Treatment of cells with LPA for 2 min caused a relocalization of RhoA from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction (Fig. 7). The effect was transient, however, since no accumulation of RhoA in the particulate fraction was observable at 5 min (data not shown). The present data using the C3 transferase of C. botulinum indicate that Rho proteins play a role in agonist-stimulated PLD activity in rat1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The C3 transferase has been useful in elucidating Rho-mediated events, but the inability to readily incorporate it into a population of cells has limited studies of the cellular function of Rho proteins. The technique of scrape-loading successfully incorporates macromolecules into adherent cells (26McNeil P.L. Murphy R.F. Lanni F. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and has been used in studies of oncogenic Ras (27Roden R.B.S. Shachar-Hill Y. Cosulich S.C. Hesketh T.R. Metcalfe J.C. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 957-964PubMed Google Scholar, 35Price B.D. Morris J.D.H. Marshall C.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16638-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present findings indicate its feasibility to investigate the role of Rho proteins in the regulation of PLD and other activities in cell populations. The incorporation and function of C3 in scrape-loaded cells was confirmed by (i) morphological changes in C3-treated cells (Fig. 2) and (ii) decreased incorporation of [32P]NAD in extracts of cells previously treated with C3 transferase (data not shown). Interestingly, the loss of labeling by [32P]NAD was due not only to the incorporation of endogenous NAD but mainly to a decrease in the amount of immunoreactive RhoA. Since recombinant RhoA and RhoA modified by ADP-ribosylation are recognized equally by the antibody (33Aktories K. Just I. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the decrease represents a loss of protein. Furthermore, ADP-ribosylation of recombinant RhoA and RhoA in C3-treated cells is often accompanied by an upward gel shift (10Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Dillon S.T. Rubin E.J. Yakubovich M. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Feig L.A. Gilbert R.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this was seen in some cases in the present study. It is not known by what mechanism ADP-ribosylation of RhoA leads to its net degradation. Recently, Dillon et al. (36Dillon S.T. Rubin E.J. Yakubovich M. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Feig L.A. Gilbert R.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated a similar degradation of RhoA in C. difficile toxin B-treated fibroblasts. Therefore, modification of RhoA by these agents may be a general destabilizing signal. Loss of RhoA in C3-treated cells corresponded to the inhibition of agonist- and PMA-stimulated PLD activity. Based on the lack of inhibition of both agonist-stimulated PI-PLC activity (Fig. 4) and platelet-derived growth factor-induced membrane ruffling, the inhibition of PLD activity appears selective. In addition, LPA dose-response curves on PLD activity showed little change in EC50 values (Fig. 1A). These observations indicate that receptor function is not impaired. Together, our data suggest a role for Rho proteins in agonist-stimulated PLD activation in vivo. Very recently, Schmidt et al. (37Schmidt M. Rumenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2422-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) used a similar approach using Clostridium difficile toxin B to conclude also that Rho proteins are involved in the PLD response to agonists. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins occurs in response to LPA (38Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the regulation of PLD activity (40Dubyak G.R. Schomisch S.J. Kusner D.J. Xie M. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 41Inoue H. Shimooku K. Akisue T. Nakamura S.-I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C3-treated Swiss 3T3 cells have an impaired ability to phosphorylate proteins on tyrosine in response to LPA (39Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of Rho-dependent LPA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in C3-treated cells may explain our results. However, efforts to inhibit PLD activity to the same extent as in C3-treated cells were unsuccessful using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (data not shown) or cytochalasin D, which also inhibits agonist-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Cytochalasin B, a compound of similar specificity to that of cytochalasin D, had no effect also on receptor-stimulated PLD activity in HEK cells (37Schmidt M. Rumenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2422-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recently, Rho-dependent serine/threonine kinases have been identified, and these could be involved in PLD activation in vivo (43Kumagai N. Morii N. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 44Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). PMA-stimulated PLD activity was also inhibited in C3-treated cells (Fig. 3) indicating that Rho proteins act in a pathway involving PKC in rat1 fibroblasts. Recent studies indicate a functional interaction between RhoA and PKC (47Ohguchi K. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, a significant component of the PMA effect was not affected by C3 transferase, and little or no inhibition of PMA-stimulated PLD activity was observed in C. difficile toxin B-treated HEK cells (37Schmidt M. Rumenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2422-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results highlight the complexity of regulation of PLD activity in various tissues and cell types, perhaps reflecting differences in the distribution of different PLD and PKC isozymes and of accessory proteins that modulate the effects of Rho and ARF on PLD (48Lambeth J.D. Kwak J.-Y. Bowman E.P. Perry D. Uhlinger D.J. Lopez I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2431-2434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 49Kwak J.-Y. Lopez I. Uhlinger D.J. Ryu S.H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27093-27098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of PKC on PLD is still undefined and may partly involve a nonphosphorylation mechanism (50Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We and others (9Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that C3 treatment of either recombinant RhoA or membranes does not inhibit membrane-associated PLD activity assayed in the presence of GTPγS. Thus, it is possible that C3 modification of Rho may not interfere with the interaction of Rho with PLD at the membrane but may block activation of Rho by agonists or alter the access of Rho to the site(s) at which it activates PLD. RhoA localization is changed by treatment of cells with LPA, the G protein translocates from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction (Fig. 7). Furthermore, activation of PLD and movement of RhoA to the particulate fraction both occur rapidly. Maximal PLD activation occurs within 2 min of LPA treatment and does not increase thereafter (Fig. 1B), and the shift in RhoA from the cytosol to the particulate fraction is equally rapid (Fig. 7), although its membrane association declines more rapidly (data not shown). 2A detailed study of the translocation of Rho-family proteins in response to various agonists is being conducted and will be reported elsewhere (I. Fleming, and J. H. Exton, unpublished observations). Agonist-stimulated translocation of ARF has been reported in HL-60 cells and correlates with GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity (51Houle M.G. Kahn R.A. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22795-22800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The membrane translocation of RhoA by LPA provides an attractive model for agonist-mediated activation of PLD whereby movement of RhoA to the membrane and its subsequent activation by nucleotide exchange results in activation of PLD. However, since addition of Rho-GDI or GTPγS alone to some membrane preparations induces significant changes in PLD activity (9Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Thus other factors may be involved. In summary, the loss of RhoA protein in cells treated with C3 transferase correlates with a loss of agonist-stimulated PLD activity but not PI-PLC activity. Furthermore, LPA causes a rapid redistribution of RhoA from the cytosol to the particulate fraction that coincides with the stimulation of PLD activity. These observations indicate a role for Rho proteins in agonist regulation of PLD activity in whole cells and suggest that movement of these proteins to membranes may be involved.

In this study we utilize the yeast two-hybrid system and assays of in vitro interaction to demonstrate that IRS-2 interacts directly with the IR and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor. We show that, like IRS-1, the region of IRS-2 that contains the putative phosphotyrosine binding and SAIN elements(188-591) is sufficient for receptor interaction and that this interaction is dependent upon the NPX(p)Y (where (p)Y is phosphotyrosine) motifs within the juxtamembrane domains of the receptors. In addition to this amino-terminal NPX(p)Y-binding domain, an additional domain of strong interaction was identified in the central region of IRS-2 and was localized between amino acids 591 and 733. This interaction was found to be dependent upon receptor phosphorylation but was NPX(p)Y-independent. This region does not appear to have either an SH2 or a phosphotyrosine binding domain. Both of the interactions could also be demonstrated in vitro using IRS-2 glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We conclude that IRS-2, unlike IRS-1, can interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors such as the IR and insulin-like growth factor I receptor via multiple independent binding motifs. Our findings suggest the existence of a previously unidentified phosphotyrosine-dependent binding domain within the central region of IRS-2.

Recently, mice have been generated in which the IRS-1 gene has been disrupted by homologous recombination. Surprisingly these mice were found to have only a slight insulin-resistant phenotype(20.Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.-E. Bruning J.C. Haag B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R.

Muscle and adipose tissue from these mice were found to express an alternative ∼190-kDa substrate which, like IRS-1, could interact with and activate PI 3-kinase in an insulin-dependent manner. Recently, a protein that possesses similar characteristics to IRS-1 was cloned(22.Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G.J. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). This molecule was first identified as a protein that was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to interleukin 4 stimulation and was initially termed 4PS(23.Wang L.M. Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Heideran M.E. Gutkind J.S. Pierce J.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4899-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The 4PS protein was shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in myeloid progenitor cells in response to interleukin 4 and insulin and to interact with and activate PI 3-kinase (24.Wang L.-M. Myers M.G.

Using the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase as an affinity matrix, the 4PS protein was purified from FDC-P2 cells and its cDNA was isolated(22.Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G.J. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that 4PS possessed extensive homology with IRS-1, and it was therefore redesignated as IRS-2. Reconstitution experiments have confirmed that IRS-2 is a substrate of the IR and that it associates with PI 3-kinase and Grb2(26.Patti M.E. Sun X.-J. Bruening J.C. Araki E. Lipes M.A. White M.F.

We have recently characterized the interactions of the IR and IGFIR with IRS-1 and SHC using the yeast two-hybrid system and other assays of protein-protein interaction(27.Craparo A. O'Neill T.J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The interactions of IRS-1 and SHC with the IR were found to be phosphotyrosine-dependent and also to require an intact NPX(p)Y motif within the juxtamembrane domains of the IR and IGFIR. We have localized the region within IRS-1 that is involved in interaction with the IR and IGFIR to the amino terminus of IRS-1 between amino acids 160 and 516(30.O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Further deletions within this region suggested the presence of an essential region at the amino-terminal end of this domain, since deletion of amino acids 160-174 totally eliminated interaction(27.Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This essential region was subsequently shown to be the most highly conserved region within the IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins and has been suggested to contain a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) motif(22.Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G.J. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Although it is not yet clear whether this region contains a true PTB domain, these findings nevertheless support our previous identification of this region as an essential element of interaction(27.Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30.O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We initially termed the region just downstream of the potential PTB domain the SAIN domain (for SHC and IRS-1 NPXY binding) on the basis of a limited homology to the SHC PTB domain(28.Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This region appears to be important for high level interaction yet is not essential for the interaction(27.Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28.Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell.

Since our data clearly show that the SAIN elements in IRS-1 (and IRS-2, see below) are important for interaction but do not appear to contain the core binding element, the mechanism by which this domain enhances the interaction with the IR and IGFIR is currently unclear. In this study, we characterize the interaction of IRS-2 with the IR and IGFIR. We demonstrate that IRS-2 interacts with the IR via two discrete domains, the first interacting in an NPX(p)Y-dependent manner very similar to IRS-1 via an amino-terminal domain within IRS-2. We also identify a second receptor interaction domain located between 591 and 733 of IRS-2, which interacts in a phosphotyrosine-dependent but NPX(p)Y-independent manner, unlike IRS-1.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 194: 1-774Google Scholar). Plasmid transformation of yeast was either by the lithium acetate method (35.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr.

The IR, IGFIR, and IRS-1 two-hybrid fusions have been previously reported(27.Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

All site-directed mutants were generated using the method of Kunkel (37.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) using customized primers. The IRS-2 constructs were produced by standard methods, and detailed cloning strategies are available upon request. The solution β-galactosidase assays were performed as described(38.Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and the units of β-galactosidase activity were calculated by the method of Miller (39.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The values shown for the positive colonies represent the average of 3-10 assays (each assay representing an independent colony). Assays were performed on at least three different days to ensure the reliability of the data, and the values obtained varied ∼10% from day to day. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the significance of the activities of each receptor mutant in Fig. 3B. Specifically the units of activity were compared by one-way analysis of variance, and significance levels were determined using the Newman-Keuls test. GST fusion proteins were generated with various regions of IRS-1 and IRS-2 using the pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or pGSTag (40.Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar) vectors. All GST fusions were expressed in DH5α bacterial cells and purified onto glutathione-agarose beads using standard techniques(41.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.S. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The beads that contained immobilized fusion protein were then incubated with cell lysates derived from CHO.T cells (which overexpress the IR) prior to or after insulin stimulation (10 min, 100 nM). Lysates were prepared by lysis for 30 min on ice in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin followed by spinning at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material. The resulting supernatants were incubated with the immobilized GST proteins for 4 h. After extensive washing with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, the proteins that coprecipitated with the IRS-1, IRS-2, or control GST proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with either anti-IR (IR-CT1) (a gift from Ken Siddle) or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20) (Transduction Labs). To investigate whether IRS-2 interacts directly with the IR and IGFIR, we initially utilized the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown schematically in Fig. 1A, we utilized full-length and various subdomains of IRS-2 to generate activation domain hybrids. These hybrid proteins were assayed for interaction with the cytoplasmic domains of either the IR or IGFIR, which were expressed as DNA binding hybrids. As we have previously shown, these receptor hybrids are kinase active and autophosphorylate properly(27.Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30.O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 1B, coexpression of an essentially full-length (amino acids 3-1321) IRS-2 hybrid with either the IR or IGFIR resulted in very high activity in the two-hybrid assay as measured by either the colony color assay or the solution assay for β-galactosidase activity (300-500 units). To delineate the region(s) of IRS-2 that interacted with the IR and IGFIR hybrids, we produced 11 activation domain hybrid proteins containing various regions of IRS-2. When we expressed either the amino- (amino acids 3-591) or carboxyl- (amino acids 591-1321) terminal halves of IRS-2 as fusions, both gave significant activity (Fig. 1B). This suggested that IRS-2, unlike IRS-1, contained two domains capable of independently interacting with the IR and IGFIR. We first focused on the amino-terminal receptor interaction domain that we term RBD1 for receptor-binding domain 1. As shown in Fig. 1B, expression of 10 IRS-2 hybrid proteins within this region provided evidence that the minimal domain possessing full activity was located between amino acids 188 and 591. Deletion of the carboxyl portion of this fragment to amino acid 429 or 326 reduced activity by at least 70%, and further deletion to amino acid 263 eliminated all activity. Amino-terminal deletion of amino acids 188-214 within the 188-591 fragment totally eliminated activity. We conclude that the amino-terminal subdomain within RBD1 forms an essential element for interaction with the IR or IGFIR while the carboxyl portion of this domain is important but not essential for the interaction. These data are entirely consistent with our previous delineation of the IR-binding domain of IRS-1(27.Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30.O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the amino-terminal subdomain of the RBD1 is the most highly conserved region between IRS-1 and IRS-2(22.Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G.J. Glasheen E. Lane W.S.

Whether or not the IRS molecules contain regions that are structurally related to the classical PTB domain remains to be proven. To better characterize the binding activity observed within the carboxyl end (1.Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.-C. Tsubokawa M.

Nature. 1985; 33: 756-761Crossref Scopus (1526) Google Scholar) of IRS-2, we expressed nine regions of this protein and determined their activity in the two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 2, the four carboxyl-terminal deletions showed that removal of amino acids 734-1321 had no significant effect upon activity. Further deletion to amino acid 697 eliminated all activity. Amino-terminal deletions showed that removal of amino acids 591-697 or 591-732 markedly reduced activity. These data suggest that IRS-2 contains a receptor binding domain located between amino acids 591 and 733, which mediates a strong interaction with both the IR and IGFIR. To better characterize the site(s) within the IR and IGFIR that were mediating interaction with IRS-2, we expressed four IRS-2 hybrids with a number of IR and IGFIR hybrids containing specific mutations or deletions. As shown in Fig. 3A, all four IRS-2 hybrids showed significant interaction with the wild-type IR and IGFIR hybrid proteins. Conversely, none of the IRS-2 hybrids showed any interaction with either the kinase-dead IR (K1018A) 2The numbering of amino acids of the IR corresponds to the sequence of the receptor of Ullrich et al.(1.Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.-C. Tsubokawa M. Mason M. Seeburg P.H. Granfeld C. Rosen M. Ramachandran J.

This shows that interaction of IRS-2 with these receptors is kinase-dependent and that both RBD1 and RBD2 require receptor kinase activity for interaction. We next tested interaction of these IRS-2 hybrids with a number of IR and IGFIR hybrids in which specific Tyr residues had been altered. As shown in Fig. 3A, mutation of Tyr-960 within the IR or the corresponding Tyr-950 within the IGFIR eliminated interaction with the IRS-2(3-591) hybrid protein. These tyrosines are located within the NPXY motifs of the IR and IGFIR and have been previously shown to be essential for IRS-1 interaction with the receptors (28.Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 29.He W. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that the RBD1 requires an intact NPX(p)Y motif for interaction. Conversely, the same Y960F IR or Y950F IGFIR substitutions had no effect upon interaction of the IRS-2 hybrids containing the RBD2 domain. In an attempt to identify the site(s) of interaction of RBD2, we examined interaction of RBD2-containing proteins with IR mutants in which specific tyrosine residues had been altered or deleted. Mutation of Tyr-953 within the juxtamembrane domain had no effect upon interaction of any of these proteins. Likewise, expression of an IR deletion mutant in which the 30 carboxyl amino acids were removed by insertion of a stop codon (Δ30CT) had no effect upon the interaction. Thus it is unlikely that the two carboxyl-terminal tyrosines (1316 and 1322) are essential for interaction. We also tested two IR mutants that contained mutations within the “triple tyrosine” region of the kinase domain, which has been implicated in IR kinase activation. The Y1146F (FYY) IR mutant showed undiminished interaction with RBD2-containing proteins. Conversely, a Y1150F/Y1151F (YFF) double mutant showed markedly reduced activities with RBD2 in the two-hybrid assay (data not shown). However, this YFF receptor mutant has been found to have markedly reduced activities for all interacting proteins (the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, SHC, and IRS-1) and does not appear to be efficiently autophosphorylated (not shown). This finding is consistent with a previous report that examined these receptor mutants in CHO cells(45.Zhang B. Tavare J.M. Ellis L. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 990-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot conclude or rule out the possibility that the 1150 and/or 1151 tyrosines may interact with the RBD2 of IRS-2. To characterize better the interaction of the RBD1 domain of IRS-2 with the NPXY region of the IR, we expressed the IRS-2(3-591) hybrid with 17 IR hybrids that contained single or double amino acid substitutions within and surrounding the NPXY motif(29.He W. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23258-23262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, mutation of Tyr-960 to Glu eliminated the interaction with this region of IRS-2. We conclude that replacement of this tyrosine with a negatively charged amino acid is not sufficient to reconstitute this interaction. Alteration of the Asn or the Pro within the NPXY motif significantly reduced the interaction of IRS-1 with the IR, as did a double Asn and Pro replacement. Replacement of the Glu at position −1 from the Tyr had no effect upon IRS-2 interaction. These data are consistent with the idea that the RBD1 domain within IRS-2 interacts with the IR in an NPX(p)Y-dependent manner. None of the other receptor mutations had significant effects upon IRS-2 interaction, although the Leu and Tyr mutations at positions −7 and −8 showed consistently lower levels of interaction. These data are consistent with our previous findings (29.He W. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23258-23262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) regarding the interaction of IRS-1 and the IR, with a few minor exceptions. First, alteration of either the Asn or Pro residues within the NPXY motif totally eliminated IRS-1 interaction, whereas IRS-2 shows significant, though greatly reduced, interaction. Second, alteration of the Leu and Tyr residues at amino acids −7 and −8 had a much more pronounced effect upon IRS-1 interaction (∼70% reduction in activity) than we observed with IRS-2 (∼40% reduction in activity). These differences suggest that although both IRS-1 and IRS-2 require an intact NPX(p)Y motif for interaction with RBD1, subtle differences between these proteins may exist. We next investigated whether the interactions between the IR and the RBD1 and RBD2 domains of IRS-2 could be demonstrated in vitro. We produced seven GST fusions, which together encompass the entire IRS-2 coding sequence. These are shown schematically in Fig. 4A. Immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated with lysates from CHO-IR cells that were either unstimulated or stimulated with insulin (100 nM for 10 min). After extensive washing, the coprecipitating proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently immunoblotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-IR antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, both domains previously identified in the two-hybrid assay showed clear phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction with the IR in vitro. Specifically, IRS-2 RBD1 hybrids containing amino acids 3-326 or 188-591 were able to interact with the IR in vitro, whereas the 327-591-amino acid hybrid was not. Two GST hybrids containing the RBD2 sequences (amino acids 591-785 or 591-894) were also found to interact efficiently with the IR in vitro. The lack of coprecipitation observed with the 3-189 amino acids and 895-1321 amino acid constructs suggests that the PH domain and extreme carboxyl end of IRS-2 do not interact significantly with the IR. For comparison, we also produced four GST fusion proteins containing similar regions of the IRS-1 protein and assayed their ability to interact with the IR in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4B, the two GST fusions that contained the essential domain of interaction within RBD1 (amino acids 21-400 and 108-516) were efficiently coprecipitated with the IR, whereas the region of IRS-1 corresponding to RBD2 of IRS-2 showed no interaction. These data are consistent with our two-hybrid data and suggest that IRS-1 does not contain this second domain of IR interaction. This is not surprising since these regions show only minimal sequence similarity(22.Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G.J. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Our findings raise several questions regarding the role of RBD1 and RBD2 in IRS-2-mediated signaling. First, it is possible that the RBD2 domain represents a new phosphotyrosine binding domain analogous to the SH2 or PTB domains. This possibility is shown schematically in Fig. 5(Model 1). RBD2 does not appear to contain either an SH2- or a PTB-like sequence, and searches of the available data bases do not reveal significant similarity to proteins other than IRS-1-related proteins. Therefore, RBD2 binding to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences appears to represent a novel type of interaction. However, our inability to identify a specific tyrosine within the IR that mediates this interaction (except possibly tyrosines 1150 and 1151) does not allow us to make this conclusion definitively. It is also possible, for example, that IR activation exposes a region of the receptor that is masked in the unstimulated receptor and becomes exposed after insulin binding. This region of the IR may thus interact with RBD2 in a manner that is dependent upon a phosphorylation-induced conformational change but independent of a specific phosphotyrosine residue. This possibility is shown schematically in Fig. 5(Model 2). Finally, it is possible that RBD2 can interact with several phosphotyrosines. Thus, any single tyrosine mutation may not effectively eliminate the interaction. Further studies will be needed to address these possibilities. The existence of two distinct phosphotyrosine binding elements within IRS-2 is intriguing in a number of other ways. It seems likely, for example, that such a binding element should allow IRS-2 to interact with additional signaling proteins and receptors that do not contain NPX(p)Y elements thus expanding the repertoire of potential signaling partners utilized by the IRS family of proteins. Whether a receptor has one or two sites of interaction with IRS-2 may also allow for differential signal transduction, which might theoretically be mediated by differences in the stability of the interaction or differential phosphorylation of IRS-2 tyrosine residues. It is also possible that each binding element within IRS-2 may interact in vivo with distinct tyrosyl-phosphorylated substrates. It will be interesting to determine whether the differences which we have observed between IRS-1 and IRS-2 allow these highly related proteins to play distinct functional roles in vivo.

The abilities of the receptors for C5a and fMLP to activate PLC β2 and PLC β3 through the Gβγ subunits of endogenous Gi proteins in COS-7 cells were tested because both PLC β2 and PLC β3 were shown to be activated by the βγ subunits of G proteins in in vitro reconstitution assays. Neither of the receptors can activate endogenous PLC β3 or recombinant PLC β3 in transfected COS-7 cells. However, both receptors can clearly activate PLC β2 in a PTx-sensitive manner, suggesting that the receptors may interact with endogenous PTx-sensitive G proteins and activate PLC β2 probably through the Gβγ subunits. These findings were further corroborated by the results that PLC β3 could only be slightly activated by Gβ1γ1 or Gβ1γ5 in the cotransfection assay, whereas the Gβγ subunits strongly activated PLC β2 under the same conditions. PLC β3 can be activated by Gαq, Gα11, and Gα16 in the cotransfection assay. In addition, the Gγ2 and Gγ3 mutants with substitution of the C-terminal Cys residue by a Ser residue, which can inhibit wild type Gβγ-mediated activation of PLC β2, were able to inhibit C5a or fMLP-mediated activation of PLC β2. These Gγ mutants, however, showed little effect on m1-muscarinic receptor-mediated PLC activation, which is mediated by the Gq class of G proteins. These results all confirm that the Gβγ subunits are involved in PLC β2 activation by the two chemoattractant receptors and suggest that in COS-7 cells activation of PLC β3 by Gβγ may not be the primary pathway for the receptors.

These pathways can be divided into two groups based on their sensitivities to Pertussis toxin (PTx). PTx is a bacterial toxin that catalyzes ribosylation of C-terminal cysteine residues of some Gα subunits, including the Gαi subunits, Gαo subunits, and transducin α subunits. Modification by PTx prevents the interaction between Gα subunits and receptors, thus blocking ligand-mediated signal transduction (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4652) Google Scholar, 4Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The Gα subunits of the Gq and Gs class of G proteins lack the C-terminal cysteine residues; hence, signal transduction pathways mediated by these Gα subunits are PTx-resistant (3Simon M.I.

Other receptors appear to activate PLC in a PTx-sensitive manner. Typical examples are found in leukocytes, where responses to a number of chemoattractants, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), C5a, and f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), are mostly PTx-sensitive (8Gerard C.

A mechanism involved in the PTx-sensitive processes has recently been proposed; ligand-bound receptors may interact with PTx-sensitive G proteins, such as the Gi proteins, and release Gβγ, which then activates PLC. This hypothesis is based on the findings that the Gβγ subunits of G proteins can activate certain isoforms of PLC β, while the Gαi subunits cannot. The Gβγ subunits were shown to activate PLC β2 but not PLC β1 or PLC β4 in a cotransfection assay (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I.

Our previous report on reconstitution of PTx-sensitive, IL-8-induced activation of PLC β2 in cotransfected COS-7 cells supports the hypothesis that the chemokine receptor acts through Gβγ activation of the PLC β2 isoform (26Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the signal transduction pathways for the C5a and fMLP receptors, which play important roles in inflammation (8Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). C5a and fMLP receptors have previously been shown to couple selectively to PTx-insensitive Gα subunit, Gα16 to activate PLC (27Amatruda T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Amatruda T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). There must, however, also be a distinct pathway that mediates the PTx-sensitive responses to fMLP and C5a. The PTx-sensitive pathways may be the predominant ones in mature leukocytes, because responses to chemoattractants were found to be largely PTx-sensitive in these cells. Since C5a and fMLP, like IL-8, induce Ca2+ efflux and leukocyte chemotaxis that are sensitive to PTx treatment, the C5a and fMLP receptors may utilize the same signal transduction pathways as the IL-8 receptors (26Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). By using the cotransfection assay, we found that these two receptors can specifically activate PLC β2 but not PLC β3, presumably through the Gβγ subunits released from the Gi proteins. The finding that the Gγ2 and Gγ3 mutants, with substitution of the C-terminal Cys residues by Ser residues, can act as dominant negative inhibitors to block Gβγ-mediated activation of PLC β2 in cotransfected COS-7 cells supports the notion that the Gβγ subunits are involved in the signal transduction processes of these chemoattractant receptors. Cos-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum under 5% CO2 at 37°C. For transfection, Cos-7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well the day before transfection (32Wu D. Jiang H. Katz Simon M.I. J. Biol.

The media were removed the next day, and 0.25 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2 µl of lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 µg of plasmid DNA were added to each well. Five hours later the transfection media were replaced by the culture media. Then the cells were labeled with 10 µCi/ml myo[2-3H]inositol the following day, and the levels of inositol phosphates were determined 1 day later as described previously (29Wu D. Lee C-H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the cDNAs used in these studies were constructed into expression vectors that were driven by the cytomegalovirus promoters (29Wu D. Lee C-H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Western analysis of protein expression in COS-7 cells, equal numbers of cells were directly solubilized in SDS sample buffer. For analysis of Gγ expression, equal numbers of cells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EDTA for 5 min, and they were washed off the plates and collected into microcentrifuge tubes. After brief spinning, the cells were subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles in a hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) containing various protease inhibitors. Then the cytosolic and particulate fractions were separated by high-speed centrifugation. Finally the samples were solubilized in or diluted with the SDS sample buffer and loaded to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were subsequently electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and detected with antibodies indicated in the figure legends. The Gγ3CS mutant was generated by polymerase chain reaction with the high fidelity DNA polymerase, pfu (Stratagene), and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Gγ1CS and Gγ2CS mutants were kindly provided by Dr. Narasimthan Gautam from the Washington University, MO. COS-7 cells in 24-well plates were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the receptors and various proteins including PLCs, Gβ, Gγ, or β-galactosidase. Varying amounts of 125I-labeled C5a (2200 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) were incubated with the transfectants for 1 h on ice. Then the cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and solubilized in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide. Aliquots were counted in a γ-counter. The values derived from cells transfected with the β-galactosidase DNA were taken as nonspecific binding. The maximal ligand-binding sites and affinities were determined by Scatchard analysis. We used the cotransfection assay in COS-7 cells to characterize signal transduction pathways that mediate PTx-sensitive PLC activation by the receptors for C5a and fMLP. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding the C5a receptor or fMLP receptor alone showed no ligand-dependent accumulation of IPs (Fig. 1), confirming the report that the C5a and fMLP receptors do not couple to Gαq/11 (27Amatruda T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (COS-7 cells contain endogenous Gαq/11 but not Gα16 (26Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar)). However, when the cells were cotransfected with the PLC β2 cDNA and the cDNA encoding the C5a or fMLP receptor, there were marked ligand-induced increases in accumulation of IPs, and these ligand-induced responses were sensitive to PTx (Fig. 1). Cells cotransfected with the cDNA encoding PLC β1 instead did not show any ligand-induced responses (Fig. 1). Knowing that Gβγ can only activate PLC β2, but not PLC β1 in the cotransfection system, and that COS-7 cells contain PLC β1, but not PLC β2 (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 18Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we interpret this result to conclude that the receptors for C5a and fMLP may interact with endogenous PTx-sensitive G proteins, presumably Gi2 proteins, and cause release of the βγ subunits, which activate the recombinant PLC β2. We assume that the interaction is with Gi2 because only Gi2, but not other known PTx-sensitive G proteins including the Gi1, Gi3, or Go proteins, was detected in COS-7 cells (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Since COS-7 cells contain endogenous PLC β3 (18Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we predict that the C5a or fMLP receptor would induce IP accumulation by activating endogenous PLC β3 through Gβγ. However, this did not occur (Fig. 1), suggesting that the Gβγ subunits released from the endogenous Gi proteins were unable to activate the endogenous PLC β3. To investigate whether the C5a or fMLP receptor can activate the recombinant PLC β3, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with cDNAs encoding PLC β3 and the C5a or fMLP receptor. No ligand-induced accumulation of IPs was observed (Fig. 1), indicating that the receptors cannot activate the recombinant PLC β3 either. To test whether the recombinant PLC β3 can be activated by recombinant G protein subunits, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with cDNA encoding β-galactosidase (as control), Gαq, Gα11, Gα16, Gβ1γ1, or Gβ1γ5 and cDNA encoding PLC β3 as well as other PLC β isoforms as controls. As shown in Fig. 2, the recombinant PLC β3 as well as PLC β1 and β2 can all be activated by Gαq, Gα11, or Gα16 (Fig. 2) as cells cotransfected with cDNAs encoding PLC β and Gαq, Gα11, or Gα16 showed marked accumulation of IPs over those transfected with PLC β or Gα alone. However, Gβ1γ1 or Gβ1γ5 showed only weak activation of the recombinant PLC β3, whereas the Gβγ subunits markedly activated the recombinant PLC β2 (Fig. 2). The Gβγ subunits did not activate PLC β1 or PLCβ4 (Fig. 2), as we have demonstrated previously (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 18Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 19Jiang H. Wu D. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7593-7596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The weak activation of PLC β3 by Gβγ may explain why the C5a or fMLP receptors could not activate PLC β3. The expression levels of PLC β3 were determined. The levels of the recombinant PLC β3 are at least 5-fold higher than those of the endogenous PLC β3, and the levels of the recombinant PLC β3 in various transfectants are rather constant (Fig. 2B). The ligand-binding sites on cells expressing the C5a receptor were also determined using 125I-labeled C5a. Cells coexpressing the C5a receptor and β-galactosidase, PLC β3, or PLC β2 showed similar numbers of ligand-binding sites (300-375 fmol per 1 × 105 cells) with affinities of 2.5-4 nM. Thus, the inabilities of Gβγ or the C5a receptor to activate PLC β3 were not the result of variations in protein expression. Furthermore, we compared the expression level of the recombinant PLC β3 with that of PLC β2 in transfected COS cells. Dilutions of cell extracts from cells expressing recombinant PLC β2 or PLC β3, together with dilutions of purified PLC β2 or β3 proteins with defined protein concentrations, were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific to PLC β2 or β3. Based on the signal intensities, we estimated that the expression levels of recombinant PLC β2 and PLC β3 in transfected COS-7 cells are 0.1-0.3 µg/105 cells (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Gβγ is a poor activator for PLC β3 when compared with PLC β2 in the cotransfection assay. In order to obtain more evidence for involvement of Gβγ in C5a- or fMLP-mediated activation of PLC, we investigated whether the Gγ mutants, with substitution of the C-terminal Cys residues by Ser residues, can act as dominant negative mutants to inhibit Gβγ-mediated PLC activation. The Gγ1 and Gγ2 mutants, designated Gγ1CS and Gγ2CS, were found to be able to bind to the Gβ subunits and bring them into the cytosol (30Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These Gγ mutants, when paired with the Gβ subunits, failed to activate PLC β2 (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 18Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggesting that the complex of GγCS and Gβ is nonfunctional. Recently, we introduced the equivalent mutation into Gγ3. The Gγ3 mutant Gγ3CS, like Gγ2CS and Gγ1CS (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), cannot activate PLC β2 (Fig. 3A). However, Gγ3CS differs from Gγ1CS and Gγ2CS in its ability to associate with the particulate fractions; Gγ3CS, unlike Gγ1CS and Gγ2CS (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), can still associate with the particulate fraction (Fig. 3B). The cotransfection assay was used to test whether these Gγ mutants are capable of acting as dominant negative mutants to inhibit Gβγ-mediated effects. We found that cells cotransfected with cDNAs encoding PLC β2, Gβ1, Gγ3, and Gγ3CS showed little accumulation of IPs compared with those cotransfected with PLC β2, Gβ1, and Gγ3 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Gγ3CS inhibited Gβ1γ3-mediated activation of PLC β2. To test whether the Gγ mutants can block ligand-mediated responses, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with cDNAs encoding PLC β2, the C5a receptor, and one of the Gγ mutants. As shown in Fig. 4A, Gγ2CS and Gγ3CS were capable of blocking C5a-mediated accumulation of IPs, whereas the wild types and Gγ1CS could not. Knowing that COS-7 cells contain Gβ1 and Gβ2 (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and that Gγ1CS cannot interact with Gβ2 (30Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we interpreted the Gγ1CS results to suggest that Gγ2CS and Gγ3CS may be able to scavenge most of the Gβ subunits in the cells to prevent them from activating PLC, whereas Gγ1CS is unable to scavenge Gβ2, thus failing to inhibit C5a-mediated effects. We also determined the expression levels of PLC β2 and the numbers of C5a-binding sites on cells expressing the C5a receptors. Coexpression of various Gγ subunits did not significantly affect C5a-binding sites on various transfectants (~350 fmol/1 × 105 cells) neither did it affect the expression levels of PLC β2 (Fig. 4C). Therefore, inhibition of Gβγ- (Fig. 3A) and C5a (Fig. 4A)-mediated PLC activation by the Gγ22,3 mutants is unlikely to result from changes in the expression levels of the proteins involved in activation of PLC β2. The same result was also observed for the fMLP receptor, i.e. the Gγ2,3 mutants can inhibit fMLP-mediated activation of PLCβ2 in transfected COS-7 cells (data not shown). In addition, it is interesting to note that the Gγ mutants did not appear to affect Gα-mediated effector activation. In cotransfected COS-7 cells, Gγ3CS (Fig. 4B) and Gγ2CS (data not shown) did not inhibit m1-muscarinic receptor-mediated activation of PLC, which is mediated by the Gα subunits of the Gq class (7Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smarck A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the Gγ mutants, Gγ2CS and Gγ3CS, appear to only affect Gβγ-mediated responses but not Gα-mediated responses. In summary, these results support the idea that the Gβγ subunits mediate fMLP- and C5a-induced activation of PLC β2. In this report, we have demonstrated that the C5a and fMLP receptors, like the IL-8 (18Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and m2-muscarinic receptors (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), can interact with PTx-sensitive G proteins (presumably Gi2) causing the release of the Gβγ subunits, which then specifically activate PLC β2 in a PTx-sensitive manner. Although these two receptors can also couple to Gα16, we believe that the Gβγ-mediated pathway may be the predominant one that occurs in leukocytes, because the responses to these chemoattractants in mature leukocytes are mostly PTx-sensitive. Our results are also consistent with previous results demonstrating that the C5a and fMLP receptors can interact with the Gi2 proteins (35Polakis P.G. Uhing R.J. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4869-4976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Rollins T.E. Siciliano S. Kobayashi S. Cianciarulo D.N. Bonilla-Arguda V. Collier K. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Regulation of PLC β1, -β2, and -β4 by Gβγ has been tested before in the cotransfection assay (17Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 18Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 19Jiang H. Wu D. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7593-7596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but here PLC β3 was tested in this assay system for the first time. To our surprise, PLC β3 can only be weakly activated by Gβγ in the cotransfection assay system. Gβγ was previously shown to activate PLC β3 effectively in in vitro reconstitution assays with purified proteins (23Ueda N. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Smrcka A. Sternweis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9663-9674Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 25Park Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Lee K.-H. Rhee S.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, there are other examples of apparent specificity in the cellular system that are not seen in vitro. For instance, Schultz and his co-workers (49Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 50Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) have demonstrated receptor-mediated specificity for G protein heterotrimers that is not evident in the reconstitution system (23Ueda N. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are probably other factors, such as substrate compartmentalization, modification, and membrane interaction and the involvement of accessory proteins, which may mediate specificity in the cellular system. Nevertheless, the weak activation of PLC β3 by Gβγ explains the inabilities of the chemoattractant receptors to activate endogenous or recombinant PLC β3 in COS-7 cells and may explain the lack of significant PLC activation by non-Gq-coupling receptors in many systems where PLC β3 is expressed. However, activation of PLC β3 by Gβγ may occur in vivo in cells where the expression levels of PLC β3 are higher than those of the recombinant in COS-7 cells or where the subcellular localization of PLC β3 or production of accessory proteins is differently regulated. As we have demonstrated, the Gγ mutants, Gγ2CS and Gγ3CS in particular, can serve as dominant negative mutants to inhibit Gβγ-mediated, but not Gα-mediated, activation of PLC. This is presumably due to their abilities to form complexes with all known Gβ subunits. Although the Gγ1CS and Gγ2CS mutants were demonstrated to be capable of binding to Gβ (30Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we do not know whether the complexes of GγCS and Gβ can still interact with PLC β2. In other words, it is not clear whether the changes in the Gγ mutants impair the abilities of the Gβγ complexes to interact with PLC β2 or their abilities to activate PLC β2. However, the ability of the Gγ3CS mutant to associate with the particulate fractions indicates that the lipid modification on the Cys residue may not serve only as an anchor for Gβγ, but it may also have other functions. The lipid modification at the C-terminal Cys residue may either participate in effector activation or in orientation of the βγ complexes to allow better access of effectors to their substrates on the membranes. It appears paradoxical that the Gγ mutants had no effect on m1-muscarinic receptor-mediated activation of PLC because Gβγ was shown to be essential for reconstitution of m1-receptor-mediated activation of PLC in an in vitro system using purified proteins (7Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smarck A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.-G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 73: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We suggest two possible interpretations. 1) There may still be interactions between receptors and Gα subunits in the absence of Gβγ depending on the nature of receptors and G proteins, but Gβγ may greatly facilitate the interactions. In the COS-7 overexpression system, the requirement for Gβγ may be overcome by the high expression levels of α subunits and receptors. 2) The Gγ mutants did not scavenge all of the Gβ subunits; hence, there may be enough normal Gβγ complexes present so that Gα-mediated activation of effectors is largely unaffected. The result that more Gβγ is required for activation of PLC than Gα supports the second possibility (24Smrcka A. Sternweis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9663-9674Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 39Lee S.G. Shin S.H. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

The GγCS mutants may not only inhibit Gβγ-mediated activation of PLC, but they should also be able to block other Gβγ-mediated regulation of effectors, including adenylylcyclases (23Ueda N. Lee E.

We have now purified both proteins to apparent homogeneity from extracts of E. coli carrying the hslVU operon on a multicopy plasmid. HslU by itself cleaved ATP, and pure HslV is a weak peptidase degrading certain hydrophobic peptides. HslU dramatically stimulated peptide hydrolysis by HslV when ATP is present.

One of the most intriguing feature of protein breakdown in eukaryotes as well as in prokaryotic cells is the requirement of metabolic energy (1Goldberg A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 2Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the 26 S proteasome is the major ATP-dependent protease responsible for selective degradation of proteins with aberrant structures and many short-lived proteins important in metabolic regulation and cell cycle progression (3Seufert W.

The 20 S proteasome, which consists of 14 different subunits of 21–32 kDa, forms the catalytic core of the 26 S proteasome (10Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol.

The ATP-dependent protease Ti (Clp) consists of two different multimeric components, both of which are required for proteolysis. Component A (ClpA), which is composed of 84-kDa subunits, contains ATP-hydrolyzing sites, while component P (ClpP), which is composed of 21-kDa subunits, is a serine protease. When isolated, ClpA shows protein-activated ATPase activity, which in the reconstituted ClpAP complex is linked to protein breakdown. ClpA is a member of a family of highly conserved polypeptides, present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (19Gottesman S. Squires C. Pichersky E. Carrington M. Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Dalryple B. Kuramitsu H. Shioza T. Foster T. Clark W.C. Ross B. Squires C.L. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3513-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This family of proteins is further divided into at least five subfamilies, ClpA, ClpB, ClpC, ClpX, and ClpY (20Squires C. Squires C.L. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ClpA/B/C family have two regions of particularly high homology, each of which contains a consensus sequence for ATP binding (22Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay J.N. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). ClpX and ClpY contain a single consensus ATP binding-site sequence, which is very similar to those found in the ClpA/B/C family of proteins (21Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ClpX can combine with ClpP to form an additional type of ATP-dependent protease that is capable of degrading several regulatory proteins (21Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J.

Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blattner and co-workers (26Chuang S.E. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5242-5252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunket III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have recently identified 26 new heat shock genes in E. coli, termed hsl genes. Of these, the hslVU operon has been shown to specify proteins of 19 kDa (HslV) and 50 kDa (HslU). The primary sequence of HslV has been shown to be similar to that of certain β-type subunits of the 20 S proteasomes from eukaryotes, the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum (28Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), and certain bacteria. In particular, the N terminus of HslV contains two adjacent Thr residues, and the Thr residue at the N terminus of mature β-type subunits of the 20 S proteasome has been demonstrated to be crucial for the its proteolytic activity (29Fenteany G. Stanaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HslU is very similar to a Pasteurella haemolytica protein, LapA of unknown function, which belongs to the ClpY subfamily (21Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunket III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that HslV and HslU comprise a new type of ATP-dependent protease in E. coli, which degrades the fluorogenic peptide N-carbobenzoxy (Cbz) 1The abbreviations used are: CbzcarbobenzoxySucsuccinylAMC7-amido-4-methyl coumarinDTTdithiothreitol.-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (AMC) in the presence of ATP (30Rohrwild M.

Furthermore, an antibody against HslV precipitates HslV together with HslU from crude extracts. Thus these proteins probably function as a proteolytic complex in vivo, although additional factors may also be required for protease activity. In order to characterize further the enzymological properties of HslV and HslU, we cloned the hslVU operon and purified each of its products from an E. coli strain that contains the operon on a multicopy plasmid. We report here the purification of HslV and HslU proteins and the reconstitution of ATP-dependent peptidase activity. These studies clearly demonstrate that HslU is an ATPase essential for peptide hydrolysis by the purified HslV, and that HslV influences the ATPase function of HslU. carbobenzoxy succinyl 7-amido-4-methyl coumarin dithiothreitol. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystem, model 384A) and purified by gel electrophoresis as recommended by the manufacturer. All reagents for the polymerase chain reaction, including Taq polymerase, were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Peptide substrates were obtained from BACHEM Feinchemikalien AG, Switzerland, and Peptide Institute Inc., Japan. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. The hslVU operon was cloned by the polymerase chain reaction amplification method. Nucleotide sequences of the primers used for the amplification were based on the data of Blattner and co-workers (27Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunket III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar): 5′-CTGCATTCGGCTCGCCGCCGGG-3′ (i.e. 120 bp upstream of the translational start site of hslV) and 5′-GCAGCAAAGGCGAGGGGGAGGG-3′ (146 base pairs downstream of the translational termination site of hslU). Reaction mixtures for the polymerase chain reaction amplification (0.1 ml) contained 0.5 µg of the E. coli K12 genomic DNA, 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase, 1 × polymerase chain reaction buffer, 0.2 mM each of deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 50 pmol of the primers. The reactions were carried out for 30 cycles using a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer) and generated a 2.2-kilobase pair DNA fragment. The resulting fragments were then ligated into pGEM-T vector (Promega). The E. coli XL2-Blue cells (Stratagene) harboring pGEM-T/HslVU were grown in Luria broth at 37°C overnight and kept frozen at −70°C until use. The frozen cells (about 40 g) were thawed and resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer (pH 6.5) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 10% (v/v) glycerol (referred to as buffer A). The cells were then disrupted with a French press at 14,000 p.s.i. and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h. The supernatants were dialyzed against the same buffer and referred to as crude extracts. E. coli were grown in Luria broth until an A600 of 0.7. The cells were lysed in 2% SDS and subjected to electrophoresis on 13% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels containing SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204082) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with antiserum raised against the purified HslV or HslU. The membranes were then stained with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to anti-rabbit IgGs (32Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). The antisera against the Hsl proteins were prepared by injecting each protein into albino rabbits. Peptide hydrolysis was assayed as described previously (33Woo K.M. Chung W.J. Ha D.B. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2088-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC as the substrate. Reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) contained the peptide (0.1 mM) and appropriate amounts of the purified HslV and HslU or HslV alone in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA. Incubations were performed for 10–40 min at 37°C and stopped by adding 0.1 ml of 1% (w/v) SDS and 0.8 ml of 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 9.1. The release of AMC were then measured. ATP hydrolysis was assayed by incubating the similar reaction mixtures at 37°C. After incubation, 0.1 ml of 1% SDS were added to the samples, and the phosphate released was determined as described elsewhere (34Ames B. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (2979) Google Scholar). Proteins were assayed by their absorbance at 280 nm or by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207602) Google Scholar) using bovine albumin as a standard. E. coli cells harboring pGEM-T/HslVU were grown overnight, lysed in 2% SDS, and electrophoresed on 13% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels containing SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol. Two major bands representing 19-kDa (HslV) and 50-kDa (HslU) polypeptides were detected in cells carrying the recombinant plasmid, but not in cells containing only the vector (Fig. 1A). Moreover, antibodies raised against the purified HslV and HslU (see below) strongly interacted with these proteins in cell lysates (Fig. 1B), and therefore identified the two overproduced protein as HslV and HslU. Neither of these antibodies cross-reacted with purified protease La, or the ClpA or ClpP components of protease Ti (data not shown). These results confirm that both proteins are encoded from the hslVU operon and that they are cotranscribed as previously suggested (27Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunket III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To purify HslV and HslU, the crude extracts (3.5 g) from 40 g of the E. coli cells harboring pGEM-T/HslVU were loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (2.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. After collecting the flow-through fraction, the column was washed extensively with buffer A, and the proteins bound to the column were eluted with the same buffer containing 0.4 M phosphate. Since extracts of E. coli contain various unrelated peptidases and ATPases, HslV and HslU proteins were identified during purification by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. HslU was recovered in the flow-through and HslV in the 0.4 M phosphate eluate (data not shown). For purification of HslV, the proteins eluted with 0.4 M phosphate were dialyzed against buffer A and loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (1 × 8 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column, the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05-0.5 M phosphate. The fractions containing the 19-kDa HslV protein were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol (buffer B), and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.5 × 6 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.3 M NaCl. The HslV-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM30 membrane (Amicon), and chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-300 column (2 × 80 cm) equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.1 M NaCl (Fig. 2A). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the column fractions reveals that HslV was purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2B). Recently, we have demonstrated that the HslV/HslU proteins could be coimmunoprecipitated by an antibody against HslV, and that these proteins hydrolyzed the fluorogenic peptide Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC in an ATP-dependent fashion (30Rohrwild M. Coux O. Hunag H.C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Since the primary sequence of HslV is related to that of the catalytic β-type subunits of the 20 S proteasomes (27Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunket III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), we examined whether purified HslV protein is capable of cleaving any peptide substrate of the 20 S proteasome. Purified HslV alone cleaved Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC (Fig. 2A), although to a much lesser extent than in the presence of the purified HslU (see below). In addition, the extent of peptide hydrolysis was proportional to the protein content in each fraction from the Sephacryl S-300 column (Fig. 2A). The fractions containing HslV from the Sephacryl S-300 column were pooled and kept frozen at −70°C. For purification of HslU, the flow-through fraction from the initial phosphocellulose column was dialyzed against buffer B and loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (2 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with buffer B containing 0.15 M NaCl, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15-0.3 M NaCl. The fractions containing HslU were pooled, diluted 1:1 with buffer B, and applied to a heparin-agarose column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2-0.5 M NaCl. The HslU-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM30 membrane, and chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-300 column (2 × 80 cm) equilibrated with buffer-B containing 0.1 M NaCl. The fractions containing the 50-kDa HslU protein were pooled and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column, the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1-0.3 M NaCl, and aliquots were electrophoresed as above (Fig. 3A). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggested that HslU was purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 3B). Since HslU contains an ATP-binding motif (27Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunket III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we examined whether the purified protein exhibits ATPase activity. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was proportional to the HslU content in each fraction (Fig. 3A). The fractions containing HslU were pooled and kept frozen at −70°C. From 40 g of E. coli carrying the hslVU operon on a multicopy plasmid (i.e. on the pGEM-T vector), we obtained approximately 8 mg of purified HslV and 60 mg of purified HslU. The proteins were stable for at least 1 month, when kept at −70°C in the presence of 20% glycerol and 1 mM DTT. Storage at 4°C in the absence of DTT or repeated freezing and thawing rapidly inactivated both proteins. In order to determine the sizes of HslV and HslU, each of the purified proteins was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column (1 × 40 cm) equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.1 M NaCl. Since HslU interacts with ATP, chromatography was performed in the presence or absence of ATP. The purified HslV consistently ran as a 250-kDa complex whether or not ATP was present (Fig. 4A); thus, it appears to be a homopolymer consisting 12–14 subunits. In the absence of ATP, HslU behaved as a 100-kDa protein, which suggests a dimer of 50-kDa subunits, and with ATP it behaved as a 450-kDa protein, which suggests a multimer containing 8–10 subunits (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that ATP plays an important role in the oligomerization of HslU. Since purified HslV by itself hydrolyzes Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC, we first studied the effect of HslU on the peptidase activity of HslV. As shown in Fig. 5A, HslU dramatically stimulated peptide hydrolysis in the presence of ATP, but not in its absence. Moreover, the extent of this stimulation depended on the concentration of HslU (Fig. 5B). In the presence of 0.1 µg of HslV, the extent of peptide hydrolysis increased linearly with increasing the amount of HslU up to 0.8 µg (i.e. to an 1:8 mass ratio of HslV to HslU). This ratio is equivalent to a molar ratio of about 1:4, considering the molecular masses of HslV (250 kDa) and HslU (450 kDa) under nondenaturing conditions. Because approximately 50% of the added peptide was cleaved at the time of incubation, the substrate became limiting under these latter conditions. Increasing peptide concentration was impossible, since the peptide precipitates at concentrations above 0.1 mM. Thus we were not able to determine the Km for the peptide or the optimal ratio of HslV and HslU for complex formation. Therefore further studies of the hydrolysis of ATP or the peptide were carried out in the presence of HslV and HslU at a molar ratio of 1:2 unless otherwise indicated, since the peptidase activity of HslV alone could not be detected when the amount of HslV was decreased any further. We then examined the effect of HslV on the ATPase activity of HslU. In the presence of HslV and HslU at a molar ratio of 1:4, HslV had little or no effect on the ATP hydrolysis by HslU (data not shown and see Fig. 6B). However, at a ratio of 2:1, HslV increased the rate of ATP hydrolysis about 3-fold (Fig. 6A). In addition, the stimulatory effect of HslV was dependent on its concentration (Fig. 6B). To define more precisely the stimulatory effect of HslV, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by HslU was determined in the presence of HslV and increasing concentrations of ATP, although the extent of activation of the peptide-degrading activity of HslV by HslU and ATP at the 2:1 ratio is far less than that at 1:4. Using double reciprocal plots of the data, the Km for ATP was similar in the presence of HslV (0.28 mM) and in its absence (0.31 mM) (Fig. 7). However, the Vmax for ATP hydrolysis by HslU was increased from 57 to 213 pmol/min upon addition of HslV. The peptide substrate of HslV, Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC, had little or no effect on the ATPase activity of HslU, whether or not HslV was present (data not shown). To determine the peptide bond-cleavage specificity of the reconstituted protease, a variety of fluorogenic peptides were tested for hydrolysis by incubation of HslV and HslU (the HslVU protease) in the presence of ATP. Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC was cleaved by the HslVU protease at a rate of about 1550 pmol/min. N-Succinyl (Suc)-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, which is commonly used as a substrate for assaying the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome, was also hydrolyzed by the HslVU protease but at a rate of about 60 pmol/min. ATP also stimulated the hydrolysis of the latter peptide but only about 3-fold. However, the HslVU protease showed little or no activity against other hydrophobic peptides, including Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC, Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-AMC or Suc-Gly-Gly-Phe-methoxynaphthylamide, or against basic or acidic peptides (data not shown) (30Rohrwild M. Coux O. Hunag H.C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). The effects of various nucleotides were compared to characterize further the ATPase activity of the reconstituted HslVU protease and to test whether only hydrolyzed nucleotide is essential to activate the enzyme's peptidase activity. As shown in Table I, only the nucleotides that were hydrolyzed could activate the hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC. dATP, CTP, and α,β-methylene ATP were hydrolyzed 15–35% as rapidly as ATP and supported peptide cleavage at 15–40% the rate of ATP. In contrast, GTP and UTP were not hydrolyzed and did not stimulate peptide hydrolysis. ADP and AMP were not substrates for HslU and did not activate the peptide cleavage by HslVU protease. Furthermore, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, β,γ-methylene ATP, did not support peptide hydrolysis. These results indicate that the HslVU protease requires ATP hydrolysis by HslU for peptidase function and that the nucleotide hydrolysis correlate with peptide cleavage. To characterize further the catalytic mechanism of the HslVU protease, the effects of a variety of site-specific reagents and protease inhibitors were examined. Preincubation of HslV with high concentrations of the serine protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mM) or diisopropyl fluorophosphate (10 mM), inhibited the ATP-dependent hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC by about 70%. Preincubation of HslV with a sulfhydryl-blocking agent, N-ethylmaleimide, followed by inactivation of the inhibitor with DTT, also resulted in the inhibition of the peptide hydrolysis. HslV contains one cysteine residue; HslU has two (27Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunket III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also studied the effect of N-ethylmaleimide on the ATPase activity of HslU and its ability to activate the peptidase function of HslV. As shown in Fig. 8, N-ethylmaleimide caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of both activities to a similar extent. None of the other inhibitors tested had any effect on the ATPase activity of HslU, whether or not HslV was present (data not shown). Thus, the free sulfhydryl residues in HslU, as well as in HslV, seem to play an important role in the function of the protein and hence in the ATP-stimulated peptide hydrolysis. The purpose of this work was to gain further insight into the subunit composition and mode of action of the recently discovered HslVU protease in E. coli (30Rohrwild M. Coux O. Hunag H.C.

We have purified its two components, the heat shock proteins HslV and HslU, to apparent homogeneity and proven that HslU is an ATPase, while HslV by itself is a weak peptidase that degraded certain hydrophobic peptides, such as Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC. HslU markedly activated peptide hydrolysis by HslV, while HslV increased the rate of ATP hydrolysis by HslU. Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis appears to be tightly coupled to the cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide, since these two processes were roughly proportional to one another with different nucleotides, and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, β,γ-methylene ATP did not support peptide cleavage. The in vitro reconstitution of ATP-dependent peptidase activity from purified HslV and HslU proteins clearly demonstrates that the HslVU protease is a new type of two-component protease. It is noteworthy that the magnitude of the stimulation of peptide hydrolysis by ATP was dependent on the amount of HslV added (i.e. the molar ratio of HslU over HslV). For example, ATP stimulated peptide hydrolysis about 50-fold with HslV and HslU at a ratio of 1:1 and more than 200-fold at a ratio of 1:4. With the purified HslV and HslU, we unfortunately could not determine the stoichiometric ratio that may give a maximal, ATP-stimulated peptidase activity. These findings suggest that the affinity of HslV for HslU is rather low and that the active complex dissociates readily. Accordingly, no high molecular weight complex was formed when mixtures of purified HslV and HslU were incubated and subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 or Superose-6 column in the presence of ATP (data not shown). Direct evidence that HslV and HslU form a complex came from related experiments, where we were able to show that HslV and HslU can be co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, although these two components readily dissociate during purification (30Rohrwild M. Coux O. Hunag H.C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). ATP appears to play a distinct role in the function of the HslVU protease from that in protease Ti (ClpAP). We have previously shown that ClpP, which is the proteolytic component of protease Ti, reduces ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme's ATP-binding component, ClpA, in the absence of protein substrates, but stimulates its ATPase activity in their presence (36Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the peptide substrates of HslV had little or no effect on the ATPase activity of HslU. However, protein substrates of HslV have not yet been identified, and they may also stimulate ATP hydrolysis as they do with ClpA, ClpB ATPase, and protease La. It is noteworthy that ATP hydrolysis is essential for activation of peptide hydrolysis by the HslVU protease, unlike protease Ti, which does not require either ATP binding or cleavage for hydrolysis of small fluorogenic peptide substrates (33Woo K.M. Chung W.J. Ha D.B. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2088-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of ATP in peptide hydrolysis by the HslVU protease is likely to be distinct from that of protease Ti. Interestingly, purified HslU, which is dimeric in the absence of ATP, forms a multimer containing 8–10 subunits of 50 kDa when ATP is present. We have previously shown that the trimeric ClpA becomes a hexamer of 84-kDa subunits upon treatment of ATP (37Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Kim K.I. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29468-29473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ATP appears to play a similar role in oligomerization of the ATPase components of both bacterial ATP-dependent proteases, although the multimeric nature of ClpX, which is an alternative ATPase component of protease Ti, is not yet known. Unlike ClpA, which contains two ATP binding sites, HslU and ClpX have only one site for nucleotide binding. By mutational analysis of clpA, we have recently demonstrated that the first ATP-binding site is responsible for oligomerization, while the second site is essential for the ATPase function (38Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8087-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Effects of mutations in the ATP-binding site of HslU on oligomerization and ATP hydrolysis are under investigation. It has recently been shown, using electron microscopic studies, that ClpP consists of two layers of seven-membered rings (39Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our preliminary electron microscopic studies of fractions containing both HslV and HslU proteins revealed ring-shaped structure very similar to images of ClpP, ClpA, or the top view of the 20 S proteasome and larger structure which appear to be side images of two stacked rings (30Rohrwild M. Coux O. Hunag H.C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Furthermore, the primary sequence of HslV is similar to those of certain β-type subunits of the 20 S proteasome from eukaryotes and from the archaebacterium T. acidophilum (28Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The N-terminal Thr residues of the mature β-type subunits serve as the catalytic site for proteolysis and are covalently linked to lactacystin (29Fenteany G. Stanaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar), a Streptomyces metabolite. Like the β-type subunits of the 20 S proteasome, HslV has two such conserved N termini Thr residues (28Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the peptidase activity of HslV in the presence of HslU and ATP is highly sensitive to peptide aldehyde inhibitors of the 20 S proteasome (40Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar), such as Cbz-Ile-Glu-(O-t-butyl)-Ala-leucinal and Cbz-Leu-Leu-norvalinal, and to lactacystin, which specifically interacts with the N-terminal Thr residue of one subunit of the 20 S proteasome (29Fenteany G. Stanaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar), although to a lesser extent (data not shown) (30Rohrwild M. Coux O. Hunag H.C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Supporting these findings, N-terminal sequencing of the purified HslV has revealed that the N-terminal Met is removed, and that the subsequent two Thr residues is not blocked (30Rohrwild M. Coux O. Hunag H.C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, its hydroxyl group can presumably function as a nucleophile. Therefore we conclude that the HslVU protease is a novel type of protease in the eubacterium E. coli, and that its catalytic mechanism is likely to be similar to that of the mammalian and archaebacterial proteasomes, although HslVU does not contain α-type proteasome subunits. The sequence similarity of HslV to β-type proteasome subunits, and HslU to ClpX, and the fact that the HslVU protease is a two-component system, such as ClpAP and ClpXP, suggest that the properties of the HslVU protease are intermediate between the eukaryotic proteasomes and the Clp family of proteases."

Although these TDs exhibit antiarthritic as well as antitumor and hormone-suppressive properties, they do not inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor kinase and c-Src kinase. 2I. Wiesenberg, unpublished data. Searching again for a molecular target, we hypothesized that these TDs may influence transcriptional regulation as is known for ligands of nuclear hormone receptors such as retinoids, vitamin D3, thyroid hormones, and steroids (10Rosen J.

The superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors contains numerous orphan receptors, for which no ligand has been identified so far (10Rosen J. Day A. Jones T.K. Turner Jones E.T. Nadzan A.M. Stein R.B.

Their physiological role is poorly understood, and the discovery of specific ligands is always a key in understanding their regulatory functions. An important example was the identification of 9-cis-retinoic acid as being a ligand of retinoid X receptors (12Levin A.A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Kazmer S. Bosakowski T. Huselton C. Allenby G. Speck J. Kratzeisen C. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Grippo J.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). We found recently that our lead compound, CGP 52608, was able to specifically bind to and activate the nuclear receptor RZR/RORα in low nanomolar concentrations (13Wiesenberg I. Missbach M.

The characteristic oncostatic, hormone-suppressive, and immunopharmacological properties of the synthetic RZR/RORα ligand CGP 52608 enabled us to identify the pineal hormone melatonin as being a natural ligand of RZR/ROR receptors (13Wiesenberg I.

We describe in this report the structural requirements for CGP 52608 analogues to activate RZR/RORα. Thirteen closely related analogues were tested for receptor-mediated gene activation in a potent Drosophila model system and for inhibition of adjuvant arthritis to determine whether we could find any correlation between RZR/RORα activation and inhibition of this experimental autoimmune disease. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) was obtained from Fluka. Thiazolidine diones and S 20098 (Servier; N-acetyl-2-(7-methoxynaphthalin-1-yl)ethylamine) were synthesized by Chemical Research, Ciba-Geigy (Basel, Switzerland).

The cDNAs of human RZR/RORα, human VDR, chicken T3Rα, human RARα, and human RXRα have been subcloned into the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene). Drosophila SL-3 cells (2 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate) were grown overnight in Schneider's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) without fetal calf serum. Liposomes were formed by incubating 2 µg of the reporter plasmid, 1 µg of receptor expression vectors, and 1 µg of the reference plasmid pCH110 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with 11 µg of N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Boehringer Mannheim) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 100 µl. After dilution with 0.9 ml of Schneider's medium, the liposomes were added to the cells. 4-8 h after transfection, 500 µl of Schneider's medium supplemented with the indicated ligand was added. After a further 16 h, the cells were harvested, and CAT assays were performed as described (29Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J.-P. Guerin S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CAT activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity, and induction factors were calculated as the ratio of CAT activity of ligand-stimulated cells to that of mock-induced controls. Each condition was analyzed at least in triplicate, and data are shown as means ± S.D. Adjuvant arthritis was induced as described previously (30Wiesenberg I. van der Meide P.H. Schellekens H. Alkan S.S Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 78: 245-249PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, male Lewis rats (LEW/TIF, SPF, 150-180 g of body weight, five animals/group) were immunized by an intraplantar injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (0.2 mg of heat-killed Mycobacterium butyricum (Difco) in 0.05 ml of paraffin oil (Riedel de Haen)) into the left hind paw (day 0). This procedure induced arthritis in 100% of the animals. Disease progression was followed by plethysmographic edema measurements of the injected hind paw (primary lesion) and the noninjected hind paw (secondary lesion), and joint destruction was assessed by radiography on day 32. Lesions in the tarso/metatarsophalangeal and carpo/metacarpophalangeal regions of hind and fore paws were assessed by scoring as described (30Wiesenberg I. van der Meide P.H. Schellekens H. Alkan S.S Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 78: 245-249PubMed Google Scholar). Test compounds were given orally to five animals/group between 8.00 and 10.00 a.m. from days 0 to 30 (or as indicated) in 10 ml/kg of 0.75% methylcellulose.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SL-3 cells are very robust cells that survive more than 2 days in the absence of serum. Since RZR/ROR shows in the presence of serum a rather high constitutive activity (13Wiesenberg I. Missbach M. Kahlen J.-P. Schraeder M. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 15Carlberg C. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Staple J. DeLamarter J.F. Becker-Andre M. Mol.

SL-3 cells were transfected with the expression vector for human RZR/RORα and a thymidine kinase-CAT reporter construct containing the RZR/ROR response element of the human 5-lipoxygenase gene (21Steinhilber D.

It is interesting to note that melatonin causes a transcriptional activation from this heterologous promoter construct in the Drosophila system, whereas in human B lymphocytes, it causes repression (21Steinhilber D. Brungs M. Werz O. Wiesenberg I. Danielsson C. Kahlen J.-P. Nayeri S. Schraeder M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7037-7040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the effect of 13 TDs (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) on RZR/RORα-induced gene activation in comparison with the effect of the natural RZR/ROR ligand melatonin. All compounds were tested at 100 nM concentrations under serum-free conditions. Five TDs (CGP 52608, CGP 52528, CGP 53065, CGP 53079, and CGP 58238) and melatonin stimulated RZRα-mediated gene activity 5-7-fold, whereas seven TDs (CGP 52113, CGP 52749, CGP 55644, CGP 55706, CGP 55707, CGP 56753, and GP 50468) showed <1.5-fold induction and were therefore considered to be inactive. The specificity of gene activation by TDs and melatonin was tested on typical vitamin D3, thyroid hormone, and all-trans-retinoic acid signaling pathways. From DR3-, DR4- and DR5-type response elements, which were cotransfected with RXRα and human VDR, chicken T3Rα, or human RARα, respectively, we obtained only significant gene activation with the specific ligands 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, thyroid hormone, and all-trans-retinoic acid, but not with 12 of the 13 TDs or melatonin (Fig. 3, B-D). An exception was CGP 55066, which moderately but nonspecifically activated all four nuclear signaling pathways. We then performed dose responses with the five specifically RZR/RORα-activating TDs and melatonin for reporter gene activation via the 5-lipoxygenase RZR/ROR response element. The same experimental conditions as described for Fig. 3A were used, and graded concentrations of compounds between 10−11 and 10−6M were used for stimulation (Fig. 4). We obtained typical sigmoidal dose-response curves that provided EC50 values between 0.5 and 6.0 nM for TDs and of 1.0 nM for melatonin. We first performed detailed investigations with the structural lead compound CGP 52608 in rat adjuvant arthritis and found that this compound was active under prophylactic as well as therapeutic test conditions.2 Here we show the effects of prophylactic treatment of arthritic rats with low doses of CGP 52608 (Fig. 5). Drug treatment was started at the day of arthritis induction (day 0) and was continued up to day 38. The inflammatory edema in both hind paws was dose-dependently inhibited, and highly significant suppressive effects were measured with oral doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg. Destructive processes in the joints of the injected hind paw (primary lesions) and the noninjected paws (secondary lesions) at day 32 were also significantly inhibited. We then tested all TDs (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) using the same experimental protocol as described for Fig. 5 and sought to determine whether we could find any correlation between antiarthritic activity and RZR/RORα activation. The results are summarized in Table I. All five RZR/RORα-activating TDs significantly suppressed the inflammatory edema and inhibited joint destruction at oral doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg (Figs. 5, 6, 7). On the other hand, four out of seven receptor-inactive TDs (CGP 52749, CGP 55707, CGP 56753, and GP 50468) and the nonspecific compound CGP 55066 were inactive up to the highest doses tested (5 or 10 mg/kg per os). The remaining three compounds (CGP 55644, CGP 52113, and CGP 55706) were either distinctly less potent or only active during the late phase of arthritis. The N-2 methylated compound CGP 55644 was inactive up to 1 mg/kg, but exhibited weak antiarthritic effects at 10 mg/kg, starting around day 20 after arthritis induction. The N-propyl derivative CGP 52113 was active at 1 mg/kg per os from day 12 onward, and CGP 55706 with two methyl groups at N-4 showed significant but delayed inhibition at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg, starting around day 25. The antiarthritic effects of these three receptor-inactive TDs might be explained by prodrug cleavage. Taken together, our results show a good correlation between activation of human RZR/RORα and antiarthritic activity in rat adjuvant arthritis for 13 TDs with closely related structures.Table I.Comparison of RZR/RORα activation and activity in rat adjuvant arthritisCompoundRZR/RORα EC50Antiarthritic activity (mg/kg per os)0.010.11.010nMCGP 526081.8+++CGP 525286.0−++CGP 530650.5−++CGP 530792.8−++CGP 582381.5+++CGP 52113InactiveaInactive or nonspecific activity at 100 nM.NDbND, not determined.ND+CGP 52749InactiveNDNDND− (5)CGP 55644InactiveND−−+CGP 55706InactiveND++CGP 55707Inactive−−−−CGP 56753Inactive−−−− (5)GP 50468InactiveND−−−CGP 55066NonspecificaInactive or nonspecific activity at 100 nM.NDND−−Melatonin1.0+/−+/−+/−+/−S 20098Inactive−−−−a Inactive or nonspecific activity at 100 nM.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab We repeatedly tested the natural RZR/ROR ligand melatonin in doses between 0.001 and 10 mg/kg per os in rat adjuvant arthritis. Although this model always gave reproducible results with TDs as well as with the reference compounds prednisolone and cyclosporin A, we obtained inconsistent results with melatonin. In some of the experiments, melatonin caused significant but not dose-dependent inhibitory effects, whereas in other experiments, the hormone was completely inactive (Table I). We assume that environmental (maybe seasonal) influences and the very short plasma half-life of orally administered melatonin (33Vitte P.A. Harthe C. Lestage P. Claustrat B. Bobillier P. J. Pineal Res. 1988; 5: 437-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) could explain our variable results. It is clear, however, that all five RZR/RORα-activating TDs were much more potent in inhibiting adjuvant arthritis than melatonin, although their EC50 values for RZR/RORα activation in the Drosophila system were comparable (Fig. 3A). Finally, we investigated a melatonin agonist with specificity for the membrane receptor. We found that the Servier compound S 20098, which is a highly potent melatonin agonist at the membrane receptor (34Depreux P. Lesieur D. Mansour H.A. Morgan P. Howell H.E. Renard P. Caignard D.-H. Pfeiffer B. Delagrange P. Guardiola B. Yous S. Demarque A. Adam G. Andrieux J. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), was not able to induce transcriptional activation via RZR/RORα under conditions described for Fig. 3 (data not shown) and was inactive in adjuvant arthritis in doses between 0.01 and 10 mg/kg per os (Table I). We have discovered a structurally novel class of thiazolidine diones with high potency in inhibiting inflammation and joint destruction in rat adjuvant arthritis, which is a chronic T cell-dependent autoimmune disease. Compared with reference compounds with known antiarthritic activity in this model such as corticosteroids, cyclosporin A, cytostatic compounds, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors, these TDs have a distinctly different pharmacological profile.2 Besides their activity in adjuvant arthritis, they suppress other experimental autoimmune diseases and exhibit oncostatic and hormone-suppressive properties, but they do not cause a systemic immuno- or myelosuppression. They also do not inhibit the activity of the enzymes cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, and phospholipases A and C. We therefore suggested a novel mechanism of action and have found that the lead compound CGP 52608 specifically activates the orphan nuclear receptor RZR/RORα in low nanomolar concentrations (13Wiesenberg I. Missbach M. Kahlen J.-P. Schraeder M. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Here we show for 13 CGP 52608 analogues a striking correlation between their antiarthritic activity and their ability to activate RZR/RORα (Table I). Five TDs (Fig. 1) activate RZR/RORα, whereas eight closely related analogues (Fig. 2) are inactive, with the exception of CGP 55066, which has moderate nonselective activity. All compounds shown in Fig. 1 exhibit potent antiarthritic activity, whereas the compounds shown in Fig. 2 are either inactive or distinctly less potent. The resulting structure-activity relationship for receptor activation by this series of CGP 52608 analogues is summarized in Fig. 8. Neither propyl (CGP 52113) nor benzyl (CGP 52749) is tolerated as a substituent at the ring amide, whereas allyl (CGP 52608), methallyl (CGP 52528), and propinyl (CGP 53065) activate the receptor. Disubstitution (compared with CGP 52608) at N-4 (CGP 55706 and CGP 55707), as well as an unsubstituted N-4 (GP 50468), results in loss of activity. Both replacement of N-2 by a carbon atom (CGP 56753) or its methylation (CGP 55644) inactivate as well. Some modifications at the ring system (methylation, CGP 53079; homologation to a six-membered ring, CGP 58238) lead to compounds that retain full activity. The sulfur in the thiosemicarbazone part seems to be crucial for activity (CGP 52608 versus CGP 55066). It is important to note that competition experiments with [125I]iodomelatonin and [3H]CGP 52608 (13Wiesenberg I. Missbach M. Kahlen J.-P. Schraeder M. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) indicate that TDs do not undergo a covalent interaction with RZR/RORα and therefore do not form disulfide bridges with cysteine side chains. The finding that compounds with an identical thiosemicarbazone part but different R1 substituents (e.g. CGP 52608 versus CGP 52113 and CGP 52749) are either active or inactive shows that activation of RZR/RORα cannot be simply rationalized by the known ability of thiosemicarbazones to complex different heavy metals. Based on these results, we suggest that these TDs exert their antiarthritic activity and potentially other pharmacological effects at least in part via RZR/RORα-mediated nuclear signaling processes. It is very interesting that structurally and pharmacologically different thiazolidine diones have been recently identified as ligands of the orphan nuclear receptor PPARγ (35Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B.

Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Since these compounds have antidiabetic and adipocyte differentiation-inducing properties, a pivotal role for PPARγ and its endogenous ligand(s) in adipocyte development and glucose homeostasis is suggested. Several lines of evidence have shown that the pineal gland hormone melatonin is a natural ligand of RZR/ROR (Refs. 13Wiesenberg I. Missbach M. Kahlen J.-P. Schraeder M. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar and 20Becker-Andre M. Wiesenberg I. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Andre E. Missbach M. Saurat J.-H. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28531-28534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this paper). Although we were unable to demonstrate consistent therapeutic effects with melatonin in rat adjuvant arthritis, CGP 52608 analogues and melatonin share several characteristic pharmacological features, which point to a common mechanism of action. The best known physiological role of melatonin is its function as a transmitter of photoperiodic information and regulator of seasonal reproduction (37Reiter R.J. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 654-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). A functionally active high affinity G protein-coupled melatonin membrane receptor has recently been cloned (38Ebisawa T. Karne S. Lerner M.R. Reppert S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 39Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Ebisawa T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1177-1185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) and is thought to mediate the circadian effects of the hormone (40Morgan P.J. Barrett P. Howell H.E. Helliwell R. Neurochem. Int. 1994; 24: 101-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). However, melatonin additionally exhibits oncostatic effects and influences various immunological and endocrinological functions (41Yu H.-S. Reiter R.J. Melatonin: Biosynthesis, Physiological Effects, and Clinical Applications. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar). Similar properties are also known for CGP 52608 analogues. It has been suggested that melatonin is involved in basic mechanisms controlling cell growth and differentiation (42Hill S.M. Blask D.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6121-6126PubMed Google Scholar, 43Cos S. Blask D.E. Lemos-Wilson A. Hill S.M. J. Pineal Res. 1991; 10: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and nuclear signaling was in fact proposed before the discovery of RZR/ROR (44Acuna-Castroviejo D. Reiter R.J. Menendez-Pelaez A. Pablos M.I. Burgos A. J. Pineal Res. 1994; 16: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 45Menendez-Pelaez A. Poeggeler B. Reiter R.J. Barlow-Walden L. Pablos M.I. Tan D.-X. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It is currently not clear whether nuclear and membrane signaling are functionally linked or whether both pathways mediate different effector functions of the hormone (18Carlberg C. Wiesenberg I. J. Pineal Res. 1995; 18: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 46Hagan R.M. Oakley N.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 81-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since CGP 52608 and its analogues do not bind to the melatonin membrane receptor (13Wiesenberg I. Missbach M. Kahlen J.-P. Schraeder M. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and S 20098, a potent melatonin agonist at the membrane receptor (34Depreux P. Lesieur D. Mansour H.A. Morgan P. Howell H.E. Renard P. Caignard D.-H. Pfeiffer B. Delagrange P. Guardiola B. Yous S. Demarque A. Adam G. Andrieux J. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), does not activate RZR/RORα (this paper), these compounds may lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pleiotropic functions of the neurohormone. We have shown here that S 20098, which influences circadian rhythms in rats in a manner similar to melatonin (47Armstrong S.M. McNulty O.M. Guardiola-Lemaitre B. Redman J.R. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1993; 46: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), has no activity in rat adjuvant arthritis. The intracellular functional changes following RZR/RORα activation and finally causing the described antiarthritic effects of CGP 52608 analogues are not known. It is interesting that the first identified melatonin/RZR/RORα-responding gene, 5-lipoxygenase, a key enzyme in allergic and inflammatory reactions, is down-regulated by melatonin in human B cells (21Steinhilber D. Brungs M. Werz O. Wiesenberg I. Danielsson C. Kahlen J.-P. Nayeri S. Schraeder M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7037-7040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, we suggest that other target genes central to the immunoinflammatory response are also controlled via RZR/RORα-mediated nuclear signaling. The regulation of many genes is typical for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and their ligands and is well known for glucocorticosteroids, retinoids, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D, which all have important modulatory effects on the immune system (48Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar, 49Buck J. Gruen F. Derguini F. Chen Y. Kimura S. Noy N. Haemmerling U. J. Exp.

The discovery of RZR/ROR receptors may open new therapeutic perspectives, and the identification of the first synthetic ligands with interesting pharmacological properties may help to elucidate important physiological functions of these nuclear receptors.

Protein sequencing revealed that CAP is derived from the hamster homolog of Mch2α, a member of the ICE family recently identified based on the sequence conservation among the ICE family members. CAP activity is inhibited by CrmA, a cowpox virus protein that prevents host cell apoptosis. CAP itself is also activated through proteolytic cleavage.

First, CPP32 is closely related to an apoptosis promoting gene (ced-3 of Caenorhabditis elegans) in terms of both sequence similarity and substrate specificity (1Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G.

Third, a cowpox virus protein CrmA and a baculovirus protein p35, both of which prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis, inhibit the activity of CPP32 (2Xue D. Horvitz H.R.

The proteolytic cleavage of PARP during the onset of apoptosis by CPP32 results in the separation of its DNA binding and catalytic domains. This cleavage prevents the catalytic domain of PARP from being recruited to sites of DNA damage and presumably disables the ability of PARP to coordinate subsequent repair and genome maintenance events (3Nicholson W.D.

ICE has also been shown to be able to cleave and activate CPP32 in vitro (4Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Such a protease cascade would provide both the regulation and signal amplification necessary for a highly controlled yet rapid and irreversible process of apoptosis.In this paper, we report the identification and purification of a CPP32-activating protease (CAP) from hamster liver extract. This enzyme specifically cleaves and activates CPP32. The biochemical properties of this protease suggest that it is an ICE-like cysteine protease distinct from ICE and CPP32, the two enzymes that have previously been implicated in the activation of CPP32 (4Tewari M.

Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of purified CAP revealed that CAP is derived from the hamster homolog of Mch2α, a member of the ICE family recently cloned by PCR based on sequence conservation of the ICE family (17Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742PubMed Google Scholar). Mch2α may represent the upstream protease acting on CPP32 and may initiate the ICE-like protease cascade leading to apoptosis. We also find that CAP activity is more sensitive to inhibition by CrmA than is CPP32, defining a new and more efficient target for CrmA blockage of the onset of apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral Methods and MaterialsWe obtained male Golden Syrian hamsters (~150 g) from Sasco (Omaha, NE); [35S]methionine was from Amersham Corp.; N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), iodoacetamide (IAA), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), imidazole, and aprotinin were from Sigma; Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-YVAD-CHO) were from Bachem Bioscience, Inc.; Ac-Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEAD-CHO) was from Julio C. Medina of Tularik, Inc. (7Wang X. Pai J. Wiedenfeld E.A. Medina J.C. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE and gel-filtration chromatography were from Bio-Rad. cDNA clones of human SREBP-2 and hamster CPP32 were described in the indicated references. HeLa cell cytosol was prepared as described (13Wang X. Sato R. Brown S.M. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Silver staining was carried out using a Silver Stain Plus kit from Bio-Rad. Plasmids were purified using a Megaprep kit from Qiagen.In Vitro Translation of SREBP-2, CPP32, and CrmASREBP-2 was translated in a TNT SP6 transcription/translation kit from Promega as described (7Wang X.

A PCR fragment encoding amino acids 29-277 of hamster CPP32 (5Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) was cloned into NdeI and BamHI sites of pET 15b vector (Novagen). The resulting fusion protein of six histidines with hamster CPP32 (amino acids 29-277) was translated in a TNT T7 transcription/translation kit in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instruction. The translated protein was passed through a 1-ml nickel affinity column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 6.8, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na-EDTA, 1 mM Na-EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1 mM PMSF). After washing the column with 10 ml of buffer A, the translated CPP32 was eluted with buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole. CrmA cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene) and translated in a TNT T3 transcription/translation kit in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translated CrmA (200 µl) was purified by passing the translation mixture through a 10-ml Sephadex G-25 gel-filtration column equilibrated with buffer A. The translated proteins contained within the exclusion volume of the column were collected.Assay for CPP32-activating Protease10 µl of purified, 35S-labeled, in vitro translated hamster CPP32 was incubated at 37°C for various times with the indicated enzyme fractions in a final volume of 25 µl of buffer A. At the end of the incubation, SDS sample buffer was added to each tube. After boiling for 3 min, the samples were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and exposed to a Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film.Purification of CAP from Hamster LiverAll purification steps were carried out at 4°C. All the chromatography steps except the SP-Sepharose column were carried out using an automatic fast protein liquid chromatography station (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).Step 1: Preparation of S-100 FractionLivers from 25 hamsters were rinsed twice with cold buffer A and homogenized for 45 s in the same buffer (0.5 g/ml) in a Waring blender followed by three strokes of a motor-driven homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 105× g for 1 h in a SW 28 rotor (Beckman). The resulting supernatant (S-100) fraction was dialyzed overnight against three changes of 4 liters of buffer A.Step 2: SP-Sepharose ChromatographyThe S-100 fraction from step 1 was applied to a SP-Sepharose column (200 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. The flow-through fraction was supplemented with DTT to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubated at 30°C for 2 h before being loaded onto a fresh SP-Sepharose column (100 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with 4-column volumes of buffer A, the column was eluted with buffer A containing 400 mM NaCl.Step 3: Ammonium Sulfate PrecipitationSolid ammonium sulfate was added to the SP-Sepharose column eluate (150 ml) to 40% saturation. After stirring for 1 h, the precipitate was collected by centrifigation at 15,000 rpm in a JA 20 rotor (Beckman) for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A.Step 4: Superdex-200 Gel-filtration ChromatographyThe resuspended ammonium sulfate pellet was loaded onto a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Phamacia, 300 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and fractions of 10 ml were collected and assayed for CAP activity.Step 5: Mono Q ChromatographyThe active fractions from Superdex 200 column were pooled and loaded onto a Mono Q 5/5 column after adjusting the pH to 7.6 with 1 M KOH. The column was equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A adjusted to pH 7.6) and eluted with buffer B containing 400 mM NaCl. The flow-through and the bound materials were assayed for CAP activity.Step 6: Heat TreatmentThe flow-through fraction from the Mono Q column was adjusted to pH 6.8 with 1 N HCl followed by incubation at 55°C for 15 min. The denatured proteins were pelleted by centrifigation at 15,000 rpm in a JA 20 rotor for 20 min.Step 7: Mono S ChromatographyThe supernatant after heat treatment was loaded onto a Mono S 5/5 column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with a 20-ml linear salt gradient of buffer A to buffer A containing 440 mM NaCl. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed for CAP activity.NH2-terminal Sequencing Analysis of CAPThe CAP peak fractions from Mono S column (step 7) were subjected to electrophoresis in a 15% SDS gel and then transferred onto a piece of poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore). The 19- and 13-kDa subunits were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and excised for direct NH2-terminal sequencing on a sequencer (Biosystem).Western Blot AnalysisA polyclonal antibody against hamster CPP32 was produced as described (5Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against human CPP32 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Immunoblot analysis of CPP32 was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (13Wang X. Sato R. Brown S.M. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of Recombinant His6-tagged CPP32 and CrmAThe plasmid containing fusion protein of six histidine and hamster CPP32 (amino acid 29-277) was the same as used for the in vitro translation described above. The plasmid was transformed into DE3 competent cells (Novagen). The entire coding sequence of CrmA was PCR-amplified from the plasmid p996 containing cowpox virus crmA gene and cloned into the SalI and HindIII sites of pQE 30 vector (Qiagen). The plasmid was transformed into the M15 competent cells (Qiagen). The bacteria cultures (1 liter for each plasmid) were grown at 37°C until the density reach A600 reading of 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was then added to the final concentration of 2 mM. After 1-h induction, the bacteria were pelleted and lysed in buffer A through sonication. After centrifigation, the supernatants were loaded onto two 3-ml nickel-Sepharose (Qiagen) columns equilibrated with buffer A. The columns were washed with 10 ml of buffer A, followed by 10 ml of buffer A containing 500 mM NaCl, and again with 10 ml of buffer A. The fusion proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole. The peak protein fractions of the nickel column eluates were further purified through a FPLC Superdex-200 16/30 column equilibrated with buffer A, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The column fractions of the recombinant CPP32 were assayed for its enzymatic activity by incubating with 35S-labeled SREBP-2 as described previously (7Wang X. Pai J. Wiedenfeld E.A. Medina J.C.

The purity of recombinant CPP32 enzyme and CrmA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining.

First, CPP32 is closely related to an apoptosis promoting gene (ced-3 of Caenorhabditis elegans) in terms of both sequence similarity and substrate specificity (1Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G.

Second, CPP32 activity is markedly elevated in cells undergoing apoptosis induced by a variety of reagents (3Nicholson W.D. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y.

Third, a cowpox virus protein CrmA and a baculovirus protein p35, both of which prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis, inhibit the activity of CPP32 (2Xue D. Horvitz H.R.

Finally, a tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitor that specifically inhibits CPP32 activity also blocks the ability of cytosol from apoptotic cells to induce apoptosis-like changes in normal nuclei in vitro.

The proteolytic cleavage of PARP during the onset of apoptosis by CPP32 results in the separation of its DNA binding and catalytic domains. This cleavage prevents the catalytic domain of PARP from being recruited to sites of DNA damage and presumably disables the ability of PARP to coordinate subsequent repair and genome maintenance events (3Nicholson W.D. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulsom M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Ca2+/Mg2+- dependent endonuclease implicated in the internucleosomal DNA cleavage, a hallmark of apoptosis, is negatively regulated by polyADP-ribosylation, and this inhibition may be retrieved when PARP is cleaved (8Tanaka Y.

Such a protease cascade would provide both the regulation and signal amplification necessary for a highly controlled yet rapid and irreversible process of apoptosis.In this paper, we report the identification and purification of a CPP32-activating protease (CAP) from hamster liver extract. This enzyme specifically cleaves and activates CPP32. The biochemical properties of this protease suggest that it is an ICE-like cysteine protease distinct from ICE and CPP32, the two enzymes that have previously been implicated in the activation of CPP32 (4Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar, 5Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of purified CAP revealed that CAP is derived from the hamster homolog of Mch2α, a member of the ICE family recently cloned by PCR based on sequence conservation of the ICE family (17Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742PubMed Google Scholar). Mch2α may represent the upstream protease acting on CPP32 and may initiate the ICE-like protease cascade leading to apoptosis. We also find that CAP activity is more sensitive to inhibition by CrmA than is CPP32, defining a new and more efficient target for CrmA blockage of the onset of apoptosis."

Using a transgenic approach to specifically exchange β-Tm for the native α-Tm in mouse hearts, we have been able to uncover novel functions of Tm isoform switching in the heart. The myofilaments containing β-Tm demonstrated an increase in the activation of the thin filament by strongly bound cross-bridges, an increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of steady state force, and a decrease in the rightward shift of the Ca2+-force relation induced by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. Our results are the first to demonstrate the specific effects of Tm isoform switching on mammalian thin filament activation in the intact lattice and suggest an important role for Tm in modulation of myofilament activity by phosphorylation of troponin.

To examine the importance of Ser202 in CPE function, several mutations in this position were generated (Pro202, Ala202, Gly202, and Phe202). When the mutant proteins were expressed in a Baculovirus system, both Phe202 and Pro202CPE were enzymatically inactive, were unable to bind to a substrate affinity column, and were not secreted from Sf9 cells. In contrast, Ala202CPE or Gly202CPE exhibited enzymatic properties similar to those of wild-type CPE and were secreted from Sf9 cells.When expressed in AtT-20 cells, a mouse pituitary-derived cell line, CPE with Pro202 and Phe202 were not secreted. Pulse-chase analysis with [35S]Met indicated that Pro202CPE was degraded in AtT-20 cells within several hours. This degradative process was blocked by incubation at 15°C but not by brefeldin A or by lysosomotrophic drugs. Pulse-chase analysis using dispersed pituitary cells from C57BLKS/Lt-Cpefat/Cpefat mutant mice shows similar results; Pro202-CPE produced in these cells was not secreted but rather was degraded within 5 h. Immunofluorescence analysis of epitope-tagged CPE revealed Ser202CPE to be present primarily in secretory vesicles, whereas Pro202CPE was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and not the secretory vesicle-like structures.

HeLa cells attach to a variety of substrata, but subsequent spreading is specific to a collagen or gelatin substratum (18Lu M.L. McCarron R.J. Jacobson B.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 873-883PubMed Google Scholar). The spreading of HeLa cells on a gelatin substratum is initiated by the clustering of collagen receptors, including β1 integrins that activate phospholipase A2 to produce arachidonic acid (16Auer K.L. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The released arachidonic acid is further metabolized by lipoxygenase to produce metabolites that induce the production of diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol production is correlated to an increase in membrane-bound PKC activity that occurs during the attachment phase of cell adhesion and prior to cell spreading. Inhibition of PKC blocks cell spreading, and the activation of PKC enhances it, indicating that PKC activity is required for cell spreading (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKC activation with phorbol ester overcomes the inhibition of cell spreading that is induced by blocking either arachidonic acid release or by lipoxygenase metabolite formation, indicating that PKC is a downstream second messenger in the regulation of HeLa cell spreading (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To date, it is not known which PKC isozymes are involved in adhesion of cells to the ECM. Protein kinase C is a family of related serine and/or threonine protein kinases that appears to play an important role in a variety of cellular responses. The multiple PKC isozymes may have different physiological roles as PKC isozymes display both common features and substantial differences in primary structure, enzymatic activities, tissue and intracellular distribution, and cofactor requirements (19Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). This study was performed to identify the PKC isozymes involved in the regulation of HeLa cell adhesion to a gelatin substratum. The data obtained indicate that among the PKCα, -γ, -ε, -ζ, -λ, and -ι isozymes expressed in HeLa cells, only the PKCε isozyme is activated during cell substratum adhesion as determined by the translocation of cytosolic PKC to the membrane fraction. HeLa-S3 cells were grown in suspension culture to midlog phase (2-4 × 105 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum. The cells used for attachment and spreading studies were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were seeded in 35- or 60-mm culture dishes covalently coated with type I gelatin as described previously (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Lu M.L. McCarron R.J. Jacobson B.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 873-883PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C prior to scoring for the percent of cells spread unless otherwise indicated. The percent of cells spread was calculated from the number of spread cells/total number of cells × 100 from ~200-300 cells in several microscopic fields of view using phase-contrast microscopy (17Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For the separation of PKC isozymes between the cytosol and the membrane, HeLa cells, either kept in suspension or plated on gelatin for the indicated periods, were scraped into buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 M sucrose, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors including 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml pepstatin). The cells were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h to sediment all membranes and the insoluble cytoskeletal components, e.g. actin filaments and microtubules (21Patton W.F. Dhank M. Jacobson B.S. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 85-91PubMed Google Scholar, 22Frazier W.A. Meyers-Hutchins B.L. Jamieson G.A. Galvin N.S. Elson E. Frazier B. Glaser L.

Proteins (25 µg) from cytosolic, membrane, or particulate fractions were separated on 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose sheet was blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. PKC isozymes such as α, β, γ, ε, θ, λ, and ι were detected with isozyme-specific anti-PKC monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), while δ and ζ isozymes were detected with polyclonal antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PKC antibodies that were bound to the proteins on the cellulose nitrate sheets were detected with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with peroxidase using the ECL system of Amersham Life Sciences Inc. We have previously shown that the activity of PKC in the membrane fraction of HeLa cells plated on a gelatin substratum is transiently increased with a time course where the greatest increase in activity occurred during the cell attachment phase of cell adhesion and prior to cell spreading (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Once cell spreading had ceased, the membrane-associated PKC activity decreased but without a return of activity to the cytosol. Treatment of cells with calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of PKC, blocks cell spreading (Fig. 1). In contrast, PKC-activating phorbol ester PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) enhances the rate of cell spreading (Fig. 1), as well as the extent to which the cells spread (Fig. 2). The results are consistent with our previous report (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), indicating that PKC activity is required for HeLa cell spreading on a gelatin substratum. However, which isozymes of PKC are responsible for inducing cell spreading has not been determined.Fig. 2Morphology of HeLa cells plated on a gelatin substratum. HeLa cells were plated on gelatin-coated culture dishes at 37°C for 5 min to allow attachment (A) or for 30 min in the absence (B) or presence (D) of 0.4 µM PMA to allow spreading. Alternatively, the cells were pretreated with 1 µM calphostin C for 5 min and plated on gelatin for 30 min (C). The photographs were taken at ×200 magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The expression of the different PKC isozymes in HeLa cells was determined by Western blotting with isozyme-specific antibodies. All of the antibodies recognized an immunoreactive band from the lysate of mouse brain as a positive control (Fig. 3). The antibodies against the PKCα, -γ, -ε, -ζ, -λ, or -ι isozymes also detected immunoreactive protein from HeLa cell lysates, indicating that these isozymes are expressed in HeLa cells. However, PKCβ, -δ, and -θ subspecies do not appear to be expressed at significant levels since the corresponding antibodies failed to detect any proteins from the HeLa cell lysate (Fig. 3). Maximally loading the gel lanes with 60 µg of protein and exposing the gels until the background made it questionable as to whether a minor band was present did not reveal a band indicative of PKAβ, and very faint bands were seen with anti-δ and anti-θ PKC (data not shown). At this time, we did not pursue a study of the translocation of the PKCδ and -θ isozymes because of the questionable nature of their existence in HeLa cells; however, it should not be ruled out that PKCδ and PKCθ are not in HeLa cells since they might be there albeit at very, very low levels compared with those of the other PKC isozymes found. The relative distribution of the PKC isozymes among the cytosolic, membrane, and particulate fractions was determined in cells that were either kept in suspension or spread on gelatin (Fig. 4). In suspension cells, PKCα was detected exclusively in the cytosolic fraction. The other PKC isozymes were mostly in the cytosolic fraction but with various amounts in the membrane fraction and even smaller amounts in the particulate fraction (Fig. 4). To further assess the function of the various PKC isozymes in HeLa cells, we determined whether cell spreading on a gelatin matrix or treating cells with the conventional PMA induced the translocation of the HeLa cell PKC isozymes from the cytosol to the membrane. In an effort to clearly demonstrate any changes in the relative amounts of each PKC isozyme in the cytosolic, membrane, and particulate fractions in response to cell spreading or PMA treatment, equal amounts of protein from cells that were either treated with PMA or allowed to spread were loaded on the same gels in lanes next to each other and immunoblotted under identical conditions. The treatment of suspension cells with 1 µM PMA induced the association of PKCα, -γ, and -ε primarily with the membrane fraction with concurrent losses from the cytosolic fraction. The distribution of PKCζ, -λ, and -ι appears to be unchanged upon PMA treatment (Fig. 4). PMA at 1 µM was not cytotoxic as indicated by trypan blue exclusion and confirmed the observation that this concentration of PMA increased the rate and extent of cell spreading on a gelatin matrix. The inactive ester of PMA, phorbol 20-oxo-20-deoxy 12-myristate 13-acetate (αPMA), was also evaluated as a control and found not to induce any change in the distribution of the PKCα, -γ, -ε, and -ζ isozymes among the cytosolic, membrane, and particulate fractions. When HeLa cells were allowed to spread on a gelatin substratum, the relative amounts of PKCα, -γ, -ζ, -λ, and -ι were not changed. However, the levels of PKCε in the cytosolic fraction were significantly reduced with a concomitant increase occurring in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4). The results suggest that PKCε, among the isozymes expressed in HeLa cells, is specifically translocated to the membrane fraction during cell spreading. To further evaluate which of the PKC isozymes is responsible for the regulation of HeLa cell adhesion to a gelatin substratum, cells that were either kept in suspension or plated on gelatin and allowed to spread for various time intervals were fractionated and analyzed for the PKC isozymes. The distribution of the PKCα, -γ, -ζ, -λ, and -ι isozymes between the cytosolic and membrane fractions appears to be unchanged during cell to substratum adhesion (Fig. 5). PKCε was the only isozyme that showed a significant reduction in the cytosolic fraction upon attachment to a gelatin substratum with corresponding increases in the membrane and particulate fractions (Fig. 5). Translocation of PKCε was not observed during the adhesion of HeLa cells to sulfonated or polylysine-coated culture dishes where cells nonspecifically attach but do not spread (data not shown). Since the activation of PKC involves the stable association of cytosolic PKC with the membrane, the results suggest that PKCε is specifically activated to regulate HeLa cell adhesion to a gelatin substratum. The involvement of PKC in cell to ECM adhesion has long been suggested from the observation that PKC-activating phorbol ester enhances the adhesion of various cells to the ECM and that inhibitors of PKC prevent the adhesion (23Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Grossi I.M. Fitzgerald L.A. Umbarger L.A. Nelson K.K. Diglio C.A. Taylor J.D. Honn K.V.

Direct evidence indicating that endogenous PKC activity modulates attachment and spreading of cells to an ECM comes from the adhesion of Chinese hamster ovary cells to a fibronectin substratum (9Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of HeLa cells to a collagen substratum (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In both cell lines, PKC activity in a membrane fraction is transiently increased, and the inhibition of endogenous PKC activity blocks adhesion of the cells. While the above indicates that PKC is involved in regulating cell adhesion to an extracellular matrix, it is not known which isozymes are involved and whether the same isozymes function when phorbol ester is present. In the experiments reported here, only PKCε was found to parallel the translocation of total PKC enzymatic activity from cytosol to membrane as previously seen (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Before the cells attached to a gelatin matrix, no detectable PKC activity was observed in the membrane fraction. Upon cell attachment to a gelatin matrix, essentially all of the PKC enzymatic activity translocated from the cytosol to the membrane and occurred before the cells began to spread. When the cells finished spreading, the PKC activity in the membrane fraction began to decrease. Fig. 5 indicates that PKCε, as determined by immunoblotting, also follows a similar pattern of translocation as the activity measurements did (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PKCε was primarily found in the cytosolic fraction of cells prior to its attachment to a gelatin matrix. Within the first 10 min of attachment, PKCε was totally lost from the cytosolic fraction and could be accounted for in the membrane and particulate fractions. As with the previous PKC enzymatic activity measurements (17Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), PKCε began to diminish in the membrane fraction when the cells finished spreading. The above strongly supports the conclusion that PKCε and not the other PKC isozymes is involved in HeLa cell attachment and spreading on a gelatin matrix. Interestingly, small amounts of the PKC isozymes detected in HeLa cells other than PKCα were observed in the membrane and particulate fractions of cells in suspension. It is likely, however, that they were either enzymatically inactive or that their activity was insufficient to induce cell spreading. This is because the total PKC enzymatic activity in the membrane and particulate fraction as previously found (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was insignificant unless the cells had attached to the gelatin substratum and begun to spread. The increase in PKC enzymatic activity in HeLa cell membranes (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that appears to occur as a consequence of PKCε translocation from the cytosol during cell attachment to a gelatin matrix must result in the activation of the cytoskeletal machinery in order for cell spreading to occur (18Lu M.L. McCarron R.J. Jacobson B.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 873-883PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary work by us (data not shown) indicates that activation of PKC induces both the polymerization of actin and the up-regulation of β1-integrin receptors from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface in a microtubule-dependent manner. This implies that PKC might associate with both the microfilament- and microtubule-based cytoskeleton. To evaluate this possibility, we analyzed for the association of the HeLa cell PKC isozymes in three subcellular fractions (cytosolic, membrane, and particulate fractions) during cell adhesion to a gelatin matrix (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based upon previous work (21Patton W.F. Dhank M. Jacobson B.S. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 85-91PubMed Google Scholar, 22Frazier W.A. Meyers-Hutchins B.L. Jamieson G.A. Galvin N.S. Elson E. Frazier B. Glaser L. Cell Membranes, Methods and Reviews. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 1Crossref Google Scholar), the particulate fraction contains the cytoskeletal components. The only PKC isozyme that was found to translocate from the cytosolic fraction to the particulate (cytoskeletal) fraction during attachment and spreading on a gelatin matrix was the ε isozyme (Fig. 5). Several experiments indicate that the amount of PKCε translocated to the particulate (cytoskeletal) fraction was less than that translocated to the membrane fraction. Interestingly, all of the PKCs in HeLa cells except the α isozyme had small but significant amounts associated with the particulate fraction. However, only the ε isozyme exhibited an increase in the particulate (cytoskeletal) fraction during adhesion of the cells to gelatin. Many of the PKC isozymes exhibit individual characteristics (19Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Presently, 11 isozymes of PKC have been identified in mammalian tissues. These isozymes can be divided into four groups based on activation mechanisms: Ca2+-dependent classical or conventional PKCα, -β, and -γ; Ca2+-independent novel PKCδ, -ε, -θ, and -η; atypical PKCζ, -λ, and -ι; and PKCµ. In this study, we have shown that, among the expressed multiple PKC isozymes, PKCε is specifically activated during the attachment and spreading of HeLa cells on a gelatin substratum, as determined by the translocation of cytosolic PKC to the membrane fraction. Interestingly, other isozymes also appear to be able to function in HeLa cell spreading but only in response to the presence of an exogenously supplied activator such as the phorbol ester PMA. Both the α and γ isozymes in HeLa cells translocate from the cytosol to the membrane when the cells are in the presence of PMA (Fig. 4). Since all of the ε isozyme is translocated to the membrane and particulate fractions during HeLa cell adhesion to a gelatin matrix (Fig. 5), it is likely that the increase in rate and extent of cell spreading when PMA is present (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) are due to the translocation of the α and γ isozymes. PKCε, like all conventional and novel PKC isozymes, requires phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol for binding to the membrane and activation. However, PKCε, unlike the conventional PKCs, does not require elevation of Ca2+ for its activation (19Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism of PKCε is consistent with the signaling events observed during HeLa cell adhesion to a gelatin substratum. The level of diacylglycerol increases upon attachment and before spreading of HeLa cells, but the level of cytosolic free calcium does not change during cell attachment or cell spreading (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The absence of an increase in intracellular calcium also explains why PKCα and -γ are not translocated to the membrane during cell attachment and spreading, while the ε isozyme is translocated. It is generally accepted that the multiple PKC isozymes are responsible for different specialized physiological processes, and many cell types express the multiple PKC isozymes (19Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Among the multiple isozymes, the selective activation of PKCε has been reported in some cases such as insulin-mediated stimulation of PKCε in fetal chick neurons (26Heidenreich K.A. Toledo S.P. Brunton L.L. Watson M.J. Daniel-Issakani S. Strulovici B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15076-15082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and nerve growth factor-mediated activation in PC-12 cells (27Ohmichi M. Zhu G. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we have also shown that the selective activation of PKCε is most likely responsible for the regulation of HeLa cell adhesion to a gelatin matrix. It should be noted that the activation of PKCε is in part a downstream response to the clustering of β1-integrin collagen receptors by the gelatin matrix (16Auer K.L. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Currently, the action of PKCε in the regulation of adhesion of HeLa cell to ECM is not clarified. However, the activated PKC appears to regulate HeLa cell adhesion by dual pathways. One is through the formation of F-actin that is essential for cell spreading, and the other is by delivering integrin β1 to the cell surface where they can bind to the ECM molecules for optimum adhesion of cells. 2J-S.

We have previously reported that overexpression of IRS-1 may induce neoplastic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. This study examines the role of two SH2-containing molecules, namely the Grb2 adapter and Syp tyrosine phosphatase proteins as important components of the cellular transforming activity of IRS-1. Mutations of tyrosine 897 in the YVNI motif (Y897F) and of tyrosine 1180 in the YIDL motif (Y1180F) reduced the intracellular interaction of IRS-1 with Grb2 and Syp proteins, respectively. Furthermore, a single mutation at either Phe-897 or Phe-1180 substantially but not completely reduced IGF-I-dependent transforming activity of IRS-1, whereas creation of a double mutation of both tyrosine residues (Y897F/Y1180F) strikingly attenuated the transforming activity of IRS-1. Stable expression of the IRS-1 mutant constructs in NIH 3T3 cells was associated with a lower level of activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK)/MAPK cascade following IGF-I stimulation compared with cells stably transfected with the “wild-type” IRS-1 gene.

The overexpression of IGF-I and/or IGF-II proteins has been associated with several types of malignancies and, therefore, may contribute to carcinogenesis by autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms (4Macaulay V.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 311-320Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that the IGF-I receptor, a molecule that may be stimulated by IGF-I, IGF-II, and weakly by insulin, was overexpressed in several human malignancies including breast cancer and HCC (4Macaulay V.M.

We have found that one of the molecules up-regulated in HCC tumors at the protein and RNA level is the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), the main intracellular substrate of IGF-I/insulin receptors (8Myers Jr., M.G.

Cancer Lett. 1994; 84: 85-92Google Scholar). Although hIRS-1 is expressed at very low levels in normal hepatocytes (12Sasaki Y. Wands J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, there is direct evidence suggesting that tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 plays an important role in liver regeneration with respect to hepatocyte proliferation and growth (13Sasaki Y. Zhang X.F. Nishiyama M. Avruch J. Wands J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3805-3808Google Scholar). It is now well established that IRS-1 is tyrosyl-phosphorylated by cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases and subsequently interacts with SH2-containing molecules on phosphorylated tyrosine residues located in specific binding motifs as a mechanism to send the IGF-I/insulin signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. For example, the rat IRS-1 has a 895YVNI motif that binds the Grb2 adapter protein (or Ash) (14Baltensperger K. Kozma L.M. Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P.

In addition, the 1172YIDL interacts with the Syp phosphatase molecule (also known as PTP1D, PTP2C, and SH-PTP2) (16Kuhne M.R. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Google Scholar) and has several other YMxM/YxxM motifs that bind the p85 subunits of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) (17Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar, 18Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P.

Although the IRS-1 protein has no catalytic domain, it is apparent that following tyrosine phosphorylation IRS-1 may initiate the signal transduction process through its interaction with such SH2-containing molecules (8Myers Jr., M.G.

Indeed, previous reports have established that IRS-1-mediated mitogenic signals were regulated directly by this interaction with Grb2 and Syp, and such interactions were followed by the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) and MAPK cascade (18Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10350-10354Google Scholar, 19Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K.

It has also been suggested that constitutive activation of the MAPKK/MAPK cascade may be required for neoplastic transformation of mammalian cells to occur (23Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P.

Even though there is strong in vivo and in vitro evidence that indicates a close association between IRS-1 overexpression and hepatocarcinogenesis, the precise role of IRS-1 in the transformation process is unknown. It is of interest, however, that expression of IRS-1 antisense mRNA diminishes the mitogenic response of cells to insulin (25Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22231-22234Google Scholar), and overexpression of IRS-1 enhances the proliferative response in Chinese hamster ovary cells but not in a background of insulin receptor overexpression (26Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Google Scholar). We have previously reported that hIRS-1 overexpression may promote neoplastic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, and clones stably transfected with hIRS-1 exhibited the phenotypic properties of increased transformed foci formation, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and production of large tumors in nude mice (27Ito T. Sasaki Y. Wands J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 943-951Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported in NIH 3T3 cells with IGF-I receptor overexpression (5Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Google Scholar). To explore the potential molecular mechanisms of IRS-1 role in hepatocarcinogenesis, we examined the importance of interactions with the SH2-containing proteins, Grb2 and Syp, on cellular transforming activity and studied activation of the downstream MAPKK/MAPK cascade in response to IGF-I stimulation. We have isolated a hIRS-1 cDNA from a human HCC cell line (FOCUS), and this construct was used in the study (10Nishiyama M. Wands J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 280-285Google Scholar). Anti-IRS-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-Grb2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA), anti-Syp/PTP2C mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), and anti-p85 subunit of PI3K rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) were used for immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis. IGF-I was purchased from Sigma. For assays of MAPKK and MAPK enzymatic activity, we used recombinant MAPK protein conjugated to agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and myelin basic proteins (MBP, Sigma) as the specific substrates, respectively. The predicted structure of the hIRS-1 protein contains the same Grb2 and Syp binding motifs of 897YVNI and 1180YIDL, respectively, as the rat IRS-1 protein. Mutants of hIRS-1 were constructed by substitution of a TAT codon (tyrosine) with a TTT codon (phenylalanine) in these motifs by use of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (5′-GGGGGAATTTGTCAATA-3′ and 5′-GAATTTGTTAATATTG-3′, respectively), followed by certification of DNA sequences using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The cDNAs of hIRS-1 (wild type) and mutants (tyrosine 897 to phenylalanine and tyrosine 1180 to phenylalanine) were subcloned into the pBK-CMV expression vector (Stratagene), and designated as hIRS-1-wt, Phe-897, and Phe-1180, respectively. The double mutation of tyrosine 897 and 1180 was constructed by replacement of 3′-sequences coding Phe-897 by the same region of Phe-1180 using restriction enzymes NheI and EcoRI, and this construct was called Y897F/Y1180F (Fig. 1A). The expression plasmids were under control of a CMV promoter (hIRS-1-wt, Phe-897, Phe-1180, Y897F/Y1180F, and pBK-CMV (mock)) and linearized at the 3′-end of poly(A) signal sequences by MluI restriction enzymes followed by purification using Quiax DNA purification kit (Quiagen). NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) (Mediatech, Washington, DC) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma). In brief, 1 × 106 cells in 3.5-cm dish were transfected with 1 µg of linearized hIRS-1-wt, Phe-897, Phe-1180, Y897F/Y1180F, and pBK-CMV (mock) plasmids using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were split 1:10 at 2 days and grown confluently in 10% FBS/DMEM to characterize the transient transfectants. Stable transfected cells were established in the presence of G418 (400 µg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 colonies overexpressing hIRS-1 were pooled for the studies outlined below. For characterization of the phenotype, 1 × 106 pooled stable transfectants were seeded on 10-cm plastic dishes in DMEM with 10% FBS, and the cell growth rate was determined every day for 2 weeks. To examine exponential growth of the transfectants, 1 × 104 cells were seeded on 10-cm plastic dishes with DMEM and 10% FBS followed by replacement with DMEM containing various concentrations of FBS 24 h later. The growth of the hIRS-1 stable transfectants was then assessed by counting the number of cells. To determine transforming potential, the ability of established cells to exhibit anchorage-independent growth in soft agar was analyzed. For this assay 1 × 103 cells of each transfectant were seeded in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.4% soft agar (SeaPlaque GTG Agarose, FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) over a bottom agar containing medium consisting of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.53% agar. IGF-1 was added at 10 and 100 µg/ml. The numbers of colonies formed in soft agar was determined at 2 weeks after seeding as another assay for transforming activity. Cell lysates from the stable transfectants treated with 10% FBS for 10 min after 6 h of serum starvation were prepared in cold Triton-lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM Na4P2O7, 2 mM NaVO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mg/ml aprotinin, 3.5 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 25 mg/ml leupeptin). For immunoblot analysis, cell lysates containing 100 µg of protein were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The immunodetection was developed with the specific antibodies for proteins using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). To determine the interaction of IRS-1 with SH2-containing proteins, immunoprecipitation was performed using an antibody for the C terminus of hIRS-1 (amino acids 1230-43), and this antibody therefore does not affect the amino acid-897 and −1180 binding motifs. Cell lysates containing 500 µg of proteins were incubated with 1 µg of the IRS-1 antibody and immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose. The presence of SH2-containing proteins in the immunoprecipitants was immunodetected by antibodies specific for the proteins of interest using Western blot analysis. IGF-I-induced MAPKK and MAPK activation were analyzed using lysates of stable transfectants that were treated with or without 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 5 min after a 6-h serum starvation period. MAPKK activity was evaluated by measuring 32P incorporation into recombinant-human full-length p42 MAPK, as described previously (28Irie K. Gotoh Y. Yashar B.M. Errede B. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1994; 265: 1716-1719Google Scholar, 29Hu Q. Milfay D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1169-1174Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 µg of protein of each whole cell lysate in 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1.5 mM Na-EGTA, 100 µM NaVO4, 400 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mg/ml aprotinin, 3.5 mg/ml pepstatin A, 25 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM dithiothreitol was applied for detection of MAPKK activity. A 10-µl sample was mixed with 6 µl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing 50 µg/ml recombinant MAPK-glutathione-S-transferase protein conjugated to agarose beads plus 4 µl of 50 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30°C and washed first with lysis buffer, next with 0.5 M LiCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and then with 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM dithiothreitol, and 30 mM MgCl2. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, MAPK-glutathione-S-transferase bands were excised from the stained gels and counted by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). To exclude the activity exhibited by autophosphorylated recombinant enzyme, the lysis buffer was used as a control. Enzymatic activity of MAPK was measured according to previously described methods (8Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-293Google Scholar, 18Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10350-10354Google Scholar). Cell lysates with or without IGF-I stimulation were electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml MBP. Next, SDS was removed from the gels by washing with 20% 2-propanol in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h and then 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol for an additional 1 h at 20°C. After the enzyme in the gels was denatured by treatment with 6 M guanidine HCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 20°C and renatured in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.04% Tween 40 and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, the gel was preincubated in kinase buffer (40 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EGTA, 20 mM MgCl2) for 1 h at 25°C. Phosphorylation of MBP was performed by incubation of the gel with kinase buffer containing 25 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) for 1 h at 25°C. Then the gel was washed in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The locations corresponding to MAPK-phosphorylated MBP were determined using the autoradiographs, and relevant areas were cut and counted by a liquid scintillation counter. To clarify the effect of hIRS-1 overexpression in a well differentiated human hepatocyte-derived cell line, transfection experiments with wild-type or mutant hIRS-1 cDNAs were performed using the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2. In brief, 1 × 106 HepG2 cells were transfected with 1 µg of hIRS-1-wt, Y897F/Y1180F, and pBK-CMV (mock) circular plasmids. Two days later and after 6 h of serum starvation, transfected HepG2 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 5 min. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoblot analysis and MAPK enzymatic assays were performed as described above. The hIRS-1 protein is 90.5% homologous to the rat protein (10Nishiyama M. Wands J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 280-285Google Scholar) and contains the SH2-binding motifs of 897YVNI and 1180YIDL analogous to the 895YVNI and 1172YIDL motifs in rat IRS-1 that specifically binds to Grb2 and Syp, respectively. A diagram of the mutant hIRS-1 constructs is shown in Fig. 1A. Transfection of wild-type hIRS-1 (hIRS-1-wt) enhanced the interaction of both Grb2 and Syp in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2, B and D), and the levels of interaction correlated with the overexpression of IRS-1 as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). While there were no differences in the levels of expression of Grb2 among the transfectants (Fig. 2A), the mutant constructs Phe-897 and Y897F/Y1180F demonstrated a strikingly reduced interaction of IRS-1 with Grb2 protein (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the mutant hIRS-1 constructs Phe-1180 and Y897F/Y1180F exhibited reduced binding to Syp protein (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the same level of expression of Syp protein was found in all these hIRS-1 wild-type and mutant stable transfectants (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 1B, the levels of overexpression of IRS-1 in the cells transfected with the wild-type and mutant hIRS-1 constructs were equally increased compared with mock transfectants containing low levels of endogenous murine IRS-1. The p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase was expressed (Fig. 2E) and equally associated with wild-type and mutant IRS-1 proteins in all transfectants (Fig. 2F). The interaction of Grb2 and Syp with hIRS-1 was not affected by mutations at Phe-1180 and Phe-897, respectively (Fig. 2), and demonstrates that these binding motifs were specific for their target proteins. These NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing hIRS-1-wt, Phe-897, Phe-1180, and Y897F/Y1180F (Fig. 1) were characterized phenotypically and compared with mock transfectants. Observing confluent growth in 10% FBS/DMEM revealed that cells transiently transfected with hIRS-1-wt piled up into multi-layered cell structures and formed transformed loci within 2 weeks (84.8 ± 10.4 colonies/µg DNA). This aggregate formation of transformed foci was also recognized in cells transfected with the hIRS-1 Phe-897 or Phe-1187 mutant constructs, but the number of transformed foci tended to be less frequent (48.5 ± 7.7 and 44.3 ± 13.3 colonies/µg DNA, respectively) and smaller in size than hIRS-1-wt transfectants. In contrast, transient transfection of the double hIRS-1 mutant construct (Y897F/Y1180F) exhibited no multilayered and aggregated growth characteristics, and such cells were identical in appearance to the mock-transfected NIH 3T3 cells (0 colonies/µg DNA). The exponential growth of the stable transfectants were further characterized by changing the FBS concentrations. There was no difference in the number of G418-resistant colonies among the transfectants, and this finding indicates approximately the same DNA transfection efficiency in each experiment. Although the various hIRS-1 transfectants showed similar growth rates in DMEM with 20, 10, or 2% FBS additions (data not shown), cell growth varied significantly in 1% FBS/DMEM. NIH 3T3 cell lines stably transfected with hIRS-1-wt and mutant constructs had markedly different growth ability in 1% FBS as shown in Fig. 3. hIRS-1-wt transfectants displayed high growth rates during 8 days of culture, whereas the mutant hIRS-1 Phe-897- or Phe-1180-transfected cells showed reduced growth rates compared with hIRS-1-wt cells; mock transfectant cells could not grow under these low serum conditions. More important, the hIRS-1 Y897F/Y1180F double mutant construct exhibited a strikingly reduced growth rate and was similar to that observed with mock-transfected cells. For analysis of anchorage-independent growth of these stable transfectants, cells were plated on soft agar with 10% FBS, and colony formation was assessed at 2 weeks. Mock-transfected cells had no colony formation. In contrast, cells transfected with hIRS-1-wt, Phe-897, and Phe-1180 formed colonies in soft agar with 10% FBS at different levels. As shown in Fig. 4, hIRS-1-wt transfectants formed the highest levels at 16.2 ± 1.9 colonies per 1 × 103 cells; Phe-897 and Phe-1180 formed lower levels at 10.5 ± 1.5 and 7.5 ± 1 colonies, respectively. Addition of IGF-I resulted in approximately 2–3-fold increase in colony number indicating that hIRS-1-induced colony formation was mediated in part by IGF-I signals. In contrast, cells transfected with the hIRS-1 Y897F/Y1180F double mutant construct did not exhibit anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and only a few colonies were observed following IGF-I stimulation. These studies suggest that hIRS-1 overexpression induces cellular transformation, and this effect is augmented by IGF-I stimulation. A change in the cell phenotype, however, requires a hIRS-1 interaction with both Grb2 and Syp molecules. To analyze the potential signal transduction pathways promoting cellular transformation by hIRS-1 overexpression, the possible involvement of an IGF-I-dependent activation of MAPKK/MAPK cascade was examined. According to recent reports, constitutive activation of MAPKK/MAPK cascade was required for neoplastic transformation of mammalian cells to occur (23Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar, 24Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukusawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, all serum-starved cells exhibited equally low MAPKK enzymatic activity (40–45 cpm). IGF-I additions (100 ng/ml) induced significant MAPKK activation in hIRS-1-wt-transfected cells (330 ± 16 cpm); lower levels were observed in the Phe-897 (259 ± 12 cpm) and Phe-1180 (247 ± 11 cpm) mutant constructs. Such a significant enhancement of MAPKK activity by IGF-I stimulation, however, was not observed in the hIRS-1 Y897F/Y1180F double mutant-transfected cells (137 ± 12 cpm) or in the mock-transfected control cells (82 ± 6 cpm). Similar results were obtained with respect to MAPK activation, the downstream effector molecule of MAPKK. Fig. 6 demonstrates the MAPK activity following IGF-I stimulation. All unstimulated cells have equally low MAPK activity (72–81 cpm). In contrast, IGF-I stimulation enhanced MAPK activity in hIRS-1-wt transfectants (695 ± 21 cpm) but not in mock-transfected control cells (124 ± 16 cpm). In cells transfected with the mutant Phe-897 and Phe-1180 hIRS-1 constructs, the MAPK activity was reduced compared with hIRS-1-wt-transfected cells (578 ± 16 cpm and 498 ± 15 cpm, respectively). In contrast, the hIRS-1 double mutant Y897F/Y1180F transfectants demonstrated a limited capability to be stimulated by IGF-1 with respect to MAPK activity (210 ± 27 cpm). Our studies indicate that hIRS-1 overexpression will enhance IGF-I signaling effects. Maximal activation of the downstream MAPKK/MAPK cascade, however, requires hIRS-1 to interact with both Grb2 and Syp molecules. To determine the effect of hIRS-1 overexpression in a well differentiated human hepatocyte-derived cell line, the HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cell line which has a low level expression of endogenous hIRS-1 similar to that found in adult human hepatocytes was studied (10Nishiyama M. Wands J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 280-285Google Scholar, 11Furusaka A. Nishiyama M. Ohkawa K. Yamori T. Yonezawa K. Kasage M. Hayashi S. Tanaka T. Cancer Lett. 1994; 84: 85-92Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transfected with hIRS-1-wt, Y897F/Y1180F, and mock DNA and then incubated with or without IGF-I addition (100 ng/ml). As shown in Fig. 7A, immunoblot analysis revealed that the levels of hIRS-1 protein were equal in HepG2 cells transfected with either the hIRS-1-wt or Y897F/Y1180F mutant construct compared with the low level found in mock DNA-transfected cells. IGF-I stimulation induced MAPK activation in mock DNA-transfected HepG2 cells (277 ± 15 to 658 ± 23 cpm). In contrast, transfection with hIRS-1-wt strikingly enhanced IGF-I-dependent MAPK activity (240 ± 20 to 1541 ± 76 cpm). Transfection with the Y897F/Y1180F mutant construct reduced this IGF-1-stimulated MAPK activity in HepG2 cells (263 ± 17 to 703 ± 26 cpm) to levels observed in mock DNA-transfected control cells. This study indicates that IGF-I-dependent MAPK activity was enhanced by hIRS-1 overexpression in a well differentiated human hepatocyte-derived cell line, and this activation was mediated through the Grb2/Syp signaling pathway. Therefore, one of the possible cellular consequences of hIRS-1 overexpression during hepatocarcinogenesis may be an enhancement of IGF-I-dependent MAPK activation. Some of the general molecular mechanisms associated with neoplastic transformation has been linked to mitogenic signaling pathways coupled with constitutive activation of serine-threonine kinases such as MAPK (23Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar, 24Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukusawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar). MAPK is activated by the tyrosine/threonine kinase MAPKK, and it in turn has been previously activated by Raf-1-induced phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues (30Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Google Scholar). Raf-1 has been defined as an effector molecule for the Ras-GTP complex (31Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Google Scholar). This cascade is initiated by upstream growth factor receptors that subsequently undergo autophosphorylation upon binding to ligand by activation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (32Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of wild-type growth factor receptors such as epidermal growth factor (33Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Hazan R. Ullrich A. King C.R. Schlessinger J. Aaronson S.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 1063-1070Google Scholar) and IGF-I (5Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Google Scholar) will produce ligand-dependent cellular transformation. In addition, disruption of IGF-I receptor function has been found to subsequently inhibit v-ras-induced cellular transformation (7Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Google Scholar). Therefore, in certain circumstances neoplastic transformation requires intact signaling pathways for growth factor receptors such as IGF-I (2Beserga R. Cell. 1994; 79: 927-930Google Scholar). It has been observed that following ligand stimulation, the activated IGF-I receptor subsequently tyrosyl phosphorylates IRS-1 as its principal intracellular substrate (8Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-293Google Scholar, 9White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Google Scholar). As shown here, hIRS-1 overexpression induces cellular transformation in an IGF-I-dependent manner and suggests that IRS-1 signaling pathways may be involved as a general mechanism of cellular transformation in the liver. IRS-1 lacks a catalytic domain but possesses several SH2-binding motifs that interact with downstream signal transduction molecules such as Grb2, Syp, PI3K, and Nck (8Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-293Google Scholar). To address the putative role of these signal transduction molecules in hIRS-1-induced cellular transformation, the interaction of Grb, Syp, and PI3K with hIRS-1 was analyzed in NIH 3T3 cells. In this regard, Grb2, a 23-kDa SH2-SH3-containing protein, binds to a phosphotyrosine residue in the YVNI motif on IRS-1 via its SH2 domain (14Baltensperger K. Kozma L.M. Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1950-1952Google Scholar, 15Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of Grb2 binds to a proline-rich region of son-of-sevenless (Sos) protein recently characterized as a Ras-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor (23Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar, 24Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukusawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar). The Grb2-Sos complex is brought to the cell surface membrane where Sos interacts with Ras-GDP and subsequently catalyzes a GDP/GTP exchange on Ras, followed by activation of the downstream Raf/MAPKK/MAPK cascade (32Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar). Our study confirms that the 897YVNI motif in hIRS-1 was essential for the interaction with Grb2 (Fig. 2B), but the functional consequence of a single mutation of 897 tyrosine (Phe-897) resulted in a limited effect on either hIRS-1-induced cellular transformation or IGF-1-stimulated MAPKK/MAPK activation as compared with the hIRS-1-wt molecule. This observation is consistent with a previous report using a rat IRS-1 mutant construct that alters the Grb2-binding motif (34Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kitamura T. Hara K. Nakafuku Okabayashi Y. Kadowaki T. Kaziro Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4634-4640Google Scholar, 35Myers Jr., M.G. Wang L.-M. Sun X.J. Zhang Y. Yenush Schlessinger J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3577-3587Google Scholar). Recently, the SH2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase Syp has been identified as a positive effector for the Ras-signaling pathway (19Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Google Scholar, 20Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Google Scholar, 22Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Google Scholar). As shown in the present report a single mutation of 1180YIDL in the Syp-binding domain (Phe-1180) partially but not completely inhibited the transforming potential of hIRS-1-wt and IGF-I-stimulated activation of the MAPKK/MAPK cascade. Li et al. (36Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Google Scholar) have revealed that phosphorylation of Syp on a tyrosine residue allows it to act as an adapter protein between the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the Grb2-Sos complex. IGF-I and insulin receptors, however, do not tyrosyl phosphorylate Syp as a direct substrate, and phosphorylated Syp has not been detected after IGF-I or insulin stimulation of cells (21Milarski K. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Google Scholar, 36Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Google Scholar). 2S. Tanaka, T. Ito, and J. R. Wands, unpublished data. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the Phe-1180 hIRS-1 mutant decreases the specific interaction with Syp (D) but does not affect the interaction with Grb2 (B), suggesting that other possible proteins contribute to the mitogenic signaling pathways via a hIRS-1/Syp interaction, rather than a complex formation through Syp-Grb2-Sos. In addition, a recent report has shown that a catalytically inactive Syp (21Milarski K. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Google Scholar) inhibits MAPK activity. Thus the catalytic substrate(s) of Syp phosphatase could play an important role in regulating mitogenic signals although the target substrate(s) have yet to be identified. IRS-1 is one of the major intracellular substrates of IGF-I and insulin receptors, and such receptors probably directly interact with the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of IRS-1 (38Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar). The Shc protein has recently been identified as another substrate of these receptor tyrosine kinases (38Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar, 39Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Google Scholar). Shc also has a PTB (N terminus) and SH2 (C terminus) domains, and, using either or both of these regions, Shc may interact with various growth factor receptors (38Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar, 40Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G.

However, Shc contains only one SH2 binding motif, namely 317YVNV that could interact with Grb2 (42Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836Google Scholar). Interestingly, Shc overexpression also induces cellular transformation similar to what we have found with hIRS-1 (40Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Google Scholar), possibly due to amplification of cellular growth signals through Shc or IRS-1. Salcini et al. (42Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836Google Scholar) suggests that the interaction of Shc with Grb2 was necessary for Shc-induced transformation to occur. In the present report, we found that the interaction of IRS-1 with Grb2 was insufficient to explain hIRS-1-induced cellular transformation. Indeed, the double mutation of both Grb2 and Syp binding sites (Y897F/Y1180F) was required to substantially reduce IGF-I-induced colony formation in a soft agar as a measurement of the transformed phenotype. In addition, the Y897F/Y1180F mutant construct clearly reduced IGF-I-stimulated MAPKK/MAPK activation in both NIH 3T3 and HepG2 cells compared with hIRS-1-wt-transfected cells. Cellular transformation induced by IRS-1 overexpression therefore requires an interaction with Grb2 and Syp molecules, and a maximal level of cellular transformation requires both interactions. IGF-I signals have been found necessary for neoplastic transformation to occur in vitro (5Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Google Scholar) as well as to promote tumorgenicity in vivo (43Prager D. Li H.L. Asa S. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2181-2185Google Scholar). We are led to believe that this cellular transformation pathway may be specifically mediated through IRS-1. Indeed, hIRS-1 overexpression in human hepatocytes may induce significant enhancement of IGF-I-dependent MAPK activation through Grb2/Syp signaling pathways as shown here by studies with the well differentiated HepG2 human hepatocyte-derived cell line. There is the possibility that hIRS-1-induced MAPK/MAPKK activation is not always related to an interaction with Grb2 and Syp proteins. IRS-1 is known to contain other SH2 binding motifs that interact with downstream effector molecules such as PI3K and Nck (17Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M.

Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Google Scholar, 46Chou M.M. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5834-5842Google Scholar), and a recent report demonstrated that Nck SH3 domains bind to Sos and may induce Ras-signaling pathways (29Hu Q. Milfay D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1169-1174Google Scholar). Such studies begin to address the possible molecular mechanisms of hIRS-1-induced cellular transformation and its potential role in hepatocarcinogenesis."

We demonstrated previously that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 down-regulates inducible NOS after its induction by interleukin (IL)-1β by decreasing the rate of inducible NOS gene transcription. In the present study we transfected reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the inducible NOS 5′-flanking region into primary cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells and stimulated the cells with IL-1β or vehicle. IL-1β increased the activity of the plasmid containing −1485 to +31 of the inducible NOS gene by more than 10-fold, indicating the presence of IL-1β-responsive elements. Further deletion analysis revealed that a construct containing −234 to +31 of the inducible NOS gene contained the majority of promoter/enhancer activity after IL-1β stimulation. Mutation of the NF-κB site within this region partially reduced IL-1β-inducible activity; however, a large portion of activity remained independent of the NF-κB site. TGF-β1 suppressed promoter/enhancer activity after IL-1β stimulation, and this suppression was complete in the construct with a mutated NF-κB site. In addition, TGF-β1 did not decrease the binding of nuclear proteins to the NF-κB site. These data suggest that the ability of TGF-β1 to suppress inducible NOS promoter/enhancer activity occurs through a site(s) other than the NF-κB motif in vascular smooth muscle cells.

The inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS) is present in many cell types, and the induction of iNOS is regulated at the level of gene transcription (4Xie Q.-W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the ability of interferon-γ to synergistically induce iNOS in the presence of LPS requires binding of interferon regulatory factor-1 to its binding site (interferon regulatory factor-E) in the iNOS promoter (10Martin E.

An important cytokine-mediated disease linked to the induction of iNOS is septic shock (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kilbourn R.G.

The resistance of mice carrying a disrupted iNOS gene to LPS-induced death emphasizes the potential importance of NO in septic shock (13MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S.

Because vascular smooth muscle cells are critical for regulation of vascular tone, the induction of iNOS within these cells may have a particularly important role in the pathogenesis of septic shock. We have previously demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, two important cytokines downstream of endotoxin in the cascade of events leading to septic shock (15Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar, 16Epstein F.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), induce iNOS mRNA by increasing gene transcription in vascular smooth muscle cells (5Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 down-regulates iNOS after its induction by IL-1β by decreasing the rate of iNOS gene transcription. Different from its effect on vascular smooth muscle cells, the effect of TGF-β1 on macrophage iNOS occurs post-transcriptionally (17Vodovotz Y. Bogdan C. Paik J. Xie Q.-W. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Another important difference exists between vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages in regard to iNOS regulation by cytokines. In macrophages, an NF-κB site located in the downstream portion of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence (−85GGGACTCTCC−76, NF-κBd) is necessary for induction of iNOS by bacterial LPS (8Xie Q.-W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Xie and colleagues (8Xie Q.-W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also noted that a large transcription factor complex bound to an oligonucleotide probe constructed from the iNOS promoter containing the NF-κBd site plus the next 47 bp downstream. The binding of this transcription factor complex to the iNOS probe was dependent upon the synthesis of newly formed protein(s) in response to LPS. In contrast, the induction of iNOS mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells by cytokines such as IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α is protein synthesis-independent (5Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in protein synthesis dependence suggests that important differences exist in regulation of the iNOS gene in vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages. We designed the present studies to determine the role of NF-κB in the induction of iNOS by IL-1β in vascular smooth muscle cells and to determine whether TGF-β1 suppresses iNOS promoter/enhancer activity through inhibition of NF-κB. Using reporter gene transfection experiments in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC), we found that the majority of IL-1β-responsive activity is contained in bp −234 to +31 of the iNOS gene, and a notable portion of iNOS inducibility is independent of NF-κB. The TGF-β1-responsive elements accountable for the suppression of IL-1β-induced iNOS activity exist in region −234 to +31 of the 5′-flanking sequence, and the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 occurred through a site(s) other than NF-κBd. RASMC were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 grams) by enzymatic dissociation according to the method of Gunther et al. (18Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) (Sigma). RASMC were passaged every 4-7 days, and experiments were performed on cells 4-6 passages from primary culture. To assure the lack of endotoxin contamination within our cell culture system, assays were performed using a modified Limulus Amebocyte Lysate system (BioWhittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD). A fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse gene encoding iNOS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers were designed according to the published sequence of the mouse iNOS 5′-flanking sequence (7Xie Q.-W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). The forward (5′-TCTAAGCTTTTGTTTCCCAGGT-3′) and reverse (5′-AGTCTCGAGTCTTCAACTCCCTGTA-3′) primers were used to amplify a 1,516-bp fragment from mouse genomic DNA. The PCR fragment was subcloned, and the sequence was verified by the dideoxy chain termination method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids pGL2-Basic, pGL2-Control, and pGL2-Promoter contained the firefly luciferase gene (Promega, Madison, WI). pGL2-Basic had no promoter, pGL2-Control contained the SV40 promoter and enhancer inserted into pGL2-Basic, and pGL2-Promoter contained only the SV40 promoter inserted into pGL2-Basic. Plasmid pCAT-Control contained the prokaryotic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (Promega) driven by the SV40 promoter and enhancer. Reporter constructs containing fragments of the mouse iNOS 5′-flanking sequence were named according to the location of the fragment from the transcription start site in the 5′ and 3′ directions. The 1,516-bp fragment amplified from mouse genomic DNA, containing 1485 bp of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence and the first 31 bp after the transcription start site, was named iNOS(−1485/+31). To provide localization of potential cis-acting elements responsible for IL-1β induction of smooth muscle cell iNOS, we generated a series of truncated iNOS 5′-flanking fragments using PCR techniques. Constructs containing these 5′ deleted fragments were named iNOS(−1209/+31), iNOS(−815/+31), iNOS(−518/+31), and iNOS(−234/+31). All of the aforementioned reporter constructs were inserted into pGL2-Basic. The construct containing bp −1485 to +31 was also inserted into pGL2-Basic in the reverse orientation, and this construct was named iNOS(+31/−1485 R). Another PCR-generated fragment of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence, containing bp −234 to −53, was inserted into pGL2-Promoter to assess its effects on heterologous promoter activity in the presence of IL-1β. This construct was named iNOS(−234/−53). All of the constructs were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to confirm the orientation and sequence of the insert. 3 bp within the NF-κBd site were mutated (−85 to −83, GGG to CTC) using a PCR site-directed mutagenesis technique (20Higushi R. Krummel B. Saiki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar, 21Lee M.-E. Dhadly M.S. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Yoshizumi M. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19034-19039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These 3 bp were selected because they are essential for nuclear protein binding (8Xie Q.-W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J.

The constructs containing the mutated NF-κBd site, iNOS(−1485/+31 NF-κBm) and iNOS(−331/+31 NF-κBm), were inserted into pGL2-Basic, and their orientation and sequences were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RASMC were transfected by a DEAE-dextran method. In brief, 500,000 cells were plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow for 48-72 h (until 80-90% confluent). 5 µg each of luciferase plasmid DNA and pCAT-Control (to correct for differences in transfection efficiency) were added to RASMC in a solution containing 500 µg/ml of DEAE-dextran. RASMC were subsequently shocked with a 5% Me2SO solution for 1 min and then allowed to recover in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 12 h after transfection, RASMC were placed in 2% fetal calf serum. The RASMC were stimulated with vehicle, human recombinant IL-1β (10 ng/ml) (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA), or a combination of IL-1β and simian recombinant TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) (gift of Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, WA) for 48 h. We chose these doses of IL-1β and TGF-β1 based on data from our previous studies (5Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared by a detergent method (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured in duplicate for all samples using an EG&G AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Gaithersburg, MD) and the Promega Luciferase Assay system. The CAT assay was performed with a modified two-phase fluor diffusion method as described previously (24Lee M.-E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fen Z. Dhadly M.S. Yoshizumi M. Hilkert R.J. Quertermous T. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Lee M.-E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7932-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase to CAT activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (21Lee M.-E. Dhadly M.S. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Yoshizumi M. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19034-19039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The probe consisted of annealed synthetic complementary oligonucleotides encoding two tandem NF-κBd sites (GGGACTCTCCCCTCTCAGGG). Prior to annealing, the oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim). A typical binding reaction contained 20,000 cpm DNA probe, 0.1 µg of poly(dI-dC)·;5poly(dI-dC), 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 40 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 9 µg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 25 µl. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and fractionated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 1 × TAE (40 mM Tris base, 20 mM acetic acid, 2 mM EDTA) recirculating buffer system. To determine the specificity of the DNA-protein complexes, competition assays were performed using 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding NF-κBd (specific inhibitor), or a 100-fold molar excess of an unrelated double-stranded oligonucleotide of comparable length (nonspecific inhibitor). Comparisons between groups were made by factorial analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference test when appropriate. IL-1β (10 ng/ml) increased the luciferase activity of plasmid iNOS(−1485/+31) by more than 10-fold (p < 0.05) in primary cultured RASMC (Fig. 1). The luciferase activity produced by iNOS(−1485/+31) in the presence of IL-1β is comparable with that produced by pGL2-Control, which is driven by the potent SV40 enhancer and promoter. The plasmid iNOS(+31/−1485 R), containing the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence inserted into pGL2-Basic in the reverse orientation, produced minimal luciferase activity, and it was not responsive to IL-1β stimulation. We next transfected RASMC with a series of 5′-truncated promoter/enhancer constructs to localize the IL-1β-responsive element(s) within the iNOS 5′-flanking region. A plasmid containing bp −234 to +31 of the iNOS gene (iNOS(−234/+31)) contained nearly as much luciferase activity as iNOS(−1485/+31) after stimulation with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β (Fig. 2). This suggests that the majority of IL-1β-responsive activity resides between bp −234 and +31 of the iNOS gene. The fragment from bp −234 to −53 was inserted 5′ to the heterologous SV40 promoter of plasmid pGL2-Promoter and transfected into RASMC. This construct (iNOS(−234/−53)) produced a greater than 2-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with pGL2-Promoter alone when exposed to IL-1β (p < 0.05), confirming the presence of IL-1β-responsive elements in the downstream portion of the iNOS 5′-flanking region. To determine the importance of the NF-κB site located in the downstream portion of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence (NF-κBd, −85 to −76) and to determine if sites other than NF-κBd may be important for the activation of iNOS by IL-1β in vascular smooth muscle cells, we mutated three bp (−85 to −83, GGG to CTC) within the NF-κBd site that are required for nuclear protein binding (8Xie Q.-W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ghosh G. Van Duyne G. Ghoch S. Sigler P.B.

This plasmid (iNOS(−1485/+31 NF-κBm)) was transfected into RASMC, and its ability to induce luciferase activity after IL-1β stimulation was compared with iNOS(−1485/+31), which contained an intact NF-κBd site. IL-1β (10 ng/ml) induced an 11-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells transfected with iNOS(−1485/+31) (Fig. 3A). When the NF-κBd site was mutated, luciferase activity after IL-1β stimulation was reduced compared with iNOS(−1485/+31) (p < 0.05); however, a large portion of iNOS inducibility remained independent of NF-κBd (45%) in the transfected vascular smooth muscle cells. To exclude the possibility that the upstream NF-κB site (−971 to −962) adopted the activity of the mutated NF-κBd site, we generated a second NF-κBd mutant that had the upstream portion of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence deleted (iNOS(−331/+31 NF-κBm)). When compared with iNOS(−1485/+31 NF-κBm), iNOS(−331/+31 NF-κBm) demonstrated no difference in luciferase activity after IL-1β stimulation (p = 0.154) (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that neither the upstream NF-κB site (−971 to −962) nor the 5′-flanking sequence (bp −1485 to −332) were responsible for the iNOS promoter/enhancer activity remaining after mutation of NF-κBd. Thus, a site(s) other than NF-κBd within the −331 to +31 region of the iNOS gene is important for iNOS induction by IL-1β in vascular smooth muscle cells. To examine the effect of TGF-β1 on iNOS promoter/enhancer activity and to localize the site of TGF-β1-responsive element(s), we transfected RASMC with the same 5′-truncated constructs as described for Fig. 2. The constructs were stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) in the presence or the absence of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). TGF-β1 suppressed luciferase activity by 60% in cells transfected with plasmid iNOS(−234/+31) (p < 0.05), which is not different from the reduction in luciferase activity noted in all of the more 5′ plasmid constructs (Fig. 4). These data suggest that TGF-β1-responsive element(s) responsible for the suppression of IL-1β-induced iNOS promoter/enhancer activity exist between bp −234 and +31 in the iNOS 5′-flanking region. In addition, TGF-β1 did not suppress iNOS promoter/enhancer activity in the absence of IL-1β (data not shown), confirming that the response of reporter genes to TGF-β1 was not a nonspecific effect of TGF-β1 on reporter activity. We next transfected RASMC with plasmid iNOS(−1485/+31 NF-κBm) and assessed luciferase activity after stimulation with vehicle, IL-1β alone (10 ng/ml), or a combination of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) and TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). As shown previously (Fig. 3), IL-1β increased luciferase activity in the presence of a mutated NF-κBd site (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). When TGF-β1 was administered in combination with IL-1β, the induction of luciferase activity was completely inhibited. Thus, inhibition of luciferase activity by TGF-β1 was complete (100%) in the presence of a mutated NF-κBd site (iNOS −1485/+31 NF-κBm)) and partial (60%) in the presence of an intact NF-kBd site (iNOS(−1485/+31)). To determine if TGF-β1 could inhibit nuclear protein binding to the NF-κB site, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a probe made from annealed synthetic complementary oligonucleotides encoding NF-κBd. Incubation of the labeled NF-κBd probe with nuclear extract prepared from RASMC stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) resulted in the formation of a DNA-protein complex indicated by the arrow in Fig. 6. The intensity of this complex was much greater than the barely detectable band noted in nuclear extract from RASMC exposed to vehicle. This DNA-protein complex was specific because a 100-molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide encoding NF-κBd, but not an unrelated oligonucleotide competed for nuclear protein binding and abolished the presence of the retarded complex. Incubation of the labeled NF-κBd probe with nuclear extract from RASMC stimulated with a combination of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) and TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml, a dose shown to suppress iNOS promoter/enhancer activity) also resulted in the formation of a specific DNA-protein complex. This complex was of similar intensity as the band produced by nuclear extract from RASMC stimulated with IL-1β alone. These data, together with the transfection studies, indicate that TGF-β1 did not decrease nuclear protein binding to the NF-κBd site and that TGF-β1 inhibited iNOS promoter/enhancer activity through a site(s) other than NF-κBd. An important aspect of our study was to investigate the regulation of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence in primary cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, which may differ from iNOS regulation in cell lines. Previous studies have demonstrated that the downstream NF-kBd site (−85 to −76) was necessary for iNOS inducibility by LPS in a macrophage-like cell line (RAW 264.7) (7Xie Q.-W. Whisnant R. Nathan C.

Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Using multiple cytokine stimulation (IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ), these investigators (27Spink J. Cohen J. Evans T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29541-29547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) reported the upstream NF-κB site (−971 to −962) may play a role in the regulation of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence in A7r5 cells. However, vascular smooth muscle cells differ from macrophage-like cells in regard to iNOS regulation (5Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and primary cultured smooth muscle cells differ markedly from A7r5 cells in their response to cytokines (e.g. A7r5 cells are resistant to iNOS mRNA induction by IL-1β). 2M. A. Perrella and M.-E. Lee, unpublished observation. Our data support the significance of the NF-κBd site, but more importantly the data suggest that a site(s) other than NF-κBd in the downstream portion of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence (−234 to +31) is critical for iNOS induction in primary cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. We have shown previously that TGF-β1 down-regulated iNOS mRNA after its induction by IL-1β in vascular smooth muscle cells (5Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This down-regulation occurred at the transcriptional level, resulting in a 65% reduction in the rate of iNOS transcription by TGF-β1. We demonstrate in the present study a comparable 60% reduction in IL-1β-induced iNOS promoter/enhancer activity by TGF-β1 (Fig. 4). Kerr and colleagues (29Kerr L.D. Miller D.B. Matrisian L.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 267-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) have identified a specific sequence within the 5′-flanking region of several TGF-β1-inhibited genes that is required for TGF-β1 to have its inhibitory actions (29Kerr L.D. Miller D.B. Matrisian L.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 267-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This sequence, GNNTTGGTGA, is known as the TGF-β1 inhibitory element. Within the mouse iNOS 5′-flanking sequence, one complete TGF-β1 inhibitory element site (−1232 to −1223) exists. However, after deletion of the upstream 5′ portion of the flanking sequence (−1485 to −1210), cells transfected with plasmid iNOS(−1209/+31) continued to respond to TGF-β1 (Fig. 4), demonstrating that this TGF-β1 inhibitory element site is not responsible for the inhibition of iNOS by TGF-β1. Our data indicate that the TGF-β1-responsive elements accountable for the suppression of IL-1β-induced iNOS activity exist in region −234 to +31 of the 5′-flanking sequence, and this inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 occurs through a site(s) other than NF-κBd in vascular smooth muscle cells. Because the NF-κBd site contributes to the induction of iNOS by IL-1β, TGF-β1 was not able to completely inhibit iNOS promoter/enhancer activity in the presence of an intact NF-κBd site. Our results are consistent with studies by Mauviel et al., which showed that TGF-β1 did not alter NF-κB-driven promoter activity, nor did it suppress cytokine-induced NF-κB binding in fibroblasts (30Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The inducible isoform of NO synthase is a complex gene that is regulated differently in vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages (5Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences may occur at a transcriptional level and may depend upon the usage of different cis-acting elements by vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages. Further studies to specifically localize the element(s) responsible for the action of IL-1β (up-regulation) and TGF-β1 (down-regulation) on iNOS promoter/enhancer activity in vascular smooth muscle cells will add to our understanding of iNOS gene regulation, particularly as it relates to the regulation of vascular tone. Moreover, these elements involved in the regulation of iNOS by IL-1β and TGF-β1 may be targets for smooth muscle cell-specific inhibition of the iNOS gene in a cytokine-driven disease process such as septic shock. We extend our gratitude to Dr. Edgar Haber for helpful suggestions and continued enthusiasm and support of our work. We also thank Dr. Edgar Haber and Yukari Yamashita for critical review of the manuscript, Dr. Allen Naftilan for advice regarding the use of DEAE-dextran for transfection experiments, and Bonna Ith for technical assistance."

https://openalex.org/W1986397901,"The histidine-binding protein, HisJ, is the soluble receptor for the periplasmic histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium. The receptor binds the substrate in the periplasm, interacts with the membrane-bound complex, transmits a transmembrane signal to hydrolyze ATP, and releases the ligand for translocation. HisJ, like other periplasmic receptors, has two lobes that are apart in the unliganded structure (open conformation) and drawn close together in the liganded structure (closed conformation), burying deeply the ligand. Such receptors are postulated to interact with the membrane-bound complex with high affinity in their liganded conformation, and, upon substrate translocation, to undergo a reduction in affinity and therefore be released. Here we show that in contrast to the current postulate, liganded and unliganded receptors have equal affinity for the membrane-bound complex. The affinity is measured both by chemical cross-linking and co-sedimentation procedures. An ATPase activity assay is also used to demonstrate the interaction of unliganded receptor with the membrane-bound complex. These findings support a new model for the transport mechanism, in which the soluble receptor functions independently of the commonly accepted high-low affinity switch."

The TNFR superfamily, of which the M-T2 protein is a member, is characterized by the presence of multiple cysteine-rich motifs of about 40 amino acids in their extracellular amino-terminal domain (36Armitage R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 37Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). M-T2 protein displays the greatest homology with the p75 TNFR (12Upton C. Macen J.L. Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1991; 184: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and thus rabbit TNFα and TNFβ would appear to be the most likely candidates for a biological target of M-T2 protein, although other members of the TNF superfamily, including FAS ligand and CD40 ligand cannot be excluded. The currently favored model is that M-T2 protein acts to inhibit host TNF responses by binding and sequestering either extracellular or cell surface TNF and thereby preventing the activation of cellular TNF receptors. Here we demonstrate that M-T2 protein specifically forms inhibitory complexes with rabbit TNFα and that binding is associated with the ability to inhibit the cytolytic activities of rabbit TNFα on susceptible rabbit and mouse cell lines. M-T2 protein is found to be secreted from virally infected cells as both a monomer and disulfide-linked dimer, both of which bind TNFα with similar affinities. Moreover, the dissociation constant (Kd) values for both monomeric and dimeric M-T2 protein, assessed by Scatchard analysis, compare favorably with those of other vertebrate TNFαs with their cognate receptors. However, the dimeric form of M-T2 is far more active than the monomeric form at inhibiting the cytolytic activities of TNFα, most likely because as a divalent inhibitor, the dimer can more effectively inhibit the ability of the TNFα trimeric ligand to induce oligermization of the cell surface TNF receptors.

Guilbert) were cultured in Iscove's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; and RL-5 cells (obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS research and Reference Reagent Program) were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The plasmid pMJ601T2RaTNF used to make a vaccinia virus that overexpresses secreted TNFα (VV-T2RaTNF) was constructed in which the rabbit TNFα cDNA sequence was placed downstream of the vaccinia synthetic late promoter (40Davison A.J. Moss B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4285-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) after the secretory leader sequence of rabbit TNFα had been replaced in frame with the secretory leader sequence of the M-T2 protein (see Fig. 1A). The plasmid pUCRaTNF (18Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1994; 204: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction amplification of the mature rabbit TNF sequence using the primer 5′-TGCGTATACGGGCTCAGATCAGCTTCTCGGGCC containing sequence from the M-T2 leader region immediately upstream of sequence encoding the 5′-terminal mature rabbit sequence and the M-13 reverse primer 5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA. Similarly, the M-T2 leader sequence containing mature rabbit TNF sequence was amplified using pMTN-6 (18Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1994; 204: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as template and the primers 5′-AGCTGATCTGAGCCCGTATACGCACGCGACCTA and the M-13 reverse primer. Twenty rounds of amplification were carried out using 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase in 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100 µg/ml gelatin, 0.25 µM dXTPs followed by gel purification of the products. The two products with overlapping termini were mixed, denatured by heating to 95°C, and allowed to reanneal. Taq DNA polymerase and dXTPs were added to allow 3′ extension from the overlapping termini, and a second round of polymerase chain reaction amplification of the full-length extension was carried out using M-13 reverse primers. The product was digested with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII site of pBluescript SK− to create pBlueT2RaTNF. This clone was sequenced to ensure no errors had been introduced during the polymerase chain reaction amplification. A SalI-BamHI fragment of pBlueT2RaTNF was subcloned into pMJ601 to generate pMJ601T2RaTNF. The recombinant vaccinia virus VV-T2RaTNF (strain WR) was constructed as described previously (39Opgenorth A. Graham K. Nation N. Strayer D. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4720-4731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myxoma T2 protein was purified from media from VV-MT2-infected BGMK cells in roller bottles (3 × 108 cells). Supernatants were prepared as described previously (18Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1994; 204: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the media from 8-16 roller bottles was concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration cell to a volume of 20-30 ml and dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 4°C. The dialyzed sample was applied to a Mono-Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and protein was eluted using a linear salt gradient, 0-500 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing M-T2 were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mM bis-Tris, pH 6.4, and reapplied to a Mono-Q anion exchange column. Protein was eluted using a 0-500 mM NaCl salt gradient at pH 6.4. M-T2-containing fractions were analyzed for purity by silver staining of polyacrylamide gels (41Garfin D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 425-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Rabbit TNFα was purified from supernatants from VV-T2RaTNF-infected BGMK cells in roller bottles in an identical fashion, using pH 7.5 Mono-Q anion exchange chromatography followed by pH 6.4 anion exchange chromatography. The M-T2 or rabbit TNFα protein present in the different fractions was confirmed by silver staining and quantitated by A280 measurements. Antiserum was prepared by intradermally injecting rabbits with purified T2 protein (native) in Freund's complete adjuvant or with purified T2 protein resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (denatured) with acrylamide as adjuvant using standard procedures (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring HarborNew York1988Google Scholar). Immunoblots confirmed that the polyclonal antiserum recognized T2 protein from supernatants from myxoma- and VV-MT2-infected cells and did not cross-react with any proteins present in supernatants from cells infected with the T2-minus myxoma virus, (vMyxt2g) or control VV-601. Western analysis was used to estimate the amount of M-T2 protein secreted from from vMyxlac and VV-MT2-infected cells, probing with a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit anti-M-T2 antiserum followed by a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bio-Rad). The intensities of the bands visualized were measured by scanning using a Joyce Loebl Chromoscan 3 densitometer. The results of four separate Western blots were averaged to determine the amount of M-T2 protein present in supernatants, using various titrations of purified M-T2 protein as the standard. To detect M-T2 and rabbit TNFα proteins secreted from recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells, confluent BGMK cell monolayers in six-well dishes were adsorbed with virus for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Next, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% newborn calf serum was added, and the infection was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 4 h. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated 16 h in 0.5 ml of serum-free, Met-free, Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 150 µCi of 35S Express protein label ([35S]Met/Cys mixture, DuPont NEN), after which supernatants were collected. 100-µl supernatants from VV-MT2, VV-T2RaTNF, or VV-601-infected cells were coincubated for 1 h at 4°C, after which 1 µg of purified goat anti-rabbit TNF-α antibody (PharMingen) or a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-T2 antiserum was added and the mixture was incubated for 1 h further at 4°C. Next, 30 µl of protein A beads (10% (v/v) in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) was added, and the antibody-antigen reaction was incubated 1 h further at 4°C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C, and the immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 µl of Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel was dried onto Whatman 3MM chromatography paper and analyzed by autoradiography. Alternatively, 25 ng of purified T2 protein was incubated wtih 100 µl of 35S-Met/Cys-labeled supernatant from VV-T2RaTNF-infected cells, and coimmunoprecipitations were performed as above using a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-M-T2 antiserum. A Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) was calibrated using thryoglobulin, ferritin, catalase, aldolase, and bovine serum albumin (Pharmacia) as size standards. Purified T2 protein was loaded onto the calibrated Sephadex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with PBS, and fractions were collected. Fractions containing protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiotreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol sample loading buffer) or nonreducing conditions (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol sample loading buffer), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit anti-M-T2 antisera as described (18Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1994; 204: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed on a Beckman Spinco model E analytical ultracentrifuge using absorbance optics. The run was performed at 8000 rpm in PBS at 20°C. The molecular weight (M) was calculated using the equation, M=2RT(1−v¯ρ)ω2d(ln(C))d(r2)(Eq.1) where R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the angular velocity, and d(lnC)/dr2 is the slope from the plot in Fig. 4. Based on the amino acid composition of M-T2 protein, , was calculated to be 0.69. As M-T2 is glycosylated, for the glycoprotein was calculated to be 0.66 using the formula (M11+ M22)/(M1+ M2), where M1, 1, and M2, 2 are the masses and partial specific volume of the protein and the sugar component, respectively. Purified rabbit TNFα, human TNFα (Quality Controlled Biochemicals), and mouse TNFα (PharMingen) were labeled with Na125I (DuPont NEN) to a specific activity of 105 Ci/mole using lactoperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide according to standard procedures (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring HarborNew York1988Google Scholar). Falcon 96-well immunoplates were coated with 100 ng of purified M-T2 protein in 50 µl of PBS, overnight at 4°C. Wells were blocked with 5% skim milk powder in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, followed by binding of 125I-labeled TNFα in 50 µl of blocking buffer for 2 h. Wells were washed three times with PBS, removed, and counted on a Beckman Gamma 5500 radiation counter. To determine the specific binding of M-T2 to TNFα, nonspecific binding in the presence of a 100-fold excess of cold TNFα was subtracted from total binding, and such nonspecific binding routinely represented less than 5% of total binding. All assays were performed in triplicate, and binding of 125I-labeled TNFα to myxoma T2 was analyzed by the method of Scatchard (43Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17712) Google Scholar). To measure specific binding of 125I-labeled rabbit TNFα to RL-5 (rabbit T cell lymphoma) cells, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in microcentrifuge tubes in 100 µl of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 500 pM125I-labeled rabbit TNFα in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of cold TNFα, for 1 h at 4°C. The cell suspension was then layered over 250 µl of transport oil (15% paraffin oil, 85% silicon 550 oil, specific gravity 1.032 g/ml) in microcentrifuge tubes; the cells were pelleted through the oil by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min; and the oil and cell pellet were washed three times with water. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5% SDS, and the radioactivity present in the cell pellet was measured on a Beckman 5500 γ counter. VV-601 and VV-MT2 supernatants were prepared as described above. To test the ability of M-T2 protein to inhibit binding, 2 × 106 cells were incubated with 500 pM125I-labeled rabbit TNFα and 200 nM purified M-T2 protein or 10% (v/v) VV-601 supernatant or VV-MT2 supernatant containing 50 nM M-T2 protein and processed as described above. All assays were performed in triplicate. To measure TNF-binding to RK-13 (rabbit fibroblast) cells, 1 × 106 RK-13 cells seeded in six-well dishes were incubated in 200 µl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. 125I-Labeled rabbit TNFα was added to a concentration of 500 pM, in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of cold TNF to measure specific binding, or in the presence of 20 nM purified M-T2 protein, and cells were incubated 1 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 200 µl of 0.5% SDS, and the radioactivity remaining in the sample was measured on a Beckman γ counter. All assays were performed in triplicate. The ability of purified myxoma T2 protein to protect rabbit or mouse cells from TNFα-induced cytolysis was measured as described previously (18Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1994; 204: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except that for RK-13 cells viability was measured by crystal violet staining as described (44Sugarman B.J. Aggarwal B. Hass P.E. Figari I.S. Palladino M.A. Shepard H.M. Science. 1985; 230: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). TNFα (rabbit, mouse, human) was used at concentrations for which the cell death end point value was greater than 95% for L929-8 cells and greater than 65% for RK-13 cells. Results are expressed as the percentage of viable cells compared with untreated control cells, the mean of quadruplicate samples calculated by the following formula: ((OD experimental − OD maximum killing)/(OD maximum viability − OD maximum killing) × 100), where OD represents optical density. When protection was expressed as an increase in percentage of viability (% viability), the formula (% viability experimental −% viability in the absence of M-T2) was used. In calculating M-T2:TNFα ratios, molarities were calculated for the M-T2 monomer and TNFα trimer unless stated otherwise. Recombinant vaccinia viruses were engineered to express myxoma T2 protein (VV-MT2) and rabbit TNFα (VV-RaTNF and VV-T2RaTNF) in order to obtain enough protein for binding studies (diagrammed in Fig. 1A). Previously, the complete sequence for the rabbit TNFα cDNA, including the 79-amino acid leader, was placed under the control of the synthetic late promoter in the recombinant virus VV-RaTNF (18Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1994; 204: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, TNFα was not efficiently expressed as a secreted ligand from cells infected with VV-RaTNF, so instead the recombinant vaccinia virus VV-T2RaTNF was constructed in which the presequence N-terminal to the mature rabbit TNFα was excised and replaced with the 16-amino acid leader sequence of myxoma T2 protein. Pro-myxoma T2 protein was found by N-terminal sequencing to be cleaved at its predicted signal cleavage site between Gly-16 and Gly-17. The biologically active rabbit TNFα secreted from VV-T2RaTNF-infected cells has a molecular mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gels identical to the 18-kDa reported molecular mass of rabbit TNFα (45Aggarwal B.B. Aggarwal B.B. Vilcek J. Tumor Necrosis Factors: Structure, Function and Mechanism of Action. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1992: 61Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Both myxoma T2 protein and rabbit TNFα were purified from supernatants from virally infected BGMK cells by two rounds of anion-exchange Mono-Q chromatography at pH 7.5 and 6.4. Fig. 1B displays proteins present in crude supernatants from cells infected with vector control vaccinia virus, VV601 (lane 1), and cells infected with VV-MT2 (lane 2). At pH 7.5, M-T2 protein eluted from the column at 150-280 mM NaCl (lane 3). When reapplied to the anion exchange column at pH 6.4, a single protein band was observed on silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels in fractions collected at 100-150 mM NaCl, with no protein bands seen from supernatants from vector control virus, VV601, processed in identical fashion (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). The purification of rabbit TNFα is illustrated in Fig. 1C, starting from supernatants of VV-T2RaTNF-infected monolayers (lane 1). At pH 7.5, rabbit TNFα eluted from the Mono-Q column at 300-340 mM NaCl (Fig. 1C, lane 2). TNF-containing fractions were pooled and reapplied to the Mono-Q column at pH 6.4, and rabbit TNFα eluted at 260-275 mM NaCl as a single 18-kDa species when visualized on silver-stained gels (Fig. 1C, lane 3). The amount of M-T2 protein secreted into supernatants from BGMK cells infected with either VV-MT2 or vMyxlac virus was quantitated from densitometric scans of Western blots, using various titrations of purified M-T2 protein as standards. As expected, the amount of M-T2 protein secreted from VV-MT2-infected cells was significantly higher than from myxoma-infected cells: (1.0 ± 0.4) × 108 molecules/24 h of M-T2 secreted per VV-MT2-infected cell compared with (2.8 ± 0.5) × 106 molecules/24 h of M-T2 secreted per vMyxlac infected cell. In VV-MT2, the M-T2 gene is under the control of a very strong synthetic late promoter (40Davison A.J. Moss B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4285-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which accounts for the enhanced expression compared with the standard (early) promoter in the parental myxoma virus. To determine whether M-T2 protein and rabbit TNFα physically associate, immunoprecipitation experiments were perfo"

Neither responds to epidermal growth factor (EGF). NGF primarily induces the RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and IL-6 activates a JAK (Janus tyrosine kinase)/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) response. EGF also stimulates RAS/ERK but in a transient manner. When either cell type is treated with combinations of NGF, EGF, and IL-6, at concentrations that produce modest or no response, a substantial augmentation of neurite outgrowth is observed. With PC12-E2 cells, a subthreshold concentration of IL-6 increases NGF response by ~2-3-fold after 1-2 days; the increase with EGF is more pronounced. Native PC12 cells show even greater synergistic effects with NGF and IL-6. The most dramatic effect was observed with low levels of EGF, where IL-6 increased the percentage of responsive cells from zero to ~60% after 3 days. In addition, two neural-specific transcripts, GAP-43 and SCG-10, are synergistically increased by the combinations of growth factors. Importantly, IL-6 does not enhance ERK phosphorylation in the presence of either NGF or EGF. In contrast, NGF and EGF, in the presence or absence of IL-6, cause mobility shifts of Stat3 that are consistent with serine phosphorylations. Although these modifications do not lead to activation and translocation by themselves, in the presence of the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by IL-6, they may play a role in the synergistic responses.

https://openalex.org/W2077893717,"We report the identification of a novel class of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinases whose members contain C-terminal C2 domains. We have isolated Drosophila and murine genes (termed cpk and cpk-m respectively) by polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA libraries with degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of PtdIns kinases. The amino acid sequences of Cpk and Cpk-m are most similar to that of p110, a family of PtdIns 3-kinases that mediates the responses of cells to mitogenic stimuli. The Cpk and Cpk-m sequences are similar to a large, central region of p110, but differ from p110 at their N and C termini. The N termini of the Cpk proteins do not contain any recognizable protein motif, while the C termini contain “C2 domains,” a feature unique among PtdIns kinases. Cpk has an intrinsic PtdIns kinase activity and can phosphorylate PtdIns and PtdIns-4-P, but not PtdIns(4,5)P2, at the D3 position of the inositol ring. Cpk is the first PtdIns 3-kinase identified with this particular substrate specificity. We have identified two potential Cpk-binding proteins, p90 and p190, and have determined that both Cpk and p190 may be tyrosine phosphorylated.

PtdIns kinases phosphorylate phosphoinositol lipids at distinct positions on the inositol ring; PtdIns 3-kinases phosphorylate the D3 hydroxyl group on the inositol ring, while PtdIns 4-kinases phosphorylate the D4 hydroxyl group (reviewed in Carpenter and Cantley (4Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). All PtdIns kinases contain a core region of sequence similarity, which is believed to be the catalytic domain. This domain, termed the “PtdIns kinase domain,” shares limited sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of protein kinases (Hiles et al., 13Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J.

Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the mechanism used by PtdIns kinases to modulate regulatory pathways remains unknown.A number of receptor tyrosine kinases, src-like tyrosine kinases and viral oncoproteins bind and activate a cellular PtdIns 3-kinase (reviewed in Carpenter and Cantley (4Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). Studies of mutants that abrogate the binding of this PtdIns 3-kinase to these molecules suggest that PtdIns 3-kinases can mediate mitogenic and cell motility responses of cells to growth factors and oncoproteins. Purification of the polypeptide subunits of this PtdIns 3-kinase revealed that the enzyme exists as a heterodimeric complex composed of a 110- and an 85-kDa subunit (Carpenter et al., 3Carpenter C.L.

The association of the enzyme with activated growth factor receptors may localize it to the plasma membrane, where its phospholipid substrates reside.Recently, a number of genes have been identified that are similar to a large, central portion of p110, but which differ from p110 at their N and C termini (Stoyanov et al., 43Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5645-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The product of one such gene, p110γ, can be activated in vitro by either the α or βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Stoyanov et al., 43Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that different classes of receptors may utilize distinct mechanisms to activate p110-related enzymes (Stoyanov et al., 43Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar).The substrate specificity of p110/p85 in vitro may differ from its substrate specificity in vivo. In vitro, p110/p85 can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) on the D3 hydroxyl group of the inositol ring, producing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns-3-P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (reviewed in Kapeller and Cantley (19Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and Stephens et al. (42Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar)). p110/p85 may phosphorylate a subset of its in vitro substrates in intact cells. Activation of p110/p85 in cells results in an increase in the cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but not PtdIns-3-P (Auger et al., 1Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar; Stephens et al., 41Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F.

Therefore, it is possible that in vivo p110/p85 phosphorylates only a subset of the substrates that it is capable of phosphorylating in vitro.The stimulation of cells with growth factors or tumor antigens results in a rapid increase in the cellular concentrations of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 from a low basal level, which suggests that these molecules may represent novel second messengers. Several protein kinases have recently been described which may represent downstream effectors of the lipid products of PtdIns 3-kinases. The Akt protein kinase can be activated in vivo by treating cells with the mitogen platelet-derived growth factor, and the binding of PtdIns 3-kinase to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor is essential for Akt activation (Franke et al., 7Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). Akt can be directly activated in vitro with PtdIns-3-P, although the effects of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on Akt activity are not known. In addition to Akt, particular isoforms of protein kinase C can be activated by the lipid products of PtdIns 3-kinases. Protein kinase C isoforms δ, ε, η, and ζ can be activated in vitro with PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but not with PtdIns-3-P (Nakanishi et al., 30Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Toker et al., 46Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Akt or isoforms of protein kinase C may directly mediate PtdIns 3-kinase signaling by responding to increases in the cellular concentration of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.A PtdIns 3-kinase has also been implicated in the regulation of intracellular protein sorting. Vps34 was initially identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant defective in the trafficking of proteins to the vacuole (Herman and Emr, 11Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Vps34 can phosphorylate PtdIns, but not PtdIns-4-P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro, which is consistent with absence of detectable PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in yeast (Schu et al., 37Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Vps34 is the major PtdIns 3-kinase in yeast; VPS34 mutant strains contain no detectable PtdIns-3-P (Schu et al., 37Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar).There is evidence for the existence of PtdIns 3-kinase activities distinct from p110/p85 and Vps34, and for this reason we have sought to identify novel PtdIns 3-kinases (reviewed in Stephens et al. (42Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar)). We have isolated and characterized a novel PtdIns 3-kinase from Drosophila melanogaster that can phosphorylate both PtdIns and PtdIns-4-P in vitro. We have designated this gene cpk (: 2 containing tdIns inase) because it contains a “C2 domain.” We have also identified a mouse gene (named cpk-m) that contains a C2 domain and shares extensive sequence identity with cpk. Therefore, the cpk and cpk-m represent a new class of PtdIns 3-kinases.DISCUSSIONWe report the identification of a novel class of PtdIns 3-kinases whose members contain C-terminal C2 domains. We have isolated Drosophila and murine genes (termed cpk and cpk-m, respectively) whose products share 34% sequence identity and 48% sequence similarity. The finding of a related genes in vertebrates and invertebrates suggests that Cpk may define a new class of conserved PtdIns 3-kinase and that Cpk regulatory pathways may also be conserved. In a recent independent study, MacDougall et al. (25MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1404-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) also report the identification of this gene.Cpk and Cpk-m are more closely related to the p110 family of PtdIns 3-kinases than to other families of PtdIns kinases. Amino acids 863-1587 of Cpk are approximately 31% identical and 43% similar to a large, central region of mammalian p110 (Hiles et al., 13Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 419-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Cpk and Cpk-m differ from p110 at their N and C termini and therefore probably do not represent p110 homologues. The N termini of the Cpk proteins do not contain any recognizable domain, and do not resemble a domain at the N terminus of p110 that mediates its interaction with the p85 subunit (Holt et al., 14Holt K.H. Olson A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Klippel et al., 22Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have determined that Cpk does not form a complex with p85 when both proteins are coexpressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown).The Drosophila and murine Cpk proteins contain a C2 domain at their C termini. C2 domains are found in a diverse group of proteins, including some isoforms of protein kinase C, synaptotagmin, and rabphilin (reviewed in Nishizuka (31Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar), Perin et al. (33Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), and Shirataki et al. (39Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar)). C2 domains were initially described as Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding motifs that can mediate the translocation of proteins to membranes (reviewed in Nishizuka (31Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar)). Indeed, MacDougall et al. (25MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1404-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) demonstrate that recombinant C2 domain derived from their PtdIns kinase clone (termed 68D) can weakly bind to phospholipids. In addition to binding phospholipids, C2 domains can also mediate interactions between proteins. A C2 domain from synaptotagmin, a synaptic vesicle protein, can bind AP-2 complexes (-: dapter rotein ) with a high affinity (Zhang et al., 55Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). AP-2 is a protein complex which is believed to play a role in the assembly of clathrin-coated pits and may target proteins to coated pits for recycling. Also, a C2 domain from protein kinase C can mediate its interaction with RACKs (: eceptors for ctivated inases, reviewed in Liscovitch and Cantley (24Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar)). RACKs have been implicated in the regulation of the kinase activity and intracellular localization of protein kinase C (reviewed in Mochly-Rosen (28Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar)). 2D. Mochly-Rosen, personal communication. Therefore, it is possible that the C2 domain in Cpk may function as a regulatory domain by binding lipids or proteins which modulate its intracellular localization or enzymatic activity.We have characterized the enzymatic activity of the Cpk. PtdIns kinases phosphorylate PtdIns at either the D3 or D4 hydroxyl group of the inositol ring. Cpk can phosphorylate PtdIns at the D3 position of the inositol ring, in a manner similar to p110 PtdIns 3-kinases. We have also determined the substrate specificity of the Cpk. p110 can phosphorylate PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro. In contrast to p110, Cpk can phosphorylate PtdIns and PtdIns-4-P, but not PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro. Cpk is the first PtdIns 3-kinase identified with this particular substrate specificity. The kinase assays were performed using Cpk derived from two sources, native protein purified from Drosophila lysates and recombinant protein purified from COS-7 cells. Also, we have determined that the PtdIns 3-kinase activity associated with Cpk is intrinsic by demonstrating that point mutations within the catalytic domain of Cpk result in an inactive enzyme. MacDougall et al. (25MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1404-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) also report a similar in vitro substrate specificity associated with recombinant 68D purified from insect cells. We do not know to what extent the substrate specificity determined using in vitro kinase assays reflects the substrate specificity in cells.The treatment of cells with mitogenic stimuli results in the rapid accumulation of the products of PtdIns 3-kinases from a low basal level. This observation suggests that these lipids may represent novel second messengers, although candidate effectors have only recently been described. Three protein kinases whose activity can be regulated by the lipid products of a PtdIns 3-kinase have been described. The Akt protein kinase is specifically activated by PtdIns-3-P (Franke et al., 7Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar), while particular isoforms of protein kinase C are activated by PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Nakanishi et al., 30Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Toker et al., 46Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that Cpk acts in a pathway in which its lipid products regulate a currently unidentified effector.Several PtdIns 3-kinases are known to be associated with regulatory proteins. For example, the p110 PtdIns 3-kinase associates with an 85-kDa subunit which is essential for the proper localization and activation of p110. p85 binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors, and this interaction may localize p110 to the plasma membrane, where its lipid substrates reside (Hu et al., 15Hu P.

Dhand R. Gout I. Otsu M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25958-25966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to functioning as an adapter, p85 is required for the enzymatic activity of p110; p110 must be associated with p85 to be fully active (Holt et al., 14Holt K.H. Olson A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Klippel et al., 22Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Vps34 PtdIns 3-kinase associates with the Vps15 protein kinase and this complex regulates intracellular protein sorting (Stack et al., 40Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Vps15 is required for both the membrane localization and the PtdIns kinase activity of Vps34 (Stack et al., 40Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Cpk associates with a protein that can modulate its intracellular localization or enzymatic activity. We have identified two potential Cpk interacting proteins, p90 and p190. Interestingly, both Cpk and p190 are tyrosine phosphorylated. The only other PtdIns kinase known to be tyrosine phosphorylated is p85/p110 and this phosphorylation occurs upon recruitment of the enzyme to activated growth factor receptors. It is possible that p190 represents a growth factor receptor, its substrate, or another protein that modulates the activity of Cpk.Surprisingly little is known about the physiological role of PtdIns 3-kinases in a multicellular organism. We can now utilize the sophisticated genetic tools available in Drosophila to study Cpk. Drosophila is also an excellent system for a biochemical analysis of Cpk, since lysates that contain active Cpk enzyme are likely to contain Cpk regulators and associated proteins. The observation that Cpk may be tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo is intriguing, and the identification of the tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates it might provide information concerning the physiological role of Cpk.

Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). PtdIns kinases phosphorylate phosphoinositol lipids at distinct positions on the inositol ring; PtdIns 3-kinases phosphorylate the D3 hydroxyl group on the inositol ring, while PtdIns 4-kinases phosphorylate the D4 hydroxyl group (reviewed in Carpenter and Cantley (4Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). All PtdIns kinases contain a core region of sequence similarity, which is believed to be the catalytic domain. This domain, termed the “PtdIns kinase domain,” shares limited sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of protein kinases (Hiles et al., 13Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J.

Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the mechanism used by PtdIns kinases to modulate regulatory pathways remains unknown.A number of receptor tyrosine kinases, src-like tyrosine kinases and viral oncoproteins bind and activate a cellular PtdIns 3-kinase (reviewed in Carpenter and Cantley (4Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). Studies of mutants that abrogate the binding of this PtdIns 3-kinase to these molecules suggest that PtdIns 3-kinases can mediate mitogenic and cell motility responses of cells to growth factors and oncoproteins. Purification of the polypeptide subunits of this PtdIns 3-kinase revealed that the enzyme exists as a heterodimeric complex composed of a 110- and an 85-kDa subunit (Carpenter et al., 3Carpenter C.L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 110-kDa subunit contains a C-terminal PtdIns kinase domain, as well as a small domain at its N terminus that is sufficient for binding to the 85-kDa subunit (Holt et al., 14Holt K.H. Olson A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Hiles et al., 13Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F.

The association of the enzyme with activated growth factor receptors may localize it to the plasma membrane, where its phospholipid substrates reside.Recently, a number of genes have been identified that are similar to a large, central portion of p110, but which differ from p110 at their N and C termini (Stoyanov et al., 43Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5645-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The product of one such gene, p110γ, can be activated in vitro by either the α or βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Stoyanov et al., 43Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that different classes of receptors may utilize distinct mechanisms to activate p110-related enzymes (Stoyanov et al., 43Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar).The substrate specificity of p110/p85 in vitro may differ from its substrate specificity in vivo. In vitro, p110/p85 can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) on the D3 hydroxyl group of the inositol ring, producing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns-3-P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (reviewed in Kapeller and Cantley (19Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and Stephens et al. (42Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar)). p110/p85 may phosphorylate a subset of its in vitro substrates in intact cells. Activation of p110/p85 in cells results in an increase in the cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but not PtdIns-3-P (Auger et al., 1Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar; Stephens et al., 41Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F.

Therefore, it is possible that in vivo p110/p85 phosphorylates only a subset of the substrates that it is capable of phosphorylating in vitro.The stimulation of cells with growth factors or tumor antigens results in a rapid increase in the cellular concentrations of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 from a low basal level, which suggests that these molecules may represent novel second messengers. Several protein kinases have recently been described which may represent downstream effectors of the lipid products of PtdIns 3-kinases. The Akt protein kinase can be activated in vivo by treating cells with the mitogen platelet-derived growth factor, and the binding of PtdIns 3-kinase to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor is essential for Akt activation (Franke et al., 7Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). Akt can be directly activated in vitro with PtdIns-3-P, although the effects of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on Akt activity are not known. In addition to Akt, particular isoforms of protein kinase C can be activated by the lipid products of PtdIns 3-kinases. Protein kinase C isoforms δ, ε, η, and ζ can be activated in vitro with PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but not with PtdIns-3-P (Nakanishi et al., 30Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Toker et al., 46Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Akt or isoforms of protein kinase C may directly mediate PtdIns 3-kinase signaling by responding to increases in the cellular concentration of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.A PtdIns 3-kinase has also been implicated in the regulation of intracellular protein sorting. Vps34 was initially identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant defective in the trafficking of proteins to the vacuole (Herman and Emr, 11Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Vps34 can phosphorylate PtdIns, but not PtdIns-4-P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro, which is consistent with absence of detectable PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in yeast (Schu et al., 37Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Vps34 is the major PtdIns 3-kinase in yeast; VPS34 mutant strains contain no detectable PtdIns-3-P (Schu et al., 37Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar).There is evidence for the existence of PtdIns 3-kinase activities distinct from p110/p85 and Vps34, and for this reason we have sought to identify novel PtdIns 3-kinases (reviewed in Stephens et al. (42Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar)). We have isolated and characterized a novel PtdIns 3-kinase from Drosophila melanogaster that can phosphorylate both PtdIns and PtdIns-4-P in vitro. We have designated this gene cpk (: 2 containing tdIns inase) because it contains a “C2 domain.” We have also identified a mouse gene (named cpk-m) that contains a C2 domain and shares extensive sequence identity with cpk. Therefore, the cpk and cpk-m represent a new class of PtdIns 3-kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1965705262,"Using a macrophage cell line that constitutively expresses a human apolipoprotein E (apoE) cDNA, we have investigated the post-translational metabolism of endogenously produced apoE. Inhibition of lysosomal or cysteine proteases led to significant inhibition of apoE degradation but did not increase apoE secretion, indicating that cellular degradation is not limiting for apoE secretion in macrophages. Treatment of macrophages with inhibitors of proteoglycan synthesis (4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside) or sulfation (sodium chlorate) enhanced the release of apoE from cells and significantly attenuated the increase in secretion produced by incubation with phosphatidylcholine vesicles (PV). These observations suggested that a significant fraction of the apoE retained by cells (and released by incubation with PV) was associated with proteoglycans. Treatment of cells with exogenous heparinase led to a greater than 4-fold increase in apoE secretion and similarly attenuated the response to PV, suggesting that apoE was trapped in an extracellular proteoglycan matrix. This conclusion was confirmed in studies showing that PV could enhance the release of apoE from cells during an incubation at 4 degrees C, but this enhanced release was abolished in proteoglycan-depleted cells. Incubation with lactoferrin at 4 or 37 degrees C produced a similar decrement in cellular apoE, again indicating the existence of a cell surface pool of apoE. Pulse-chase studies showed that the apoE trapped in the proteoglycan matrix was susceptible to rapid cellular degradation such that net synthesis of apoE (secreted plus cell-associated) was increased significantly in proteoglycan-depleted cells compared with control cells as early as 45 min during a chase period."
https://openalex.org/W2008864694,"We have identified a series of proteins based on an affinity for cisplatin-damaged DNA. One protein termed DRP-1 has been purified to homogeneity and was isolated as two distinct complexes. The first complex is a heterodimer of 83- and 68-kDa subunits, while the second complex is a heterotrimer of 350-, 83-, and 68-kDa subunits in a 1:1:1 ratio. The 83- and 68-kDa subunits in each complex are identical. The 83-kDa subunit of DRP-1 was identified as the p80 subunit of Ku autoantigen by N-terminal protein sequence analysis and reactivity with a monoclonal antibody directed against human Ku p80 subunit. The 68-kDa subunit of DRP-1 cross-reacted with monoclonal antisera raised against the Ku autoantigen p70 subunit. The 350-kDa subunit was identified as DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of the human DNA-activated protein kinase, DNA-PK. DRP-1/Ku DNA binding was assessed in mobility shift assays and competition binding assays using cisplatin-damaged DNA. Results indicate that DNA binding was essentially unaffected by cisplatin-DNA adducts in the presence or absence of DNA-PKcs. DNA-PK activity was only stimulated with undamaged DNA, despite the ability of Ku to bind to cisplatin-damaged DNA. The lack of DNA-PK stimulation by cisplatin-damaged DNA correlated with the extent of cisplatin-DNA adduct formation. These results demonstrate that Ku can bind cisplatin-damaged DNA but fails to activate DNA-PK. These results are discussed with respect to the repair of cisplatin-DNA adducts and the role of DNA-PK in coordinating DNA repair processes.

The intracellular target of cisplatin is DNA, and cisplatin-DNA adducts are thought to impart its chemotherapeutic efficacy. Resistance to cisplatin is a common clinical problem and is likely a multifactorial process (1Perez R.P. Hamilton T.C. Ozols R.F. Young R.C. Cancer. 1993; 71: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition to increased efflux, decreased influx, and drug sequestration, cellular repair of cisplatin-DNA adducts has been suggested as one mechanism of cisplatin resistance (1Perez R.P. Hamilton T.C. Ozols R.F. Young R.C. Cancer. 1993; 71: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A series of cell lines resistant to cisplatin were generated from ovarian carcinoma cells by in vitro exposure to increasing concentrations of cisplatin (2Masuda H. Ozols R.F. Lai G.M. Fojo A. Rothenberg M. Hamilton T.C. Cancer. Res. 1988; 48: 5713-5716PubMed Google Scholar). The resistant cells were found to have an increased ability to repair both intrastrand and interstrand cisplatin-DNA adducts, supporting the hypothesis that DNA repair contributes to cisplatin resistance (3Johnson S.W. Perez R.P. Godwin A.K. Yeung A.T. Handel L.M. Ozols R.F. Hamilton T.C. Biochem.

The cellular activities responsible for metabolizing cisplatin-DNA adducts remain largely undefined. In vitro excision repair assays have established that the human excision repair pathway is capable of repairing 1,2-d(GpG)cisplatin intrastrand DNA adducts, albeit at a considerably lower efficiency compared with the repair of thymine dimers (4Sibghat-Ullah I. Husain I. Carlton W. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4471-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Jones S.L. Hickson I.D. Harris A.L. Harnett P.R. Int. J.

In addition to intrastrand adducts that are repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway, interstrand DNA cross-links are formed in the reaction with cisplatin and are likely to be repaired by a double-stranded DNA break mechanism. In elucidating the specific pathways that mediate repair of cisplatin-DNA adducts, the identification of cellular proteins that have an affinity for cisplatin-damaged DNA has been an active area of research (reviewed in Ref. 7Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High mobility group 1 protein (HMG-1) has been identified as a cisplatin-DNA binding protein (8Hughes E.N.

Science. 1993; 261: 603-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Bruhn S.L. Pil P.M. Essigmann J.M. Housman D.E. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2307-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The specific role HMG-1 plays in cellular DNA metabolism is still unclear despite first being identified as a non-histone chromosomal protein more than 20 years ago. The human single-stranded DNA binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), has also been identified in cisplatin-DNA-protein complexes by Western blot analysis (13Clugston C.K. McLaughlin K. Kenny M.K. Brown R. Cancer. Res. 1992; 52: 6375-6379PubMed Google Scholar). RPA has also been demonstrated to be required for excision repair of thymine dimers (14Coverley D. Kenny M.K. Munn M. Rupp W.D. Lane D.P. Wood R.D. Nature. 1991; 349: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and presumably cisplatin-damaged DNA and may play a role in mediating repair processes. In this report, we have identified the human Ku autoantigen as a cisplatin-DNA binding protein. Ku has been previously purified and characterized as a DNA binding protein with an affinity for the ends of double-stranded DNA (15Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol.

More recently Ku was shown to bind to DNA substrates containing small gaps and nicks (18Morozov V.E. Falzon M. Anderson C.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16684-16688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ku can also form a complex with the 350-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) of the human DNA-activated protein kinase (DNA-PK) (19Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). DNA-PK is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that requires DNA for activity (reviewed in Refs. 20Anderson C.W. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar and 21Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 2: 283-314Google Scholar). Ku is the DNA binding component, and the Ku-DNA complex stimulates DNA-PKcs protein kinase activity (19Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Independently, Ku and DNA-PK protein have been implicated in double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination. The radiosensitive cell line xrs-6 deficient for both V(D)J recombination and double-strand break repair is devoid of Ku DNA end binding activity (22Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A.

Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Introduction of the gene encoding p86 into xrs-6 cells restored both end binding activity and DNA-PK activity, and the addition of purified Ku to extracts from xrs-6 cells restored in vitro DNA-PK activity (22Finnie N.J.

Another radiation-sensitive cell line belonging to the same complementation group was shown to be deficient in DNA end binding activity and was initially attributed to the loss of the Ku p70 subunit (24Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these cells were not rescued by expression of the p70 gene, but were partially rescued by expression of the p86 Ku cDNA (25Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Lieber M.R. Chu G. Science. 1994; 266: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Expression of the the gene encoding p86 also restored end binding activity and V(D)J recombination (25Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Lieber M.R. Chu G. Science. 1994; 266: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). DNA-PK can phosphorylate a number of proteins including Sp1, p53, SV-40 large T antigen, the C-terminal domain of RNA pol II, and the 32-kDa subunit of RPA (for a review see Ref. 20Anderson C.W. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recent cloning of the DNA-PK reveals homology to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, specifically those members involved in cell cycle regulation (26Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C. Zhang H.

We have assessed the affinity of Ku for cisplatin-damaged DNA and the ability of Ku to activate DNA-PKcs compared with undamaged DNA. Results suggest that Ku can bind cisplatin-damaged DNA, but does not activate DNA-PK. Unlabeled nucleotides were from Pharmacia Biotech, and radiolabeled nucleotides were from DuPont NEN. M13mp18 phage was prepared according to Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and RF-DNA was purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Molecular Biosystems 390 DNA synthesizer and purified by 15% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea preparative DNA sequencing gel electrophoresis (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Poly(dA-dT) was from Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX), and Sequenase Version 2.0 was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Restriction enzymes, immunology reagents, and cell culture supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were purchased from standard suppliers. The DNA oligonucleotides used in this study have been described previously (10Turchi J.J. Li M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A 75-mer DNA with the sequence 5′-TACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTTTGTTCCCTTTAGTGAGGGTTAATTCCGAGCT-3′ was employed to construct a 32P-labeled fully duplex DNA substrate. The 75-base pair fully duplex DNA substrate was prepared by annealing 10 pmol of the 75-mer with 20 pmol of a 24-mer DNA oligonucleotide (5′-AGCTCGGAATTAACCCTCACTAAA-3′), heating to 95°C for 5 min, and cooling to room temperature over the next hour in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT, and 10 mM magnesium acetate. The DNA was extended and labeled with 100 µM dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 100 µCi) using Sequenase. Extension reactions were performed for 30 min and then chased with 100 µM unlabeled dGTP to ensure the 24-mer was fully extended. For the preparation of substrates for DNA-PK assays, [α-32P]dGTP was replaced with 100 µM unlabeled dGTP. The 32P-labeled 75-mer DNA substrate was incubated with varying concentrations of cisplatin (Sigma) as described previously (10Turchi J.J. Li M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The DNA was purified from unreacted cisplatin by G-50 spin column chromatography (28Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cpm recovered was determined by liquid scintillation counting an aliquot of the eluate, and based on the specific activity obtained in the original labeling reactions, the fmol of DNA recovered was calculated. EMSAs were performed as described previously (10Turchi J.J. Li M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions contained 50 fmol of [32P]DNA and were allowed to reach equilibrium by incubation on ice for 30 min. Reaction products were separated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and the products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). One unit of DNA binding activity equals 50 fmol bound in 20 µl. DNA-PK assays were performed in a final volume of 20 µl containing 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol, [γ32P]ATP (0.2-0.5 µCi, 125 µM), and 12 µg of dephosphorylated casein (Sigma). Proteins and DNA were added as indicated in the figure legends and reactions incubated at 30°C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 30% acetic acid and spotted on Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Filters were washed 5 times for 5 min each in 15% acetic acid, once briefly in 100% methanol, dried, and radioactivity quantified in each spot by PhosphorImager analysis. Double-stranded salmon sperm DNA (USB, Cleveland, OH) was digested with EcoRI and BamHI for 18 h, CHCl3/phenol-extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The digested DNA was treated with cisplatin (Sigma) at a D/N ratio of 0.05:1, for 18 h at 37°C in the dark. This ratio of cisplatin/DNA results in approximately 1 adduct every 20 bases (29Ushay H.M. Tullius T.D. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3744-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The DNA was made 1 M in NaCl, precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol, and collected by sedimentation at 12,000 × g. The DNA pellet was resuspended in TE (Tris-EDTA) and precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol. The resulting pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in carbonate buffer, pH 9, at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. DNA was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final gel preparation contained 500 µg of DNA/ml of resin. Cell-free extracts were prepared from 4 liters of HeLa cells (2.5 × 109 cells) as described previously (10Turchi J.J. Li M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and fractionated on a 60-ml cisplatin-DNA Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol) containing 0.1 M NaCl and washed extensively. All buffers used in protein purification were supplemented with 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 µg/ml leupeptin. DRP-I cisplatin-DNA binding activity was eluted in buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl. The eluate was diluted to a conductivity equal to 100 mM NaCl and applied to a 15-ml Whatman P-11 phosphocellulose column. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 M NaCl in buffer A. Two separate peaks of binding activity termed DRP-1A and DRP-1B were obtained and pooled separately. Each pool was diluted to a conductivity equivalent to 100 mM NaCl and fractionated on a 5-ml Q-Sepharose column. Bound protein was eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 M NaCl in buffer A, and fractions containing at least 50% of the maximum activity were pooled. The DNA binding activity of DRP-1A eluted from the Q-Sepharose column with 250 mM NaCl and DRP-1B eluted with 225 mM NaCl. DRP-1A was highly purified following Q-Sepharose chromatography and further fractionation resulted in a reduction in specific activity (data not shown). The Q-Sepharose pool of DRP-1B still contained multiple proteins and, therefore, was fractionated further. The DRP-1B was diluted as described earlier and applied to a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.1 M NaCl. Bound protein was again eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 M NaCl in buffer A. Two-ml fractions were collected, assayed for cisplatin-DNA binding activity, and peak fractions pooled. The final step in the purification of DRP-1B was chromatography on a 1-ml S-Sepharose column. The heparin-Sepharose pool was diluted in buffer B (50 mM KPi, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA) to a conductivity equal to 0.1 M KCl and applied to a 1-ml S-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer B containing 0.1 M KCl. A 10-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 M KCl was employed to elute activity. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, assayed for binding activity, pooled as described above, and frozen at −70°C. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Lammeli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and gels were stained with silver according to Morrissey (31Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar) or transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) membranes. Electrophoretic transfer was performed in 50 mM CAPS, pH 11, 10% methanol at 350 mA for 3.5 h at 4°C. Membranes were blocked for 2 h in blocking buffer (2% non-fat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline). Monoclonal Ab (mAb) 111, directed against the Ku p80 subunit, and mAb N3H10, directed against the Ku p70 subunit, were provided by Dr. Westely Reeves (University of North Carolina) and were diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer (17Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Wang J. Chou C.H. Blankson J. Satoh M. Knuth M.W. Eisenberg R.A. Pisetsky D.S. Reeves W.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed 3 times for 15 min with phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-mouse-IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate secondary-antibody for 1 h. Membranes were washed as described above and visualized using chemiluminescent detection (DuPont NEN). For automated N-terminal sequence analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon Psq as described above. Following transfer, the membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 50% methanol, destained in 50% methanol, and the protein bands of interest excised. The membrane pieces were rinsed briefly in 100% methanol, dried, and subjected to automated Edman degradation. We have purified a protein capable of binding duplex DNA substrates damaged with cisplatin. We previously identified two activities capable of binding to cisplatin-damaged DNA duplex substrates following fractionation of HeLa whole cell extracts on a cisplatin-DNA-Sepharose column matrix. The protein responsible for one of the protein-DNA complexes was identified as HMG-1 (10Turchi J.J. Li M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We then set out to purify the proteins involved in formation of the other complex, termed DRP-1. The purification of DRP-1 is detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Following initial fractionation on a cisplatin-DNA-Sepharose column, the eluate was fractionated on a phosphocellulose column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DRP-1 activity was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 M NaCl, and each fraction was assayed for cisplatin-DNA binding in an EMSA. An autoradiogram of the EMSA is shown in Fig. 1 and demonstrates two peaks of DRP-1 DNA binding activity. The DRP-1 DNA-protein complexes observed upon native gel electrophoresis in fractions 7 and 9 are nearly identical. Fraction 7, termed DRP-1A, eluted at a NaCl concentration of 200 mM whereas fraction 9, termed DRP-1B, eluted at 300 mM NaCl. The slower migrating DRP-1 DNA-protein complex is likely a supershift representing two protein molecules bound to a single DNA substrate. In addition, a third complex running as a diffuse band near the top of the gel is observed in fractions 8 and 9. The faster migrating complex eluting mainly in fractions 11 and 12 is the HMG-1-cisplatin-DNA complex (10Turchi J.J. Li M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). DRP-1A and DRP-1B were collected and processed separately throughout the remaining steps in the purification as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results of the purification of DRP-1 are summarized in Table I.Table I.DRP-1 purificationFractionStepActivityVolumeProteinTotalSpecificPurificationYieldmlmgunitsa1 unit of binding activity equals the amount of protein required to bind 50 fmol of double-stranded 75-mer DNA in a 20-µl reaction.units/mg-fold%IExtract6765562319.511100IICisplatin-DNA-Sepharose2811.827722352544.5IIIAP-cell A7.70.4649010651127.9IIIBP-cell B7.51.171198102310719.1IVAQ-Sepharose A40.06143070497416.9IVBQ-Sepharose B60.36159616501749.6VBHeparin-Sepharose B80.13132424732605.2VIBS-Sepharose B1.50.0318627742911.4a 1 unit of binding activity equals the amount of protein required to bind 50 fmol of double-stranded 75-mer DNA in a 20-µl reaction. Open table in a new tab The pooled fractions from each column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Protein subunits of 83- and 68-kDa were selectively concentrated in the DRP-1A column pools (lanes 1-4). The final fraction of DRP-1A contained only the 83- and 68-kDa protein suggesting a heterodimeric structure. SDS-PAGE analysis of the DRP-1A column fractions obtained from Q-Sepharose chromatography demonstrated that the 83- and 68-kDa proteins co-migrated with cisplatin-DNA binding activity (data not shown). Interestingly, highly purified DRP-1B contained three predominant proteins. In addition to the 83- and 68-kDa subunits observed in DRP-1A, a protein migrating greater than the 220-kDa standard is also observed in DRP-1B fractions (Fig. 2, lanes 5-8). These three proteins co-migrated with cisplatin-DNA binding activity in DRP-1B fractionation on the Q, heparin, and S-Sepharose columns (data not shown). Quantification of the intensity of each band suggests that the high molecular mass, 83- and 68-kDa, proteins are present in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry (data not shown). The 83- and 68-kDa subunits present in both DRP-1A and -B likely account for their similar migration pattern observed upon EMSA analysis (Fig. 1). The diffuse high molecular weight complex observed in phosphocellulose fractions 8 and 9 and in the Q-Sepharose B pool (data not shown) may be a trimeric complex consisting of the high molecular weight protein, in addition to the p68 and p83 subunits. In addition, DRP-1B has a specific activity approximately 30% of that obtained for DRP-1A (Table I). Results from the SDS gel indicate that this lower specific activity is likely the result of the large subunit of DRP-1B contributing to the protein level without affecting DNA binding. The net result being a decreased specific activity compared with DRP-1A pools. N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified proteins was performed to identify the components of DRP-1. DRP-1 fractions were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and processed for automated N-terminal sequence analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 68-kDa subunit was blocked at the N terminus and yielded no sequence information. Reliable N-terminal sequence data were obtained from the p83 subunit. The first four cycles yielded ambiguous data; however, the following 12 cycles revealed unambiguous sequence information (Table II). A BLAST sequence homology search revealed identity in 11 out of 12 amino acids to the p80 subunit of human Ku autoantigen. Ku is a heterodimer of 80- and 70-kDa subunits that has DNA binding activity (15Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It also has been reported that the 70-kDa subunit is acetylated at the N terminus which would account for the inability to obtain N-terminal sequence data. These results strongly suggest that the activity binding to cisplatin-damaged DNA is Ku autoantigen. To confirm that in fact DRP-1 consists of Ku subunits, monoclonal antibodies generated against purified human Ku p80 and p70 (17Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Wang J. Chou C.H. Blankson J. Satoh M. Knuth M.W. Eisenberg R.A. Pisetsky D.S. Reeves W.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were used to probe Western blots of the fractions obtained during the purification. The DRP-1B pools from each step during the purification were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The filter was first probed with mAb N3H10 (anti-Ku p70) and visualized following secondary antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data obtained demonstrated that the p68 protein cross-reacted with mAb N3H10 (data not shown). The membrane was briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline, probed with mAb 111 (anti-Ku p80), and then processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequential probing of the filter without denaturing washes allowed detection of proteins in the DRP-1B pools that cross-reacted with both N3H10 and 111 mAbs. An autoradiogram of the Western blot is shown in Fig. 3 and demonstrates that mAb 111 and N3H10 recognize the 83- and 68-kDa subunits from DRP-1B, respectively. The crude extract gave a positive reaction with only the p68 subunit (lane 1). Increased exposure or decreased dilution of mAb 111 did reveal cross-reactivity of the DRP-1 p86 subunit in crude extracts with the 111 mAb (data not shown). The p68 and 83 subunits of DRP-1A also cross-reacted with mAb 111 and N3H10 mAbs (data not shown). These results provide definitive evidence that the p83 and p68 subunits of DRP-1 are homologous to human Ku p80 and p70 subunits.Table IIN-terminal sequence of DRP-1 p83 subunitProteinN-terminal sequenceDRP-1 p83-GNKAAVVLMDVKu p80MVRS-GNKAAVVLCMDV Open table in a new tab The remaining high molecular weight protein that associates with the Ku 80/70 proteins in the DRP-1B fraction was likely to be the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK.

To determine how asymmetry of leaflet composition affects membrane permeability, effects on bilayer permeation of reducing single leaflet permeability were determined using two approaches: formation of asymmetric bilayers in an Ussing chamber, with only one of two leaflets containing cholesterol sulfate, and stabilization of the external leaflet of unilamellar vesicles with praeseodymium (Pr3+). In both systems, permeability measurements showed that each leaflet acts as an independent resistor of water permeation.

https://openalex.org/W2034227439,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is regulated by at least two mechanisms involving protein kinase C (PKC), inhibition of EGF binding and inhibition of EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. In this study we investigated whether mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) mediates the inhibitory effects of PKC on EGFR binding or kinase activity by pretreating NIH3T3 and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the EGFR with PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK). We also determined whether substitution of cysteine for threonine at residue 669, the site of MAPK phosphorylation of the EGFR, alters the inhibition of kinase activity by PKC. The results indicate that 1) PKC down-regulates EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by an MEK-dependent mechanism presumably involving MAPK; 2) the inhibition by PKC is not a direct result of phosphorylation of the EGFR by PKC or MAPK; 3) activation of MAPK is not sufficient to regulate EGFR kinase activity; and 4) PKC-mediated down-regulation of EGF binding and EGFR kinase activity occur by different mechanisms. These data are consistent with a model for regulation of the EGFR by other receptors whereby their activation of PKC, in conjunction with MAPK, results in the phosphorylation of a protein(s) that modulates EGFR kinase activity."

CaCl2 had no effect on troponin binding to the thin filament in the presence of myosin S-1. The binding curve was weakly cooperative, implying interactions between adjacent troponin molecules.

The chains are synthesized with an amino-terminal signal peptide which is proteolytically removed from the preα1(X) chains during synthesis (7Thomas J.T. Cresswell C.J. Rash B. Nicolai H. Jones T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This appears to be the only post-translational proteolytic processing event, since both the NC2 and NC1 domains, which are thought to be important for intermolecular interactions and the formation of extracellular supramolecular assemblies, are retained on extracellular type X collagen (10Kwan A.P.L. Cummings C.E. Chapman J.A. Grant M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of the carboxyl-terminal NC1 domain of type X collagen with the C-propeptides of fibrillar collagens demonstrated a conserved cluster of aromatic residues within a 130-amino acid domain with a marked hydrophobicity profile similarity (11Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The role of the carboxyl-terminal propeptide domain of interstitial collagens in initiating intracellular α-chain selection, assembly, and helix formation is well established, and thus by analogy the α1(X) NC1 domain is likely to play a similar crucial role in type X assembly. Further evidence for the importance of the NC1 domain comes from studies on patients with Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD, 1The abbreviations used are: SMCDSchmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasiaPCRpolymerase chain reactionDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumbpbase pair(s)wtwild type.

For one of these NC1 mutations (G618V), in vitro expression was used to demonstrate that the mutation prevented in vitro type X collagen assembly (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), providing direct evidence for the role of the NC1 domain in assembly. To further study the biochemical role of the NC1 domain, and to address the question whether the common molecular defect in SMCD is compromised type X collagen molecular assembly due to NC1 mutations, we have produced three NC1 mutations, duplicating the spectrum of mutations defined in patients, 1952delC (NC1ΔC), 1963del10 (NC1Δ10), and Y598D, and expressed these in vitro and by transient transfection of cells. The biochemical consequences of mutations in the type X collagen helix and in the NC2 are also not known since naturally occurring mutations in these protein domains have not yet been defined. Transgenic mice have been generated expressing a chick type X collagen with a helical deletion (18Jacenko O. LuValle P.A. Olsen B.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These express a more severe spondylometaphyseal dysplasia phenotype which was attributed to the dominant negative effect of the mutant chick α1(X) associating with endogenous mouse α1(X) chains although the association of mutant:normal heterotrimers necessary for this dominant effect was not directly demonstrated. In this study an in-frame helix deletion (helixΔ), removing 283 helical amino acid residues, and a deletion mutation, removing the entire NC2 domain (NC2Δ), were constructed and expressed in vitro and in vivo. These site-directed mutagenesis studies were designed to determine the contribution of the NC1, NC2, and helical domains on type X collagen homotrimer and on mutant:normal heterotrimer molecular assembly and secretion. The production of a full-length α1(X) cDNA construct, pTM1-h10, in a T7-driven expression vector suitable both for in vitro transcription-translation and transient expression in cells using the vaccinia/T7 phage system (19Rich D.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region and a polyadenylation site was amplified using a reverse transcription-PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) from oligo(dT)-primed cDNA produced from hypertrophic chondrocyte mRNA (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A 1546-bp fragment was amplified using primers (BX1) 5′-CAGGGGGTAACAGGAATGCC-3′ (1726-1745) 2The base pairs in the COL10A1 coding sequence are numbered from the transcription start site (31Reichenberger E.

An additional sequence containing a SalI restriction enzyme site (sequence underlined) was added to primer HX14 for subsequent cloning purposes. The amplified fragment was digested with SalI, purified by agarose electrophoresis, recovered by electroelution, and cloned into the SmaI and SalI site of pUC19. A 1046-bp region of the 3′-untranslated region (2211-3256)2 was released from a positive clone by digestion with unique restriction enzymes NsiI and SalI and cloned into pTM1-h10 (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to produce a full-length human type X cDNA (pTM1-h10wt) containing the 3′-untranslated region including the first polyadenylation site. An in-frame helix deletion, 310del849 (helixΔ) was constructed within the COL1 domain in plasmid pTM1-h10wt. Unique restriction sites XhoI and NcoI were utilized to remove a 853-bp fragment. The digested plasmid was purified by agarose electrophoresis, recovered by electroelution, the resultant overhang sequences were filled in with Klenow, and blunt ends were ligated to produce the plasmid pTM1-helixΔ. This procedure removed the amino acid residues 72-354, 3Amino acids are numbered from the translation start site of pre-α1(X) (7Thomas J.T. Cresswell C.J. Rash B. Nicolai H. Jones T. Solomon E.

Within the normal helical domain, there are eight interruptions of the Gly-X-Y repeats, and this helical deletion removed seven, but introduced one new Gly-X-Y interruption resulting from the blunt ligation of codons for Arg71 to His355. Three human type X collagen NC1 Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia mutations (Fig. 1) were produced using splicing by overlap extension PCR (20Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). The mutant primer sets and their relative positions are shown in Table I. Primer set NC1ΔC-A and NC1ΔC-B introduce a single base deletion of cytosine 1952, 1952delC (12McIntosh I. Abbott M.H. Warman M.L. Olsen B.R. Francomano C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); primer set NC1Δ10-A and NC1Δ10-B introduce a 10-base pair deletion, 1963del10 (17Dharmavaram R.M. Elberson M.A. Peng M. Kirson L.A. Kelley T.E. Jimenez S.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 507-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); while primer set Y598D-A and Y598D-B introduce a single base substitution of T1988 for G and changed the amino acid tyrosine 598 to aspartate, Y598D (14Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sweetman W.A. Thomas J.T. Super M. Evans G. Grant M.E. Boot Handford R.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 169-178PubMed Google Scholar). The PCRs were carried out in 20 µl of 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 3 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 0.75 µM of each of the primers. The polymerase chain reactions were carried out in capillaries using the FTS-1 thermal sequencer from Corbett Research (Melbourne, Australia) over 26 cycles. Cycle one was performed at 96°C for 2 min, 62°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, then followed by 25 cycles at 96°C for 10 s, 62°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 20 s. The reaction was terminated at 72°C for 1 min. Two independent PCR products were first produced using BX1 (sense) with primer B (antisense) and primer A (sense) with HX6 (antisense) of each of the mutant primer sets in the primary round of PCR using pTM1-h10wt (5 ng) as a template. The amplified fragments were purified by agarose electrophoresis and recovered using Geneclean (BIO 101 Inc., Vista, CA) and subjected to a second round of overlapping PCR with primers BX1 and HX6. The recombinant mutant PCR fragments were purified, cloned, and sequenced to ensure that the correct mutations were introduced and that there were no PCR errors. A PflMI and NsiI fragment containing the mutations were first cloned into a genomic type X clone pMC2N (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and then introduced into pTM1-h10wt via NcoI and NsiI sites. Splicing by overlap extension PCR was also used to produce a NC2 157del102 mutation (NC2Δ). This deletion removes most of the NC2 domain except the first two amino acids (residues 19 and 20) and the last two amino acids (residues 55 and 56) of the NC2 domain (Fig. 1). The signal peptide (residues 1-18) remains unaltered. The plasmid pTM1-h10wt (5 ng) was used as a template for the primary rounds of PCR with primer pairs pTM1-1 (sense)/NC2ΔB (antisense) and NC2ΔA (sense)/HX10 (antisense) (Table I) to generate the two independent fragments with overlapping sequences. The second round PCR reaction was carried out with primers pTM1-1 and HX10 and 5 ng of each of the purified fragments from the primary PCR reactions. The recombinant fragment was purified and cloned into Bluescript SK II(+) and sequenced to confirm the deletion. A 362-bp fragment containing the NC2 deletion was released from the Bluescript SK II(+) cloned by digestion with KpnI and XhoI and ligated to a 957-bp XhoI-KpnI fragment (305-1262)2 from pTM1-h10wt. After digestion with KpnI, the expected 1319-bp fragment was purified and reintroduced into pTM1-h10wt via KpnI sites. Plasmids for cell-free translation were purified using ethidium bromide/CsCl2 centrifugation. The ethidium bromide was removed by several extractions with isopropanol equilibrated with NaCl-saturated 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mM EDTA and dialyzed against milli-Q water. The plasmids were translated using the TNT T7 polymerase coupled transcription and translation system (Promega) as described previously in a reaction volume of 12.5 µl (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Routinely, 0.25 µg of plasmid was used per reaction, and 2.5 µl of the final reaction are required for gel electrophoresis. In some experiments, canine microsomal membranes (Promega) were also added to promote collagen assembly (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Middleton R.B. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For heterotrimer assembly experiments, 0.25 µg of each of the normal and mutant plasmids were co-translated. Type X collagen chains were analyzed on 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The samples were routinely denatured at 60°C for 10 min prior to electrophoresis. In some instances, samples were heated at 100°C for 5 min to denature assemblies prior to electrophoresis with or without 10 mM dithiothreitol. Analysis of the NC1 and NC2 domains by bacterial collagenase digestion was performed as described previously (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Type X collagen cDNA constructs were transiently expressed in a rat osteogenic sarcoma cell line, UMR 106-01 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC-CRL 1661), a mouse fibroblast line, 3T3-A31 (ATCC-CCL163), and a monkey COS cell line, CV-1 (ATCC-CCL70) using the vaccinia driven T7 bacteriophage expression system developed by Moss and colleagues (22Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). This system employs initial infection of the cells with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) in which the T7 RNA polymerase gene is under control of the early/late vaccinia P7.5 promoter so that it is continuously expressed resulting in high cytoplasmic levels of T7 polymerase. Subsequent transfection of the cells with cDNA constructs under the control of the T7 promoter in the vector pTM1 allows cytoplasmic transcription of the transfected gene. In brief, 5 × 105 UMR 106-01, 1.8 × 105 CV1 or 3T3-A31 cells were cultured for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 0.25 mM sodium ascorbate. Cells were infected with a T7 polymerase-expressing vaccinia virus vTF7-3 (30 plaque-forming units/cell) for 30 min in 0.5 ml serum-free DMEM, followed by transfection with 2 µg of plasmid which had been complexed with 15 µl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. Transfections were carried out in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM for 6 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The transfection medium was removed and replaced with 1.0 ml of serum-free DMEM, containing 0.25 mM sodium ascorbate and 10 µCi of L-[2,3-3H]proline and incubated for 8 or 18 h at 37°C. At the appropriate time point, the medium fractions were removed, and the cell layers were scraped into 1 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing. The labeled proteins were recovered from both the medium and cell fractions by 75% (v/v) ethanol precipitation and analyzed by 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In some experiments, type X collagen was detected by Western blotting and probed with a type X collagen specific antibody (23Chan D. Cole W.G. Chow C.W. Mundlos S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1747-1753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), generously provided by Dr. Gary Gibson (Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI). In vitro transcription and cell-free translation demonstrated that all the mutant plasmids were translated into preα1(X) chains of molecular weight consistent with the introduced mutations (Fig. 2, lanes 1-6). While no molecular weight change was observed for the Y598D amino acid substitution (Fig. 2, lane 4), both the single base deletion of cytosine 1952 (NC1ΔC) and the 10-base pair deletion (NC1Δ10) of the NC1 domain resulted in shortened preα1(X) chains (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3) when compared with the normal (wt) preα1(X) chain of 680 amino acids (Fig. 2, lane 1). Both these mutations produced codon frameshifts causing premature chain terminations at amino acid 621 for NC1ΔC and 673 for NC1Δ10. Similarly, the electrophoretic migrations of proteins translated from the in-frame deletion mutations, helixΔ and NC2Δ, were consistent with the expected sizes of 397 and 646 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). The site-directed mutations in the NC1 and NC2 domains were confirmed by the analysis of these domains following bacterial collagenase digestion of preα1(X) chains synthesized in the absence of microsomes. The deletion of the NC2 domain in the NC2Δ mutant was clearly demonstrated by its absence in the collagenase digest (Fig. 3, lane 6). The NC1 domains from the NC1ΔC and NC1Δ10 mutants were also markedly reduced in size as expected (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3), whereas the electrophoretic migrations of the NC1 and NC2 domains from the Y598D and helixΔ mutants were unaffected (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 5). While the preα1(X) chains produced do not spontaneously assemble into multimers during in vitro translation, assembly could be induced by incubation in the Ca2+-containing buffer used for collagenase digestion (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A significant proportion of the wt α1(X), helixΔα1(X), and NC2Δα1(X) chains could be induced to assemble into multimers, as evidenced by the presence of multimers of the collagenase-released NC1 domains (Fig. 3, lanes 4-6), however, the mutant NC1 domains were present only as monomers (lanes 1-3). This is consistent with our previous report which demonstrated that a NC1 G618V mutation prevented in vitro multimer assembly (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ability of the mutant type X collagen chains to associate into trimers in vitro was studied further by translation in the presence of canine microsomal membranes. Translocation of the normal and mutant preα1(X) chains into the microsomes was demonstrated by the removal of the signal peptide which resulted in the smaller α1(X) chains for all the plasmids translated (Fig. 2, lanes 7-12). As shown in previous studies (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), under these translation conditions the normal human type X collagen associated into a trimeric component (Fig. 2, lane 11). The helixΔα1(X) and NC2Δα1(X) chains also formed trimers in vitro (Fig. 2, lanes 12 and 7), whereas the NC1 mutants, Y598D (Fig. 2, lane 8), NC1Δ10 (Fig. 2, lane 10), and NC1ΔC (Fig. 2, lane 9) were unable to form trimers in vitro. An important functional consideration is whether the mutant α1(X) chains are able to associate with normal α1(X) into heterotrimers. To determine this, normal and mutant plasmids were co-transcribed and translated in the presence of microsomes. Co-translation of the normal transcript and the helixΔ transcript, which contained a helical deletion but a normal NC1 domain, showed that in addition to the trimeric components of each product, two additional multimer bands labeled as a and b were also observed (Fig. 4, lane 1). The relative electrophoretic migrations of these suggested that band a represented heterotrimers containing two normal α1(X) chains and one helixΔα1(X) chain, while band b was the heterotrimer containing one normal and two helixΔα1(X) chains. The efficient formation of helixΔ heterotrimers with the full-length normal α1(X) chains demonstrated an important practical use of the helixΔ construct as a protein reporter to assess the ability of the mutants to assemble into heterotrimers in further co-translation experiments. If the mutants can assemble with the helixΔ chains, which are shorter but contain a normal NC1 domain, the stoichiometry of these heterotrimers can be readily determined by assessing the electrophoretic migration of the multimers. Co-expression of the helixΔα1(X) reporter construct and the NC2Δα1(X) construct (Fig. 4, lane 8) showed that the NC2Δ mutation allowed assembly of the mutant chain into homotrimers and heterotrimers (lane 8, labeled as c and d, respectively). Molecular weight analysis again indicated that band c represented heterotrimers containing two NC2Δ and one helixΔ chains, while band d was a heterotrimer containing one NC2Δ and two helixΔ chains. In contrast, co-translation of normal α1(X) (wt) with NC1ΔC or NC1Δ10 transcripts showed no evidence of any heterotrimer formation (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). Similarly, no heterotrimers were observed when these two NC1 mutant transcripts were co-translated with helixΔ (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). Mutant transcripts with single amino acid substitutions within the NC1 domain (G618V, Y598D) were also co-translated with the helixΔ reporter to determine if association of normal and mutant NC1 domains occurred in vitro (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7). The predominant multimeric component in each co-translation was the helixΔα1(X) trimer and the two mutants were unable to form homotrimers in vitro. However, a faint band corresponding to species b (Fig. 4, lane 1) was evident with both the G618V and Y598D (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7) and was better demonstrated in an overexposure (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 10). This species corresponds to a mutant:normal heterotrimer containing one mutant NC1 α1(X) chain and two reporter helixΔα1(X) chains. This species was a very minor product (<1%), demonstrating that heterotrimer formation was extremely inefficient. There was no evidence of trimers containing two or three mutant chains. Transient transfection of the normal (wt), helixΔ and NC2Δ plasmids into UMR 106-01, which produce no endogenous type X collagen, demonstrated that these constructs (which contain normal NC1 domains) were expressed and secreted by these cells (Fig. 5, panel a).

https://openalex.org/W1982653754,"The heregulin-ErbB system of ligands and receptors are newly described epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGF receptor-related proteins that regulate growth, differentiation, and gene expression in numerous cell types. This study describes a receptor for heregulin β-1 (HRGβ1) on cultured rat hepatocytes and an inhibitory influence of insulin on HRGβ1 binding. HRGβ1 (30 nM) stimulated DNA synthesis 2-fold and was not augmented by insulin as is the case with EGF receptor ligands. A labeled peptide corresponding to the EGF domain of HRGβ1 bound to a single population of 19,600 ± 1,800 binding sites/cell with a Kd of 360 ± 22 pM. Cross-linking experiments showed binding of HRGβ1 to ErbB3 but not ErbB2 or ErbB4. HRGβ1 induced phosphorylation of ErbB3 and decreased ErbB3 protein levels, suggesting that HRGβ1 activates signaling through the ErbB3 receptor and influences receptor trafficking. Following plating, [125I]HRGβ1 binding and ErbB3 protein levels increased 8- and 3-fold, respectively, over the first 12 h in culture. These increases required de novo protein synthesis and were inhibited with 50 nM insulin resulting in 3500 binding sites with a Kd of 265 pM. These data suggest that the heregulin-ErbB system can regulate liver functions and may be linked to the metabolic and nutritional status of the animal.

Liver regeneration is a striking example of the synchronized proliferation of multiple cell types within a tissue that simultaneously maintains complex metabolic and other differentiated functions. The purpose of our study was to explore the possibility that the heregulins and their receptors are involved in the control of growth or differentiated functions in the liver. We demonstrate that a recombinant peptide corresponding to the EGF domain of the β-1 isoform of heregulin (HRGβ1) bound to rat hepatocytes via the ErbB3 receptor, induced receptor phosphorylation, and stimulated DNA synthesis. HRGβ1 treatment led to decreased levels of ErbB3 in freshly plated hepatocytes in a manner consistent with ligand-mediated down-regulation. Insulin inhibited the up-regulation of ErbB3 in vitro, suggesting a mechanism whereby metabolic controls could modulate proliferative and differentiative signals within liver. Human recombinant HRGβ1 (amino acids 177-244) was prepared as described (4Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). HRGβ1 was iodinated to a specific activity of 250-300 µCi/µg by the lactoperoxidase method (4Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D.

This protein corresponds to the EGF domain of the mature secreted form of HRGβ1 amino acids 177-244. Insulin was from Eli Lily & Co. (Indianapolis, IN). Synthetic rat TGF-α was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories Inc. (Belmont, CA). [125-I]TGF-α was prepared using the chloramine T method as described (22Russell W.E. Dempsey P.J. Sitaric S. Peck A.J. Coffey Jr., R.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1731-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). [3H-methyl]Thymidine (6 Ci/mmol,) was from DuPont NEN and was diluted to 0.36 Ci/mmol with cold thymidine. Thymidine, dexamethasone, pyruvate, bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), percoll, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, and all buffer reagents were from Sigma. Protein G-Sepharose was from Pierce, and ECL reagents and nitrocellulose membranes were from Amersham Corp. Anti-ErbB2 antibodies were from NeoMarkers (Freemont, CA). Anti-ErbB3 and anti-ErbB4 antibodies were from SantaCruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-EGFr antibodies were the kind gift of Dr. H. S. Earp. Williams' Medium E, supplemented with 20 mM pyruvate, 10 nM dexamethasone, and 50 µg/ml gentamicin, was the medium used for all culture studies including binding assays. Medium and calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Type I collagenase was from Waco Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Richmond, VA) and Falcon six-well culture dishes were from Fisher. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g), from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) were housed under conditions of regulated lighting (lights on 0600-1800) and ad libitum access to water and Purina rodent chow (Ralston-Purina, St. Louis, MO). All protocols employed were approved in advance by the Animal Use Subcommittee of the Vanderbilt Animal Care Committee. Hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of 175-250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis IN) with modifications of our previously described methods (32Russell W.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 135: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The livers of ether-anesthetized rats were perfused through the portal vein with a calcium-free solution consisting of 150 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 5.5 mM glucose, and 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.6) for 10 min followed by the same solution containing 3.8 mM CaCl2, 10 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 mg/ml collagenase type I. The cells were dispersed in medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and filtered through 61-µm nylon mesh. The hepatocytes were then purified by a 5-min sedimentation at 1 × g in serum-containing medium followed by centrifugation at 50 × g in isotonic percoll (specific gravity = 1.06) to reduce contamination by nonparenchymal cells (33Kreamer B.L. Staecker J.L. Sawada N. Sattler G.L. Hsia M.T. Pitot H.C. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. Anim. 1986; 22: 201-211Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Percoll was removed by two washes in serum-containing medium, and the hepatocytes were assessed for viability by trypan blue exclusion (> 95% viable). Cells (375,000 cells/well) were plated in type-1 collagen-coated 35-mm wells. After a 30-min attachment period, the serum-containing medium was replaced with 1.5 ml of serum-free medium containing growth factors as indicated. Except where indicated otherwise, after 48 h of stimulation, the cells were refed with medium containing specified growth factors and 1 µCi/ml of [3H-methyl] thymidine (0.36 Ci/mmol). At 72 h the experiment was terminated, and the incorporation of [3H-methyl]thymidine was determined. Cells were fixed and washed free of unincorporated label with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4°C. The cells were then lysed in 1 N NaOH, and the DNA was precipitated by adding perchloric acid to a concentration of 1.5 N. The DNA was hydrolyzed at 90°C for 15 min, and aliquots were taken for scintillation counting and determination of DNA content using Richards' modification of the Burton diphenylamine assay (34Richards G.M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The results of assays in triplicate are expressed as the specific activity of the DNA (dpm/µg DNA ± S.D.). In autoradiography studies, cells incorporated [3H-methyl]thymidine from 12 to 72 h in culture. After incubation, ascorbic acid ([final] = 230 mM) was added for 20 min at room temperature. Then the cells were washed twice in methanol, rehydrated in deionized water, and overlaid with photographic emulsion for 72 h before developing and counterstaining with Giemsa. The results are represented as the percentage of labeled nuclei from a total of at least 300 nuclei. [125I]HRGβ1 binding to cultured hepatocytes was assessed using a modification of our previous method for [125I]EGF binding (32Russell W.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 135: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Moriarity D.M. Savage Jr., C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 203: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After the indicated times and conditions of incubation, hepatocytes were placed at 4°C for 10 min. Medium was then aspirated and replaced with ice-cold binding medium (Williams' medium E containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.35) containing the indicated concentrations of [125I]HRGβ1 with or without unlabeled HRGβ1. After a 4-h binding period at 4°C, the monolayers were washed twice with 2.0 ml of ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.35) and twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then solubilized in 1 ml of NaOH (1 N) and counted (Micromedic Systems; Horsham, PA). The data are expressed as total cpm bound/dish or as the amount of bound HRGβ1 (means of duplicate dishes), corrected for nonspecific binding in the presence of 50-200-fold excess cold HRGβ1. The data were subjected to a Scatchard-type analysis (36Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-665Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) using the program Ligand (37Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Whole rat liver or cultured hepatocytes were lysed in TGH buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl) with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 µM sodium orthovanadate, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin. The indicated amounts of protein lysate were incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies directed toward ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4 receptors or EGF receptor. Complexes were precipitated for 2 h at 4°C with protein G-Sepharose (Pierce). Pellets were washed four times with TGH at room temperature then dissolved in 20 µl 1 × SDS gel sample buffer and heated to 95°C for 5 min. Supernatants were loaded in a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed. Resolved proteins were then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotted with antibodies against EGFr, ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4 receptors. Immunoreactive species were resolved using the ECL method (Amersham Corp.) and exposed to x-ray film for radiography. Films were scanned on a IS-1000 digital densitometer for quantification (Alpha Innotech Corp, SanLeandro, CA). Following perfusion and plating, hepatocytes were incubated at 37°C for 12 h. Cells were then chilled to 4°C and incubated 4 h in binding buffer containing 10 ng/ml [125I]HRGβ1 or [125I]TGF-α with or without a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled HRGβ1 or EGF, respectively. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate was then added to a final concentration of 2 nM, and the cells were incubated for an additional 40 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Tris-HCl to a final concentration of 50 mM. The cells were then washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in TGH lysis buffer (with protease inhibitors). As a control, MCF-7 cells were subjected to the same reaction conditions and analysis. Total protein lysate (100 µg/lane) was electrophoresed in a 6% acrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. 400 µg of hepatocyte lysate was incubated in separate reactions with the above anti-ErbB antibodies. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G, electrophoresed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Hepatocytes were cultured for 12 h and then stimulated for 5 min at 37°C with 300 nM HRGβ1 and lysed in TGH with protease inhibitors (listed above) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium molybdate, 10 mMβ-glycerol phosphate). ErbB3 proteins were immunoprecipitated, transferred to membranes, and blotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (RC20H, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Identical membranes were blotted with anti-ErbB3 antibodies to normalize level of phosphorylation to amount of receptor precipitated. The combination of EGF and insulin can stimulate 60-80% of rat hepatocytes cultured in serum-free medium to undergo at least one round of replicative DNA synthesis with a smaller number actually undergoing mitosis (27McGowan J.A. Strain A.J. Bucher N.L.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 108: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 38Richman R.A. Claus T.H. Pilkis S.J. Friedman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3589-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the effect of increasing concentrations of TGF-α or HRGβ1 on [3H-methyl] thymidine incorporation both alone and in the presence of 150 nM insulin. In contrast to ligands for the EGFr, the effects of HRGβ1 were not appreciably amplified by the presence of 150 nM insulin. In a nuclear labeling assay, maximal stimulatory doses of HRGβ1 (30 nM) stimulated 8.7 ± 0.84% of nuclei to enter S phase by 72 h in culture as compared with 2.6 ± 0.83% of control nuclei (data not shown). The stimulatory effects of HRGβ1 alone and in the presence of 150 nM insulin were completely inhibited by TGFβ1 (data not shown). Initial studies established that binding equilibrium of [125I]HRGβ1 was reached by 4 h at 4°C (data not shown). The specificity of the HRGβ1 binding site in hepatocytes is shown in Fig. 2. Whereas the binding of [125I]HRGβ1 was displaced by unlabeled HRGβ1, 500-fold molar excess concentrations of EGF, TGF-α, or amphiregulin, ligands for the EGFr, were ineffective. As reported by Holmes et al. (4Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), a 500-fold excess of unlabeled HRGβ1 was ineffective in displacing the binding of [125I]TGF-α from the EGFr (data not shown). These results suggest a specific binding site for HRGβ1 on hepatocytes that is distinct from the EGFr. We next sought to determine the influence of hepatocyte isolation and purification on HRGβ1 binding. Previous studies showed that the number of EGF receptors on rat hepatocytes varies dramatically over time in culture (32Russell W.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 135: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Shiota K. Nakamura T. Ichihara A. Biochem. Int. 1986; 13: 893-901PubMed Google Scholar), increasing in freshly isolated cells to 230,000 sites/cell 12 h after plating and then declining rapidly. The estimated EGFr receptor density after 12 h in culture corresponds well with independent estimates made on membranes from whole liver (40Dunn W.A. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 2148-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggesting that cell isolation results in a loss of EGFr that is transiently reversed over the first 12 h in culture. Fig. 3A shows a similar pattern of recovery and decline in [125I]HRGβ1 binding over time in culture. All subsequent estimates of HRG receptor number and affinity were performed on hepatocytes 12 h after plating. To determine if the increase in [125I]HRGβ1 binding requires de novo protein synthesis or is regulated by physiologic signals, binding assays were performed on hepatocytes cultured for 12 h with or without 10 µg/ml cycloheximide or 150 nM insulin. Fig. 3B shows that the increase in [125I]HRGβ1 binding was blocked by cycloheximide and by insulin. Concentrations of insulin as low as 50 nM were able to completely inhibit the increase in HRGβ1 binding (data not shown). Hepatocyte HRGβ1 binding sites could be saturated at 4°C. Fig. 4 shows the binding of increasing amounts of [125I]HRGβ1 and the data resulting from Scatchard-type analysis using the Ligand program (37Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). A single population of 19,600 ± 1,800 binding sites per cell (mean ± S.D.) with a Kd of 360 ± 22 pM was identified in three separate hepatocyte preparations. Scatchard analysis of HRGβ1 binding to hepatocytes cultured in the presence of insulin revealed that the diminished HRGβ1 binding resulted from fewer binding sites of comparable affinity as control culture (Kd = 263 pM, sites/cell = 3532) (Fig. 4B). To determine if the known components of the HRGβ1 receptor complex are present in rat liver, lysates of cultured hepatocytes and whole liver were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for rat EGFr, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors. Fig. 5 shows that of the proteins analyzed, only the EGFr and ErbB3 were immunodetectable in rat liver at 170 and 180 kDa, respectively. The sensitivity of the ErbB2 antibodies to rat protein was confirmed by the detection of the receptor in the rat hepatoma line H4IIe (data not shown). Following incubation to equilibrium with [125I]HRGβ1 or [125I]TGF-α as described above, ligand-receptor complexes were cross-linked with the cell-membrane impermeable coupling agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, lysed, and electrophoresed for autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 6A, [125I]HRGβ1 was associated with a single major molecular complex of approximately 180 kDa, and this association was completely inhibited in the presence of unlabeled HRGβ1. As a control, [125I]TGF-α was cross-linked to a single major species of 160 kDa and was competed with unlabeled EGF. Anti-ErbB2, anti-ErbB3, anti-ErbB4, and anti-EGFr antibodies were then used to identify the components of the [125I]HRGβ1 binding site in hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 6B, only anti-ErbB3 antibodies precipitated a radioactive 180-kDa species from a lysate of hepatocytes cross-linked to [125I]HRGβ1. As a control, anti-EGFr antibody was used to immunoprecipitate [125I]TGF-α cross-linked to cultured rat hepatocytes, yielding a radioactive 170-kDa species. Taken together, these results suggest that ErbB3 is the primary binding protein in rat hepatocyte HRG receptors. After 12 h of incubation, hepatocytes were stimulated for 5 min with 300 nM HRGβ1 at 37°C. Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed more than a 2-fold increase in the phosphotyrosine content of ErbB3 stimulated with HRGβ1 as compared with controls or insulin-treated ErbB3. (Fig. 7) Hepatocytes were incubated for 8 h with HRGβ1, insulin, or EGF. Fig. 8, Fig. 9 show that within 8-12 h under control conditions, ErbB3 protein expression increased 2-3-fold, consonant with the observed increase in HRGβ1 binding. Both HRGβ1 (Fig. 8) and insulin (Fig. 9A) and to a lesser extent EGF (Fig. 8) inhibited the increase in ErbB3 protein levels. Neither insulin (Fig. 9B) nor HRGβ1 (data not shown) affected EGFr expression. In three separate hepatocyte preparations, HRGβ1 or insulin treatment resulted in ErbB3 expression that was 25 ± 2 or 32 ± 10% of controls, respectively. These results are consistent with a down-regulation of ErbB3 by HRGβ1 in a ligand-dependent manner and suggests that the depressed HRGβ1 binding induced by insulin results from a decrease in the expression of ErbB3 protein.Fig. 9Inhibition of ErbB3 protein expression by insulin in cultured hepatocytes. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were incubated at 37°C for 12 h with (▪) or without (□) 150 nM insulin (Ins).

We questioned whether the heregulin system of ligands and receptors is important in the control of liver growth and function. HRGβ1 at 30 nM stimulated DNA synthesis about 2-fold and was not augmented by insulin. This is in contrast to TGF-α, which at 10 nM stimulated a 30-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation and was augmented at lower concentrations by insulin. Relative to TGF-α, which stimulates labeling of 80-85% of nuclei in cultured hepatocytes, HRGβ1 stimulated only 6% of the nuclei, suggesting possible compartmentalization of HRG-sensitive hepatocytes (42Gebhardt R. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1988; 151: 8-18Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and an underestimation of the number of binding sites per cell. Alternately, heregulins may not be primary mitogens in rat liver but could regulate differentiation during development, maintenance of differentiated functions during regeneration, or metabolism in response to nutritional status. HRGβ1 binds a specific receptor on rat hepatocytes that is distinct from the EGFr, as described previously in other cell types (4Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 43Shoyab M. Plowman G.D.

In a wide variety of cells, heregulin appears to bind ErbB3 or ErbB4, but no ligands have been identified that directly bind ErbB2 (16Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C.

In contrast, COS-7 cells co-transfected with ErbB2 and ErbB3 showed a Kd of 0.13 nM (17Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, hepatocytes were shown to have approximately 20,000 HRG binding sites per cell with a Kd of 0.36±.02 nM, a dissociation constant intermediate between those shown in cells transfected with ErbB3 or ErbB4 alone and those co-transfected with ErbB2 and ErbB3. Of these three receptors, only ErbB3 was immunodetectable in rat hepatocytes and appears to be at least one component of the hepatic HRGβ1 receptor. Subsequent reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis failed to detect mRNA corresponding to ErbB2 or ErbB4 in adult rat liver (data not shown). Labeled HRGβ1 chemically cross-linked to hepatocyte plasma membranes was immunoprecipitated in a 180-kDa complex only with antibodies to ErbB3, consonant with a primary role for ErbB3 in hepatocyte HRG signaling. Stimulation with HRGβ1 led to phosphorylation of ErbB3 receptors in hepatocytes within 5 min. Hepatocytes cultured as briefly as 2 h in the presence of HRGβ1 expressed lower levels of ErbB3 compared with control or EGF-treated cells consistent with ligand-mediated down-regulation. However, further experimentation is required to fully elucidate the mechanics of receptor-ligand trafficking after HRG binding in hepatocytes. The origins of the up-regulation of ErbB3 protein following hepatocyte isolation are unclear but may be associated with the induction of immediate early genes that is observed in hepatocyte cultures (46Rana B. Mischoulon D. Xie Y. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5858-5869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies do not yet define the entire hepatocyte heregulin receptor complex, which is presumed to include at least one other ErbB species. Several lines of evidence suggest that ErbB3 requires the association of other ErbB receptors or the EGFr to form an active signaling complex in hepatocytes: (a) the previously cited data indicating that heterodimers of ErbB2 and ErbB3 constitute high affinity HRG binding sites in transfected cells, whereas monomers of ErbB3 exhibit low affinity binding (17Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) the demonstration that despite its homology to other tyrosine kinase receptors, ErbB3 has weak or nonexistent kinase activity due to an Asp → Asn substitution in the catalytic site of the otherwise highly conserved kinase domain (47Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar); (c) the demonstration that ErbB3 is known to be a substrate of ErbB2, ErbB4, and the EGFr and can designate the signal transduction pathway(s) activated following ligand binding (15Earp H.S. Dawson T.L. Li X. Yu H. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 35: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 18Alimandi M. Romano A. Curia M.C. Muraro R. Fedi P. Aaronson S.A. Di Fiore P.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). For example, activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate kinase by EGFr has been recently shown to be dependent upon the intermediacy of ErbB3, which contains seven repeats of the binding motif specific for the p85 subunit of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate kinase (48Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In Ba/F3 cells transfected with EGFr and ErbB3, heregulin treatment resulted in phosphorylation of both receptors, suggesting that ErbB3 can be a substrate for the EGFr kinase in a heregulin-induced ErbB3/EGFr heterodimer (49Riese D.J. van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). No data exist to speculate on the possible influence of the EGFr on ErbB3 affinity for HRG in heteromeric complexes. We were unable to demonstrate any high molecular weight species consistent with ErbB multimers from cross-linked hepatocyte lysates, presumably due to relatively low levels of receptor expression as compared with transformed or transfected cell lines. However, the data in Fig. 8 suggest that EGF may also influence ErbB3 expression in a fashion similar to HRGβ1, perhaps due to internalization of ErbB3 and EGFr heterodimers. Heterodimerization with EGFr may explain the mechanism of ErbB3 phosphorylation and high affinity binding in our model. Current studies aim to identify the other proteins involved in HRG binding and signaling in hepatocytes and other liver cells. Insulin regulation of hepatic HRG binding and ErbB3 expression is of potential physiological significance. Insulin continuously bathes the liver through the portal circulation and is a mitogen for hepatocytes in vitro, acting synergistically with glucagon, EGF, and other peptide growth factors to stimulate DNA synthesis in cultured hepatocytes and regenerating liver (27McGowan J.A. Strain A.J. Bucher N.L.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 108: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 38Richman R.A. Claus T.H. Pilkis S.J. Friedman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although HRGβ1-mediated DNA synthesis was not significantly augmented by insulin, the inhibitory effect of insulin on ErbB3 protein expression and HRGβ1 binding in cultured hepatocytes was striking. Insulin could affect ErbB3 expression directly or down-regulate the receptor by inducing the secretion of a ligand. Insulin may prove to regulate the expression of ErbB3 protein and HRG binding in vivo because the concentrations of insulin effective in inhibiting ErbB3 expression were within physiological ranges detected in the portal vein (51Bucher N.L. Swaffield M.N. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1975; 13: 281-293PubMed Google Scholar, 52Helman A. Castaing D. Morin J. Pfister-Lemaire N. Assan R. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E544-E547PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that insulin, perhaps with other hormones and growth factors, may permit complex nutritional or metabolic controls to influence the intensity or duration of growth and differentiative signals generated by activated ErbB3 receptors. Our purpose in this study was to describe the interaction of a recently described ErbB ligand, heregulin, with hepatocytes. This ligand has been purified from human breast cancer cells and ras-transformed rat fibroblasts, but transcripts have been detected in normal human liver as well (4Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Here we show that the HRGβ1 isoform of heregulin can stimulate DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes and binds to ErbB3, but the current studies do not define the role played by this ligand-receptor system in liver physiology. As has been reported in the case of astrocytes in culture, heregulin may act as a survival and/or differentiation factor for hepatocytes (53Pinkas-Kramarski R. Eilam R. Spiegler O. Lavi S. Liu N. Chang D. Wen D. Schwartz M. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9387-9391Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways and cellular responses that result from activation of ErbB3 are currently under study in this laboratory. These studies set the groundwork for the clarification of the role of the heregulins and their receptors in the normal growth and function of the liver, and their possible involvement in the proliferative response to injury and partial hepatectomy, in the acute phase response, and in the development of hepatic neoplasia.

https://openalex.org/W2101588726,"O-Acetylation and de-O-acetylation of sialic acids have been implicated in the regulation of a variety of biological phenomena, including endogenous lectin recognition, tumor antigenicity, virus binding, and complement activation. Applying a strategy designed to identify genes preferentially expressed in active sites of embryonic hematopoiesis, we isolated a novel cDNA from the pluripotent hematopoietic cell line FDCPmixA4 whose open reading frame contained sequences homologous to peptide fragments of a lysosomal sialic acid O-acetylesterase (Lse) previously purified from rat liver, but with no evident similarity to endoplasmic reticulum-derived acetylesterases. The expressed Lse protein exhibits sialic-acid O-acetylesterase activity that is not attributable to a typical serine esterase active site. lse expression is spatially and temporally restricted during embryogenesis, and its mRNA levels correlate with differences in O-acetylesterase activity described in adult tissues and blood cell types. Using interspecific backcross analysis, we further mapped the lse gene to the central region of mouse chromosome 9. This constitutes the first report on the molecular cloning of a sialic acid-specific O-acetylesterase in vertebrates and suggests novel roles for the 9-O-acetyl modification of sialic acids during the development and differentiation of mammalian organisms."

These three mutations are of particular interest because, unlike rpoB8, they do not increase termination at all ρ-dependent and ρ-independent terminators. rpoB211 and rpoB212 both change Asn-1072 to His in conserved region H of rpoB (βN1072H), whereas rpoC214 changes Arg-352 to Cys in conserved region C of rpoC (β′R352C). Both substitutions significantly reduce the overall rate of transcript elongation in vitro relative to wild-type RNA polymerase; however, they probably slow elongation for different reasons. The nucleotide triphosphate concentrations required at the T7 A1 promoter for both abortive trinucleotide synthesis and for promoter escape are much greater for βN1072H. In contrast, β′R352C and two adjacent substitutions (β′G351S and β′S350F), but not βN1072H, formed open complexes of greatly reduced stability.

https://openalex.org/W2077336117,"The role played by the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond of trimethylamine dehydrogenase in the reductive half-reaction of the enzyme has been studied by following the reaction of the slow substrate diethylmethylamine with a C30A mutant of the enzyme lacking the covalent flavin attachment to the polypeptide. Removal of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond diminishes the limiting rate for the first of the three observed kinetic phases of the reaction by a factor of 6, but has no effect on the rate constants for the two subsequent kinetic phases. The flavin in the C30A enzyme recovered from the reaction of the C30A enzyme with excess substrate is found to have been converted to the 6-hydroxy derivative, rendering the enzyme inactive. The noncovalently bound FMN of the C30A mutant enzyme is also converted to 6-hydroxy-FMN and rendered inactive upon reduction with excess trimethylamine, but not by reduction with dithionite, even at high pH or in the presence of the effector tetramethylammonium chloride. These results suggest that one significant role of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond is to prevent the inactivation of the enzyme during catalysis. A reaction mechanism is proposed whereby OH− attacks C-6 of a flavin-substrate covalent adduct in the course of steady-state turnover to form 6-hydroxy-FMN. The role played by the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond of trimethylamine dehydrogenase in the reductive half-reaction of the enzyme has been studied by following the reaction of the slow substrate diethylmethylamine with a C30A mutant of the enzyme lacking the covalent flavin attachment to the polypeptide. Removal of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond diminishes the limiting rate for the first of the three observed kinetic phases of the reaction by a factor of 6, but has no effect on the rate constants for the two subsequent kinetic phases. The flavin in the C30A enzyme recovered from the reaction of the C30A enzyme with excess substrate is found to have been converted to the 6-hydroxy derivative, rendering the enzyme inactive. The noncovalently bound FMN of the C30A mutant enzyme is also converted to 6-hydroxy-FMN and rendered inactive upon reduction with excess trimethylamine, but not by reduction with dithionite, even at high pH or in the presence of the effector tetramethylammonium chloride. These results suggest that one significant role of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond is to prevent the inactivation of the enzyme during catalysis. A reaction mechanism is proposed whereby OH− attacks C-6 of a flavin-substrate covalent adduct in the course of steady-state turnover to form 6-hydroxy-FMN. Trimethylamine dehydrogenase from the restricted facultative methylotroph Methylophilus methylotrophus is composed of two identical 83,000-Da subunits. Each subunit contains 1 eq of FMN and a ferredoxin-type 4Fe-4S cluster along with 1 eq of ADP of unknown function (1Steenkamp D.J. McIntire W.S. Kenney W.C. J. Biol.

The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of trimethylamine as follows: (CH3)3N + H2O ⇌ (CH3)2NH + HCHO + 2H++ 2e−. During catalysis, the FMN of trimethylamine dehydrogenase takes up 2 reducing eq from the substrate and subsequently transfers them one at a time via its 4Fe-4S center to the physiological oxidant for the reaction, electron-transferring flavoprotein (7Duplessis E.R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of trimethylamine dehydrogenase has been determined (13Lim L.W. Shamala N. Mathews F.S. Steenkamp D.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11887-11892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FMN is covalently linked to Cys-30 of the large N-terminal domain as the 6-cysteinyl derivative, while the iron-sulfur center is located close to the central domain. The 8α-methyl of FMN and the closest cysteinyl sulfur atom of the iron-sulfur center are only 4 Å apart (13Lim L.W. Shamala N. Mathews F.S. Steenkamp D.J. Hamlin R. Xuong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15140-15146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two groups are sufficiently close that in the presence of excess substrate or tetramethylammonium chloride (a known inhibitor of the enzyme (15Steenkamp D.J. Beinert H. McIntire W. Singer T.P. Singer T.P. Ondarza R.N. Mechanisms of Oxidizing Enzymes. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1978: 127Google Scholar)) or at high pH, the unpaired electron spins of the flavin semiquinone and the reduced iron-sulfur center of the two-electron reduced enzyme interact strongly to give a triplet-like state that exhibits a complex EPR signal at g = 2 and an intense half-field (g = 4) signal (11Rohlfs R.J. Huang L. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase with the slow substrate diethylmethylamine has been investigated, and the reaction is found to exhibit three well resolved kinetic phases (9Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the fast kinetic phase, the absorbance at 450 nm attributable to oxidized FMN is lost in a process that has been interpreted as giving rise to a covalent flavin-substrate adduct. The intermediate kinetic phase represents the breakdown of this covalent adduct and the subsequent rapid intramolecular electron transfer of one electron from the flavin hydroquinone thus formed to the iron-sulfur center. The slow kinetic phase has been interpreted as representing the dissociation of product followed by the binding of a second substrate molecule to the two-electron reduced enzyme, a process that coincides with the formation of the spin-interacting state (9Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidative half-reaction has also been studied using various forms of trimethylamine dehydrogenase and electron-transferring flavoprotein (10Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been shown that electrons are transferred from trimethylamine dehydrogenase to electron-transferring flavoprotein via the iron-sulfur center of the former with a limiting rate constant of 172 s−1 (at pH 7.0 and 25°C); this step is thus not rate-limiting in catalysis (10Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the FMN in trimethylamine dehydrogenase is covalently attached to Cys-30 via C-6 of the flavin ring by a 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond (1Steenkamp D.J. McIntire W.S. Kenney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2818-2824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Steenkamp D.J. Singer T.P. Beinert H. Biochem. J. 1978; 169: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Kenny W.C. McIntire W. Steenkamp D.J. Benisek W.F. FEBS Lett. 1978; 85: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When Cys-30 of the enzyme is replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant enzyme contains the full complement of 4Fe-4S and ADP, but only ~30% of the full complement of (now noncovalently bound) FMN (18Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Packman L.C. Mewies M. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13186-13191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To the extent that the C30A mutant possesses FMN, however, the mutant enzyme is catalytically active, albeit somewhat compromised. Steady-state kinetic experiments show that the removal of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond increases the apparent Km for trimethylamine by a factor of 100 and decreases the apparent kcat by a factor of 2 (18Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state analysis, however, does not provide direct information about the role of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond in accelerating any of the specific steps of the reductive half-reaction. In this study, we have investigated the reaction of C30A mutant trimethylamine dehydrogenase with diethylmethylamine in order to examine in greater detail the role of the covalent flavin linkage in catalysis. Escherichia coli strain JM109 transformed with the plasmid pSV2tmdvegC30A was grown, and C30A mutant trimethylamine dehydrogenase was purified as described by Scrutton et al. (18Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of 197.1 mM−1 cm−1 at 280 nm, which is calculated from native trimethylamine dehydrogenase. Routine enzyme assays were performed as described previously (9Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diethylmethylamine was purchased from Aldrich, and potassium phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, trimethylamine chloride, FMN, and riboflavin were obtained from Sigma. Sodium dithionite was obtained from Virginia Chemicals. Ferricenium hexafluorophosphate was prepared as described by Lehman et al. (20Lehman T.C. Hale D.E. Bhala A. Thorpe C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 21Lehman T.C. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10594-10602Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state studies were carried out using a Kinetic Instruments stopped-flow apparatus equipped with an On-Line Instruments System Model 3920Z data collection system. Anaerobic solutions of oxidized C30A mutant trimethylamine dehydrogenase were prepared by alternately evacuating and flushing with O2-free argon in a tonometer equipped with a side arm cuvette and a three-way stopcock valve possessing a male Luer connector. Anaerobic solutions of diethylmethylamine were prepared by bubbling buffer solution with O2-free argon for 30 min in a 10-ml volume glass syringe and then injecting an appropriate volume of diethylmethylamine to give a final concentration of 20 mM. The glass syringe was equipped with a three-way valve to allow serial dilution of the diethylmethylamine stock solution thus prepared. The final concentrations of diethylmethylamine after mixing were between 1.25 and 10 mM, sufficient to ensure pseudo first-order conditions in the present stopped-flow experiments. Kinetic transients were obtained as transmittance voltage as a function of time, converted to absorbance change using On-Line Instruments System software, and fitted to the sum of exponentials using an iterative nonlinear least-squares Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (22Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969: 235Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of removal of the covalent 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond on the reductive half-reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase, the kinetics of the reaction of C30A mutant trimethylamine dehydrogenase with diethylmethylamine was examined. This slow substrate for native trimethylamine dehydrogenase has the advantage that several well resolved kinetic phases are observed in the course of its reaction with enzyme (9Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with native trimethylamine dehydrogenase, the reaction of the C30A mutant enzyme with diethylmethylamine at pH 8.0 exhibits three well resolved kinetic phases (Fig. 1). The transient observed at 362 nm consists of only the two slower kinetic phases (Fig. 1A), while that observed at 410 nm consists of the two faster kinetic phases (Fig. 1B); the transient observed at 450 nm contains all three kinetic phases (Fig. 1C). The observed rate constants for each kinetic phase, designated as kfast, kint, and kslow, respectively, are each independent of observation wavelength. kfast exhibits hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of diethylmethylamine, and a fit of the data to the equation kobs = (klim[S])/(Kd+ [S]) (23Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) gives values for klim and Kd of 80 s−1 and 5.0 mM, respectively (Fig. 2). This Kd (at pH 8.0) is within experimental error of the value seen with native trimethylamine dehydrogenase (4.3 mM) (9Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the value of klim exhibited by C30A at pH 8.0 is ~6-fold smaller than that observed with the native enzyme. 1The smaller limiting rate constant for the C30A mutant enzyme is not due to the 30% of the full complement of FMN because the deflavoenzyme is catalytically inert in these experiments. kint and kslow for the C30A mutant are both independent of diethylmethylamine concentration and have values of 6 and 0.2 s−1, respectively, comparable to the values seen with the native enzyme (3.5 and 0.2 s−1). At pH 6, klim/Kd for the fast kinetic phase is 0.05 mM−1 s−1, 40-fold smaller than that observed for the native enzyme at the same pH (2.1 mM−1 s−1), indicating that the removal of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond has a comparatively larger effect as the pH is lowered.Fig. 2Diethylmethylamine concentration dependence of the observed rate constants for the fast kinetic phase. The observed rate constants for the fast kinetic phase at pH 8.0 are plotted versus the concentration of diethylmethylamine after mixing. The closed circles represent kfast measured at 450 nm. The solid line represents the fit of the data to the hyperbolic function kobs = (klim[diethylmethylamine])/(Kd+ [diethylmethylamine]). The fitted values of klim and Kd are 80 s−1 and 5.0 mM, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Spectra for intermediates seen in the course of the reaction of C30A trimethylamine dehydrogenase with diethylmethylamine (Fig. 3B) were calculated from the spectral changes associated with each of the three kinetic phases (Fig. 3A). The overall kinetic difference spectrum obtained from the stopped-flow experiment is consistent with the static difference spectrum observed upon the reduction of the C30A mutant enzyme with diethylmethylamine, indicating that there is no absorbance change in the dead time of the stopped-flow apparatus. The absorbance change associated with the fast kinetic phase is small below 380 nm, but is negative between 380 and 530 nm (Fig. 3A, closed circles). This spectral change seen with the C30A mutant is quite different from that associated with the fast phase seen with the native enzyme (9Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is typical of that observed upon reduction of normal FMN (as opposed to the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN found in the native enzyme). These results indicate that the fast phase represents bleaching of the enzyme FMN, presumably due to transient formation of a substrate-flavin covalent adduct as has been proposed with the native enzyme (9Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The limiting rate constant for this process is 6-fold slower than that observed with the native enzyme, indicating that the formation of the covalent 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond facilitates this first step of the reaction, but this step is not rate-limiting. The spectral change for the intermediate phase (Fig. 3A, open circles), which corresponds to intramolecular electron transfer from the flavin to the 4Fe-4S center, is also different from that seen with the native enzyme in the region of 390-550 nm, again due to changes in the absorbance spectrum of the flavin upon loss of the covalent linkage. The spectral deconvolution for the intermediate phase into components due to flavin hydroquinone → semiquinone and Fe/Sox→ Fe/Sred is possible because Δε for the latter process is well defined (10Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the result is shown in Fig. 3C. The difference spectrum for the 4Fe-4S center (Fig. 3C, closed triangles; taken from Ref. 10Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is that observed upon reduction of phenylhydrazine-treated trimethylamine dehydrogenase, a modified enzyme that contains a redox-inert 4α-phenyl-FMN (4Singer T.P. Steenkamp D.J. Kenny W.C. Beinert H. Yagi K. Yamano T. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo1980: 277Google Scholar, 24Nagy J. Kenney W.C. Singer T.P. J. Biol Chem. 1979; 254: 2684-2688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extinction change of the difference spectrum for the intermediate phase (Fig. 3C, closed circles) was obtained using a C30A mutant enzyme concentration of 9.6 µM and a 2-cm light path, taking into account the fact that only 30% of the C30A mutant enzyme contains flavin. The difference spectrum for one-electron oxidation of the reduced noncovalently bound FMNH2 (flavin semiquinone-flavin hydroquinone) (Fig. 3C, open circles) was obtained by subtracting the difference spectrum for the 4Fe-4S center from that for the intermediate phase. The difference spectrum thus obtained has absorbance maxima at 360 and 410 nm, analogous to the ΔA seen for the semiquinone anion-hydroquinone of glucose oxidase (25Massey V. Mathews R.G. Foust G.P. Howell L.G. Williams C.H. Zanetti G. Ronchi S. Sund H. Pyridine Nucleotide-dependent Dehydrogenase. Springer -Verlag, Berlin1970: 393Google Scholar), confirming that the flavin semiquinone formed with the C30A mutant enzyme is the anionic form, as is true of the native enzyme (26Steenkamp D.J. Beinert H. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The spectral change associated with the slow phase (Fig. 3A, closed triangles) has the same shape as that for the intermediate phase (open circles), again as true with the native enzyme. This has been interpreted as indicating a shift in internal oxidation-reduction equilibrium toward full reduction of the 4Fe-4S center concomitant with the formation of the spin-interacting state in this phase of the reaction (9Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon reaction of C30A mutant trimethylamine dehydrogenase with a 10-fold excess of trimethylamine or diethylmethylamine (as in the above experiments) and passage through a G-25 column to reoxidize the enzyme and to remove excess reagents, the absorbance spectrum shown in Fig. 4 (dotted line) was obtained, which is seen to differ significantly from that for the as-isolated C30A mutant enzyme (solid line). The principal change is an absorption increase in the range of 300-450 nm and above 500 nm upon reaction with substrate. The substrate-treated C30A mutant enzyme cannot be reduced with substrate and exhibits negligible activity. Treatment of the C30A mutant enzyme with 0.5 M perchloric acid followed by neutralization and centrifugation results in the release of normal FMN (data not shown). The FMN content in the C30A mutant enzyme thus determined is ~30% of the full complement, consistent with the known flavin content determined by other means (18Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the same procedure was applied to the substrate-treated C30A mutant enzyme, however, a modified flavin was obtained. Fig. 5 shows the spectra for this modified FMN at pH 6 (solid line) and pH 10 (dotted line). The spectrum at pH 6 has an absorption maximum at 420 nm and a shoulder at 454 nm and is identical to that for the neutral form of 6-hydroxyflavin (27Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 28Schöllnhammer G. Hemmerich P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Mayhew S.G. Whitfield C.D. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, the spectrum at pH 10 has absorption maxima at 424 and 584 nm and is the same as the spectrum for the anionic form of 6-hydroxyflavin (27Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 28Schöllnhammer G. Hemmerich P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Mayhew S.G. Whitfield C.D. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the absorption spectrum (Fig. 5, inset) corresponds to a pKa of ~7, within experimental error of that (7.1) for authentic 6-hydroxyflavin (27Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 28Schöllnhammer G. Hemmerich P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Mayhew S.G. Whitfield C.D. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results make it clear that the modified flavin released from the substrate-treated C30A mutant enzyme is 6-hydroxy-FMN. To make sure that 6-hydroxy-FMN is not the hydrolysis product of other flavin derivatives under the strongly acidic conditions of protein denaturation, the substrate-treated C30A mutant protein at pH 7.0 was heated in boiling water for 3 min. Heat treatment also resulted in the release of 6-hydroxy-FMN, indicating that 6-hydroxy-FMN is formed during the treatment of the C30A mutant with substrate and is not a product of hydrolysis in 0.5 M perchloric acid. The most likely mechanism for the formation of 6-OH-FMN is via nucleophilic attack of OH− at flavin C-6. To determine more specifically how 6-hydroxy-FMN is formed in C30A trimethylamine dehydrogenase, the mutant enzyme was reduced with dithionite at pH 7.0 and 10.0, passed through a G-25 column, and reoxidized in air. In neither case was 6-hydroxy-FMN formed, indicating that OH− does not attack the flavin hydroquinone of the reduced enzyme. Similarly, reduction of the C30A mutant enzyme with dithionite in the presence of 3 mM tetramethylammonium chloride, which results in two-electron reduction of the enzyme and formation of the spin-interacting state, does not give 6-hydroxy-FMN, ruling out the possibility that OH− attacks the flavin semiquinone or the spin-interacting state of the two-electron reduced C30A mutant. The data suggest that a reaction intermediate form generated in the course of the reductive half-reaction is particularly susceptible to nucleophilic attack. When C30A trimethylamine dehydrogenase was titrated with stoichiometric diethylmethylamine or trimethylamine at pH 7.0 and passed through a G-25 column, a spectrum similar to that for the as-isolated C30A mutant was obtained, indicating that the noncovalently bound FMN is not quantitatively modified during the first turnover. To determine how many times the C30A mutant of trimethylamine dehydrogenase does turn over prior to inactivation, enzyme assays utilizing excess ferricenium hexafluorophosphate as oxidant were carried out following the reaction at 300 nm. The amount of ferricenium hexafluorophosphate reduced subsequent to the addition of an excess of diethylmethylamine was calculated using its extinction coefficient of 4300 M−1 cm−1 at 300 nm. Because ferricenium hexafluorophosphate can accept only 1 reducing eq and substrate-reduced trimethylamine dehydrogenase possesses 2 reducing eq, the number of enzyme turnovers was obtained by dividing the amount of reduced ferricenium by 2 and by the amount of enzyme used. The results of these experiments (data not shown) indicate that the C30A mutant enzyme turns over approximately nine times before being inactivated. When C30A trimethylamine dehydrogenase was treated with an excess of diethylmethylamine at pH 7.0, immediately passed through a G-25 column, and reoxidized in air, only part of the FMN was modified to 6-hydroxy-FMN. When the C30A mutant was incubated with an excess of diethylmethylamine overnight, however, all the enzyme-bound FMN was modified. On the other hand, when trimethylamine was used instead of diethylmethylamine and the mixture was immediately passed through a G-25 column, all the FMN was modified. These results indicate that the formation of 6-hydroxy-FMN is slow when the C30A mutant enzyme is treated with diethylmethylamine, but faster if trimethylamine is used. It was of interest to see whether other nucleophiles could attack C-6 of the FMN in the C30A mutant enzyme to form other flavin derivatives. When oxidized C30A mutant trimethylamine dehydrogenase was treated with sodium sulfide, a spectrum resembling that for 6-mercaptoflavin (30Massey V. Ghisla S. Yagi K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8103-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 31Massey V. Taylor M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8281-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained, with absorption maxima at 428 and 632 nm (data not shown), suggesting that C-6 is also susceptible to the nucleophilic attack by S2−. On the other hand, treatment of oxidized C30A trimethylamine dehydrogenase with potassium cyanide resulted in only partial bleaching of the spectrum between 370 and 520 nm. The spectrum of the oxidized C30A mutant was obtained upon reoxidation with air. Also, treatment of the C30A mutant protein with excess trimethylamine in the presence of potassium cyanide resulted in the formation of 6-hydroxy-FMN. These results indicate that CN− cannot attack C-6 of FMN to form 6-CN-FMN. Similarly, treatment of the oxidized C30A mutant with sodium sulfite and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the absence or presence of trimethylamine did not result in the formation of flavin derivatives. As is seen for native trimethylamine dehydrogenase, when the C30A mutant enzyme is reduced with dithionite in the presence of tetramethylammonium chloride, the unpaired electron spins of the flavin semiquinone and the reduced iron-sulfur center interact strongly to give rise to a spin-interacting state that exhibits an intense g = 4 EPR signal (18Scrutton N.S.

To determine whether the unpaired electron spin of 6-hydroxy-FMN semiquinone can interact with that of the reduced iron-sulfur center, the substrate-treated C30A mutant enzyme was reduced with dithionite in the presence of tetramethylammonium chloride. No g = 4 EPR signal was observed, indicating that when FMN is modified to form 6-hydroxy-FMN, the unpaired electron spins of the two prosthetic groups cannot interact to give a spin-interacting state. Similar to the reaction of native trimethylamine dehydrogenase with diethylmethylamine, the reaction of the C30A enzyme with this slow substrate is found to exhibit three kinetic phases, with only kfast dependent on the concentration of diethylmethylamine. The spectral change associated with the fast phase reflects reduction of the noncovalently bound FMN upon reaction with substrate. The spectral change associated with the intermediate phase represents intramolecular electron transfer from flavin hydroquinone to the iron-sulfur center, leaving flavin semiquinone anion. As with the native enzyme, the slow phase represents a small amount of additional electron transfer associated with the spin-interacting state. The mechanism of the C30A enzyme with diethylmethylamine thus appears to be fundamentally the same as with the native enzyme. The Kd for diethylmethylamine in the fast phase of the reaction has the same value for both the native and C30A mutant enzymes, indicating that the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond has no effect on substrate binding. On the other hand, the value of klim for the fast phase of the reaction of the C30A enzyme with diethylmethylamine is ~6-fold smaller than that with the native enzyme, demonstrating that the removal of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond slows down the first step of the reductive half-reaction. The values of kint and kslow for the reaction of C30A trimethylamine dehydrogenase with diethylmethylamine are comparable to those with the native enzyme, indicating that the removal of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond has a minimal effect on the later steps in the catalytic sequence. It is to be emphasized that the first, mutation-sensitive step of the reductive half-reaction is not rate-limiting, and so the kinetic effect of loss of covalent flavin attachment is minimal. This work demonstrates that the noncovalently bound FMN of the C30A enzyme is modified to form 6-hydroxy-FMN, and the enzyme becomes inactive after approximately nine turnovers. It is thus evident that one significant role for the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond in native trimethylamine dehydrogenase is to prevent enzyme inactivation in the course of catalysis. The formation of 6-hydroxy-FMN seen during turnover with the C30A enzyme appears not to be due to an increase in solvent accessibility of the flavin as the active site is already quite accessible to solvent. Similarly, inactivation is not due to simple reduction of flavin in the course of catalysis as the C30A enzyme is not modified upon reduction with excess dithionite at either pH 7.0 or 10.0. Formation of the spin-interacting state does not result in formation of 6-hydroxy-FMN either since the C30A enzyme is unchanged upon reduction with dithionite in the presence of tetramethylammonium chloride. The most likely mechanism whereby 6-hydroxy-FMN is formed is via nucleophilic attack of HO− at flavin C-6 in a manner similar to the cysteine thiolate attack that is thought to give rise to the covalent adduct of the native enzyme (18Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the above in mind, however, it must be a catalytic intermediate that is susceptible to nucleophilic attack, not simply oxidized or reduced flavin. We suggest that it is the covalent flavin-substrate adduct previously proposed (9Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is the form rendered susceptible to nucleophilic attack, as shown in Scheme 1. The covalent flavin-substrate adduct being the species susceptible to nucleophilic attack also provides a rationale as to why formation of 6-hydroxy-FMN occurs faster with trimethylamine than with diethylmethylamine. It is possible that formation of 6-hydroxy-FMN in the course of steady-state assays accounts for the large apparent value of Km observed with C30A trimethylamine dehydrogenase (18Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of trimethylamine dehydrogenase shows that the flavin ring is distinctly nonplanar, bending 20° about the N-5/N-10 axis of the isoalloxazine ring (13Lim L.W. Shamala N. Mathews F.S. Steenkamp D.J. Hamlin R. Xuong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15140-15146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bellamy H.D. Lim L.W. Mathews F.S. Dunham W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11887-11892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the nonplanarity of the flavin ring may facilitate the reductive half-reaction of the enzyme by raising the flavin reduction potential and may be due in part to the 6-S-cysteinyl linkage (18Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the removal of the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond slows down the initial reaction of substrate with the enzyme-bound FMN, but not the overall reductive half-reaction because the rate of the rate-limiting step is unchanged. The modest effect seen for the C30A mutant enzyme on the limiting rate constant for the fast phase of the reaction with diethylmethylamine indicates that while the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond may increase the FMN reduction potential, the effect is not profound from a kinetic standpoint. It appears instead that one major role of the covalent linkage is simply to prevent the formation of 6-hydroxy-FMN in the active site of trimethylamine dehydrogenase so that it does not become inactive under multiple turnover conditions. In this sense, it is possible that the covalent attachment found in the native enzyme is more appropriately thought of as an effect of other factors related to the flavin-binding site that renders (perhaps coincidentally) C-6 susceptible to nucleophilic attack, rather than a principal cause of the chemistry exhibited by the flavin that facilitates catalysis. As is seen for native and recombinant wild-type trimethylamine dehydrogenases, the unpaired electron spins of the noncovalently bound flavin semiquinone and the reduced iron-sulfur center in the C30A mutant enzyme can interact to give rise to a spin-interacting state (18Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that the 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN bond does not play an important role in the formation of the spin-interacting state. When the ferredoxin-type 4Fe-4S center in the native enzyme is modified to an EPR-active iron-sulfur center by treatment of the native enzyme with ferricenium hexafluorophosphate at pH 10, the unpaired electron spin of the modified iron-sulfur center cannot interact with that of the flavin semiquinone. 2L. Huang, R. J. Rohlfs, and R. Hille, unpublished data. Similarly, when the FMN in the C30A mutant enzyme is modified to 6-hydroxy-FMN, the unpaired electron spins of 6-hydroxyflavin semiquinone and the reduced iron-sulfur center no longer interact. All these results suggest that both the ferredoxin-type 4Fe-4S center and unmodified FMN are necessary for the formation of the spin-interacting state. We thank Dr. Paul Fitzpatrick and Emma K.

https://openalex.org/W1986886023,"Numerous effects of tumor necrosis factor are signaled by its 55-kDa receptors. Studying their expression we found that the level of receptor mRNA was decreased during the phorbol ester-induced differentiation of myelomonocytic cell lines. While only minor changes in transcription were noted, the half-life of receptor mRNA in the differentiated cells was markedly decreased, indicating the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, formation of complexes between radiolabeled receptor mRNA and cellular proteins was observed. The decrease in receptor mRNA levels during phorbol ester-induced differentiation was paralleled by a change in the pattern of those complexes. Protein-RNA interaction was selective, as it was not competed by unrelated RNAs. Yet, certain mRNAs that contain AU-rich sequences, known to be involved in the control of their stability, did compete with the receptor mRNA, although the latter is devoid of such sequences. A region of 18 nucleotides within its coding region was found to contain an element essential for the formation of all complexes and sufficient for the formation of those with lower molecular mass. Adjacent bases were required in addition for the formation of the complexes with higher molecular mass. The results suggest that proteins interacting with this region of the 55-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor mRNA contribute to the regulation of its expression."
