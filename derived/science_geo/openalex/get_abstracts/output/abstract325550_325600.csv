Once this hypophysealgonad reaction is started it can not continue indefinitely with adequate light but only until the hypophysis falters in the production of the gonad-stimulating hormone through causes unknown. The immature pheasant resembles the adult at the close of the breeding season in that the gonads are capable of responding to adequate hypophyseal stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1976567287,"A geothermal resource that consists of hot water at moderate temperatures (below 125 degrees C) underlies many areas in the central and eastern United States. Programs funded by the Department of Energy have revealed that this resource is definable and economically competitive with conventional fuels for use in direct heat applications. The resource, therefore, has the potential for reducing our dependence on the imported oil used for space heating. However, front-end costs and risks to explore, drill, test, and evaluate the magnitude of the resource have inhibited development. The question is, therefore, how much federal stimulation will be needed to convince private capital to exploit this widespread low-quality energy source."

The present tendency is to work primarily on problems of an immediate practical importance. With the basic farm crops the immediate end in view is to make China self-sufficient. There is, however, in China a growing appreciation of the value of agricultural research as one means of helping to develop efficiency in agriculture."
