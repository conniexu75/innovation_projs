https://openalex.org/W1984791165,"Cells respond to suboptimal microenvironments by activating stress signaling pathways, like the unfolded protein response and hypoxia-induced transcription factors HIF-1/2, to restore homeostasis. Both cytoprotective pathways have been well studied in isolation at the biochemical and molecular levels. Mounting evidence reveals that they can be activated simultaneously in tumor cells and, likely, in other tissues experiencing inadequate microenvironments and that they share some transcriptional targets, like the proangiogenic factor VEGFA. However, the potential interaction between these pathways is poorly understood. Cell culture experiments revealed that as a consequence of unfolded protein response activation, ATF4 bound to the human VEGFA promoter and activated its transcription, whereas HIF-1 did so in response to hypoxia. When both pathways were activated together, VEGFA transcripts were induced to a higher level than when either stress was applied alone. Surprisingly, this was not due to the combined actions of the stress pathway-specific transcription factors. Instead, we found that endoplasmic reticulum stress potentiated HIF-1 activity to transactivate VEGF expression as well as another well characterized target, BNIP3. These data reveal an unexpected interaction between two important cytoprotective responses that are likely to have significant consequences in environmentally compromised tissues and tumor cells."

The identification of the chemical forms of iron (the speciation) circulating in and between cells is crucial to further understand the mechanisms of iron delivery to its final targets. Here we analyzed how iron is transported to the seeds by the chemical identification of iron complexes that are delivered to embryos, followed by the biochemical characterization of the transport of these complexes by the embryo, using the pea (Pisum sativum) as a model species. We have found that iron circulates as ferric complexes with citrate and malate (Fe(III)3Cit2Mal2, Fe(III)3Cit3Mal1, Fe(III)Cit2). Because dicotyledonous plants only transport ferrous iron, we checked whether embryos were capable of reducing iron of these complexes. Indeed, embryos did express a constitutively high ferric reduction activity. Surprisingly, iron(III) reduction is not catalyzed by the expected membrane-bound ferric reductase. Instead, embryos efflux high amounts of ascorbate that chemically reduce iron(III) from citrate-malate complexes. In vitro transport experiments on isolated embryos using radiolabeled (55)Fe demonstrated that this ascorbate-mediated reduction is an obligatory step for the uptake of iron(II). Moreover, the ascorbate efflux activity was also measured in Arabidopsis embryos, suggesting that this new iron transport system may be generic to dicotyledonous plants. Finally, in embryos of the ascorbate-deficient mutants vtc2-4, vtc5-1, and vtc5-2, the reducing activity and the iron concentration were reduced significantly. Taken together, our results identified a new iron transport mechanism in plants that could play a major role to control iron loading in seeds."
https://openalex.org/W2141978377,"Integrin-based mechanotransduction involves a complex focal adhesion (FA)-associated machinery that is able to detect and respond to forces exerted either through components of the extracellular matrix or the intracellular contractile actomyosin network. Here, we show a hitherto unrecognized regulatory role of vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) in this process. By studying fibroblasts in which vimentin IFs were decoupled from FAs, either because of vimentin deficiency (V0) or loss of vimentin network anchorage due to deficiency in the cytolinker protein plectin (P0), we demonstrate attenuated activation of the major mechanosensor molecule FAK and its downstream targets Src, ERK1/2, and p38, as well as an up-regulation of the compensatory feedback loop acting on RhoA and myosin light chain. In line with these findings, we show strongly reduced FA turnover rates in P0 fibroblasts combined with impaired directional migration, formation of protrusions, and up-regulation of ""stretched"" high-affinity integrin complexes. By exploiting tension-independent conditions, we were able to mechanistically link these defects to diminished cytoskeletal tension in both P0 and V0 cells. Our data provide important new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying cytoskeleton-regulated mechanosensing, a feature that is fundamental for controlled cell movement and tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2160054222,"Background Associations between lifetime traumatic event (LTE) exposures and subsequent physical ill-health are well established but it has remained unclear whether these are explained by PTSD or other mental disorders. This study examined this question and investigated whether associations varied by type and number of LTEs, across physical condition outcomes, or across countries. Methods Cross-sectional, face-to-face household surveys of adults (18+) were conducted in 14 countries (n = 38, 051). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed lifetime LTEs and DSM-IV mental disorders. Chronic physical conditions were ascertained by self-report of physician's diagnosis and year of diagnosis or onset. Survival analyses estimated associations between the number and type of LTEs with the subsequent onset of 11 physical conditions, with and without adjustment for mental disorders. Findings A dose-response association was found between increasing number of LTEs and odds of any physical condition onset (OR 1.5 [95% CI: 1.4–1.5] for 1 LTE; 2.1 [2.0–2.3] for 5+ LTEs), independent of all mental disorders. Associations did not vary greatly by type of LTE (except for combat and other war experience), nor across countries. A history of 1 LTE was associated with 7/11 of the physical conditions (ORs 1.3 [1.2–1.5] to 1.7 [1.4–2.0]) and a history of 5+ LTEs was associated with 9/11 physical conditions (ORs 1.8 [1.3–2.4] to 3.6 [2.0–6.5]), the exceptions being cancer and stroke. Conclusions Traumatic events are associated with adverse downstream effects on physical health, independent of PTSD and other mental disorders. Although the associations are modest they have public health implications due to the high prevalence of traumatic events and the range of common physical conditions affected. The effects of traumatic stress are a concern for all medical professionals and researchers, not just mental health specialists."

It is not clear how the innate immune system effectively discriminates between yeast and hyphal forms of C. albicans. Glucans are major components of the fungal cell wall and key fungal pathogen-associated molecular patterns. C. albicans yeast glucan has been characterized; however, little is known about glucan structure in C. albicans hyphae. Using an extraction procedure that minimizes degradation of the native structure, we extracted glucans from C. albicans hyphal cell walls. 1H NMR data analysis revealed that, when compared with reference (1→3,1→6) β-linked glucans and C. albicans yeast glucan, hyphal glucan has a unique cyclical or “closed chain” structure that is not found in yeast glucan. GC/MS analyses showed a high abundance of 3- and 6-linked glucose units when compared with yeast β-glucan. In addition to the expected (1→3), (1→6), and 3,6 linkages, we also identified a 2,3 linkage that has not been reported previously in C. albicans. Hyphal glucan induced robust immune responses in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages via a Dectin-1-dependent mechanism. In contrast, C. albicans yeast glucan was a much less potent stimulus. We also demonstrated the capacity of C. albicans hyphal glucan, but not yeast glucan, to induce IL-1β processing and secretion. This finding provides important evidence for understanding the immune discrimination between colonization and invasion at the mucosal level. When taken together, these data provide a structural basis for differential innate immune recognition of C. albicans yeast versus hyphae.

https://openalex.org/W2162619600,"Osteocytes have been hypothesized to be the major mechanosensors in bone. How in situ osteocytes respond to mechanical stimuli is still unclear because of technical difficulties. In vitro studies have shown that osteocytes exhibited unique calcium (Ca2+) oscillations to fluid shear. However, whether this mechanotransduction phenomenon holds for in situ osteocytes embedded within a mineralized bone matrix under dynamic loading remains unknown. Using a novel synchronized loading/imaging technique, we successfully visualized in real time and quantified Ca2+ responses in osteocytes and bone surface cells in situ under controlled dynamic loading on intact mouse tibia. The resultant fluid-induced shear stress on the osteocyte in the lacunocanalicular system (LCS) was also quantified. Osteocytes, but not surface cells, displayed repetitive Ca2+ spikes in response to dynamic loading, with spike frequency and magnitude dependent on load magnitude, tissue strain, and shear stress in the LCS. The Ca2+ oscillations were significantly reduced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) depletion and P2 purinergic receptor (P2R)/phospholipase C (PLC) inhibition. This study provides direct evidence that osteocytes respond to in situ mechanical loading by Ca2+ oscillations, which are dependent on the P2R/PLC/inositol trisphosphate/ER pathway. This study develops a novel approach in skeletal mechanobiology and also advances our fundamental knowledge of bone mechanotransduction.—Jing, D., Baik, A. D., Lu, X.

https://openalex.org/W2090696927,"Accurate identification of Arctic plant species is critical for understanding potential climate-induced changes in their diversity and distributions. To facilitate rapid identification we generated DNA barcodes for the core plastid barcode loci (rbcL and matK) for 490 vascular plant species, representing nearly half of the Canadian Arctic flora and 93% of the flora of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Sequence recovery was higher for rbcL than matK (93% and 81%), and rbcL was easier to recover than matK from herbarium specimens (92% and 77%). Distance-based and sequence-similarity analyses of combined rbcL + matK data discriminate 97% of genera, 56% of species, and 7% of infraspecific taxa. There is a significant negative correlation between the number of species sampled per genus and the percent species resolution per genus. We characterize barcode variation in detail in the ten largest genera sampled (Carex, Draba, Festuca, Pedicularis, Poa, Potentilla, Puccinellia, Ranunculus, Salix, and Saxifraga) in the context of their phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy. Discrimination with the core barcode loci in these genera ranges from 0% in Salix to 85% in Carex. Haplotype variation in multiple genera does not correspond to species boundaries, including Taraxacum, in which the distribution of plastid haplotypes among Arctic species is consistent with plastid variation documented in non-Arctic species. Introgression of Poa glauca plastid DNA into multiple individuals of P. hartzii is problematic for identification of these species with DNA barcodes. Of three supplementary barcode loci (psbA–trnH, psbK–psbI, atpF–atpH) collected for a subset of Poa and Puccinellia species, only atpF–atpH improved discrimination in Puccinellia, compared with rbcL and matK. Variation in matK in Vaccinium uliginosum and rbcL in Saxifraga oppositifolia corresponds to variation in other loci used to characterize the phylogeographic histories of these Arctic-alpine species."
https://openalex.org/W2072557743,"Neurospora crassa colonizes burnt grasslands and metabolizes both cellulose and hemicellulose from plant cell walls. When switched from a favored carbon source to cellulose, N. crassa dramatically up-regulates expression and secretion of genes encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes. However, the means by which N. crassa and other filamentous fungi sense the presence of cellulose in the environment remains unclear. Previously, we have shown that a N. crassa mutant carrying deletions of three β-glucosidase enzymes (Δ3βG) lacks β-glucosidase activity, but efficiently induces cellulase gene expression and cellulolytic activity in the presence of cellobiose as the sole carbon source. These observations indicate that cellobiose, or a modified version of cellobiose, functions as an inducer of lignocellulolytic gene expression and activity in N. crassa. Here, we show that in N. crassa, two cellodextrin transporters, CDT-1 and CDT-2, contribute to cellulose sensing. A N. crassa mutant carrying deletions for both transporters is unable to induce cellulase gene expression in response to crystalline cellulose. Furthermore, a mutant lacking genes encoding both the β-glucosidase enzymes and cellodextrin transporters (Δ3βGΔ2T) does not induce cellulase gene expression in response to cellobiose. Point mutations that severely reduce cellobiose transport by either CDT-1 or CDT-2 when expressed individually do not greatly impact cellobiose induction of cellulase gene expression. These data suggest that the N. crassa cellodextrin transporters act as ""transceptors"" with dual functions - cellodextrin transport and receptor signaling that results in downstream activation of cellulolytic gene expression. Similar mechanisms of transceptor activity likely occur in related ascomycetes used for industrial cellulase production."
https://openalex.org/W1996467959,"Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) are a morphologically distinct subgroup of human tumor cells with increased nuclear size or multiple nuclei, but they are generally considered unimportant because they are presumed to be nondividing and thus nonviable. We have recently shown that these large cancer cells are not only viable but also can divide asymmetrically and yield progeny cancer cells with cancer stem-like properties via budding division. To further understand the molecular events involved in the regulation of PGCCs and the generation of their progeny cancer cells, we comparatively analyzed the proteomic profiles of PGCCs, PGCCs with budding daughter cells, and regular control cancer cells from the HEY and SKOv3 human ovarian cancer cell lines with and without CoCl2. We used a high-throughput iTRAQ-based proteomic methodology coupled with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectroscopy to determine the differentiated regulated proteins. We performed Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses to validate the differences in the expression patterns of a variety of proteins between PGCCs or budding PGCCs and regular cancer cells identified by iTRAQ approach and also a selected group of proteins from the literature. The differentially regulated proteins included proteins involved in response to hypoxia, stem cell generation, chromatin remodeling, cell-cycle regulation, and invasion and metastasis. In particular, we found that HIF-1alpha and its known target STC1 are upregulated in PGCCs. In addition, we found that a panel of stem cell-regulating factors and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition regulatory transcription factors were upregulated in budding PGCCs, whereas expression of the histone 1 family of nucleosomal linker proteins was consistently lower in PGCCs than in control cells. Thus, proteomic expression patterns provide valuable insight into the underlying mechanisms of PGCC formation and the relationship between PGCCs and cancer stem cells in patients with ovarian cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2044160504,"FtsZ is a prokaryotic homolog of tubulin and is a key molecule in bacterial cell division. FtsZ with bound GTP polymerizes into tubulin-like protofilaments. Upon polymerization, the T7 loop of one subunit is inserted into the nucleotide-binding pocket of the second subunit, which results in GTP hydrolysis. Thus, the T7 loop is important for both polymerization and hydrolysis in the tubulin/FtsZ family. Although x-ray crystallography revealed both straight and curved conformations of tubulin, only a curved structure was known for FtsZ. Recently, however, FtsZ from Staphylococcus aureus has been shown to have a very different conformation from the canonical FtsZ structure. The present study was performed to investigate the structure of FtsZ from Staphylococcus aureus by mutagenesis experiments; the effects of amino acid changes in the T7 loop on the structure as well as on GTPase activity were studied. These analyses indicated that FtsZ changes its conformation suitable for polymerization and GTP hydrolysis by movement between N- and C-subdomains via intermolecular interactions between bound nucleotide and residues in the T7 loop."

TGF-β is a pathogenic mediator of all four of these diseases, prompting us to explore glucocorticoid/TGF-β signaling cross-talk. Glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, budesonide, and fluticasone, potentiated TGF-β signaling by the Acvrl1/Smad1/5/8 signaling axis and blunted signaling by the Tgfbr1/Smad2/3 axis in NIH/3T3 cells, as well as primary lung fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. Dexamethasone drove expression of the accessory type III TGF-β receptor Tgfbr3, also called betaglycan. Tgfbr3 was demonstrated to be a ""switch"" that blunted Tgfbr1/Smad2/3 and potentiated Acvrl1/Smad1 signaling in lung fibroblasts. The Acvrl1/Smad1 axis, which was stimulated by dexamethasone, was active in lung fibroblasts and antagonized Tgfbr1/Smad2/3 signaling. Dexamethasone acted synergistically with TGF-β to drive differentiation of primary lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, revealed by acquisition of smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin, which are exclusively Smad1-dependent processes in fibroblasts. Administration of dexamethasone to live mice recapitulated these observations and revealed a lung-specific impact of dexamethasone on lung Tgfbr3 expression and phospho-Smad1 levels in vivo. These data point to an interesting and hitherto unknown impact of glucocorticoids on TGF-β signaling in lung fibroblasts and other constituent cell types of the lung that may be relevant to lung physiology, as well as lung pathophysiology, in terms of drug/disease interactions."

Arg-453 is found in a conserved surface loop of the upper 50-kDa domain of the myosin motor domain and lies between the nucleotide binding pocket and the actin binding site. It connects to the cardiomyopathy loop via a long α-helix, helix O, and to Switch-2 via the fifth strand of the central β-sheet. The mutation is, therefore, in a position to perturb a wide range of myosin molecular activities.

Molecular basis of hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy.Tex. Heart Inst. J. 1994; 21: 6-15PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the frequency of the mutations and the disease, understanding how the mutation results in the disease remains poorly defined. There are many reasons for this, one being that the disease is often not manifest at birth but develops in the adolescent or adult, thus, separating the trigger of the disease development from the long term secondary and tertiary consequences of adaptation remains difficult. In addition, a major problem in defining the functional effect of the mutation in myosin is that patient material to test hypotheses is very limited. Mutations in myosin must alter its properties if it triggers disease development, yet in vitro studies of mutated human cardiac myosin from patients have been contradictory (8.Moore J.R. Leinwand L. Warshaw D.M. Understanding cardiomyopathy phenotypes based on the functional impact of mutations in the myosin motor.Circ. Res. 2012; 111: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This was due to the lack of a human recombinant expression system. Because of this, studies of myopathy mutations in myosin have used transgenic mouse cardiac models or non-cardiac myosins (9.Lowey S. Lesko L.M. Rovner A.S. Hodges A.R. White S.L. Low R.B. Rincon M.

This study demonstrated that the human β myosin motor domain, as expected, had properties similar to β-myosin isolated from the rabbit, rat, and cow and that the α-isoform was quite distinct from the β-isoform. The α-isoform, despite 91% sequence identity to the β-isoform in the motor domain, had properties similar to those of the fast skeletal muscle isoforms. More than 300 mutations in the motor domain of β-myosin have been reported to be linked to human cardiomyopathies (6.Buvoli M. Hamady M. Leinwand L.A. Knight R. Bioinformatics assessment of β-myosin mutations reveals myosin's high sensitivity to mutations.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2008; 18: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mutations occur throughout the motor domain, the rod domain, and in the light chains. Understanding how such a wide variety of different mutations can result in similar disease phenotypes remains a problem of current interest. One hypothesis suggests that mutations that enhance myosin motor activity lead to HCM, whereas mutations that decrease motor activity result in dilated cardiomyopathy (17.Debold E.P. Schmitt J.P.

The position of the linker is shown in Fig. 1. This loop lies between two highly conserved structural elements. At the C-terminal side it is connected to switch-2 (SW2) of the nucleotide binding pocket via the fifth strand of the central β-sheet. At the N-terminal side it connects to the cardiomyopathy loop of the actin binding site via a long α-helix (helix O). The surface linker is, therefore, in a position to sense signals from both actin and nucleotide binding sites and affect the communication between these sites. The β-sheet strand (β5) and helix O are both highly conserved across the broad myosin family, whereas the HO-linker shows more variability between myosin classes. The HO-linker is identical among sarcomeric mammalian/vertebrate myosins II, but it differs in smooth and non-muscle myosin II (see supplemental Fig. S1). The HO-linker, therefore, appears to be specific for sarcomeric myosins, and the R453C mutation could lead to wide-ranging effects on the motor properties of the myosin heavy chain. In some myosin classes (e.g. myosin V and some myosin Is) there is a small insert between the β-sheet and the HO-linker. Of interest is the presence of a mutation (T380M) in this same linker in human mammalian myosin 1c associated with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (22.Zadro C. Alemanno M.S. Bellacchio E. Ficarella R. Donaudy F. Melchionda S. Zelante L. Rabionet R. Hilgert N. Estivill X. Are MYO1C and MYO1F associated with hearing loss?.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the T380M mutation is associated with wide-ranging changes in the binding and release of nucleotide by the acto·myo1C (23.Adamek N. Geeves M.A. Coluccio L.M. Myo1c mutations associated with hearing loss cause defects in the interaction with nucleotide and actin.Cell. Mol. Life Sc. 2011; 68: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In closely related work, the effect of R453C mutation on the human β-myosin heavy chain was shown to reduce the actin-activated ATPase (by 20–30%) and inhibit in vitro motility (by 20–25%), whereas the single molecule step size was unchanged, and the intrinsic force was increased by 50% (24.Sommese R.F. Sung J. Nag S. Sutton S. Deacon J.C. Choe E. Leinwand L.A. Ruppel K. Spudich J.A.

We now report here a detailed evaluation of the nucleotide and actin binding properties of the R453C mutation in β-myosin S1 using stopped-flow. In contrast to the steady state and mechanical properties reported by Sommese et al. (24.Sommese R.F. Sung J. Nag S. Sutton S. Deacon J.C. Choe E. Leinwand L.A. Ruppel K. Spudich J.A. Molecular consequences of the R453C hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation on human β-cardiac myosin motor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), under unloaded conditions we find small effects of the mutation on myosin heavy chain in our transient kinetic assays. Only the SW2 closure/ATP-hydrolysis step appears slower by at least 60% for the mutant compared with the ATP hydrolysis measured for WT. The implications of this change in the hydrolysis step for the myosin in the working heart are discussed along with structural models of the role of the Arg-453 residue in the WT myosin. Human β-S1R453C was expressed and purified as described recently for human β-S1 wild-type (WT) (16.Deacon J.C. Bloemink M.J. Rezavandi H. Geeves M.A. Leinwand L.A. Erratum to: Identification of functional differences between recombinant human α and β cardiac myosin motors.Cell. Mol. Life Sc. 2012; 69: 4239-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The R453C mutation was introduced into the shortβ-S1 sequence (Met-1–Arg-808) by QuikChange inverse PCR (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) using overlapping PCR primers containing a mismatch to produce the mutation. The presence of the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. The mutation-bearing protein was co-expressed with the human ventricular essential light chain (MLC3) and when purified by this method was bound to MYL3 protein at a 1:1 ratio. This purified complex is referred to herein as β-S1R453C. Preparations of β-S1R453Cprotein assessed by SDS-PAGE were similar to those of β-sS1 from Deacon et al. (16.Deacon J.C. Bloemink M.J.

Measurements were performed with a High-Tech Scientific SF-61 DX2 stopped-flow system. Pyrene-actin fluorescence was excited at 365 nm, and emission was detected after passing through a KV389 nm cut-off filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany). Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm and observed through a WG320 filter. The stated concentrations of reactants are those after mixing in the stopped-flow observation cell unless otherwise specified. Stopped-flow data were analyzed using the Kinetic Studio software provided by TgK Scientific as well as with Origin (Microcal). Without actin present, the kinetics of S1 with ATP (T) or ADP (D) were interpreted based on the seven-step model described by Bagshaw et al. (27.Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S.

In Scheme 2, actin·S1 exists in two conformations (A·M and A·M′) in equilibrium. A·M′ is unable to bind nucleotide and must isomerize to A·M before ATP can bind. A similar pair of conformations exist in the presence of bound ADP, where A·M′·D must isomerize to A·M·D before ADP can dissociate. Pyrene-actin fluorescence is quenched in the pyrene·actin·S1 complex. Therefore, an increase in fluorescence intensity can be observed as a result of pyrene-actin dissociation from S1. The dissociation reaction can be induced by the addition of ATP to the pyrene·actin·S1 complex and resulting fluorescence transients analyzed to define the kinetics of the reaction. In the absence of ADP, high ATP concentrations induce the dissociation of actin from S1 in two phases. The fast phase represents dissociation from A·M according to Equation 1,kobs,fast=K′k′1[ATP]+2/(1+K′[ATP]1)(Eq. 1) SCHEME 2The interaction of S1 with actin, ATP, and ADP. T and D represent ATP and ADP, and actin·S1 exists in two conformations, A·M and A·M′, in equilibrium. A·M′ is unable to bind nucleotide and must isomerize to A·M before ATP can bind. A similar pair of conformations exist in the presence of bound ADP, where A·M′·D must isomerize to A·M·D before ADP can dissociate. Cross-bridge detachment from the rigor state (A·M) involves the complex binding ATP, governed by the association constant, K′1, followed by the rate-limiting isomerization, k′+2, after which actin-myosin affinity becomes weak, and the complex separates rapidly (28.Siemankowski R.F.

The ratio of the amplitudes of the fast and the slow phase of the ATP-induced dissociation defines the equilibrium constant between the two conformations in solution, and because Kα = k+α/k−α, k−α can be determined using Equation 2,Afast/Aslow=[A⋅M′]/[A⋅M]=Kα(Eq. 2) For fast myosin S1, such as skS1 and psoS1, Kα ≫ 1, and only a single phase is observed. In the presence of ADP, the overall dissociation constant of ADP for the actin·S1 complex (KAD) is defined by Equation 3,KAD=KADP⋅KαD/(1+KαD)(Eq. 3) where KADP is the dissociation constant for ADP from A·M and KαD is the equilibrium constant between A·M′·D and A·M·D. If the binding of ADP is a rapid equilibrium event, controlled by KADP, ADP and ATP compete effectively for binding to A·M, and the observed rate constant kobs is defined by Equation 4,kobs=K′k′1[ATP]+2/1+[ADP]/KAD(Eq. 4) The equation was used to analyze the data for ATP-induced dissociation of actin from the complex in the presence of ADP (see Fig. 4). For the data shown in Fig. 5 the analysis of the titration of S1 binding to actin was performed as described by Kurzawa and Geeves (31.Kurzawa S.E.

The amplitude of the observed transient is assumed to be proportional to the concentration of actin·S1 complex present before the addition of ATP. The data were fitted to the physically significant root of the following quadratic equation.α=[M]+KD+[A]0−([M]+KD+[A]0)2−4[M][A]02[A]0(Eq. 5) For this equation, α is the fraction of actin with S1 bound, [M] is the total concentration of S1 added, [A]0 is the concentration of actin, and KD is the dissociation constant of S1 for actin in the presence of absence of ADP (i.e. KA or KDA). In all cases the data in the figures refer to individual experimental measurements, whereas Table 1 gives the mean values of the fitted constant for two to three separate measurements using different protein preparations.TABLE 1Summary of transient kinetic parameters measured for WT and β-S1R453CMeasured parameterHC β-S1aData are from Deacon et al.

Scallop structures were chosen because scallop is the only sarcomeric myosin crystallized in various conformational states of myosin during the cross-bridge cycle: the rigor, detached, post-rigor, and the ADP-bound near-rigor state and the pre-power stroke state (see Table 2).TABLE 2Contacts between the side chain of Arg-453 and other residues close to the HO-linker for the various scallop structures and in homology models of human β-cardiac myosin Open table in a new tab ATP binding to the β-myosin motor domain can be followed using the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The highly conserved tryptophan on the end of the relay helix-loop provided the primary signal, and this is coupled to the rotation of the converter domain lever arm as part of the recovery stroke. The fluorescence change observed upon mixing 0.2 μm S1 with 250 μm ATP is illustrated in Fig. 2A. The signal has 2 phases: a large fast phase with amplitude of 17% and kobs = 69 s−1 and a small slow phase, amplitude= 1% kobs = 1.3 s−1. The observed amplitudes were independent of ATP concentration, whereas dependence of the kobs values on ATP concentration are shown in Fig. 2B. The fast phase showed an approximate hyperbolic dependence on ATP concentration with kmax of 88 s−1, the ATP concentration required for kmax/2 = K0.5 = 93 μm and initial slope of 1.08 m−1s−1. By analogy to our measurements of β-S1, these were assigned as: kmax = k+2, the initial slope = K1k+2, and K0.5 = 1/K1 (Scheme 1). The slow phase is difficult to measure at low ATP concentrations but above 50 μm is independent of ATP concentration. Again, by analogy with the wild-type data, this was assigned to k+3 + k−3, the rate constant of the ATP hydrolysis step, which is coupled with the recovery stroke. A summary of the data is shown in Table 1. For β-S1R453C k+2 is reduced by ∼40% with respect to wild type. In these measurements the small variable amplitudes of the slow phase make it hard to measure with precision, but for β-S1R453C it was consistent at, k+3 + k−3 ≤ 4 s−1. ATP binding to actin·S1 results in rapid dissociation of actin from the complex as defined by Scheme 2. Fig. 3A shows the pyrene-actin fluorescence resulting from the rapid mixing of 50 nm actin·S1 with 250 μm ATP. A biphasic transient was observed with a large amplitude fast phase (29%, kobs = 265 s−1) and a small (4.7%,"

In the present study, molecular biological methods, along with functional and histological studies, were performed. We found that sublytic C5b-9 (here, <5% lactate dehydrogenase release from cells is regarded as a sublytic effect) could induce the production of IL-6 and TGF-β1 through upregulation of p300 and C/EBPβ expression in GMCs, which might contribute to renal Th17/IL-17 production in Thy-1N rats. In addition, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ)-enhanced IL-6 and TGF-β1 promoter activity and p300-mediated C/EBPβ acetylation were involved in upregulation of IL-6 and TGF-β1 expression in GMCs attacked by sublytic C5b-9. In detail, the elements of C/EBPβ binding to rat IL-6 and TGF-β1 promoter and 3 acetylated sites of rat C/EBPβ protein were first revealed. Furthermore, silencing the p300 or C/EBPβ gene in rat kidney significantly reduced the production of IL-6 and TGF-β1 and renal lesions in Thy-1N rats. Together, these data indicate that the mechanism of IL-6 and TGF-β1 production in renal tissue of Thy-1N rats is associated with sublytic C5b-9 upregulated p300 and p300-mediated C/EBPβ acetylation as well as C/EBPβ-activated IL-6 and TGF-β1 genes.—Zhang, J., Li, Y., Shan, K., Wang, L., Qiu, W., Lu, Y., Zhao, D., Zhu, G., He, F., Wang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W1966736466,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal lung disease characterized by the overgrowth, hardening, and scarring of lung tissue. The exact mechanisms of how IPF develops and progresses are unknown. IPF is characterized by extracellular matrix remodeling and accumulation of active TGFβ, which promotes collagen expression and the differentiation of smooth muscle α-actin (SMA)-positive myofibroblasts. Aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) is an extracellular matrix protein secreted by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and is expressed in fibrotic human lung tissue and in mice with bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Importantly, ACLP knockout mice are significantly protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. The goal of this study was to identify the mechanisms of ACLP action on fibroblast differentiation. As primary lung fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts, ACLP expression preceded SMA and collagen expression. Recombinant ACLP induced SMA and collagen expression in mouse and human lung fibroblasts. Knockdown of ACLP slowed the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and partially reverted differentiated myofibroblasts by reducing SMA expression. We hypothesized that ACLP stimulates myofibroblast formation partly through activating TGFβ signaling. Treatment of fibroblasts with recombinant ACLP induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3. This phosphorylation and induction of SMA was dependent on TGFβ receptor binding and kinase activity. ACLP-induced collagen expression was independent of interaction with the TGFβ receptor. These findings indicate that ACLP stimulates the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition by promoting SMA expression via TGFβ signaling and promoting collagen expression through a TGFβ receptor-independent pathway."

In this study, we show that the expression of TEAD1 is significantly induced during smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation and negatively correlates with smooth muscle-specific gene expression. We further demonstrate that TEAD1 plays a novel role in suppressing expression of smooth muscle-specific genes, including smooth muscle α-actin, by abolishing the promyogenic function of myocardin, a key mediator of smooth muscle differentiation. Mechanistically, we found that TEAD1 competes with myocardin for binding to serum response factor (SRF), resulting in disruption of myocardin and SRF interactions and thereby attenuating expression of smooth muscle-specific genes.

Ubiquitin modification allows recognition and association of cargo with endosomally associated protein complexes, enabling sorting of proteins to be degraded from those to be recycled. The mechanism that provides coordination between the cellular machineries that mediate ubiquitination and endosomal sorting is unknown. We report that the ubiquitin ligase UBE4B is recruited to endosomes in response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation by binding to Hrs, a key component of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) 0. We identify the EGFR as a substrate for UBE4B, establish UBE4B as a regulator of EGFR degradation, and describe a mechanism by which UBE4B regulates endosomal sorting, affecting cellular levels of the EGFR and its downstream signaling. We propose a model in which the coordinated action of UBE4B, ESCRT-0, and the deubiquitinating enzyme USP8 enable the endosomal sorting and lysosomal degradation of the EGFR."

The FAK protein level gradually decreased, whereas its mRNA level was constant during myogenesis in C2C12 cells and MyoD-overexpressing mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The FAK protein was associated with the E2 enzyme UBE2H and the E3 enzyme MG53 in endogenous and exogenous immunoprecipitation experiments. FAK ubiquitination and degradation was induced by MG53 overexpression in myoblasts but abolished by MG53 or UBE2H knockdown in myotubes. Because RING-disrupted MG53 mutants (C14A and ΔR) did not induce FAK ubiquitination and degradation, the RING domain was determined to be required for MG53-induced FAK ubiquitination. Taken together, these data indicate that MG53 induces FAK ubiquitination with the aid of UBE2H during skeletal myogenesis."

Spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release and CaWs were induced in the presence of high (4 mM) external Ca2+ (Cao2+). The protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) reversibly raised basal Cai2+ levels even after depletion of SR Ca2+ in the absence of Cao2+ , suggesting Ca2+ release from mitochondria. FCCP at 0.01 - 0.1 µM partially depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and increased the frequency and amplitude of CaWs in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneous recording of cell membrane potentials showed the augmentation of delayed afterdepolarization amplitudes and frequencies, and induction of triggered action potentials. The effect of FCCP on CaWs was mimicked by antimycin A (an electron transport chain inhibitor disrupting Δψm) or Ru360 (a mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor), but not by oligomycin (an ATP synthase inhibitor) or iodoacetic acid (a glycolytic inhibitor), excluding the contribution of intracellular ATP levels. The effects of FCCP on CaWs were counteracted by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore blocker cyclosporine A, or the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter activator kaempferol. Our results suggest that mitochondrial Ca2+ release and uptake exquisitely control the local Ca2+ level in the micro-domain near SR ryanodine receptors and play an important role in regulation of intracellular CaWs and arrhythmogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2119087004,"Carbon ion irradiation is an emerging therapeutic option for various tumor entities. Radiation resistance of solid tumors toward photon irradiation is caused by attenuation of DNA damage in less oxygenated tumor areas and by increased hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling. Carbon ion irradiation acts independently of oxygen;however, the role of HIF-1 is unclear. We analyzed the effect of HIF-1 signaling after carbon ions in comparison to photons by using biological equivalent radiation doses in a human non-small-cell cancer model. The studies were performed in cultured A549 and H1299 cell lines and in A549 xenografts. Knockdown of HIF-1α in vivo combined with photon irradiation delayed tumor growth (23 vs. 13 d; P<0.05). Photon irradiation induced HIF-1α and target genes, predominantly in oxygenated cells (1.6-fold; P<0.05), with subsequent enhanced tumor angiogenesis (1.7-fold; P<0.05). These effects were not observed after carbon ion irradiation. Micro-DNA array analysis indicated that photons, but not carbon ions, significantly induced components of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway (gene set enrichment analysis; P<0.01) as relevant for HIF-1α induction. After carbon ion irradiation in vivo, we observed substantially decreased HIF-1α levels (8.9-fold; P<0.01) and drastically delayed tumor growth (P<0.01), an important finding that indicates a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) than anticipated from the cell survival data. Taken together, the evidence showed that carbon ions mediate an improved therapeutic effectiveness without tumor-promoting HIF-1 signaling.—Subtil, F. S.

https://openalex.org/W2071002568,"The tumor suppressor PTEN plays a critical role in the regulation of multiple cellular processes that include survival, cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. PTEN is frequently mutated or deleted in various human cancer cells to promote tumorigenesis. PTEN is regulated by SUMOylation, but the SUMO E3 ligase involved in the SUMOylation of PTEN remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that PIASxα is a SUMO E3 ligase for PTEN. PIASxα physically interacted with PTEN both in vitro and in vivo. Their interaction depended on the integrity of phosphatase and C2 domains of PTEN and the region of PIASxα comprising residues 134-347. PIASxα enhanced PTEN protein stability by reducing PTEN ubiquitination, whereas the mutation of PTEN SUMO1 conjugation sites neutralized the effect of PIASxα on PTEN protein half-life. Functionally, PIASxα, as a potential tumor suppressor, negatively regulated the PI3K-Akt pathway through stabilizing PTEN protein. Overexpression of PIASxα led to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, thus triggering cell proliferation inhibition and tumor suppression, whereas PIASxα knockdown or deficiency in catalytic activity abolished the inhibition. Together our studies suggest that PIASxα is a novel SUMO E3 ligase for PTEN, and it positively regulates PTEN protein level in tumor suppression."

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the function of Ten-4 in neurite outgrowth. Ten-4 expression was induced during neurite outgrowth of the neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2a. Ten-4 protein was localized at the neurite growth cones. Knockdown of Ten-4 expression in Neuro-2a cells decreased the formation of the filopodia-like protrusions and the length of individual neurites. Conversely, overexpression of Ten-4 promoted filopodia-like protrusion formation. In addition, knockdown and overexpression of Ten-4 reduced and elevated the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rho-family small GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, key molecules for the membranous protrusion formation downstream of FAK, respectively. Inhibition of the activation of FAK and neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), which is a downstream regulator of FAK and Cdc42, blocked protrusion formation by Ten-4 overexpression. Further, Ten-4 colocalized with phosphorylated FAK in the filopodia-like protrusion regions. Together, our findings show that Ten-4 is a novel positive regulator of cellular protrusion formation and neurite outgrowth through the FAK signaling pathway.—Suzuki, N., Numakawa, T., Chou, J., de Vega, S., Mizuniwa, C., Sekimoto, K., Adachi, N., Kunugi, H., Arikawa-Hirasawa, E., Yamada, Y., Akazawa, C.

https://openalex.org/W2054013802,"Chemotherapy induces apoptosis and tumor regression primarily through activation of p53-mediated transcription. Neuroblastoma is a p53 wild type malignancy at diagnosis and repression of p53 signaling plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Recently developed small molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction are able to overcome this repression and potently activate p53 dependent apoptosis in malignancies with intact p53 downstream signaling. We used the small molecule MDM2 inhibitor, Nutlin-3a, to determine the p53 drug response signature in neuroblastoma cells. In addition to p53 mediated apoptotic signatures, GSEA and pathway analysis identified a set of p53-repressed genes that were reciprocally over-expressed in neuroblastoma patients with the worst overall outcome in multiple clinical cohorts. Multifactorial regression analysis identified a subset of four genes (CHAF1A, RRM2, MCM3, and MCM6) whose expression together strongly predicted overall and event-free survival (p<0.0001). The expression of these four genes was then validated by quantitative PCR in a large independent clinical cohort. Our findings further support the concept that oncogene-driven transcriptional networks opposing p53 activation are essential for the aggressive behavior and poor response to therapy of high-risk neuroblastoma."

We report on the feasibility of the use 5-ALA fluorescence guidance, the extent of resection (EOR) rates and complications of early re-do surgery.Nine of 151 patients (6%) with glioblastoma resections had an unintentional tumor remnant with a volume >0.175 cm(3). 5-ALA guided re-do surgery completed the resection (CRET) in all patients without causing neurological deficits, infections or other complications. Patients who underwent a re-do surgery remained hospitalized between surgeries, resulting in a mean length of hospital stay of 11 days (range 7-15), compared to 9 days for single surgery (range 3-23; p=0.147).Our early re-do protocol led to complete resection of all enhancing tumor in all cases without any new neurological deficits and thus provides a similar oncological result as intraoperative MRI (iMRI). The repeated use of 5-ALA induced fluorescence, used for identification of small remnants, remains highly sensitive and specific in the setting of re-do surgery.

However, the effect of C/EBPβ on proliferative chondrocytes is unclear. Here, we investigated whether C/EBPβ represses type II collagen (COL2A1) expression and is involved in the regulation of sex-determining region Y-type high mobility group box 9 (SOX9), a crucial factor for transactivation of Col2a1. Endogenous expression of C/EBPβ in the embryonic growth plate and differentiated ATDC5 cells were opposite to those of COL2A1 and SOX9. Overexpression of C/EBPβ by adenovirus vector in ATDC5 cells caused marked repression of Col2a1. The expression of Sox9 mRNA and nuclear protein was also repressed, resulting in decreased binding of SOX9 to the Col2a1 enhancer as shown by a ChIP assay. Knockdown of C/EBPβ by lentivirus expressing shRNA caused significant stimulation of these genes in ATDC5 cells. Reporter assays demonstrated that C/EBPβ repressed transcriptional activity of Col2a1.

https://openalex.org/W1976097554,"Huntington disease is associated with early alterations in corticostriatal synaptic function that precede cell death, and it is postulated that ameliorating such changes may delay clinical onset and/or prevent neurodegeneration. Although many of these synaptic alterations are thought to be attributable to a toxic gain of function of the mutant huntingtin protein, the role that nonpathogenic huntingtin (HTT) plays in synaptic function is relatively unexplored. Here, we compare the immunocytochemical localization of a major postsynaptic scaffolding protein, PSD-95, in striatal neurons from WT mice and mice overexpressing HTT with 18 glutamine repeats (YAC18, nonpathogenic). We found that HTT overexpression resulted in a palmitoylation- and BDNF-dependent increase in PSD-95 clustering at synaptic sites in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) co-cultured with cortical neurons. Surprisingly, the latter effect was mediated presynaptically, as HTT overexpression in cortical neurons alone was sufficient to increase PSD-95 clustering in the postsynaptic SPNs. In contrast, antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of HTT in WT co-cultures resulted in a significant reduction of PSD-95 clustering in SPNs. Notably, despite these bidirectional changes in PSD-95 clustering, we did not observe an alteration in basal electrophysiological measures of AMPA and NMDA receptors. Thus, unlike in previous studies in the hippocampus, enhanced or decreased PSD-95 clustering alone was insufficient to drive AMPA or NMDA receptors into or out of SPN synapses. In all, our results demonstrate that nonpathogenic HTT can indeed influence synaptic protein localization and uncover a novel role of HTT in PSD-95 distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1990790189,"The reelin signaling protein and its downstream components have been associated with synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. The reelin signaling pathway begins with the binding of reelin to the transmembrane lipoprotein receptor apolipopro-tein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), which in turns induces the sequential cleavage of ApoER2 by the sequential action of α- and γ-secretases. Using conditional-knockout mice of the catalytic component of the γ-secretase complex, presenilin 1 (PS1), we demonstrated increased brain ApoER2 and reelin protein and transcript levels, with no changes in the number of reelin-positive cells. Using the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, we showed that ApoER2 processing occurs in the presence of PS1, producing an intracellular ApoER2 C-terminal fragment. In addition, the pharmacologic inhibition of γ-secretase in SH-SY5Y cells led to increased reelin levels. Overexpression of ApoER2 decreased reelin mRNA levels in these cells. A luciferase reporter gene assay and nuclear fractionation confirmed that increased amounts of intracellular fragment of ApoER2 suppressed reelin expression at a transcriptional level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments corroborated that the intracellular fragment of ApoER2 bound to the RELN promoter region. Our study suggests that PS1/γ-secretase-dependent processing of the reelin receptor ApoER2 inhibits reelin expression and may regulate its signaling.—Balmaceda, V., Cuchillo-Ibáñez, I., Pujadas, L., García-Ayllón, M.-S., Saura, C.

https://openalex.org/W1979306267,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is associated with aging, and it leads to neuron death. Deposits of amyloid β and aberrantly phosphorylated tau protein are known as pathological hallmarks of AD, but the underlying mechanisms have not yet been revealed. A high-throughput gene expression analysis previously showed that differentially expressed genes accompanying the progression of AD were more down-regulated than up-regulated in the later stages of AD. This suggested that the molecular networks and their constituent modules collapsed along with AD progression. In this study, by using gene expression profiles and protein interaction networks (PINs), we identified the PINs expressed in three brain regions: the entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus (HIP) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Dividing the expressed PINs into modules, we examined the stability of the modules with AD progression and with normal aging. We found that in the AD modules, the constituent proteins, interactions and cellular functions were not maintained between consecutive stages through all brain regions. Interestingly, the modules were collapsed with AD progression, specifically in the EC region. By identifying the modules that were affected by AD pathology, we found the transcriptional regulation-associated modules that interact with the proteasome-associated module via UCHL5 hub protein, which is a deubiquitinating enzyme. Considering PINs as a system made of network modules, we found that the modules relevant to the transcriptional regulation are disrupted in the EC region, which affects the ubiquitin-proteasome system."
https://openalex.org/W2079543475,"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a severe thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by uncontrolled complement activation against endothelial and blood cells. Mutations in the C-terminal target recognition domains 19-20 of complement regulator factor H (FH) are strongly associated with aHUS, but the mechanisms triggering disease onset have remained unresolved. Here we report that several aHUS-related mutations alter the binding of FH19-20 to proteins where lysines have reacted with malondialdehyde (MDA). Although FH19-20 did not interact with MDA-modified hexylamine, lysine-containing peptides, or a proteolytically degraded protein, it bound to MDA-modified polylysine. This suggests that FH19-20 recognizes only clustered MDA adducts. Binding of MDA-modified BSA to FH19-20 was ionic by nature, depended on positive residues of FH19-20, and competed with the polyanions heparin and DNA. This could not be explained with the mainly neutral adducts known to form in MDA modification. When positive charges of lysines were eliminated by acetic anhydride instead of MDA, the acetylated BSA started to bind FH19-20. Together, these results indicate that negative charges on the modified proteins dominate the interaction with FH19-20. This is beneficial for the physiological function of FH because by binding to the negative charges of the modified target, FH could prevent excess complement activation initiated by naturally occurring antibodies recognizing MDA epitopes with multiple different structures. We propose that oxidative stress leading to formation of MDA adducts is a common feature for triggers of aHUS and that failure of FH in protecting MDA-modified surfaces from complement activation is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease."

Methods BMSCs were isolated from rats and amplified with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF-4). The expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), cytokeratin 18 (CK-18), and albumin (ALB) was detected by immunofluorescence in induced cells. Rats were randomly divided into experimental (with common bile duct ligation) and control groups. After injection of fluorescence labeled cells, cell distribution was observed under a fluorescence microscope. The integrated optical density (IOD) and cell distribution scores were evaluated using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software. The portal pressure was measured before the rats were killed. Results After being induced with HGF and FGF-4, the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, and mitochondria all significantly increased in the fifth generation cells. Immunofluorescent analysis showed that the induced cells expressed AFP, CK-18, and ALB. BMSCs were stained by CM-Dil, and the labeling rate was as high as 95.5%. The portal pressure in experimental group was much higher than that of the control group (18.04±2.35 vs. 9.75±1.40cm H2O p<0.01). The IOD of transplanted cells in the experimental group was also significantly higher than that of the control group (11.30±2.09×105 vs. 2.93±0.88×105, p<0.01). In addition, the cell distribution score in the experimental group was lower than that of the control group (1.99±0.36 vs. 2.36±0.27, P<0.05). Conclusions The combination of HGF and FGF-4 induces the differentiation of BMSCs into hepatocyte-like cells, which express AFP, CK-18, and ALB. In addition, the recruitment of BMSCs (after transplantation in the spleen) was improved in rats with portal hypertension."

In our procedures, we used a combination of biochemical approaches, including quantitative PCR and Western blots, along with a histological analysis using standard and immunohistological measures. We found that 8-wk-old male affected pigs had a 70% reduction in dystrophin protein abundance in the diaphragm, psoas major, and longissimus lumborum and a 5-fold increase in serum creatine kinase activity compared with healthy male littermates. Dystrophin insufficiency in the diaphragm and the longissimus resulted in muscle histopathology with disorganized fibrosis that often colocalized with fatty infiltration but not the psoas. Affected animals also had an 80-85% reduction in α-sarcoglycan localization in these muscles, indicating compromised assembly of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex. Controls used in this study were 4 healthy male littermates, as they are most closely related to the affected animals. We concluded that pigs with insufficient dystrophin protein expression have a phenotype consistent with human dystrophinopathy patients. Given that and their similarity in body size and physiology to humans, we further conclude that this pig line is an appropriate translational model for dystrophinopathies."

We examined the optical chemistry of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in forty-five urban ponds across southern Ontario, Canada to examine whether optical characteristics in these relatively new ecosystems are distinct from other freshwater systems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged from 2 to 16 mg C L-1 across the ponds with an average value of 5.3 mg C L-1. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modelling showed urban pond DOM to be characterized by microbial-like and, less importantly, by terrestrial derived humic-like components. The relatively transparent, non-humic DOM in urban ponds was more similar to that found in open water, lake ecosystems than to rivers or wetlands. After irradiation equivalent to 1.7 days of natural solar radiation, DOC concentrations, on average, decreased by 38% and UV absorbance decreased by 25%. Irradiation decreased the relative abundances of terrestrial humic-like components and increased protein-like aspects of the DOM pool. These findings suggest that high internal production and/or prolonged exposure to sunlight exerts a distinct and significant influence on the chemistry of urban pond DOM, which likely reduces its chemical similarity with upstream sources. These properties of urban pond DOM may alter its biogeochemical role in these relatively novel aquatic ecosystems."

Pathogenic staphylococci express several different SD proteins that are modified by two glycosyltransferases, SdgA and SdgB. Here, we characterized three genes of S. aureus, aggA, aggB (sdgA), and aggC (sdgB), and show that aggA and aggC contribute to staphylococcal agglutination with fibrin fibrils in human plasma. We demonstrate that aggB (sdgA) and aggC (sdgB) are involved in GlcNAc modification of the ClfA SD repeats. However, only sdgB is essential for GlcNAc modification, and an sdgB mutant is defective in the pathogenesis of sepsis in mice.

We investigated residues in GPR35 responsible for ligand activation and the receptor structure in the active state. GPR35 contains numerous positively charged amino acids that face into the binding pocket that cluster in two distinct receptor regions, TMH3-4-5-6 and TMH1-2-7. Computer modeling implicated TMH3-4-5-6 for activation by the GPR35 agonists zaprinast and pamoic acid. Mutation results for the TMH1-2-7 region of GPR35 showed no change in ligand efficacies at the K1.32A, R2.65A, R7.33A, and K7.40A mutants. However, mutation of arginine residues in the TMH3-4-5-6 region (R4.60, R6.58, R3.36, R(164), and R(167) in the EC2 loop) had effects on signaling for one or both agonists tested. R4.60A resulted in a total ablation of agonist-induced activation in both the β-arrestin trafficking and ERK1/2 activation assays. R6.58A increased the potency of zaprinast 30-fold in the pERK assay. The R(167)A mutant decreased the potency of pamoic acid in the β-arrestin trafficking assay. The R(164)A and R(164)L mutants decreased potencies of both agonists. Similar trends for R6.58A and R(167)A were observed in calcium responses. Computer modeling showed that the R6.58A mutant has additional interactions with zaprinast. R3.36A did not express on the cell surface but was trapped in the cytoplasm. The lack of surface expression of R3.36A was rescued by a GPR35 antagonist, CID2745687.

Contrary to antiapoptotic rat and human v1, overexpression of rat v2 or human v4 (the human homologue of rat v2) in epithelial cells exacerbated cell death by 30% following H2O2 treatment compared with control vector. Coexpression of rat v1 and v2 or human v1 and v4 neutralized the protective effects of rat and human v1 and the proapoptotic effects of rat v2 and human v4 by modulating cytochrome c release. This is, at least partly, mediated by the ability of Hax-1 proteins to form homotypic and heterotypic dimers with binding affinities ranging from ∼3.8 nm for v1 dimers to ∼97 nm for v1/v2 dimers. The minimal binding region supporting these interactions lies between amino acids 97–278, which are shared by nearly all Hax-1 proteins, indicating that additional factors regulate the preferential formation of Hax-1 homo- or heterodimers. Our studies are the first to show that Hax-1 is a family of anti- and proapoptotic regulators that may modulate cell survival and death through homo- or heterodimerization. Studies on Hax-1 have mainly focused on variant (v) 1, demonstrating its antiapoptotic properties. However, HAX1 is heavily spliced, generating structurally distinct isoforms. We sought to characterize the Hax-1 isoforms expressed in rat heart before and after insult. We confirmed the presence of at least four Hax-1 transcripts in healthy rat cardiac muscle.

https://openalex.org/W2087756474,"DJ-1 is an oncogene and also causative gene for familial Parkinson's disease. DJ-1 has multiple functions, including transcriptional regulation. DJ-1 acts as a coactivator that binds to various transcription factors, resulting in stimulation or repression of the expression of their target genes. In this study, we found that the cholecystokinin (CCK) gene is a transcriptional target gene for DJ-1. CCK is a peptide hormone and plays roles in contraction of the gallbladder and in promotion of secretion of pancreatic fluid. CCK is co-localized with dopamine in the substantia nigra to regulate release of dopamine. Reduced expression of CCK mRNA was observed in DJ-1-knockdown cells. The Ras-responsive element (RRE) and Sp1 site were essential for promoter activity, and DJ-1 stimulated promoter activity by binding to RRE-binding protein 1 (RREBP1). The complex of DJ-1 with RREB1 but not with Sp1 bound to the RRE. Furthermore, the reduced CCK level in the serum from DJ-1-knockout mice compared to that from wild-type mice was observed. This is the first report showing that DJ-1 participates in peptide hormone synthesis."

Furthermore, we confirmed that the T stage-N stage-number of negative lymph nodes-metastasis (TNnM) classification is the most appropriate prognostic predictor of GC patients by using case-control matched fashion and multinominal logistic regression. Finally, we were able to clarify that TNnM classification may provide more precise survival differences among the different TNM sub-stages of GC by using the measure of agreement (Kappa coefficient), the McNemar value, the Akaike information criterion, and the Bayesian Information Criterion compared with the seventh edition of the TNM classification.The number of negative nodes, as an important prognostic predictor of GC, can improve the prognostic prediction efficiency of the seventh edition of the TNM classification for GC, which should be recommended for conventional clinical applications."

We present here a functional characterization of PcalRG, a novel reverse gyrase from the archaeon Pyrobaculum calidifontis. PcalRG is the most robust and processive reverse gyrase known to date; it is active over a wide range of conditions, including temperature, ionic strength, and ATP concentration. Moreover, it holds a strong ATP-inhibited DNA cleavage activity. Most important, PcalRG is able to induce ATP-dependent unwinding of synthetic Holliday junctions and ATP-stimulated annealing of unconstrained single-stranded oligonucleotides. Combined DNA unwinding and annealing activities are typical of certain helicases, but until now were shown for no other reverse gyrase.

RG is a modular enzyme, as it comprises a C-terminal type IA topoisomerase domain and an N-terminal region containing sequence motifs typical of the SF2 helicase family, including an ATP-binding domain. For its intriguing features, RG has attracted considerable interest over the last few years, and several members of this family have been characterized with the aim of elucidating its mechanism, which is still not completely understood. Despite considerable primary sequence similarity (see supplemental Fig. S1), different RGs show both structural and functional differences. For instance, although all RGs are thermophilic enzymes, their optimal reaction temperatures range between 75 and 90 °C. Whereas an NTP is absolutely required for the positive supercoiling reaction, some RGs are able to relax DNA in the absence of nucleotide, whereas others are not. Differences in processivity and ionic strength preference are also seen (11Rodriguez A.C. Studies of a positive supercoiling machine.

The isolated C- and N-terminal domains of a few RGs can exist in stable form either naturally (e.g. the Nanoarchaeum equitans enzyme) or as a result of a deletion mutagenesis (e.g. Sulfolobus RG), retaining their own activities and restoring the positive supercoiling activity when combined. In both enzymes, the C-terminal domain stimulates the N-terminal ATPase activity (13Valenti A. Perugino G. D'Amaro A. Cacace A. Napoli A. Rossi M. Ciaramella M.

In contrast, in Thermotoga maritima RG, each domain was suggested to attenuate the individual activities of the other, although only the N-terminal domain of this enzyme was tested in isolation (20del Toro Duany Y.

Phys. 2011; 13: 10009-10019Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It was previously proposed that communication between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains is mediated by the so-called latch, a poorly conserved region of the N-terminal domain. Deletion of this region has different effects in different RGs: for example, in the Archaeoglobus fulgidus enzyme, the latch suppresses DNA relaxation in the absence of ATP, but is not essential for positive supercoiling (11Rodriguez A.C. Studies of a positive supercoiling machine. Nucleotide hydrolysis and a multifunctional “latch” in the mechanism of reverse gyrase.J. Biol.

Investigating the role of the latch in the positive supercoiling mechanism of reverse gyrase.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5993-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); in the Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis RG the latch is required for positive DNA supercoiling, but not for DNA binding (17Li J. Liu J. Zhou J. Xiang H. Functional evaluation of four putative DNA-binding regions in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis reverse gyrase.Extremophiles. 2011; 15: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); finally, in the T. maritima enzyme it contributes to DNA binding and is required for positive supercoiling and ATP-dependent transient duplex separation (23Ganguly A. Del Toro Duany Y. Rudolph M.G. Klostermeier D. The latch modulates nucleotide and DNA binding to the helicase-like domain of Thermotoga maritima reverse gyrase and is required for positive DNA supercoiling.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Ganguly A. del Toro Duany Y. Klostermeier D. Reverse gyrase transiently unwinds double-stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of these differences are currently not clear. Primary sequence alignments show regions highly conserved in all RGs, in particular in the topoisomerase domain, whereas considerable sequence and length variability is seen in the N-terminal domain (supplemental Fig. S1). The two RG three-dimensional structures available showed overall similarities, but significantly different folds in the N-terminal domain, in particular in the latch and the H1 sub-domain (25Rodríguez A.C. Stock D. Crystal structure of reverse gyrase: insights into the positive supercoiling of DNA.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Rudolph M.G. del Toro Duany Y.

Crystal structures of Thermotoga maritima reverse gyrase: inferences for the mechanism of positive DNA supercoiling.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, these structural data failed to provide straightforward explanation of the action mechanism as well as the functional differences among RGs. Here, we present a biochemical characterization of the RG from the crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum calidifontis (PcalRG), which appears even more peculiar as compared with other RGs, as it shows: (i) high thermal activity and salt tolerance of its positive DNA supercoiling activity; (ii) the ability of inducing unwinding of synthetic Holliday junctions (HJs); (iii) single strand (ss) DNA annealing; and (iv) strong ssDNA cleavage activity. ATP has an essential modulatory role, not only in positive supercoiling, but also in all these activities: it stimulates ssDNA annealing, inhibits DNA cleavage, and is required for HJ unwinding. These features make PcalRG distinct from all other RGs studied so far and reveal additional properties of this class of unconventional enzymes. The PcalRG gene (GenBankTM database accession number CP000561, gene identifier number GI: 126459306) was amplified from P. calidifontis genomic DNA using oligonucleotides matching the 5′- and the 3′-terminal ends of the coding sequence with the addition of an NdeI restriction site at the 5′-end (sequences available upon request). The amplified gene product was ligated to TA cloning vector pTZ57R/T (Thermo Scientific); the recombinant plasmid, named Rg-pTZ57, was digested with NdeI and HindIII to liberate the PcalRG gene, which was ligated to pET-21a(+) (Novagen) digested with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting recombinant expression vector was named Rg-pET. The presence of PcalRG gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing using CEQ800 Beckman Coulter sequencing system. Multiple sequence alignments were performed by using ClustalW (27Larkin M.A. Clustal W and Clustal X version 2.0.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22516) Google Scholar) and T-coffee (www.tcoffee.org) programs. Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells transformed with Rg-pET were grown in 3 liters of ZY autoinduction medium (28Studier F.W.

Autoinduction systems enable regulated protein expression in E. coli without the need to monitor the culture or add inducer during cell growth. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 3–4 h until the A600 reached 1.5–2.0 followed by further overnight incubation at 17 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, the cell pellet was suspended in Resuspension buffer (25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm Na2HPO4, 1.0 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and subjected to three cycles of freeze-thawing followed by enzymatic digestion with lysozyme (1 mg/g wet cells) at room temperature for 1 h on shaking after adding 0.25% Triton X-100, Benzonase (25 units/g of cells), and protease inhibitors (PMSF 1.0 mm, leupeptin 20 μm and aprotinin 0.8 μm). Partially broken lysate was immediately lysed using three cycles of French Press. Lysate was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was heated at 80 °C for 20 min and centrifuged again at 110,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C.

Appropriate controls were included in each experiment and, to minimize variations among different samples, a single mix with all common components was set up. After incubation, reactions were stopped by adding 2% SDS at room temperature and immediately loaded on 1.2% agarose gel run in the first dimension without intercalants and with ethidium bromide (0.01 μg/ml) in the second dimension. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml), analyzed under UV light using a VersaDoc 4000™ apparatus and quantified with QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad).

PcalRG was added to the mixture, and samples were incubated for 10 min at appropriate temperature chosen to minimize spontaneous annealing. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× Stop solution, samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis as described for the DNA unwinding assay, and reaction substrates and products were analyzed and quantified by gel imaging as described above. Samples were incubated in Activity Buffer (35 mm Tris-HCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0) with appropriate concentrations of ATP (10 μm to 2.0 mm), and the appropriate amount of enzyme (10–40 ng/μl) was added. For kinetic analysis, each reaction was divided into aliquots and incubated at 85 °C for different time spans. The nucleotide hydrolysis was measured spectrophotometrically using the Malachite Green Phosphate Assay Kit (BioAssay System, Hayward, CA) as described (13Valenti A. Perugino G. D'Amaro A. Cacace A.

Each value was corrected for the spontaneous hydrolysis of ATP under the same conditions; values were plotted against time to obtain the initial velocity, v0 (in nmol Pi/min). The GraphPad Prism 5™ software (version 5.01) was used to plot v0 values against ATP concentrations by fitting the following substrate inhibition equation: v = Vmax × [S]/(Km × [S] × (1 + [S]/Ki)), allowing the determination of the steady-state kinetic constants. v0 values at each substrate concentration were used to calculate the enzyme specific activities, expressed as units/mg, where one unit was the amount of enzyme able to hydrolyze 1.0 μmol of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate in 1 min under the conditions indicated.

Sequence comparison with bacterial and archaeal RGs shows all conserved motifs typical of the SF2 family helicases in the PcalRG N-terminal domain (including an ATP binding site), and overall high similarity in the C-terminal topoisomerase domain (supplemental Fig. S1). A single putative Zn finger, conserved in all RGs, is present at the N terminus (aa 11–20); the region corresponding to the latch is longer than in most of the other RGs (aa 432 to 536), as is the insert in the H1 domain (aa 242–290). We have cloned the PcalRG gene in a vector for heterologous expression in E. coli and purified the recombinant untagged protein. The protein preparation showed reproducibly, besides a ∼130 kDa band corresponding to the full-length protein, a ∼70 kDa protein band corresponding to a truncated product, as shown by its cross-reactivity with an antibody directed against the S. solfataricus TopR1 RG (10Valenti A.

Such truncated fragments were present in variable amounts in independent enzyme preparations, and accumulated with prolonged storage in parallel with reduction of all enzyme activities (data not shown). We thus believe that the active form is the full-length enzyme, corresponding to the high molecular weight band, whereas faster band(s) are due to a proteolytic process that leads to enzyme inactivation.

The topoisomerase activity of the purified recombinant PcalRG was analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, which allows separation of positive and negative plasmid topoisomers (Fig. 1A). Such assay allows qualitative and quantitative analysis of topoisomerase activity, taking into account both the amount of plasmid topological isomers (topoisomers) produced and their Linking number (ΔLk), and gives information not only on the efficiency, but also on the distributive or processive character of the reaction. PcalRG showed the hallmark of all RGs, i.e. ATP-dependent positive supercoiling of covalently closed DNA plasmids (Fig. 1B). This activity required the presence of ATP and high temperature: whereas at 50 °C the enzyme showed only a weak DNA relaxation activity, both the amount and ΔLk of positive topoisomers increased with temperature; in reactions above 90 °C all products were highly positive, and a significant activity was seen even at 100 °C (Fig. 1, B and C). At all temperatures, relaxed and/or positive topoisomers were produced when a certain amount of the negative substrate was still present, thus suggesting that the enzyme is highly processive, i.e. it performs multiple supercoiling cycles before detaching from DNA and attacking a new substrate molecule. Processivity greatly increased with temperature, and above 90 °C highly positive and highly negative topoisomers coexisted (Fig. 1B). Positive supercoiling efficiency increased with"

Evidence derives from both clinical and experimental observations where vision, which is of primary importance in kinesthesia, was systematically precluded. The purpose of the present experiment was to assess the role of volitional effort in kinesthesia when visual information is available. Participants (n=20) produced isometric contraction (10-20% of maximal voluntary force) of their right arm while their left arm, which image was reflected in a mirror, either was passively moved into flexion/extension by a motorized manipulandum, or remained static. The contraction of the right arm was either congruent with or opposite to the passive displacements of the left arm. Results revealed that in most trials, kinesthetic illusions were visually driven, and their occurrence and intensity were modulated by whether volitional effort was congruent or not with visual signals. These results confirm the impact of volitional effort in kinesthesia and demonstrate for the first time that these signals interact with visual afferents to offer a coherent and unified percept."
https://openalex.org/W2150626226,"As frequently reported, psychometric assessments on Picture Story Exercises, especially variations of the Thematic Apperception Test, mostly reveal inadequate scores for internal consistency. We demonstrate that the reason for this apparent shortcoming is not caused by the coding system itself but from the incorrect use of internal consistency coefficients, especially Cronbach's α. This problem could be eliminated by using the category-scores as items instead of the picture-scores. In addition to a theoretical explanation we prove mathematically why the use of category-scores produces an adequate internal consistency estimation and examine our idea empirically with the origin data set of the Thematic Apperception Test by Heckhausen and two additional data sets. We found generally higher values when using the category-scores as items instead of picture-scores. From an empirical and theoretical point of view, the estimated reliability is also superior to each category within a picture as item measuring. When comparing our suggestion with a multifaceted Rasch-model we provide evidence that our procedure better fits the underlying principles of PSE."

To determine the effect of age on energy homeostasis in response to experimental hyperthyroidism, we administered 200 μg triiodothyronine (T3) in 7- and 27-mo-old rats for 14 d. T3 increased energy expenditure (EE) in both the young and the old rats, although the old rats lost more weight (147 g) than the young rats (58 g) because of the discordant effect of T3 on food intake, with a 40% increase in the young rats, but a 40% decrease in the old ones. The increased food intake in the young rats corresponded with a T3-mediated increase in the appetite-regulating proteins agouti-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, and uncoupling protein 2 in the hypothalamus, but no increase occurred in the old rats. Evidence of mitochondrial biogenesis in response to T3 was similar in the soleus muscle and heart of the young and old animals, but less consistent in old plantaris muscle and liver. Despite the comparable increase in EE, T3's effect on mitochondrial function was modulated by age in a tissue-specific manner. We conclude that older rats lack compensatory mechanisms to increase caloric intake in response to a T3-induced increase in EE, demonstrating a detrimental effect of age on energy homeostasis.—Walrand, S., Short, K.

https://openalex.org/W2025117691,"Interferon tau (IFNT), produced by the mononuclear trophectoderm, signals the process of maternal recognition of pregnancy in ruminants. However, its expression in vivo and its transcriptional regulation are not yet well characterized. Objectives of this study were to determine conceptus IFNT gene isoforms expressed in the bovine uterus and to identify differences in promoter sequences of IFNT genes that differ in their expression. RNA-seq data analysis of bovine conceptuses on days 17, 20, and 22 (day 0 = day of estrus) detected the expression of two IFNT transcripts, IFNT1 and IFNTc1, which were indeed classified into the IFNT gene clade. RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR analyses also revealed that the expression levels of both IFNT mRNAs were highest on day 17, and then decreased on days 20 and 22. Bovine ear-derived fibroblast (EF) cells, a model system commonly used for bovine IFNT gene transcription study in this laboratory, were cotransfected with luciferase reporter constructs carrying upstream (positions −637 to +51) regions of IFNT1 or IFNTc1 gene and various transcription factor expression plasmids including CDX2, AP-1 (Jun) and ETS2. CDX2, either alone or with the other transcription factors, markedly increased luciferase activity. The upstream regions of IFNT1 and IFNTc1 loci were then serially deleted or point-mutated at potential CDX-, AP-1-, and ETS-binding sites. Compared to the wild-type constructs, deletion or mutation at CDX2 or ETS2 binding sites similarly reduced the luciferase activities of IFNT1- or IFNTc1-promoter constructs. However, with the AP-1 site mutated construct, IFNT1- and IFNTc1-reporters behaved differently. These results suggest that two forms of bovine conceptus IFNT genes are expressed in utero and their transcriptional regulations differ."
https://openalex.org/W1963942622,"Faithful chromosome segregation is required for preserving genomic integrity. Failure of this process may entail chromatin bridges preventing normal cytokinesis. To test whether RAD50, a protein normally involved in DNA double-strand break repair, is involved in abnormal cytokinesis and formation of chromatin bridges, we used immunocytochemical and protein interaction assays. RAD50 localizes to chromatin bridges during aberrant cytokinesis and subsequent stages of the cell cycle, either decorating the entire bridge or focally accumulating at the midbody zone. Ionizing radiation led to an ~4-fold increase in the rate of chromatin bridges in an ataxia telangiectatica mutated (ATM)-dependent manner in human RAD50-proficient fibroblasts but not in RAD50-deficient cells. Cells with a RAD50-positive chromatin bridge were able to continue cell cycling and to progress through S phase (44%), whereas RAD50 knockdown caused a deficiency in chromatin bridges as well as an ~4-fold prolonged duration of mitosis. RAD50 colocalized and directly interacted with Aurora B kinase and phospho-histone H3, and Aurora B kinase inhibition led to a deficiency in RAD50-positive bridges. Based on these observations, we propose that RAD50 is a crucial factor for the stabilization and shielding of chromatin bridges. Our study provides evidence for a hitherto unknown role of RAD50 in abnormal cytokinesis.—Schröder-Heurich, B., Wieland, B., Lavin, M. F., Schindler, D., Dörk, T.

https://openalex.org/W2149906615,"Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids requires the action of auxiliary enzymes, such as Δ3, Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerases. Here we describe a detailed biochemical, molecular, histological, and evolutionary characterization of Eci3, the fourth member of the mammalian enoyl-CoA isomerase family. Eci3 specifically evolved in rodents after gene duplication of Eci2. Eci3 is with 79% identity homologous to Eci2 and contains a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1. Subcellular fractionation of mouse kidney and immunofluorescence studies revealed a specific peroxisomal localization for Eci3. Expression studies showed that mouse Eci3 is almost exclusively expressed in kidney. By using immunohistochemistry, we found that Eci3 is not only expressed in cells of the proximal tubule, but also in a subset of cells in the tubulointerstitium and the glomerulus. In vitro, Eci3 catalyzed the isomerization of trans-3-nonenoyl-CoA to trans-2-nonenoyl-CoA equally efficient as Eci2, suggesting a role in oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. However, in contrast to Eci2, in silico gene coexpression and enrichment analysis for Eci3 in kidney did not yield carboxylic acid metabolism, but diverse biological functions, such as ion transport (P=7.1E-3) and tissue morphogenesis (P= 1.0E-3). Thus, Eci3 picked up a novel and unexpected role in kidney function during rodent evolution.—van Weeghel, M., Ofman, R., Argmann, C. A., Ruiter, J. P. N., Claessen, N., Oussoren, S. V., Wanders, R.

https://openalex.org/W2082079044,"Here we describe a simple affinity purification method for Shiga toxin 2e (Stx2e), a major causative factor of edema disease in swine. Escherichia coli strain MV1184 transformed with the expression plasmid pBSK-Stx2e produced Stx2e when cultivated in CAYE broth containing lincomycin. Stx2e bound to commercial D-galactose gel, containing α-D-galactose immobilized on agarose resin via a divinyl sulfone linker, and was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 4.5 M MgCl2. A small amount of Stx2e bound to another commercial α-galactose-immobilized agarose resin, but not to β-galactose-immobilized resin. In addition, Stx2e bound to thiophilic adsorbent resin containing β-mercaptoethanol immobilized on agarose resin via a divinyl sulfone, and was purified in the same manner as from D-galactose gel, but the Stx2e sample contained some contamination. These results indicate that Stx2e bound to D-galactose gel mainly through the divinyl sulfone group on the resin and to a lesser extent through α-D-galactose. With these methods, the yields of Stx2e and attenuated mutant Stx2e (mStx2e) from 1 L of culture were approximately 36 mg and 27.7 mg, respectively, and the binding capacity of the D-galactose gel and thiophilic adsorbent resin for Stx2e was at least 20 mg per 1 ml of resin. In addition, using chimeric toxins with prototype Stx2 which did not bind to thiophilic adsorbent resin and some types of mutant Stx2e and Stx2 which contained inserted mutations in the B subunits, we found that, at the least, asparagine (amino acid 17 of the B subunits) was associated with Stx2e binding to the divinyl sulfone group. The mStx2e that was isolated exhibited vaccine effects in ICR mice, indicating that these methods are beneficial for large-scale preparation of Stx2e toxoid, which protects swine from edema disease."
https://openalex.org/W1976483229,"The ability of mothers to transfer antibodies (Abs) to their young and the temporal persistence of maternal Abs in offspring constitute important life-history traits that can impact the evolution of host-parasite interactions. Here, we examined the effects of food availability and parental immunization on the transfer and persistence of maternal antibodies in nestling pigeons (Columba livia). This species can transmit maternal Abs to offspring before hatching through the egg yolk and potentially after hatching through crop milk. However, the role of this postnatal substance in immunity remains elusive. We used a full cross-fostering design to disentangle the effects of food limitation and parental immunization both before and after hatching on the levels and persistence of maternal Abs in chicks. Parents were immunized via injection with keyhole limpet hemocyanin antigens. Using an immunoassay that specifically detected the IgY antibodies that are known to be transmitted via the yolk, we found that the levels of anti-KLH Abs in newly hatched chicks were positively correlated with the levels of anti-KLH Abs in the blood of their biological mothers. However, this correlation was not present between chicks and their foster parents, suggesting limited IgY transfer via crop milk to the chick's bloodstream. Interestingly, biological mothers subjected to food limitation during egg laying transferred significantly fewer specific maternal Abs, which suggests that the transfer of antibodies might be costly for them. In addition, the persistence of maternal Abs in a chick's bloodstream was not affected by food limitation or the foster parents' anti-KLH Ab levels; it was only affected by the initial level of maternal anti-KLH Abs that were present in newly hatched chicks. These results suggest that the maternal transfer of Abs could be costly but that their persistence in an offspring's bloodstream may not necessarily be affected by environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2092589241,"Determining the semantic relatedness of two biomedical terms is an important task for many text-mining applications in the biomedical field. Previous studies, such as those using ontology-based and corpus-based approaches, measured semantic relatedness by using information from the structure of biomedical literature, but these methods are limited by the small size of training resources. To increase the size of training datasets, the outputs of search engines have been used extensively to analyze the lexical patterns of biomedical terms.In this work, we propose the Mutually Reinforcing Lexical Pattern Ranking (ReLPR) algorithm for learning and exploring the lexical patterns of synonym pairs in biomedical text. ReLPR employs lexical patterns and their pattern containers to assess the semantic relatedness of biomedical terms. By combining sentence structures and the linking activities between containers and lexical patterns, our algorithm can explore the correlation between two biomedical terms.The average correlation coefficient of the ReLPR algorithm was 0.82 for various datasets. The results of the ReLPR algorithm were significantly superior to those of previous methods."
