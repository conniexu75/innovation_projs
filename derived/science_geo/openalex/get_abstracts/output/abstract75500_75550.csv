https://openalex.org/W2047468905,"CENTRAL shoot fly, Atherigona indica infuscata Emd., is a serious pest of sorghum in the Old World. It is extremely common in East Africa and has been recorded from Brachiaria brizantha1, Sorghum verticilliflorum, Eleusine coracana, Pennisetum typhoides, Zea mays2, as well as cultivated sorghums. The fly is a pest of the young seedlings, and causes severe damage to the growing point. This usually leads to tillering; these tillers may or may not escape subsequent attack. If the former, the only effect is to lengthen the maturation period; if the latter, yield may be seriously affected."

We were thus surprised to find that extraction of DNP from chicken erythrocytes by the same procedure regularly gave high percentages of gel; of six preparations, five gave 90 per cent or more GDNP."

https://openalex.org/W2092871134,"THE effects of trace elements other than fluoride on dental caries have recently received increased attention. The results of numerous investigations, reviewed elsewhere1, have indicated that selenium is capable of increasing the susceptibility to caries, particularly when it is consumed during the formation of the teeth and incorporated into their structure. On the other hand, molybdenum appears to have a beneficial effect on caries2."

https://openalex.org/W2086057833,"Sweet and Hilleman1 detected SV40 in seed stocks of adenoviruses, types 1–7, and Gerber et al.2 reported the presence of viable SV40 in formalinized adenovirus vaccines. Yang and Melnick3 described SV40 contamination of both adenovirus stock and vaccine. Such contaminations were attributed to the SV40 flora in many of the ‘normal’ monkey kidney cell cultures used for propagation of adenovirus. The report presented here describes the isolation of a poxvirus contaminant from a seed stock of adenovirus type 12. The poxvirus had been propagated by us in undetected form through many passages of the adenovirus in HEp-2 cells."
