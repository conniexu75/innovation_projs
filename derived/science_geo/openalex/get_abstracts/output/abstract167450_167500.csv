Peptide sequence information was used to search the human EST data bases and complete coding sequences were assembled. The human mitochondrial 39 S subunit has 48 distinct proteins. Twenty eight of these are homologs of the Escherichia coli 50 S ribosomal proteins L1, L2, L3, L4, L7/L12, L9, L10, L11, L13, L14, L15, L16, L17, L18, L19, L20, L21, L22, L23, L24, L27, L28, L30, L32, L33, L34, L35, and L36. Almost all of these proteins have homologs in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial ribosomes. No mitochondrial homologs to prokaryotic ribosomal proteins L5, L6, L25, L29, and L31 could be found either in the peptides obtained or by analysis of the available data bases. The remaining 20 proteins present in the 39 S subunits are specific to mitochondrial ribosomes. Proteins in this group have no apparent homologs in bacterial, chloroplast, archaebacterial, or cytosolic ribosomes. All but two of the proteins has a clear homolog in D. melanogaster while all can be found in the genome of C. elegans. Ten of the 20 mitochondrial specific 39 S proteins have homologs in S. cerevisiae. Homologs of 2 of these new classes of ribosomal proteins could be identified in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome.

These proteins are components of the oligomeric complexes essential for oxidative phosphorylation and, hence, for the synthesis of about 90% of the ATP in eukaryotic organisms. The 55 S mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes consists of small (28 S) and large (39 S) subunits (1Eick D. Wedel A. Heumann H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 292-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to bacterial ribosomes which are about 65% RNA, mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes are only 33% RNA. The low percentage of RNA in these ribosomes reflects a reduction in the size of the rRNA and a compensating increase in the number of ribosomal proteins. For example, the small subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome contains a 12 S rRNA (about 950 nucleotides) and an estimated 29 proteins (2Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moseley A. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19363-19374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Escherichia coli 30 S subunit has a 16 S rRNA (1542 nucleotides in length) and 21 proteins (3Wittmann-Liebold B. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Ribosomal Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag, New York1985Google Scholar). The large subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome contains a 16 S rRNA (about 1560 nucleotides) and about 50 proteins (4Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J.

The identification of proteins in mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes has been challenging due to their low abundance. Recently 60 mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, 31 proteins from the large subunit and 29 proteins from the small subunit, have been characterized by different laboratories (2Koc E.C.

The traditional approach was to separate the proteins on two-dimensional gels or high performance liquid chromatography followed by sequence analysis using Edman chemistry or mass spectrometry (MS). More recently, proteins present in the 28 S subunit have been characterized by proteolytic digestion of whole subunits. Sequence information on the peptides present in this complex mixture was obtained by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).1 This strategy allowed the identification of 28 proteins of the small subunit including 14 proteins that had not previously been identified (2Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moseley A. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19363-19374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have extended this approach to the 39 S subunit. In addition to direct analysis of 39 S digests by LC/MS, aliquots of the total digest were fractionated prior to reversed-phase LC/MS analysis to maximize the number of peptides sequenced. In the first approach, a portion of the total digest was fractionated by affinity selection of Cys-containing peptides on a monomeric avidin column following the modification of these residues with a biotin-conjugated reagent. A second fractionation approach involved on-line strong cation exchange (SCX)/reversed-phase LC/LC/MS/MS. The sequence information obtained was used in data base searches to allow the deduction of the complete amino acid sequences of these proteins. The present work has allowed us to identify what we believe is close to the full complement of ribosomal proteins present in this subunit including 17 new mammalian mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal proteins. Of these, 4 have homologs in prokaryotic ribosomes while 13 are members of new classes of large subunit ribosomal proteins. Bovine mitochondrial ribosomes were prepared as described previously and the 55 S mitochondrial ribosomes were isolated on sucrose gradients (4Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These ribosomes were diluted in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, and 2 mmdithiothreitol to dissociate the 55 S ribosomes into 28 and 39 S subunits. Two-ml samples were then applied to 36-ml linear gradients (10–30% sucrose in the above buffer). Samples were subjected to centrifugation for 16 h at 24,000 rpm in a Beckman SW27 rotor. The gradients were fractionated and 39 S subunits were collected by centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 6 h in a Beckman Type-50 rotor. The 39 S subunit pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and stored at −70 °C. For each analysis, 5 pmol of purified 39 S subunits were digested with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako Chemicals) as described previously (9Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moseley A. Koc H. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32585-32591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Koc H.

Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar). Nanoscale capillary LC/MS/MS analyzes of 39 S digests were done using an Ultimate capillary LC system (LC Packings) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass) fitted with a Z-spray ion source as described previously (2Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moseley A. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19363-19374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition to the LC/MS/MS analysis, a multidimensional LC/LC/MS/MS approach similar to that described previously (16Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar) was performed using SCX in the first LC dimension and reversed-phase in the second dimension. Peptides were sequentially step eluted from the 300 μm × 5-mm SCX column (LC Packings) packed with PolySulfoethyl Aspartamide material (PolyLC) onto a reversed-phase “trapping” cartridge using a 5 mmKH2PO4 buffer, pH 3.0, containing 0, 25, 35, 50, 60, 75, 100, or 200 mm KCl. Peptides from each salt fraction were then analyzed by sequential reversed phase LC/MS/MS analyses. A second fractionation method involved the modification of Cys residues in an aliquot of 39 S subunits using the ICATTM D0 reagent from Applied Biosystems. The biotin tag on this reagent allowed purification of Cys-containing peptides using avidin affinity chromatography as described previously (17Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar, 18Spahr, C. S., Susin, S. A., Bures, E. J., Robinson, J. H., Davis, M. T., McGinley, M. D., Kroemer, G., and Patterson, S. D. (2000) Electrophoresis 1635–1650.Google Scholar). For this analysis, 5 pmol of 39 S subunits was used for in situ biotinylation with the ICATTM D0 reagent followed by digestion with trypsin as summarized in Fig. 1. Alkylation with the ICATTMreagent was performed on the Agilent sequencing cartridge in the same manner as when using 4-vinylpyridine (19Burkhart W. Angeletti R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press, New York1992: 399-406Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted with 80% acetonitrile or 40% acetonitrile, 40% isopropyl alcohol. Three different samples from this reaction were analyzed: 1) the total peptide mixture; 2) peptides not retained by the avidin column; and 3) bound peptides subsequently eluted from a 200-μl monomeric avidin column with 0.1% formic acid, 20% acetonitrile. Peptides in all three of these samples were analyzed by nanoscale LC/MS/MS. For all of the samples described above, uninterpreted peptide product ion spectra generated by LC/MS/MS were searched against the nonredundant protein data base and human and rat EST data bases for exact matches using the Mascot search program (20Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cotrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences obtained from Mascot searches of the protein and EST data bases were searched against the nonredundant protein data base using the FASTA algorithm (21Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9378) Google Scholar). EST data base and genomic DNA searches of the peptide sequences were performed using the BLAST search program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis and homology comparisons were done using the GCG DNA analysis software package (Wisconsin Package Version 10, 1999, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Vector NTI (Informax Inc.) and Biology WorkBench 3.2. The results were displayed using BOXSHADE (version 3.21, written by K. Hofmann and M. Baron). Prediction of the cleavage sites for the mitochondrial signal sequence was carried out using PSort and MitoProt II (23Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 24Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 770-786Crossref Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel analysis of the proteins present in bovine liver mitochondrial 39 S subunits suggested the presence of as many as 50–52 ribosomal proteins. These proteins were designated as L1 through L52 in order of decreasing molecular weights (4Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this nomenclature does not permit the easy comparison of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins to those of other systems. Hence, we have adopted a system of nomenclature in which proteins with prokaryotic homologs are given the same number as the corresponding ribosomal protein in E. coli (TableI). For example, MRP-L7/L12 is the mammalian mitochondrial homolog of bacterial L7/L12. Proteins without bacterial homologs are given the next available number. Since bacterial ribosomes have proteins designated L1 through L36, we began designating the new mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins beginning at MRP-L37. The 7 previously identified bovine mitochondrial 39 S proteins that do not have prokaryotic homologs are designated as MRP-L37 through MRP-L43 (6Goldschmidt-Reisin S. Kitakawa M. Herfurth E.

Open table in a new tab To maximize the number of 39 S peptides sequenced in these experiments, several approaches were employed (Fig.1). The basic approach involves analysis of proteolytic digests by nanoscale capillary LC/MS on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer operated in a data-dependent MS to MS/MS switching mode. Using this approach, the mass spectrometer acquires MS scans until peptides are detected eluting from the LC column. At this point, the mass spectrometer switches to MS/MS mode, fragmenting up to 8 co-eluting peptides per MS/MS switch before resetting to MS mode to look for additional peptides. Digestion of intact 39 S subunits is expected to generate about 750 peptides when digested with endoproteinase Lys-C, or about 1500 peptides when digested with trypsin. As a result of the extremely complex mixture of peptides present, each peak eluting from the LC column contained multiple peptides. Even though the mass spectrometer could rapidly acquire sequence data for up to 8 co-eluting peptides at a time, the number of peptides presented to the instrument for sequencing in a typical LC/MS/MS experiment overwhelmed the mass spectrometer's capacity for analysis. Thus, in a standard LC/MS/MS experiment, many peptides were never interrogated by MS/MS. By using the combination of approaches outlined in Fig. 1, the sequences of a total of 564 peptides were obtained. This number includes peptides observed in more than one run and peptides from co-purified contaminants. Of these, the sequences of 361 peptides were useful in allowing the identification of 47 large subunit ribosomal proteins. The large number of potential peptides generated from digestion of intact 39 S subunits raised the question of whether adequate sample coverage could be obtained to allow identification of all of the proteins present. To improve the odds of obtaining some peptide sequence from all of the proteins comprising the 39 S subunit, three types of analyses were used: 1) replicate nanoscale capillary LC/MS/MS of both trypsin and Lys-C digests; 2) Cys-affinity labeling/fractionation (18Spahr, C. S., Susin, S. A., Bures, E. J., Robinson, J. H., Davis, M. T., McGinley, M. D., Kroemer, G., and Patterson, S. D. (2000) Electrophoresis 1635–1650.Google Scholar); and 3) on-line multidimensional SCX-RP LC/LC/MS/MS (16Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). The most straightforward method for improving proteome coverage of 39 S proteins was found to be replicate analysis of identical digests of the subunit. For example, of 260 peptide matches obtained from triplicate LC/MS/MS analyses of a 39 S Lys-C digest, 141 peptides (55%) were sequenced in only one of the three replicates, 66 peptides (25%) were sequenced in only two of the three replicates, and 53 peptides (20%) were sequenced in all three replicate analyses. This data illustrates that the number of 39 S proteolytic peptides presented to the mass spectrometer for interrogation in an LC/MS/MS experiment exceeds the sequencing capacity of the instrument. Because chance (to some extent) plays a role in which peptide ions the instrument interrogates in each analysis (18Spahr, C. S., Susin, S. A., Bures, E. J., Robinson, J. H., Davis, M. T., McGinley, M. D., Kroemer, G., and Patterson, S. D. (2000) Electrophoresis 1635–1650.Google Scholar), simply repeating the analysis results in a substantial number of new peptides interrogated in each experiment. Another approach to improving proteome coverage is the use of multidimensional chromatographic separation of complex protein digests in conjunction with mass spectrometry. In this case, peptides are fractionated with an additional chromatographic step prior to the standard LC/MS/MS analysis. Thus, fewer peptides are presented to the mass spectrometer in each “fraction,” allowing a higher number of peptides to be interrogated. One such approach uses an on-line SCX-RP LC/LC separation (16Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). When applied to 39 S subunit proteolytic digests, 135 unique peptides were sequenced during SCX-RP LC/LC/MS/MS analysis. One peptide from MRP-L55 sequenced during this analysis (Fig.2) was the only peptide from MRP-L55 observed in any of our analyses. Another LC/LC approach taken was the use of Cys affinity labeling with off-line avidin affinity fractionation of Cys-containing peptides (17Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar, 18Spahr, C. S., Susin, S. A., Bures, E. J., Robinson, J. H., Davis, M. T., McGinley, M. D., Kroemer, G., and Patterson, S. D. (2000) Electrophoresis 1635–1650.Google Scholar). In this approach, 39 S subunits were treated with a reagent (ICATTM DO reagent) which alkylates Cys residues with a tag carrying a biotin moiety. The modified proteins were then cleaved with trypsin, and a portion of the resulting peptide mixture was used for peptide sequence analysis by LC/MS/MS. The remainder was applied to a monomeric avidin column to isolate the biotin-containing"

(1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28646–28651). Plk3 physically interacts with Cdc25C and phosphorylates this protein phosphatase predominantly on serine 216 (Ouyang, B., Li, W., Pan, H., Meadows, J., Hoffmann, I., and Dai, W. (1999) Oncogene 18, 6029–6036), suggesting that the role of Plk3 in mitosis is mediated, at least in part, through direct regulation of Cdc25C. Here we show that ectopic expression of a kinase-active Plk3 (Plk3-A) induced apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, the kinase activity of Plk3 was rapidly increased in an ATM-dependent manner, whereas that of Plk1 was markedly inhibited. Recombinant Plk3 phosphorylatedin vitro a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing p53, but not glutathione S-transferase alone. Recombinant Plk1 also phosphorylated p53 but on residues that differed from those targeted by Plk3. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays demonstrated that Plk3 physically interacted with p53 and that this interaction was enhanced upon DNA damage. In vitro kinase assays followed by immunoblotting showed that serine 20 of p53 was a target of Plk3. Furthermore, expression of a kinase-defective Plk3 mutant (Plk3K52R) resulted in significant reduction of p53 phosphorylation on serine 20, which was correlated with a decrease in the expression of p21 and with a concomitant increase in cell proliferation. These results strongly suggest that Plk3 functionally links DNA damage to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the p53 pathway.

Cdc5, a polo homolog in budding yeast, is modified in its mobility on denaturing gels in response to DNA damage, and this modification is dependent on MEC1, Rad53 (a Chk homolog), and Rad9 (16Cheng L. Hunke L. Hardy C.F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7360-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, a functionally defective Cdc5 mutant suppresses a Rad53 checkpoint defect, whereas overexpression of Cdc5 overrides checkpoint-induced cell cycle arrest (11Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Moreover, DNA damage appears to interfere with the activation of Plk1 in mammals, resulting in down-regulation of the kinase activity of this protein (18Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of Plk1 mutants that are nonresponsive to DNA damage overrides G2 arrest. Mammalian Plk3 is a structural homolog of Plk1 (19Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T.

Both Plk1 and Plk3 can rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of yeast Cdc5 mutants (1Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol.

However, evidence indicates that Plk3 functions differently from Plk1 in regulation of cell proliferation and oncogenesis in mammalian cells (1Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W.

Hoffmann I. Dai W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a site that is also targeted by Chk1 and Chk2 (10Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 216 of Cdc25C is inhibitory, which is due to sequestration of the protein phosphatase in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 protein (24Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). In this report, we have provided evidence indicating that Plk3 is involved in DNA damage checkpoint response and that it may target p53 in vivo through regulation of phosphorylation on serine 20. A model is proposed that explains the mechanism of action of Plk3 during genotoxic stress-induced activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, which results in cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis.RESULTSPlk3 is a structurally conserved protein serine/threonine kinase playing an important role in the regulation of M phase function (1Ouyang B.

A recent study indicates that overexpression of Plk3 induces chromatin condensation and programmed cell death (25Conn C.W. Hennigan R.F. Dai W Sanchez Y. Stambrook P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6826-6831PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the role of Plk3 in induction of apoptosis, we transfected GM00637 fibroblast cells with a plasmid construct expressing kinase-active Plk3 (Plk3-A) (1Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Ouyang B. Li W. Pan H. Meadows J. Hoffmann I. Dai W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation analyses (Fig. 1) revealed that transfection of Plk3-A, but not the vector alone, induced significant DNA fragmentation, indicative of apoptosis. Transfection of Plk3K52R in which lysine 52 was replaced with arginine also induced DNA fragmentation, albeit it was less significant than that of Plk3-A (Fig. 1 B).Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of Cdc25C is inhibitory (22Sanchez Y.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether the kinase activity of Plk3 is affected in cells subjected to DNA damage. Immunocomplex kinase assays with α-casein as substrate revealed that the kinase activity of Plk3 was increased more than 10-fold by exposure of A549 cells to the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin (Fig. 2, A and B). A549 cells were used because they expressed good levels of Plk3. The activation of Plk3 in response to other genotoxic stresses such as UV or H2O2 was also detected (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis indicated (Fig. 2 A) that Plk3 antigen was not increased upon adriamycin treatment, suggesting that the increase of Plk3 kinase activity was due to a post-translational mechanism(s). Given that the kinase activity of Plk1 has been shown to be down-regulated during activation of the DNA damage checkpoint (18Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and that the antibody to Plk3 used for our immunocomplex kinase assay did not cross-react with human Plk1 (Fig. 2 C), we measured the kinase activities of both Plk1 and Plk3 in the same A549 cells treated with adriamycin. Whereas little endogenous Plk3 kinase activity was detected under control conditions (Fig. 2 D,lane 1), activation of Plk3 was apparent 10 min after exposure of the cells to adriamycin; in contrast, Plk1 was constitutively active under basal conditions (Fig. 2 D,lane 4), and its activity was markedly inhibited in response to adriamycin treatment (lanes 5 and6). Thus, Plk1 and Plk3 appear to be differentially regulated in response to DNA damage.Figure 2Activation of Plk3 in response to DNA damage. A, A549 cells were incubated with 100 μm adriamycin (ADR) for the indicated times, after which cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies to Plk3.

Recombinant Plk1 migrates slightly slower than the cellular one due to addition of a FLAG tag at the amino terminus.D, A549 cells were incubated with 100 μmadriamycin for the indicated times, after which cells were lysed and subjected to IP with antibodies to either Plk3 or Plk1, as indicated.

Caffeine not only blocked the activation of Plk3 by adriamycin but also inhibited the basal kinase activity of this protein (Fig. 3, A and B). To further confirm the dependence of Plk3 activation on ATM, we analyzed the Plk3 kinase activity in an ATM-deficient cell line (ATCC number CRL-7201) that had been treated with adriamycin for various times. No increase in Plk3 activity upon DNA damage was detected in the ATM-deficient cells (Fig. 3, C and D,lanes 2–4).Figure 3Plk3 activation is ATM-dependent.

Given that Plk3 phosphorylates the same residue of Cdc25C (serine 216) as that targeted by Chk1 and Chk2, we investigated whether Plk3 also phosphorylates p53 in vitro. Recombinant histidine-tagged Plk3-A (His6-Plk3-A) phosphorylated GST-p53 (Fig.4 A, lane 2) but not GST alone (lane 5), indicating that Plk3 targets the p53 moiety of GST-p53. Plk3K52R phosphorylated GST-p53 to a greatly reduced extent (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) compared with that observed with Plk3-A (lane 2). Recombinant (His6)-Plk1 also phosphorylated GST-p53 (Fig.4 A, lane 9) but not GST alone (data not shown). Unlike His6-Plk3, His6-Plk1 exhibited a high level of autophosphorylation activity (Fig.4 A, lane 9).Figure 4Phosphorylation of p53 on different residues by Plk3-A and Plk1.

Stambrook P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6826-6831PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our observation that both Plk3 and Plk1 phosphorylate p53 suggested that these two kinases may target different residues of the tumor suppressor protein. Whereas p53 phosphorylated by Plk3 yielded two major phosphopeptides in phosphopeptide mapping analysis, p53 phosphorylated by Plk1 yielded four major phosphopeptides (Fig. 4 B). Further analysis of the phosphopeptide maps indicated that peptides a and e were specific to Plk3-phosphorylated p53 and that peptides b, c, and d were unique to Plk1-phosphorylated p53.Our observation that Plk3 phosphorylates p53 in vitrosuggested that the two proteins might physically interact in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.5 A) revealed that both antibodies (from two different sources) to p53, but not control antibodies to CD45, precipitated Plk3 from GM00637 cell lysates. Furthermore, Ni2+-NTA resin conjugated with His6-Plk3, but not Ni2+-NTA resin alone, precipitated p53 from the cell lysates (Fig. 5 B). The amount of p53 precipitated by the His6-Plk3-conjugated resin was markedly increased by prior exposure of the cells to adriamycin (Fig.5 B, lanes 3 and 4), although treatment with this drug for 30 min did not affect the total amount of p53 present in the cells (lanes 5 and6). Proteins eluted from both His6-Plk3-conjugated resin and control resin were also blotted for the presence of phospho-p53. Fig. 5 B shows that His6-Plk3 resin precipitated serine 20-phosphorylated p53 and that the amount of the phosphorylated p53 pulled down by His6-Plk3 was significantly increased following adriamycin treatment. These results thus suggest that activation of p53 promotes its interaction with Plk3.Figure 5Plk3 interacts with p53 and phosphorylates the tumor suppressor protein on serine 20. A, lysates from GM00637 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with polyclonal (lanes 1 and2) or monoclonal (lanes 5 and6) antibodies to p53 or with monoclonal antibodies to CD45 as a negative control (lanes 3 and 4). The positions of bands corresponding to Plk3 and immunoglobulin G (IgG) are indicated. B, His6-Plk3-A immobilized on Ni2+-NTA resin (lanes 3 and4) or resin alone (lanes 1 and2) was incubated with lysates of GM00637 cells that had been pretreated for 30 min with (lanes 2 and4) or without (lanes 1 and3) adriamycin. Proteins that interacted specifically with the His6-Plk3-A-conjugated resin or resin alone were eluted and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to p53 or serine 20-phosphorylated p53. 50 μg of the cell lysates were also directly subjected to immunoblot analysis (lanes 5 and6). C, GST-p53 and GST-p53S20A were incubated in vitro in the kinase buffer with His6-Plk3-A, and the phosphorylated proteins (lanes 3 and 4) as well as the nonphosphorylated GST-p53 (lane 2) were subject to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to serine 20-phosphorylated p53. Lysates from GM00637 cells treated with or without adriamycin were used as controls for immunoblotting. D, the blot as shown inC was stained with Coomassie Blue as a loading control. Some degradations of GST-p53 were observed.

The direct interaction of Plk3 with p53 and the observation that Chk1 and Chk2 also phosphorylate p53 on serine 20 prompted us to examine whether the serine 20 residue of p53 was a phosphorylation target of Plk3. In vitro kinase assays followed by immunoblotting showed (Fig. 5 C, lane 2) that purified GST-p53 was not recognized by an antibody to serine 20-phosphorylated p53. However, GST-p53 phosphorylatedin vitro by Plk3 exhibited a strong phosphoserine 20 epitope (lane 3). Furthermore, when an equal amount of GST-p53S20A, a mutant in which serine 20 was replaced with alanine, was used as an in vitro substrate, no phosphoserine 20 epitope was detected (Fig. 5 C, lane 4). Given that p53 serine 20 phosphorylation and Plk3 activation are induced by a variety of genome toxic stresses, these observations suggest that the serine 20 residue may be a directin vivo target of Plk3.To establish Plk3 serine 20 phosphorylation of p53 in vivo, we transfected both p53 and p53S20A expression plasmids into HeLa cells, which constitutively express Plk3 but not p53. Western blot analysis showed (Fig.6 A) that transfected p53, but not p53S20A mutant protein, was constitutively phosphorylated on serine 20. DNA damage induced by adriamycin significantly enhanced serine 20 phosphorylation of the transfected p53, indicating that the pathway leading to p53 serine 20 phosphorylation was intact, albeit endogenous p53 was inactivated in this tumor cell line.Figure 6A, HeLa cells transfected with p53, p53S20A , or vector were treated with or without adriamycin for 30 min. Cell lysates were then analyzed for serine 20-phosphorylated p53 as well as total p53. The antibody to p53 recognized an epitope between residues 11 and 25 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Thus, serine 20 mutation significantly compromised the detection. B, HeLa cells were cotransfected with various expression plasmids for 24 h as indicated. Cell lysates were collected and blotted for Plk3, serine 20-phosphorylated p53, total p53, and p21. Recognition of total p53 by the p53 antibody (Pharmingen) was not affected by the serine 20 mutation. The results were representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the effect of change in Plk3 activity on p53 phosphorylation, HeLa cells were cotransfected with plasmid constructs expressing p53 and Plk3K52R. Western blot analysis showed (Fig. 6 B) that p53 was expressed and phosphorylated on serine 20 and that expression of Plk3K52R significantly reduced the level of p53 phosphorylation on serine 20 (lane 6). To determine the consequence of serine 20 phosphorylation of p53 on its target gene expression, we measured p21 level in cells expressing p53 and/or the Plk3 dominant mutant. We have consistently observed (Fig. 6 B) that while little p21 was detected in parental HeLa cells or cells transfected with vectors alone (lanes 1 and 2), ectopic expression of p53 greatly induced p21 expression (lane 3). Expression of p53S20A also induced p21 expression that was about 25% of that induced by wild-type p53 (lane 4). Further, expression of the Plk3K52R greatly reduced the ability of p53 to induce p21 expression (comparelanes 3 and 6), which was consistent with the reduced serine 20 phosphorylation of p53 as well as p53 protein levels. These observations thus clearly demonstrate that phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20 plays a significant role in activating p21 expression.We then determined the colony-forming efficiency of HeLa cells that were cotransfected with Plk3K52R and p53. Fig.7 A shows that p53 suppressed colony formation of HeLa cells. Plk3K52R alone also suppressed the colony formation. However, when cotransfected with p53, Plk3K52R significantly blocked p53-mediated suppression of colony formation of HeLa cells. Independent assays using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method confirmed that Plk3K52R effectively blocked the ability of p53 to inhibit HeLa cell proliferation (Fig. 7 B). It is interesting that Plk3K52R also had an effect on p53S20A in terms of cell growth. This effect was likely to be mediated by inhibition of phosphorylation of other serine/threonine sites by Plk3K52R because Plk3 phosphorylates p53 on multiple sites in vitro (Fig. 4 B).Figure 7Plk3K52R blocks p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W1973586624,"The effects of neurotrophic factors on translational activation were investigated in cortical neurons. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increased protein synthesis within 30 min, whereas insulin produced a weaker enhancement of protein synthesis. BDNF-triggered protein synthesis was inhibited by LY294002, PD98059, and rapamycin, whereas the effect of insulin was unaffected by PD98059. To explore the mechanisms underlying this effect, the protein phosphorylation cascades that lead to the activation of translation initiation in neurons were examined. BDNF induced the phosphorylation of both eukaryote initiation factor (eIF) 4E and its binding protein (eIF4E-binding protein-1). The former reaction was inhibited by PD98059, whereas the latter was inhibited by LY294002 or rapamycin. In agreement, BDNF induced the phosphorylation of mammalian TOR (target of rapamycin) and enhanced its kinase activity toward eIF4E-binding protein-1. In contrast, insulin failed to activate MAPK and did not induce the phosphorylation of eIF4E. Since BDNF and insulin increased the activity of eIF2B and eIF2, the only difference between them was eIF4E phosphorylation. Thus, this may explain the lower activity of insulin in potentiating neuronal protein synthesis. These results suggest strongly that BDNF simultaneously activates multiple signaling cascades consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mammalian TOR, and MAPK to enhance translation initiation in neurons.

Although post-translational modification can modulate short-term neural plasticity, longer term plastic changes seem to require novel protein synthesis (3Bailey C.H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc.

There is a certain phase of long-term potentiation and long-term depression, which are the model paradigms of the cellular basis of learning and memory, that is translation-dependent, as has been revealed by pharmacological approaches (5Nayak A.

Moreover, learning and memory processes in vivo are known to require novel protein synthesis under various conditions (8Davis H.P. Squire L.R. Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 9Nader K. Schafe G.E. LeDoux J.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). The types of external stimuli that trigger neuronal translation have not yet been fully determined. Although many pharmacological studies have suggested the involvement of novel protein synthesis in synaptic plasticity, the molecular basis of translational activation in neurons remains to be elucidated. Many growth factors such as insulin are known to influence translation, and their signaling cascades have been studied with respect to cell growth or proliferation in several types of cell. In this study, the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)1 on rapid protein synthesis and the translational control mechanisms in cortical neurons were characterized and compared with those of insulin. BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family, which promotes the differentiation, maturation, and survival of peripheral and central nervous system neurons (10Lewin G. Barde Y.-A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that BDNF and its cognate receptor TrkB may be important for synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (11Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 12Nawa H. Saito M. Nagano T. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1997; 11: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Takei N. Nawa H. Hum. Cell. 1998; 11: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar). For example, it has been reported that BDNF is intrinsically involved in the establishment of long-term potentiation (14Korte M. Carroll P. Wolf E. Brem G. Thoenen H. Bonhoffer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8856-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). In addition, BDNF enhances basal neurotransmission in hippocampal synapses in a translation-dependent manner (15Kang H. Schuman E.M. Science. 1996; 273: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the rate of translations is regulated mainly at the initiation phase. The following reactions have been suggested as essential regulatory steps for initiation and for overall protein synthesis (16Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control in Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 1-32Google Scholar). Eukaryote initiation factor (eIF) 4E recognizes the 7-methylguanosine 5-triphosphate cap structure and binds to mRNA. The eIF4E·RNA complex then binds to eIF4G, associating with eIF4A. The complex of eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A, which is called eIF4F, associates with mRNA and a 40 S ribosomal subunit, which leads to the activation of initiation. eIF4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1) behaves as a negative regulator of initiation that binds to eIF4E and prevents the formation of the eIF4F complex in translationally silent states. The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at serine and threonine residues makes it dissociate from eIF4E (17Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N Translational Control.

Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Various extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, hormones, cytokines, and mitogens induce the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in many types of primary cultured cells or cell lines (16Mathews M.B.

Studies of the signal transduction cascade that leads to the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 show the importance of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mTOR (also called FRAP/RAFT1) as upstream kinases that activate this cascade (23Beretta L.

Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of eIF4E is performed by Mnk1, which is activated by MAPK or p38 (29Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 30Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.-C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These modifications of phosphorylation are reported to be directly related to (4EBP1) or to be suspected of being related to (eIF4E) the rate of translation. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of cap-binding processes in central neurons remain to be established. To address this and to further our understanding of neuronal translation mechanisms, we first identified BDNF as a translational enhancer of primary cultured cortical neurons by activating the PI3K-Akt, mTOR, and MAPK pathways. We then show that BDNF induces the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and decreases the association between 4EBP1 and eIF4E as well as the activation of mTOR. BDNF also increases the phosphorylation of eIF4E. Another regulatory step of initiation depends on eIF2, which is required for the formation of the ternary complex eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi (31Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30337-30340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). eIF2 is essential for priming each 40 S ribosomal subunit. eIF2B is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that catalyzes the eIF2·GDP to eIF2·GTP exchange, thereby regulating eIF2 activity. eIF2B activity is regulated by the phosphorylation of its ε-subunit by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (32Welsh G.I. Miyamoto S. Price N.T. Safer B. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11410-11413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the activities of eIF2B and eIF2 together with the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in response to BDNF and insulin. Both of the factors activate eIF2B and eIF2. In contrast to the effects of BDNF, we have shown that insulin produces a weaker enhancement of protein synthesis and fails to induce the phosphorylation of eIF4E. Although it has been reported that growth factors activate each translation factor, the link between actual protein synthesis and the simultaneous activation of multiple factors is not fully understood, especially in neurons. In this study, we demonstrate that the simultaneous phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and eIF4E, which is induced by BDNF, appears to be required for the full activation of translation in neurons.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27620-27624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebral cortices were removed from 18–19-day-old embryonic rat fetuses and dissociated using papain/DNase I. Neurons were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/cm2 and cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nissui) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was changed every 3 or 4 days, and neurons were used for each assay after 10–14 days in culture. Cortical neurons cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated with the serum-free medium for 8–12 h to starve the neurons of serum. The medium was then changed to a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and methionine-free DMEM. Neurons were incubated with 10 μCi of [35S]methionine for 15 min. Growth factor stimulation was for 30 min, unless indicated otherwise. Inhibitors were added to the culture 10 min prior to BDNF stimulation. The labeling was stopped by three washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and neurons were lysed in 500 μl of 0.5 m NaOH containing 10 mg/ml casein as a carrier. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then collected in Eppendorf tubes. An equal volume of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (20%) was added to each sample and then centrifuged. Free methionine and methionine that had been incorporated into proteins were estimated by counting the radioactivity of the supernatant and the pellet, respectively. We calculated the ratio of [35S]methionine precipitated to the total [35S]methionine taken up into neurons. Neurons cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated with the serum-free medium for 8–12 h to starve the cells of serum. The medium was changed to phosphate-free DMEM after washing three times with the same medium and then incubated with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h. Neurons were used for immunoprecipitation. For the immunoprecipitation of eIF4E and 4EBP1, neurons were washed three times with ice-cold TN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and 20 mm NaF. Neurons were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4) containing CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mmNa3VO4, and 20 mm NaF. The supernatants from the centrifuged samples were preincubated with protein G-Sepharose for 30 min to adsorb nonspecific binding and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Protein G-Sepharose was incubated with the samples for a further 3 h. The immunocomplex was then washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to each sample and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Each sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and autoradiography was performed after drying the gel. mTOR immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously (30Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.-C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In a co-immunoprecipitation experiment, neurons were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing CompleteTM, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 20 mm NaF and immunoprecipitated with anti-4EBP1 antibody. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with anti-eIF4E antibody to detect the association between 4EBP1 and eIF4E. Pull-down assay using 7-methyl-GTP (m7GTP)-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed as described for the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (35Takei N. Sasaoka K. Inoue K. Takahashi M. Endo Y. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and sonicated in TN buffer at pH 7.5, and protein concentrations were determined. Protein samples of the same size (25–40 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and then exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution; Cappel). Peroxidase activity was visualized on x-ray film after being reacted with Renaissance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). eIF2 was partially purified for the measurement of eIF2B activity according to a previously reported method (36Alcazar A. Martin M.E. Soria E. Rodriguez S. Fando J.L. Salinas M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat brains (∼50 g) were homogenized and centrifuged. The supernatant was precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The dialyzed sample was then applied to heparin-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, and DEAE-Sepharose (HiTrapTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted by stepwise salt solutions. Activity and protein concentrations were checked in each elute. The specific activity of partially purified eIF2 was >1000-fold greater than that of the initial homogenate. eIF2B activity was assayed as reported by Quevedo et al.(37Quevedo C. Alcazar A. Salinas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19192-19197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A lysate of cultured neurons (100 μg) was incubated with the binary complex eIF2·[3H]GDP, which had been prepared by a method previously reported (36Alcazar A. Martin M.E. Soria E. Rodriguez S. Fando J.L. Salinas M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The radioactivity of [3H]GDP remaining bound to eIF2 during 3 min of the GDP exchange reaction was counted. eIF2 activity was measured according to a previously reported method (36Alcazar A. Martin M.E. Soria E. Rodriguez S. Fando J.L. Salinas M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Neurons were lysed and incubated with [35S]methionine and tRNAi in the presence of GTP. Formation of the ternary complex GTP·[35S]methionine·tRNAi that was retained on nitrocellulose membrane was determined by counting radioactivity. Since it is known that growth factors or serum stimulates protein synthesis in a wide variety of cells, the effects of various neurotrophic factors on the rate of protein synthesis were evaluated in primary cultured cortical neurons. Serum-starved neurons were treated with or without BDNF (100 ng/ml), neurotrophin-3 (100 ng/ml), nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml), insulin (1 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (50 ng/ml), or ciliary neurotrophic factor (10 ng/ml) for 30 min, and the incorporation of [35S]methionine into the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was calculated as a measure of the rate of protein synthesis. Among the neurotrophic factors tested, BDNF produced a marked enhancement of protein synthesis during the 30-min period. Insulin, a well known activator of translation in various cell types, also had a effect on protein synthesis in neurons (Fig.1, upper panel). None of these neurotrophic factors affected the uptake of [35S]methionine into neurons significantly (e.g. 21,098 ± 420 cpm in control neurons and 22,360 ± 412 cpm in BDNF-treated neurons (n = 6)). To examine further the effects of BDNF and insulin on the rate of protein synthesis, neurons were treated with BDNF or insulin at different concentrations. Treatment of cortical neurons with BDNF for 30 min increased the rate of protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, center panel). The effects of insulin under the same conditions used for BDNF treatment are shown in Fig. 1 (lower panel). The effects of kinase inhibitors on BDNF-induced protein synthesis were investigated to improve our understanding of its signaling pathways. Pretreatment with K252a, a relatively selective Trk kinase inhibitor, completely blocked BDNF-induced protein synthesis (Fig.2 A), indicating that BDNF induces novel protein synthesis through TrkB signaling. Therefore, the downstream signaling cascades from TrkB (a MAPK pathway and a PI3K-Akt pathway) were examined further. BDNF-induced protein synthesis was completely inhibited by either LY294002, which is a potent inhibitor of PI3K, or PD98059, which is an MEK inhibitor. Rapamycin, an immunosuppressant that inhibits the kinase activity of mTOR, also suppressed the effect of BDNF-induced protein synthesis. In contrast, pp2, an inhibitor of Src family kinases, had no effect on BDNF-induced protein synthesis (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest strongly that BDNF requires the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and mTOR pathways to trigger translational up-regulation in neurons. To compare the signaling pathways activated by BDNF and insulin, the effects of kinase inhibitors on insulin-induced protein synthesis were also examined. Although the action of insulin was completely blocked by either LY294002 or rapamycin, it was not affected by PD98059, suggesting that the MAPK pathway is not involved in the insulin-induced weak enhancement of protein synthesis. Rates of protein synthesis are regulated mainly by the initiation step of translation. The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and the resulting dissociation of 4EBP1 and eIF4E are key steps that lead to the activation of initiation. Therefore, the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by BDNF was examined. Serum-starved neurons were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) for 2 h and stimulated with BDNF for 5 min. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-4EBP1 antibody. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. BDNF increased the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, which was inhibited by LY294002 or rapamycin (Fig. 3 A). The radioactivity of each band was quantified and is shown in Fig. 3 B. A co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the dissociation of 4EBP1 and eIF4E was induced by BDNF and blocked by either LY294002 or rapamycin (Fig. 3 A). PD98059 had no effect on the phosphorylation states of 4EBP1 and the dissociation of 4EBP1 and eIF4E that was induced by BDNF. The identity of a phosphorylation pattern of Akt and 4EBP1 (Fig. 3 A) confirmed previous reports that Akt regulates 4EBP1 phosphorylation (26Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 28Takata M. Ogawa W. Kitamura T. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Klip A. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20611-20618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that BDNF increases the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and thus reduces the association between 4EBP1 and eIF4E via the activation of Akt. Since rapamycin inhibited the effect of BDNF on both protein synthesis and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, the activation of mTOR, a molecular target of rapamycin, was examined. Serum-starved neurons were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) for 2 h and stimulated with BDNF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. Equal protein amounts of cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-mTOR antibody. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Treatment of cortical neurons with BDNF caused marked phosphorylation of mTOR, a reaction that was suppressed by LY294002 (Fig.4, A, upper panel; and B). Total levels of mTOR protein were unchanged by BDNF (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). Furthermore, mTOR immunoprecipitates from BDNF-treated neurons strongly phosphorylated GST-fused recombinant 4EBP1 in vitro (Fig. 4, Cand D). This kinase activity was inhibited by pretreatment of neurons with rapamycin prior to immunoprecipitation. These results suggest the involvement of the mTOR pathway in BDNF-induced translational activation. Since PD98059 inhibited the protein synthesis induced by BDNF, translation initiation enhanced by BDNF is likely to be affected by the MAPK cascade. Neurons were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) for 2 h and stimulated with BDNF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-eIF4E antibody, and then SDS-PAGE was performed. BDNF increased the phosphorylation of eIF4E within 5 min (Fig.5) without affecting the amount of eIF4E (data not shown). The BDNF-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E was completely inhibited by PD98059, but not by LY294002. The pattern of phosphorylation of eIF4E was similar to that of MAPK, as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (Fig. 5). In addition, pull-down assay showed that BDNF increased the amount of m7GTP-bound eIF4E and that the binding was inhibited by PD98059. These results, the phosphorylation of eIF4E and its association with m7GTP, are consistent with the results of the pharmacological analysis of BDNF-induced protein synthesis. Both BDNF and insulin enhanced protein synthesis in neurons, but the degree of enhancement differed. To elucidate the cause of the difference, the effects of BDNF and insulin on the activities of eIF2B and eIF2 were examined. As shown in Fig. 6 (A andB), both factors increased eIF2B activity as well as eIF2 activity. BDNF and insulin also induced the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (Fig. 6 C), which is known to regulate eIF2B activity. A slight reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation (a negative index of eIF2 activity) (Fig. 6 D) and a significant increase in eIF2 activity were induced by either BDNF or insulin. The activation of signaling molecules, which is involved in BDNF- or insulin-induced initiation, was further compared. As shown in Fig. 7, BDNF induced the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and eIF4E as well as that of Akt, MAPK, and Mnk1, whereas insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, but not eIF4E. In addition, BDNF (but not insulin) increased the binding of eIF4E to m7GTP. The observed differences in translational activation may be ascribed to the limited effect of insulin: insulin activated only the PI3K-Akt cascade in neurons. Coordinated stimulation of the Akt, mTOR, and MAPK pathways may be necessary for the full activation of translation in neurons. Among the several neurotrophic factors tested, BDNF showed the strongest effect on protein synthesis. Insulin, a well known stimulator of translation in other cell types, is less potent even at its highest dose in cortical neurons, although its receptor(s) are widely expressed in and induce biological and biochemical effects on these cells (38Heidenreich K.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 692: 72-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Yamada M. Tanabe K. Wada K. Shimoke K. Ishikawa Y. Ikeuchi T. Koizumi S. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 940-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Likewise, although their receptors are expressed and their biological effects have been reported (40Linday R.M. Wiegand S.J. Alter C.A. DiStefano P.S. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 182-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 41Yamada M. Enokido Y. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. Eur. J.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3124-3134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor had no effects and neurotrophin-3 had little effect (from 1 to 300 ng/ml) on protein synthesis in cortical neurons. The action of BDNF was dose-dependent and mediated by TrkB receptors. The culture medium used in this study contained 10% serum, so a considerable proportion (10–20%) of astrocytes was present. Although astrocytes have a basal level of protein synthesis, they do not express full-length TrkB (43Altar C.A. Siuciak J.A. Wright P. Ip I.P. Lindsay R.M. Wiegand S.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1389-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Indeed, BDNF increased neither the protein synthesis nor the phosphorylation of signaling molecules in a pure astrocyte culture (data not shown). Thus, the effects of BDNF shown in this study must be attributable to neuronal responses. Rather, the net increase in neuronal protein synthesis induced by BDNF may be higher than is suggested by the present data because it included the basal protein synthesis of astrocytes, which is not affected by BDNF. Actinomycin D, an mRNA synthesis inhibitor, had no effect on BDNF-induced protein synthesis (data not shown), suggesting strongly that the process involves transcription-independent translational control. Pharmacological analysis showed that the BDNF effect occurred downstream of PI3K pathway activation. The finding that wortmannin, another inhibitor of PI3K, blocked the effect of BDNF on protein synthesis confirmed this conclusion (data not shown). PD98059 and U0126 (data not shown), both of which are MEK inhibitors, also inhibited BDNF-induced protein synthesis. These results suggest the additional involvement of MAPK signaling in BDNF-induced protein synthesis. BDNF activates both the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling cascades; the link between these cascades and the translation machinery in neurons has not yet been determined. The inhibition of each cascade is enough to block the effect of BDNF on protein synthesis. These observations suggest strongly that simultaneous activation of both of these pathways is required for BDNF-induced protein synthesis. The importance of co-activation of these cascades also seems to be supported by the weaker effect of insulin on protein synthesis in neurons. The action of insulin was unaffected by PD98059, suggesting that it is independent of MAPK pathway activation. It has yet to be determined why PD98059 or LY294002 causes a complete block of BDNF-induced protein synthesis. There may be a complex synergy between these signaling pathways. In addition to the pharmacological approaches, the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 was examined to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BDNF-induced translational activation. Upon stimulation by serum or insulin, 4EBP1 is phosphorylated and liberated from eIF4E (17Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 249-269Google Scholar, 18Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar). We have shown that BDNF triggers the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 together with the dissociation of 4EBP1 from eIF4E. The results that 4EBP1 phosphorylation and dissociation from eIF4E induced by BDNF are events that occur downstream of the PI3K pathway (but not of the MAPK pathway) are in good agreement with the results of previous studies performed using mitotic cells. Although 4EBP1 is phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro (44Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), insulin induces 4EBP1 phosphorylation via the PI3K pathway without activating the MAPK pathway in HEK293 and Swiss 3T3 cells (45von Manteuffel S.R. Gingras A.-C. Ming X.F. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is direct evidence that PI3K and Akt are the upstream signaling molecules for 4EBP1 (27Gingras A.-C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 28Takata M. Ogawa W. Kitamura T. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Klip A. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

The inhibitory effects of rapamycin on both protein synthesis and 4EBP1 phosphorylation suggest a role for mTOR in BDNF-induced translational activation. Rapamycin, which was reported to inhibit protein synthesis in aplysia neurons (46Casadio A. Martin K.C. Giustetto M. Zhu H. Chen M. Bartsch D. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 221-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), is an immunosuppressant that binds to FKBP12. The complex then binds to and inhibits the activity of mTOR. mTOR has been reported to have a kinase activity that relays the signal from PI3K and Akt to 4EBP1 and that regulates 4EBP1 phosphorylation in several cells (47Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 48Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A.

J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear whether the role of mTOR in the regulation of 4EBP1 is direct or indirect (50Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 51Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), the activation of mTOR by BDNF seems to be essential for BDNF-triggered protein synthesis. We found that BDNF induced mTOR phosphorylation, which was inhibited by LY294002. In addition, in vitrokinase assay using mTOR immunoprecipitates and GST-4EBP1 showed that BDNF increased the kinase activity of mTOR toward 4EBP1. Although it remains to be established whether mTOR phosphorylates 4EBP1 directly, mTOR immunoprecipitates, which may contain mTOR-associated kinases, do phosphorylate 4EBP1 in vitro. These results suggest strongly that the BDNF-induced phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in neurons is mediated by the mTOR pathway. mTOR is reported to interact with gephyrin, a molecule that is necessary for the clustering of glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (53Sabatini D.M. Barrow R.K. Blackshaw S. Burnett P.E. Lai M.M. Field M.E. Bahr B.A. Kirsch J. Betz H. Snyder S.H. Science. 1999; 284: 1161-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, mTOR may play a predominant role in BDNF-induced translation at synapses. Although the MAPK pathway was found not to be involved in either the BDNF-induced phosphorylation of 4EBP1 or the association between 4EBP1 and eIF4E, the enhancement of protein synthesis by BDNF was blocked by PD98059, which is an MEK inhibitor. This suggests that another signaling pathway contributes to BDNF-induced protein synthesis. To characterize that pathway, the phosphorylation of eIF4E was examined in detail since previous reports have shown that MAPK activation leads to eIF4E phosphorylation (54Flynn A. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and an increase in protein synthesis (55Kleijn M. Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A role of eIF4E phosphorylation in translation has been examined in NIH3T3 and Rat-2 fibroblasts: overexpression of wild-type eIF4E (but not of a negative mutant of eIF4E) results in a high rate of protein synthesis and malignant transformation (56Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In addition, BDNF increased the binding of eIF4E to m7GTP, and the binding was inhibited by PD98059, which was parallel to the levels of eIF4E phosphorylation. Although the direct relation between eIF4E phosphorylation and cap binding is unclear, the phosphorylation is suspected of playing a role in the regulation of the eIF4F-mRNA interaction (19Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Translational Control in Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar). We have currently no information that would explain why rapamycin reduces eIF4E phosphorylation. There may be a novel signaling pathway that links mTOR and eIF4E, or there may be cross-talk between them. The results of this study suggest that BDNF enhances protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of MAPK-eIF4E cascade as well as through the previously mentioned PI3K-Akt-4EBP1 and mTOR-4EBP1 cascades. Considering the results of pharmacological studies of protein synthesis (Fig. 2), the simultaneous phosphorylation of both 4EBP1 and eIF4E may be necessary for the BDNF-induced activation of translation in neurons. Many studies have shown that insulin induces translational activation through multiple processes in various cell types (57Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, insulin exhibited somewhat different effects from BDNF on translation initiation in neurons. Although both factors equally activated eIF2B and eIF2 as well as induced the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, BDNF (but not insulin) induced the phosphorylation of eIF4E and increased its binding to the cap analog. The lack of MAPK and Mnk1 activation by insulin signaling in neurons may be responsible for the different eIF4E phosphorylation states. The fact that insulin fails to activate multiple cascades may explain its lower activity on protein synthesis. In addition to the effects of BDNF on the initiation processes examined in this study, BDNF may influence elongation processes in neurons. Further analysis is required to clarify whether BDNF affects other initiation or elongation mechanisms in neurons. There are numerous reports demonstrating that novel protein synthesis is necessary for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (1Klintsova A.Y. Greenough W.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Martin K.C. Barad M. Kandel E.R. Curr. Opin.

BDNF may contribute to long-term synaptic plasticity through translational activation via multiple signaling cascades. The present findings may provide the missing link between BDNF and translation-dependent synaptic plasticity.

https://openalex.org/W2145112854,"Recent studies have shown independently that presenilin-1 (PS1) null mutants and familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-linked mutants should both down-regulate signaling of the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, it is difficult to accept that both mutants possess the same effects on the UPR. Furthermore, contrary to these observations, neither loss of PS1 and PS2 function nor expression of FAD-linked PS1 mutants were reported to have a discernable impact on the UPR. Therefore, re-examination and detailed analyses are needed to clarify the relationship between PS1 function and UPR signaling. Here, we report that PS1/PS2 null and dominant negative PS1 mutants, which are mutated at aspartate residue 257 or 385, did not affect signaling of the UPR. In contrast, FAD-linked PS1 mutants were confirmed to disturb UPR signaling by inhibiting activation of both Ire1α and ATF6, both of which are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducers in the UPR. Furthermore, PS1 mutants also disturbed activation of PERK (PKR-like ER kinase), which plays a crucial role in inhibiting translation during ER stress. Taken together, these observations suggested that PS1 mutations could affect signaling pathways controlled by each of the respective ER-stress transducers, possibly through a gain-of-function.

Although the mechanisms by which mutations in PS1 predispose individuals to FAD have not yet been determined, FAD-linked PS1 mutations have been shown to be associated with altered proteolytic processing of APP, such as increases in the production of the highly amyloidogenic Aβ peptide, Aβ42 (9Borchelt D.R.

Aβ production accompanied by the accumulation of carboxyl-terminal fragments of APP, which are generated by cleavage of β- and γ-secretases for APP, was inhibited in PS1-deficient cells (11De Strooper B.

This finding indicated that PS1 is important in the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage process involved in generating Aβ. Mutations in PS1 increase cellular susceptibility to apoptosis induced by various insults, including the withdrawal of trophic factors and exposure to Aβ (12Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G.

Med. 1999; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that the mechanism by which PS1 mutations promote cell death could contribute to increasing vulnerability to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by altering the signaling pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (14Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The accumulation of misfolded polypeptides in the lumen of the ER results in activation of the UPR, inducing transcriptional up-regulation of genes encoding molecular chaperones and folding catalysts present in the ER (15Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). One of the mediators of the UPR is a transducer of ER stress, the ER-resident transmembrane kinase Ire1 (16Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar,17Wang X-Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Ire1 senses the perturbed environment in the ER and leads to downstream signaling by a process that is thought to depend on oligomerization and autophosphorylation of its kinase domain. The down-regulation of UPR signaling by PS1 mutations is caused by disruption of the function of Ire1, i.e. PS1 mutations decrease the levels of phosphorylated Ire1 (14Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Recently, Niwaet al. (18Niwa M. Sidrauski C. Kaufman R.J. Walter P. Cell. 1999; 99: 691-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) reported that PS1-deficient cells show a reduced ability to mount the UPR, with a reduction in nuclear accumulation of carboxyl-terminal fragments of Ire1. They speculated that impairment of the UPR is based on a defect in UPR-induced proteolytic processing of Ire1 at its intramembranous region by defects of γ-cleaving activities associated with PS1. Contrary to these observations, Satoet al. (19Sato N. Urano F. Yoon Leem Y.J. Kim S.H. Li M. Donoviel D. Bernstein A. Lee A.S. Ron D. Veselits M.L. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have reported that neither PS1 null nor FAD-linked mutations affect the UPR signaling. Therefore, a re-examination and detailed analyses of relationships between PS1 functions and the UPR should be performed. ATF6 is an ER transmembrane protein, recently isolated as a possible mammalian UPR-specific transcription factor (20Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 21Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). ATF6 is cleaved at or close to the cytosolic face of the membrane in response to ER stress. The amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which contains the DNA-binding, dimerization, and transactivation domains, is translocated into the nucleus and activates transcription of ER molecular chaperone genes containing the ER stress response element (ERSE) (20Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 23Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which is thought to be a regulatory element of promoter regions conserved in ER molecular chaperone genes in mammalian cells. However, it has not been determined whether the luminal domain of ATF6 can itself sense the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER or whether cleavage of ATF6 requires ER stress-dependent activation of Ire1 proteins. If PS1 null or FAD-linked mutations affect the induction of ER molecular chaperones as described previously, these mutations could disturb the function of ATF6 as well as Ire1. In the present study, to make it clear whether PS1 is associated with UPR signaling, we re-examined the effects of PS1 on induction of BiP/GRP78 mRNA and the ER stress response using PS1-deficient cells and cell lines expressing dominant negative PS1 mutants, with mutations of aspartate residues located in transmembrane domains 6 and 7 of PS1 (24Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar), and expressing FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Furthermore, to clarify the mechanisms by which mutant PS1 down-regulates signaling of the UPR, we examined whether PS1 mutants affected the signaling pathways mediated by other ER stress transducers such as ATF6 or PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), which is an ER stress transducer and may play a role in inhibiting translation during ER stress (25Harding H.P.

Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, respectively. Two days before the stimulation by various ER stressors, 3 × 105 cells were plated in 10-cm-diameter dishes (for Western and Northern blotting analyses) or 1 × 105 cells in 6-cm-diameter dishes (for cell death assay), with the media changed for fresh ones the next day. In all experiments of ER stress response, we used only culture dishes that were grown at 70–80% confluence to avoid various stresses induced by overgrowth. On the day of stimulation, cells were placed in fresh media for more than 1 h before treatment with ER stressors to create the same conditions in each dish. We used tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and DTT (all from Sigma) as ER stress inducers at indicated doses and times. The control dishes were treated by just changing the media. Before collecting, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in aliquots of 200 μl of Triton buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 17.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 mg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mg/ml pepstatin A) for detection of Ire1α and PERK. For detection of ATF6, the cells were lysed in equal volumes of hot-SDS buffer (0.9% SDS, 15 mm EDTA, 8 mm methionine, and 1,000 units of Trasylol were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled, diluted to 0.3% SDS, and adjusted to contain 33 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.5, and 1.7% Triton X-100). All samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min after standing on ice for 1 h, and then the supernatants were collected in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Rabbit antisera against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1–14 of human PS1 have been described previously (14Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Anti-PERK antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues of mouse PERK (residues 1094–1114) and was affinity-purified by ProtOn Kit1 (Multiple Peptide System, San Diego). Anti-ATF6 antibodies against recombinant ATF6 (amino acids 6–307) fused to Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein have also been described previously (21Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Anti-Ire1α antibodies were provided by Prof. D. Ron (New York University School of Medicine). Anti-phosphorylated eIF2α polyclonal and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Research Genetics Co. and Chemicon International Inc., respectively. Wild-type, A246E, and ΔE9 PS1 cDNAs were cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (14Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells or mouse Neuro 2a cells were transfected with each expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and each stable transformant was established by selection with G418. Dominant negative PS1 mutants, which were mutated at aspartate residue 257 (D257A) or 385 (D385A), were cloned into pCDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen) atEcoRI sites. For Western blotting of Ire1α and PERK, cells were lysed in 1% Triton lysis buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For Western blotting of ATF6, cells were lysed in Laemmli SDS sample buffer and then loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein concentration of each sample was quantified by Lowry assay (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad). Protein-equivalent samples were subjected to Western blotting. As an internal control, the levels of β-actin were examined on the same blot at the same time as the other proteins of interest. Total RNA was extracted from cells treated with ER stress inducers. Aliquots of 10 μg of each total RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis through 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred onto Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled human BiP cDNA probe. After washing in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, the membranes were dried and autoradiographed. The human BiP cDNA was a gift from Dr. S. Kaneda (Heat Shock Protein Research Institute). Fibroblasts from PS1 mutant knock-in mice or SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with each PS1 construct were incubated with or without 3 μg/ml Tm for the specified times. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100. Anti-ATF6 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Stained cells were viewed with a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss). To estimate the relative nuclear fluorescence intensity, cells were co-stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to demarcate the nuclear boundaries. Then, cytoplasmic (C), nuclear (N), or both (N/C) types of staining of ATF6 were measured independently in 10 fields. Each value was represented by the percentage of positive cells in each fraction, and the total of C, N, and N/C was 100%. Mice lacking functional expression of PS1 were generated using homologous recombination to introduce a neomycin cassette flanked by loxP sequences ∼200 base pairs downstream of exon 5 of the murine PS1 gene. When theloxP flanked neomycin cassette is not removed bycre recombinase, the presence of cryptic splice sites within the neomycin cassette results in the generation of extremely low quantities of unstable transcripts lacking an open reading frame after exon 5. 2R. Rozmahel, P. Fraser, and P. St. George-Hyslop, manuscript in preparation. These transcripts result in no detectable PS1 protein expression in embryonic stem cells or in the brains of animals homozygous for this construct. As expected, homozygous PS1-deficient mice (PS1−/−) displayed the previously reported skeletal abnormalities (27Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S.

Primary fibroblasts were cultured from PS1+/−and PS1−/− embryos on embryonic day 14.5. Fibroblast cultures were also prepared from fetal mice at embryonic day 14.5, generated by mating heterozygous PS1 mutation (I213T) knock-in mice as described (30Nakano Y. Kondoh G. Kudo T.

These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and were treated with 2–3 μg/ml Tm for the specified times. For evaluation of cell death, lactate dehydrogenase levels in culture medium were quantified as described previously (14Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat.

Kaufman R.J. Walter P. Cell. 1999; 99: 691-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), suggesting that native PS1 is involved in UPR signaling. We re-examined the induction of BiP mRNA in PS1−/−, PS1/PS2−/− fibroblasts, and SK-N-SH cell lines expressing PS1 dominant negative mutants (D257A and D385A). The cells were stimulated with 3 μg/ml tunicamycin (Tm), which induces ER stress by preventing protein glycosylation, for specified times. Northern blotting showed that there was no difference in the induction of BiP mRNA between PS1−/− and PS1+/− fibroblasts, PS1/PS2−/− and PS1/PS2+/+ fibroblasts, or SK-N-SH cells expressing wild-type PS1 and dominant negative mutants (Fig.1). No effects of these mutations on the induction of BiP mRNA were confirmed at concentrations from 0.5 to 10 μg/ml of Tm. In contrast, fibroblasts from FAD-linked PS1 mutant knock-in mice, which express the PS1 mutant (I213T) at normal physiological levels (30Nakano Y. Kondoh G. Kudo T. Imaizumi K. Kato M. Miyazaki J.I. Tohyama M Takeda J. Takeda M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2577-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and SK-N-SH cells expressing PS1 mutant (delta exon 9, PS1Δ9) revealed that the induction of BiP mRNA was delayed and attenuated compared with wild-type cells at each dose from 0.5 to 3 μg/ml Tm (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we examined the changes in induction of CHOP, which is also induced during ER stress (31Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 32Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). We detected no differences in the induction of CHOP mRNA in PS1−/− fibroblasts (Fig. 1) or aspartate mutant-expressing neuroblastomas (data not shown). Cells expressing FAD-linked PS1 mutants exhibited a delay in CHOP mRNA induction similar to that in BiP mRNA induction (Fig.2). The effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutations on the induction of BiP and CHOP mRNA were observed at each dose of Tm from 0.5 to 5 μg/ml, but they could not be detected at 10 μg/ml because of the toxic effects of Tm, suggesting that higher doses of ER stress inducers could mask the down-regulation of UPR induced by PS1 mutation. Down-regulation of BiP mRNA induction by FAD-linked PS1 mutation was also observed in treatments with thapsigargin (TG) and dithiothreitol (DTT) (data not shown). These results indicated that although native PS1 is not involved in UPR signaling, FAD-linked PS1 mutants do have an effect that may be attributable to a gain of aberrant functions.Figure 2BiP mRNA in PS1 mutation knock-in or transfected cells. a, primary cultured fibroblasts from PS1 mutation (I213T) knock-in mice (wild and homozygous (Homo)). Time courses of the levels of BiP, CHOP, and β-actin mRNA after treatment with Tm are shown. b, SK-N-SH cells were stably transfected with each PS1 construct (Wild, wild-type; ΔE9, mutant deleted exon 9). Induction of BiP and/or CHOP mRNA was attenuated in homozygous fibroblasts and ΔE9-expressing SK-N-SH cells when cells were treated with 3 μg/ml Tm. These results were obtained for doses from 0.5 to 3 μg/ml Tm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We previously demonstrated that cells expressing PS1 mutants exhibited increased vulnerability to various ER stresses, the mechanism of which was the down-regulation of UPR signaling (14Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). If native PS1 is not relevant to UPR signaling, sensitivity to ER stress in PS1-deficient cells should be equivalent to that in wild-type cells. Therefore, we carried out cell death assays using various mutant cells treated with Tm. Cell death induced by Tm was significantly promoted in PS1 mutation knock-in fibroblasts and SK-N-SH cells expressing PS1Δ9 (Fig. 3 c), findings consistent with those observed previously. In contrast, PS1−/−fibroblasts and SK-N-SH cells expressing PS1 dominant negative mutants showed no differences in cell death induced by ER stress as compared with the respective controls (Fig. 3, a and b). Thus, we confirmed that a deficiency of PS1 does not affect susceptibility to ER stress and that native PS1 is not associated with UPR signaling. ATF6 is cleaved at or close to the cytosolic face of the membrane, and its amino-terminal portion is translocated into the nucleus during ER stress. The amino-terminal domain activates transcription of ER molecular chaperones such as BiP and GRP94 (20Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol.

We examined whether FAD-linked PS1 mutants also impaired activation of the other UPR transducer protein, ATF6, similarly to Ire1 as has been reported previously (14Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from PS1 mutant knock-in mice were stimulated by the addition of 2 μg/ml Tm. Cells were lysed, and Western blotting was performed using anti-ATF6 antibodies raised against the amino-terminal region of ATF6 (amino acids 6–307). ATF6 was constitutively expressed in wild-type fibroblasts as a 90-kDa protein (p90ATF6) (Fig.4 b). The p90ATF6 levels decreased, and instead a new band of 50-kDa (p50ATF6) appeared 2 h after treatment with Tm, with p50ATF6 gradually accumulating after this time. The homozygous fibroblasts from the PS1 mutant knock-in mice showed that the production of p50ATF6 was delayed and that the levels of the fragments were decreased by ∼50% compared with those from wild-type mice from 2 to 6 h after treatment with Tm (Fig.4 b). We also confirmed that the conversion of p90ATF6 to p50ATF6 was inhibited in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with FAD-linked PS1 mutants, such as PS1Δ9 or PS1 with an alanine-to-glutamate mutation (A246E) (Fig. 4 c). These findings indicated that PS1 mutations disturb the conversion of ATF6 under conditions of ER stress. In contrast, these effects on ATF6 were not observed in either PS1-deficient cells (Fig. 4 a) or in PS1 dominant negative-expressing cells (Fig. 4 c). Thus, native PS1 is not considered to play a role in the processing of ATF6 at or close to the cytosolic face of the ER membrane, findings that are likely to be different in the case of processing at the γ-site of APP. ATF6 has been reported to be constitutively expressed at the perinuclear region under non-ER stress conditions. ER stress causes the conversion of p90ATF6 to p50ATF6, which is translocated into the nucleus. We performed an immunocytochemical analysis of the subcellular localization of ATF6 in PS1 mutant cells under normal or ER stress conditions. For evaluation of ATF6 translocation, the fluorescence signals of cells stained with anti-ATF6 antibodies were divided into cytoplasmic (C), nuclear (N), or both regions (N/C). N/C shows that ATF6 was shifting from the ER to the nucleus (Fig.5 a). Under non-inducing conditions, the distribution of ATF6 (p90ATF6) in PS1 mutant knock-in cells resembled that seen in fibroblasts expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig. 5 b). p90ATF6 was localized predominantly in the ER, and a small fraction of cells (∼10%) showed nuclear staining. Nuclear immunoreactivity of ATF6, which has been demonstrated previously as p50ATF6 fragments (21Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar), increased in wild-type cells from 2 h after the induction of ER stress by treatment with Tm and reached a maximum within 4 h (Fig. 5, b andc). The changes in ATF6 immunoreactivity were consistent with the results of Western blotting. PS1 mutant knock-in cells showed slight nuclear accumulation of p50ATF6 2 h after induction (Fig.5, b and c). After 4 h, it gradually accumulated in the nucleus, and after 8 h, the immunoreactivity was almost equivalent to that in wild-type fibroblasts. Similar findings were obtained in SK-N-SH cells expressing PS1Δ9 (Fig.5 c). Thus, mutation in PS1 obviously delayed nuclear accumulation of p50ATF6, which could be ascribed to the delayed processing of p90ATF6 at the ER membrane (see Fig. 4 b). In PS1-deficient cells, subcellular localizat"

To characterize changes in lipid and lipoprotein gene expression in mouse liver, suppression subtractive hybridization and cDNA microarray analysis were used to identify mRNAs differentially expressed after leptin treatment of ob/ob mice. Ob/ob mice showed a profound decrease in mRNAs encoding genes controlling bile acid synthesis and transport as well as a variety of apolipoprotein genes and hepatic lipase with reversal upon leptin administration, suggesting that leptin coordinately regulates high density lipoprotein and bile salt metabolism. Leptin administration also resulted in decreased expression of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and urea synthesis, and increased expression of genes mediating fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and oxidant defenses. The changes in mRNA expression are consistent with a switch in energy metabolism from glucose utilization and fatty acid synthesis to fatty acid oxidation and increased respiration. The latter changes may produce oxidant stress, explaining the unexpected finding that leptin induces a battery of genes involved in antioxidant defenses. Expression cluster analysis revealed responses of several sets of genes that were kinetically linked. Thus, the mRNA levels of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis are rapidly (<1 h) repressed by leptin administration, in association with an acute decrease in plasma insulin levels and decreased sterol regulator element-binding protein-1 expression. In contrast, genes participating in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis were induced more slowly (24 h), following an increase in expression of their common regulatory factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. However, the regulation of genes involved in high density lipoprotein and bile salt metabolism shows complex kinetics and is likely to be mediated by novel transcription factors."

CXCR4 is also recognized by an antagonistic chemokine, the viral macrophage inflammatory protein II (vMIP-II) encoded by human herpesvirus type VIII. SDF-1α or vMIP-II binding to CXCR4 can inhibit HIV-1 entry via this co-receptor.

Based on the positions of two conserved cysteine residues in their N termini, chemokines can be divided into four subfamilies: CC, CXC, CX3C, and C (1Wells T.N.C. Power C.A. Lusti-Narasimhan M.

The stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1α)1 is one of the CXC chemokines, which plays critical roles in the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of leukocytes. SDF-1α is the only known natural ligand of CXCR4 receptor (3Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J.

Weiss R.A. Chang Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). vMIP-II acts as a selective chemoattractant for T helper 2 cells and monocytes and is an agonist for CCR8 (6Sozzani S.

The characterization of structural and functional determinants of CXCR4 for its ligand binding activity and HIV-1 co-receptor function is essential for understanding mechanisms of HIV-1 viral entry and developing novel therapeutic agents for HIV-1 infection. To this end, several studies have been carried out recently by a number of laboratories using chimeric chemokine receptors and mutants to demonstrate that multiple domains of CXCR4 are required for HIV-1 co-receptor activity (15Picard L.

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of CXCR4 was a determinant in SDF-1α binding and the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of CXCR4 was involved in receptor signaling (17Lu Z.

To better understand CXCR4 receptor and co-receptor functions, we have used an approach combining molecular modeling and experimental validation, similar to that developed by us and other groups in earlier studies of chemokine receptors interleukin-8 receptor β (24Luo Z. Butcher D. Huang Z. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CCR5 (25Zhou N. Luo Z. Hall J.W. Luo J. Han X. Huang Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), (26Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Price K. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), to propose plausible three-dimensional structural models of CXCR4 and its complex with SDF-1α or vMIP-II. These models rationalize the available data from chimeric and mutational experiments and provide a possible framework for understanding the structural basis of CXCR4 interactions with chemokine ligands and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. Furthermore, based on the molecular modeling results, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis studies on the N-terminal domain, the second extracellular loop (ECL2), and the third extracellular loop (ECL3) of CXCR4 to test specific structure-function hypotheses from our structural models. The chemokine ligand binding and HIV-1 membrane fusion studies of these designed CXCR4 mutants have provided valuable information about structure-activity relationships in the N-terminal domain and ECL2 of CXCR4 in chemokine binding and HIV-1 entry. Molecular modeling studies of the CXCR4·SDF-1α complex were carried out by using a procedure developed from our previous study of another chemokine receptor, CCR5 (25Zhou N. Luo Z. Hall J.W. Luo J. Han X. Huang Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations were performed by using the molecular modeling package of InsightII/Discover (Biosym Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA) on Silicon Graphics Indigo2 and Silicon Graphics Onyx workstations. The structural models of CXCR4 and its complex with SDF-1α were constructed in several steps. First, the assignment of transmembrane segments of CXCR4 was made based on the results published by others (27Pelchen-Matthews A. Signoret N. Klasse P.J. Fraile-Ramos A. Marsh M. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 168: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The structures of these CXCR4 segments were then generated by homology modeling based on the experimentally determined structure of the transmembrane core of bacteriorhodopsin (28Luecke H. Schobert B. Richter H.T. Cartailler J.P. Lanyi J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 29Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar). The structures of extracellular loops of CXCR4 were modeled by using the loop generation program of InsightII. The obtained structure of CXCR4 was energy-minimized, with two disulfide bridges Cys28–Cys274 and Cys109–Cys186 used as distance restraints (10Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). The dihedral angles of transmembrane regions were also constrained to maintain the original helical arrangement during energy minimization. To generate the complex of CXCR4 with SDF-1α, the crystal structure of SDF-1α (30Dealwis C. Fernandez E.J. Thompson D.A. Simon R.J. Siani M.A. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which is similar to the NMR structure (31Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), was manually placed on top of the extracellular domains of CXCR4, and the resulting structure was again energy-minimized. Finally, high temperature molecular dynamics simulation was performed for 200 ps to search the possible conformations of the receptor-ligand complex. Because the extracellular domains of CXCR4 are most likely the interface for ligand binding, the structure of the transmembrane helices of CXCR4 was fixed during the dynamics simulation. The conformation of SDF-1α (except its flexible N-terminal residues 1–7) was also constrained during the calculation to maintain its crystal structure. This facilitated a more efficient conformational searching of the complex. Because this study focused on the receptor-ligand interaction, the cytoplasmic domains of CXCR4, which are not involved in ligand binding and CXCR4 co-receptor function for HIV-1, were not included in the models. Employing a similar procedure described above, models for the CXCR4·vMIP-II complex were generated and analyzed using the crystal structure of vMIP-II (32Fernandez E.J. Wilken J. Thompson D.A. Peiper S.C. Lolis E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12837-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which is similar to the NMR structure (33Liwang A.C. Wang Z.X. Sun Y. Peiper S.C. Liwang P.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2270-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recombinant human chemokines SDF-1α and viral chemokine vMIP-II (R&D Systems Inc.) were lyophilized and dissolved as 1 or 2.5 μg/μl stock solutions in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at −20 °C in aliquots. They were diluted to appropriate concentrations immediately before use. The radioiodinated SDF-1α was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The specific activity of125I-SDF-1α was 2200 Ci/mmol. Cell culture media and G418 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Antibody 12G5 was purchased from PharMingen and 44708.111 from R&D Systems. Plasmid pCDNA-CXCR4, the human kidney cell line 293, and the murine 3T3-T4 cells were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Instituted of Health, Bethesda, MD). 293 and 3T3-T4 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding two envelopes of HIV-1, vSC60 (IIIB) and vBD3 (89.6), and vTF1.1 encoding T7 RNA polymerase were generous gifts from Dr. Robert W. Doms (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). All mutants of CXCR4 were prepared with the MORPH™ site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on CXCR4 in a pcDNA3 vector. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid constructs of CXCR4 wild-type and mutants were transfected into 293 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Twenty-four hours after transfection, selection for stable expression cells was initiated by the addition of G418 (800 μg/ml). Transfected cells were evaluated for expression level at the cell surface by flow cytometry, using antibodies 12G5 and 44708.111 to the second extracellular loop of CXCR4. The stably transfected cells were harvested in PBS (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free) plus 0.5 nm EDTA and washed twice with PBS. Ligand binding experiments were performed using a single concentration (0.2 nm) of 125I-SDF-1α in a final volume of 100 μl of binding buffer (50 nm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 nm CaCl2, 5 nmMgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 5 × 105 cells. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 100 nm unlabeled chemokines. Samples were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The incubation was terminated by separating the cells from the binding buffer by centrifugation and washing once with 500 μl of cold binding buffer. Bound ligands were determined by counting γ emissions. At least three independent experiments were performed. Sup T1 cells (2 × 105) were washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% sodium azide in PBS) and incubated with an anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12G5 (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with FACS buffer, cells were incubated with 10 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with FACS buffer, cells were fixed in the fixing buffer (2% paraformaldehyde in PBS), and then analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Coulter EPICS Elite, Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). For competition with SDF-1α and vMIP-II, cells were incubated with 12G5 and SDF-1α (50 nm) or vMIP-II (50 nm) at 4 °C for 40 min. After staining, cells were fixed for FACS analysis. For detection of CXCR4 internalization, cells were first incubated with SDF-1α (50 nm) at 37 °C for 40 min, and then washed once with acidic glycine buffer (pH 3.5), and twice with FACS buffer (34Samanta A.K. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After staining, cells were analyzed by FACS. A gene reporter fusion assay was used to determine the co-receptor activity of wild-type and mutant CXCR4 in mediating HIV-1 viral entry following a modified procedure published by others (35Doranz B.J.

HIV-1 Env proteins and T7 RNA polymerase were introduced into effector 293 cells by infection with recombinant vaccinia virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 2 h. Infected cells were then trypsinized, washed with PBS, resuspended in medium, and incubated overnight at 32 °C in the presence of rifampicin (100 μg/ml). 3T3-T4 target cells expressing CD4 were co-transfected in six-well plates with plasmids encoding CXCR4 wild-type or mutants and luciferase under control of T7 promotor, using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method. Four to 6 h after transfection, cells were lifted, washed with PBS, seeded in 24-well plates, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. To initiate fusion, 105 effector cells were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of ara-C and rifampicin. After 5 h of fusion, cells were lysed in 150 μl of reporter lysis buffer (PharMingen) and assayed for luciferase activity by using commercially available reagents (PharMingen). Following a modified procedure published by others (38Heveker N. Montes M. Germeroth L. Amara A. Trautmann A. Alizon M. Schneider-Mergener J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 39Donnadieu E. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), untransduced 293 cells and CXCR4 or its mutants stably transfected 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were detached with 0.1% EDTA and washed twice with PBS. For Ca2+ mobilization studies, 5 × 106/ml cells were loaded with the fluorescent dye, fura-2 (2 μm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Hank's balanced salt solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose, and 0.025% bovine serum albumin), for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times and resuspended at a concentration of 30–40 × 106/ml, and then 1.5–2 × 106 cells were tested in the same buffer. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was measured using excitation at 340 and 380 nm on a fluorescence spectrometer (LS50B, PerkinElmer, Beaconsfield, England) upon the stimulation with SDF-1α. Calibration was performed using 10% Triton X-100 for total fluorophore release and 0.5 m EGTA to chelate free Ca2+. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using a fluorescence spectrometer measurement program. A model of the CXCR4·SDF-1α complex (Fig.1 A) was built by using a procedure similar to that used in our previous studies of CXCR2 (24Luo Z. Butcher D. Huang Z. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CCR5 (25Zhou N. Luo Z. Hall J.W. Luo J. Han X. Huang Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Various structures extracted from the molecular dynamics simulation were subjected to further analysis. At first, all structures were minimized and the interaction energy between CXCR4 and SDF-1α was calculated. The averaged interaction energy of various structures is −371 kcal/mol and the standard deviation 13 kcal/mol. Among these structures, the conformation extracted from simulation time 130 ps had the lowest (most favorable) interaction energy of −405 kcal/mol, which compared favorably to −401 kcal/mol for the second lowest energy conformer and −371 kcal/mol for the averaged interaction energy (Fig.2 A). Therefore, we performed further analysis on this conformation. The single residue contribution in CXCR4 to bind SDF-1α was calculated. Along the CXCR4 peptide chain, we found that the N terminus, ECL2, and ECL3 had the most contribution to the receptor-ligand interactions (Fig. 2 B). Table I lists the residues on CXCR4 with the most contributions to these interactions among all the amino acid residues analyzed. Similarly, the structures of CXCR4·vMIP-II complex were also generated and a representative model is shown in Fig.1 B. We note that a structural model for CXCR4 has been shown previously by Chabot et al. (40Chabot D.J. Chen H. Dimitrov D.S. Broder C.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because the structural details of the model by Chabot et al. are not available, we are unable to compare their model with ours.Figure 2A, interaction energy between CXCR4 and SDF-1α for various structures. A series of structures were extracted from the 200-ps molecular dynamics simulation. These structures were energy-minimized, and the interaction energy between CXCR4 and SDF-1α for each minimized structure calculated and shown in the figure. The lowest energy conformer extracted from simulation time 130 ps has the lowest (most favorable) interaction energy of −405 kcal/mol between CXCR4 and SDF-1α and is highlighted in the figure.B, contribution of single amino acid residue on CXCR4 to ligand binding. The structure is selected at simulation time 130 ps, which has the lowest interaction energy. The interaction energy between every amino acid residue in the receptor (CXCR4) and the entire molecule of ligand (SDF-1α) was calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IPotential ligand interaction sites on CXCR4 as predicted from structural analysis of the receptor-ligand complexN terminusGlu2, Ser5, Tyr7, Thr13, Ser18, Gly19, Asp20, Tyr21, Ser23, Glu26ECL2Arg183, Tyr184, Asp187, Arg188, Phe189, Tyr190, Pro191, Trp195, Gln200ECL3Leu267, Glu268, Ile270, Gln272, Gly273, Thr279 Open table in a new tab Based on the information of structural modeling and receptor-ligand binding energy, 12 residues at the N-terminal domain, ECL2, and ECL3 were selected for further site-directed mutagenesis studies. All of selected residues were individually substituted by alanine. The mutant constructs were transiently or stably transfected into 293 cells. Analysis of cell surface expression by flow cytometry using antibodies 12G5 and 44708.111 against CXCR4 indicated that most of CXCR4 mutants displayed an expression level comparable with wild-type CXCR4, but two constructs, W195A and Q200A, had extremely poor expression on the cell surface and were not included in further experiments (Fig.3). All of the mutants with expression levels comparable with wild-type CXCR4 were further assayed for ligand binding activity. 293 cells, stably transfected with wild-type and mutant CXCR4, were tested for competition binding with125I-labeled SDF-1α in the presence of unlabeled SDF-1α and vMIP-II. As shown as Fig.4 A, the three mutants R183A, Y184A, and Y190A in ECL2 had no effect on SDF-1α and vMIP-II binding, whereas the mutations Y7A, D20A, and Y21A in the N-terminal domain showed 80%, less than 50%, and less than 10% binding activities, respectively, with both SDF-1α and vMIP-II compared with wild-type CXCR4. Another mutation, E268A in the ECL3, retained only 50% binding activity. The monoclonal antibody 12G5, which recognizes an epitope in ECL2 (16Brelot A. Heveker N. Pleskoff O. Sol N. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,41Brelot A. Heveker N. Adema K. Hosie M.J. Willett B. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can competitively bind to CXCR4 with SDF-1α and vMIP-II and block HIV-1 entry supported by the CXCR4 co-receptor (42Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). 293 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant CXCR4 were incubated with mAb 12G5 (10 μg/ml) in the presence of 100 nm SDF-1α or vMIP-II. The results (Fig. 4 B) obtained by FACS analysis were very similar to that of 125I-labeled SDF-1α binding experiments (Fig. 4 A). Nevertheless, the ability of SDF-1α to compete with 12G5 was weaker than that of vMIP-II. The mutants Y7A, D20A, and Y21A in N-terminal domain and E268A in ECL3 showed a significant reduction of inhibition of 12G5 binding to CXCR4. To determine the effects of CXCR4 mutations on signal transduction in response to SDF-1α, we measured intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in stably transfected 293 cells upon stimulation with 50 nmSDF-1α. We found that mutant Y21A in the N-terminal domain and E268A in ECL3, which exhibited lower ligand binding activity, were impaired in signaling mediated by SDF-1α (Fig.5 A). A low intensity Ca2+ response was observed for mutants Y190A in the ECL2, although this mutant maintained binding activity comparable with wild-type CXCR4. Other CXCR4 mutants display signaling activity corresponding to their binding activity for SDF-1α. The effect of CXCR4 mutation on SDF-1α signaling is dose dependent as shown by experiments of two representative CXCR4 mutants S5A and Y21A together with wild-type CXCR4 as a control (Fig. 5 B). The chemokine receptor CXCR4 can be induced to undergo rapid internalization by the ligand, SDF-1α (42Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.-L.

In bacteria, the RecA protein promotes hybrid DNA formation during recombination (1Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5355-5358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kowalczykowski S.C.

Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RecA binds and coats ssDNA1 to form a helical nucleoprotein filament. This filament binds dsDNA to search for regions homologous to the ssDNA contained within the filament. During the search for homology, the dsDNA adopts an underwound and extended conformation, creating unstacked base pairs that can be tested for homology. RecA then catalyzes strand exchange, a reaction in which the ssDNA contained within the filament displaces the identical strand in the dsDNA and forms Watson-Crick base pairs with its complement. Functions of RecA have been conserved in bacteriophage, prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes (4Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem.

Rad51 is important for both mitotic and meiotic recombination whereas Dmc1 expression and function are meiosis-specific. Additional relatives of Rad51 have been identified in yeast and vertebrates (reviewed in Ref.11Gasior S.L. Olivares H. Ear U. Hari D.M. Weichselbaum R. Bishop D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although a complex containing two of the five vertebrate Rad51 paralogues has been shown to function together to promote homologous strand assimilation (12Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K.

Despite this partial redundancy of function, Rad51 and Dmc1 have unique functions during recombination that cooperate during a large fraction of recombination events (16Schwacha A. Kleckner N.

Evidence for direct interaction between Dmc1 and Rad51 has been reported for the human but not the yeast orthologues (20Tarsounas M. Morita T. Pearlman R.E. Moens P.B. J.

Like RecA, Rad51 from human and yeast has been shown to catalyze homologous pairing and perform strand exchange activity (11Gasior S.L. Olivares H. Ear U. Hari D.M. Weichselbaum R. Bishop D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8411-8418Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 24Baumann P. Benson F.E.

Its activity is stimulated by accessory factors, including the single-strand DNA binding protein RPA (replication protein A) and proteins encoded by members of the RAD52 epistasis group (11Gasior S.L.

Rad51 forms helical nucleoprotein filaments in which the DNA is in an underwound and extended conformation relative to the B form, indicating that the structural framework underlying the strand invasion process is conserved between Escherichia coli and eukaryotes (26Ogawa T., Yu, X.

A. 2001; 98: 8433-8439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although the activity reported is less robust than that of Rad51. The HsDmc1 protein has been shown to form toroidal octomers that can bind DNA as a stack of rings on the DNA (22Masson J.Y. Davies A.A. Hajibagheri N. Van Dyck E. Benson F.E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A.

Discovery of the toroidal form of Dmc1 raises the possibility that the functional form of Dmc1 differs from that of other members of the RecA family. Direct evidence supporting this possibility has yet to be obtained. In addition to promoting homology-mediated invasion of duplex, RecA is able to renature complementary ssDNA strands, an activity that may contribute to some types of recombination (31Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Renaturation activity has also been reported for HsRad51 (32Gupta R.C. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Furthermore, yeast Rad52 also promotes renaturation, and this activity may be responsible for Rad51-independent recombination events in mitotic cells (33Rattray A.J. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1994; 138: 587-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ivanov E.L. Sugawara N. Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1996; 142: 693-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mortensen U.H.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the purification of Dmc1 protein from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and biochemical characterization of its function. Like RecA, Rad51, and HsDmc1, ScDmc1 binds both ssDNA and dsDNA and has DNA-dependent ATPase activity. We show for the first time that Dmc1 promotes renaturation of complementary ssDNA and does so with first order reaction kinetics like RecA. We also show that ScDmc1 can promote homologous ssDNA strand assimilation in duplex DNA. To determine if the Dmc1 protein remains functional in S. cerevisiae when modified by the addition of 6 histidine codons at the amino terminus, an HIS6 -DMC1 allele was constructed. This allele was inserted at the normal DMC1locus by one-step transplacement. The KanMX4 gene was located 643 bp 3′ of the transcriptional stop codon, conferring resistance to the antibiotic G418 (Sigma Chemical Co.). The HIS6 -DMC1::KanMX4construct was transformed into the haploid strain DKB1586 (MATa; dmc1Δ::ARG4) to create strain DKB1589. As a control, a DMC1::KanMX4 construct (i.e.an unmodified copy of DMC1) was also transplaced into DKB1586 to create strain DKB1687. Proper integrants were detected by screening transformants for loss of arginine prototrophy. Integration into the correct position was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The HIS6 -DMC1::KanMX4and DMC1::KanMX4 strains were mated with DKB760 (MATα;dmc1Δ::ARG4) to create diploid strains DKB1688 (dmc1Δ::ARG4/HIS6 -DMC1::KanMX4)and DKB1689 (dmc1Δ::ARG4/ DMC1::KanMX4). Both diploids were assayed for sporulation efficiency, spore viability, and frequency of interhomologue recombination by previously published methods (10Bishop D.K. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1992; 69: 439-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). An intronless derivative of DMC1 was modified to encode an additional 6 histidine residues at the amino terminus and placed under the control of a phage T7 promoter (pET3a, Novagen) to create pNRB150. This plasmid was chemically transformed into BLR(DE3)/pLysS E. coli cells (Novagen), which carry a null mutation in the recA gene. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the cells reached A540 = 0.3. Expression of Dmc1 was induced by the addition of 1.0 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside followed by a 1.5-h incubation at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, resuspended in equal volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm BME), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cells were rapidly thawed and kept at 4 °C for the remainder of the purification. The thawed cells were sonicated four times on a Cole-Parmer ultrasonic homogenizer (Chicago, IL) for 30 s each at 30% duty cycle and output of 3 in the presence of protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 ng/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc SC). Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation for 45 min at 25,000 rpm in a Beckman 70 Ti rotor. The cleared lysate was incubated with Talon resin (CLONTECH) that had been equilibrated in buffer A. The resin was washed with TP buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm BME). The protein-bound resin was then incubated with TP buffer containing 0.36 unit/μl of DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 2 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors. The resin was washed with TP buffer and then with 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.9, in TP buffer. Dmc1 was eluted with 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.9, in TP buffer. Protein eluted from the Talon resin was applied to Cibacron Blue (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with TP buffer. The column was washed with 200 mm NaCl in buffer G (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm BME). Dmc1 was eluted with 1.0 m NaCl in buffer G. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 200 mm NaCl in buffer G. The dialyzed fraction was then applied to Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer G with 200 mm NaCl. Dmc1 was eluted from the column with steps of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 m NaCl in buffer G. Protein fractions from the 0.5 and 0.7 m NaCl elution were combined and concentrated by dialysis into storage buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50% glycerol, 0.7 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm BME). Aliquots were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The yield from 8.0 liters of cells was ∼800 μg of Dmc1 protein. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and by spectrophotometric analysis at 280 nm (Dmc1 has an extinction coefficient of 12240 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm). The plasmids pBluescript II SK (+), pUC18, and pNRB252 used for biochemical assays were purified without DNA denaturation from log phase cultures of E. coli by lysozyme/Triton lysis followed by centrifugation in a cesium chloride/ethidium bromide density gradient (37Kolodner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4847-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Plasmid pNRB252 was constructed by inserting the 429-bp EcoRV-BsrBI fragment from pRS306 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the HincII site of piAN7 (39Huang H.V. Little P.F. Seed B. Bio/Technology. 1988; 10: 269-283PubMed Google Scholar). Oligo 18.1 is homologous to base pairs 400–455 of pUC18 (40Hsieh P. Camerini-Otero C.S. Camerini-Otero R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6492-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and oligo 306.7 is homologous to base pairs 165–220 of the 429-bp EcoRV-BsrBI fragment. For ATPase assays, the viral strand of M13 was propagated in E. coli strain JM101 and prepared according to published methods (41Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar). For DNA binding assays, replicative form I ΦX 174 DNA (New England BioLabs) was linearized with BsrBI followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (New England BioLabs). The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol and ethanol-precipitated. The ΦX 174 viral strand was linearized by hybridizing oligos to create a PstI site and a BsrBI site. The reaction mixture was run on an agarose gel. The band was excised and purified using the Geneclean kit (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). For DNA renaturation assays, pBluescript II SK (+) was linearized with AccI followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol and ethanol-precipitated. All DNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) using a protocol provided by the supplier. Radiolabeled DNA was purified from unincorporated nucleotide using a G25 MicroSpin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the specific activity was adjusted to roughly 2.5 × 1010 cpm/μmol by addition of unlabeled DNA. Concentrations of nucleic acids are given in moles of nucleotide for ssDNA or moles of base pairs for dsDNA. Reactions (10 μl) contained circular single-stranded M13 (0.3 mm nucleotide) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmmagnesium acetate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm [α-32P]ATP. The turnover rate was determined by calculating the Vmax based on a 50-fold range of ATP concentration. Reactions were started by the addition of the appropriate amount of Dmc1 and incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated time points, 1.0-μl aliquots were taken and spotted onto thin layer chromatography plates (CEL300 PEI, Machery-Nagel). The plates were developed in 850 mm potassium phosphate, pH 3.4, dried, analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and quantified using ImageQuant version 4.0 (Molecular Dynamics). Reactions (15 μl) contained either 1.3 μm32P-labeled linear dsΦX 174 or 2.6 μm32P-labeled linear ssΦX 174, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmmagnesium acetate, and 2 mm ATP. Reactions were started by the addition of the appropriate amount of Dmc1 and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Reaction were analyzed by electrophoresis on an 0.8% agarose gels for 1 h at 10 V/cm using 1× Tris acetate-EDTA (TAE) running buffer containing Tris-HCl reduced to 10 mm. The gel was dried onto Whatman paper and developed on Kodak BioMax MS film. 32P-Labeled heat-denatured linear pBluescript II SK (+) at various concentrations was incubated with Dmc1 in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm nucleotide cofactor. Aliquots of 25 μl were removed at appropriate time points and treated with 0.1% SDS at 37 °C for 10 min. Following addition of SDS, samples were kept at 4 °C while additional time points were taken. The samples were resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer for 1 h at 10 V/cm. The gels were dried on Whatman paper and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Dmc1 (0.54 μm) was preincubated with either 32P-labeled oligo 18.1, 306.7, or both (1.0 μm each) as in the DNA binding assays. Following preincubation, a mixture of pUC18 (12.3 μm) and pNRB252 (6 μm) was added along with sufficient magnesium acetate to give a final concentration of 10 mm. Oligos were in 5-fold molar excess to dsDNA target sequence. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 0.08%. DNA from reaction mixtures was resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer for 14–16 h at 2.2 V/cm. Gels were dried onto Whatman paper and analyzed by phosphorimaging. To aid in purification, the full-length coding region of DMC1 was tagged with His6. To ensure that the addition of 6 histidine residues to the amino terminus did not disrupt Dmc1 function, a strain was constructed that expressed only the His6-tagged Dmc1 protein. This strain was assayed for sporulation efficiency, spore viability, and the ability to generate recombinant products. The strain expressing His6-Dmc1 was indistinguishable from the wild type control in all three assays (TableI). These data indicate that the His6-Dmc1 protein is fully functional in vivo.Table IComplementation of His6-tagged Dmc1StrainSporulation efficiencyaSporulation efficiency was measured by phase contrast microscopy following sporulation on SPM + 1/5 COM plates.

Open table in a new tab His6-tagged Dmc1 was cloned into the phage T7 expression vector pET3a. The protein was expressed and purified from an E. coli strain that allowed inducible expression of the T7 RNA polymerase and carried a null allele of the recA gene to avoid potential contamination of Dmc1 preparations with RecA. Dmc1 was purified to near homogeneity by three chromatographic steps (see “Experimental Procedures”). A Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel of the purified protein shows a single prominent band (Fig. 1 A). Although there are species of smaller molecular weight detected in the lysate by Western blot, these did not bind to the Talon resin and the final fraction contains little or none of these species as assayed by Western blot (Fig. 1 B). Dmc1 contains Walker A and B amino acid sequence motifs, which are present in many proteins that bind ATP (42Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). Like other members of the RecA family, the ability of Dmc1 to hydrolyze ATP to ADP and Piis stimulated in the presence of either ssDNA or dsDNA (Fig. 2). The presence of dsDNA only stimulates the ATPase activity of Dmc1 to half the activity level stimulated by ssDNA. Omission of DNA results in 13% relative to the maximal ATPase activity. The lower ATPase activity in the presence of dsDNA as compared with ssDNA is unlikely to be due to lack of binding of Dmc1 to DNA, because all the Dmc1 should be bound to the DNA under the reaction conditions employed (see below). The ATP turnover rate (kcat) was calculated by generation of Lineweaver-Burk plots. In two independent experiments, the kcat was calculated to be 0.6 min−1and 0.8 min−1, giving an average of 0.7 min−1. Although this is lower than the turnover rate for RecA (kcat = 30 min−1), it is similar to the kcat of human and yeast Rad51 (kcat = 0.16 min−1 and 0.7 min−1, respectively) (23Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 24Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and human Dmc1 (kcat = 1.5 min−1 and 0.7 min−1) (28Li Z. Golub E.I. Gupta R. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11221-11226Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 29Gupta R.C. Golub E. Bi B. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8433-8439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ATPase assays indicate that Dmc1 interacts with DNA. The ability of Dmc1 to stably bind ssDNA and dsDNA was assayed directly by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Dmc1 was able to bind both ssDNA and dsDNA forming complexes that were stable enough to survive electrophoresis in agarose gels without cross-linking (Fig. 3). Incubation of ssDNA (2.6 μm nucleotide) in the presence of ATP showed that below 0.126 μm Dmc1 there was little shifting of DNA, although the mobility of a minor fraction of DNA was slightly shifted. Increasing the concentration of Dmc1 from 0.126 to 0.28 μm resulted in a discrete shift in the mobility of linear ssΦX 174. The lowest concentration at which the shift was observed corresponds to a molar ratio of 1 monomer per 9 nucleotides. Further increasing the Dmc1 concentration resulted in a gradual increase in the mobility of the ssDNA to a plateau that corresponds to a monomer per nucleotide ratio of 1:2 to 1:3. Binding to ssDNA was not substantially altered when nucleotide cofactor was omitted from reactions (data not shown). Dmc1 did not result in an electrophoretic mobility shift of dsDNA at concentrations below 0.28 μm. A small fraction of the DNA was retarded after incubation with 0.28 μm DNA, whereas a discrete shift of all DNA was observed at 0.42 μm, which corresponds to a monomer per base pair ratio of 1:6. The same shift in mobility of DNA was observed after binding to Dmc1 at concentrations ranging from 0.42 to 1.26 μm. However, a further 2-fold increase in Dmc1 concentration from 1.26 to 2.5 μmresulted in a further reduction in mobility of DNA. These data suggest that Dmc1 binds to dsDNA with slightly less affinity than to ssDNA. Consistent with this suggestion, binding to dsDNA was sensitive to slightly lower concentrations of NaCl than binding to ssDNA (data not shown). Unlike binding to ssDNA, binding to dsDNA required the presence of a nucleotide cofactor, such as ATP, dATP, ADP, or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue (data not shown). To determine if it is able to promote ssDNA renaturation, Dmc1 (0.35 μm) was incubated with 32P-labeled heat-denatured linear plasmid DNA (pBluescript II SK(+), 1.2 μm bp = 2.4 μm nucleotide). Spontaneous renaturation of the ssDNA was not detected during the time period examined (Fig. 4 A), but Dmc1-dependent renaturation activity is readily detected at 0.5 min (Fig. 4 B). Essentially all renatured products were in the form of linear duplex as opposed to high molecular weight networks. Such networks are the predominant product of RecA-promoted renaturation under most conditions (31Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 43McEntee K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4345-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 44Bryant F.R. Menge K.L. Nguyen T.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1062-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The results suggest that, under the conditions employed, the renatured products form without multiple independent “nucleation” events on a single molecule. Maximum Dmc1-dependent renaturation activity occurs at ratios of Dmc1 to nucleotides between 1:10 and 1:40. (Fig. 4 C). If saturation of ssDNA by Dmc1 occurs around 1 monomer to two to three nucleotides (as suggested by the EMSAs), optimal renaturation under these conditions occurs when less than 20% of the ssDNA is bound to protein. Both lower and higher levels of Dmc1 reduce the level of renaturation. To determine if the Dmc1-dependent renaturation reaction proceeds with first or second order kinetics, the ratio of Dmc1 to nucleotide was kept at 1:14 and the concentration of heat-denatured linear pBluescript was varied over a 100-fold range (0.011–1.1 nm plasmid molecules). A log-log plot of the half times of the renaturation reactions versus the initial concentration of heat-denatured DNA yields a straight line with a slope of −0.097 (Fig. 4 D). The log-log plot in the absence of nucleotide cofactor or in the presence of other nucleotide cofactors produced similar values (Fig. 4 D and data not shown). Because the slope of the plot did not differ significantly from 0, the results indicate that the Dmc1-dependent renaturation is a first order reaction, like RecA-dependent renaturation (44Bryant F.R. Menge K.L. Nguyen T.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1062-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 45Bryant F.R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A slope of −1 is expected if the reaction proceeds via second order kinetics as is the case for non-enzymatic renaturation. Under the conditions of our experiments the Dmc1-dependent renaturation reaction did not require ATP hydrolysis nor was the efficiency substantially dependent on added nucleotide. Although RecA-dependent renaturation is more efficient in the presence of ATP under some conditions, both RecA and Rad51 have also been found to promote renaturation in the absence of hydrolysis (32Gupta R.C.

Subsequently, DMEM containing 20% FBS (“medium B”) was added, and cells were cultured with or without 100 μmaspirin or 100 μmU46619. After 36 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and washed with PBS three times. The cells were then incubated with anti-PGIS antibody P4 for 2 h, and with anti-rabbit IgG-Texas Red for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS containing 2% FBS, stained with 0.3 mm Hoechst 33258 and observed under fluorescent microscopy. Total cellular extracts from the transfected cells were prepared by lysing cells in 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mmleupeptin. Protein from 1.0 × 104 cells was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Filters were blocked overnight with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% skim milk (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and 3% bovine serum albumin (Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C. Immunostaining steps were performed in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Filters were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h each.

BAEC were transfected using TransIT LT-1 (PanVera Co., Madison, WI). Transfections were performed in a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 3.0 μl of reagent, and cells were incubated in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 5 h. Subsequently, medium B or RPMI 1640 containing 20% FBS was added, and cells were grown for 12–72 h before analysis of apoptosis. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. 10 μl of a 0.5% solution of the dye was added to 100 μl of cell suspension (1.0 × 104cells/100 μl). The suspension was then applied to a hemacytometer, and both viable and nonviable cells were counted. A minimum of 300 cells was counted for each data point. A cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was performed to determine the apoptotic index by detecting nucleosome breakdown, the histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) generated by apoptotic cells. HEK-293 cells (8.0 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates) were plated in medium A and grown for 12 h. Cells were washed with PBS, transfected with PGISwt expression vector or mock vector, and cultured for 72 h. The cells were collected along with the floating cells and used to prepare the cytosol fractions. A volume of 10 μl of these cytosolic fractions were incubated in anti-histone antibody-coated wells (96-well plates), and the histones of the DNA fragments were detected by using 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzathiazoline sulfonate). The reaction products in each of the 96 wells were read using a Bio-Rad microplate reader (model 3550-UV). To assess DNA ladder formation, low molecular weight DNA was extracted from 1.8 × 106 cells (both floating and adherent) using ApoLadder EX kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Tokyo). The extracted DNA fragments were applied to a 1.5% agarose gel, separated electrophoretically, and visualized with ethidium bromide. Apoptotic cells were distinguished by their characteristic morphological changes such as membrane blebbing and cell body shrinkage. HEK-293, CV-1, or Caco-2 cells (2.0 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates) were plated with the respective serum-supplemented media and grown for 12 h. Cells were washed with PBS, cotransfected with 1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector, and 2.5 μg of PGISwt or PGISC441A expression vector and cultured for 5 h in serum-free medium. Subsequently, medium B was added and cells were grown for 60 h. The cells were stained with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-galactoside) solution (PBS containing 5 mm X-gal, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6-3H2O) at 37 °C for 3 h and scored for apoptotic cells. For measurement of effects of reagents on apoptosis, cells (2.0 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates) cotransfected with 1 μg of β-galactosidase and 2.5 μg of PGISwt or PGISC441A were cultured in serum-free medium containing several concentrations of iloprost, dbcAMP, H-7, or RpcAMP for 24 h at 37 °C, washed gently with PBS, and stained with X-gal. For analysis of effects of PPARδ on apoptosis, HEK-293 cells (8.0 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates) were cotransfected with 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector and 0.7 μg of expression vector for PPARδ or mutant PPARδ and PGISwt, PGISC441A, or mock vector using LipofectAMINE. The total amount of DNA was kept at 2 μg by the addition of control DNA (pCMV-7). After 24 h of transfection, cells were stained with X-gal and apoptosis was measured. The cells underwent apoptosis were indicated by a percentage of the total number of the blue cells stained by X-gal. A minimum of 300 cells was counted for each data point. Apoptosis was monitored with the ApoAlert caspase (CPP-32) assay kit using the (acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-l-aspartic acid α-(4-trifluoromethyl-coumacyl-7-amido)) substrate (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). HEK-293 cells (3.0 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were transfected with 22 μg of antisense or sense oligonucleotide for PPARδ using HVJ liposome (5Todaka T. Yokoyama C. Yanamoto H. Hashimoto N. Nagata I. Tsukahara T. Hara S. Hatae T. Morishita R. Aoki M. Ogihara T. Kaneda Y. Tanabe T. Stroke. 1999; 30: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, and cotransfected with 3 μg of expression vector for PGISwt, PGISC441A, or mock vector in the presence of additional 3 μg of antisense or sense oligonucleotide for PPARδ. After 36 h, CPP-32 activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions using (acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-l-aspart-1-al)-pretreated lysate as a control. Monolayers of HEK-293 cells in a 225-cm2 flask (3.0 × 106 cells) were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and suspended in 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μmpepstatin (buffer A), and sonicated three times at 150 watts for 5 s on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 1 h. Pellets were suspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer A containing 1% Tween 20, sonicated three times at 150 watts for 15 s on ice, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 1 h. The solubilized protein (800 μg) was incubated with protein G-Sepharose (150 μl) preincubated with control IgG for 2 h at 4 °C as a preclearing step. After pelleting the protein G-Sepharose, COX-1 polyclonal IgG or control IgG coupled to protein G-Sepharose was added to a half of resulting supernatant and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was then washed five times with 1 ml of the same buffer, mixed with 50 μl of sample buffer under nonreducing condition, heated for 5 min at 100 °C, subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto Immobilon-P as described above. Membrane was then subjected to immunoblotting analysis using COX-1 polyclonal antiserum. PGI2 production was determined in HEK-293 cells (1.0 × 106/100-mm dish) cotransfected with expression vector for PGISwt, PGISC441A, or mock vector with or without COX-1 or COX-2 vector. After 24 h of transfection, medium was removed and serum-free medium containing 0 or 10 μm arachidonic acid was added. After 48 h, incubation media were collected and stored at −20 °C before assay. Amounts of 6-keto-PGF1α were measured using an ELISA kit (Cayman Chemical Co.). For cAMP assay, HEK-293 or BAEC (2.0 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates) were washed once in serum-free DMEM, followed by incubation with several concentrations of iloprost or cPGI for 24 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by aspiration of the medium and addition of 2 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were cooled to 4 °C, cAMP was extracted with extraction buffer (65% ethanol containing 5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, Sigma), and lysates were cleared by spinning at 10,000 × g for 5 min and dried under vacuum. Samples were reconstituted in assay buffer, and cAMP was quantified using an ELISA kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Distribution of PGI2 analog, iloprost, in HEK-293 cells was measured using [3H]iloprost. HEK-293 cells (1.0 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were cultured in medium A containing 10 nm [3H]iloprost (0.05 μCi/ml) for 0–180 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in three volumes of homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.0 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1450 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used as the cytoplasm-containing fraction. Nuclei and plasma membranes were isolated from the resulting pellets. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer. The solution containing the resuspended pellet was adjusted to a final concentration of 1.6 m sucrose by addition of homogenization buffer with a high density sucrose solution. A two-layer step gradient was set up by layering 250 mm sucrose homogenization buffer over the 1.6 m sucrose suspension and centrifuged at 70,900 ×g for 60 min. The band at the gradient interface (250 mm and 1.6 m sucrose) was collected and used as the plasma membrane fraction. The pellet produced after the gradient centrifugation containing the nuclear fraction was collected and used for the nuclei fraction. The [3H]iloprost-derived radioactivity of each fraction or whole cells was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Oligonucleotides dS, 5′-AAGAGGAGGAGAAAGAGGA-3′ corresponding to the human PPARδ cDNA (32Schmidt A. Vogel R.L. Witherup K.M. Rutledge S.J. Pitzenberger S.M. Adam M. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) sense sequence (nucleotide residues 38–56); dAS, 5′-TCCTCTTTCTCCTCCTCTT-3′, the antisense sequence; aS, 5′-CTCGGTGACTTATCCTGTG-3′ corresponding to the human PPARα cDNA sense sequence (nucleotide residues 237–255); and the antisense sequence aAS, 5′-CACAGGATAAGTCACCGAG-3′, were synthesized. These oligonucleotides were transfected into cells using the HVJ liposome method (3Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Each oligonucleotide (22 μg) was mixed with a nuclear protein, high mobility group-1. HVJ liposomes were prepared by mixing dried lipids (phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol, 1:4.8:2, w/w/w) with UV light-inactivated HVJ virus. After an incubation and sucrose gradient centrifugation, the top layer was collected and used for transfection. After 48 h of transfection the cells were used for apoptosis assay and PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) reporter assay. The PPREx3-luciferase reporter vector, which contains three copies of PPRE for hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (33Juge-Aubry C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), was constructed by synthesis of the sense oligonucleotide, 5′-CGCGTAAAAACTGGGCCAAAGGTCTAAAAACTGGGCCAAAGGTCTAAAAACTGGGCCAAAGGTCTC-3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-TCGAGAGACCTTTGGCCCAGTTTTTAGACCTTTGGCCCAGTTTTTAGACCTTTGGCCCAGTTTTTA-3′. Both oligonucleotides were annealed and subcloned into theMluI-XhoI site of the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). BAEC (8.0 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates) were cotransfected with the 0.2 μg of PPREx3-luciferase reporter vector and 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector using TransIT LT-1. After 12 h of transfection, cells were washed with PBS, incubated in serum-free DMEM containing several concentrations of iloprost or cPGI for 24 h at 37 °C, and subjected to luciferase assay. HEK-293 cells (8.0 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates) treated with antisense or sense oligonucleotide were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of PPREx3-luciferase reporter vector, 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector, and 0.7 μg of expression vector for PGISwt, PGISC441A, or mock vector using LipofectAMINE. Nontreated HEK-293 cells (8.0 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates) were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of PPREx3-luciferase reporter vector and 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector with 0.7 μg of expression vector for PPARδ or mutant PPARδ and PGISwt, PGISC441A, or mock vector using LipofectAMINE. The total amount of DNA was kept at 2 μg by the addition of control DNA (pCMV-7). After another 24 h, the cells were harvested and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were quantified. The luciferase activity of the extract was normalized with β-galactosidase activity. The cDNA for PPARδ was isolated by PCR amplification. The poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from 2.0 × 106 cells of mouse vascular smooth muscle-derived SVS30 cells using a FastTrack 2.0 kit (Promega). The poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed by extension with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a specific antisense primer complementary to the sequence located in the 3′-region of the cDNA for PPARδ: 5′-TTAGTACATGTCCTTGTAGATTTC-3′; the reverse-transcribed cDNA was used for the following PCR amplification. The PPARδ cDNA was amplified using the primers Pdw5 (5′-GAAAGCTTGTCGACCCACCATGGAACAGCCACAG-3′) and Pdw3 (5′-GTCTAGAGGATCCTTAGTACATGTCCTTGTAGAT-3′). Pdw5 or Pdw3 has HindIII or BamHI restriction site (underlined, respectively). PCR was performed for 35 cycles with a temperature profile of 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C using KOD polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The amplification products were purified in 1% agarose gel using a Qiagen gel extraction kit. The isolated DNA was inserted into theHindIII-BamHI site of pBluescript II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems model 310 genetic analyzer. For construction of an expression vector for PPARδ, PCR-derived cDNA for PPARδ was excised from the pBluescript vector with HindIII and BamHI and religated into the pcDNAIII vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The PPARδL431A/G434A double mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type receptor. The oligonucleotide used in mutagenesis was Pdm3 (5′-GTACATGTCCTTGTAGATCGCCTGGAGCGCGGGGTGCAGC-3′), and the construct was verified by sequencing. Pdm3 has two mutated sites (underlined). The products were purified, subcloned into theHindIII-BamHI site of pBluescript II, and inserted into the HindIII-BamHI site of pcDNAIII vector. An expression vector encoding human PGIS (29Hatae T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Yabuki T. Inoue H. Ullrich V. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or control vector was transfected into HEK-293 cells, and cell viability was determined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, we observed a significant decrease in the viability of the cells transfected with the PGIS expression vector, whereas no change in viability was seen in the cells transfected with a mock vector. Moreover, transfection of the PGIS expression vector into HEK-293 cells resulted in significant morphological changes, including membrane blebbing and cell body shrinkage (Fig. 1 B, left panel), features typical of apoptosis (34Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). When the histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) in cytosol fractions of the cells were measured by ELISA, the amounts of DNA fragments in the cells transfected with the PGIS expression vector increased gradually after 36 h of transfection (Fig.1 C). However, cell morphology and contents of DNA fragments were not changed in cells transfected with the mock vector (Fig. 1,B and C). These data indicate that transfection with the PGIS expression vector causes a decline in cell viability and an increase in apoptotic cell death in HEK-293 cells. There is no detectable endogenous PGIS in HEK-293 cells (29Hatae T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Yabuki T. Inoue H. Ullrich V. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A significant amount of endogenous COX-1, which synthesizes PGH2, a substrate for PGIS, was detected in the HEK-293 cells by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 D), although it has been reported that expression of both COX-1 and -2 in the cells is undetectable by immunoblotting (35Murakami M.

The enzyme from Bacillus cereus569/H/9 (BcII)1 represents a member of subclass B1 with 3 His ligands in one site and 1 Asp, 1 Cys, and 1 His ligand in the other site (3H1 and DCH1 sites, respectively).

Although catalytic mechanisms for the enzyme with either one or two zinc ions bound have been discussed (for review see Ref. 7Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) the respective roles of the two binding sites during catalysis are still unclear. Generally the 3H site is considered to be the primary catalytic site. However, the importance of the DCH site for catalysis became obvious from studies of the C168A mutant. When only one zinc ion is bound to this mutant, it shows a very low activity compared with the wild type, whereas wild type-like activity is almost restored when a second metal ion is bound (5Paul Soto R. Bauer R. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H.F. Rossolini G.M. de Seny D. Hernandez Valladares M. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. J. Biol.

Perturbed angular correlation (PAC) of γ-ray spectroscopy provides information on the metal ion coordination geometry through measurement of the nuclear quadrupole interaction (NQI) between the nuclear electric quadrupole moment and the electric field gradient from the surrounding charge distribution. With this method it was possible to demonstrate that the Cd(II) ions in the mononuclear wild type BcII are distributed between the two metal binding sites (8Paul Soto R. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W.

In a recent investigation combining PAC with 113Cd-NMR spectroscopy, it was shown that the metal ions exchange between the two metal binding sites in a time regime of μs (9Hemmingsen L. Damblon C.

Extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy of zinc proteins is unique in the sense that a direct observation of the zinc ion is possible (a detailed description of the method can be found in Ref. 10Teo B.K. EXAFS: Basic Principles and Data Analysis. Springer, Berlin1986Crossref Google Scholar). In EXAFS spectroscopy the surroundings of a bound metal ion (absorber) are observed from the position of the metal ion, as in PAC and NMR spectroscopy. However, whereas the latter methods are sensitive to the angular position and the electrostatic properties of the ligands, the intensity of back-scattering depends mainly on the number of electrons in the back-scattering atom and the distance to the absorber. Defined patterns obtained from multiple scattering, including atoms more distant than the first coordination sphere, allow the identification of histidines as ligands (for a description of the method see Ref. 11Meneghini C.

For a given model, EXAFS spectroscopy predicts absorber-ligand distances with a precision unmatched by protein crystallographic measurements and thereby represents a method to refine the geometry of a known absorber site. To probe the role of all six protein ligands of the metal ions in BcII, we produced the following mutants: H86S, H88S, and H149S in the 3H site and D90N, C168S, and H210S in the DCH site. To study the effects on metal ion binding we prepared the metal-free enzymes and determined the affinities for zinc, cobalt, and cadmium. We used stopped-flow fluorescence measurements to study the kinetics of metal ion binding to the wild type enzyme and UV-visible spectroscopy to characterize the cobalt-substituted enzymes. Zinc binding was studied by EXAFS spectroscopy to allow conclusions concerning modification of bond lengths and ligand composition, whereas PAC spectroscopy was used to probe an eventual distribution of Cd(II) in a mono-Cd(II) species of the H88S mutant enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis of the B. cereus569/H/9 metallo-β-lactamase gene was performed with the help of the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutations were performed in pCIP102. The desired mutants were identified by DNA sequencing on minipreps. The BcII genes containing the mutation were cloned into the pET9a plasmid. The different mutated genes were isolated from pCIP102 by digestion with the restriction enzymes NdeI andBamHI. They were cloned into pET9a digested with the same enzymes to yield pCIP103-H116S, pCIP103-H118S, pCIP103-H196S, pCIP103-H263S, and pCIP103-D102N (new numbering of amino acids according to Ref. 1Galleni M.

The C168A and C168S mutants were produced and purified as described (5Paul Soto R. Bauer R. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H.F. Rossolini G.M. de Seny D. Hernandez Valladares M.

The purity and the molecular masses of all purified proteins were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Further details of production and characterization will be published elsewhere together with a detailed analysis of protein stability, pH, and substrate profiles of the mutant enzymes. 2D. de Seny, C.

The protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 30500m−1 cm−1 for WT BcII and all mutants except C168A, for which a value of 31000m−1 cm−1 was used. Zinc concentrations in samples and in the final dialysis buffers were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy in the flame mode as described (12Hernandez Valladares M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To produce “metal-free” buffers, buffer solutions in bi-distilled water were treated by extensive stirring with Chelex 100 (Sigma). Apo-enzymes were prepared by dialysis of the corresponding enzymes against two changes of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.2m NaCl and 20 mm EDTA over a 12-h period under stirring. EDTA was removed from the resulting apoenzyme solution by three dialysis steps against the same buffer containing 1m NaCl and Chelex-100 and finally two dialysis steps against 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 mNaCl and Chelex-100. In all preparations the residual zinc content did not exceed 5% as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Reactivation of the apo-enzymes was studied with 100 μmImipenem (Merck Sharp and Dohme, Bruxelles, Belgium) as the substrate in presence of 100 μm Zn(II) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl. Initial rates were determined using ΔA300 nm = −9000m−1 cm−1. All apo-enzymes could be reactivated, resulting in activities of 65–85% of the expected values. The dissociation constants for a first (K(mononuclear)) and second (K(binuclear)) zinc or cadmium ion bound were obtained from competition experiments with the chromophoric chelator Mag-fura-2 (MF; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The indicator was titrated with metal in absence and presence of apo-enzyme (protein/indicator ratios were between 1:1 and 1:3) monitoring changes in absorbance at 363 nm. The program Chemsim (developed by R. Kramer, Saarbruecken, Germany) was used for numerical data analysis. The program allows analysis of binding experiments involving arbitrary combinations of coupled equilibria (13Hernandez Valladares M. Kiefer M. Heinz U. Paul Soto R. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H.F. Zeppezauer M. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Adolph H.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For calculations involving coupled equilibria, a combination of a Simplex algorithm with a Newton-Raphson procedure was used to minimize the sum of least squares. A data file for the experiments described here contains the total absorbance measured as a function of added volume of a metal ion stock solution of known concentration to a defined starting volume. Simulated absorbance values are calculated numerically for each titration step as the sum of relative contributions of contributing compounds (e.g. Atotal = εMF[MF] + εMe-MF[Me-MF]). Starting concentrations of compounds, absorption coefficients and dissociation constants can undergo iterative optimization in arbitrary combinations. Therefore, equations are generated that include the laws of mass action, the ionic product of water (if necessary), and the equations for mass conservation. The number of equations is in all cases equal to the number of species in the simulated system. From simultaneous fittings of dissociation constants, absorption coefficients, and apo-enzyme concentrations, these values could be obtained with high precision and were used for calculations of all enzyme concentration-dependent parameters. The following equilibria were used for fitting.Me­MF↔K(Me­MF)Me+MFK(Me­MF)=[Me][MF][Me­MF]Eq. 1 Me­BcII↔K(mononuclear)Me+apo­BcIIEq. 2 K(mononuclear)=[Me][apo­BcII][Me­BcII]Me2­BcII↔K(binuclear)Me+Me­BcIIEq. 3 K(binuclear)=[Me][Me­BcII][Me2­BcII] The dissociation constant obtained for the Zn(II)-Mag-fura-2 complex was 81 (± 5) nm with εMF, 363 nm = 28,500 m−1 cm−1, slightly deviating from the reported values (14Simons T.J.B. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1993; 27: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) obtained under different conditions. For Cd(II), KCd-MF = 126 (± 12) nm resulted (see Fig. 1). The UV-visible bands of the Co1 enzymes were used to estimate the dissociation constants directly from the spectroscopic data using numerical fitting of a one-step binding model (Equation2). Kinetics of Zn(II), Cd(II), and Co(II) binding could be followed by monitoring metal ion-induced changes of protein fluorescence. The experiments were performed with a DX17.MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (Applied Photophysics). Two consecutive processes could be observed at high metal ion concentrations requiring a two-step binding model for data analysis. Only for the binding of Cd(II) were the rate constants of both processes so different that the two phases could each be treated as independent pseudo-first order reactions. From fits of mono-exponential functions to both phases with two different time intervals (see Fig.4 B), a dependence of apparent rate constants (kapp) on the metal ion concentration ([Me]) was found that could be interpreted according to Equation 4 for total metal ion concentrations much larger than the total enzyme concentration. kapp=kon[Me]+koffEq. 4 Binding of Co(II) resulted in biphasic reaction traces, which were evaluated by fitting bi-exponential functions to the data. Because both phases occurred with kapp values deviating by less than 1 order of magnitude and the second phase showed only about 20% of the amplitude of the first more rapid phase, only the first rate constant could be obtained with reliability. For Zn(II) binding, the amplitude of the second reaction phase was too low to allow data evaluation (see Fig. 4 E); therefore only the first binding process resulted in a reliable association rate constant. The Zn K-edge was monitored at beam line D2 at DESY/Hamburg running at 4.5-GeV and 70–125-mA current in fluorescence mode. Standard EXAFS analysis was performed using the EXPROG software package 3Developed by C. Hermes and H. F.

Binsted N. Ross I. J. Phys. Chem. 1984; 17: 143-151Google Scholar) to analyze the spectra. Phases were calculated ab initio using Hedin-Lundqvist potentials and von Barth ground states (17Hedin L. Lundqvist S. Solid State Phys. 1969; 23: 1-181Google Scholar). Both single and multiple scattering paths up to 4.5 Å from the metal atom were used to identify and quantify imidazole coordination of histidine ligands. The fitting process included constraints for the following parameters. The energy range was set to 30–650 eV above the edge. Two coordination clusters were introduced, each having an integer number of ligands. The fit then determined the fractional occupancy of each cluster for the mononuclear enzyme if the metal ions were distributed between the two metal sites. For the binuclear case, the occupancy of the two clusters was fixed to 0.5. Theoretical fits were generated by adding shells of scatterers around the central zinc atoms and iterating the number of scatterers, bond lengths, and Debye-Waller factors in each shell. Additionally, the Fermi energy, EF (edge position relative to calculated vacuum position), was iterated to achieve the best fit to the experimental data. The improvement of the fit after the addition of each additional shell beyond the first was assessed by comparing the residual R-factor (18Joyner R.W. Martin K.J. Meehan P. J. Phys. C Solid State Phys. 1987; 20: 4005-4012Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Distances and Debye-Waller factors of the outer shell atoms of imidazole rings were constrained assuming the Debye-Waller factors of atoms with similar distance to the absorber to be equal. Because the constraints for the Debye-Waller factors are unique for each parameter set, the details are summarized in Table II.Table IIResults of theoretical EXAFS data analysis for wild type Zn1 - and Zn2 -BcII and Zn2 species of the C168S and H210S mutantsThe presented values correspond to the theoretical fits shown in Fig. 5. Two binding sites were introduced in the fitting process as independent clusters. Since minor deviations in the distance of identical ligand types cannot be separated with statistical reliability they were grouped. Thus the three histidines in the 3H site were not treated separately. Additionally, other first and second sphere scatterers were grouped in cases when a separate treatment was found to be unreliable as judged from the results of the calculated correlation matrices. Coordination numbers (Ni ) were constrained to be integer values. This could be done since fitting ofNi for first shell ligands resulted in values deviating by <5% of the rounded given values.

In the case of identical, static and randomly oriented molecules, the perturbation function G2(t) is as shown in Equation5,G2(t)=a0+a1cos(ω1t)+a2cos(ω2t)+a3cos(ω3t)Eq. 5 with ω1, ω2, and ω3 as the three difference frequencies between the three sublevels of the spin 5/2 state of the cadmium nucleus (21Bauer R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1985; 18: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Note that ω1+ ω2 = ω3. Thus, the Fourier transform of G2(t) exhibits three frequencies for each NQI. The Fourier transformation was performed as described (20Bauer R. Danielsen E. Hemmingsen L. Sørensen M.V. Ulstrup J. Friis E.P. Auld D.S. Bjerrum M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11514-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The NQI is described by the numerically largest diagonal element after diagonalization, chosen as ωzz, which is denoted ω0 and η = (ωxx - ωyy)/ωzz. The relationship between these two parameters and the frequencies in G2(t) can be found in Ref. 21Bauer R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1985; 18: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. Thus, from the time dependence of G2(t), ω0 and η, determined through least squares fitting, reflect the coordination geometry of the cadmium ion. In the liquid state the NQI is time-dependent because of the Brownian reorientation of the protein, described by the rotational diffusion time, τR. Consequently, G2(t) converges to 0 as a function of time, representing thermal equilibrium and isotropy in the angular correlation between the two γ-rays. The perturbation function, A2G2(t), where A2 is the amplitude, was analyzed by a conventional nonlinear least squares fitting routine. Satisfactory fitting was obtained with a relative Gaussian distribution, δ = Δω0/ω0, applied to all of the three frequencies. Non-zero values for δ indicate a distribution of the111mCd nuclei among different surroundings. A NQI is then described by the parameters ω0, η, δ, and τR. In cases where more than a single NQI is present, the perturbation function is the sum of the different perturbation functions, where each NQI is weighted by its population (20Bauer R. Danielsen E. Hemmingsen L. Sørensen M.V. Ulstrup J. Friis E.P. Auld D.S. Bjerrum M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11514-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We performed competition experiments with the chromophoric chelator Mag-fura-2 for the determination of dissociation constants for zinc and cadmium ions to the metal-free enzymes. The titration data for the chelator MF with Cd(II) ions are shown in Fig. 1 A. The spectra show an isosbestic point at 270 nm and maxima at 363 and 330 nm for the metal-free compound and the 1:1 cadmium complex, respectively. Fig. 1,B and D, represents Cd(II) binding to the H88S mutant as a typical example of the experimental data and fitting. Fitting a one-step binding model (Equations 1 and 2) to the data resulted in unsatisfactory residuals for all enzyme species tested. As no change in absorbance occurs before a concentration of about 2 μm Cd(II) ions is reached (Fig. 1 D), the enzyme has a higher affinity for cadmium than MF. In the end phase of the titration additional competition with MF for the binding of a second metal ion to the enzyme must occur, because saturation of the chelator needs higher concentrations of metal than expected for a one-step binding model (thin line in Fig. 1 D). Thus a binding model with two equilibria for subsequent formation of Me1 and Me2 enzyme should be used for fitting (Equations Eq. 1, Eq. 2, Eq. 3). The resulting dissociation constants are summarized in Table I. All enzyme species investigated show a high and a low affinity macroscopic dissociation constant corresponding to high affinity for binding a first zinc or cadmium ion and significantly weaker affinity for binding a second ion. The high and low affinity macroscopic dissociation constants for the different enzyme samples differ generally by less than two orders of magnitude from the dissociation constants of the Me-MF complex. Thus, a sufficiently high data point density in both bend regions of the titration curves allowed the simultaneous determination of both dissociation constants with statistical reliability.Table IDissociation constants of Me1 and Me2 species of wild type and mutant BcIIEnzyme speciesK(mononuclear)K(binuclear)Zn(II)Cd(II)Co(II)Zn(II)Cd(II)Co(II)nmnmμmμmμmμmWild type0.628.30.0931.505.966.7(± 0.08)(± 0.5)(± 0.015)(± 0.71)(± 1.0)(± 10.0)H86S5.30ND10.50.32NDND(± 2.34)(± 1.5)(± 0.11)H88S0.383.89.11.131.4ND(± 0.15)(± 0.3)(± 1.1)(± 0.19)(± 0.1)H149S3.11ND2.70.19NDND(± 0.05)(± 0.3)(± 0.02)D90N2.00ND20.05.02NDND(± 0.39)(± 3.5)(± 2.39)C168S0.61ND3.12.34NDND(± 0.19)(± 0.4)(± 0.59)C168ANDND1.1NDNDND(± 0.1)H210S0.43ND0.352.53NDND(± 0.11)(± 0.05)(± 0.50)Data for Zn(II) and Cd(II) binding were obtained from competition titrations with Mag-fura-2 as described under “Materials and Methods.” Dissociation constants for Co(II) complexes were derived from spectral changes of the enzyme upon Co(II) binding.K(mononuclear) and K(binuclear) represent the macroscopic dissociation constants of the Me-BcII and Me2-BcII complexes, respectively; ND, not determined.

However, since not all glutamatergic neurons contain BNPI, an additional transporter(s) responsible for vesicular glutamate uptake has been postulated.

To use l-glutamate as an intercellular signaling molecule, neuronal cells develop glutamatergic systems comprising the storage of glutamate in synaptic vesicles and its exocytosis (signal output), glutamate receptors (signal input), and glutamate reuptake systems (signal termination). Recent evidence has indicated that peripheral endocrine cells also develop glutamatergic systems (3Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. Yamada H. Tashiro Y. Futa M. Biol.

Very recently brain-specific Na+-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter (BNPI),1 representing a family of proteins that use the inwardly directed Na+gradient across the membrane and transport inorganic phosphate (7Ni B.

A. 1994; 91: 5607-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), has been identified as the vesicular glutamate transporter in synaptic vesicles (8Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T.

Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Upon expression in either PC12 or BON6 cells, BNPI becomes associated with secretory vesicles and accumulatesl-glutamate (8Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H.

BNPI is associated with synaptic vesicles in various glutamatergic neurons (8Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Differentiation-associated Na+-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter (DNPI), a homologue of BNPI isolated from AR42J cells differentiating into neuroendocrine cells, shows 82% amino acid identity and 92% similarity to human BNPI (13Aihara Y. Mashima H. Onda H. Hisano S. Kasuya H. Hori T. Yamada S. Tomura H. Yamada Y. Inoue I. Kojima I. Takeda J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2622-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In human and rat, the DNPI gene as well as the DNPI protein was shown to be expressed in neurons in various regions, especially in the encephalon, its expression patterns being somewhat different from that of BNPI (14Hisano S. Hoshi K. Ikeda Y. Maruyama D. Kanemoto M. Ichijo H. Kojima I. Takeda J. Nogami H. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 83: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Sakata-Haga H. Kanemoto M. Maruyama D.

Kaneko T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 435: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNPI was shown to be located in synaptic vesicles in the neocortex (16Fujiwara F. Furuta T. Kaneko T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 435: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). One can expect that DNPI is another vesicular glutamate transporter. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis and found that DNPI shows ATP-dependent glutamate transport activity when expressed in COS7 cells. We also showed that besides its presence in neurons DNPI is also present in pinealocytes, αTC6 cells, and α and pancreatic polypeptide-secreting F cells in Langerhans islets, which contain a glutamatergic system. Pineal glands and Langerhans islets were isolated from male Wistar rats at postnatal week 6. COS7 cells and αTC6 cells, a clonal α cell line (17Hamaguchi K. Leiter E.H. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 415-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 55 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 0.1 mg/liter streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.25 mg/liter Fungizone and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The dispersed cells were washed three times with the above medium, then placed in a 35-mm culture dish coated with poly-l-lysine to give 2.0 × 105cells/dish, and cultured in the above medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Pinealocytes were cultured as described previously (18Yamada H. Yatsushiro S. Ishio S. Hayashi M. Nishi T. Yamamoto A. Futai M. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2056-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experimental procedures, cells were maintained for 5 days, washed with culture medium, cultured further for 1 h, and then used for experiments. Rat DNPI cDNA, as previously described (13Aihara Y. Mashima H. Onda H. Hisano S. Kasuya H. Hori T. Yamada S. Tomura H. Yamada Y. Inoue I. Kojima I. Takeda J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2622-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the EcoRI site of expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The resultant construct, DNPI-pcDNA3.1, was used to transfect COS7 cells by lipofection using Trans IT reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After incubation for 24 h in 35-mm dishes, DNPI-pcDNA3.1 or the pcDNA3.1 vector alone was transfected into COS7 cells by adding 2 μg of the plasmid DNA/dish. After further incubation for 48 h, the cells were rinsed with 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0), 0.3 m sucrose, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 4 mm KCl and then used for further experiments. Total RNA extracted from isolated glands (1 μg) was transcribed into cDNA in a final volume of 20 μl of a reaction buffer containing 0.5 mm of each dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 pmol of random hexamers, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After a 1-h incubation at 42 °C, the reaction was terminated by heating at 90 °C for 5 min. For PCR amplification, the 10-fold-diluted synthesized cDNA solution was added to the reaction buffer containing 1.2 mm total dNTP (300 μm of each dNTP), 6 pmol of primers, and 0.5 units of PLATINUM Pfx DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Thirty temperature cycles were conducted, each cycle being as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at temperatures specific for each set of primers for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. The amplification products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used as primers were based on published sequences (13Aihara Y. Mashima H. Onda H. Hisano S. Kasuya H. Hori T. Yamada S. Tomura H. Yamada Y. Inoue I. Kojima I. Takeda J. J.

For Northern blot analysis, mRNA (4.5 μg) isolated from pineal gland or other tissues was separated on a formaldehyde agarose gel (1%) and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immobilized RNA was probed with cDNA fragments of DNPI labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. After extensive washing, the membrane was subjected to autoradiography using BAS 1000 film (Fuji Film Co.). DNPI-expressing COS7 cells were rinsed with 1 ml of buffer comprising 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0), 0.3 msucrose, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 4 mm KCl. The cells were then permeabilized for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of the same buffer containing 10 μm digitonin (19Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. Hoffman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 20Yamada H. Otuska M. Hayashi M. Nakatsuka S. Hamaguchi K. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The medium was then replaced with fresh buffer containing Tris-ATP at 2 mm in the absence of digitonin. In some experiments, bafilomycin A1 or other chemicals were also included in the medium at the specified concentrations. Then glutamate uptake was immediately started by the addition of radioactive l-glutamate (2.5 μCi, 0.1 mm) at 37 °C as described previously (20Yamada H. Otuska M. Hayashi M. Nakatsuka S. Hamaguchi K. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After a 10-min incubation, uptake was terminated by washing the cells twice with 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0) containing 0.3 m sucrose. Then the cells were lysed with 1 ml of 1% SDS, and the radioactivity and protein concentration were measured. In some experiments, radioactive d-aspartate (2.5 μCi, 0.1 mm) was used for the substrate. Site-specific polyclonal antibodies against rat DNPI were raised in rabbits using synthetic polypeptides corresponding to the C-terminal 12 residues (C)DAYSYKDRDDYS (GenBankTM accession number AAF76223). The polypeptide was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem) with m-maleimidebenzoyl-N-hydrosuccinimide ester. The monoclonal antibodies against synaptophysin and vimentin (VIM3B4) were obtained from Progen. The monoclonal antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein and OX42 were purchased from Reo Markers and Cosmo Bio, respectively. The mouse monoclonal antibodies against EEA1 and Rab 5, for early endosomes, and GM130, for the cis Golgi apparatus, were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal antibodies against protein disulfide isomerase for endoplasmic reticulum were from Fuji Yakuhin Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Toyama, Japan). The monoclonal antibodies against glucagon and insulin (MAB1) were from Sigma and Cymbus Biotechnology Ltd., respectively. The rat monoclonal antibodies against somatostatin were from Chemicon. Guinea pig polyclonal antisera against rat pancreatic polypeptide were from Linco Research, Inc. Membrane fractions (particulate fractions) of rat brain, pineal gland, Langerhans islets, and cultured cells prepared as described previously (18Yamada H. Yatsushiro S. Ishio S. Hayashi M. Nishi T.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were denatured with SDS sample buffer containing 1% SDS and 10% β-mercaptoethanol and then electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS. Following electrotransfer at 0.3 A for 2 h, the nitrocellulose filters were blocked in a buffer consisting of 20 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 4 h and then probed with 1000-fold diluted anti-DNPI antibodies in the same buffer. The filters were washed with 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, treated with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:2000 for 30 min, washed further with the same buffer, and then subjected to ECL amplification according to the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The previously published procedure was used (21Hayashi M. Yamamoto A. Yatsushiro S. Yamada H. Futai M. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Hayashi M. Haga M. Yatsushiro S. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2538-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, cells on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, then further incubated with 2% goat serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in the same buffer, and finally incubated with antibodies at the specified dilution as described in the figure legends in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with the second antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The second antibodies used were AlexaFluor 568-labeled anti-mouse IgG at 1 μg/ml, AlexaFluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG at 2 μg/ml, Cy3-labeled goat anti-rat IgG at 1 μg/ml, Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG at 2 μg/ml, or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-guinea pig IgG at 2 μg/ml. These second antibodies were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Molecular Probes. Finally, immunoreactivity was examined under an Olympus Fluoview FV300 confocal laser microscope. DNA sequencing was performed by the chain-termination method (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with a Pierce Protein Assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. l-[2,3-3H]Glutamate (9.25 MBq) and d-[2,3-3H]aspartate (9.25 MBq)were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Digitonin was purchased from Wako Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. To examine whether or not DNPI is a vesicular glutamate transporter, DNPI was expressed in COS7 cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, anti-DNPI antibodies recognized a major broad protein band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa when DNPI-pcDNA3.1, a DNPI-expressing vector, was transfected to COS7 cells. The molecular mass corresponding to the DNPI immunoreactivity is similar to that expected from its primary amino acid sequence and DNPI from the brain (Fig.1 A). Two additional protein bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼72 and ∼42 kDa were also observed. Neither untransfected control COS7 cells nor COS cells transfected with a control vector expressed any DNPI gene, as revealed on RT-PCR analysis (data not shown), or the immunoreactive polypeptide (Fig. 1 A). The DNPI immunoreactivity disappeared when the antigenic polypeptide was included during antibody treatment (Fig. 1 A). These results indicated that DNPI is expressed in COS7 cells. The expressed DNPI was distributed throughout COS7 cells (Fig.1 B). Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that DNPI is co-localized with EEA1 or Rab 5, early endosomal markers (Fig.1 C). DNPI is partially co-localized with GM130, a marker protein of the cis Golgi apparatus but not with protein disulfide isomerase, a marker protein of endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.1 C). These results suggest that DNPI is mainly associated with early endosomes in the cells. We examined whether or not DNPI shows vesicular glutamate transport activity. As shown in Fig. 1 D, digitonin-permeabilized DNPI-expressing cells took up radiolabeled l-glutamate depending on ATP. Neither untransfected control cells nor cells transfected with a control vector showed ATP-dependent glutamate uptake activity. The omission of Mg2+ reduced the ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake to the control level. Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase (24Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar), at 1 μm inhibited the ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake. SF6847, a proton conductor that dissipates an electrochemical proton gradient, also inhibited the ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake. In contrast, vanadate (1 mm), an inhibitor of P-type ion-transporting ATPases, did not affect the ATP-dependent glutamate uptake. These results indicated that the glutamate uptake is driven by an electrochemical gradient of protons established by vacuolar H+-ATPase. The addition of either l-aspartate or d-aspartate at 1.0 mm during the assay had a little effect on the ATP-dependent glutamate uptake, indicating that the glutamate transporter does not recognize l-aspartate ord-aspartate as a substrate, one of the characteristics of vesicular glutamate transporters (25Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 26Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22314-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The inability of DNPI to transport d-aspartate was also confirmed by the direct uptake assay (Fig. 1 D). Together these results indicate that DNPI is responsible for the vesicular storage ofl-glutamate. Besides the central nervous system, peripheral endocrine tissues possess glutamatergic systems (3Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. Yamada H. Tashiro Y. Futa M. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar, 4Moriyama Y. Hayashi M. Yamada H. Yatsushiro S. Ishio S. Yamamoto A. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian pinealocytes accumulatel-glutamate in SLMVs, counterparts of synaptic vesicles in endocrine cells, and secrete it to the extracellular space through exocytosis (28Yamada H. Yamamoto A. Yodozawa S. Nozaki S. Takahashi M. Michibata H. Morita M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Moriyama Y. J. Pineal Res. 1996; 21: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Yatsushiro S. Yamada H. Kozaki S. Kumon H. Michibata H. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Vesicular glutamate transporter is responsible for the storage of l-glutamate in pineal SLMVs (27Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22314-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not DNPI is expressed in pinealocytes, expression of the DNPI gene in pineal gland was examined by RT-PCR using specific DNA probes. As shown in Fig.2 A, amplified products of expected size for DNPI were obtained when total RNAs isolated from pineal glands and cultured pineal cells as well as brain were used. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the amplified products exactly matched that of the DNPI gene. Northern blot analysis with the amplified RT-PCR products further demonstrated the expression of mRNA for DNPI in pineal glands: two major bands (∼3.2 and 4.1 kilobases) for pineal glands and brain mRNA were detected (Fig. 2 B). Western blot analysis indicated that the anti-DNPI antibodies recognized a single polypeptide of ∼65 kDa in pineal glands, cultured pinealocytes, and brain membranes (Fig.2 C). The DNPI immunoreactivity was blocked when the nitrocellulose sheet was treated with an antigenic peptide during the immunodecoration (Fig. 2 C). Overall it is concluded that DNPI is expressed in pineal glands and cultured pinealocytes. Immunohistochemistry with frozen-sectioned pineal gland revealed the localization of DNPI at the cellular level. We used the following cell markers to classify DNPI-positive cells: synaptophysin for pinealocytes (30Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Redecker P. Bargsten G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), glial fibrillary acidic protein for astrocytes (32Papasozomenos S.C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1983; 42: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), OX42 for microglia (33Pedersen E.B. Fox L.M. Castro A.J. McNulty J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and vimentin for interstitial cells (34Schachner M. Huang S.K. Ziegelmuller P. Bizzini B. Taugner R. Cell Tissue Res. 1984; 237: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The antibodies against these marker proteins immunostained the corresponding populations of pineal cells with a similar morphology as reported previously (33Pedersen E.B. Fox L.M. Castro A.J. McNulty J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Yamada H. Yatsushiro S. Yamamoto A. Nishi T. Futai M. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 D). The DNPI-positive cells coincided with synaptophysin but not with any of the above-mentioned cell markers, indicating that pinealocytes contain DNPI (Fig. 2 D). Essentially the same results were obtained for cultured pineal cells (data not shown). DNPI and synaptophysin are enriched in the process terminal regions, the site for glutamate exocytosis (3Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. Yamada H. Tashiro Y. Futa M. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar, 4Moriyama Y. Hayashi M. Yamada H. Yatsushiro S. Ishio S. Yamamoto A. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 E). These results strongly suggested that DNPI is associated with SLMVs in pinealocytes. Langerhans islets express various types of ionotropic glutamate receptors and reuptake systems (36Inagaki N. Kuromi H. Gonoi T. Okamoto Y. Ishida H. Seino Y. Kaneko T. Iwanaga T. Seino S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 37Weaver C.D. Yao T.L. Powers A.C. Verdoon T.A. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1647-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clonal pancreatic αTC6 cells store and secretel-glutamate through exocytosis, the mechanism being similar to those in neurons and pinealocytes (20Yamada H. Otuska M. Hayashi M. Nakatsuka S. Hamaguchi K. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Langerhans islets are another example of an endocrine glutamatergic system and that DNPI is responsible for the storage ofl-glutamate in the islets. To examine this possibility, the expression of DNPI in αTC6 cells and islets was measured. RT-PCR analysis indicated the presence of DNPI mRNA in αTC6 cells (Fig.3 A). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry indicated the presence of DNPI in αTC6 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Langerhans islets are composed of four major types of endocrine cells,i.e. insulin-secreting β cells, glucagon-secreting α cells, pancreatic polypeptide-secreting F cells, and somatostatin-secreting δ cells. Western blotting clearly indicated the presence of DNPI in the islets (Fig. 3 B). DNPI was co-localized with glucagon but not with insulin or somatostatin in horizontal sections of the islets, indicating the presence of DNPI in α cells but not in β or δ cells (Fig. 3 C). DNPI is also co-localized with pancreatic polypeptides. These results suggested that DNPI is mainly present in α cells and partially in pancreatic polypeptide-secreting F cells (Fig. 3 C). Vesicular glutamate transporter is responsible for the glutamatergic characteristics of neurons and was originally identified in synapsin I-associated synaptic vesicles (25Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 39Naito S. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 696-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the earlier stage of studies, vesicular glutamate transporter was defined as the ATP-dependent proton conductor-sensitive glutamate transport activity in synaptic vesicles, but little was known about the protein nature of the transporter at the molecular level (25Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 26Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. J. Biol.

In the last year, two groups have independently reported that BNPI is vesicular glutamate transporter itself and that BNPI is a potential tool for substantial studies on vesicular glutamate transporter. DNPI is a potential candidate for another vesicular glutamate transporter since DNPI is distributed throughout the brain, being especially abundant in the nerve endings of glutamatergic neurons where BNPI is scarce (15Sakata-Haga H. Kanemoto M. Maruyama D. Hoshi K. Mogi K. Narita M. Okado N. Ikeda Y. Nogami H. Fukui Y. Kojima I. Takeda J. Hisano S. Brain Res. 2001; 902: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Fujiwara F. Furuta T. Kaneko T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 435: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Here we showed that DNPI actually functions as a vesicular glutamate transporter when expressed in COS7 cells. DNPI expressed in COS7 cells seems to be mainly localized in endosomes. Since endosomes contain vacuolar H+-ATPase (40Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 41Nerlson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), the active transport of glutamate into the organelles should be expected upon the addition of ATP in digitonin-permeabilized cells. In fact, digitonin-permeabilized cells took up l-glutamate depending on MgATP, and the properties of the uptake are consistent with those of vesicular glutamate transporter (25Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 26Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1983; 258: 696-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that DNPI expressed functions as a vesicular glutamate transporter. The fact that DNPI exhibits vesicular glutamate transport activity is not surprising since the amino acid identity of the core portions of DNPI and BNPI excluding their hydrophilic N- and C-terminal regions is over 90% with 12 putative transmembrane helices (7Ni B. Rosteck Jr., P.R. Nadi N.S. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5607-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 13Aihara Y. Mashima H. Onda H. Hisano S. Kasuya H. Hori T. Yamada S. Tomura H. Yamada Y. Inoue I. Kojima I. Takeda J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2622-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the original studies on the expression and functions of BNPI and DNPI, both proteins were found to facilitate the transport of inorganic phosphate depending on extracellular Na+ (7Ni B. Rosteck Jr., P.R. Nadi N.S. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5607-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 13Aihara Y. Mashima H. Onda H. Hisano S. Kasuya H. Hori T. Yamada S. Tomura H. Yamada Y. Inoue I. Kojima I. Takeda J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2622-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). On the other hand, vesicular glutamate transporters use a proton as a coupling ion and only recognize l-glutamate and a few cyclic glutamate analogues as substrates (25Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 26Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Thus, DNPI and BNPI are versatile in their coupling ions and substrate specificity in nature. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the versatility and to assign the domains responsible for the Na+-dependent inorganic phosphate transport and proton-coupled glutamate transport. A significant finding in this study is that DNPI is expressed in glutamatergic endocrine cells. Recent studies have revealed that some endocrine cells secrete l-glutamate through exocytosis, and the released glutamate may function as a paracrine or autocrine chemical transmitter by way of a glutamate receptor expressed on the same or neighboring cells (3Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. Yamada H. Tashiro Y. Futa M. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar, 4Moriyama Y. Hayashi M. Yamada H. Yatsushiro S. Ishio S. Yamamoto A. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicular glutamate transporters play a key role in glutamate signal output through the storage ofl-glutamate in endocrine cells. Consistent with the presence of glutamatergic systems, DNPI is present in pinealocytes and is co-localized with SLMVs. Thus, DNPI may function to storel-glutamate in SLMVs and secrete it through exocytosis, which is one of the components of the negative regulatory mechanism for melatonin synthesis. Not all pinealocytes processes are positive for DNPI (Fig. 2 E, arrows and arrowheads), indicating the functional heterogeneity of SLMVs in pinealocytes as suggested by Redecker (42Redecker P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 191: 201-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that DNPI is present in αTC6 cells and α cells in Langerhans islets. DNPI is also present in pancreatic polypeptide-secreting F cells, suggesting that pancreatic polypeptide-secreting F cells are capable of storing and secretingl-glutamate. Therefore, α cells and possibly pancreatic peptide-secreting F cells are the sites for the glutamate release in the islets, which was first proposed by Weaver et al. (38Weaver C.D. Gundersen V. Verdoorn T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1647-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, Langerhans islets may equip their own input, output, and termination systems for glutamate signals. Although the physiological role(s) of the glutamatergic system in the islets is not fully understood at present, the glutamate may regulate the secretion of insulin and glucagon by way of its binding to the receptors in α and β cells (43Bertrand G. Gross R. Puech R. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Bockaert J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 44Bertrand G. Gross R. Puech R. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Bockaert J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 237: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A role of l-glutamate as an intracellular signaling molecule in β cells, which enhances the second phase of insulin secretion, has also been postulated (45Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In conclusion, DNPI is an indicator for glutamatergic systems in peripheral tissues as well as neurons and is a very useful probe for studies on peripheral glutamatergic systems. We are extensively studying the localization of DNPI in various organs, which will reveal the site where l-glutamate acts as an intercellular signaling molecule in peripheral organs. Just before our submission, Bai et al.(46Bai L. Xu H. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36764-36769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) cloned mouse cDNA similar to DNPI. When this cDNA was expressed in PC12 cells, the vesicular glutamate transport activity appeared."

InNeurospora, the circadian clock protein FREQUENCY (FRQ) is progressively phosphorylated over time, and its level decreases when it is hyperphosphorylated. In this study, we showed that most of the kinase activity phosphorylating FRQ in vitro was calcium/calmodulin-dependent, and the endogenous FRQ in theNeurospora extracts was phosphorylated by a Ca/CaM-dependent kinase-like activity. FromNeurospora cell extracts, an ∼50-kDa Ca/CaM-dependent kinase (CAMK-1) that can specifically phosphorylate FRQ was purified. In vitro, this kinase accounts for near half of the FRQ kinase activity, and it can phosphorylate the FRQ region that contains the three known functionally important phosphorylation sites. To understand the function of camk-1 in vivo, it was disrupted inNeurospora by gene replacement. After germination from ascospores, the camk-1 null strains grew slowly, indicating that CAMK-1 plays an important role in growth and development ofNeurospora. This phenotype was transient however, revealing redundancy in the system. Analysis of the camk-1 null strain revealed that the deletion of camk-1 affected phase, period, and light-induced phase shifting of the circadian conidiation rhythm. Taken together, our results suggest that multiple kinases may phosphorylate FRQ in vivo. Phosphorylation of circadian clock proteins represents a major regulatory step that controls circadian clocks.

In the Neurospora frq-wc-based circadian feedback loops, WHITE COLLAR-1 (WC-1)1 and WC-2, two (Per-Amt-Sim) domain-containing transcription factors, form heterodimeric complexes to activate the transcription offrequency (frq) (8Crosthwaite S.K.

Besides its role in repressing frq transcription, FRQ proteins positively regulate protein levels of both WC-1 and WC-2, thereby forming positive feedback loops interlocked with the negative feedback loop (10Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 15Merrow M. Franchi L. Dragovic Z. Gorl M. Johnson J. Brunner M. Macino G. Roenneberg T.

These positive feedback loops appear to be important for maintaining the robustness and stability of the clock. Although transcriptional regulation seems to play a major role in rhythm generation, it is becoming more and more evident that various posttranscriptional mechanisms also have important influence on rhythm generation. Phosphorylation of clock proteins is one of the major posttranscriptional mechanisms that regulate circadian clock functions in all clock model systems, and the kinases responsible are important components of the circadian systems (11Garceau N.

Science. 2001; 291: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). For example, inDrosophila, the DOUBLE-TIME protein, a casein kinase I, acts to phosphorylate the clock protein PERIOD. In a dbt null mutant, the steady-state level of PERIOD is high and hypophosphorylated, suggesting that the phosphorylation of PERIOD may lead to its degradation (21Price J.L. Blau J. Rothenfluh A. Adodeely M. Kloss B. Young M.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 83-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 22Kloss B. Price J.L. Saez L. Blau J. Rothenfluh A. Young M.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). InNeurospora, FRQ protein is progressively phosphorylated over time after its synthesis, and extensive phosphorylation of FRQ results in its eventual degradation. Two lines of evidence support the conclusion that one of the functions of FRQ phosphorylation is to lead to its degradation (18Liu Y. Loros J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). First, a kinase inhibitor that blocks FRQ phosphorylation in vivo reduces the degradation rate of FRQ and lengthens the period of the clock. Second, mutation of one phosphorylation site at Ser-513 of FRQ leads to a dramatic reduction of the rate of FRQ degradation and a long period (>30 h) of the clock. Thus, phosphorylation of FRQ is a major determining factor for FRQ stability and for the period length of the Neurosporacircadian clock. In this study, we have purified a Neurospora calcium (Ca)/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent kinase (CAMK-1) protein that phosphorylates FRQ. Our data showed that the majority of FRQ phosphorylation in vitro is Ca/CaM-dependent.In vitro kinase assays indicate that CAMK-1 can phosphorylate the FRQ region containing Ser-513. Disruption of thecamk-1 gene suggests that camk-1 plays an important role in the normal growth and development ofNeurospora. However, the camk-1 null phenotypes were transient, revealing redundancy in the system. The analysis of the conidiation rhythm revealed that the clock is affected in thecamk-1 null strain. The bd,astrain was used as the wild-type strain in this study. Liquid culture conditions were the same as described previously (3Aronson B. Johnson K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1578-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Media forNeurospora slants were 1× Vogel's, 2% sucrose, and 1.5% agar. Measurement of circadian period was performed on race tubes containing glucose/arginine medium (1× Vogel's, 0.1% glucose, 0.17% arginine, 50 ng/ml biotin, and 1.5% agar). Densitometric analysis of race tubes and calculations of period length and phase were performed as described (12Liu Y. Garceau N. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) using Chrono II version 11.1 (Dr. Till Roenneberg, Ludwigs-Maximillian University, Munich, Germany). Analysis of phase response to light was performed on race tubes containing acetate/casamino acid medium (1× Vogel's, 1.2% sodium acetate, 0.05% casamino acid hydrolysate, and 1.5% agar), which results in condensed conidia bands and a more precise measurement of phase (27Dharmananda S. Studies of the Circadian Clock of Neurospora Crassa: Light-induced Phase Shifting. University of California, Santa Cruz1980Google Scholar). Race tubes were first grown in constant light for 24 or 36 h before being transferred into continuous darkness at the same time. Cultures were then grown in the dark for 26 h, and different individual cultures were given a 5-min light pulse (2500 lux) at different times (2–3 h apart) to cover an entire circadian cycle. The phase of the center of the conidiation bands of the light-treated culture (6 replicas for each time point) was compared with those of the control cultures (kept in constant darkness), and the amount of phase shifts was determined. The initial light to darkness transition was defined as circadian time (CT) 12. The phases of the cultures were calculated as the average phase for 4 consecutive days after the light treatment. GST-FRQ and GST-PO4fusion proteins (containing FRQ amino acids (aa) 425–683 or 487–530) were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 cells (Invitrogen) by growing the bacteria at 37 °C to anA600 of 0.5–0.7. The cultures were then transferred to 25 °C and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After a 3-h induction, cultures were harvested, resuspended in 1/50 volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and purified on a glutathione-agarose column as recommended by the supplier (Sigma). The in-gel kinase assay was performed as described previously (28Hibi M. Lin M. Minden M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar, 29Liu Z.P. Galindo R.L. Wasserman S.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3413-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total protein (20–40 µg) prepared from the wild-type strain was subjected to electrophoresis in an 8% SDS-PAGE gel that had been polymerized in the presence of 100 µg/ml of the purified GST or GST-FRQ protein. Following electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in 20% isopropyl alcohol for 30 min, twice with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min, and then denatured by incubating the gel twice for 30 min in buffer B containing 6 m guanidinium HCl. The proteins in the gel were then renatured overnight at 4 °C in buffer B containing 0.05% Tween 20 with at least four changes of the buffer. Then the gel was incubated in kinase buffer (25 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 25 µm ATP) containing 10 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 1 h. When used, 0.15 mm CaCl2 and 14 µg/ml CaM (Sigma) were added to the reaction buffer. Then the gel was washed 5–7 times in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Prestained protein standard markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used in all SDS-PAGE gels. To assay kinase activity, GST-FRQ or GST-PO4 fusion proteins (5 µg) were incubated withNeurospora protein extracts (5–10 µg of total extracts or 40 µl of the chromatographic fractions) in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl, 2 mm MnCl2, 25 µm ATP, and 10 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (total reaction volume of 125 µl). When used, 0.15 mm CaCl2 and 14 µg/ml CaM were added to the reaction buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h before adding 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 10 µl of glutathione-agarose beads. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the glutathione-agarose beads were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline to remove free radionucleotide before they were resuspended and boiled in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography or stained with Coomassie Blue. For detecting phosphorylation of the endogenous FRQ in theNeurospora cell extracts, the Neurospora cell extracts were prepared as described previously (11Garceau N. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The protein concentration of each extract was adjusted to 2 mg/ml with this buffer, and the phosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding 5 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction mixture was incubated 2–4 h at room temperature before an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using FRQ antiserum (11Garceau N. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C, and both in-gel kinase and in vitro kinase assays were used to monitor kinase activity. 100 mg of wild-typeNeurospora total extracts in 20 ml of 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol were applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (50-ml bed volume) that had been equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). The flow-through (containing CAMK-1) was collected and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column (15-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with a 2 column volume of buffer A before the proteins on the column were eluted by buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The eluted protein fraction was then loaded onto a CaM affinity column (1-ml bed volume, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 5 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2. The column was washed with buffer A containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. Proteins on the column were eluted first by buffer A containing 5 mm EGTA and then by buffer A containing 5 mmEGTA and 1 m NaCl. Two NeurosporaEST sequences (SM1H12T3 and SM1C1T3) were found to resemble other eukaryotic Ca/CaM-dependent kinases. To clone the genomic DNA of camk-1, a polymerase chain reaction fragment containing the EST sequence was used to screen the Orbach/Sachs cosmid library of Neurospora (from Fungal Genetic Stock Center). Clone pMOCosX 14:F10, which contained the entire camk-1gene, was identified. A 5.6-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment was cloned into pDE3dBH (30Ebbole D. Sachs M. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1990; 37: 15-16Google Scholar) and sequenced. To make the camk-1KO construct, a BamHI fragment within camk-1 was replaced with a hygromycin-resistant gene cassette. The resulting construct was transformed into a wild-type Neurospora strain (bd,a) (31Bell-Pedersen D. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and transformants containing homologous double recombination events were screened by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis. To make a homokaryotic camk-1knock-out strain, the positive transformants were crossed with a wild-type strain. Individual sexual spores were picked and germinated on slants containing hygromycin (32Davis R.L. deSerres D. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 27A: 79-143Crossref Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Protein extraction, quantification, and Western blot analysis were done as described previously (11Garceau N. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total protein (100 µg) were loaded in each protein lane, and the Western blots were developed by chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify the potential FRQ kinase(s), we first used the in-gel kinase assay, which allows us to estimate the size and the number of the potential kinases. In this assay, GST or GST-FRQ (FRQ aa 425–683, containing the three known FRQ phosphorylation sites) expressed in E. coli was purified and polymerized in SDS-PAGE gel. Total extracts of Neurospora protein were separated on the gel by electrophoresis. Afterward, the gel was treated to remove SDS and allow proteins in the gel to renature. The gel was then incubated in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP, washed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. If a kinase in the gel phosphorylates FRQ, it produces a band on the film. The approximate size of the kinase polypeptide can be estimated by comparison to the molecular weight markers on the gel. Several kinase reaction conditions were tested, including the addition of Ca/CaM in the reaction buffer. No kinase was found to significantly phosphorylate FRQ, except when Ca/CaM was added in the reaction mixture. Fig. 1A shows that an ∼50-kDa kinase specifically phosphorylated GST-FRQ in the presence of Ca2+ and CaM. The weak phosphorylation signals in theleft panel of Fig. 1A and in experiments with no kinase substrate (data not shown) indicate that this kinase autophosphorylated, a characteristic of all Ca/CaM-dependent kinases. Although a few other phosphorylation bands were also found by the assay, the similar intensities of signals between assays using GST or no substrate and assays using GST-FRQ suggest that these bands were most likely due to autophosphorylation of the kinases and not to phosphorylation of GST-FRQ. Fig. 1B demonstrates that the phosphorylation of GST-FRQ by this kinase required both Ca2+ and CaM, because when both were omitted (data not shown) or when Ca2+ alone was added in the reaction buffer, very little autophosphorylation and GST-FRQ phosphorylation were detected. To confirm these in-gel kinase assay results and to show that the Ca/CaM-dependent kinase activity was the major FRQ-phosphorylating kinase activity, we performed the standard solutionin vitro kinase assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2A, the presence of Ca2+ and CaM in the reaction mixture significantly increased the kinase activity phosphorylating GST-FRQ (compare lane 3 to lane 6), whereas GST was not phosphorylated under the same conditions (data not shown and Fig.8B). The majority of the kinase activity in lane 3 (−Ca/CaM) of Fig. 2A was likely due to the activation of the Ca/CaM-dependent kinase(s) by the low levels of Ca2+ and CaM present in the Neurosporaextracts, because such activity can be significantly inhibited by either BAPTA (a specific Ca2+ chelator, exhibiting a 105-fold greater affinity for Ca2+ than for Mg2+) or W-7 (a calmodulin inhibitor) (Fig. 2B). The residual kinase activity in the presence of BAPTA or W-7 probably reflects the fact that 1) some of the Ca/CaM-dependent kinase had already been activated by Ca2+ and CaM in the cell so that it was Ca/CaM-independent, and 2) other Ca/CaM-independent kinases could also phosphorylate GST-FRQ.Figure 8Inhibition of the phosphorylation of the endogenousFRQproteins byBAPTAand the ability of the purifiedCAMK-1to phosphorylate theFRQregion containing the three known phosphorylation sites in vitro.A, ATP and MgCl2 were added to the Neurospora cell extracts (2 mg/ml) to initiate the phosphorylation of the endogenous FRQ proteins. 1 or 3 mm BAPTA was added to the extracts shown in the two right lanes. After 2 h, the reactions were stopped; the extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed using FRQ antiserum. Various FRQ bands seen on the Western blot were the result of progressive FRQ phosphorylation and two alternatively translated FRQ forms (large FRQ and small FRQ) (11Garceau N. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of FRQ was monitored by observing the mobility shifts of the lower molecular weight FRQ species compared with the higher molecular weight species. 0 indicates theNeurospora extracts at the beginning of the reaction. Thearrow points to one of the large FRQ forms that was hypophosphorylated before the reaction. B, aliquots of the CaM column fractions (Fig. 3) were used in the in vitrokinase assay to examine the ability of the CAMK-1 to phosphorylate the small FRQ region containing the three known phosphorylation sites. GST-PO4 was the substrate used in the assay. The reaction mixtures were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. The arrowindicates the position of the full-length GST-PO4 protein. Inlane 1, 10 µg of Neurospora extracts was used. Less than 0.1 µg of purified CAMK-1 was used in lanes 2–4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Together, these results suggest that the 50-kDa Ca/CaM-dependent kinase was the only kinase that significantly phosphorylated FRQ in the in-gel kinase assay, and the Ca/CaM-dependent kinase activity was responsible for most of the kinase activity phosphorylating FRQ in vitro. If the potential FRQ kinase is Ca/CaM-dependent, it should bind CaM in the presence of Ca2+, and its activity should be enriched by passing theNeurospora extracts through a CaM affinity column. After binding the Neurospora cell extracts onto a CaM affinity column, proteins were eluted by buffers containing EGTA. The results of both the in-gel kinase assay and the in vitro kinase assay showed that the 50-kDa kinase activity was indeed greatly enriched (data not shown and Fig. 3). The ability for this kinase to bind to CaM affinity column further confirmed that it was Ca/CaM-dependent. In addition, the CaM affinity column provided a powerful step for the biochemical purification of this protein. By using both in-gel and in vitro kinase assays to monitor the kinase activity and a combination of ion exchange columns and CaM affinity column purification (see “Experimental Procedures”), we purified this kinase to near-homogeneity from Neurosporacell extracts. Silver staining of the SDS-PAGE of the protein fractions from the final CaM column showed that only two closely separated protein bands could be seen at around 50 kDa (Fig. 3, upper panel). The protein of the lower band (∼48 kDa) appeared to bind the CaM column more strongly than the protein in the upper band (∼50 kDa), because the majority of the 48-kDa protein only eluted from the column by 1 m NaCl, 5 mm EGTA. Because the kinase activity profile of different CaM column fractions correlated with the protein profiles of both proteins (Fig. 3) and their molecular weights were very close to what we expected, both proteins were potential kinase candidates. To reveal the identities of both proteins, protein fractions were concentrated, separated by SDS-PAGE gel, and Coomassie-stained. Both bands were cut out and subjected to tryptic digestion, and the resulting peptides were subjected to mass spectral analysis. The resulting mass spectral results were used to search the existing protein data bases for matching proteins. Twenty four peptides from the tryptic digestion of the 50-kDa protein were found to match theNeurospora elongation factor 1-α (45% coverage) (33Ichi-ishi A. Inoue H. Jpn. J. Genet. 1995; 70: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whereas a few peptides from the tryptic digestion of the 48-kDa protein also matched the Neurospora elongation factor 1-α (probably due to the contamination of the 50-kDa protein), the majority of the resolved peptides of the 48-kDa protein did not match any protein in the data bases. The predicted molecular mass and pI of the Neurospora elongation factor 1-α were 49.7 kDa and 9.27, respectively, in close agreement with the results of the ion exchange column purification and the protein size on SDS-PAGE. In addition, elongation factor 1-α from other organisms has been found to bind to CaM (34Numata O. Kurasawa Y. Gonda K. Watanabe Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Rasmussen C. Wiebe C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, no known Ca/CaM-dependent protein kinase activity has ever been found to be associated with elongation factor 1-α. Because no known Neurospora Ca/CaM-dependent kinase was present in the protein data bases, to identify the 48-kDa protein, we searched the existing Neurospora EST data base for a putative Ca/CaM-dependent kinase. Two EST sequences of the same gene (SM1H12T3 and SM1C1T3) (36Nelson M.A. Kang S. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Dolan P.L. Leonard P.M. Mitchell J. Armijo A.M. Bean L. Blueyes E. Cushing T. Errett A. Fleharty M. Gorman M. Judson K. Miller R. Ortega J. Pavlova I. Perea J. Todisco S. Trujillo R. Valentine J. Wells A. Werner-Washburne M. Natvig D.O. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were found to resemble other eukaryotic Ca/CaM-dependent kinases. By using the DNA sequence information of the ESTs, the full-length genomic DNA for the gene (camk-1) was cloned and sequenced. The predicted protein sequence of CAMK-1 was then used to compare with the mass spectral results of the 48-kDa protein, and we found that 27 peptides of the tryptic digestion of the 48-kDa protein matched CAMK-1, a coverage of 59.5%. The high coverage rate indicates that the purified 48-kDa protein is CAMK-1. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences of the Neurospora camk-1 revealed that it contained 6 exons and 5 introns (Fig.4A), encoding a protein of 415 aa with a predicted molecular mass and pI of 46.7 kDa and 7.7, respectively. The predicted molecular mass and pI of CAMK-1 were in close agreement with our purification profiles. Protein sequence alignment show that the Neurospora CAMK-1 is very similar to other eukaryotic Ca/CaM-dependent kinases (Fig.4B), and its closest homologs are a Ca/CaM-dependent protein kinase of Aspergillus nidulans (71% identity and 81% similarity over the first 390 aa) and the CMK2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (53% identity and 71% similarity over the first 320 aa). Like other Ca/CaM-dependent kinases, the catalytic domain (the ∼300-aa N-terminal region) of the Neurospora CAMK-1 is highly conserved, and the regulatory domain (C-terminal part of the protein) of the kinase is diverged.

The generation of a productive humoral response is only one of many possible outcomes; engagement of the BCR complex by antigen can induce survival, proliferation, apoptosis, clonal nonresponsiveness (anergy), or differentiation into memory B cells or plasma cells (1Goodnow C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2264-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, many factors determine which fate a B cell will choose, including the developmental stage of the B cell, the amount and form of the antigen, the microanatomical location of the B cell, and the availability of accessory cells. Somehow these factors in the extracellular milieu contribute to and alter the intracellular signal transduction pathways initiated by the BCR complex, resulting in differential gene expression and altered B cell fate. Recently the involvement of additional molecules expressed on the surface of B cells in delivering these extracellular cues and regulating the quality and/or quantity of BCR-initiated signals has become evident (2Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev.

These coreceptors, which include CD22, CD19, CD21, FcγRIIb, and CD72, regulate many signal transduction pathways in both “positive” and “negative” manners, thereby facilitating a range of B cell responses (2Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike receptor tyrosine kinases, the BCR has no intrinsic kinase. Engagement of the BCR rapidly recruits and activates protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), which initiate perhaps all of the downstream biochemical events after antigen receptor stimulation (2Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kurosaki T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Three major families of PTKs are expressed in B cells: Lyn, Blk, Fyn, Lck, and Fgr of the Src family; Syk of the Syk/Zap70 family; and Btk of the Tec family (2Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kurosaki T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Activation of these kinases leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of various substrates, including coreceptors, adaptor molecules, and other enzymes (8DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of coreceptors produces potential binding sites for downstream signaling molecules and promotes the formation of signaling complexes at the lipid bilayer juxtaposed to potential substrates. CD22 is a B cell-restricted type I surface glycoprotein (3Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9Law C.L.

Immunity. 1997; 6: 509-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The extracellular portion of CD22 contains seven immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. The two amino-terminal Ig-like domains are capable of binding ligands with α2→6-linked sialic acid moieties expressed on epithelial, endothelial, B, and T cells (3Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, the specific ligands recognized by CD22 in vivo are not yet well defined (3Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of CD22 contains six conserved tyrosine residues, some or all of which are rapidly phosphorylated upon engagement of the BCR (11Schulte R.J. Campbell M.A. Fischer W.H.

By recruiting various signaling molecules to the BCR complex, CD22 may regulate BCR-mediated signal transduction pathways and B cell function. This hypothesis is supported by evidence from studies of CD22-deficient mice. Although cd22 −/− mice develop relatively normal numbers of peripheral B cells, cd22 −/−B cells have an abnormal surface phenotype: they have decreased expression of surface IgM (sIgM) and elevated expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, indicative of B cells that have encountered antigen in vivo (22Otipoby K.L.

In agreement with a so-called “hyper-responsive” phenotype, engagement of the BCR on cd22 −/− B cells leads to greater increases in levels of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) compared with wild-type B cells (22Otipoby K.L. Andersson K.B. Draves K.E. Klaus S.J. Farr A.G. Kerner J.D. Perlmutter R.M. Law C.L. Clark E.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 23O'Keefe T.L. Williams G.T.

Based on these data it has been proposed that CD22 functions primarily as a negative regulator of BCR signal transduction (18Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L.

However, B cells from CD22-deficient mice proliferate less well compared with wild-type B cells when treated with the same reagent that leads to augmented release of [Ca2+]i (22Otipoby K.L.

How CD22 might regulate B cell responses in both a positive and a negative manner has remained an enigma. We have looked at the role that single tyrosine residues play in the recruitment of signaling proteins and the role that CD22 plays in activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Here we present data suggesting that the cytoplasmic tail of CD22 contains two signaling domains that regulate signal transduction pathways initiated by the BCR. These findings may explain the paradoxical phenotype of CD22-deficient mice. cd22 +/− mice, which had been backcrossed to C57Bl/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) greater than seven generations, were crossed to generate cd22 +/+ and cd22 −/−mice (22Otipoby K.L.

Litter- and gender-matched, 7–12-week-old cd22 +/+ and cd22 −/−mice were used for all of the mouse studies. All mice were raised in the specific pathogen-free facility at the University of Washington. Mice were genotyped for the wild-type and mutant alleles of cd22 by subjecting tail DNA to three PCRs. Briefly, one forward primer that annealed in intron 2 (27Law C.L. Torres R.M. Sundberg H.A. Parkhouse R.M. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Clark E.A. J.

The PCRs generated a 207-base pair fragment from the wild-type allele with primers that annealed in intron 2/intron 3, a 342-base pair fragment from the mutant allele with primers that annealed in intron 2/neomycin, and 829- and 1309-base pair fragments from wild-type and mutant alleles, respectively, with primers that annealed in intron 2/intron 4.

Six mutant constructs that contained single tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations were generated from pcDNAmCD22-HA (16Law C.L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Zhao Z. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a full-length cDNA of murine cd22 in pcDNA-3 with a 3′EcoRI site, HA tag, stop codon, and XhoI site replacing the natural stop codon. Forward primers with the indicated mutation (Y773F, 5′-CAG GGA TGC TTC AAT CCG GCA-3′; Y783F, 5′-ACT GTT AGT TTT GCC ATC TTG-3′; Y817F, 5′-ACG GTC ACT TTC TCG GTG ATA-3′; Y828F, 5′-ATG GGG GAT TTT GAG AAT GTG-3′; Y843F, 5′-AGC ATC CAT TTC TCA GAG CTG-3′; and Y863F, 5′-GAC GTA GAC TTT GTG ACC CTC-3′) were used with the commercially available Sp6 reverse primer to generate six mutant fragments by PCR mutagenesis. After purifying the PCR products corresponding to the six mutated 3′-regions of cd22, another set of PCRs with pcDNAmCD22-HA as the template was set up using the mutated fragments, a forward primer that bound the 5′-end of pcDNAmCD22-HA (5′-GAT CGG ATC CGC GGC CTG GGA GAG AAA TAG CAG-3′), and the Sp6 reverse primer. Amplified full-length, HA-tagged wild-type or mutant murine cd22 cDNA products were then ligated into pcDNA3 after digesting both the PCR fragments and the vector with BamHI and XhoI. Since the HA tag encodes three tyrosine residues, it was removed and replaced with a c-myc tag and stop codon in each of the wild type and six mutants by setting up seven triple-ligation reactions, each containing the purified, untagged insert from BamHI- and EcoRI-digested wild-type or mutant HA-tagged cd22, EcoRI- and XhoI-digested c-myc tag/stop codon (generated by annealing 5′-TCG AGT TAC AAC AAG TCC TCT TCA GAA ATG AGC TTT TGC TCC TCT GCG-3′ and 5′-AAT TCG CAG AGG AGC AAA AGC TCA TTT CTG AAG AGG ACT TGT TGT AAC-3′), and BamHI- and XhoI-digested pcDNA3.

After digesting the PCR fragment with SalI, it was cloned into SalI-digested pApuro-2. The pApuro-2-mCD22 construct was verified by restriction and sequence analysis. BJAB B cells in exponential phase were washed twice in electroporation medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids, and 2 mml-glutamine) and resuspended at 3 × 107 ml−1. Next, 350 μl of the cell suspension was placed in a 0.4-cm cuvette with 50 μg of linearized plasmid DNA containing c-myc-tagged wild-type or mutant cd22 inserts in pcDNA-3 for 10 min on ice. Cells were then electroporated (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with Capacitance Extender) at 230 V and 960 microfarads. After electroporation, cells were placed on ice for 10 min, resuspended in 20 ml of electroporation medium, and cultured at 37 °C. After 2 days, Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to final concentration of 3 mg ml−1. After ∼2 weeks, cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Clones were screened for similar expression levels of wild-type or mutant murine CD22 by surface staining with biotinylated anti-CD22 (2D6) and flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Stable transfectants were then maintained in 1 mg ml−1 Geneticin. Wild-type and mutant DT40 cells in exponential phase were washed once in RPMI 1640 medium. DT40 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of linearized plasmid DNA containing pApuro-2-mCD22 at 290 V and 960 microfarads and cultured as described above for transfection in BJAB cells. After 2 days, puromycin (Sigma) was added at 0.5 μg ml−1. Five days later, dead cells were removed by centrifugation over IsoPrep (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells at the interface were washed twice and cultured at 37 °C. Cells were later stained for surface expression of murine CD22 with biotinylated CD22 mAb, sorted by a FACS (FACS Vantage Turbo S.E., Becton Dickinson) for high expression of CD22, and cloned by limiting dilution. Clones were screened and selected for similar expression levels of CD22. Cells in exponential phase were centrifuged and resuspended at 107 ml−1 in RP10. Cells were activated for the indicated number of minutes at 37 °C with 10 μg ml−1 of the indicated antiserum or mAb. Activation was stopped by the addition of at least 5 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 30 × 106 ml−1 in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 μg ml−1 aprotinin, 1 μg ml−1 pepstatin A, 1 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mmNa3PO4, and 100 μg ml−1 soybean trypsin inhibitor) for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm to remove nuclei, lysates were used for immunoprecipitations with the indicated mAb. Lysates with mAbs were incubated at 4 °C overnight with constant rotation. Samples were rotated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of packed protein A- or protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, mixed with 100 μl of 1× reducing sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1.25% SDS, 12% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and frozen at −70 °C until used for SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on either a 12- or 20-cm 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nylon membrane. Membranes were washed in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), blocked in TBST-B (TBST with 5% bovine serum albumin) overnight, subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antiserum or mAb and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody, and visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometry was performed, and values were normalized against either Mst-1, for blots of whole cell lysates, or CD22, for blots of CD22 immunoprecipitations.In vitro kinase reactions were performed as described previously (31Jiang A. Craxton A. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of CD22 contains six conserved tyrosine residues and becomes rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following BCR engagement (11Schulte R.J. Campbell M.A. Fischer W.H. Sefton B.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Stamenkovic I. Seed B. Nature. 1990; 345: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Wilson G.L. Fox C.H.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 2641-2649PubMed Google Scholar). Three of these tyrosines, Tyr-783, Tyr-843, and Tyr-863 (numbering is based on the unprocessed murine CD22 protein), are located within ITIM motifs as defined by the consensus motif (V/L/I)XY XX(L/I/V) (where X is any amino acid) (32Thomas M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1953-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When the tyrosine residue within an ITIM motif is phosphorylated, the ITIM motif can bind molecules such as the SHP-1 protein tyrosine phosphatase and potentially play a role in activating SHP-1 (16Law C.L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Zhao Z. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Using phosphopeptides equivalent to the six tyrosine-containing regions in CD22, it was previously reported that phosphopeptides corresponding to the three ITIM motifs of CD22 can compete with CD22 for the binding of SHP-1, whereas the analogous nonphosphorylated peptides do not (18Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These data suggested that Tyr-783, Tyr-843, and Tyr-863 were involved in the binding and activation of SHP-1 but did not clarify which of these tyrosines was required in vivo for recruitment of SHP-1 to CD22 following engagement of the BCR. To address this question, we used the sIgM-positive human B cell line BJAB to generate a stable transfectant expressing c-Myc-tagged wild-type murine CD22 and six stable transfectants expressing mutant forms of c-Myc-tagged murine CD22 with single tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations. All seven stable lines were selected for similar expression levels of the transfected wild-type or mutant murine CD22 molecules (Fig. 1 A). This system had several advantages relative to other transfection systems. Unlike non-B cell lines where CD22 has been studied, e.g. HeLa cells (33Blasioli J. Paust S. Thomas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2303-2307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), BJAB contains the same or very similar signal transduction machinery present in normal B cells. Also, the upstream and downstream components of the signal transduction machinery are present and at unmanipulated levels. Furthermore, BCR cross-linking, a relatively physiological stimulus, was used instead of pharmacological reagents to activate the B cells. Finally, the transfected BJAB lines express endogenous human CD22, which was used as an internal positive control for recruitment of SHP-1 and was easily distinguishable from the transfected wild-type or mutant murine CD22 by specific mAbs and antisera. Stimulation through the BCR on transfectants expressing wild-type murine CD22 led to efficient association of SHP-1 with both the transfected murine CD22 and endogenous human CD22 (Fig. 1 B). This was also observed for four of the six transfectants expressing different mutant forms of murine CD22. Transfectants with single tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at position 773, 783, 817, or 828 (Y773F, Y783F, Y817F, or Y828F, respectively) efficiently recruited SHP-1 to both the mutant murine CD22 molecules and the endogenous human CD22 in response to BCR cross-linking (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Thus, although a phosphopeptide of the “ITIM tyrosine” Tyr-783 blocked SHP-1 binding (18Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Tyr-783 was not required for BCR-induced SHP-1 recruitment in vivo. However, after normalizing for the amount of immunoprecipitated CD22, we found that single tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at position 843 (Y843F) or 863 (Y863F) decreased the amount of SHP-1 recruited to CD22 by 90 and 97%, respectively, compared with the amount bound by wild-type CD22 (Fig. 1 B). The endogenous human CD22 in these same cells maintained its ability to recruit SHP-1 (Fig.1 B). Thus, the upstream kinases required for phosphorylation of CD22 and recruitment of SHP-1 were not altered during"

Here, we evaluated the effects of different heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-expressing cell lines and HSPGs derived from these cells on FGF2-induced FGFR1-phosphorylation in heparan sulfate-negative BaF3 cells. HSPGs supplied in membrane-associated form, by presenting cells, were all effective promotors of FGF2-initiated FGFR1 phosphorylation, independently of their nature (syndecan/glypican) or cellular origin (human lung fibroblasts, transfected Namalwa cells, or transfected K562 cells). A treatment with heparitinase initially stimulated, but finally completely inhibited, the activity of these presenting cells. In comparison, equivalent amounts of soluble HSPGs, obtained by trypsinization of these cells or by immunopurification from cell extracts, did not promote FGF2-induced FGFR1-phosphorylation, yet removal of the less anionic species or a further treatment with heparitinase converted these soluble fractions into potent activators of FGF2/FGFR1 signaling. Extrapolating from current structural models, we suggest that FGFR dimerization and autophosphorylation is supported by cooperative “heparin-like end structures,” and that cell surface association and concentration compensate for the relative scarcity of such end structures in native HSPGs. In this model, “proteolytic” shedding of heparan sulfate would act as a diluting, down-regulatory mechanism, while “heparanolytic” shedding might act as an up-regulatory mechanism, by increasing the concentration of these end structures.

HSPGs are associated with the cell surface of many, if not most, cell types. Most known HSPG functions are contributed by the interactions of the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of these molecules. Besides growth factors, these HSPGs interact with various adhesion molecules, protease inhibitors, and enzymes, modifying the spatial distributions and activities of these ligands. Among FGFs, the interaction with FGF2 has been studied most intensively, and it is now generally accepted that HSPGs play important roles in FGF2 signaling. Initially, the association of FGF2 with HS has been proposed to protect this FGF from proteolysis and thermal denaturation (1Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Vlodavsky I. Miao H.Q. Medalion B. Danagher P. Ron D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and to serve as a reservoir of growth factor that can be released by enzymes that degrade the proteoglycans (1Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Later, HSPGs were identified as co-receptors for FGF2, strongly promoting FGF-FGFR binding and the subsequent activation of the receptor (3Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 4Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Recently, genetic studies in Drosophila provided compelling evidence that HSPGs are essential for FGF signaling in vivo (5Lin X. Buff E.M. Perrimon N. Michelson A.M. Development. 1999; 126: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the importance of HSPG in FGF-signaling is well documented, the nature of the “co-receptor” and the precise mechanisms at work are less well characterized. Distinctive core protein structures define two major families of cell surface-associated HSPGs: syndecans and glypicans (6David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Prior work from our laboratory showed that syndecans and glypican-1 stimulate FGF2-FGFR1 interaction and signaling in K562 cells, at least when co-expressed with receptor in these cells (4Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This agrees with the work of other groups, showing that cell surface syndecan-1 from Raji cells acts as a positive regulator of FGF2 binding and signaling (7Filla M.S. Dam P. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), that syndecan-2 on human macrophages promotes FGF2-mediated proliferation (8Clasper S. Vekemans S. Fiore M. Plebanski M. Wordsworth P. David G. Jackson D.G. J. Biol.

Syndecans and glypican-1 purified from human lung fibroblast extracts are unable to promote high affinity binding of FGF2 to FGFR1 (11Aviezer D. Levy E. Safran M. Svahn C. Buddecke E. Schmidt A. David G. Vlodavsky I. Yayon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 114-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), overexpression of syndecan-1 in NIH 3T3 cells inhibits FGF2-induced proliferation (12Mali M. Elenius K. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24215-24222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HSPGs purified from endothelial secretions prevent FGF2 binding to vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibit FGF2-induced mitogenesis (13Forsten K.E. Courant N.A. Nugent M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the HSPGs were from different sources and might have had different compositions. It is well known, indeed, that the fine structure of HS is cell- and differentiation-specific, and highly diverse (14Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the membrane association of HSPG might play a role in promoting FGF2 signaling, since most of the inhibitory effects of HSPGs reported so far relate to soluble forms. Syndecans and glypicans are constitutively shed from cultured cells (16Mertens G. Van der Schueren B. van den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and shed soluble syndecan ectodomains can also be found in inflammatory fluid (18Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), where they appear to act as inhibitors of FGF2 (19Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Finally, sometimes different end point analyses were used as a measure of receptor activity. In the present study, we attempted to define the relative importance of these variables. We used FGF2-induced FGFR1 autophosphorylation as an end point and tested the activities of HSPGs from different origins, both in soluble and in membrane-associated form. Clones encoding FGFR1 were isolated from a human embryonic lung fibroblast λ ZAPII phage library (4Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The cDNA of the IgII/IIIc isoform of FGFR1 was used as a polymerase chain reaction template. The primer 5′-CGGGATCCAGGCCGTCCCCGACCTTGCCT was designed to introduce a BamHI restriction site at the 5′-end. The BamHI-SpeI fragment of this FGFR1 cDNA was blunted at the SpeI site and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pDisplay (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), using the compatible BglII and SmaI sites, to produce an N-terminal hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope-tagged version of this receptor. The cDNAs for syndecan-1 (20Mali M. Jaakkola P. Arvilommi A.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6884-6889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glypican-1 (21David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) were cloned into the episomal expression vector pREP4 (Invitrogen), using the KpnI and NheI sites and the HindIII and NotI sites, respectively. The same cDNAs were also cloned in pcDNA3/neo, using the KpnI and NotI and HindIII and XbaI sites, respectively. Chain valence mutants of glypican-1 were generated with the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The primer (and corresponding antisense primer) 5′-GACGACGGCAGCGGCTCGGGCGCCGGTGATGGCTG was used to generate the two-chain form (changing Ser488 into Ala488). The primer (and corresponding antisense primer) 5′-GACGACGGCAGCGGCGCGGGCGCCGGTGATGGCTG was used to generate the single chain form (changing Ser488 into Ala488 and Ser490 into Ala490). The HindIII–XbaI fragments of the mutant cDNAs, blunted at the XbaI sites, were cloned into the episomal expression vector pREP4 (Invitrogen), using the HindIII and blunted XhoI site. BaF3 cells (generously provided by Dr. D. M. Ornitz) were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) and 10% WEHI cell-conditioned medium (as a source of murine interleukin-3). Before transfection, cells were washed with calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For transfection, 1 × 107 cells were incubated with 30 μg of linearized HA-FGFR1-pDisplay or pDisplay plasmid in 0.5 ml of calcium/magnesium-free PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were then electroporated at 350 V and 960 microfarads (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad). After 24–48 h of cell culture, selection was started with 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). Two weeks later, stable clones were obtained, and subclones were established after 1 month. Individual clones were tested for HA-FGFR1 expression as described under “Western Blotting.” One of the highest expressors, clone B6, was selected for further experiments. Namalwa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, 1 × 107 cells were incubated with 30 μg of linearized syndecan-1-pcDNA/neo, glypican-1-pcDNA/neo, or pcDNA/neo plasmid in 0.5 ml of calcium/magnesium-free PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were then electroporated at 240 V and 960 microfarads. Selection was started 24–48 h later, with 1.5 mg/ml G418. Stable transfection was achieved after 2 weeks. The selected population was characterized by quantitative immunofluorescence flow cytometry, using HS and core protein-specific antibodies (see below). K562 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, 5 × 106 cells were incubated with 30 μg of syndecan-1-pREP4, glypican-1-pREP4, or pREP4 plasmid in 0.5 ml of calcium/magnesium-free PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then electroporated at 250 V and 960 microfarads. Selection with hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 200 μg/ml resulted in stable cell populations that were not further subcloned. The population was characterized by quantitative immunofluorescence flow cytometry, using HS and core protein-specific antibodies. Transfections with pRep4 vectors encoding one-chain (SAA), two-chain (SSA), and wild type (SSS) forms of glypican-1 into Namalwa cells were performed in similar ways. Namalwa cells or K562 cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml 10E4 (monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizing HS) or the core protein-specific antibodies BB4 (mAb recognizing syndecan-1; Serotec Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom) and S1 (mAb recognizing glypican-1). After 1 h at 4 °C, the cells were washed with PBS plus 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated for another 1 h at 4 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies (Nordic Immunology, Tilburg, The Netherlands). Cells were washed again with PBS plus 2% BSA and fixed with formaldehyde. The fluorescence was measured with a FACSort (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The value obtained for cells that were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies only was taken as background fluorescence. Proteins were extracted from cells with lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 mm NaF). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 15 min. Supernatants were subjected to 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then transferred for 3 h at 0.5 A to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% I-block (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and 0.01% Tween, at 37 °C for 1 h and incubated with the anti-HA mAb 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HA-FGFR1 was visualized by chemiluminescence, using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HA-FGFR1 was extracted from BaF3 B6 cells with lysis buffer. Total cell lysate was presorbed with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The supernatant was incubated with the anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (10 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complex was collected by further incubation with protein A beads at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with lysis buffer and PBS, the beads were incubated with 0.5 milliunits of endoglycosidase H, 1 unit of N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or only assay buffer at 37 °C overnight. Then the protein A beads were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer in the presence of 10 mmdithiothreitol. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. mAb 3F10 was used to detect the HA-FGFR1 in Western blotting. HA-FGFR1-transfected or sham-transfected BaF3 cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were washed and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin for another 20 min at 4 °C. After three washes with cold PBS, cells were lysed with lysis buffer. Streptavidin beads were added to the cell lysate to capture all biotinylated proteins. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the streptavidin beads were washed and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer in the presence of dithiothreitol. Both the biotinylated and nonbiotinylated fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes. mAb 3F10 was used to detect the HA-FGFR1 in Western blotting. BaF3 B6 cells were serum-starved in RPMI medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA and 2% WEHI cell-conditioned medium. After 2 days of starvation, 2 ng/ml FGF2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to cells in HEPES-buffered medium (RPMI medium, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mm orthovanadate), in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml heparin (Calbiochem), at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Then the cells were warmed up at 37 °C for 5–30 min and extracted with lysis buffer in the presence of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (1 mmorthovanadate). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated with PY-20 (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody)-conjugated protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer in the presence of dithiothreitol. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes. HA-FGFR1 was detected with mAb 3F10. For testing the effects of membrane-associated HSPGs on FGF2-induced HA-FGFR1 phosphorylation, 3 × 106 B6 cells were incubated with 1 × 106 HSPG-presenting cells (fetal human lung fibroblasts; syndecan-1-transfected, glypican-1-transfected, or sham-transfected K562 cells; or transfected Namalwa cells) in the presence of FGF2 at 4 °C for 1.5 h. To remove the cell surface HS, cells were treated with 0.01 units/ml heparinase (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 40 min. Treated cells were incubated with B6 cells and FGF2 and analyzed as described above. For analyzing the time course of the effect of a heparitinase digestion, cells were incubated with 0.006 units/ml heparitinase (Seikagaku) for 2, 5, 10, or 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with assay buffer (HEPES-buffered medium) and then mixed with B6 cells in the presence of FGF2. The phosphorylation of HA-FGFR1 was assayed as described above. To test the soluble forms of these HSPGs, HSPG-presenting cells were treated with 100 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma) at 4 °C for 10 min. Trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) was then added to quench the effect of trypsin. Further treatment with 0.006 units/ml heparitinase was performed at 37 °C for 40 min. Soluble HS chains or chain clusters prepared from immunopurified syndecan-1 or glypican-1 (see below) were incubated with B6 cells in the presence of FGF2, and tested as described above. Cell surface proteoglycans were extracted from fetal human lung fibroblasts, syndecan-1- or glypican-1-transfected K562 cells, and transfected Namalwa cells as described previously (4Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7009-7016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with [35S]sulfate and lysed with a Triton X-100 buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors. The cell extract was then centrifuged and concentrated on a DEAE-Trisacryl M column (Life Technologies). Proteoglycans were immunopurified with specific mAb, immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After further purification by ion exchange chromatography on a RESOURCE Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Triton-urea-Tris buffer, these HSPGs were treated with chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) (20 milliunits/ml, 3 h at 37 °C). Soluble HS fractions were obtained from these HSPGs by trypsin digestion (60 μg/ml, 30 min at 37 °C) or alkaline treatment (0.5 m KOH, overnight at 4 °C). All treated proteoglycan fractions were repurified on DEAE beads. Heparitinase digestion (0.015 units/ml) was at 37 °C for 3 h. To test the effects of heparin or HSPGs on receptor activation, a low to zero background of endogenous HSPG expression is required. BaF3 cells express no detectable levels of endogenous HSPG. These cells also cannot be induced to express any heparan sulfate upon transfection with relevant core protein cDNAs, which excludes their use for the design of receptor and HSPG co-transfection experiments. However, several reports suggest that cell surface HSPGs can mediate FGF2 binding to an FGFR that is expressed on neighboring cells and induce the signaling of this receptor (7Filla M.S. Dam P. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Richard C. Liuzzo J.P. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24188-24196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We hence developed tools for measuring such “transactivation” of the FGFR, using receptor-autophosphorylation as assay. BaF3 cells transfected with an HA epitope-tagged human FGFR1 IgII/IIIc isoform were constructed to act as FGFR1-presenting cells. Namalwa and K562 cells, transfected with syndecan-1 or glypican-1 cDNAs, and fetal human lung fibroblasts, which express high levels of endogenous syndecans and glypican-1, were chosen to act as HSPG-presenting cells. The expression of HA-FGFR1 in the BaF3 cells was confirmed by Western blotting. HA-FGFR1 appeared as two bands migrating around 100 and 120 kDa. The predicted molecular mass of this HA-FGFR1 is 81.5 kDa, and glycosidase susceptibility tests indicated that the 120-kDa (endoglycosidase H-resistant) and 100-kDa (endoglycosidase H-susceptible) forms represented two different isoforms of glycosylated receptor (both N-glycosidase F-susceptible) (Fig. 1 A). Cell surface biotinylation revealed that the majority of the cell surface-exposed HA-FGFR consisted of the 120-kDa isoform (Fig. 1 B). HA-FGFR1-transfected BaF3 cells were cloned, and one of the highest expressors, clone B6, was chosen for further experiments. Clone B6 and sham-transfected BaF3 cells were then incubated with or without FGF2 in the presence or absence of heparin, and the phosphorylation of HA-FGFR1 was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” (anti-Tyr(P) pull-down; blotting with anti-HA). Clearly, the phosphorylation (pull-down) of HA-FGFR1 in BaF3 cells was strictly dependent upon the addition of both FGF-2 and heparin (Fig. 2 A). A time course experiment showed that FGFR1 autophosphorylation reached peak levels around 15 min of exposure to ligand at 37 °C (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2FGFR1-phosphorylation in BaF3 cells. A, FGF2 and heparin dependence. Receptor-transfected (B6) and sham-transfected (pDisplay) BaF3 cells were serum-starved. Aliquots of 3 × 106 cells were incubated with or without 2 ng/ml FGF2, in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml heparin at 4 °C. Cells were warmed up at 37 °C and then lysed. The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY-20 was used to precipitate all of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins present in the lysates. The immunoprecipitates and supernatants were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. HA-FGFR1 was detected with mAb 3F10. The autophosphorylation of HA-FGFR1 is clearly dependent on the addition of both FGF2 and heparin. C, control; F, FGF2;H, heparin; FH, FGF2 plus heparin; IP, PY20 immunoprecipitate, represents phosphorylated FGFR1; SN, supernatant, represents unphosphorylated FGFR1. B, kinetics of FGF2-induced FGFR1 phosphorylation. After incubation with FGF2 and heparin at 4 °C, the cells were warmed up at 37 °C for 5–30 min, as indicated, and analyzed as above. FGFR1 autophosphorylation reaches the highest level around 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cultured human lung fibroblasts accumulate large amounts of syndecans, glypican-1, and perlecan on their cell surfaces (22Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7009-7016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Namalwa and K562 cells, in contrast, express very low to low levels of endogenous cell surface HSPG, mainly glypican-1 (in Namalwa cells) and syndecans (in K562 cells) (4Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Phorbol diester-stimulated K562 cells secrete significant amounts of perlecan into their culture media (24Grassel S. Cohen I.R. Murdoch A.D. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 145: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but under basic conditions only very little of this proteoglycan can be detected on the surfaces of these cells (result not shown). To construct cells that express only or primarily a single major form of proteoglycan, both the Namalwa and K562 cell lines were transfected with syndecan-1 or glypican-1 cDNA. The expression levels of cell surface syndecan-1 and glypican-1 proteoglycan were monitored by quantitative immunofluorescence flow cytometry, using the HS-specific mAb 10E4 and protein-specific antibodies. In all HSPG-transfected cells, the expression of cell surface HS was markedly increased, by at least 1 order of magnitude. The protein-specific antibodies BB4 and S1 confirmed the expression of cell surface syndecan-1 and glypican-1, respectively (Fig. 3). HA-FGFR1-transfected BaF3 cells (clone B6) were then incubated with HSPG-presenting cells in the presence of FGF2 and assessed for autophosphorylation of HA-FGFR1. Fig. 4shows that, independently of their origin, all membrane-associated HSPGs (transfectant syndecan-1 and glypican-1 in the case of Namalwa or K562 cells and total cell surface HSPGs in the case of fetal human lung fibroblasts) markedly enhanced the FGF2-dependent phosphorylation of HA-FGFR1. In contrast, K562 or Namalwa cells that had been treated with heparinase or transfected with empty vectors had no significant effects on FGFR1 autophosphorylation. This confirmed that the effects of these HSPG-presenting cells on FGFR1 phosphorylation were HSPG-dependent. Interestingly, treating the HSPG- presenting cells with heparitinase instead of heparinase, for increasing lengths of time, first increased and then decreased the capacity of these cells to support FGF2-induced receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 5).Figure 5Effect of heparitinase on HSPG-presenting cells. Syndecan-1-transfected Namalwa cells were treated with heparitinase at 37 °C for different lengths of time, as indicated. Aliquots of 1 × 106 digested cells were washed with assay buffer and mixed with aliquots of 3 × 106 B6 cells in the presence of FGF2. Phosphorylated HA-FGFR1 was detected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Heparitinase transiently enhances activity. Symbols are as in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous reports had demonstrated that purified syndecans and glypican-1 originating from cultured fetal human lung fibroblasts could not assist FGF2 in high affinity receptor binding (11Aviezer D.

Nevertheless, in the present assay, cell-associated forms of these HSPGs were able to promote FGF2-induced receptor phosphorylation. To test whether this membrane association played a significant role, the HSPG-presenting cells were treated with trypsin. Trypsin would be predicted to cleave the core proteins of these proteoglycans and to release the ectodomain and ectodomain fragments that bear the HS chains into medium. Analysis of the residual HSPG expression by quantitative immunofluorescence flow cytometry confirmed that after trypsinization, barely any HSPG remained on the cell surface (data not shown). The supernatants of these trypsin digestions (containing the released HSPG) were supplemented with trypsin inhibitor and then added to the HA-FGFR1-transfected B6 cells in the presence of FGF2. The soluble forms of these HSPGs all failed to enhance FGF2-induced HA-FGFR1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). To ensure that no HS had been lost during the collection of the supernatants, trypsinized HSPG-presenting cells and supernatants were also left together, supplemented with trypsin inhibitor, and added to the B6 cells. None of these recombinations stimulated FGF2-induced receptor phosphorylation (data not shown). Furthermore, when non-trypsin-treated HSPG-presenting cells were mixed with soluble HS, obtained by trypsinizing the equivalent of 10 times more cells, no significant phosphorylation of HA-FGFR1 could be detected in the"

Ligation of CD40 alone by either cross-linking antibodies against CD40 or a recombinant CD40 ligand (CD154) was unable to induce the production of NO in BV-2 microglial cells. The absence of induction of NO production by CD40 ligation alone even in CD40-overexpressed BV-2 microglial cells suggests that a signal transduced by the ligation of CD40 alone is not sufficient to induce NO production. However, CD40 ligation markedly stimulated interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-mediated NO production. Ligation of CD40 in CD40-overexpressed cells further stimulated IFN-γ-induced production of NO. This stimulation of NO production was accompanied by stimulation of the iNOS protein and mRNA. In addition to BV-2 glial cells, CD40 ligation also stimulated IFN-γ-mediated NO production in mouse primary microglia and peritoneal macrophages. To understand the mechanism of induction/stimulation of iNOS, we investigated the roles of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), transcription factors responsible for the induction of iNOS. IFN-γ alone was able to induce the activation of NF-κB as well as C/EBPβ. However, CD40 ligation alone induced the activation of only NF-κB but not of C/EBPβ, suggesting that the activation of NF-κB alone by CD40 ligation is not sufficient to induce the expression of iNOS and that the activation of C/EBPβ is also necessary for the expression of iNOS. Consistently, dominant-negative mutants of p65 (Δp65) and C/EBPβ (ΔC/EBPβ) inhibited the expression of iNOS in BV-2 microglial cells that were stimulated with the combination of IFN-γ and CD40 ligand. Stimulation of IFN-γ-mediated activation of NF-κB but not of C/EBPβ by CD40 ligation suggests that CD40 ligation stimulates the expression of iNOS in IFN-γ-treated BV-2 microglial cells through the stimulation of NF-κB activation. This study illustrates a novel role for CD40 ligation in stimulating the expression of iNOS in microglial cells, which may participate in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases.

Furthermore, the importance of CD40-CD40L interaction in the disease process of EAE/MS has been highlighted by the fact that administration of anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody attenuates the development of EAE (20Gerritse K.

However, the molecular events surrounding the marked increase of CD40 ligation in neural tissues of MS patients and EAE animals are not completely understood. We herein report that CD40 ligation markedly stimulates the expression of iNOS by augmenting the activation of NF-κB in IFN-γ-treated microglial cells. Fetal bovine serum, Hank's balanced salt solution, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 were from Life Technologies, Inc.l-N G-Monomethylarginine (l-NMA) andd-N G-monomethylarginine (d-NMA) were purchased from Biomol. Arginase was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS were obtained from Calbiochem. Cross-linking antibodies against CD40 were obtained from BD PharMingen. Mouse recombinant IFN-γ was obtained from R&D Systems. Human recombinant CD40L was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals.125I-labeled protein A and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The dominant-negative mutant of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), ΔC/EBPβ, was kindly provided by Dr. Steve Smale of the University of California at Los Angeles. Microglial cells were isolated from mixed glial cultures according to the procedure of Guilian and Baker (22Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, on day 7–9 the mixed glial cultures were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and subjected to shaking at 240 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C in a rotary shaker. The floating cells were washed and seeded into plastic tissue culture flasks and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The attached cells were removed by trypsinization and seeded onto new plates for further studies. Ninety to ninety-five percent of this preparation was found to be positive for Mac-1 surface antigen. For the induction of NO production, cells were stimulated with cytokines or CD40L in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12. Mouse BV-2 microglial cells (a kind gift from Virginia Bocchini of University of Perugia, Italy) were also maintained and induced with different stimuli as indicated above. Macrophages were obtained from mice by peritoneal lavage with sterile RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum (23Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 24Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Liu X. Hilger S. McKinney M. Petro T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7899-7905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Macrophages at a concentration of 4 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine and gentamicin were added in volumes of 1 ml to each well of six-well plates. After 1 h, nonadherent cells were removed by washing, and 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with various stimuli was added to the adherent cells. Murine CD40 cDNA was produced by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA isolated from murine RAW264.7 cells that were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ and 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide for 24 h. The PCR product was cloned into the pTARGET (Promega) mammalian expression vector utilizing 5′- and 3′-T overhangs according to the recommendations provided by the manufacturer. PCR amplification of CD40 cDNA was done by adding 2 μl of the cDNA with sense primer 5′-CTGCATGGTGTCTTTGCCTCGGCTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TTCAGACCAGGGGCCTCAAGGCTAT-3′ (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was carried out in 50-μl reaction volumes with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); 2 mmMgCl2; 10 mm KCl; 6 mm(NH4)2SO4; 0.1% Triton X-100; 10 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin; 0.2 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP; and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR amplifications were performed for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, and 75 °C for 2 min. The PCR reaction products were size-fractionated on 1.5% agarose, 0.5× Tris acetate/EDTA (TAE) and visualized by ethidium bromide fluorescence. A band of ∼1000 base pairs was isolated and cloned into precut pTARGET derived from the parent vector pCIneo (Promega). The CD40-pTARGET construct was used to transform competentEscherichia coli JM109. Several transformed clones were isolated, and plasmids were prepared from each clone. The sequence of the inserted DNA in several plasmid constructs, which were prepared at the core facilities of the Beadle Center for Biotechnology, University of Nebraska, confirmed the presence of CD40 cDNA in the pTARGET vector. Cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected with different concentrations of CD40 cDNA by LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol (24Pahan K. Sheikh F.G.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with cross-linking antibodies against CD40 and/or IFN-γ under serum-free conditions. After 24 h of incubation, culture supernatants were transferred to measure NO production. Synthesis of NO was determined by an assay of culture supernatants for nitrite, a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen. Briefly, 400 μl of culture supernatant was allowed to react with 200 μl of Griess reagent (27Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J.

The optical density of the assay samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Fresh culture medium served as the blank in all experiments. Nitrite concentrations were calculated from a standard curve derived from the reaction of NaNO2 in the assay. Protein was measured by the procedure of Bradford (31Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis for iNOS was carried out as described earlier (28Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T.

Briefly, cells were detached by scraping, washed with Hank's buffer, and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the iNOS band was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS and 125I-labeled protein A (27Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Singh I. J. Biol.

Cells were taken out of the culture dishes directly by adding Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analyses, 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrotransferred to Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized at 68 °C with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA probe was made by PCR amplification using two primers (forward primer, 5′-CTCCTTCAAAGAGGCAAAAATA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CACTTCCTCCAGGATGTTGT-3′) (27Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Singh I. J. Biol.

After hybridization, the filters were washed two or three times in solution I (2× SSC, 0.05% SDS) for 1 h at room temperature followed by solution II (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C for another hour. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.). The same amount of RNA was hybridized with probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The C/EBPβ-sensitive promoter was generated as follows to include four C/EBPβ binding sites. A single primer set was generated with the following sense sequence: 5′-ATAGAGCTCATACGTCACATTGCACAATCATAGAGCTCATTACGTCACATTGCACAATCATACAATACGTCACATTGCACAATCATTCATAACGTCACATTGCACAATCTAATCTCGAGTAA-3′. The antisense primer was as follows: 5′-ATACTCGAGGATTGTGCAATGTGACGTTTACTCGAGATTAGATTGTGCAATGTGACGTTATGAATGATTGTGCAATGTGACGTATTGTATGATTGTGCAATGTGACGTAATGAGCTCTAT-3′. The underlined areas correspond to the C/EBPβ binding site of the mouse iNOS gene promoter. At the distal end of the primers, aSacI restriction site was included and a XhoI site was included at the proximal end of the primers. After annealing and SacI/XhoI digestion, the fragment was ligated into a pGL-3 basic vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the resulting reporter construct was confirmed by sequencing. To assay the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and C/EBPβ, cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected with either pBIIX-Luc, an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (32Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), or pC/EBPβ-Luc by using the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Life Technologies, Inc.) (24Pahan K. Sheikh F.G.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2288-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All transfections included 50 ng/μg total DNA of pRL-TK (a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase used as transfection efficiency control; Promega). After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 6 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were obtained by analyzing total cell extract according to standard instructions provided by the Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega) in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Relative luciferase activity of cell extracts was typically represented as the ratio of firefly luciferase value/Renilla luciferase value × 10−3. Ligation of CD40 was achieved by using cross-linking antibodies against CD40 (anti-CD40). Recently, it has been shown that CD40 is constitutively expressed at low levels on cultured glial cells (33Tan J. Town T. Paris D. Placzek A. Parker T. Crawford F. Yu H. Humphrey J. Mullan M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 97: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Nguyen V.T. Walker W.S. Benveniste E.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The results depicted in Fig. 1 show that IFN-γ alone was capable of inducing the production of NO in mouse BV-2 microglial cells at different hours of stimulation. On the other hand, ligation of CD40 by anti-CD40 alone was unable to induce the production of NO. However, anti-CD40 markedly stimulated IFN-γ-induced production of NO at different hours of stimulation. The stimulation of NO production by anti-CD40 was also dose-dependent, resulting in maximal stimulation of IFN-γ-induced production of NO at a concentration of 2 μg/ml (Fig. 2 A). The inhibition of NO production by arginase (an enzyme that degrades the substrate, l-arginine, of NOS) and l-NMA (a competitive inhibitor of NOS) but not by d-NMA (a negative control of l-NMA) suggests that IFN-γ/anti-CD40-induced NO production in BV-2 microglial cells is dependent on NOS-mediated arginine metabolism (data not shown). To understand the mechanism of stimulation of NO production, we examined the effect of anti-CD40 on protein and mRNA levels of iNOS in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. Western blot analysis with antibodies against murine macrophage iNOS and Northern blot analysis for iNOS mRNA clearly showed that IFN-γ but not CD40 ligation alone induced the expression of iNOS protein (Fig. 2 B) and iNOS mRNA (Fig. 2 C). However, consistent with the stimulation of NO production, ligation of CD40 markedly stimulated IFN-γ-induced expression of iNOS protein and iNOS mRNA.Figure 2CD40 ligation stimulates the expression of iNOS in IFN-γ-treated BV-2 microglial cells. Cells were treated with different concentrations of cross-linking antibodies against CD40 in the presence or absence of IFN-γ (25 units/ml) under serum-free conditions. A, after 24 h, supernatants were used for the nitrite assay as mentioned under “Materials and Methods.” Data are mean ± S.D. of three different experiments. B, cell homogenates were electrophoresed, transferred on nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS as described under “Materials and Methods.” C, after 6 h of incubation, cells were taken out directly by adding Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.) to the plates for isolation of total RNA, and Northern blot analysis for iNOS mRNA was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further prove from a different perspective that CD40-CD40L interaction augments the induction of iNOS, we examined the effect of human soluble recombinant CD40L (CD154) on the induction of iNOS in BV-2 microglial cells. Consistent with the effect of anti-CD40, recombinant CD40L alone was unable to induce the production of NO (Fig.3 A) and the expression of iNOS mRNA (Fig. 3 B). However, CD40L markedly stimulated IFN-γ-induced production of NO and the expression of iNOS mRNA, confirming that CD40-CD40L interaction has a stimulatory effect on the expression of iNOS. The inability of recombinant CD40L and anti-CD40 to induce the expression of iNOS in IFN-γ-untreated cells suggests that either signals transduced by CD40 ligation alone are not sufficient for the induction of iNOS, or the expression of CD40 is too low to be ligated enough by anti-CD40 or CD40L to induce the expression of iNOS. To examine the validity of the latter possibility, we studied the effect of CD40 ligation on the induction of iNOS in CD40-overexpressed BV-2 microglial cells. Cells were transfected with different concentrations of mouse CD40 cDNA expression construct followed by the ligation of CD40 in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. Ligation of CD40 in the presence of IFN-γ induced the production of NO by ∼70-fold in CD40 cDNA-transfected BV-2 glial cells as compared with a ∼16-fold induction in empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4). On the other hand, CD40 ligation by anti-CD40 was unable to induce the production of NO even in CD40 cDNA-transfected BV-2 microglial cells (Fig. 4). The increase of IFN-γ/anti-CD40-induced NO production by CD40 cDNA was dose-dependent, and the maximal increase of NO production was observed at 0.2 μg. However, IFN-γ/anti-CD40-induced NO production decreased in cells transfected with higher doses of CD40 cDNA (Fig. 4). This decrease in NO production was due to the increase in cell death in the presence of IFN-γ and anti-CD40 at higher concentrations of CD40 cDNA (data not shown), suggesting that too much CD40 ligation is cytotoxic to the cells. Northern blot analysis also showed that CD40 ligation alone was unable to induce the expression of iNOS mRNA in CD40 cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5). However, a marked stimulation of IFN-γ-induced expression of iNOS mRNA by CD40 ligation was observed in CD40 cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5). Stimulation of IFN-γ-induced expression of iNOS mRNA by overexpression of CD40 even in the absence of CD40 ligation (Fig. 5) suggests that overexpression of CD40 probably mimics the clustering associated with CD40 ligation. Taken together, these studies suggest that the inability of CD40 ligation to induce the expression of iNOS in IFN-γ-untreated cells is not due to the weak expression of CD40. Therefore, it is likely that signals transduced by CD40 ligation alone are not sufficient for the induction of iNOS.Figure 5Effect of overexpression of CD40 on the expression of iNOS mRNA in BV-2 microglial cells. Cells plated at 50–60% confluence in a 100-mm dish were transfected with 0.8 μg of either CD40 cDNA or an empty vector. After 24 h of transfection, cells were stimulated with anti-CD40 (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of IFN-γ (10 units/ml) under serum-free conditions. After 6 h of incubation, total RNA was isolated from cells, and Northern blot analysis for iNOS mRNA was carried out.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The presence of NF-κB DNA-binding sites in the promoter of iNOS (35Xie Q.

Tiam1 specifically activates Rac, and earlier studies have demonstrated that Tiam1-Rac signaling affects migration and invasion in a cell type- and cell substrate-specific manner. In the present study, we examined the role of Tiam1-Rac signaling in migration and invasion of human renal cell carcinomas. Stable overexpression of Tiam1 or constitutively active V12-Rac1 in a human renal cell carcinoma cell line (clearCa-28) strongly inhibited cell migration by promoting E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Blocking E-cadherin-mediated adhesion by E-cadherin-specific HAV peptides allowed cells to migrate, but was not sufficient to antagonize Tiam1- and V12-Rac1-induced inhibition of Matrigel invasion, suggesting that Rac may influence invasion also through other mechanisms. Indeed, Tiam1-mediated Rac activation induced transcriptional up-regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and post-transcriptional up-regulation of TIMP-2, whereas secretion and activity levels of their counterparts, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and matrix metalloproteinase-2, respectively, were not affected. Application of recombinant TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 proteins significantly inhibited invasion of mock-transfected clearCa-28 cells, supporting a role of TIMPs in Rac-mediated inhibition of invasion. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that increased Rac signaling may inhibit invasion of epithelial tumor cells by up-regulation of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.

Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 13Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2329-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These seemingly opposing effects of Rac on both migration and invasion of epithelial cells were reconciled at least in part by the observations that the effects of Rac depend on the cell-substrate used, whether or not the formation of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions is prevented, and the cell type studied (14Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

Cell. 1999; 10: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For instance, in human keratinocytes it has recently been demonstrated that, although Rac is required for the formation of E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesions, activation of Rac may also lead to the disruption of these adhesions in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (17Braga V.M. Betson M. Li X. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3703-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In recent studies on mesenchymal cells, Rac has also been implicated in the regulation of distinct matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (18Kheradmand F. Werner E. Tremble P. Symons M. Werb Z. Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 19Zhuge Y. Xu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16248-16256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). MMPs represent a family of proteases, which are subclassified according to their substrate preferences and structural properties (for review, see Ref. 20Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Of all MMPs, MMP-2 (gelatinase-A, 72-kDa type IV collagenase) and MMP-9 (gelatinase-B, 92-kDa type IV collagenase) in particular are known to play a pivotal role in tumor invasion by proteolytic degradation of major basement membrane components such as type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen (20Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 21Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 22Ray J.M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Eur. Respir. J. 1994; 7: 2062-2072PubMed Google Scholar). Like most MMPs, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are secreted as latent pro-enzymes (pro-MMPs), which are extracellularly activated through proteolytic cleavage by other MMPs or other enzyme classes (20Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 21Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Activities of MMPs are counterbalanced by specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), four different isoforms of which have been identified so far (23Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fassina G. Ferrari N. Brigati C. Benelli R. Santi L. Noonan D.M. Albini A. Clin. Exp.

Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). Although all TIMPs inhibit MMP-2 and MMP-9 as well as other MMP activities by forming 1:1 molar stoichiometric complexes with active enzymes, the association of TIMPs with pro-MMPs, which prevents subsequent activation of these pro-enzymes, is more specific; TIMP-1 associates exclusively with pro-MMP-9, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 only with pro-MMP-2. In contrast, TIMP-3 interacts with both pro-enzymes (23Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bigg H.F. Shi Y.E. Liu Y.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Imbalances between pro-MMPs/MMPs and TIMPs are thought to influence the invasive phenotype of cells, and consequently overexpression of any of the TIMP isoforms or application of recombinant TIMP proteins were found to inhibit invasion in different tumor models (23Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang M. Liu Y.E. Greene J. Sheng S. Fuchs A. Rosen E.M. Shi Y.E.

Cancer. 1999; 79: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To our best knowledge, a role for Rac in regulating TIMP expression has not been reported yet. Here we have analyzed the role of Rac signaling in invasion and migration of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We show that activation of Rac promotes E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and inhibits cell dissociation in RCC cells. Activation of Rac also inhibits the more complex process of Matrigel invasion. Invasiveness could not be restored by blocking E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, suggesting the existence of an additional, E-cadherin-independent mechanism through which activated Rac may inhibit invasion. In search for this mechanism, we found selective up-regulation of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 by Tiam1 and Rac. The functional relevance of this up-regulation was substantiated by demonstrating that TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 inhibit Matrigel invasion of mock-transfected control cells. The human clear cell RCC cell line clearCa-28 hardly expresses endogenous Tiam1 (30Engers R. Zwaka T.P. Gohr L. Weber A. Gerharz C.D. Gabbert H.E. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and was chosen for transfection experiments and studies on Rac-mediated invasion. ClearCa-28 was kindly provided by Dr. Gerharz (Heinrich-Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany) and was stably transfected by retroviral transduction with either empty vector (pLZRS), an active mutant of Tiam1 (C1199-Tiam1) (9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) or Myc epitope-tagged, constitutively active V12-Rac1 as described (9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the present study, C1199-Tiam1, comprising the COOH-terminal 1199 amino acids, was used instead of full-length (FL)-Tiam1, because this protein is more stable and active than that of FL-Tiam1 (9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 31Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Salinas P.C. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The effects of C1199-Tiam1 and V12-Rac1 observed in clearCa-28 cells (see “Results”) were verified in a human colon carcinoma cell line, which was stably transfected as described above. This cell line was established in our laboratory from a histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon and designated as DusCol-1B. A detailed characterization of this cell line will be described elsewhere. 2R. Engers, V. Kehren, and H. E. Gabbert, manuscript in preparation. Stably transfected cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (both Sigma) and antibiotics. G418 (Sigma) was used as a selection marker for the presence of pLZRS in a concentration of 500 μg/ml. HepG2 cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS (both Sigma) and antibiotics. Cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. In vitro invasiveness was determined by means of the Matrigel invasion assay, which was essentially performed as recently described (32Engers R. Gerharz C.D. Donner A. Mrzyk S. Krause-Paulus R. Petek O. Gabbert H.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this invasion assay, tumor cells have to overcome a reconstituted basement membrane by a sequential process of proteolytic degradation of the substrate and active migration. Costar transwells (pore size 8 μm) were coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson), dried at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, and reconstituted with serum-free medium. The homogeneity of the coating was checked by protein stain. A single cell suspension of 50,000 tumor cells in serum-free medium was inoculated to the upper chamber, after having added conditioned serum-free medium to the lower chamber. Tumor cell invasiveness was determined by counting all tumor cells in five randomly selected counting areas at the lower surface of the filter after an incubation period of 24 h. Cells on the upper surface were wiped away, filters were fixed in methanol, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Invasion of mock-transfected clearCa-28 cells was also analyzed in the absence or presence of recombinant TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 proteins (Chemicon) as indicated. Invasion of both mock-transfected cells and C1199-Tiam1-expressing cells was also investigated in the presence of E-cadherin-specific inhibitory HAV peptides (500 μg/ml) (14Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

Biol. 1990; 139: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in triplicate and was repeated twice. Data were statistically analyzed by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Cell migration was determined as tumor cell spreading from three-dimensional tumor cell spheroids as described recently (32Engers R. Gerharz C.D. Donner A. Mrzyk S. Krause-Paulus R. Petek O. Gabbert H.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Spheroids were produced by incubating tumor cells on a gyratory shaker and were used because they recapitulate the in vivo situation where cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions are involved in the process of migration (1Mareel M.M. van Roy F.M. Bracke M.E. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 559-594PubMed Google Scholar). From each cell line, 6 spheroids, each 0.4 mm in diameter, were selected and singly transferred to a 24-well plate. Subsequently, tumor cells were incubated for 48 h, and the capability of tumor cells to leave the spheroid by active locomotion was determined by measuring the longest and shortest diameter of the outgrown field vertical to each other after 48 h. Migration was determined on laminin (Sigma), as laminin is a major component of basement membranes and Matrigel. Each experiment was repeated twice. As the area of outgrowth covered by tumor cells (A) was ellipse- or circle-like in shape, its size was calculated according to the following formula:A = (longest diameter × shortest diameter)/4 × π. The data were statistically analyzed by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney-U test. To investigate cell-cell adhesion and growth patterns, single cell suspensions of stably transfected cell lines were seeded into six-well cell culture plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Cell-cell adhesion and growth patterns were analyzed morphologically by means of phase contrast microscopy. To investigate whether Tiam1-induced cell-cell adhesion (see below) was mediated by distinct cadherins, as was reported from Ras-transformed MDCK cells (9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), single cell suspensions of stably transfected cell lines were incubated either in normal cell culture medium or medium supplemented with human E-cadherin- or N-cadherin-specific inhibitory HAV peptides (500 μg/ml) (14Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

Biol. 1990; 139: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). For detection of Tiam1 or Myc epitope-tagged V12-Rac1 expression, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μm aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, and 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (32Engers R. Gerharz C.D. Donner A. Mrzyk S. Krause-Paulus R. Petek O. Gabbert H.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For detection of E-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, or γ-catenin, cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 50 mmNaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0,5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (34Rosato R. Veltmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Secretion levels of TIMPs were determined in the same concentrated serum-free medium as used for zymography (see below). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method, and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Expression/secretion levels of the respective proteins were determined by immunoblotting. Specific polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, TIMP-4), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tiam1), Zymed Laboratories Inc. (α-catenin), and Sigma (β-catenin). Specific monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Saxon Biochemicals (E-cadherin) and Transduction Laboratories (γ-catenin). Myc epitope-tagged V12-Rac1 was detected using monoclonal antibody 9E10. Antibodies were used in dilutions of 1:500 (E-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, γ-catenin, TIMP-1, TIMP-2), 1:1000 (Tiam1, V12-Rac1), or 1:2000 (TIMP-3, TIMP-4). For detection the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. Cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium. Supernatants were collected and calibrated with the cell numbers, and concentrations of secreted TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 proteins were determined by commercially available TIMP-1- and TIMP-2-specific immunoassay kits (Chemicon), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amounts and activities of secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9, also referred to as 72- and 92-kDa gelatinases, respectively, were determined by gelatin zymography as described (32Engers R. Gerharz C.D. Donner A. Mrzyk S. Krause-Paulus R. Petek O. Gabbert H.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. The supernatant, calibrated with the numbers of cells in culture, was concentrated 15-fold by ultrafiltration (Centricon 10, Amicon), mixed with Laemmli sample buffer without reducing agents, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were subjected to nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 0.2% gelatin co-polymerized in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100; incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 for 24 h; and stained with Coomassie Blue R250. Because of the substrate specificity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and the fact that conversion of latent pro-enzymes of MMP-2 and MMP-9 to the active enzymes results in the removal of a 10-kDa amino-terminal domain, each protease can be determined by gelatin zymography, as indicated by clear bands of gelatinolytic activity of the respective molecular weights (22Ray J.M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Eur. Respir. J. 1994; 7: 2062-2072PubMed Google Scholar). Amounts and activities of cell membrane-associated MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined as described by Cao et al. (35Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Northern blots for TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were performed as described previously (36Engers R. van Roy F. Heymer T. Ramp U. Moll R. Dienst M. Friebe U. Pohl A. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Probes were obtained from purified inserts of the following plasmids, which were kindly provided by Dr. P. Brown (British Biotech Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom): human entire TIMP-1 cDNA in pGEM-4Z (insert:EcoRI/EcoRI), human entire TIMP-2 cDNA in pGEM-4Z (insert: HindIII/EcoRI). To investigate the effects of Tiam1 and Rac on TIMP-1 promoter activation, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a −102/+95 human TIMP-1 promoter CAT-reporter construct (37Clark I.M. Rowan A.D. Edwards D.R. Bech H.T. Mann D.A. Bahr M.J. Cawston T.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. I. M. Clark (University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom), and FL-Tiam1, C1199-Tiam1, C580-Tiam1, wild-type (WT)-Rac1, V12-Rac1, or the empty expression vector (pMT2SM). C1199-Tiam1 was also co-transfected with Myc epitope-tagged dominant negative N17-Rac1 (in pMT2SM) in addition to the promoter construct to verify that Tiam1-induced effects were mediated by Rac. Cloning procedures of the constructs used have been described previously (7Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G.

Cells were seeded at 1.6–2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates, allowed to settle overnight, and transiently transfected using FuGENE (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (3 μl of FuGENE/μg DNA, and 100 ng of DNA/construct and well). Prior to application of the respective FuGENE-DNA solutions, FCS-containing RPMI medium was substituted by FCS-free RPMI medium, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed using 40–50 μl/well “reporter gene lysis buffer” (Roche), and subsequently frozen at −80 °C until use. CAT reporter gene assays were then performed using the CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche) with 10–20 μl of the lysate. CAT levels were normalized to protein levels determined with the BCA method (Pierce). For all tested combinations, cells were transfected at least in triplicate wells and at least two independent experiments were performed. To investigate the role of Tiam1-Rac signaling in migration and invasion of human RCC, clearCa-28 cells were stably transfected by retroviral transduction with either empty vector (mock), C1199-Tiam1 or constitutively active V12-Rac1, and pools of stably expressing cells were used for further investigations (Fig. 1 A). Stable overexpression of C1199-Tiam1 or V12-Rac1 in clearCa-28 cells resulted in a strong and significant inhibition of cell migration on laminin (p< 0.001), when compared with mock-transfected tumor cells (Fig. 1 B), consistent with the finding that Tiam1 activates Rac. Similar effects as observed for three-dimensional tumor cell spheroids were seen, when migration was analyzed in the scratch assay (data not shown). Moreover, C1199-Tiam1 and V12-Rac1 also significantly inhibited the more complex process of Matrigel invasion (p = 0.006 and p = 0.018, respectively; Fig. 1 C), which also requires proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix. Given the established role of Rac in promoting E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (8Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the observed inhibitory effects of C1199-Tiam1 and V12-Rac1 on invasion may result at least partly from Rac-mediated inhibition of cell migration, because of up-regulation of E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion. The inhibitory effects of C1199-Tiam1 and V12-Rac1 on migration and invasion cannot simply be explained by effects on proliferation, because both C1199-Tiam1- and V12-Rac1-transfecetd cells exhibited even a higher proliferation activity than mock-transfected control cells (data not shown). C1199-Tiam1 and V12-Rac1 also affected cell-cell adhesion and in vitro growth patterns. ClearCa-28 cells, stably transfected with empty vector, exhibited a spindle-shaped phenotype and a dissociated growth pattern as was seen in the nontransfected parental cell line (Fig. 2). In contrast, expression of C1199-Tiam1 or V12-Rac1 induced a polygonal epithelial phenotype and a growth pattern in solid tumor islands, indicative for increased cell-cell adhesions. The effects of V12-Rac1 were less pronounced than those of C1199-Tiam1, which is in accordance with previous observations in epithelial cells (9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To explore whether C1199-Tiam1- and V12-Rac1-induced cell-cell adhesion was mediated by E-cadherin, as was reported from Ras-transformed MDCK cells (9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), growth patterns were analyzed in the presence of either human E-cadherin- or human N-cadherin-specific inhibitory HAV peptides. Incubation with a human E-cadherin-specific inhibitory HAV peptide prevented the formation of stable cell-cell adhesion in C1199-Tiam1-expressing cells and induced a spindle-shaped phenotype as well as a dissociated growth pattern, whereas no effects were seen upon exposure to a human N-cadherin-specific blocking peptide (Fig. 3).

However, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol increases the levels of TNFα are not well characterized. Utilizing Kupffer cells isolated from rats fed an ethanol containing diet and a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, exposed to ethanol in culture, we have demonstrated that exposure to chronic ethanol results in an enhanced expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNFα. While chronic ethanol had no effect on the rate of LPS-induced TNFα transcription as measured by nuclear run-on experiments, TNFα mRNA half-life was increased by chronic ethanol. Chronic ethanol also potentiated the activation of LPS-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in Kupffer cells, as well as in RAW264.7 cells. Specific inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activation by SB203580 in Kupffer cells or by overexpression of dominant negative p38 MAP kinase in RAW264.7 cells blocked ethanol-mediated TNFα mRNA stabilization. Furthermore, using chimeric reporter constructs, we have shown that A + U-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region of TNFα mRNA are not sufficient to impart ethanol-mediated stabilization on TNFα mRNA.

Furthermore, using chimeric reporter constructs, we have shown that A + U-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region of TNFα mRNA are not sufficient to impart ethanol-mediated stabilization on TNFα mRNA. tumor necrosis factor α interleukin lipopolysaccharide RNase protection assay mitogen-activated protein extracellular regulated kinase stress activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase untranslated region A + U-rich elements cyclo-oxygenase-2 protein kinase C glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase The inflammatory response is a key component of host defense. Macrophages participate in this tightly regulated process, at least in part, via the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)1 and interleukin-1 (IL-1), in response to various stimuli encountered in the tissue microenvironment. TNFα is one of the principal mediators of the inflammatory response in mammals, transducing differential signals that regulate cellular activation and proliferation, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis (1Beutler B.

In addition to its role in acute septic shock, TNFα has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of inflammatory diseases (3Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E.

Data from a number of animal studies, in combination with clinical studies, indicate that long-term alcohol consumption results in the development of fatty liver and steatohepatitis with progression to more severe liver damage including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (9Tilg H. Diehl A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). At least some of these alcohol-induced liver abnormalities have been linked to the overexpression of TNFα. Indeed, enhanced levels of TNFα have been observed in the liver of ethanol-fed animals, as well as in the circulation of patients with alcoholic liver disease (10Bode C. Kugler V. Bode J.C. J. Hepatol. 1987; 4: 8-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 11Fukui H. Brauner B. Bode J. Bode C. J. Hepatol. 1991; 12: 162-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms leading to this overexpression in response to alcohol are poorly understood.Considering the pleiotropic actions of TNFα, it is not surprising that its biosynthesis is under the control of multiple and complex regulatory mechanisms. TNFα expression is regulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, as well as translational levels (1Beutler B. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 227-235PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jacob C.O. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 122-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Jacob C.O. Lee S.K. Strassmann G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar).

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5579-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Stabilization of mRNAs contributes to the strong and rapid induction of genes in the inflammatory process. Although the mechanisms involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation are complex, the mRNA itself contains sequence-specific information that determines its stability (14Sachs A.B.

Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar). TNFα mRNA, like other short-lived mRNAs, contains A + U-rich elements (ARE) in its 3′-untranslated region (UTR) which function as destabilizing elements as demonstrated in TNFα-ARE knockout mouse in vivo (17Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), as well as in various in vitro systems (13Hel Z.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). AREs have also been implicated in stimulus-induced stabilization of otherwise unstable mRNAs (19Tebo J.M. Datta S. Kishore R.

Sequences in the 5′-UTRs or coding regions, acting either in concert with AREs in the 3′-UTR or independently, also contribute to mRNA stabilization of certain genes (19Tebo J.M. Datta S. Kishore R.

Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways involved in the control of mRNA stabilization are not well defined.Proinflammatory cytokines and external stressors act through receptor-dependent signaling cascades that diverge into multiple pathways, including the NFκB pathway (22Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar) and each of the three mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases: extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), and p38 MAP kinase (23Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 24Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). While each of these signaling pathways contributes to the activation of gene transcription (22Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar), their role in controlling gene expression at the level of mRNA stability is not well understood. Although some studies have shown the involvement of ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK pathways in the mRNA stability (21Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 26Lee N.H. Malek R.L. J. Biol.

Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 29Brook M. Sully G. Clark A.R.

Thus, while AREs confer instability on mRNAs, they also allow mRNA stabilization following activation of p38 MAPK pathway (30Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).Despite the suggested role of TNFα in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease, the mechanisms by which chronic alcohol exposure increases TNFα expression are not well understood. Ethanol modulates the activity of several important signaling molecules (32Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) including ERK1/2, p38 MAPK (33Chen J.P. Ishac E.J.N. Dent P. Kunos G. Gao B. Biochem.

Res. 1996; 20: 1639-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Egr-1. 2L. Shi, R. Kishore, M. R. McMullen, and L. E. Nagy, submitted for publication.2L. Shi, R. Kishore, M. R. McMullen, and L. E. Nagy, submitted for publication.However, it is not known whether ethanol-induced changes in these pathways contribute to abnormal TNFα transcription and/or translation.To investigate the mechanism for ethanol-mediated increases in TNFα, we have studied the effect of chronic ethanol in the regulation of LPS-induced TNFα expression, both in Kupffer cells isolated from ethanol-fed rats, as well as in a mouse macrophage like cell line, RAW264.7, exposed to chronic ethanol in culture. We demonstrate, for the first time, that ethanol stabilizes LPS-induced TNFα mRNA. We further demonstrate that activation of p38 MAP kinase pathway is required for the ethanol-mediated TNFα mRNA stabilization, but that the AREs in the TNFα-3′-UTR are not sufficient to mediate ethanol-induced stabilization of TNFα mRNA.DISCUSSIONAlthough enhanced expression of TNFα has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease, the molecular mechanisms regulating TNFα overexpression are not well understood. In the present study, utilizing an ethanol-fed rat model, as well as mouse macrophage cells exposed to ethanol in culture, we have demonstrated that chronic ethanol specifically increases the LPS-induced TNFα mRNA stability. Furthermore, stabilization of TNFα mRNA by ethanol was dependent on activation of p38 MAP kinase, but independent of the ARE sequences in the 3′-UTR of the TNFα mRNA. Chronic ethanol specifically enhanced the accumulation of TNFα; this specific increase in TNFα mRNA level was observed both in mouse RAW264.7 macrophage cells after in vitro exposure to ethanol and in Kupffer cells isolated from rats fed ethanol in vivo. Furthermore, in both types of macrophages, chronic ethanol increased the half-life of LPS-induced TNFα mRNA, without affecting the rate of TNFα transcription. Increased stability of TNFα mRNA was directly associated with an increase in LPS-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase; inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activation by two different approaches blocked the ethanol-mediated stabilization of TNFα mRNA, while inhibition of ERK1/2 activation did not affect TNFα mRNA stability. Moreover, AREs in the 3′-UTR of TNFα mRNA destabilized luciferase reporter mRNA but were not sufficient to render ethanol-mediated stabilization on the transgene.There is now general agreement that long-term alcohol consumption leads to an increased expression of TNFα in liver. It has been suggested that chronic ethanol consumption compromises the barrier function of gastrointestinal mucosa, overexposing liver cells to endotoxins, such as LPS, and resulting in an increased TNFα production (40Bickel M. Cohen R.B. Pluznik D.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 840-845PubMed Google Scholar, 41Honchel R. Marsono L. Cohen D. Shedlofsky S. McClain C. Dinarello C.A. Kluger M.J. Powanda M.C. Oppenheim J.J.

Hepatology. 2000; 32: 1008-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Indeed, ethanol-induced liver injury was blunted by treating ethanol-fed rats with antibiotics, further supporting the association of endotoxins with the ethanol-induced liver injury (43Adachi Y. Moore L.E. Bradford B.U. Gao W. Thurman R.G. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 218-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism by which chronic ethanol up-regulates LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators including TNFα. Our data show that ethanol specifically enhanced TNFα mRNA level in rat Kupffer cells, but did not increase the accumulation of other proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 1). Interestingly, chronic ethanol decreased the LPS-induced mRNA accumulation of IL-1β. IL-1β expression is regulated by many of the mechanisms as TNFα, involving modulation of gene transcription, mRNA stability and mRNA translation (44Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 45Saklatvala J. Dean J. Finch A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 63-77PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the differential effect of chronic ethanol on LPS-induced mRNA expression of TNFα and IL-1β in Kupffer cells suggests that chronic ethanol must impact on distinct molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways to differentially regulate the expression of TNFα compared with IL-1β.Cell type and stimulus specific transcriptional regulation of TNFα has been reported in a number of studies (1Beutler B. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 227-235PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jacob C.O. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 122-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 46Pauli U. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1994; 4: 323-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that exposure of RAW264.7 macrophages to chronic ethanol modulates the LPS-induced DNA binding activity of at least two transcription factors to the TNFα promoter. Chronic ethanol increases Egr-1 binding activity, but decreases the binding activity of NFκB.2 However, in the present study, we found no discernible changes in the rate of de novo transcribed TNFα in response to chronic ethanol (Fig. 2). These results indicate that despite multiple effects on DNA binding activity of key transcription factors, there is no net effect on the rate of TNFα transcription in response to chronic ethanol and that post-transcriptional mechanism(s) must contribute to ethanol-mediated up-regulation of TNFα mRNA.Chronic ethanol stabilized the LPS-induced TNFα mRNA both in a mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and in Kupffer cells isolated from rats fed ethanol for 4 weeks (Fig. 3). Utilizing a wide variety of cell types, several studies have shown stimulus-specific stabilization of otherwise labile mRNAs that contributes to a rapid increase in their abundance. Phorbol ester treatment increases the half-life of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor mRNA (16Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar, 47Bjarnason I. Ward K. Peters T.J. Lancet. 1984; 1: 179-182Abstract PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Calcium ionophore transiently stabilizes IL-3 mRNA in a murine mast cell line (48Wodnar-Filipowicz A. Moroni C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In T cells, IL-2 mRNA is stabilized by co-stimulatory signal through CD-28, upon stimulation of T cell receptor (49Lindstein T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). More recently a number of studies have shown the stimulus-induced stabilization of COX-2, IL-6, IL-8, GROα, MCP-1, and TNFα mRNAs in macrophage/monocytes, as well as in other cell types (19Tebo J.M.

Cytokine. 1999; 11: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, this is the first study to demonstrate ethanol-mediated modulation of TNFα stability in any cell type. Whether this phenomenon is a more generalized effect of ethanol or is restricted to macrophages remains to be elucidated.LPS is known to activate all members of the MAP kinase family. To gain insight into the role of MAP kinase signaling pathways in the ethanol-mediated stabilization of TNFα transcript, we studied the effect of chronic ethanol on the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases. Chronic ethanol exposure increased LPS stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 5). This observation is consistent with a number of other studies reporting the effect of ethanol on MAP kinase activation. Ethanol exposure, both long- and short-term, potentiates agonist-induced activation of p38, ERK1/2, as well as SAPK/JNK MAP kinases in hepatocytes (33Chen J.P. Ishac E.J.N. Dent P. Kunos G. Gao B. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34Roivainen R. Hundle B. Messing R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Long-term ethanol exposure increases NGF-stimulated ERK1/2 in PC12 cells (41Honchel R. Marsono L. Cohen D. Shedlofsky S. McClain C. Dinarello C.A. Kluger M.J. Powanda M.C. Oppenheim J.J. The Physiological and Pathological Effects of Cytokines. 10B. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 171-176Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, ethanol potentiates sphingosine-1 phosphate-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, but not p38 MAP kinase (51Huang J.S. Mukherjee J.J. Kiss Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that in RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells, chronic ethanol increases LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAP kinases.2 The mechanism by which ethanol potentiates LPS-stimulated activation of p38 remains an unresolved question. Since chronic ethanol increases both LPS-stimulated ERK1/2 and p38, we are currently investigating whether ethanol acts at a common upstream signaling intermediate linking LPS-receptor activation to both these members of the MAP kinase family. Alternatively, ethanol could also enhance ERK1/2 and p38 activity by decreasing MAP kinase phosphatase-1 activity, which can inactivate both phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38.There is growing body of evidence indicating the participation of MAP kinases in stimulus-induced stabilization of various short-lived transcripts. Studies on the signaling pathways involved in mRNA stability have shown p38, ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK MAP kinases, as well as cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, are important contributors to this post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism (21Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 28Xu K. Robida A.M. Murphy T.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7604-7611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The emerging picture from these studies suggests that stabilization of mRNAs can be achieved by different signaling events; effectors of multiple signaling cascades impact on the pathways regulating mRNA decay. These effectors can, therefore, connect changes in the extracellular environment to the post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Here we have shown that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase specifically abrogates the ethanol-mediated stabilization of the TNFα transcript (Figs. 6 and 7). p38 MAP kinase has been implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability in other systems as well. For example, while maximal IL-8 gene expression requires activation of all three MAP kinases, the p38 MAP kinase pathway selectively stabilizes IL-8 mRNA (44Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Similarly, COX-2 mRNA stabilization in HeLa cells involves activation of p38 MAP kinase (31Lasa M. Brook M. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell.

Although chronic ethanol potentiates LPS-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in RAW264.7 cells,2 inhibition of ERK1/2 activation either by the specific inhibitor PD98059 or by kinase-dead dominant negative ERK1/2 has no effect on stability of TNFα mRNA (Figs. 6 and 7). Taken together, our data clearly show that although ethanol can potentiate the LPS-induced activation of both p38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases, only p38 MAP kinase participates in ethanol-mediated stabilization of the TNFα mRNA.AREs present in the 3′-UTR of cytokine genes are well documented to mediate destabilization and/or stimulus-dependent stabilization of their respective mRNAs (14Sachs A.B.

Activation of the p38 MAP kinase stabilizes reporter β-globin mRNAs containing ARE sequences in the 3′-UTRs of IL-6, IL-8, c-fos, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, respectively (20Winzen R.

Therefore, we studied the requirement of the TNFα ARE sequences in the destabilization and ethanol-mediated stabilization of reporter luciferase mRNA. As expected, the TNFα AREs destabilized reporter mRNA. We, however, saw no evidence that TNFα AREs are involved in ethanol-mediated stabilization of the reporter luciferase mRNA. Although data presented in this study do not rule out the necessity of TNFα ARE sequences, nevertheless, they indicate that the TNFα AREs are not sufficient to modulate ethanol-mediated stabilization of the transcript. There are other examples where regulation of mRNA stability is determined not only by the ARE sequences in the 3′-UTR, but also by additional sequences found either in 5′-UTR or within the coding region of the corres"

Inhibition of erythroid K-Cl cotransport has emerged as an important adjunct strategy for the treatment of sickle cell anemia. However, structure-function relationships among the polypeptide products of the four K-Cl cotransporter (KCC) genes are little understood. We have investigated the importance of the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of mouse KCC1 to its K-Cl cotransport function expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Truncation of as few as eight C-terminal amino acids (aa) abolished function despite continued polypeptide accumulation and surface expression. These C-terminal loss-of-function mutants lacked a dominant negative phenotype. Truncation of the N-terminal 46 aa diminished function. Removal of 89 or 117 aa (ΔN117) abolished function despite continued polypeptide accumulation and surface expression and exhibited dominant negative phenotypes that required the presence of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The dominant negative loss-of-function mutant ΔN117 was co-immunoprecipitated with wild type KCC1 polypeptide, and its co-expression did not reduce wild type KCC1 at the oocyte surface. ΔN117 also exhibited dominant negative inhibition of human KCC1 and KCC3 and, with lower potency, mouse KCC4 and rat KCC2. K-Cl cotransport regulates cell volume and chloride equilibrium potential.

NKCCs are activated by hypertonic cell shrinkage and by activators of protein phosphorylation. NKCCs tend to be inhibited by cell swelling, by sulfhydryl oxidizing agents, and by inhibitors of protein dephosphorylation. In contrast, KCCs are activated by hypotonic cell swelling, by sulfhydryl oxidizing agents, and by inhibitors of protein phosphorylation. KCCs tend to be inhibited by cell shrinkage and by inhibitors of protein dephosphorylation (4Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Heterologous overexpression of KCC1 leads to up-regulation of endogenous NKCC activity (15Gillen C.M. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C328-C336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which KCCs are regulated are unknown. The transmembrane region of CCC polypeptides, based on data from NKCC1, probably spans the lipid bilayer 12 times (16Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40471-40477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transmembrane helices 2, 4, and 7 of NKCC1 have been implicated in ion binding by site-directed mutagenesis studies (17Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The two initial reports on structure-function relationships of K-Cl cotransporters concern aspects of their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. Tyr1087 of rat KCC2, close to KCC2's C terminus, and the analogous residue in rabbit KCC1 are each required for hypotonic activation of ion transport activity in Xenopusoocytes. However, neither residue is required for delivery to the oocyte surface or for inhibition of hypotonically activated transport activity by serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitors (18Strange K. Singer T.D. Morrison R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C860-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Lauf et al. (19Lauf P.K. Zhang J. Gagnon K.B.E. Delpire E. Fyffe R.E.W. Adragna N.C. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown that removal from Myc-tagged rabbit KCC1 of most of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain abolished activation by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in HEK-293 cells while apparently decreasing but not abolishing surface expression. Inhibition of the potassium efflux pathways mediating cell shrinkage has proven an increasingly important approach to the therapy of sickle cell disease. The major potassium efflux pathways of the sickle erythrocyte are K-Cl cotransport and the IK1 KCa channel (20Brugnara C. De Franceschi L. Saadane N. Trudel M. Beuzard Y. Rittenhouse A. Alper S.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 763: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although high potency inhibitors of the IK1 erythroid KCa channel are available, clinically tolerated (21Brugnara C. Gee B. Armsby C. Kurth S. Sakamoto M. Rifai N. Alper S.L. Platt O. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and in continued development, high potency inhibitors of K-Cl cotransport have not been identified. KCC inhibitors could serve as an adjunct treatment of sickle cell disease, as shown to date with clinical trials of oral magnesium supplementation (22De Franceschi L. Bachir D. Galacteros F. Tchernia G. Cynober T. Alper S.L. Platt O. Beuzard Y. Brugnara C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Such specific KCC inhibitors would also provide a useful experimental tool to test the role of K-Cl cotransport in cell function. We have initiated structure-function studies with the 1085-aa mouse KCC1 K-Cl cotransporter. We show here that both the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and the membrane-proximate portion of the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain are absolutely required for transport function in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, we show that removal of the entire N-terminal cytoplasmic domain from KCC1 confers a dominant negative phenotype that requires the presence of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The dominant negative mutant polypeptide associates physically with the wild type KCC1 polypeptide and exhibits its dominant negative phenotype when co-expressed with other KCC gene products. This dominant negative mutant should provide useful information on the mechanism of regulation of KCC K-Cl cotransporters. 500 ng of plasmid pXmKCC1 encoding wild type mKCC1 cDNA (7Su W. Shmukler B.E. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. De Franceschi L. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C899-C912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subjected to hot start PCR in a total reaction volume of 50 μl, using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the supplier’s recommended buffer. PCR mixes lacking only primers were preheated at 82 °C for 1 min, after which appropriate primers were injected into the mix through mineral oil. The complete reaction mixes were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and then cycled through these conditions: denaturation for 45 s at 94 °C, annealing for 2 min at 60 °C, and elongation for 2 min at 72 °C. Final extension of 10 min at 72 °C was terminated by rapid cooling to 4 °C after 8–10 cycles. PCR products were analyzed in 1% agarose gels, purified from gel with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and cloned into the “T-vector” pCR2 (Invitrogen). DNA sequence integrity of the cloned PCR amplification products was verified with an ABI 373 DNA sequencer. DNA sequence analysis was carried out with the GCG suite of programs (University of Wisconsin Genetics Computing Group). Each forward oligodeoxynucleotide primer encoded the native Kozak initiation sequence of mouse KCC1 (mKCC1) followed by the desired amino acids of the KCC1 N-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The forward primers used were KCC1.ΔN46F (5′-CCAAGCGCGCGCGATGAGCCCTTTCCTTTGCCCTTTG-3′), KCC1.ΔN89F (5′-CCAAGCGCGCGCGATGACCAACCTCACCCAAGGAG-3′), and KCC1.ΔN117F (5′-CCAAGCGCGCGCGATGGGCACACTCATGGGAGTG-3′). Each of these was used for PCR in combination with the reverse oligonucleotide KCC1.E7R (7Su W. Shmukler B.E. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. De Franceschi L. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C899-C912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding each full-length mKCC1 ΔN mutant were reconstructed by a three-way ligation of appropriate gel-purified EcoRI (pCR2-derived)/RcaI-cut fragment carrying the new mutation, RcaI/SpeI-cut pXmKCC1 encoding the remainder of mKCC1, and EcoRI/SpeI-cut pXT7 encoding the Xenopus oocyte expression vector backbone of pXmKCC1 (7Su W.

The mKCC1 ΔN mutants are summarized in Fig. 1. ΔN mutant nomenclature is illustrated by ΔN46, in which the mutant initiator Met replaces wild type mKCC1 Asn46 and precedes wild type Ser47. For construction of mKCC1 C-terminal truncation mutant ΔC660, forward primer KCC1.F7 (7Su W. Shmukler B.E. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. De Franceschi L. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C899-C912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for PCR in combination with reverse primer KCC1.ΔC660R1 (5′-CTAGTCAGTCACTCCTTCTCGGCCCCTTG-3′), introducing a termination codon in place of codon W661. To reconstruct the plasmid encoding full-length mKCC1 ΔC660, the PCR amplification product was subcloned into pCR2, excised with NcoI/SpeI, and ligated with the complementary NcoI/SpeI-cut fragment of pXmKCC1. All other mKCC1 ΔC mutants were constructed by digestion at a convenient restriction site within the mKCC1 coding region (AflII for ΔC698, PmlI for ΔC805, HincII for ΔC940, or EagI for ΔC1077) and at the polylinker SpeI site. Gel-purified DNA was blunted and recircularized by self-ligation. These internal deletion plasmids added the following polylinker-encoded C-terminal amino acids to the mKCC1 coding regions: Asn to ΔC698, Phe to ΔC940, and Pro-Ser-Asp to ΔC805 and to ΔC1077. ΔCmutant nomenclature is illustrated by ΔC1077, in which the last wild type amino acid prior to the polylinker-encoded residues is mKCC1 Gly1077. The double mutant ΔN117/ΔC805 was constructed by ligation of the NcoI-XbaI backbone fragment of ΔN117 with the complementary NcoI-XbaI fragment of ΔC805. Rat KCC2 cDNA (10Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J.

The 5′-primer used was 5′-CGGAGCCATGCCCACGAACTTTACGGTG-3′, derived from GenBankTMentry AF087436. The 3′-primer was KCC1.CT (7Su W. Shmukler B.E. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. De Franceschi L.

A fragment encoding the hKCC1 splice variant lacking exon 18 (ΔEx18) was amplified from 293T cell RNA by RT-PCR using as primers KCC1.E16F and KCC1.E21R (7Su W. Shmukler B.E. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. De Franceschi L. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C899-C912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The subcloned variant fragment was reconstructed into the pXT7-hKCC1 backbone by SacII-SpeI (pCR2-derived) restriction and ligation. All cDNAs were subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pXT7 (7Su W. Shmukler B.E. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. De Franceschi L. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Am. J.

In vitrotranslation of polypeptide labeled with Tran35S-Label (ICN) was performed with the nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega) in a 25-μl reaction volume, per manufacturer’s protocol. Alternatively, coupled transcription-translation (TnT; Promega) was used. The reaction was terminated, and microsomes were solubilized by the addition of 80 μl of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorography was as described (7Su W. Shmukler B.E. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. De Franceschi L. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C899-C912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Female Xenopus anesthetized with 0.17% Tricaine were subjected to partial ovariectomy. Excised, minced ovarian segments were incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking at room temperature in 2 mg/ml type A collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in ND 96, pH 7.4, containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Hepes, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, supplemented with 5 mg/100 ml gentamicin. Washed, manually defolliculated oocytes of stage V–VI were maintained at 19 °C. On the same day or the next day, oocytes were microinjected (Drummond manual microinjector) with 50 nl of water or solution containing 12.5 ng or the indicated quantity of cRNA. Oocytes were maintained in ND-96 plus gentamicin at 19 °C for 2–10 days, with daily change of medium (24Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Vandorpe D.H. Hand M. Crest M. Strange K. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), until used for ion transport assays. mKCC1 function was assessed by measurement of 86Rb+ uptake into oocytes 4–10 days post-cRNA injection. Groups of 5–15 oocytes were preincubated in influx medium lacking isotope. The 60-min influx period was initiated by transfer of oocytes into 150 μl of medium containing 2.5–5 mCi of 86RbCl. 86Rb influx was terminated by five 50-ml washes at 4 °C in chloride-free medium lacking isotope. 86Rb content of individual oocytes was determined in a γ counter (Cobra AutoGamma, Packard). Aliquots of influx medium were counted for determination of specific activity. All media contained 5 μm bumetanide and 200 μm ouabain to inhibit endogenous NKCC and Na,K-ATPase activities, respectively. Isotonic media were ND-96 or NMDG-96 (in which N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride substituted for sodium); results with either medium were indistinguishable. Chloride-free media contained gluconate salts. Hypotonic medium was NMDG-72. NEM was used at 1 mm. Data for86Rb+ uptake were expressed as nmol of K+ × oocyte−1 × h−1 and presented as means ± S.E. for n experiments, each evaluating 5–25 individual oocytes. From a total of 84 independent experiments, five experiments were eliminated from analysis because of poor oocyte expression of wild type mKCC1 (a mean value of hypotonically activated 86Rb+ uptake of <0.18 nmol of K+ × oocyte−1 × h−1, representing >2.7 S.D. below the mean). Among the total of 79 experiments analyzed, hypotonic stimulation was studied in 70 experiments, and stimulation by NEM was studied in 15 experiments. Group means were analyzed by two-tailed t tests, with correction for the 71 a priori meaningful pairwise comparisons (Microsoft Excel). p values so calculated were considered significant when <0.05. 2–4 oocytes were suspended at 4 °C in oocyte lysis buffer (20 μl/oocyte) containing 1% Triton X-100, Complete® protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8, 250 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 30 min of vigorous shaking at 4 °C, the extract was centrifuged 30 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Clarified lysate was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6 or 8% gels). Protein was subjected to immunoblot with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to mKCC1 N-terminal aa 1–14 and to mKCC1 C-terminal aa 1074–1085 and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (7Su W.

Oocytes were coinjected with 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (1 mCi/ml) and with cRNA or water. 2–4 days later, groups of ∼10 oocytes were manually homogenized at 4 °C in oocyte lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl (10 μl/oocyte) in a microcentrifuge tube with a fitted Teflon pestle (Kontes) and then subjected to 30 min of vigorous shaking and 10 min of centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Clarified supernatants were brought to 250 mm NaCl and then precleared with 5% normal rabbit serum. Precleared supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified anti-KCC1 antibodies (in the presence of 0.5% SDS only for anti-C-terminal antibodies), and immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose. Pellets were washed at 4 °C six times in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 ml NaCl and six more times in 1 ml of buffer without NaCl and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorography (25Chernova M.N.

The same immunoprecipitation protocols were followed using 1% Triton X-100 extracts of wild type KCC1 and ΔN117 KCC1 after in vitro translation in the presence of pancreatic microsomes of [35S]methionine-labeled protein. All procedures except polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were conducted at 4 °C. Oocytes were subjected to three 2-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 9.0, and then incubated for 30 min in the same buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce). This solution was replaced with fresh solution, and incubation was continued for a second 30-min period. The biotinylated oocytes were washed and then quenched for 20 min in PBS containing 10 mm glycine. After three washes in ice-cold PBS, groups of five oocytes were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm, Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and Complete® protease inhibitor. After a 30-min incubation, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The cleared lysates were incubated with lysis buffer-prewashed streptavidin-acrylamide beads (10 μl) for 1 h with end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and washed three times in lysis buffer lacking NaCl and then mixed with SDS-loading buffer, electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Five days after cRNA or water injection, 6–10 oocytes in each group, along with uninjected oocytes, were fixed in 1 ml of PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at room temperature. Fixed oocytes were extensively rinsed with PBS, exposed to 1% SDS for 1–5 min, and then blocked for 1 h in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% saponin. Overnight incubation with primary antibody was followed by several washes in PBS. After overnight incubation with secondary antibody and further washes in PBS, oocytes were dehydrated in methanol for 1 h and incubated overnight in BA:BB solution (23Gard D.L. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 44: 388-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4–10 such oocytes expressing a single form or co-expressing two forms of KCC1 were aligned along a plexiglass groove and imaged with the Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images were acquired from at least two independent sets of cRNA injections for each KCC1 construct. Representative images of median intensity were compiled with Adobe Photoshop 5.0. mKCC1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes was stimulated an average of 5.9-fold by hypotonic swelling (Fig. 2 A, p < 0.001; the mean stimulation of just the heterologous KCC1-mediated (water-subtracted) component of 86Rb+ influx was 8.6-fold). Even in isotonic conditions,86Rb+ influx was higher in oocytes expressing mKCC1 than in water-injected oocytes (p < 0.001). Our previous studies of mKCC1 in Xenopus oocytes (7Su W. Shmukler B.E.

Removal of only the eight C-terminal residues from the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of mKCC1, as in Δc1077, preserved a low level of activity in isotonic medium (p = 0.008) but abolished stimulation of 86Rb uptake elicited by hypotonicity. More extensive truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain after residue 940, 805, 698, or 660 abolished activity (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of oocytes with 1 mm NEM stimulated86Rb+ influx 2.1-fold in oocytes expressing wild type mKCC1 (p = 0.011) This stimulation was abolished by removal of the C-terminal eight amino acids and by all of the more extensive C-terminal truncations tested (Fig. 2 B). These mutant mKCC1 ΔC polypeptides accumulated in Xenopus oocytes to levels lower than for WT KCC1; ΔC940 polypeptide failed to accumulate to any detectable level (Fig. 3, A and B). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-mKCC1 anti-peptide antibody directed against either cytoplasmic N-terminal aa 1–14 (αNT) or cytoplasmic C-terminal aa 1074–1085 residues of mKCC1 (αCT) detected wild type mKCC1 at or near the cell surface (Fig. 3 B). αCT antibody staining was greatly reduced in oocytes expressing mKCC1 ΔC1077 and was lost in oocytes expressing other ΔC mutants. However, αNT staining suggested that ΔC1077, ΔC805, and ΔC660 retained considerable expression at or near the oocyte surface despite their loss of transport activity (Fig. 3 B). The absence of staining in oocytes injected with mKCC1 ΔC940 (Fig. 3 B) correlated with the absence of polypeptide on immunoblot (Fig. 3 A). mKCC1 ΔC698 did not accumulate detectably at the oocyte surface despite its modest accumulation within the oocyte. Following construction and functional analysis of these engineered mKCC1 ΔC mutants, we found in the data base a variant hKCC1 transcript, expressed sequence tag AI 799106. The presence of the variant transcript was confirmed in human RNA from 293T cells (by DNA sequence) and in placenta and T84 cells (by RT-PCR with two primer pairs). In this transcript, selective deletion of exon 18 (hKCC1 ΔEx18) encodes a polypeptide in which Q747 (the terminal codon of exon 17) is followed by 33 novel, exon 19-encoded, frameshifted amino acid residues before termination at position 780 (GenBankTMnumber AY026038). As is true for the engineered mKCC1 ΔCpolypeptides, this physiological hKCC1 ΔC variant exhibited no detectable transport function in Xenopusoocytes (not shown). However, no ΔEx18 form of mKCC1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in mouse brain, heart, kidney, ES cells, and MEL cells. The absence of the N-terminal 46 residues of mKCC1 (ΔN46 mKCC1) led to 86Rb+ influx indistinguishable from that of WT mKCC1 but greater than in water-injected controls (Fig. 4, p < 0.001). ΔN46 mKCC1 exhibited diminished hypotonic activation of86Rb+ influx, 47% of wild type levels representing 3.3-fold stimulation of mKCC1-mediated influx (p ≤ 0.004 compared with hypotonically treated wild type mKCC1-expressing or water-injected oocytes; p < 0.05 for simple pairwise comparison with isotonic conditions, but >0.05 when corrected for 71 such comparisons). More extensive N-terminal deletion of 89 (ΔN89) or 117 residues (ΔN117) completely abolished activation of86Rb+ influx by hypotonicity (Fig. 4 A). The 1.6-fold stimulation by NEM of86Rb+ influx into oocytes expressing mKCC1 ΔN46 was not statistically significant."

Whereas the ligand-free receptor is characterized by its association with the molecular chaperone hsp90, exposure to ligand initiates a multistep activation process involving nuclear translocation, dissociation from the hsp90 complex, and dimerization with its partner protein Arnt. In this study, we have characterized a dioxin receptor deletion mutant lacking the minimal ligand-binding domain of the receptor. This mutant did not bind ligand and localized constitutively to the nucleus. However, this protein was functionally inert since it failed to dimerize with Arnt and to bind DNA. In contrast, a dioxin receptor deletion mutant lacking the minimal PAS B motif but maintaining the N-terminal half of the ligand-binding domain showed constitutive dimerization with Arnt, bound DNA, and activated transcription in a ligand-independent manner. Interestingly, this mutant showed a more potent functional activity than the dioxin-activated wild-type receptor in several different cell lines.

Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Although disruption of the dioxin receptor gene in mice has not yielded conclusive results, it remains a possible scenario that physiological mechanisms may exist for activation of receptor function,e.g. during critical stages of vertebrate development (2Fernandez-Salguero P.

However, an endogenous ligand for the receptor has not yet been identified, suggesting that alternative pathways for receptor activation may exist. In the absence of ligand, the dioxin receptor is generally found in the cytoplasm associated in high molecular weight complexes comprising a dimer of the molecular chaperone hsp90, an immunophilin homolog known as XAP2 (hepatitis B virus X-associatedprotein-2)/AIP (aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein)/ARA9 (aryl hydrocarbonreceptor-associated protein-9), and the co-chaperone p23 (6Perdew G.H.

In the presence of dioxin, the receptor is converted to a functional DNA-binding species in a multistep process involving nuclear translocation, dissociation from the hsp90 complex, and dimerization with its partner protein Arnt (Ahreceptor nuclear translocator). Formation of the dioxin receptor/Arnt heterodimer is a prerequisite for DNA binding and promotes transcription of target genes including those encoding xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP1A1(1Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Both the dioxin receptor and Arnt are members of a distinct subclass of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcriptional regulators known as bHLH/PAS proteins. Members of this potent subfamily mediate diverse biological processes, including response to hypoxia, circadian rhythmicity, and development of the central nervous system (1Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 12Crews S.T.

Contiguous to the amino-terminal bHLH DNA-binding and dimerization motifs, members of this subfamily are identified on the basis of a second region of homology, the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain, originally identified in the Drosophila proteins PER and SIM, and Arnt. The PAS domain encompasses a region of ∼250–300 amino acids harboring two degenerate repeat sequences of 44 amino acids termed PAS A and PAS B, respectively, and has been shown to constitute an additional dimerization interface that can function independently of the bHLH motif (14Huang Z.J. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 15Lindebro M.C. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). More recently, additional roles in the regulation of heterodimerization and DNA binding specificities have been attributed to the PAS domain (16Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Zelzer E. Wappner P. Shilo B.Z. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the case of the dioxin receptor, the carboxyl-terminal half of the PAS domain, spanning the hydrophobic PAS B repeat motif, has been shown to harbor the core ligand-binding activity of the receptor (18Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 19Whitelaw M.L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition to binding ligand, this region has also been shown to mediate association with the molecular chaperone hsp90 (19Whitelaw M.L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for hsp90 in regulating signal responsiveness by folding the ligand-binding domain (LBD) into a high affinity ligand binding conformation (20Carver L.A. Jackiw V. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30109-30112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Coumailleau P. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.Å. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Taken together, the PAS domain appears to be a complex structure harboring a number of distinct functional activities. In our efforts to understand further the complex interplay between structure and function of the dioxin receptor, we have examined the functional activity of a dioxin receptor deletion mutant lacking the core LBD. Although this protein is constitutively localized to the nucleus, it was functionally inert on a xenobiotic response element (XRE)-driven reporter gene both in the presence and absence of ligand. In contrast, deletion of amino acids 288–421 encompassing the minimal PAS B motif generated an activated form of the receptor that stimulated transcription in the absence of ligand, demonstrating that this mutant functions as a constitutively active regulatory protein. Interestingly, this mutant showed a more potent functional activity than the dioxin-activated wild-type receptor, possibly indicating that exposure to ligand does not induce maximal activation of the receptor. The plasmids used for in vitro translation of the full-length dioxin receptor (mDR/ATG/pSP72) and Arnt (Arnt/pGem) have been described previously (23McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I.

For construction of the dioxin receptor deletion mutants DRΔLBD and DRΔPASB, pSportAhR containing full-length murine dioxin receptor cDNA (18Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Primers were designed to carry restriction sites for ClaI and XhoI, enabling directional insertion into ClaI/XhoI-digested pGem7 to give pDR1–229/Gem and pDR1–287/Gem, respectively. A dioxin receptor fragment encompassing codons 422–805 was obtained by PCR from pSportAhR using specific primers carrying restriction sites for XhoI. The resulting fragment was digested with XhoI and subcloned into XhoI-digested pDR1–229/Gem and pDR1–287/Gem to give pDRΔLBD/Gem and pDRΔPASB/Gem, respectively. Whenever possible, PCR sequence was replaced by natural dioxin receptor sequences from mDR/ATG/pSP72 (23McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.ClaI/XbaI digestion of the corresponding pDR/Gem constructs followed by subcloning into ClaI/XbaI-digested eukaryotic expression plasmid pCMV4 yielded constructs pDRΔLBD/CMV4 and pDRΔPASB/CMV4. The FLAG-tagged expression constructs pDR-FLAG/CMV4 and pDRΔPASB-FLAG/CMV4 were constructed by incorporating a FLAG tag epitope (Sigma), produced by PCR, at the extreme 3′-end of the coding sequence of the respective cDNAs. The pCMX-SAH/Y145F expression vector, encoding a modified and highly chromophoric form of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, has been described previously (25Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To create a GFP fusion construct of the full-length dioxin receptor for expression and visualization in living cells, a PCR fragment was amplified from pSportAhR using primers designed to yield a fragment of the dioxin receptor encoding codons 1–287. Primers were designed to carry restriction sites for BamHI and NheI, enabling in-frame directional insertion into BamHI/NheI-digested pCMX-SAH/Y145F. A CelII/XbaI dioxin receptor fragment encompassing amino acids 72–805 isolated from mDR/ATG/pSP72 was then inserted to provide the final construct pGFP-mDR/CMX. GFP fusion constructs for DRΔLBD and DRΔPASB were produced by digesting pGFP-mDR/CMX with CelII/NotI and replacing with CelII/NotI fragments isolated from pDRΔLBD/Gem and pDRΔPASB/Gem, thereby producing pGFP-DRΔLBD/CMX and pGFP-DRΔPASB/CMX, respectively. To produce the GFP fusion construct containing the minimal LBD of the dioxin receptor, a PCR fragment encoding codons 230–421 was amplified from pSportAhR. The primers were designed to carry restriction sites for XhoI, enabling insertion into SalI-digested pCMX-SAH/Y145F to give pGFP-DRLBD/CMX. pGRDBD/CMV4 and pGRDBDmDR/CMV4 (previously referred to as pGRDBDmDR83–805/CMV4) have been described (26Whitelaw M.L.

To construct the glucocorticoid receptor/mouse dioxin receptor deletion constructs for expression in mammalian cells, a ClaI/XbaI fragment was isolated from pDRΔLBD/Gem and pDRΔPASB/Gem and subcloned into ClaI/XbaI-digested pGRDBD/CMV4 to give pGRDBD/DRΔLBD/CMV4 and pGRDBD/DRΔPASB/CMV4, respectively.

CHO cells were grown in Ham’s F-12 medium, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For reporter gene assays, cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After a 6-h transfection period, cells were induced either with 10 nm TCDD (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) or with an equivalent volume of vehicle (Me2SO) alone. Following incubation for 48 h, cells were collected and washed with PBS; extracts were prepared; and luciferase activity was measured. Experiments were carried out in duplicate, and extracts were normalized for protein concentration. For immunoblot analysis, transfected CHO cells were collected, washed with PBS, and lysed in 50 μl of whole cell extract buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.42m NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 30 min. Following centrifugation, the resulting supernatants were used as whole cell extracts. Samples containing 30 μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection was achieved by incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma), followed by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The yeast strain GRS4 has been described previously (29Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Transformation of GRS4 with expression plasmids for the indicated glucocorticoid receptor/dioxin receptor fusion proteins together with the reporter plasmid pUCΔSS26X was carried out using a modification of the lithium acetate method (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Quantitation of β-galactosidase reporter gene activity in GRS4 transformants was carried out as described previously (22Whitelaw M.L. McGuire J. Picard D. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl.

CHO cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated sterile coverslips in 35-mm diameter dishes and transiently transfected with 1 μg of each expression plasmid for GFP fusion proteins using 2 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per dish. After a 6-h incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and incubation was continued for a further 24 h. The cells were then treated with 10 nm TCDD or vehicle (Me2SO) for 2 h, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the cells were quickly rinsed with deionized water and mounted on glass slides using Gel/Mount (Biomeda Co. Ltd.). Subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins was observed with a Leica DMRXA fluorescent microscope using the GFP filter set, and images were scanned with a Hamamatsu digital camera, processed with OpenLab Version 3.0 software, and exported as composite PICT files. For each construct and each condition, ∼200 cells expressing GFP fusion proteins were observed, and representative images are presented. At least three independent experiments were carried out for each GFP fusion protein construct. The wild-type dioxin receptor, the dioxin receptor deletion constructs DRΔLBD and DRΔPASB, and Arnt were translated in vitro in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For Arnt co-immunoprecipitation experiments, equal concentrations of the indicated in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were incubated with in vitro translated, unlabeled Arnt (5 μl) in TEG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing CompleteTM mini protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence or absence of 10 nm TCDD (dioxin) either for 2 h at 25 °C or overnight at 4 °C in a final volume of 10 μl. Protein mixtures were then precleared by incubation on ice with 10 μl of preimmune serum for 15 min, followed by an additional 15-min incubation with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose in TEG buffer supplemented with 150 mmNaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following rapid centrifugation, the resulting supernatants were incubated with 10 μl of either anti-Arnt antiserum (24Mason G.G. Witte A.M. Whitelaw M.L. Antonsson C. McGuire J. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4438-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or preimmune serum for 1 h at room temperature. Protein A-Sepharose was then added (50 μl of a 50% slurry in supplemented TEG buffer), and the samples were incubated on ice for a further 45 min. After brief centrifugation, Sepharose pellets were washed three times with 500 μl of supplemented TEG buffer, followed by a final wash with TEG buffer alone. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and chemiluminescence. DNA binding experiments were performed with in vitro translated, unlabeled Arnt together with the wild-type dioxin receptor or the dioxin receptor deletion mutants DRΔLBD and DRΔPASB as described previously (31Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. McGuire J. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 756-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equivalent concentrations of the indicated in vitrotranslated proteins were incubated with 10 μl of in vitrotranslated Arnt in the presence or absence of 10 nm TCDD for 2 h at 25 °C. DNA binding reactions were carried out by the addition of a 36-base pair 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the XRE1 motif of the rat CYP1A1promoter (32Cuthill S. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in 10 mm Hepes, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.08% (w/v) Ficoll in a final volume of 40 μl containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) nonspecific competitor DNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following incubation for 20 min at 25 °C, protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4% low ionic strength native polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer at 30 mA and analyzed by autoradiography. Ligand binding assays were carried out essentially as described previously using a modified hydroxylapatite adsorption assay (21Coumailleau P. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.Å. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25291-25300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal concentrations of the in vitro translated, unlabeled wild-type dioxin receptor or the indicated dioxin receptor deletion mutants were made up to a final volume of 10 μl with blank reticulocyte lysate translation mixture, followed by dilution with 3 volumes of TEG buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The reaction mixtures were then incubated with 1 nm[3H]TCDD (40 Ci/mmol; Chemsyn, Lenexa, KS) in the presence or absence of a 150-fold molar excess of the specific competitor tetrachlorodibenzofuran at room temperature for 90 min. Following incubation, the reaction mixtures were treated with 50 μl of a 10% slurry (v/v) of dextran-coated charcoal in TEG buffer for 5 min on ice, followed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatants were then incubated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry (v/v) of hydroxylapatite in TEG buffer on ice for 30 min. Following rapid centrifugation, the supernatants were discarded, and the remaining pellets were washed four times with 500 μl of ice-cold TEG buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. The pellets were eluted by incubating twice with 500 μl of ethanol, and the pooled supernatants were analyzed by scintillation counting. In the absence of ligand, the dioxin receptor exists in the cytoplasm in a latent, non-DNA-binding form characterized by association with the heat shock protein hsp90. Exposure to ligand results in rapid nuclear accumulation of the receptor and conversion to a heterodimeric complex with Arnt, a form that is now competent to bind DNA and to initiate the transcription of target genes (1Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Thus, the initial step in the activation of dioxin receptor function is binding of ligand. In addition to being a critical determinant of ligand-binding activity, the LBD of the dioxin receptor has also been postulated to be involved in the repression of a number of receptor activities that map outside the LBD itself such as dimerization with Arnt, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity (19Whitelaw M.L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Whitelaw M.L. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12697-12703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It has not yet been determined how the ligand-binding domain modulates this repressive activity. However, since hsp90 binding has been shown to colocalize within this region, it has been suggested that hsp90 itself may function as the agent of repression either by steric interference or by misfolding of adjacent structures (19Whitelaw M.L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Whitelaw M.L. McGuire J. Picard D. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We were interested to determine whether deletion of the minimal region of the dioxin receptor harboring the ligand- and hsp90-binding activities of the receptor would result in a protein that was uncoupled from regulation by dioxin. To this end, we have examined the functional activities, both in vitro and in vivo, of a dioxin receptor deletion mutant (DRΔLBD) lacking the core-delineated LBD that is located between amino acids 230 and 421 (19Whitelaw M.L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Coumailleau P. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.Å. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25291-25300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and that spans the C-terminal half of the PAS domain of the mouse dioxin receptor (Fig. 1 A). In control experiments,in vitro translation of DRΔLBD in rabbit reticulocyte lysate resulted in a protein that had lost the ability to bind ligand, consistent with deletion of the minimal domain required for high affinity ligand binding of the dioxin receptor (data not shown). Furthermore, in a specific co-immunoprecipitation assay using monoclonal anti-hsp90 antibodies, this protein showed only low levels of interaction with hsp90 (data not shown) that were attributed to non-LBD interactions via the bHLH motif (31Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. McGuire J. Gustafsson J.Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 756-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been identified in the N terminus of the dioxin receptor, incorporating basic residues within the DNA-binding domain of the bHLH motif. This single N-terminal NLS motif has been shown to be sufficient to mediate ligand-inducible nuclear import of the dioxin receptor in the context of the full-length protein (34Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Using expression vectors carrying GFP fused in frame with either the full-length mouse dioxin receptor or the dioxin receptor deletion mutant DRΔLBD, we examined the effect of deletion of the minimal LBD on intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor in living cells. In control experiments, transient transfection of CHO cells with the parental GFP construct alone revealed a uniform distribution of fluorescence throughout the cell that was unaffected by the presence of ligand (Fig. 1 B). Transient expression of the GFP-dioxin receptor fusion construct resulted in a similar distribution as the parental GFP vector alone in untreated cells. As expected, upon exposure to ligand, fluorescence rapidly accumulated in the nuclear compartment of the cell (Fig. 1 B) (34Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 35Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol.

In contrast, however, expression of the GFP-DRΔLBD fusion construct showed constitutive nuclear localization in CHO cells even in the absence of ligand (Fig. 1 B). Thus, deletion of the minimal LBD was sufficient to unmask the potent constitutive NLS activity contained within the remaining structure of the receptor. Furthermore, expression of a GFP fusion construct containing the minimal LBD of the dioxin receptor encompassing a"

In this study, we determined the molecular mechanisms by which apicidin induced the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene expression in HeLa cells. Apicidin induced p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA independent of the de novo protein synthesis and activated the p21WAF1/Cip1promoter through Sp1–3 site located at −82 and −77 relative to the transcription start site. This transcriptional activation appears to be mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), because calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, significantly attenuated the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter via Sp1 sites, which was accompanied by a marked suppression of p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA and protein expression induced by apicidin. Consistent with the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter by apicidin, apicidin treatment led to the translocation of PKCε from cytosolic to particulate fraction, which was reversed by pretreatment with calphostin C, indicating the involvement of PKC in the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 via Sp1 sites by apicidin. However, the PKC-mediated transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 by apicidin appears to be independent of the histone hyperacetylation, because apicidin-induced histone hyperacetylation was not affected by calphostin C. Furthermore, a PKC activator, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, alone induced the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter, p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA, and protein expression without induction of the histone hyperacetylation, suggesting that the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 by apicidin might have been mediated by a mechanism other than chromatin remodeling through the histone hyperacetylation. Taken together, these results suggest that the PKC signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional activation of the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene by apicidin. We previously reported that apicidin, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells via induction of p21WAF1/Cip1.

Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), its expression could be also up-regulated p53-independently by various stimuli, including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (12Hu P.P. Shen X. Huang D. Liu Y. Counter C. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35381-35387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), tamoxifen (13Lee T.H. Chuang L.Y. Hung W.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3766-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), progesterone (14Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol.

Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recent accumulating evidence suggests that the p53-independent induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 by these stimuli could be influenced by signal transduction pathways that mediate cell growth, differentiation, and stress response. For example, it has been reported that the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 by TGF-β requires MEK pathway including Ras, Raf-1, and MEK, upstream regulators of mitogen-activated protein kinase, in human keratinocyte HaCaT cell (12Hu P.P. Shen X. Huang D. Liu Y. Counter C. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35381-35387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). On the other hand, tamoxifen-induced p21WAF1/Cip1 expression has been shown to be mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) in H358 human lung cancer cells (13Lee T.H. Chuang L.Y. Hung W.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3766-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 is one of the common phenomena observed after treatment with HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA), sodium butyrate (NaB), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), oxamflatin, and MS-27–275 (16Richon V.M.

The transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 by these HDAC inhibitors has been proposed to be regulated by the chromatin remodeling resulting from the accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 in p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter region. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that p21WAF1/Cip1 induction by HDAC inhibitors was mediated via Sp1 sites through Sp1 family transcription factors, Sp1 and/or Sp3 (17Nakano K. Mizuno T.

However, there has been no study addressing the possible link between the transcriptional activation of the p21WAF1/Cip1gene expression by HDAC inhibitor and signal transduction pathway. Recently, we reported that apicidin, a HDAC inhibitor, inhibits proliferation of various tumor cells with a broad spectrum of antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines (22Han J.W. Ahn S.H. Park S.H. Wang S.Y. Bae G.U. Seo D.W. Kwon H.K. Hong S. Lee H.Y. Lee Y.W. Lee H.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6068-6074PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, apicidin showed a detransforming activity against HeLa cells that was accompanied by an accumulation of hyperacetylated histone H4 in vivo as well as inhibition of partially purified HDAC in vitro. Consistent with antiproliferative activity and detransforming activity of apicidin, apicidin selectively up-regulated the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 and gelsolin, which allow tumor cells to undergo cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and morphological changes, respectively (22Han J.W. Ahn S.H. Park S.H. Wang S.Y. Bae G.U. Seo D.W. Kwon H.K. Hong S. Lee H.Y. Lee Y.W. Lee H.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6068-6074PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanism of apicidin-induced transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 and the possible involvement of protein kinase signaling pathway in the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene expression. Apicidin induced p21WAF1/Cip1 gene expression independent of the de novo protein synthesis through Sp1–3 site located at −82 and −77 relative to the transcription start site of p21WAF1/Cip1. Moreover, pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, significantly attenuated the apicidin-induced activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter, expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA and protein, and translocation of PKCε from cytosolic to particulate fraction. Taken together, these results suggest that PKC signal transduction pathway is involved in the apicidin-induced transcriptional activation of the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene expression via Sp1 sites. Human cervix cancer cell line HeLa was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Apicidin, [cyclo(N-O-methyl-l-tryptophanyl-l-isoleucinyl-d-pipecolinyl-l-2-amino-8-oxodecanoyl)], was prepared from Fusarium sp. strain KCTC 16677 according to the method described previously (23Park J.S.

PD98059, H-89, calphostin C, rottlerin, and PDBu were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOLreagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Integrity of RNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. One microgram of RNA was used as a template for each RT-PCR using RNA PCR kit (Perkin Elmer). Primer sequences for p21WAF1/Cip1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were described previously (19Kim Y.B. Lee K.H. Sugita K. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S.

The human wild-type p21WAF1/Cip1promoter-luciferase fusion plasmid, WWP-Luc, was a kind gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Johns Hopkins University). The full-length human p21WAF1/Cip1promoter-luciferase reporter construct, pWWP, a series of mutant p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter constructs including pWP124, pWP101, pWP101-mtSp1–3, pWP101-mtSp1–4, pWP101-mtSp1–5,6 ,and pWP101-mtTATA were kind gifts from Dr. Yoshihiro Sowa (Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine). pWPdel-SmaI was generated by digesting pWWP with S maI and by religating. HeLa cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105/well and incubated for 24 h. For p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter analysis, the cells were transfected with 5 μg/well of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter reporter plasmid DNA by using ProFection transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four h after the transfection, the medium was changed for medium with or without 1 μm apicidin, and cell lysates were collected for the luciferase assay 24 h later. The luciferase activities of the cell lysates were measured according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Promega). HeLa cells were partitioned into soluble (cytosolic) and particulate fractions. HeLa cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mmNaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 15 mm sodium PPi, 30 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized for 10 s at 6,000 rpm. The cytosolic and particulate fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and formed the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 30 min, cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and formed the particulate fraction. HeLa cell lysates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min, and 30 μg of each total protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% slab gels for the analysis of p21WAF1/Cip1 and β-tubulin and 10% slab gels for the analysis of PKC isoforms. For immunodetection of acetylated histone H3, histone fractions were isolated by the established techniques (22Han J.W. Ahn S.H. Park S.H. Wang S.Y. Bae G.U. Seo D.W. Kwon H.K. Hong S. Lee H.Y. Lee Y.W. Lee H.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6068-6074PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to 10–20% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were blocked for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) dry skim milk powder and incubated overnight with anti-p21WAF1/Cip1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.), β-tubulin (BD PharMingen, Inc.), acetylated histone H3, H4 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), PKC isoform (α, βI, βII, ε, η, μ, ι, θ, γ and δ; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.), and PKCζ (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) antisera. The membranes were then washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with an anti-rabbit or an anti-mouse secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with the enhanced amplified alkaline phosphatase immunoblot system (Bio-Rad). Previously, we demonstrated that p21WAF1/Cip1, which controls the cell cycle, was markedly up-regulated by apicidin in HeLa, human cervix cancer cell lines (22Han J.W. Ahn S.H. Park S.H. Wang S.Y. Bae G.U. Seo D.W. Kwon H.K. Hong S. Lee H.Y. Lee Y.W. Lee H.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6068-6074PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism by which apicidin induces p21WAF1/Cip1, we first analyzed the effect of apicidin on the p21WAF1/Cip1 expression in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), apicidin treatment induced p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner as determined by RT-PCR analysis and consequently increased p21WAF1/Cip1 protein levels. The level of p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA was slightly increased at 0.01 μm and more markedly at 0.1 μm. In addition, induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 by apicidin was not affected by pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, which alone did not alter p21WAF1/Cip1expression, indicating that the de novo protein synthesis was not necessary for p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA expression by apicidin. The observation of no demand for new protein synthesis in the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA by apicidin could be supported by other reports using known HDAC inhibitors such as NaB and SAHA (18Huang L. Sowa Y. Sakai T. Pardee A.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5712-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Miyaishi O. Ohkusu K. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because apicidin drastically induced the p21WAF1/Cip1mRNA expression, we then investigated whether apicidin could stimulate the activity of the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene promoter in cells transiently transfected by 2.4-kilobase wild-type p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter-luciferase fusion plasmid, WWP-Luc. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the luciferase activity was increased in a dose-dependent manner up to a 5.5-fold by treatment with 2 μm apicidin. Taken together, these results demonstrate that apicidin induces the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 protein and mRNA and activates its promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. To delineate the mechanism by which apicidin activates the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter, we first determined the regions of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter responsible for the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter by apicidin. A series of 5′ deletion constructs of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and luciferase activities following apicidin treatment were measured relative to the full-size p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter (pWWP). The pWP124 plasmid lacking the two p53 binding sites was strongly activated by apicidin up to a 9.8-fold, a level comparable with that of the full-size promoter pWWP (Fig. 2 A), indicating that apicidin activates the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter in a p53-independent pathway. This observation well correlates with our previous report that the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 is induced by a p53-independent fashion in HeLa cells (22Han J.W. Ahn S.H. Park S.H. Wang S.Y. Bae G.U. Seo D.W. Kwon H.K. Hong S. Lee H.Y. Lee Y.W. Lee H.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6068-6074PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the Sp1 binding sites are involved in the transcriptional activation by apicidin, a series of 5′ deletion plasmids of pWP124 harboring six Sp1 binding sites, pWP101 lacking Sp1–1 and Sp1–2, and pWPdel-SmaI, lacking Sp1–1 to Sp1–4 sites, were used and assayed for luciferase activity in the presence or absence of apicidin. Deletion of Sp1–1 and Sp1–2 sites did not significantly affect the apicidin-mediated activation of the promoter, because apicidin still activated pWP101 by about 9.5-fold, a level similar to that of activation by the full-size promoter (pWWP) (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, deletion of Sp1–3 and Sp1–4 sites from positions −101 to −60 (pWPdel-SmaI) markedly reduced the apicidin-mediated activation as well as the basal promoter activity over the control in pWP101, suggesting that Sp1–3 and Sp1–4 sites play an important role in both the basal and apicidin-mediated activation of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter. To further define the apicidin-responsive elements, we used pWP101 constructs with mutations in various Sp1 sites or TATA element. Although the basal activity of pWP101-mtSp1–3 in which the Sp1–3 site was mutated was similar to wild-type pWP101, the activation by apicidin in pWP101-mtSp1–3 was markedly decreased from 9.5- to 1.2-fold of pWP101 activation (Fig. 2 B). When the Sp1–4 site was mutated (pWP101-mtSp1–4), the basal activity of pWP101-mtSp1–4 was reduced to 42% compared with that of pWP101, and the activation by apicidin decreased to 25% of pWP101. These results indicate that both Sp1–3 and Sp1–4 site are important, but the Sp1–3 site is the main responsive element in apicidin-induced activation. On the other hand, pWP101-mtSp1–5,6 (mutated in Sp1–5,6) and pWP101-mtTATA (mutated in the TATA element) did not activate the promoter at all, because the basal promoter activity of pWP101-mtSp1–5,6 and pWP101-mtTATA was reduced to the background levels, suggesting that Sp1–5,6 and TATA sites were indispensable for the p21WAF1/Cip1 basal promoter activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Sp1–3 site located between −82 and −77 relative to the transcription start site is the main apicidin-responsive element and that the Sp1–4 site is also partially involved in the activation. Recent accumulating evidence suggests that the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter in response to various stimuli could be regulated by protein kinases, including PKC (25Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and PKA (26Espinos E. Weber M.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HDAC inhibitors such as NaB and trapoxin have been demonstrated to be able to activate protein kinases including ERK2 (26Espinos E. Weber M.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and PKC (27Rivero J.A. Adunyah S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These studies led to a hypothesis that the apicidin-induced transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1through Sp1 sites might be mediated by a protein kinase signaling pathway. To test this possibility, different types of well known specific kinase inhibitors, which have been usually employed as tools in analyzing specific signaling pathway, were used in this study. We first examined the role of ERK1/2 in the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter by apicidin. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 A, pretreatment with PD98059 that blocks MEK1 did not attenuate the apicidin-induced luciferase activity as monitored by a transient transfection of pWP101 as a reporter plasmid, suggesting that ERK1/2 was not involved in the apicidin-induced transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1through Sp1 sites. We then investigated the role of PKA in the induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activity. Pretreatment of a selective inhibitor of PKA, H-89, did not affect the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter via Sp1 sites by apicidin (Fig. 3 A). Taken together, these results suggest that the ERK1/2 and PKA signaling pathway may not be involved in the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter via Sp1–3 sites by apicidin. Recently, the possible link between p21WAF1/Cip1 induction by HDAC inhibitors and PKC activation has been evoked by NaB. NaB can stimulate the PKC activation during erythroid differentiation (27Rivero J.A. Adunyah S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and PKC activator alone has also been shown to induce p21WAF1/Cip1 expression (28Akashi M. Osawa Y. Koeffler H.P. Hachiya M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A. Evans S.S. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9424-9435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether PKC could be a mediator in the induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 by apicidin. Pretreatment with selective PKC inhibitors calphostin C and rottlerin markedly suppressed the promoter activity of p21WAF1/Cip1 activated by apicidin (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, treatment with a PKC activator, PDBu, alone activated the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activity up to about 8-fold in the absence of apicidin in HeLa cells. Co-treatment of PDBu with apicidin further elevated the luciferase activity but did not have a synergistic effect on apicidin-induced p21WAF1/Cip1promoter activity (Fig. 3 B). To confirm the ability to activate p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activity through Sp1–3 site by PDBu, we used pWP101 mutants, pWP101-mtSp1–3, pWP101-mtSp1–4, and pWP101-mtSp1–5,6. Consistent with the mutant analysis demonstrated in Fig. 2 B, PDBu did not induce the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with mutants, suggesting that PKC may regulate the activity of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter through Sp1–3 site (Fig. 3 C). To test whether the ability of PKC to up-regulate p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activity by apicidin is due to the structural property of apicidin, we examined the effect on the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activity by other HDAC inhibitors, TSA and NaB, that are structurally unrelated to apicidin. Using pWP101 as a reporter plasmid, we measured the luciferase activity in cells treated with TSA or NaB in the presence or absence of calphostin C. The increased promoter activities by TSA and NaB were also completely inhibited by pretreatment with calphostin C, comparable with the inhibitory effect of calphostin C on apicidin-induced promoter activities (Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that the PKC signal transduction pathway might be contributed to the p21WAF1/Cip1 transcriptional activation through Sp1 sites by apicidin and that other HDAC inhibitors might also adopt PKC as an indispensable mediator in the induction of p21WAF1/Cip1gene expression. To further examine the effect of PKC inhibitor on the induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 expression by apicidin and to test whether it can block the p21WAF1/Cip1 expression independent of the histone acetylation by apicidin, we performed immunoblot and RT-PCR analysis. The induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 protein and mRNA expression by apicidin was completely abolished by calphostin C, which occurred independent of histone hyperacetylation by apicidin (Fig. 4). Moreover, consistent with the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter by PDBu (Fig. 3 B), PDBu alone induced p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA and protein expression without causing histone hyperacetylation (Fig. 4 A, fifth lane). In addition, the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription by PDBu occurred in the absence of protein neosynthesis (Fig. 4 B, sixth lane), which was similar to the results obtained by apicidin treatment (Fig. 1 B, eighth lane). These results indicate that the induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription by apicidin is most likely mediated by PKC. To further explore which isozymes of PKC are associated with the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 by apicidin, PKC isoform specific activity was measured indirectly by monitoring translocation of PKC isoforms between cytosolic and particulate fractions, which is a hallmark of its activation (30Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). HeLa cells predominantly expressed the α, βI, βII, ε, η, μ, ζ, and ι isoforms of PKC but did not contain detectable levels of PKCθ, γ, δ, as determined by immunoblot (Fig. 5 A). Subsequently, their subcellular distribution was measured by immunoblot in cells treated with apicidin in the presence or absence of calphostin C. Although there were no consistent observable changes in the subcellular distribution or levels of PKCα, βI, βII, η, μ, ζ, or ι isoforms upon apicidin treatment (data not shown), there was reproducible translocation of PKCε from cytosolic to particulate fraction by apicidin treatment (Fig. 5 B). Apicidin-induced translocation of PKCε was, however, reversed by pretreatment with calphostin C, which was correlated with inhibitory effect of calphostin C on apicidin-induced expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA and protein (compare Figs. 4 and 5). Taken together, these results suggest that PKCε may play an important role in the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 by apicidin. Among the genes that are directly transcriptionally up-regulated in cells treated with HDAC inhibitors is the Cdk inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1. It binds and inhibits cyclin/Cdk complexes, resulting in tumor cell cycle arrest. It has been proposed that p21WAF1/Cip1 could be one of the better candidates for gene-regulating chemotherapy or chemoprevention, because it is less frequently mutated than p53 gene in human common cancers (31Chedid M. Michieli P. Lengel C. Huppi K. Givol D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3021-3024PubMed Google Scholar, 32Li Y.J. Laurent-Puig P. Salmon R.J. Thomas G. Hamelin R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 599-601PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7435) Google Scholar) and its induction by HDAC inhibitors is mediated by a p53-independent pathway (17Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol.

It is therefore important to understand the induction mechanism of p21WAF1/Cip1 by HDAC inhibitors in chemotherapy or chemoprevention. This study demonstrates that apicidin induced the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene independent of the de novo protein synthesis by a transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter through Sp1–3 site. Consistent with our results, other HDAC inhibitors, such as NaB, TSA, and SAHA have been shown to activate p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter through Sp1 sites (17Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the responsive element for HDAC inhibitors is also involved in the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter by various stimuli, including TGF-β (12Hu P.P. Shen X. Huang D.

Sebti S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6962-6970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), progesterone (14Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol.

Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), indicating the essential role of Sp1 sites in the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1gene. However, the Sp1 family transcription factors, Sp1 or Sp3, appear to be differentially involved in the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter via Sp1 sites depending on different kinds of inducers and cellular systems as previously reported (18Huang L. Sowa Y. Sakai T. Pardee A.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5712-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,35Adnane J. Bizouarn F.A. Qian Y.M. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Mol. Cell.

Apicidin-induced transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 through Sp1 sites does not appear to be attributed to the increase in DNA binding activity of Sp1/3, because apicidin treatment did not disrupt the interaction between Sp1/3 and Sp1–3 element (data not shown), which is consistent with previous observations from other well known HDAC inhibitors such as NaB (17Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), TSA (21Sowa Y. Orita T. Minamikawa-Hiranabe S. Mizuno T. Nomura H. Sakai T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4266-4370PubMed Google Scholar), and SAHA (18Huang L. Sowa Y. Sakai T. Pardee A.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5712-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that the p21WAF1/Cip1 transcriptional activation by HDAC inhibitors is triggered by the histone hyperacetylation in its promoter region, followed by transcriptional activation by facilitating the binding of transcription factors to nucleosomal DNA (16Richon V.M. Sandhoff T.W. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10014-10019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). In this study, however, the transiently transfected reporter plasmids harboring the apicidin-responsive elements of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter were still responsive to the apicidin-mediated stimulation in p21WAF1/Cip1 gene activation, although they did not appear to adopt a complete chromatin structure. This observation raised the possibility that the transcriptional activation by apicidin could be mediated by mechanisms other than alteration of chromatin structure, such as post-translational modification of Sp1/3 by a protein kinase signaling pathway, alteration of its interaction with other proteins, or modification of proteins directly or indirectly interacting with Sp1/3. Studies examining these possibilities demonstrated that PKC inhibitors completely suppressed not only the promoter activity but also the mRNA and protein expression of p21WAF1/Cip1induced by apicidin, suggesting that PKC might be involved in the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 through Sp1 sites by apicidin. Indeed, apicidin could translocate only PKCε among the PKC isoforms expressed in HeLa cells from cytosolic to particulate fraction, indicating a selective activation of PKCε by apicidin, as previously reported with other HDAC inhibitor in human K562 erythroleukemia cells (27Rivero J.A. Adunyah S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apicidin-induced translocation of PKCε from the cytosolic to particulate fraction was reversed by pretreatment with calphostin C, which was accompanied by an inhibition of p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA and protein expression as well as its promoter activity by pretreatment with calphostin C. However, little is known about how apicidin activates PKCε through translocation from the cytosol to the membrane. We could not also rule out the possibility that apicidin induced translocation of PKCε from the cytosol to the nucleus as previously observed with NaB (27Rivero J.A. Adunyah S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our results could be further supported by other observations that the induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 was up-regulated by PKC activator phorbolester (25Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and that the induction of p21WAF1/Cip1gene could be regulated by the Sp1 and 3 phosphorylation in response to geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor GGTI-298 (35Adnane J. Bizouarn F.A. Qian Y.M. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6962-6970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although well known HDAC inhibitors including apicidin have been reported to induce selective changes in the expression of few genes such as p21WAF1/Cip1 (16Richon V.M. Sandhoff T.W. Rifkind R.A.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 931-934PubMed Google Scholar), whether apicidin generally up-regulates all genes with Sp1 binding sites remains to be unraveled. This identification would be important to elucidate the role of PKC in regulation of whole new categories of genes. The ability of PKC to up-regulate p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activity by apicidin appears not to be due to the structural property of apicidin, because the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter by other HDAC inhibitors, TSA and NaB, that are structurally unrelated to apicidin, was also completely suppressed by pretreatment with calphostin C, indicating that HDAC may be still the main target of apicidin. However, the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 by apicidin might be mediated by hyperacetylation of nonhistone proteins rather than chromatin remodeling through histone hyperacetylation, because calphostin C could block p21WAF1/Cip1 expression independent of histone acetylation by apicidin. This view may be supported by the fact that the function of the nonhistone protein such as E2F transcription factor may be regulated by reversible acetylation (39Marzio G. Wagener C. Gutierrez M.I. Cartwright P. Helin K. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10887-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To clarify the possible link between acetylation of nonhistone proteins and the protein kinase signaling pathway would thus be of great interest. In summary, we demonstrated that PKC might be an important mediator of apicidin-induced transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cippromoter. Apicidin induced the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene independent of the de novo protein synthesis through Sp1–3 site on p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter. In addition, PKCε may be responsible for the transcriptional activation p21WAF1/Cip1through Sp1 sites, because the inhibition of PKCε translocation from cytosolic to particulate fraction by pretreatment with calphostin C significantly attenuated the activation of p21WAF1/Cip1promoter as well as the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1mRNA and protein by apicidin. To our knowledge, the results we present here are the first study elucidating the possible link between the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 by apicidin and the PKC signaling pathway. Taken together, our results provide a new insight into the role of PKC in the transcriptional regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 expression through Sp1 sites by HDAC inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2090571654,"Calpain is a heterodimeric Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease consisting of a large (80 kDa) catalytic subunit and a small (28 kDa) regulatory subunit. The effects of Ca2+ on the enzyme include activation, aggregation, and autolysis. They may also include subunit dissociation, which has been the subject of some debate. Using the inactive C105S-80k/21k form of calpain to eliminate autolysis, we have studied its disassociation and aggregation in the presence of Ca2+ and the inhibition of its aggregation by means of crystallization, light scattering, and sedimentation. Aggregation, as assessed by light scattering, depended on the ionic strength and pH of the buffer, on the Ca2+ concentration, and on the presence or absence of calpastatin. At low ionic strength, calpain aggregated rapidly in the presence of Ca2+, but this was fully reversible by EDTA. With Ca2+ in 0.2 m NaCl, no aggregation was visible but ultracentrifugation showed that a mixture of soluble high molecular weight complexes was present. Calpastatin prevented aggregation, leading instead to the formation of a calpastatin-calpain complex. Crystallization in the presence of Ca2+ gave rise to crystals mixed with an amorphous precipitate. The crystals contained only the small subunit, thereby demonstrating subunit dissociation, and the precipitate was highly enriched in the large subunit. Reversible dissociation in the presence of Ca2+ was also unequivocally demonstrated by the exchange of slightly different small subunits between μ-calpain and m-calpain. We conclude that subunit dissociation is a dynamic process and is not complete in most buffer conditions unless driven by factors such as crystal formation or autolysis of active enzymes. Exposure of the hydrophobic dimerization surface following subunit dissociation may be the main factor responsible for Ca2+-induced aggregation of calpain. It is likely that dissociation serves as an early step in calpain activation by releasing the constraints upon protease domain I.

They consist of an isoform-specific catalytic ∼80-kDa subunit (from the genes capn1 andcapn2, respectively) and a common regulatory ∼28-kDa subunit (capn4). Several other calpain-related genes are now known, but within this report, the word calpain refers only to the μ- and m-calpains. Whereas the exact physiological roles of calpains remain to be defined, many studies suggest that they have important cellular roles. They have been implicated in several important cellular functions, including signal transduction, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal reorganization (1Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K.

Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Unlike many other cysteine proteases, calpains tend to cleave substrates at interdomain boundaries, thereby serving to modulate the function of these substrates rather than simply digesting them (5Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Several probable substrates have been identified both in vitro andin vivo including p53, protein kinase C, spectrin, Ca2+-ATPase, talin, and fibronectin (4Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys.

The initial effects of Ca2+ binding to calpain include a conformational change that is essential to assemble the active site and some limited autolysis of both subunits. Further results of Ca2+ binding include aggregation of the whole enzyme or continued autolysis and degradation. The recent structure determination of m-calpain (12Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 13Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) has provided new insights into the structural basis of calpain activation by Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, the catalytic triad is not assembled so that the protease is inactive. Several structural features have been identified that maintain the active site in an inactive conformation. These involve on one side contacts between the large subunit N-terminal peptide of domain I and domain VI of the small subunit and on the other side contacts between domains II and III of the large subunit. Some of the later interactions have been clarified by mutational analysis (14Hosfield C.M. Moldoveanu T. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7404-7407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the functional implications of the binding of the N-terminal peptide to domain VI in relation to enzyme activation, autolysis, dissociation, and aggregation are not well characterized. Although there is a clear difference in the Ca2+requirement for activation (250–350 μm for m-calpain and 10–50 μm for μ-calpain), the basis for this difference remains elusive. However, the activation of both m- and μ-calpain appears to be very similar, and it was proposed that one function of Ca2+ was to cause the dissociation of the calpain subunits, a dissociation that may be reversible before autolysis but is promoted and presumably irreversible following autolysis (15Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Kitagaki H. Tomioka S. Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In two other reports, however, subunit dissociation was not detected (18Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 890-896Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Dutt P. Arthur J.S.C. Croall D.E. Elce J.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The inconsistent results stemmed from the complication of Ca2+-induced aggregation of calpain, and the difficulty in designing unambiguous experiments. In the presence of heavy precipitation, further studies of the calpain activation process will become extremely difficult. Consequently, several important aspects of the process of calpain activation and subsequent aggregation remain poorly understood. In our attempts to crystallize either wild-type or inactive m-calpain (C105S-m-80k/21k) in the presence of Ca2+, crystals were formed under certain conditions that contained only the small subunit together with an amorphous aggregate enriched in the large subunit. We therefore used light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation to search for conditions in which Ca2+-induced aggregation and possibly dissociation could be avoided. Aggregation of calpain has frequently been noted, but the factors involved have not been systematically studied (15Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K.

J. 1997; 326: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Subunit dissociation was also studied by the above methods and also by an improved subunit exchange experiment. The results confirmed unequivocally the occurrence of subunit dissociation in the presence of Ca2+ and provided some new insight into the nature of calpain aggregation. Both m-calpain and μ-calpain consist of an 80-kDa large subunit, which has an ∼62% sequence identity between the isoforms, and a 28-kDa small subunit, which is identical in the two isoforms. Upon Ca2+-induced activation, calpain undergoes autolysis in both subunits. The natural rat calpain small subunit contains 270 residues, of which the N-terminal glycine-rich region of ∼83 residues (domain V) is unstructured in the crystal structure (13Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and is rapidly removed by autolysis (20Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Hegadorn C. Maurice D.H. Arthur J.S.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this work, our recombinant calpains contain either a 21-kDa small subunit of 184 residues (domain VI), corresponding closely to the natural small subunit autolysis product (20Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Hegadorn C. Maurice D.H. Arthur J.S.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Gauthier S. Vince J.W. Davies P.L. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or an N-terminal His-tag version of this 21-kDa subunit containing 205 residues. The absence of domain V and the presence or absence of the N-terminal His-tag do not affect the stability or Ca2+requirement of the enzyme. In this work, inactive recombinant calpains were used to eliminate the problem of autolysis. C105S-m-80k-CHis6/21k m-calpain and the 21-kDa small subunit were prepared as described previously (21Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Gauthier S. Vince J.W. Davies P.L. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and stored in snap-frozen aliquots at a concentration of 10–20 mg/ml. A hybrid calpain large subunit was constructed by means of engineeredBamHI and DraI restriction sites. The resultant cDNA codes for m-calpain residues 1–48, μ-calpain residues 59–648, and m-calpain residues 637–714 (including the C-terminal His-tag). 1P. Dutt, and J. S. Elce, unpublished data. This large subunit formed an active calpain entitled m-Bam-μ-Dra-m-80k/21k and very similar to wild-type μ-calpain when coexpressed with the 21-kDa or NHis10-21-kDa small subunit. In its active form, m-Bam-μ-Dra-m-80k/21k is almost indistinguishable from μ-calpain on column chromatography and casein zymography, and its Ca2+ requirement of 120 μm is close to that of μ-calpain (∼25 μm) (m-calpain, 325 μm). The same hybrid calpain large subunit was also prepared with the inactivating mutation C115S. A recombinant form of rat calpastatin domain I with a C-terminal His-tag containing a total of 140 amino acid residues was also cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (22Maki M. Hitomi K. Elce J.S. Calpain Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, NJ2000: 85-94Google Scholar). Crystallization experiments were carried out at room temperature by means of hanging drop/vapor diffusion. Samples of C105S-m-80k-CHis6/21k calpain (10–20 mg/ml) were preincubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.2 mNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm CaCl2 at room temperature for 20 min. Incubation with 10 mmCaCl2 at a lower NaCl concentration caused immediate aggregation. A drop of this enzyme solution (2–5 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solutions containing either (a) 1–2 m ammonium sulfate, 5–10% isopropyl alcohol, and one of several buffers including 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5–5.5, 50 mmMES,2 pH 6.5, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, or (b) 20–25% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether, 15–25% isopropyl alcohol, and 50 mm MES, pH 6.5. Crystals were obtained within 3–7 days in several conditions together with substantial amounts of amorphous aggregate, and the two solids could not be readily separated. The whole droplet was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged. The clear supernatant (mother liquor) was removed, and the solid phase was washed repeatedly with crystallization buffer. The solid phase was then treated briefly with 20 μl of distilled water at room temperature, which instantly dissolved the crystals but did not significantly dissolve the amorphous precipitate. This residual precipitate was dissolved in SDS gel sample buffer, and the calpain subunit content of all the samples was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. Light scattering by C105S-m-80k-CHis6/21k calpain was observed in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrophotometer at room temperature. Both excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 320 nm, and the time-dependent change in scattering intensity was recorded. The solutions contained 70–200 μg/ml of calpain, 0–0.2m NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20–330 mm buffer, in a total volume of 3.0 ml. The buffer system was varied to alter the pH, and the CaCl2 concentration was varied from 0.1–50 mm. The volume of 3.0 ml used for conventional light scattering required too much material for studies at a higher protein concentration. Therefore, dynamic light-scattering experiments were performed at 20 °C using the DynaPro-MS/X instrument (Protein Solutions. Charlottesville, VA), which has an operating volume of 12 μl. For these experiments, protein solutions in the range of 1–5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 50 mm CaCl2 and 0.2–1.0m NaCl were used. The monodispersity or polydispersity of the solutions was assessed, and the molecular weight(s) of the predominant species were calculated. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out with m-calpain at 20 °C in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using absorbance optics following the procedure described by Laue and Stafford (23Laue T.M. Stafford III, W.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Protein solutions were exhaustively dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 200 mm NaCl, 2 mmtri-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine, and either 5 mm EDTA or 5 mm CaCl2. Runs were performed at a protein concentration of 1.13 mg/ml both in the presence and absence of Ca2+ at either 50,000 or 60,000 rpm for ∼3 h, during which time a minimum of 50 scans was taken to monitor the sedimentation rate of the protein. For sedimentation equilibrium, experiments were performed at three different protein concentrations of 0.09–0.3 mg/ml and at a minimum of two different speeds between 6000–12,000 rpm. Each speed was maintained until there was no significant difference inr 2/2 versus absorbance scans that were taken 2 h apart. To observe subunit interchange, the inactive mutants of μ- and m-type calpains, m-Bam-C115S-μ-Dra-m-80k/NHis10-21k and C105S-m-80k/21k, were dialyzed at 4 °C in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Equal amounts (0.75 mg each) of the two proteins were mixed and resolved by chromatography on a Bio-Rad UnoQ (1 ml) ion exchange column with a gradient of [NaCl] in buffer A. An identical mixture at 20 °C was adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl, incubated with 5 mm net Ca2+ for 30 min, and then quenched with excess EDTA. The mixture was dialyzed against buffer A overnight at 4 °C and resolved on the UnoQ column as described above. The protein content of the fractions was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis, Coomassie Blue staining, and by immunoblotting. Following the preincubation of C105S-m-80kCHis6/21k in the presence of 10 mmCaCl2, clusters of needle-shaped crystals appeared in droplets containing either 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0–5.5, or 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, in addition to 2m ammonium sulfate and 5% isopropyl alcohol. Crystals of the same morphology appeared, although less reproducibly in 50 mm MES, 1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 10% isopropyl alcohol. In a different experiment, very thin hexagonal plate crystals were obtained from 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 20% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether, and 20% isopropyl alcohol. Under all these conditions, no crystals were obtained from calpain that had not been preincubated with CaCl2. Crystals of either morphology diffracted x-rays to ∼3.0 Å at a rotating anode x-ray source. However, further crystallographic characterization was not possible because of twin crystal formation. SDS gel electrophoresis showed that the crystals obtained from these trials contained only the 21-kDa small subunit. The mother liquor showed faint traces of the 21-kDa protein, and the amorphous precipitate contained the 80-kDa large subunit together with a very small amount of the 21-kDa protein (Fig. 1). At low ionic strength, calpain aggregated on the addition of sufficient Ca2+, and this could be reversed rapidly and completely by excess EDTA and more slowly reversed by raising the NaCl concentration (Figs. 2, a and b). In buffers containing 70 μg/ml calpain and 0.2 m NaCl, no detectable increase in light scattering was caused by the addition of Ca2+. Aggregation at low ionic strength was also prevented by the presence of calpastatin, and in this case, the small increase in light scattering was assumed to mark the onset of the calpastatin-calpain complex formation (Fig. 2 c). The calpastatin used here was a recombinant form of rat calpastatin domain I containing a total of 140 residues (22Maki M. Hitomi K. Elce J.S. Calpain Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, NJ2000: 85-94Google Scholar). Table I lists the Ca2+requirements for these two different events and shows that aggregation of C105S-m-80k/21k calpain was dependent on the ionic strength and pH of the buffer as well as on the Ca2+ concentration. The Ca2+ concentration required in any given buffer for calpastatin-calpain complex formation was significantly higher than that required for aggregation (24Kapprell H.P. Goll D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17888-17896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table ICa 2+ requirement for calpain aggregation and for calpastatin-calpain complex formation under different experimental conditionsBuffer conditionsCa2+ requirement for calpain aggregationCa2+ requirement for calpastatin-calpain complex formationmmmm0.1 m MES, pH 6.250.20.3–0.50.1 m MES, pH 6.25, 0.1 m NaClnono0.33 m MES, pH 6.25nono0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.01–2320 mm HEPES, pH 7.50.82–30.1m HEPES, pH 7.53520 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.61–25–6100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6nonoThe calpain concentration was constant at 70 μg/ml (0.7 μm), and calpastatin (a recombinant form of rat calpastatin domain I of 140 residues) was added at a concentration of 1.4 μm. The Ca2+ requirement was estimated from the point at which an abrupt change in light scattering occurred during stepwise addition of Ca2+. The experiments were carried out at 20 °C. Open table in a new tab The calpain concentration was constant at 70 μg/ml (0.7 μm), and calpastatin (a recombinant form of rat calpastatin domain I of 140 residues) was added at a concentration of 1.4 μm. The Ca2+ requirement was estimated from the point at which an abrupt change in light scattering occurred during stepwise addition of Ca2+. The experiments were carried out at 20 °C. Dynamic light-scattering experiments were conducted at higher calpain concentrations than the light-scattering work in order to approach conditions relevant to crystallization trials. They showed that a solution of 1 mg/ml of m-calpain in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, was monodisperse in the absence of Ca2+. The major species had a molecular mass of 95–105 kDa, and ∼5% of the protein was present as high molecular mass species in the range of at least 103 kDa. At this low ionic strength, the solution became polydisperse upon the addition of Ca2+ but remained monodisperse in 0.5 m NaCl with Ca2+. With 3–5 mg/ml calpain in 1 m NaCl in the presence of Ca2+, 50–70% of the scattering intensities were contributed by the monomer of ∼100 kDa, and the remainder were provided by components of the order of 103-105kDa. The data did not indicate the presence of the homodimer of 21 kDa. Sedimentation studies also provided clear evidence of aggregation. Protein samples (1.13 mg/ml) gave rise to a sedimentation coefficient value ( s20,w0) of 5.93 in the absence of Ca2+, whereas in the presence of Ca2+ the coefficient value was 17.79. In the sedimentation equilibrium experiment, m-calpain (0.09–0.3 mg/ml) in the absence of Ca2+ showed a single molecular species of 100 kDa, but in the presence of Ca2+, multiple species were observed with molecular masses ranging from 276 to 600 kDa, suggesting the presence of a mixture of aggregates of 4–8 calpain molecules or calpain large subunits. The data again did not provide evidence for the existence of the isolated small subunit. As a control, the isolated 21-kDa small subunit protein, which is known to exist as a homodimer (25Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S.C. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), was analyzed at the same time under the same conditions. In the absence of Ca2+, it was monodisperse with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. In the presence of Ca2+, it was polydisperse with a dominant species of an apparent molecular mass of 47.5 kDa. The subunit exchange experiment depended on two factors, the separation by ion exchange chromatography of the μ-calpain-like m-Bam-C115S-μ-Dra-m-80k/NHis10-21k calpain from the m-type C105S-m-80k/21k calpain and the clear distinction on gel electrophoresis between the two different small subunits with and without the NHis10 peptide. Buffers containing 0.2 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 were used for incubation with Ca2+ to minimize the formation of insoluble aggregates. The chromatograms (Fig. 3) show that μ- and m-calpain peaks, which were well separated before exposure to Ca2+, were recovered in the same positions after a 30-min exposure to Ca2+ followed by quenching in EDTA and extensive dialysis. The peaks were less sharp following Ca2+ treatment, and the yield of protein was ∼60%, suggesting some degree of aggregation and some failure to reform heterodimers. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel (data not shown) and the immunoblot (Fig. 4) showed clearly that some NHis10-21k small subunit had been transferred from the μ-type calpain to the m-calpain, and conversely that some 21-kDa small subunit had been transferred from the m-calpain to the μ-type calpain. The conclusion is inescapable that in these inactive calpains, which cannot undergo autolysis, subunit interchange had occurred so that some large and small subunits must have dissociated in the presence of Ca2+ and at least to some extent reversibly reassociated upon the removal of Ca2+. Densitometry was not performed, but the extent of exchange appears from the immunoblot to be of the order of 30%. The nature of this experiment with a column step of relatively low recovery does not permit precise quantification of the extent of subunit exchange.Figure 4Immunoblot analysis of the eluted peaks shown in Fig. 3. Fractions spanning the two main eluted peaks in each column were analyzed by means of immunoblotting. Theleft-hand section of the blot contains samples from the column (see Fig. 3 a) previous to Ca2+ treatment, and the right-hand section contains samples from the column (see Fig. 3 b) following exposure to Ca2+. Theupper portion of the blot was treated with a mixture of a polyclonal antibody to rat m-calpain large subunit and a monoclonal antibody to human μ-calpain large subunit, which cross-reacts with rat μ-calpain. The lower portion of the blot was treated with a polyclonal antibody to the rat calpain small subunit. Both blots were treated with appropriate second antibodies and then developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. It is important to note the appearance of the NHis1021k subunit in the m-calpain peak and the corresponding appearance of the 2kDa subunit in the μ-calpain peak only after Ca2+ treatment as indicated by open arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The impetus for this work was the need to crystallize calpain in the presence of Ca2+. The structure of calpain in the absence of Ca2+ (12Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 13Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) showed that the active site was not assembled to a catalytically active conformation, so that it was clearly of interest to solve the structure in the presence of Ca2+ to understand the mechanism of calpain activation. Not unexpectedly, however, crystallization in the presence of Ca2+ raised problems of aggregation and subunit dissociation. The suggestion that the calpain subunits dissociate in the presence of Ca2+ has been the subject of some debate (15Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K.

Arthur J.S.C. Croall D.E. Elce J.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) arising not least from the difficulty of designing definitive experiments. Here we provide evidence that clearly confirms the phenomenon of subunit dissociation first described by Yoshizawaet al. (15Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in 1995. The results also suggest that in m-calpain and in the absence of autolysis, the aggregation/dissociation is a highly reversible process. The dissociation is normally not complete unless driven by other factors. Extrapolation of these clearin vitro results to the cell is necessarily speculative. It seems highly probable that the subunit dissociation is an essential aspect of calpain activation in vivo, but the ensuing aggregation observed in vitro is less likely to be relevantin vivo where calpain is diluted in a highly proteinaceous environment and where autolysis rapidly removes the activated calpain. Calpain aggregation is clearly a function of protein concentration, ionic strength, and Ca2+ concentration, but some new insights into the aggregation were obtained from light-scattering and ultracentrifugation experiments. First, within the experimental time frame (∼1 h) and in the absence of autolysis, aggregation is an equilibrium process, because it could be fully reversed by the addition of EDTA. Second, the inhibition of aggregation by higher salt concentration strongly suggests that hydrophobic interactions are involved. Although aggregation of calpain at <200 μg/ml appeared to be suppressed by 0.2 m NaCl, both dynamic light scattering and ultracentrifugation run at ≥ 1-mg/ml calpain showed that soluble high molecular weight oligomers were formed in the presence of Ca2+, which could only partly be suppressed by 0.5 or 1m NaCl. Both of these methods failed to detect the presence of the isolated 21-kDa homodimer, which was anticipated as a result of subunit dissociation. Previous work on the 21-kDa subunit showed that it exists as a homodimer both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, and that the homodimer once formed is unlikely to dissociate in any of the conditions used here (25Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S.C. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The absence of free small subunits in the light-scattering and centrifugation experiments therefore suggests that subunit dissociation is far from complete in these conditions, and that the large soluble complexes are still composed predominantly of calpain (80 + 21 kDa) heterodimers, which have undergone Ca2+-induced conformational changes leading to aggregation. It is possible to imagine a highly flexible intermediate form of the heterodimer in which the contact between the N-terminal peptide of the large subunit and domain VI in the small subunit has been lost, whereas the subunits remain at least partially attached through residual contacts between domains IV and VI. A third aspect of the aggregation studies was the inhibition of aggregation by a molar excess of a 140-residue domain of calpastatin. Separate sections of calpastatin are known to bind to domain IV in the large subunit and to domain VI of the small subunit (26Takano E. Ma H. Yang H.Q. Maki M. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems probable that calpastatin prevents calpain aggregation by binding to both subunits simultaneously and preventing subunit dissociation. Whereas m-calpain dissociation appears to be incomplete in many buffer conditions, it is clear that calpain does indeed dissociate in the presence of Ca2+ at pH 6.5 in the conditions prevailing in some crystallization droplets. In these precipitant conditions, the dissociated 21-kDa small subunit crystallized out, and its removal presumably promoted further subunit dissociation, leaving the large subunit to precipitate as an amorphous aggregate. Several crystallization conditions have also been found in which no visible aggregation of calpain occurs in the presence of Ca2+, but useful crystals, whether they are of the activated heterodimer or of the isolated large subunit, have not yet been obtained. Finally, the subunit exchange experiment also clearly demonstrated reversible subunit dissociation of calpain, because the interchange of small subunits between the m- and μ-type is only possible provided they dissociate. We had earlier failed to detect subunit dissociation by means of column chromatography of calpain in the presence of Ca2+ and by a less definitive version of the subunit exchange experiment (19Dutt P. Arthur J.S.C. Croall D.E. Elce J.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but the present experiments provide unequivocal proof of subunit dissociation. The importance of hydrophobic interactions and the effects of calpastatin support the idea that aggregation is a result of subunit dissociation. The crystal structure of calpain shows that the large and small subunits in the absence of Ca2+ are bound mainly by interactions between the fifth EF-hand motif of each subunit (12Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 13Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) in a manner very similar to that shown for the 21-kDa homodimer (25Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S.C. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,27Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Dissociation must expose the complementary dimerization interface on both subunits, which is a large hydrophobic area of ∼2780 Å2 representing approximately one quarter of the surface area of domain IV and equally of domain VI (Fig. 5). Such an exposure is energetically unfavorable in aqueous solution and would be expected to promote either “correct” reassociation of the large and small subunits or random association leading to aggregation. The exposure of this surface would be even more disfavored in solutions of higher ionic strength, which explains the partial suppression of calpain aggregation in 0.2–1m NaCl. Our modeling suggests that two large subunits could not dimerize at this site in domain IV in their correct relative orientation as observed in the domain VI homodimer because of steric interference by domains I–III. Thus, even partial exposure of this hydrophobic patch would promote the formation of randomly associated aggregates. Based on the first x-ray structure of m-calpain (12Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we proposed that the constraints imposed upon the protease domains I and II by the remainder of the molecule would act as a barrier in the activation of calpain. These constraints were provided on the one side by the small subunit domain VI, binding to the large subunit N-terminal peptide of domain I, and on the other side by a set of salt links between domains II and III. The release of the constraints would facilitate the assembly of the competent catalytic triad. We have reported experiments supporting the idea of the domain II/domain III interaction (14Hosfield C.M. Moldoveanu T. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7404-7407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and this work suggests that dissociation of the small subunit would release the constraint on domain I. The evidence of aggregation, calpastatin complex formation, and subunit dissociation suggests that subunit dissociation is the principal cause of Ca2+-induced aggregation of calpain. Furthermore, we also show that both dissociation and aggregation are reversible. Our present understanding of these events is shown in Fig. 5. Ca2+-induced conformational rearrangement and partial dissociation leads to the formation of aggregates probably containing heterodimers as well as dissociated large subunits. This step is largely reversible, but the small subunit homodimer is probably no longer available for reassociation, and larger aggregates composed almost exclusively of large subunit will be formed almost irreversibly. In the case of active calpains, aggregation also occurs in vitro on initial exposure to Ca2+, but autolysis at the same time begins to degrade the large subunits to inactive fragments. We thank L. Hicks and co-workers at the Alberta Peptide Institute, University of Alberta, for carrying out the ultracentrifugation experiments and for advice on interpretation. We also thank Dr. C. M.

Evidence obtained largely in vitro has also suggested that angiotensin II has growth-promoting effects and that it might thereby contribute to such pathological phenomena as cardiac hypertrophy, a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality.

To overcome this limitation and to test for cardiac-specific functions of angiotensin II, we generated transgenic mice expressing an angiotensin II-producing fusion protein exclusively in cardiac myocytes.

In recent years, it has been suggested that Ang II could also have direct effects on the heart, including facilitating sympathetic nerve transmission, increasing cardiac contractility, and initiating structural remodeling resulting in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (1Weber K.T.

Although inhibition of the cardiac RAS in these pathologies has shown some therapeutic benefit (5Linz W. Scholkens B.A. Ganten D. Clin. Exp. Hypertens.

These questions are the subject of much current debate because of their importance in determining treatment targets in patients with increased risk for cardiac disease (9Dzau V.J. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Animal models resulting from localized overexpression of RAS components (10Hein L. Stevens M.E. Barsh G.S. Pratt R.E.

Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have not resolved this issue either because overexpression of the enzymes involved in Ang II synthesis does not automatically result in increased cardiac Ang II formation or because Ang II production is not limited to the heart. At present, no animal model has been reported with localized genetic inactivation of RAS components. To test for tissue-specific functions of Ang II in vivo, we developed a fusion protein that can direct the release of Ang II peptide within specific target tissues of transgenic animals (14Methot D. LaPointe M.C. Touyz R.M. Yang X.P. Carretero O.A. Deschepper C.F. Schiffrin E.L. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol.

Hypertens. 2001; 14: 38.S-43SCrossref Google Scholar). Here we report on the targeted expression of this fusion protein specifically in the mouse heart, where it leads to high local production and secretion of Ang II by cardiomyocytes. Our approach is the first demonstration of in vivo genetic targeting of biological active peptides to a specific organ and allows for the first time discrimination between the local (direct) and systemic (indirect) effects of Ang II on the heart. The vectors encoding the Ang II-releasing fusion protein and the frog skin Ang II-releasing fusion protein (fsAng II), a peptide structurally related to Ang II (16Khosla M.C. Bumpus F.M. Yasuhara T. Nakajima T. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), have been described previously (14Methot D. LaPointe M.C. Touyz R.M. Yang X.P. Carretero O.A. Deschepper C.F.

Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. Am. J. Hypertens. 2001; 14: 38.S-43SCrossref Google Scholar). Expression of the fusion protein in the mouse heart was driven by a 6-kB fragment of the mouse alpha myosin heavy chain gene promoter (a generous gift from Jeffrey Robbins, University of Cincinnati) cloned upstream of the fusion protein cDNA. FVB/N mouse embryos were manipulated according to standard protocols for pronuclear microinjection (17Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar), and all subsequent breeding was carried out in the FVB/N line. A plasmid containing the tyrosinase gene was co-injected with the fusion protein construct to allow easy identification of TG mice by coat color (18Methot D. Reudelhuber T.L. Silversides D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4551-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Male transgenic mice were tested with their non-transgenic littermates at 5–6 weeks or 10–12 weeks of age. Animals were handled in accordance with institutional guidelines. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate of conscious mice were measured by tail cuff plesmythography using the Visitech Systems BP-2000 (Apex, NC) (19Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Cardiac hypertrophy was quantitated by measurement of ventricular weight and by calculating the heart weight-to-body weight ratio and heart weight-to-tibia length ratio. For measurement of angiotensin peptide in plasma and heart, blood was collected via cardiac puncture of anesthetized mice (2.5 mg of ketamine and 0.06 mg of acepromazine) in the presence of inhibitor solution (13Prescott G. Silversides D.W. Chiu L.S.M. Reudelhuber T.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma was separated at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C. Hearts were taken out, blotted on paper, and freed from atria. Ventricles were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Angiotensin peptides were extracted from plasma and tissue (13Prescott G. Silversides D.W. Chiu L.S.M. Reudelhuber T.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20van Kats J.P. Danser A.H.J. van Meegen J.R. Sassen L.M.A. Verdouw P.D.

Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The antiserum displayed 75–85% cross-reactivity with fsAng II and 100% with the Ang II metabolites Ang III and Ang IV (Ang-(2–8) and Ang-(3–8), respectively). Active plasma renin concentration was determined in plasma using an enzyme kinetic assay for Ang I generation in the presence of excess sheep renin substrate (20van Kats J.P. Danser A.H.J. van Meegen J.R. Sassen L.M.A. Verdouw P.D. Schalekamp M.A.D.H. Circulation. 1998; 98: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To measure angiotensin receptor densities (22Fareh J. Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Thibault G. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), crude cardiac plasma membranes were prepared from wild type (n = 4) and Ang II-producing mice (1B, n = 4). Competitive binding assays were performed by using increasing concentrations (10−12-10−6m) of [Sar1, Ile8]Ang II and 40–50 pm125I-[Sar1, Ile8]Ang II (2200 Ci/mmol). Binding data were analyzed with EBDA-Ligand software (Biosoft, Milltown, NJ). Extracts from plasma or cardiac tissue were injected with a tracer amount of 125I-Ang II on a reversed-phase HPLC system using a μBondapak C18 steel column of 150 × 3.9 mm with a 10-μm particle size (Waters, Milford, MA). Angiotensin peptides were separated according to a modification of a protocol described previously (20van Kats J.P. Danser A.H.J. van Meegen J.R. Sassen L.M.A. Verdouw P.D. Schalekamp M.A.D.H. Circulation. 1998; 98: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As a reference for retention times for fsAng II, Ang II, and its metabolites Ang III and IV (all from Bachem, Torrance, CA), 200–300 pg of each peptide was injected separately with a tracer amount of 125I-Ang II. Fractions were neutralized with 50 μl of 0.17 m NaOH and lyophilized before radioimmunoassay. Perfusion of isolated mouse hearts was performed to test for the cardiac release of Ang II by transgenic mice (1B and 2A; n = 4) and control (n= 5). Mice were heparinized and anesthetized (methoxyflurane), and then the heart was removed and placed in ice-cold Tyrode's buffer (23de Lannoy L.M. Danser A.H.J. van Kats J.P. Schoemaker R.G. Saxena P.R. Schalekamp M.A.D.H. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 1240-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The aorta was cannulated for retrograde perfusion in a Langendorff setup. Hearts were perfused at a constant flow of 2 ml/min with oxygenated Tyrode's buffer. Coronary effluent was collected for 25 min in a tube on ice following a 10-min stabilization period. Perfusate was concentrated on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA), and eluate was assayed for angiotensin content after lyophilization. Hearts were collected for histology after in situ fixation in Bouin's fixative and embedded in paraffin. Serial cuts of 5 μm were prepared and stained with Sirius Red to evaluate collagen content (13Prescott G. Silversides D.W. Chiu L.S.M. Reudelhuber T.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrosis was quantitated by recording 10 randomly chosen fields without arteries (magnification ×400) from the left ventricular free wall of three non-consecutive transversal sections per heart. Sirius Red staining on sections from Ang II-producing (1B, n = 6) and control (n = 4) mice was analyzed using a digital imaging system (Empix Imaging, Mississauga, Canada). Osmotic minipumps (Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA) were implanted subcutaneously in anesthetized (2.5 mg of ketamine and 0.06 mg of acepromazine) transgenic (1B, n= 9) and control (n = 9) mice, aged 12 weeks, for the administration of Ang II (350 ng/kg/min) or saline. Blood pressure was measured for 2 weeks, after which mice were sacrificed and hearts were collected for histology and assessment of heart weight. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis of tissue angiotensin levels was performed by one-way ANOVA and Dunnet’s post-hoc t test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. We generated mice in which the cardiomyocytes chronically release Ang II by making them transgenic for an Ang II-releasing fusion protein under the control of the alpha myosin heavy chain promoter. The essential features of this fusion protein (15Methot D. van Kats J.P. Lochard N. Tremblay F. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. Am. J. Hypertens. 2001; 14: 38.S-43SCrossref Google Scholar) are as follows. To ensure cell secretion of the protein, a signal peptide from human prorenin is linked to a portion of the mouse heavy chain constant region of IgG2B, which mainly provides mass to the protein (Fig.1 a). The Ig fragment is linked to the peptide of interest by a molecular spacer, a portion of the human prorenin prosegment, containing a cleavage site at its carboxyl terminus for the protease furin. After cleavage, the encoded peptide is released in the secretory pathway and secreted by the cell. The same approach was followed for localized delivery of fsAng II. This peptide, which is structurally related to Ang II (Fig. 1 b), has similar pressor and receptor binding properties to native Ang II (14Methot D. LaPointe M.C. Touyz R.M. Yang X.P. Carretero O.A.

Yasuhara T. Nakajima T. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The advantage of fsAng II over Ang II is that the proline in the amino-terminal extension of fsAng II can act as a block to degradation of the peptide by aminopeptidases (24Mentlein R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We established three independent transgenic lines producing the Ang II-releasing fusion protein (designated 1A, 1B, and 1C) and five lines producing the fsAng II-releasing fusion protein (2A, 2B, 2C, 2DA, and 2DB). In all lines, the transgene was transmitted in a Mendelian fashion (data not shown). Here we present the data obtained with three of these lines of mice (1B, 2A, and 2C), the results of which were reproduced in the other lines (data not shown). Expression of the fusion protein in line 2A led to the highest cardiac levels of angiotensin peptide (roughly 6000 times the levels in control mice), whereas we found intermediate and moderately elevated angiotensin peptide levels in lines 2C and 1B, respectively (Table I).Table ICharacterization of transgenic and control mice at 5–6 and 10–12 weeks of ageControl1B (Ang II)2A (fsAng II)2C (fsAng II)Age 5–6 weeksn = 15n = 6n = 9n = 8 BW (g)21.6 ± 0.521.1 ± 0.822.0 ± 2.221.2 ± 0.5 HW (mg)91 ± 186 ± 3155 ± 41-aP < 0.01.95 ± 3 HW/BW (mg/g)4.2 ± 0.14.1 ± 0.17.1 ± 0.51-aP < 0.01.4.5 ± 0.1 Tibia length (mm)16.1 ± 0.116.4 ± 0.215.8 ± 0.316.1 ± 0.1 HW/TL (mg/mm)5.6 ± 0.15.2 ± 0.19.8 ± 0.11-aP < 0.01.5.9 ± 0.2 Systolic pressure (mm Hg)135 ± 4144 ± 3169 ± 51-bP < 0.001 transgenic versus control.141 ± 2 Heart rate (bpm)637 ± 13677 ± 11620 ± 11653 ± 23 Plasma (fs)Ang II (pg/ml)126 ± 25290 ± 97443 ± 1031-aP < 0.01.72 ± 8 Cardiac (fs)Ang II (ng/g)0.23 ± 0.0412.4 ± 1.61-bP < 0.001 transgenic versus control.1384 ± 1231-bP < 0.001 transgenic versus control.219 ± 151-bP < 0.001 transgenic versus control.

Because angiotensins have been shown to be rapidly degraded in the interstitial space (25Schuijt M.P. van Kats J.P. de Zeeuw S. Duncker D.J. Verdouw P.D. Schalekamp M.A.D.H. Danser A.H.J. J. Hypertens. 1999; 17: 1885-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we wanted to ascertain that the Ang II we measured in the heart was intact Ang II peptide and not its metabolites. Therefore, we analyzed cardiac extracts from line 1B by HPLC. Following radioimmunoassay of the HPLC fractions, we found a single peak corresponding to Ang II but not its metabolites (Fig.2, a and b). Because recovery in our HPLC-separated fractions was >80%, our results suggest that immunoreactive angiotensin in transgenic hearts from the line with the lowest expression corresponds to intact Ang II and not its metabolites. The release of angiotensin peptide from the heart into the circulation was evident in the line with the highest expression of cardiac fsAng II (2A; Table I). Further proof for spillage of Ang II from the heart in the two lines expressing fsAng II comes from the measurements of active plasma renin concentration. Elevated Ang II levels in the circulation suppress (via a negative feedback on renal juxtaglomerular cells) the formation and secretion of renin from these cells. Renin activity was suppressed in lines 2A and 2C, whereas in line 1B it was not affected (Table I). Indeed, HPLC analysis of plasma from line 2A displayed a single Ang II immunoreactive peak, which approximates the retention time of fsAng II and not Ang II (Fig. 2 c). The small difference between the retention times of the fsAng II standard and the peptide derived from plasma extract suggests that the angiotensinase-resistant des-[Ala1]-fsAng II is the main form of the fsAng II peptide in the circulation. This result also demonstrates that endogenous Ang II production was largely suppressed in line 2A and that virtually all of the circulating Ang II (fsAng II) was derived from the hearts of these animals. Although we did not find any evidence for Ang II leakage into the plasma from the hearts of 1B mice, mounting the hearts in a Langendorff preparation showed that coronary perfusate collected during 25 min from hearts obtained from transgenic mice (1B and 2A) contained 30–120 pg of Ang II and 400–2700 pg of fsAng II, respectively. Perfusate collected from the hearts of non-transgenic mice did not contain any detectable Ang II immunoreactivity, which is in agreement with a previous study using isolated perfused hearts of normal rats (23de Lannoy L.M. Danser A.H.J. van Kats J.P. Schoemaker R.G. Saxena P.R. Schalekamp M.A.D.H. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 1240-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These results confirm that even though expression of our Ang II-releasing fusion protein in cardiomyocytes does not result in detectable increases in plasma levels of Ang II, the cardiac cells do release the peptide in vivo. To assess and compare the physiological effects of elevated cardiac (all lines) and combined cardiac and circulating (2A and 2C) Ang II levels, we measured systolic blood pressure and quantitated cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic mice and control littermates. The abundant overflow of fsAng II from the heart into the circulation led to the elevation of blood pressure in transgenic mice from line 2A at 5–6 and 10–12 weeks and in transgenic mice from line 2C at 10–12 weeks (Table I). We did not observe any alteration of systolic blood pressure in mice from line 1B as compared with control mice, and no differences were seen in heart rates between transgenic and non-transgenic mice. Increase of systolic blood pressure in line 2A at 5–6 and 10–12 weeks of age was accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy as indicated by an increase of heart weight-to-body weight ratio and heart weight-to-tibia length ratio (Table I). These hypertrophic indices were only elevated in mice of line 2C at 10–12 weeks of age, when they had developed full hypertension. We found no evidence of cardiac hypertrophy in mice from line 1B despite dramatically increased cardiac Ang II content. Systolic blood pressure in transgenic mice correlated with the degree of cardiac hypertrophy as determined by heart weight-to-body weight ratio (Fig.3) at 5–6 weeks (R 2 = 0.53, p < 0.001) and at 10–12 weeks (R 2 = 0.32, p < 0.01). We also calculated significant correlations for systolic blood pressure and heart weight or heart weight-to-tibia length ratio (data not shown). To determine whether increases in cardiac Ang II content also led to morphological changes, we examined collagen deposition by Sirius Red staining of histological sections of hearts from transgenic mice. We observed a thickening of left ventricular wall and interventricular septum (2A) and clearly increased perivascular and interstitial fibrosis (2A, 2C) in hypertrophied hearts from hypertensive transgenic mice (Fig. 4,a–h). Interestingly, we also observed a significant increase in interstitial fibrosis in hearts from normotensive Ang II-producing mice (1B). Analysis of Sirius Red staining from these sections revealed a 38% augmentation of collagen density (p < 0.05) as compared with normal mice at 10–12 weeks (Fig. 4, i–k). This finding demonstrates that Ang II in the heart directly stimulates the deposition of collagen in the cardiac interstitium. To rule out the possibility that the absence of cardiac hypertrophy in the Ang II-producing mice (1B) could be due to a decrease in cardiac angiotensin receptor density as a result of chronic local elevations in Ang II, we carried out radioligand binding assays on membrane preparations from non-transgenic and transgenic mice (1B). In normal mice, we found an angiotensin receptor density of 22.5 ± 0.3 fmol/mg of protein. The binding of 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]Ang II could largely (>95%) be blocked by 10−6 mol/liter losartan (specific angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist) but not by 10−6 mol/liter PD123319 (specific angiotensin II type 2 receptor ligand), indicating that the AT1 receptor is the major receptor type that is present in the mouse heart. In cardiac membranes from Ang II-producing (1B) mice, we did not observe a significantly different receptor density (21.5 ± 1.9 fmol/mg of protein) nor did we detect any differences in receptor affinities (data not shown). To further test whether the mice with only local cardiac increases in Ang II (1B) had lost the ability to mount a cardiac hypertrophic response to Ang II, we implanted transgenic and non-transgenic littermates with osmotic minipumps releasing either saline or Ang II during 2 weeks. We then collected the hearts of these mice, weighed them, and prepared sections for histochemistry. Systemic administration of Ang II by osmotic minipumps increased systolic blood pressure to the same extent in Ang II-producing mice (1B) and non-transgenic controls, and the rise in systolic blood pressure was accompanied by a similar elevation of heart weight-to-body weight ratio in both groups (Fig.5, a and b). We examined Sirius Red-stained cardiac sections and observed severe perivascular fibrosis extending into the surrounding tissue and development of interstitial fibrotic lesions in both hypertensive groups (Fig. 5, c–f). In the saline-treated groups, we did not see any alteration in systolic blood pressure, heart weight, or cardiac fibrosis. Thus, elevated cardiac Ang II production did not have any additional effects in mounting a response to the actions of increased circulating Ang II levels. In the present study we have used a novel technique to differentiate for the first time between the local and peripheral effects of chronic elevations of Ang II on cardiac pathologies. To do this, we have made use of transgenes that express Ang II-producing fusion proteins in cardiomyocytes. Intracellular cleavage of the fusion protein in the secretory pathway by the protease furin leads to the secretion of excised Ang II into the cardiac interstitial space.In vivo, the formation of the peptides in the heart was evidenced by intact cardiac Ang II and fsAng II levels that are 20–40- and 600–6000-fold higher, respectively, than the normal cardiac Ang II level. The substantially different angiotensin peptide levels between Ang II- and fsAng II-producing hearts might be explained by the proline in the amino-terminal extension of fsAng II, which could protect this peptide against rapid degradation by aminopeptidases (24Mentlein R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The different cardiac angiotensin levels between transgenic lines were also reflected by the degree of leakage of the peptide from the cardiac interstitial space into the circulation and its subsequent effect on systolic blood pressure. The mice with the highest cardiac overflow of angiotensin peptide (2A) had already developed hypertension at 5–6 weeks (the earliest age at which we could reliably measure blood pressure). In the line with moderate spillage (2C), the increase of systolic blood pressure was more modest and became apparent only in older mice (10–12 weeks). In mice expressing the Ang II-producing fusion protein (1B), the amount of Ang II leaking from the heart into the circulation was insufficient to affect either plasma Ang II levels or systolic blood pressure. Ventricular enlargement in transgenic mice was observed in the hypertensive lines 2A and 2C and only in line 1B following the implantation of Ang II-releasing minipumps. The augmentation of ventricular mass in these lines appears to be a consequence of the peripheral actions of Ang II rather than a result of its direct growth-promoting effect on cardiomyocytes. The inability of Ang II to directly stimulate cardiac growth is best illustrated by lines 2C and 1B. The fsAng II-producing mice of line 2C slowly develop hypertension, which only becomes significantly different from controls at 12 weeks in parallel with all the indices for cardiac hypertrophy. We could not detect any significant indication of cardiac hypertrophy at 5–6 weeks even though these animals have cardiac fsAng II levels similar to those seen at 12 weeks. Normotensive Ang II-producing mice (1B) have 20–40-fold elevated cardiac Ang II levels as compared with control without altered ventricular weights. One might argue that these mice have become somehow insensitive for the action of Ang II. However, the number of angiotensin receptors found on cardiac cells was not changed, and the augmented interstitial fibrosis demonstrates that the cardiac Ang II is indeed active. Recently, some reports appeared that aimed to study the cardiac effects of Ang II by means of targeted overexpression of RAS components in the mouse heart (10Hein L. Stevens M.E. Barsh G.S.

In all these models, cardiac hypertrophy was observed; however, this was not necessarily associated with cardiac Ang II signaling. Ventricular enlargement was accompanied with hypertension (13Prescott G. Silversides D.W. Chiu L.S.M. Reudelhuber T.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or leakage of RAS components into the circulation (11Mazzolai L. Nussberger J. Aubert J.F. Brunner D.B. Gabbiani G. Brunner H.R. Pedrazzini T. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 1324-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), thereby interfering with the systemic RAS. Our findings seem to be in disagreement with the observation that overexpression of the murine AT1a (10Hein L. Stevens M.E. Barsh G.S. Pratt R.E. Kobilka B.K. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6391-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or human AT1 receptor (12Paradis P. Dali-Youcef N. Paradis F.W. Thibault G. Nemer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) in the hearts of transgenic mice led to increased cardiac signaling of the AT1 receptor and growth of atrial (10Hein L. Stevens M.E.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) cardiomyocytes independent of blood pressure (12Paradis P. Dali-Youcef N. Paradis F.W. Thibault G. Nemer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). These models mimic a state of elevated AT1 receptor expression in the heart that may occur under pathological conditions. It has been shown that cardiac AT1a receptor mRNA level and receptor density are increased following myocardial infarction (MI) in rats (26Nio Y. Matsubara H. Murasawa S. Kanasaki M. Inada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 46-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mice with a knockout of this receptor, ventricular remodeling was attenuated and survival was improved following MI (27Harada K. Sugaya T. Murakami K. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2093-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These observations suggest an involvement of increased cardiac expression of the AT1 receptor in the development and maintenance of structural remodeling following MI. In our model, with the abundant presence of ligand in healthy mice, the number of cardiac AT1 receptors may have been a limiting factor. Another possible explanation could be that the resulting pathologies are only apparent after an extended period of time. For example, in the mice overexpressing the human AT1 receptor, cardiac hypertrophy only becomes apparent after 3–4 months (12Paradis P. Dali-Youcef N. Paradis F.W. Thibault G. Nemer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), suggesting the requirement of additional conditions, such as aging, leading to the phenotype. In the Ang II-producing mice (line 1B), no signs of cardiac hypertrophy were observed even up to 4 months (data not shown). Therefore, Ang II signaling alone is not a switch that can trigger an immediate hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes in vivo as opposed to the direct growth-promoting properties of the peptide observed in vitro (28Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Leri A. Li B. Wang X. Cheng W. Kajstura J. Anversa P. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The structural remodeling of the heart that we observed in all hypertensive transgenic mice may have arisen from both the hemodynamic and humoral effects of Ang II (1Weber K.T. Brilla C.G. Circulation. 1991; 83: 1849-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar, 30Swynghedauw B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 215-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). It has been reported that cardiac AT1 signaling is not a prerequisite in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy (31Hamawaki M. Coffman T.M. Lashus A. Koide M. Zile M.R. Oliverio M.I.

Elevated circulating Ang II levels may also induce the production and release of hormones such as aldosterone and endothelin, which are known to influence ventricular remodeling (33Gomez S.E.

In normotensive Ang II-producing mice with unaltered plasma Ang II levels, we detected a significant increase in interstitial fibrosis as compared with non-transgenic controls. This observation points to a direct effect of Ang II on cardiac cells and is in agreement with earlier reports that propose Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis independent of blood pressure (8Kim S. Ohta K. Hamaguchi A. Yukimura T. Miura K. Iwao H. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1252-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12Paradis P. Dali-Youcef N. Paradis F.W. Thibault G. Nemer M. Proc.

Interstitial fibrosis without perivascular fibrosis was present in transgenic mice following overexpression of the human AT1 receptor (12Paradis P. Dali-Youcef N. Paradis F.W. Thibault G. Nemer M.

These observations support the contention that the stimulation of pathways converging to activated Gαq proteins (e.g. Ang II, catecholamines, and endothelin) can lead to interstitial collagen deposition in the heart. Cardiac Ang II can mediate its fibrotic effects via fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes since both express the AT1 receptor (39Matsubara H. Kanasaki M. Murasawa S. Tsukaguchi Y. Nio Y. Inada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1592-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 40Matsusaka T. Katori H. Inagami T. Fogo A. Ichikawa I. J. Clin.

Res. 1993; 73: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar) and their production of collagen (42Brilla C.G. Zhou G. Matsubara L. Weber K.T. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 809-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and transforming growth factor β(43). Recently, Ang II was also found to promote cardiac aldosterone production (44Silvestre J.S. Robert V. Heymes C. Aupetit-Faisant B. Mouas C. Moalic J.M. Swynghedauw B. Delcayre C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4883-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), although it is unknown in which cell type. In our transgenic mice, Ang II is produced and released by cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the interstitial fibrosis that we observed in Ang II-producing mice can result from a paracrine effect of Ang II on fibroblasts or from other mediators that are released upon autocrine stimulation of cardiomyocytes, as previously proposed by others (12Paradis P. Dali-Youcef N. Paradis F.W. Thibault G. Nemer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar,40Matsusaka T. Katori H. Inagami T. Fogo A. Ichikawa I.

In summary, we have developed transgenic mice that express a fusion protein leading to the synthesis and release of an Ang II peptide in cardiomyocytes. Expression of the transgene led to very high Ang II levels in the heart and release of the peptide into the circulation. When released at sufficient amounts, this circulating Ang II leads to hypertension and structural remodeling of the heart, which is characterized by ventricular enlargement and cardiac fibrosis. Elevated cardiac Ang II levels alone do not directly induce cardiac hypertrophy but do increase interstitial fibrosis. Our findings are the first to discriminate between the local and systemic effects of Ang II on the heart.

https://openalex.org/W2144976939,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim transcription factor, mediates many of the toxic and biological effects of the environmental contaminant, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, which include the transcriptional activation of dioxin-responsive genes such as CYP1A1. Many aspects of this process are known; however, the mechanism of transcriptional activation and the proteins that are key to this process remain to be determined. The hAhR has a complex transactivation domain, composed of three potentially distinct subdomains. Deletional analysis of the hAhR transactivation domain indicates that removal of the P/S/T-rich subdomain enhances transcriptional activity, whereas the Q-rich subdomain is critical for hAhR transactivation potential, and the acidic subdomain by itself fails to activate a dioxin response element-driven reporter gene. Deletional analysis of the Q-rich subdomain identified a critical stretch of 23 amino acids between residues 666 and 688 of the hAhR, which are required for transactivation potential. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of this region identified a leucine residue (Leu-678), which is required for hAhR activity. Functional analysis of this point mutant revealed that it is capable of binding ligand, heterodimerization, and subsequent binding to dioxin response elements. Further, when hAhR/L678A and hAhR containing only the acidic subdomain were overexpressed they acted as dominant negative receptors and repressed wild-type hAhR activity. In addition, the hAhR/L678A failed to activate CYP1A1 gene transcription in transfected BP-8 cells and exhibited reduced binding to RIP140 in vitro. Thus, Leu-678 appears to be critical for efficient transactivation activity of the hAhR and appears to disrupt recruitment of co-regulators. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim transcription factor, mediates many of the toxic and biological effects of the environmental contaminant, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, which include the transcriptional activation of dioxin-responsive genes such as CYP1A1. Many aspects of this process are known; however, the mechanism of transcriptional activation and the proteins that are key to this process remain to be determined. The hAhR has a complex transactivation domain, composed of three potentially distinct subdomains. Deletional analysis of the hAhR transactivation domain indicates that removal of the P/S/T-rich subdomain enhances transcriptional activity, whereas the Q-rich subdomain is critical for hAhR transactivation potential, and the acidic subdomain by itself fails to activate a dioxin response element-driven reporter gene. Deletional analysis of the Q-rich subdomain identified a critical stretch of 23 amino acids between residues 666 and 688 of the hAhR, which are required for transactivation potential. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of this region identified a leucine residue (Leu-678), which is required for hAhR activity. Functional analysis of this point mutant revealed that it is capable of binding ligand, heterodimerization, and subsequent binding to dioxin response elements. Further, when hAhR/L678A and hAhR containing only the acidic subdomain were overexpressed they acted as dominant negative receptors and repressed wild-type hAhR activity. In addition, the hAhR/L678A failed to activate CYP1A1 gene transcription in transfected BP-8 cells and exhibited reduced binding to RIP140 in vitro. Thus, Leu-678 appears to be critical for efficient transactivation activity of the hAhR and appears to disrupt recruitment of co-regulators. aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin cytochrome P450 hepatitus B virus X-associated protein aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein dioxin-responsive enhancer steroid receptor coactivator-1 receptor interacting protein 140 transactivation domain amino acid(s) glutathione S-transferase quantitative/competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction wild-type rainbow trout transcription factor N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)1 binds to and mediates most, if not all, of the toxic responses to TCDD. These include body weight loss, thymic atrophy, immunotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, porphyria, chloracne and related dermal lesions, tissue-specific hypo- and hyperplastic responses, carcinogenesis, teratogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. In addition, AhR mediates various biochemical responses like the induction of phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP1A2, and GST-Ya (1Safe S.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 371-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxcol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). The physiological role of the AhR is poorly understood; however, the generation of AhR null mice has yielded some clues. Although phenotypic differences in AhR null mice from different laboratories are evident, a common thread among the different mice is the lack of proper liver development including small liver size and fibrosis (3Fernandez-Salguero P.

AhR null mice also exhibited immune system impairment and reproductive defects including female mortality, small litter size, and death of pups after weaning (4Schmidt J.V. Su G.H. Reddy J.K.

In addition, AhR null mice failed to develop subcutaneous tumors at the site of injection of benzo(a)pyrene, which were evident in the case of wild-type and AhR heterozygous mice, indicating that the AhR is necessary for the metabolic activation of some genotoxic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (6Shimizu Y.

The AhR in the unliganded state is found in the cytosol in a heterotetrameric complex, which comprises two Hsp90 molecules and XAP2 (7Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H.

Binding of ligand results in the translocation of the entire complex into the nucleus and presumably the shedding of Hsp90 and XAP2 occurs. After translocation to the nucleus the AhR heterodimerizes with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), which resides in the nucleus (13Henry E.C. Gasiewicz T.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 618-626PubMed Google Scholar, 15Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Science. 1992; 256: 1193-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The AhR/ARNT heterodimer binds to DREs upstream of dioxin-responsive genes like CYP1A1 to up-regulate their transcription (16Kress S. Reichert J. Schwarz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,17Tukey R.H. Nebert D.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The binding of AhR/ARNT heterodimer to DREs upstream of CYP1A1 results in an AhR transactivation domain- and TCDD-dependent disruption of nucleosomal structure in the promoter-proximal regions followed by transcriptional activation of CYP1A1 (18Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell.

The details of assembly of a chromatin remodeling coactivator complex and the subsequent assembly of a pre-initiation complex are not completely understood. Certain basal transcription factors including TFIIB, TATA-binding protein, and TFIIF have been suggested to interact with the AhR in vitro (21Swanson H.I. Yang J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 671-677PubMed Google Scholar,22Rowlands J.C. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 538-548PubMed Google Scholar). Some corepressors and coactivators have been shown to interact with the AhR and/or ARNT and modulate the transactivation potential of the heterodimer. The coactivator ERAP140 and corepressor silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor interact with the AhR and ARNT and alter AhR-mediated transcriptional activation of DRE-driven reporter genes (23Nguyen T.A. Hoivik D. Lee J.E. Safe S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized the interaction of SRC-1 and RIP140 with the AhR TAD in vitroand in intact cells (24Kumar M.B. Perdew G.H. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 273-286PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kumar M.B. Tarpey R.W. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22155-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Both SRC-1 and RIP140 enhance transcriptional activation of DRE-driven reporter genes in a TCDD- and AhR-dependent manner in various cell lines, although the pattern of response was dependent on the coactivator/co-regulator used. RIP140 ectopic expression led to a biphasic response in reporter gene activity, whereas SRC-1 exogenous expression resulted in increased reporter gene activity, even at higher levels of transfected SRC-1. The mechanism of interaction was also distinct in that RIP140 interacted with AhR in a TCDD- and L XXLL motif-independent manner, whereas SRC-1 interaction was TCDD- and L XXLL motif-dependent. ARNT has a 34-aa TAD, which is located COOH-terminal to a Q-rich segment of the protein (26Sogawa K. Iwabuchi K. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 121: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The AhR TAD, on the other hand, is more complex. The mouse AhR TAD has been studied extensively and can be divided into three subdomains: acidic-rich (aa 515–583), proline-rich (aa 643–740), and serine-rich (aa 726–805) (19Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3497-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the case of the mouse AhR, all three subdomains were potent transcriptional activators of the mouse CYP1A1 gene. The human AhR TAD also contains three subdomains: an acidic subdomain (aa 500–600), a Q-rich subdomain (aa 600–713), and a P/S/T subdomain (aa 713–848) (22Rowlands J.C. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 538-548PubMed Google Scholar). When tested in a yeast-based reporter gene assay, each of the three subdomains by themselves exhibit low levels of transactivation; however, any combinations of two of the subdomains can synergistically activate a reporter gene (23Nguyen T.A. Hoivik D. Lee J.E. Safe S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In previous reports, we have characterized the binding of SRC-1 and RIP140 to each of, or combinations of, the three subdomains of the hAhR (24Kumar M.B. Perdew G.H. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 273-286PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kumar M.B. Tarpey R.W. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22155-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Q-rich subdomain appears to be required for in vitro recruitment of SRC-1 and RIP140 to the TAD; however, an important role of the other subdomains cannot be completely ruled out. In this study, we have characterized the transactivation potential of critical regions of the AhR TAD within the context of the AhR/ARNT heterodimer. We have found that the Q-rich TAD of the AhR was critical for transcriptional activation of dioxin-responsive genes. Detailed analysis of the Q-rich TAD indicated that the residues between aa 663 and 688 were necessary for transactivation, whereas the P/S/T-rich region appeared to be dispensable. Alanine scanning mutagenesis identified a critical leucine residue, Leu-678, which is required for efficient AhR transactivation potential. These findings underscore the critical role of the Q-rich region of the AhR in mediating transactivation activity. The plasmid pEF-V5-hAhR was generated by subcloning a 2.6-kilobase pair KpnI-NotI fragment derived from pCI-hAhR into pEF-V5-HisC (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). pEF-V5-hAhR was used for all subsequent experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following manufacturer's instructions. For generation of plasmids for expression of hAhR deletions, site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit was employed to introduce stop codons at appropriate sites. COS-1 and BP8 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and Mike Denison (University of California, Davis, CA), respectively, and were routinely cultured in α-modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. BP8 cells are mutants of 5L rat hepatoma cells that do not express AhR (27Kolluri S.K. Weiss C. Koff A. Gottlicher M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1742-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). For reporter gene assays, cells at 70% confluence were transfected with a total of 1600 ng of DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) in six-well plates. Total DNA included 50 ng each of reporter plasmid, pGUDLUC 6.1, the β-galactosidase internal control plasmid, pCMV-βgal, and pEF-V5-hAhR using the following protocol for LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. Briefly, the DNA and 3.57 μl of Plus reagent were added to 134 μl of OptiMEM and allowed to incubate for 15 min. This was followed by the addition of 134 μl of OptiMEM containing 5.36 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. After a 15-min incubation of the mix, the entire volume was added to cells in each well in a six-well plate. The transfection was carried out for 3 h, at which point fetal bovine serum was added to the cells to a final volume of 10%. The transfection was continued for another 3 h, the transfection mixture was removed and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were placed in α-modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v). TCDD (10 nm final concentration) or carrier solvent was added to the medium the next day. The cells were harvested 8 h after treatment with TCDD/carrier solvent, lysed with 1× lysis buffer, and cell extracts were used to assay for luciferase activity. The luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for variation in transfection efficiencies. In the COS-1 cell line, the level of constitutive DRE-driven reporter activity obtained from one AhR transfection experiment to another varied considerably, whereas the TCDD-mediated overall activity was consistent. This effect appears to be because of the amount of AhR actually expressed in a given experiment. For determining levels of expression of the different AhR mutants and deletions, 50–100 μg of total protein from cell extracts were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-Tricine polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a membrane and subjected to Western blotting using an anti-AhR mouse monoclonal antibody, RPT1 (1:100 dilution), and a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000 dilution). Peroxidase activity was visualized using an ECL kit as described by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). hAhR and hARNT were separately in vitro transcribed and translated using the TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Translated hAhR and hARNT were mixed, and TCDD was added to a final concentration of 20 nm. The heterodimerization was allowed to occur at 30 °C for 15 min. Gel shift buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2.5% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 540 ng of poly(dI·dC) final concentration) was added to the in vitrotranslation mix along with 10 molar excess of competitor DNA as indicated in the figure. This was followed by the addition of 0.5 ng of32P-labeled DRE oligonucleotide (provided by M. Denison, University of California, Davis, CA) and 15-min incubation at room temperature at which point 1× Hi-Density TBE Sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added. An aliquot of the final mix was run on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 10 mA in 0.5× TBE buffer for 1 h. The gels were dried and exposed to film overnight. Cells were routinely maintained in α-modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v). Cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes overnight and transfected with a total of 1.8 μg of DNA/well, using LipofectAMINE and Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) The DNA mixture used for transfection contained 0.056 μg of pEF-AhR (wild-type receptor), pEF-L678A (mutant receptor), or pEF-hAhR/1–599, and 1.75 μg of control plasmid pEFV5. After 22 h, transfected cells were either treated with 10 nm TCDD or carrier solvent for 2 h. Cells were then trypsinized and collected in microcentrifuge tubes. Cell pellets were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using 1 ml of TRI reagent (Sigma). RNA was then extracted from the samples according to the method described by the manufacturer and quantitated spectrophotometrically. Transfections, RNA extractions, and QRT-PCR were done three times, independently. As controls, RNA was also extracted from untransfected BP8 cells and cells transfected with pEFV5 (control vector), followed by treatment with either TCDD or carrier solvent. QRT-PCR was performed on the RNA samples extracted according to the methods described in Ref. 28Heuvel J.P. Vanden PCR Protocols in Molecular Toxicology. CRC Press, New York1998: 41-97Google Scholar, to estimate the levels CYP1A1 mRNA. For internal standard preparation, primer sequences were as follows: CYP1A1 IS FP, TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCCCGGCTTTCTGACACAACTTCATCCACGTTCACC; CYP1A1 IS RP, TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCTTCTCGCCTGGTGACAGAAGAGCCAAGGACAGGTAC were utilized. For PCR reactions, primer sequences were as follows: CYP1A1 FP, GCCCCGGCTTTCTGACA; CY1A1 RP, CCTTCTCGCCTGGTGACA primers were used. Reverse transcription was carried out according to the protocol (28Heuvel J.P. Vanden PCR Protocols in Molecular Toxicology. CRC Press, New York1998: 41-97Google Scholar) using 100 ng of RNA per reaction tube, and PCR was carried out at 54 °C and a final concentration of 2 mmMgCl2. A range-finding experiment was done initially to determine the crossover point at which the amount of RNA molecules in the hAhR-transfected TCDD-treated sample was equal to the number of internal standard molecules. PCR products were analyzed on 2.5% agarose gels (w/v) and visualized on the Eagle Eye II system (Stratagene). Samples were analyzed based on the estimated crossover point using a standard curve. Band intensities were measured using OptiQuant software (Packard Instruments Co.). The number of RNA molecules was then determined as described previously (28Heuvel J.P. Vanden PCR Protocols in Molecular Toxicology. CRC Press, New York1998: 41-97Google Scholar). GST and GST/RIP140-(1–350) were expressed as described previously (25Kumar M.B. Tarpey R.W. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22155-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For GST pull-down assays, GST and GST-RIP140-(1–350) were pre-bound on 50 μl of glutathione-agarose for 60 min at 4 °C. The agarose pellet was washed three times in incubation buffer (25 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide,100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% CHAPS, pH 7.4 ). In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled hAhR and 500 μl of incubation buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to the agarose. This mixture was shaken at 4 °C for 2 h and washed four times with incubation buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to each agarose pellet and subjected to Tricine SDS-PAGE. The protein on the gel was transferred to membrane, and the radiolabeled protein was visualized by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. The human AhR transactivation domain has been characterized previously using a heterologous fusion protein system in yeast. The hAhR TAD was subdivided into three subdomains: the acidic subdomain (aa 500–600), Q-rich subdomain (aa 600–713), and P/S/T-rich subdomain (aa 713–848) (22Rowlands J.C. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 538-548PubMed Google Scholar). The individual subdomains possessed very little transcriptional activity by themselves when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain and expressed in yeast. However, when combinations of two of the subdomains were examined the transcriptional activity was similar to the full-length AhR TAD, suggesting a possible effect of stabilized secondary structure or recruitment of additional factors by the various domain combinations (22Rowlands J.C. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 538-548PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously examined the role of the three subdomains in physical recruitment of SRC-1 and RIP140 in vitro using GST fusion protein pull-down assays. The Q-rich subdomain in both the cases appeared to be necessary for optimal coactivator interaction. However, the role of the other subdomains cannot be ruled out in recruiting other coactivators. In this report, the role of each of the subdomains and their contribution to the transactivation potential of the hAhR TAD in the context of the AhR/ARNT heterodimer were examined in mammalian cells. Progressive deletions of the hAhR cDNA were made to generate hAhR mammalian expression vectors, which expressed either a hAhR protein with only the acidic subdomain, or a hAhR with the acidic and the Q-rich subdomains, or progressive deletions of the Q-rich region (Fig. 1). These AhR truncated mutants were tested in DRE-driven reporter assays in COS-1 and BP8 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). COS-1 cells contain relatively low levels of the AhR and thus provide a minimal background for testing the mutants. The BP8 cells are derived from 5L hepatoma cells, which do not express any detectable AhR, and hence are also suitable for testing the AhR mutants (27Kolluri S.K. Weiss C. Koff A. Gottlicher M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1742-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The deletion of the P/S/T-rich subdomain significantly increased the transactivation potential of AhR, suggesting that the P/S/T-rich subdomain may repress the hAhR transactivation potential (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the deletion of the P/S/T-rich and Q-rich subdomains together led to a significant loss of AhR transactivation potential, indicating that the acidic subdomain by itself had very little transcriptional activity. In fact, reporter gene activity dropped to 8% of levels obtained with liganded wild-type hAhR, suggesting a critical role for the Q-rich subdomain. Samples treated with carrier solvent showed minimal activity with all the hAhR plasmids tested. In the case of BP8 cells, the reporter activity in the absence of co-transfected hAhR was very low, indicating that the transcriptional activity observed is the result of transfected hAhR. Examination of the expression of various hAhR mutants using protein blot analysis indicated similar levels of expression of the AhR deletion proteins, and thus the level of expression was not a factor in the reporter gene activity obtained (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Effect of progressive truncations of the hAhR TAD on DRE-reporter gene activity in COS-1 and BP8 cells. COS-1 (panel A) or BP8 cells (panel B) were transfected in 6-well plates with a total of 1.6 μg of DNA composed of 50 ng of hAhR FL/hAhR, various deletion constructs or empty vector (indicated as control), 50 ng of DRE-driven luciferase gene plasmid, pGUDLUC 6.1, and the β-galactosidase internal control plasmid, pDJMβ-gal. The cells were harvested 10 h after treatment with TCDD or carrier solvent. Extracts were assayed for luciferase activity, which was subsequently normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as Relative Luciferase Units (RLU). The expression levels of the different hAhR deletion mutants was assayed in duplicate by running 100 μg of total COS-1 cell extracts on a 8% polyacrylamide gel (panel C). The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with an anti-AhR monoclonal antibody, RPT1, followed by ECL detection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Deletions of the Q-rich subdomain were also tested to identify a critical stretch of amino acids, which are required for optimal transactivation potential (Fig. 2, A and B). Finer deletion mutants, which resulted in AhR-(1–688), AhR-(1–663), and AhR-(1–637), were made. Upon testing these mutants in DRE-driven reporter gene assays, it was observed that AhR-(1–688) co-transfection resulted in activity similar to hAhR-(1–713) in COS-1 and BP-8 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, an additional deletion of 35 amino acids led to significant reduction in the levels of reporter gene activity to near background levels, suggesting that aa 663–688 contained critical residues required for optimal transcriptional activity of the hAhR. As expected, further deletion from the carboxyl terminus did not affect the AhR activity any further. Examination of protein blots of extracts from the transfected cells indicated similar levels of expression (Fig. 2 C). Overall, the data showed similar patterns in the BP8 cells, further reinforcing the data obtained using COS-1 cells. Having identified a critical region required for hAhR transactivation, we turned to determining the possible role of individual amino acid residues by alanine scanning mutagenesis of the region between amino acids 663 and 688. Substitutions of individual residues with alanine did not result in the inactivation of the hAhR except in the case of Leu-678 (Fig. 3 A). The replacement of Leu-678 by alanine led to the almost complete inactivation of the hAhR. All the other residues upon substitution with alanine resulted in near WT activity, although several residues adjoining Leu-678 displayed a slight reduction in activity. The expression levels of each of the mutants were examined and found to be similar, indicating that the low activity of the L678A mutant was not the result of low levels of expression (Fig. 3 B). The ability of the WT and L678A mutant hAhR to enhance DRE-driven reporter activity was further assessed in triplicate, and the L678A mutant exhibited a very low level of transcriptional activity compared with WT hAhR (Fig. 4).Figure 4DRE-driven reporter gene activity of the L678A mutant compared with the WT hAhR. COS-1 cells were transfected in 6-well plates with a total of 1.6 μg of DNA which included 50 ng of hAhR FL/hAhR deletion plasmid or empty vector (indicated as control), 50 ng of DRE-driven luciferase gene plasmid, pGUDLUC 6.1, and the β-galactosidase internal control plasmid, pDJM-βgal. The cells were harvested 10 h after treatment with TCDD or carrier solvent. Extracts were assayed for luciferase activity, which was subsequently normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as Relative Luciferase Units (RLU). The numbers on the right indicate %WT hAhR activity of each of the point mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The L678A mutant was tested in gel shift assays for ligand binding, heterodimerization, and DRE binding activity. The L678A mutant heterodimerized and bound DRE similar to wild-type hAhR, indicating that the low level of activity seen in reporter gene assays was not the result of disruption of ligand binding, heterodimerization, or DNA binding (Fig. 5). We also tested the hAhR L678A mutant for its ability to function as a dominant negative in an AhR-driven reporter gene assay with the hypothesis that the increasing expression of L678A mutant would function as a dominant negative in the presence of the wild-type hAhR by competing for the available ARNT pool and subsequent binding to DREs. Indeed, increasing amounts of hAhR/L678A mutant expression down-regulated WT hAhR activity in reporter gene assays, suggesting that the mutant AhR is capable of heterodimerizing with ARNT and thus competing for the ava"
https://openalex.org/W1995963733,"The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a pivotal role in endochondral bone formation. Using differential display polymerase chain reaction, we have identified a novel gene, named BIG-3 (BMP-2-induced gene 3kb), that is induced as a murine prechondroblastic cell line, MLB13MYC clone 17, acquires osteoblastic features in response to BMP-2 treatment. The 3-kilobase mRNA encodes a 34-kDa protein containing seven WD-40 repeats. Northern and Western analyses demonstrated that BIG-3 mRNA and protein were induced after 24 h of BMP-2 treatment. BIG-3 mRNA was expressed in conditionally immortalized murine bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and growth plate chondrocytes, as well as in primary calvarial osteoblasts. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that BIG-3 was expressed in the osteoblasts of calvariae isolated from mouse embryos. To identify a role for BIG-3 in osteoblast differentiation, MC3T3-E1 cells were stably transfected with the full-length coding region of BIG-3 (MC3T3E1-BIG-3) cloned downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter in pcDNA3.1. Pooled MC3T3E1-BIG-3 clones expressed alkaline phosphatase activity earlier and achieved a peak level of activity 10-fold higher than cells transfected with the empty vector (MC3T3E1-EV) at 14 days. Cyclic AMP production in response to parathyroid hormone was increased 10- and 14-fold at 7 and 14 days, respectively, in MC3T3E1-BIG-3 clones, relative to MC3T3E1-EV clones. This increase in cAMP production was associated with an increase in PTH binding. Expression of BIG-3 increased mRNA levels encoding Cbfa1, type I collagen, and osteocalcin and accelerated formation of mineralized nodules. In conclusion, we have identified a novel WD-40 protein, induced by BMP-2 treatment, that dramatically accelerates the program of osteoblastic differentiation in stably transfected MC3T3E1 cells.

Although endochondral bone formation in vivo and in vitro has been the focus of several studies, the molecular signals that control this process remain to be defined. A number of factors have been shown to play a critical role in endochondral bone formation including transforming growth factor-β superfamily members, notably the subfamily of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)1 (1Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar, 2Celeste A.J. Iannazzi J.A. Taylor R.C. Hewick R.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9843-9847Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). BMPs have high homology to decapentaplegic (dpp) and to Vg-1, which are responsible for early embryo pattern formation in Drosophilaand Xenopus, respectively (1Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar). BMPs are expressed in a spatial and temporal pattern during embryogenesis in vertebrates and are required for the development of many organs and tissues, including the lung, kidney, eye, testis, teeth, skin, and heart (3Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). They are also expressed at sites of new bone formation early in development, suggesting that they are key signaling molecules for limb formation and patterning as well as for osteogenesis (3Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 4Wozney J.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 32: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 5Wang E.A. Rosen V.

BMPs were originally identified as bone-derived factors capable of inducing ectopic bone formation when injected subcutaneously in animal models (6Urist M.R.

Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Using differential display PCR, we have identified a novel gene 3 kb long, named BIG-3 (BMP-2-inducedgene 3 kb), which is induced as a prechondroblastic cell line, MLB13MYC clone 17 (15), and acquires markers of the osteoblast phenotype in response to BMP-2 treatment. When treated with BMP-2, these cells rapidly lose chondrocytic markers and express osteoblastic markers including type I collagen and osteocalcin mRNA (15Rosen V. Nove J. Song J.J. Thies S. Cox K. Wozney J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because the BMP-2-induced expression of osteoblastic markers by MLB13MYC clone 17 cells parallels molecular events seen during endochondral bone formation in vivo, these cells are a suitable model for identifying genes regulated by BMP-2 during endochondral bone formation. BIG-3 encodes a novel 34-kDa protein belonging to the family of WD-40 repeat proteins. This family of proteins has been shown to play a role in numerous cellular functions including signal transduction, mRNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, and regulation of the cell cycle (16Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 17Smith T.J. Gaitatzesm C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem.

A. 2000; 97: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Structurally, these proteins contain a conserved Trp-Asp motif (the so-called WD-40 repeat), which contains the GH dipeptide at the N terminus and the WD dipeptide at the C terminus separated by a region of variable length (16Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 17Smith T.J. Gaitatzesm C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The best characterized WD repeat protein is the β-subunit of the G proteins, which contains seven WD-40 repeats (19Neer E.J. Smith T.F.

Similar repetitive motifs have been found in a number of other proteins with apparently unrelated cellular functions such as a mammalian coatamer β-subunit, a component of a cytosolic protein complex that associates with Golgi membranes (21Stenbeck G.

However, none of the members of the WD-40 family of proteins has been shown to play a role in the regulation of endochondral bone formation. Because BIG-3 was regulated by BMP-2 and was expressed in cells of the osteoblastic lineage in vitro, we undertook studies to identify a functional role for BIG-3 in the program of osteoblast differentiation. The murine cell line, MC3T3-E1, was chosen for these studies because it has features of preosteoblasts and is thought to recapitulate the program of osteoblast differentiation when cultured for prolonged periods in the absence of differentiating agents such as BMP-2. The prechondroblastic cell line MLB13MYC clone 17 was maintained as reported previously (15Rosen V. Nove J. Song J.J. Thies S. Cox K. Wozney J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). At confluence, the cells were treated with 0, 200, and 500 ng/ml BMP-2 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% heat-inactivated-fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 8–72 h. All cells were harvested 72 h after confluence. Conditionally immortalized murine bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and growth plate chondrocytes (Dr. F. R. Bringhurst, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) were cultured as reported previously (31Liu B.Y. Guo J. Lanske B. Divieti P. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1952-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Divieti P. Lanske B. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. J. Bone Min.

Total RNA was isolated from cells cultured for 5 days under differentiating conditions. Primary calvarial osteoblasts from 18.5 dpc embryos were isolated and cultured as described previously (32Divieti P. Lanske B. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. J. Bone Min. Res. 1998; 13: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MC3T3E1 cells, obtained from ATCC, were cultured in α-minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for periods ranging from 3 to 35 days. In experiments assessing mineralization, medium was supplemented with β-glycerol phosphate and ascorbic acid (34Quarles L.D. Wenstrup R.J. Castillo S.A. Drezner M.K. Endocrinolgy. 1991; 128: 3144-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Sigma). Fresh medium was added twice a week. Total RNA, isolated from MLB13MYC clone 17 cells (Tri reagent, Sigma) treated with BMP-2 (200 and 500 ng/ml) for 8, 16, or 24 h, was first treated with RNase-free DNase I to eliminate contaminating chromosomal DNA (MessageClean® kit, GenHunter Corp, Nashville, TN). Total RNA isolated from parallel untreated cultures was used as control for each time point. Two independent ddPCR reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (RNAimage®kit, GenHunter Corp, Nashville, TN). The radioactive PCR products were resolved on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide/urea sequencing gels. After overnight autoradiography, differentially expressed bands were identified by comparison of ddPCR products representing cDNA species from BMP-2 treated and untreated cells. ddPCR products that were reproducibly differentially expressed were excised from the gel, reamplified, and subcloned into PGEM-T easy (Promega, Norwalk, CT). Ten μg of total RNA (or two μg of poly(A)+ mRNA for osteocalcin detection) was isolated from the cell types indicated and from tissues of a 3-month-old male C57BL6 mouse, was resolved on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Biotrans ICN, Aurora, OH) by capillary blotting. Probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to a specific activity of ≥108 cpm/ng DNA (Megaprime™ DNA labeling systems,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were exposed for equivalent lengths of time to permit assessment of the relative level of expression of BIG-3 in the cell lines and tissues examined. Control hybridization with an 18 S rRNA antisense oligonucleotide or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase verified that equal amounts of RNA were loaded. To obtain the full-length cDNA sequence of BIG-3, a cDNA library engineered using mRNA isolated from BMP-2-treated MLB13MYC clone 17 cells was screened. Screening of 1 × 106 plaque-forming units resulted in the isolation of three independent clones. The cDNA inserts and pBluescript were excised from the λ phage using Ex Assist helper phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The full-length sequence was obtained by sequencing both strands of the three clones. A peptide, LENDKTIKLWKSDC, selected as an epitope using the Jameson-Wolf antigenicity index, was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Massachusetts General Hospital, Peptide Core Facility) and used to immunize rabbits (Covance, Denver, PA). Following affinity purification of serum on a peptide column, the purified anti-BIG-3 was used for immunohistochemistry. Calvariae from 14.5 to 18.5 dpc embryos were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, followed by dehydration and paraffin embedding. Tissue blocks were cut into 6-μm sections, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. After incubation with 3% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidase activity, immunohistochemistry was performed using the TSA Biotin system kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, slides were incubated with anti-BIG-3 or with a nonimmune rabbit IgG at room temperature for 1 h, followed by rinses and addition of a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature, slides were treated with biotinyl tyramide for 5 min. Immunoreactive proteins were then visualized using streptavidin-fluorescein and streptavidin-Texas Red. MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 103 cells/cm2. After 24 h they were stably transfected with the full-length coding region of BIG-3 (MC3T3E1-BIG-3) cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or with the empty vector (MC3T3E1-EV) using calcium phosphate precipitation. After 24 h, and every 48 h thereafter, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 300 μg/ml of G418 for 14 days. This G418 dose was demonstrated to kill 100% of untransfected cells in 10 days. Three independent pools of 8–12 clones of MC3T3E1-BIG3 and MC3T3E1-EV were isolated. Pools of clones between passages 2 and 5 were used for the experiments reported. MC3T3E1-EV and MC3T3E1-BIG-3 pooled clones were plated at a density of 5 × 103cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 2 to 7 days. At each time point, cells were harvested and counted using a hemocytometer. Duplicate measurements were performed on four independent wells for each time point. MC3T3E1-EV and MC3T3E1-BIG-3 pooled clones were plated at a density of 5 × 103cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 3 to 25 days. At each time point, the alkaline phosphatase activity in cell lysates was assessed in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 1.5 m2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol for 1 h at 37 °C usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. The release ofp-nitrophenol was monitored by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. MC3T3E1-EV and MC3T3E1-BIG-3 pooled clones were plated at a density of 5 × 103cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 5 to 25 days. To assess basal and agonist-induced cyclic AMP accumulation, cells were rinsed twice with assay buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of agonist. After removal of the buffer, the plates were immediately frozen on dry ice. The frozen cells were thawed directly into 0.25 ml of 50 mm HCl and cAMP in the acid extracts was measured using a cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (35Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Wilson A.K. Keutmann H.T. Nussbaum S.R. Potts Jr, J.T. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6584-6588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). MC3T3E1-EV and MC3T3E1-BIG-3 pooled clones were plated at a density of 50 × 103cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 7 to 21 days. Measurement of PTH 1 receptor-specific binding was performed as described previously (36Bringhurst F.R. Juppner H. Guo J. Urena P. Potts Jr, J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G., V. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cell monolayers in 24-well dishes were washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer before incubation with 125I-labeled rat [Nle8,18,Tyr34]PTH-(1–34)amide (100,000–200,000 cpm/well) for 4 h at 15 C. Cells were then washed with ice-cold binding buffer, before assessment of cell-associated radioactivity. Receptor number was determined by Scatchard analysis, using human [Tyr34]PTH-(1–34)NH2 as a competing ligand. MLB13MYC clone 17 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 and treated with 0 or 200 ng/ml BMP-2 for 24 h. Pooled MC3T3E1-EV and MC3T3E1-BIG-3 clones were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 3 to 30 days. Cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, and 10 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. After transfer to Hybond ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Immunodetection was performed by incubating with anti-BIG-3 at room temperature for 1 h, followed by rinses and addition of a peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MC3T3E1-EV and MC3T3E1-BIG-3 pooled clones were plated at a density of 5 × 10 3cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 14 to 35 days. The formation of mineralized matrix nodules was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining (14Gori F. Thomas T. Hicok K.C. Spelberg T.C. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For quantitative assessment, the Alizarin Red S dye was eluted and measured spectrophotometrically (14Gori F. Thomas T. Hicok K.C. Spelberg T.C. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Multiple measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences between the values obtained from MC3T3E1-BIG-3 cells and their respective controls. Student's paired ttest was used to evaluate differences between MC3T3E1-BIG-3 pools and MC3T3E1-EV pools at each time point. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Total RNA, isolated from MLB13MYC clone 17 cells treated with 0, 200, or 500 ng/ml BMP-2 for 8, 16, and 24 h, was used for ddPCR experiments. After overnight autoradiography, bands representing differentially expressed mRNAs were identified. One of the differentially expressed PCR products (Fig.1 A, arrow) was excised, reamplified, and used as a probe in Northern analyses to confirm differential expression (data not shown). The ddPCR product was then subcloned into pGEM T-easy. Northern blots, probed with this subcloned cDNA, detected a single mRNA transcript of 3 kb (Fig.1 B), which was induced 3.5-fold after 24 h of BMP-2 treatment of MLB13MYC clone 17 cells, relative to cells left untreated. The sequence of this ddPCR product did not correspond to any known genes in the NCBI BLAST data base. We named this cDNA BIG-3 (forBMP-2-induced gene 3kb). Because MLB13MYC clone 17 cells have features of prechondroblastic cells and, upon BMP-2 treatment, acquire features of osteoblasts (15Rosen V. Nove J. Song J.J. Thies S. Cox K. Wozney J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether selected chondrocyte and osteoblast cell lines express BIG-3. The BIG-3 transcript was detected in RNA isolated from conditionally immortalized murine bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes isolated from 18.5 dpc embryos (all cultured under differentiating conditions), as well as in RNA isolated from calvaria and primary calvarial osteoblasts from 18.5 dpc embryos (Fig. 2 A). BIG-3 expression was also detected in differentiated conditionally immortalized murine growth plate chondrocytes, and 96 h of BMP-2 treatment (100 ng/ml) increased BIG-3 mRNA levels by 4-fold in these cells, relative to cells left untreated for 96 h (Fig. 2 B). BIG-3 mRNA was also present in ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells but was not detected in murine fibroblasts (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 C, BIG-3 mRNA was present in several mouse tissues, with testis exhibiting the highest levels.Figure 2Northern analysis. Total RNA, isolated from cells of the osteoblast and chondroblast lineage and from tissues isolated from 3-month-old C57BL/6 mouse, was hybridized with an α-32P-labeled cDNA probe for BIG-3.

The screening of 1 × 106 plaque-forming units resulted in the isolation of three independent overlapping phage clones. GenBank™ data base analysis of the full-length sequence (2921 base pairs; accession no. AF416510) (Fig. 3 A) revealed that BIG-3 did not encode a gene with a known function. This sequence was highly homologous (>87%) to several partial human cDNAs of unknown function (BC001635, AHS011376, AK025810, and AK000552). The deduced 328-amino acid sequence (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) (Fig.3 A) had a calculated molecular mass of ∼34 kDa composed largely of WD-40 repeats (ExPASY). Molecular modeling (Rasmol) confirmed a propeller structure, for these seven repeats, characteristic of the family of WD repeat proteins (Fig.3 B). Because BIG-3 was expressed in vitro by cells of the osteoblastic lineage, we performed immunohistochemistry to determine whether osteoblasts express BIG-3 in vivo. BIG-3 protein was present in osteoblasts of fetal mouse calvariae from 14.5 to 18.5 dpc (Fig. 4, 15.5 dpc). Because BIG-3 was expressed in vitro and in vivoby cells of the osteoblastic lineage, we investigated whether this novel gene could alter the program of osteoblastic differentiation in the murine osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1. MC3T3-E1 cells were chosen because they have features of preosteoblasts and recapitulate the program of osteoblast differentiation when cultured for prolonged periods in the absence of exogenous differentiating agents such as BMP-2. These cells were, therefore, stably transfected with the full-length coding region of BIG-3 (MC3T3E1-BIG-3) or with the empty vector (MC3T3E1-EV) and selected markers of osteoblastic differentiation were assessed. The acquisition of the mature osteoblast phenotype is characterized by the ability of these cells to synthesize alkaline phosphatase, and an increase in the specific activity of this enzyme is directly correlated with a shift to a more differentiated state (37Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocrine Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Therefore, three independent pools of 8–12 clones of both MC3T3E1-BIG-3 and MC3T3E1-EV were examined for the time course of onset, and magnitude of increase, in alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity. In the MC3T3E1-EV pools, AP activity did not increase significantly until 11 days (p < 0.0005 by Student's t test). However, a significant increase was seen in all MC3T3E1-BIG-3 pools at 7 days (p < 0.005 by Student's t test), and, by 14 days, the cells transfected with BIG-3 had a 10-fold increase in AP activity relative to MC3T3E1-EV pools (p < 0.00001 by Student's t test) (Fig. 5). Although the alkaline phosphatase activity rose significantly in the MC3T3E1-EV pools over time, at 25 days the MC3T3E1-BIG-3 pools maintained a 4-fold higher activity (p < 0.00001 by Student's t test) (Fig. 5). No statistically significant differences were observed within the three pools of MC3T3E1-BIG-3 clones or the three MC3T3E1-EV pools. The receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH 1 receptor) has been shown to be induced during osteoblastic differentiation (38Bos M.P. van der Meer J.M. Feyen J.H. Herrmann-Erlee M.P. Calcif.

The PLC and PKC isoforms that are involved in LTD remain unclear, however. One previous study found no change in LTD in PKCγ-deficient mice, thus, in the present study, we examined cerebellar LTD in PLCβ4-deficient mice. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses of cerebellum from wild-type mice revealed that PLCβ1 was expressed weakly and uniformly, PLCβ2 was not detected, PLCβ3 was expressed predominantly in caudal cerebellum (lobes 7–10), and PLCβ4 was expressed uniformly throughout. In PLCβ4-deficient mice, expression of total PLCβ, the mGluR1-mediated Ca2+ response, and LTD induction were greatly reduced in rostral cerebellum (lobes 1–6). Furthermore, we used immunohistochemistry to localize PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ in mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells during LTD induction. Both PKCα and PKCβI were found to be translocated to the plasmamembrane under these conditions.

PLCβ3 is expressed predominantly in the caudal half of cerebellar Purkinje cells, whereas PLCβ4 is distributed throughout cerebellar Purkinje cells. Fly homologue of PLCβ4 has been implicated in transduction of visual information in Drosophila photoreceptors (14Yoshioka T. Inoue H. Kasama T. Seyama Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Hotta Y. J. Biochem.

Commun. 1993; 194: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), however, the role of PLCβ4 in the cerebellum remains unknown. The PLCβ4-deficient mice were viable but had a higher mortality rate than wild-type mice, and the body weight of PLCβ4-deficient mice was generally less than that of wild-type mice in the early stages of postnatal development, as reported previously (16Jiang H. Lyubarsky A. Dodd R. Vardi N. Pugh E. Baylor D. Simon M.I. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14598-14601Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Kim D. Jun K.S. Lee S.B. Kang N.G.

The body weight of the PLCβ4-deficient mice gradually increased to match wild-type mice 8 weeks after birth. Using a light microscope, no differences were detected in the size of whole cerebellum, lobe size, or Purkinje cell size between PLCβ4-deficient and wild-type mice. Anatomical alterations are minimal in mGluR1-deficient mutant mice (6Aiba A. Kano M. Chen C. Stanton M.E. Fox G.D. Herrup K. Zwingman T.A. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 79: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and cerebellar architecture is also normal in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-deficient mutant mice (18Shibuki K.

Eight PKC isozymes (α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ε, ζ, and η) are expressed in the cerebellum, of which six (α, βI, γ, δ, ε, and ζ) are found in cerebellar Purkinje cells (23Wetsel W.C. Khan W.A.

Selective expression of a pseudosubstrate PKC inhibitor, PKC inhibitor peptide (Arg19-Val31), in Purkinje cells completely blocked cerebellar LTD (26De Zeeuw C.I. Hansel C. Bian F. Koekkoek S.K. van Alphen A.M. Linden D.J. Oberdick J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore, using PLCβ4-deficient mice in the present study, we examined the effects of disruption of PLCβ4 on cerebellar LTD and determined which PKC isozymes were essential for the induction of LTD. Mice with a disruption of the PLCβ4 gene were generated in the laboratory of M. Katsuki according to standard methods (27Capecchi M.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). A genomic clone encoding the PLCβ4 catalytic region (denoted the Y region) was isolated to construct a targeting vector in which exons that encode amino acid residues 539–646 were replaced with a neomycin-resistant gene cassette, and a diphtheria toxin fragment A gene was attached to the 3′-end of the targeting vector for negative selection. Embryonic stem cells were transfected with the targeting vector by electroporation and selected with G418 (250 μg/ml) for 8 days. G418-resistant colonies were isolated, and the targeted clones were selected using genomic Southern blot analysis with a probe as illustrated in Fig.1 A. Chimeric mice were generated from frozen C57BL/6J blastocytes injected with the embryonic stem cells after warming (28Nakao K. Nakagata N. Katsuki M. Exp. Anim. (Tokyo). 1998; 47: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Male chimeric mice were mated with C57BL/6J female mice. The tail DNA of offspring was analyzed using Southern blot analysis (Fig.1 B) to identify the genotype or amplified using polymerase chain reaction. PLC enzymatic activity was quantified in 200 μl of assay mixture containing 150 μmPIP2. The mixture contained 20,000 cpm [3H]PIP2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C and centrifuged (10,000 ×g for 30 min) to precipitate the cerebellar homogenate, and the reaction was terminated as previously described (29Min D.S. Kim D.M. Lee Y.H. Seo J. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12207-12212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each lobe of the vermis of the cerebellum from wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice was homogenized, and 3 μg of protein was separated using 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-PLCβ1, -β2, -β3, or -β4 antibodies (1/1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then with an alkaline-phosphatase-labeled secondary antibody (1/5000 dilution, Promega, Madison, WI). Immunoreacted bands were visualized using ProtoBlot Western blot AP Systems (Promega). At the third or fourth postnatal week, mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (4 mg/100 g) and transcardially perfused with 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (4 °C, pH 7.4). The brains were immersed in the same fixative for half a day and then embedded in paraffin. Sagittal or coronal paraffin-embedded sections (3–5 μm thick) were prepared for immunohistochemical visualization using a streptavidin-peroxidase reaction (Nichirei Co. Ltd., Japan (30Guesdon J.L. Ternynck T. Avrameas S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1979; 27: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 31Warnke R. Levy R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar)). As a blocking step, the sections were incubated with 3% H2O2 in distilled water for 10 min and then 10% normal goat serum for 1 h. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies against either mouse PLCβ3 (1/500), PLCβ4 (1/50), PKCα (1/100, Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD), PKCβI (1/500, Life Technologies, Inc.), PKCβII (1/500, Life Technologies, Inc.), or PKCγ (1/500, Life Technologies, Inc.) were applied to brain sections overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, sections were incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G for 1 h at room temperature (23–26 °C). Sections were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h at room temperature. Between each incubation step, the sections were rinsed twice in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 5 min each. The final peroxidase reaction was performed using 0.05% diaminobenzidine and 0.005% H2O2. The same sections were stained with cresyl violet for Nissl staining. For immunohistochemical analysis of PKC isozymes, a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was used and the immunostained sections were examined using fluorescence microscopy. Sagittal slices (180–200 μm thick) of cerebellar vermis were prepared from 3- to 5-week-old wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice using a microslicer (DTK-1000, Dosaka, Japan) and maintained at room temperature in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), which consisted of 138.6 mmNaCl, 3.35 mm KCl, 21 mm NaHCO3, 0.6 mm NaH2PO4, 9.9 mmglucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2 and was gassed with a mixture of 95% O2and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4). The Ca2+ indicator fura-2 (1 mm, Dojin, Japan) was injected into Purkinje cells for 25–45 min through patch pipettes or cerebellar slices were incubated in 10 μm fura-2 AM (Dojin) for 1 h with 0.001% Cremophore EL. The slices were then maintained in ACSF for at least 30 min and transferred to the stage of an Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Fluorescence Ca2+ ratio imaging was carried out by excitation of the indicator at 340:380 nm, and paired emission images were acquired using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (C4880, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) at 510 nm. Fluorescence images were acquired using a 60× water immersion objective (LUMPlanFI, numerical aperture (NA) 0.90, Olympus, Japan) that efficiently passed 340-nm light, and ratios were determined using a digital image acquisition system and image-processing software (ARGUS 50/CA, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from visually identified Purkinje cells under Nomarski optics using a 40× water immersion objective (NA 0.75, Zeiss). Patch pipettes (3–4 MΩ) were filled with intracellular solution containing 150 mm KCH3SO3, 5 mm KCl, 0.3 mm K-EGTA, 5.0 mm sodium HEPES, 3.0 mm Mg-ATP, and 0.4 mm Na-GTP (pH 7.4). Membrane currents were recorded using an EPC-7 amplifier (List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany) and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), digitized, and stored on a computer disc for off-line analysis. PF-mediated ionotropic-glutamate-receptor-type excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were identified based on response properties following paired-pulse stimulation (duration, 50–100 μs; amplitude, 5–15 V) applied via a glass microelectrode with 2- to 3-μm tip diameter, filled with normal ACSF, and placed within the molecular layer in the cerebellar cortex. Paired-pulse stimulation was applied at 0.2 Hz. For measuring PF-evoked EPSCs, bicuculline (10 μm) was added to the ACSF to eliminate γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated postsynaptic currents. Series resistance (8–18 MΩ) was monitored using a −5-mV hyperpolarizing voltage step after PF stimulation. The series resistance compensation control of the amplitude was set between 60 and 70%. mGluR1-mediated EPSCs were obtained using repetitive, high frequency stimulation (10 pulses at 100 Hz; duration, 180 μs; amplitude, 30 V). To prevent ionotropic glutamate and GABAAreceptor responses, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 μm), d(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (30 μm), and bicuculline (50 μm) were added to the external solution. All physiological experiments were performed at room temperature. The experimental protocols for LTD were performed as described previously with slight modification (32Nakazawa K. Mikawa S. Hashikawa T. Ito M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 697-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Murashima M. Hirano T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7326-7333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sagittal slices (400 μm thick) of cerebellar vermis were prepared from 3- to 5-week-old wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice using a microslicer and maintained at room temperature in ACSF, including 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin and 1 μm BAPTA-AM, and saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2. To stimulate the cells, each slice was then transferred to a cylinder chamber (φ 35 mm) in medium containing 50 mm KCl and 100 μm glutamate. Five minutes after stimulation, the slices were washed with ACSF for 5 min, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described under “Western Blot Analysis and Immunohistochemistry.” Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, and statistical significance was determined using a Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test. Differences were considered significant when P was less than 0.05. During the course of the present study, the care of the animals conformed to the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Investigation Committee at the University of Tokyo. The total activity of membrane-associated PLC was examined using [3H]PIP2 as a substrate in cerebellar slices from wild-type (n = 4) and PLCβ4-deficient mice (n = 5). As shown in Fig.1 C, the total PLC activity in PLCβ4-deficient mice was less than 30% of control values in rostral cerebellum and less than 40% in caudal cerebellum. These data suggest that PLCβ4 activity in rostral and caudal cerebellum was 70 and 60% of the total PLC activity, respectively. Total PLC activity was found to be 5.6 nmol/mg/min in rostral cerebellum and 4.5 nmol/mg/min in caudal cerebellum. Western blot analysis (Fig.2 A) indicates that PLCβ1, PLCβ3, and PLCβ4 were expressed in wild-type mouse cerebellum. PLCβ4 protein was not detected in the cerebellum from PLCβ4-deficient mice (Fig. 2 A), whereas the expression levels of the other PLCβ isoforms (PLCβ1, PLCβ2, and PLCβ3) were not altered. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using an anti-PLCβ4 antibody (Fig. 2, B and C). Each of the lobes in the cerebellar slices was numbered from 1 to 10 as shown in Fig.2 C. PLCβ4 was expressed uniformly in Purkinje cells in rostral (lobes 1–6) and caudal (lobes 7–10) cerebellum from wild-type mice (Fig. 2 C), whereas PLCβ3 is more abundant in Purkinje cells in caudal cerebellum from wild-type mice (13, 19; Fig. 2, D–F). No morphological changes were observed in the cerebellum of PLCβ4-deficient mice when examined using light microscopy (data not shown). To examine PF-Purkinje cell synaptic function in PLCβ4-deficient mice, we measured the rise and decay time constants of EPSCs, which were calculated using a single-exponential fit (34Llano I. Marty A. Armstrong C.M. Konnerth A. J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 183-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and paired-pulse facilitation in acute cerebellar slices. The mean rise time constant was 1.23 ± 0.06 ms (n = 30) and 1.21 ± 0.05 ms (n = 35) in Purkinje cells from wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice, respectively. The mean decay time constant was 14.1 ± 0.5 ms (n = 30) in wild-typeversus 12.8 ± 0.5 ms (n = 35) in PLCβ4-deficient Purkinje cells. There was no significant difference in either the rise or decay time constants between wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice (p > 0.05; Fig.3, A and B). The PF responses exhibited paired-pulse facilitation (35Konnerth A. Llano I. Armstrong C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2662-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), which decreased with increasing interpulse intervals in a similar manner in wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, short term plasticity in PF-Purkinje cell synapses appeared normal in PLCβ4-deficient mice. Furthermore, no significant difference was found in the resting membrane potentials (−55.5 ± 1.3 mVversus −56.3 ± 1.5 mV) of Purkinje cells from wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice. LTD of synaptic transmission at PF-Purkinje cell synapses is induced by simultaneous low frequency activation of PF and climbing fibers (1Ito M. Sakurai M. Tongroach P. J.

Climbing fiber stimulation can be replaced by depolarizing Purkinje cells to allow calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (36Crepel F. Krupa M. Brain Res. 1988; 458: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 37Hirano T. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 119: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We recorded PF-EPSCs from Purkinje cells in cerebellar lobes from wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice using whole-cell patch clamp and a conjunctive stimulation protocol (CJ) composed of 300 PF stimuli in conjunction with a depolarizing pulse (200 ms, −60 to +20 mV) repeated at 1 Hz. In 21 of 25 Purkinje cells from wild-type mice (lobes 1–10), CJ stimulation depressed the amplitude of PF-EPSCs, and this depression persisted over 30 min after the onset of the stimulation (Fig.4 A). The mean PF-EPSCs amplitude, measured 25–30 min after CJ stimulation, was reduced to 75.8% ± 3.6% (n = 17 from 13 mice, two cells studied blind) of the original baseline EPSC amplitude. Depression could be induced even after 40 min in whole-cell recording configuration, indicating that cell dialysis had no significant effect on LTD induction. In PLCβ4-deficient mice, Purkinje cells exhibited reduced LTD after CJ stimulation in rostral cerebellum (lobes 1–6; Fig. 4 B), whereas LTD was intact in caudal cerebellum (lobes 7–10; Fig. 4 C). The mean amplitude of PF-EPSCs in rostral cerebellum recorded 25–30 min after CJ stimulation was 90.1% ± 5.5% of control (n = 16 from 11 mice, two cells studied blind). The difference between the wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice was significant (Mann-Whitney U test,p < 0.05) in rostral cerebellum, whereas LTD from caudal cerebellum in PLCβ4-deficient mice (67.5% ± 2.5%;n = 11 from 10 mice) was comparable to LTD in wild-type mice (Mann-Whitney U test, p > 0.05). PKC isozymes in Purkinje cells from PLCβ4-deficient mice were examined as a function of mGluR1-mediated IP3-dependent Ca2+ mobilization. Only classic PKC isozymes (α, βI, βII, and γ) can be activated by IP3-activated Ca2+ release and diacylglycerol (38Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Although application of the mGluR1-specific agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) has been shown to increase [Ca2+]i in rodent cerebellar Purkinje cells (39; Fig. 5 K), in the present study in PLCβ4-deficient mice, DHPG did not induce Ca2+ mobilization (n = 3; Fig. 5,C and E) in lobe 6 Purkinje cells but increased dendritic [Ca2+]i to a small degree inlobe 9 Purkinje cells (n = 4; Fig. 5,H and J). To exclude the possibility that the lack of Ca2+ release in the mutant mice was an artifact of slice preparation, we examined AMPAR-induced Ca2+ release after DHPG stimulation. Application of AMPA evoked a large Ca2+ transient in Purkinje cells in wild-type cerebellum (Fig. 5 K). As shown in Fig. 5 (E andJ), large Ca2+ responses were also obtained in Purkinje cells in rostral and caudal cerebellum from PLCβ4-deficient mice following application of AMPA. There was an additional slow phase of the AMPA-induced Ca2+ response in the dendrite (Fig. 5,E, J, and K), which may be due to Ca2+ signals traveling from distal parts of the dendrite. In the soma, however, the two phases overlapped. These results suggest that classic PKC isozymes were not activated in rostral cerebellum from PLCβ4-deficient mice. To investigate possible colocalization of classic PKC isozymes with PLCβ4, we examined the distribution of classic PKC isozymes using antibodies against each isozyme. Immunostaining with antibodies were done as described under “Experimental Procedure.” As shown in Fig.6 (A–D), PKCα, βI, and γ were expressed uniformly in Purkinje cells, whereas PKCβII was not detected. These data are consistent with data obtained previously by several authors (23Wetsel W.C. Khan W.A. Merchenthaler I. Rivera H. Halpern A.E. Phung H.M. Negro-Vilar A. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 25Garcia M.M. Harlan R.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 385: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To investigate the PKC isozymes coupled to PLCβ4 and PLCβ3, we examined the translocation of PKC isozymes during LTD induction using immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies were used in this experiment, because fluorescent images showed a relatively large difference between wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice with high contrast. 400-μm cerebellar slices from wild-type (n = 8 from four mice) and PLCβ4-deficient mice (n = 8 from four mice) were incubated for 5 min in ACSF with (n = 4 of each mice) or without (n = 4 of each mice) 100 μmglutamate and 50 mm KCl. After stimulation, samples were rinsed for 5 min, followed by fixation. From 10 to 15 sections (5-μm thickness) from each slice were stained with antibodies. In wild-type mice, there was strong staining for PKCα in the dendrites of Purkinje cells (Fig. 6 F), indicating that PKCα is translocated. In contrast, no stain was detected in dendrites in PLCβ4-deficient mice (Fig. 6 G). PKCβI immunoreactivity was very strong in Purkinje cell dendrites and soma in all lobes of wild-type mice (Fig.6 I), whereas the fluorescent signal was observed only in cell somas in rostral part of PLCβ4-deficient mice (Fig.6 J). No difference in staining for PKCγ, however, was detectable between wild-type and PLCβ4-deficient mice (Fig. 6,L and M). Unfortunately, we could not determine the coupling selectivity between PLC (β3 and β4) and PKC (α and βI), because imaging of PKC in caudal part is not clear (data not shown). To overcome this difficulty, a real time imaging of GFP-labeled PKC in living cells under LTD condition is desirable, but it is impossible at present stage. Therefore, we concluded that, at the lowest estimate, both PKCα and PKCβI were translocated during LTD induction, but PKCγ was not. In the present study, the mGluR1-mediated Ca2+response and LTD induction was greatly reduced in the rostral cerebellum from PLCβ4-deficient mice, an area in which PLCβ1 and PLCβ3 were also not expressed strongly in these mutant mice. In the caudal cerebellum, however, the residual PLCβ3 activity was sufficient to generate Ca2+ elevation and LTD induction. These results suggest that there was a minimum level of PLCβ3 and PLCβ4 required to generate the mGluR1-mediated Ca2+response and LTD. We also showed that LTD induction in rostral and caudal cerebellum required activation of classic PKC isozymes. We used immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses to localize the PLCβ isoforms in the wild-type mouse cerebellum: PLCβ1 was expressed uniformly and weakly, PLCβ2 was not detected, PLCβ3 was expressed predominantly in caudal cerebellar Purkinje cells (lobes 7–10), and PLCβ4 was expressed uniformly and strongly throughout cerebellar Purkinje cells. These results are consistent with previous reports of expression of the corresponding PLCβ isoform mRNA (11Tanaka O. Kondo H. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 182: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Roustan P. Abitbol M. Menini C. Ribeaudeau F. Gerard M. Vekemans M. Mallet J. Dufier J.L.

Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2016-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In PLCβ4-deficient mice, Although PLCβ1 was expressed in rostral cerebellar Purkinje cells, Purkinje cells in rostral cerebellum from PLCβ4-deficient mice lacked the mGluR1-mediated Ca2+ response. These results indicate that (i) PLCβ1 is not involved in the mGluR1-mediated signaling pathway in cerebellar Purkinje cells and does not have a role in the induction of cerebellar LTD and (ii) mGluR1-mediated responses in caudal cerebellar Purkinje cells from PLCβ4-deficient mice were produced by activation of PLCβ3 alone. These results suggest that PLCβ4 is a link between the activation of mGluR1 and the induction of LTD in rostral cerebellar Purkinje cells. The results of the present study showing that LTD induction was greatly reduced in PLCβ4-deficient mice is consistent with the lack of LTD in cerebellum from mGluR1-deficient mice (6Aiba A. Kano M.

Ferraguti F. Bordi F. Franz-Bacon K. Reggiani A. Matarese V. Conde F. Nature. 1994; 372: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) but does not appear to be consistent with the intact LTD induction observed in PKCγ-deficient mice (8Chen C. Kano M. Abeliovich A. Chen L. Bao S. Kim J.J. Hashimoto K. Thompson R.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1995; 83: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) if PLCβ4 activates PKCγ. Recent evidence using the expression of a PKC inhibitor in Purkinje cells indicates that PKC is required for LTD induction (26De Zeeuw C.I. Hansel C. Bian F. Koekkoek S.K. van Alphen A.M. Linden D.J. Oberdick J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PKCα, βI, and γ were expressed strongly and uniformly in cerebellar Purkinje cells, whereas PKCβII was not expressed in Purkinje cells as shown in Fig. 6(A–D) (25Garcia M.M. Harlan R.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 385: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PKCδ, ε, and ζ were also expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells (23Wetsel W.C. Khan W.A. Merchenthaler I. Rivera H. Halpern A.E. Phung H.M. Negro-Vilar A. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar); however, these isozymes are Ca2+-independent (for review, see Ref. 38Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar), thus, the contribution of these isozymes to LTD induction is likely to be small. Therefore, the remaining isozymes, PKCα and/or PKCβI, may compensate for the lack of PKCγ in rostral cerebellum of PKCγ-deficient mice. In PLCβ4-deficient mice, there did not appear to be any compensation for the lack of PLCβ4 by PLCβ1 in the rostral cerebellum. Thus, evidence suggests that, although compensation for deletion of protein isoforms in the signaling pathway downstream of PLCβ occurs, there is no compensatory mechanism for the deletion of PLCβ4 itself. Translocation of PKC isozymes after 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulation has been clearly observed in several cell systems (40Staak S. Behnisch T. Angenstein F. Brain Res. 1995; 682: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 41Sena C.M. Rosario L.M. Parker P.J. Patel V. Boarder M.R. J.

Brain Res. 1999; 64: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but not with stimulation sufficient for LTD induction. As described above, the combination of PLC (β3 and β4) activation and translocation of PKC (α and βI) is very likely. Translocation of PKCγ has been observed after stimulation used to induce long term potentiation in neurons in the CA1 region of hippocampus (45Van der Zee E.A. Luiten P.G. Disterhoft J.F. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1997; 21: 531-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 46Angenstein F. Riedel G. Reyman K.G. Staak S. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and TPA stimulation in COS-7 cells (43Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) but not by LTD-forming conditions in Purkinje cells in the present study. This is consistent with previous results from PKCγ-deficient mice (8Chen C. Kano M. Abeliovich A. Chen L. Bao S. Kim J.J. Hashimoto K. Thompson R.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1995; 83: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This result further indicates that PKCγ was not activated by the signaling pathway through PLCβ3 and PLCβ4 in cerebellar Purkinje cells. It has been reported that Purkinje cells in rostral cerebellum from PLCβ4-deficient mice form persistent multiple synapses with climbing fibers (19Kano M. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Kurihara H. Offermanns S. Jiang H. Wu Y. Jun K. Shin H.S. Inoue Y. Simon M.I. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15724-15729Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This difference may underlie the lack of LTD induction in PLCβ4-deficient mice, however, Chen et al. (8Chen C. Kano M. Abeliovich A. Chen L. Bao S. Kim J.J. Hashimoto K. Thompson R.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1995; 83: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) report that, in PKCγ-deficient mice also, each climbing fiber forms multiple synapses with Purkinje cells and generates multiple spikes that resemble complex spikes, and these mice do exhibit LTD. Thus, the persistent multiple innervation of Purkinje cells by climbing fibers in rostral cerebellum of PLCβ4-deficient mice does not appear to be involved in LTD induction. Moreover, eye blink conditioning is impaired in PLCβ4-deficient mice (47Kishimoto, Y., Hirono, M., Sugiyama, T., Kawahara, S., Nakao, K., Kishio, M., Katsuki, M., Yoshioka, T., and Kirino, Y. (2001)Neuroreport, in press.Google Scholar). The results from the present study support the idea that induction of LTD has a role in eye blink conditioning, but the developmental shift from multiple to mono-innervation of Purkinje cells by climbing fibers does not have a role in either LTD induction or eye blink conditioning. These ideas are expressed in Fig. 7 as a molecular linkage of mGluR1-Gq-PLCβ4-PKCα and/or PKCβI. Taken together, the results obtained in the present study provide strong support for the idea that cerebellar LTD involves PKC activation. Further studies are needed to determine if the signaling pathway involves more specific combinations between signaling molecules, such as mGluR1-Gq-PLCβ4-PKCα or mGluR1-Gq-PLCβ3-PKCβI. We thank S.

A profound increase in the size and number of peroxisomes occurs in livers of rats and mice exposed to a broad spectrum of structurally diverse compounds of industrial, pharmaceutical, and agricultural importance designated as peroxisome proliferators (2Reddy J.K.

These include certain phthalate ester plasticizers, herbicides, leukotriene D4 receptor antagonists, and lipid-lowering drugs, such as clofibrate, ciprofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and Wy-14,643, among others (2Reddy J.K.

This refractoriness of human hepatocytes to the inductive effects of PPARα ligands, especially of peroxisome proliferation and induction of H2O2-generating peroxisomal β-oxidation system enzymes, is based primarily, if not exclusively, on data obtained with primary cultures of human hepatocytes and a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (21Elcombe C.R.

Many factors, such as low levels of PPARα expression, expression of a human PPARα splice variant that may negatively interfere with PPARα function, differences in protein sequence between human and mouse PPARα, relative amounts of the three PPAR isotypes in liver cells, competition for the heterodimerization partner RXR, differences in the PPRE of target genes, and possible differences in nuclear receptor coactivators, may indeed account for the purported refractoriness of human hepatocytes to peroxisome proliferation (2Reddy J.K.

The proposal that humans are resistant to induction of peroxisome proliferation and liver tumor development presupposes (i) that human liver cells in vivo are resistant to peroxisome proliferator-induced pleiotropic responses at the anticipated levels of exposure and (ii) that failure to observe a robust morphological phenomenon of peroxisome proliferative response signifies that changes in the expression patterns of other genes may not be relevant in the development of liver cancer. Widespread exposure to synthetic PPARα ligands, nevertheless, raises a potential concern of carcinogenic risk to humans because of the uncertainty regarding the full spectrum of PPARα-regulated genes in liver and their role in liver cancer development (30Cherkaoui-Malki M.

In this study, we examined the functional competency of human PPARα on the induction of PPARα target genes in PPARα−/− mouse liver to determine the role of the species origin of this receptor in peroxisome proliferator-induced immediate pleiotropic responses. Targeted disruption of PPARα abolishes the induction of peroxisome proliferation and PPARα target genes in mouse liver (10Moody D.E. Loury D.N. Hammock B.D. Toxicol. Appl.

We demonstrate that introduction of adenoviruses encoding human PPARα or mouse PPARα into PPARα−/− mice fully restores the induction of ligand-mediated responses in liver. These studies establish that human PPARα is functionally fully competent in inducing peroxisome proliferation within the context of mouse liver environment, and the human PPARα-mouse RXR chimeric heterodimer can transcriptionally activate mouse PPARα target genes that contain the PPRE. Wild type (C57BL/6J) mice and PPARα−/− mice (13Lee S.S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell.

PPARα−/− mice were maintained on powdered diet with or without Wy-14,643 (0.1% w/w), ciprofibrate (0.025% w/w), nafenopin (0.1% w/w), or di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (2% w/w) for 10–14 days prior to adenovirus injection and killed on days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 after injection as indicated. For dose response of Ad/hPPARα to Wy-14,643 the PPARα−/− mice were maintained on powdered diet with different doses of Wy14,643 (0% w/w, 0.0125% w/w, 0.025% w/w, 0.05% w/w, and 0.1% w/w, respectively) from 1 day prior to injection and were killed 4 days later. For cell proliferation analysis, mice were given bromodeoxyuridine (0.5 mg/ml) in drinking water for 3 or 5 days after adenovirus injection, and their livers were processed for immunohistochemistry (31Qi C.

Animal procedures used in this study were approved by the Institutional Review Board for Animal Research of the Northwestern University. Construction of recombinant adenovirus Ad/hPPARα was as follows. Human PPARα cDNA (32Sher T. Yi H.F. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) was cloned into pCMV expression cassette at the SalI site, and the entire cassette was cut out with ClaI and BamHI and cloned into the EcoRV and BglII sites of pShuttle vector (Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc.). The linearized shuttle vector and AdEasy vector (Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc.) were then co-transformed into Escherichia coli strain BJ5183. Positive recombinant plasmid Ad/hPPARα was selected (Fig. 1). The linearized Ad/hPPARα was then transfected with LipofectAMINE2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) into the packaging cell HEK293A. Virus was purified with CsCl banding and stored at −70 °C. The mouse PPARα (mPPARα) cDNA (33Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ongg E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc.

Adenoviral construct of Ad/LacZ was the generous gift of Dr W. El-Deiry (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia) and has been described previously (34Mitchell K.O. El-Deiry W.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 223-230PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were intravenously injected (tail vein) in a volume of 200 μl with 1 × 1011 virus particles of Ad/LacZ, Ad/hPPARα, or Ad/mPPARα. Mice injected with PBS served as controls. For dose response of Ad/hPPARα or Ad/mPPARα to Wy-14,643 the PPARα−/− mice were injected with 1 × 1011 virus particles of Ad/hPPARα or Ad/mPPARα as described above. Mice treated with 0.1% Wy14,643 and injected with PBS served as controls. Livers were separated and quickly fixed or frozen and used for the desired experiments. Total RNA was isolated from liver using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After glyoxylation, samples were electrophoresed on an 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and then hybridized at 42 °C in a 50% formamide hybridization solution using 32P-labeled cDNA probes as described previously (31Qi C.

The values from PBS-injected mice were assigned the number 1.0. β-Galactosidase activity was visualized by incubating liver sections in PBS containing 5 mm potassium ferricyanate, 2 mm MgCl2, and 120 volume of 20 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside in dimethylformamide at 37 °C. Tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin was embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. Sections (4-μm thick) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical localization of human PPARα (hPPARα), L-PBE, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and bromodeoxyuridine was performed as described previously (31Qi C. Zhu Y. Pan J. Yeldandi A.V.

For cytochemical localization of peroxisomal catalase, tissues were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4 °C and incubated in alkaline 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate as described previously (14Fan C.Y.

Semithin sections, without counterstain, were examined by light microscopy. Ultrathin sections for electron microscopy were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The availability of PPARα−/−mice enabled us to determine the immediate effects of transient expression of human PPARα on the induction of peroxisome proliferator-mediated pleiotropic responses in PPARα−/−mouse hepatocytes in vivo. Since PPARα−/− mice are nonresponsive to peroxisome proliferators, as they fail to manifest hepatic peroxisome proliferation and overexpression of genes regulated by PPARα (10Moody D.E. Loury D.N. Hammock B.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1985; 78: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Lee S.S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar), we used recombinant adenovirus to express human PPARα in PPARα−/− mouse liver and evaluated the immediate pleiotropic effects of PPARα agonists. As expected, PPARα−/− mice maintained on Wy-14,643-containing diet failed to show peroxisome proliferation and overexpression of PPARα target genes in liver as evidenced by observations in mice given PBS or Ad/LacZ intravenously. To assess the ability of adenovirally expressed recombinant human PPARα to support peroxisome proliferation in PPARα−/− mouse hepatocytes, we infected PPARα−/− mice maintained on a diet containing Wy-14,643 with 6.125 × 109–4 × 1011infectious viral particles by tail vein injection and determined the expression levels of L-PBE, the second enzyme of the inducible classical peroxisomal β-oxidation system (1Reddy J.K. Hashimoto T. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 193-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of liver samples obtained 4 days after infection revealed maximum induction with 1 × 1011 infectious viral particles (Fig. 2 A). At the higher viral load (4 × 1011), no further increase in L-PBE expression was noted despite increased expression of human PPARα. Peroxisomal catalase level did not change in these livers after Ad/hPPARα (Fig. 2 A) as this gene is not regulated by PPARα (12Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. Cattley R.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1702-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To investigate the time period between recombinant viral infection and the induction of human PPARα to effectuate induction of PPARα-responsive genes in PPARα−/− liver, mice were killed at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days after a single tail vein injection of 1 × 1011 viral particles. As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, hPPARα was barely detectable until day 3, although the expression of L-PBE began to manifest on day 2, suggesting that PPARα target genes are transcriptionally activated as soon as the expression of this receptor ensues. After day 3, the L-PBE levels increased perceptibly with maximum expression between 4 and 6 days (Fig. 2 B). PPARα−/− mice that did not receive Wy-14,643 failed to show L-PBE induction when infected with Ad/mPPARα (Fig. 2 C, lane 2) or Ad/hPPARα (Fig. 2 C, lane 7) suggesting that the natural/biological ligands are insufficient to activate the introduced mPPARα or hPPARα as these ligands can be effectively metabolized by the peroxisomal AOX (14Fan C.Y.

Res. 2000; 448: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We determined the dose response to ascertain the comparative sensitivity of normalized expression of human and mouse PPARα in PPAR-null liver to Wy-14,643 (Fig. 2, Cand D). The data indicate that both mouse and human PPARα respond similarly to a given dose of Wy-14,643 as determined by the expression of L-PBE. To fully evaluate the effect of human PPARα in the PPARα-null mouse liver, we injected 1 × 1011 viral particles intravenously and analyzed livers of mice killed on days 4 and 6 after infection for peroxisome proliferation and peroxisome proliferator-induced immediate pleiotropic responses (Figs. 3 and 4). Nearly 60% of hepatocytes stained positively for β-galactosidase activity in PPARα−/−mice injected with Ad/LacZ and killed 4 or 6 days after injection (Fig. 3 A). Likewise ∼60–70% of hepatocytes expressed hPPARα transgene at immunohistochemically detectable levels between 4 and 6 days postinjection (Fig. 3 B). As expected, control PPARα−/− livers revealed no PPARα expression (Figs. 2, 3 C, and 4). No significant inflammatory infiltrate was detected in any of the livers infected with Ad/hPPARα during the 6-day duration of this study. Hepatic peroxisome proliferation in PPARα−/− mice that were fed either control diet or Wy-14,643-containing diet and infected with Ad/hPPARα transgene was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for L-PBE (Fig. 3, D and E).

Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) is a paradigm enzyme that uses a base flipping mechanism to catalyze the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of 2′-deoxyuridine (2′-dUrd) in DNA as the first step in uracil base excision repair. Flipping of 2′-dUrd by UDG has been proposed to follow a “pushing” mechanism in which a completely conserved leucine side chain (Leu-191) is inserted into the DNA minor groove to expel the uracil. Here we report a novel implementation of the “chemical rescue” approach to show that the weak binding affinity and low catalytic activity of L191A or L191G can be completely or partially restored by substitution of a pyrene (Y) nucleotide wedge on the DNA strand opposite to the uracil base (U/A to U/Y). These results indicate that pyrene acts both as a wedge to push the uracil from the base stack in the free DNA and as a “plug” to hinder its reinsertion after base flipping. Pyrene rescue should serve as a useful and novel tool to diagnose the functional roles of other amino acid side chains involved in base flipping.

Blumenthal R.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This enzyme-induced conformational change in the DNA is a prerequisite for many enzymes to catalyze various chemical transformations on the base that require access to its functional groups. DNA glycosylases, which catalyze the first step in DNA base excision repair, are one general enzyme class that must act through a base flipping mechanism (2Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Hosfield D.J. Tainer J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The most prevalent type of spontaneous DNA damage is that brought about by cytosine deamination, or the misincorporation of dUTP into DNA during replication, resulting in the presence of uracil in DNA. The cytosine deamination route leads to G → U mismatches that ultimately can lead to G → C to A → T transition mutations after two rounds of DNA replication. Thus, a uracil DNA glycosylase activity has evolved to combat this unrelenting source of genomic instability. Flipping of 2′-dUrd by UDG1has been proposed to follow a “pinch-push-pull” mechanism in which a trio of serine residues pinches the DNA backbone producing a localized stress in the DNA (3Parikh S.S.

The pinch-push-pull mechanism appears to represent a highly conserved mechanism to promote base flipping, because corresponding interactions have been found in the structures of all DNA glycosylase-DNA complexes (6Hollis T.

Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In stopped-flow fluorescence studies, the overall base flipping process has been shown to be extremely rapid (kflip ∼ 1200 s−1), assisted by the enzyme, and about 10-fold faster than the chemical step of glycosidic bond cleavage (kcl ∼ 150 s−1). The specificity of the enzyme for flipping and cleavage of uracil, as opposed to all other naturally occurring DNA bases, was shown to be derived from steric exclusion of other bases and from hydrogen bond complementarity of the active site with uracil (9Xiao G. Tordova M. Jagadeesh J. Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Gilliland G.L. Proteins. 1999; 35: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

Biol. 1999; 9: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), our understanding of the forces that give rise to extrahelical bases and the nature of the reaction pathway for base flipping is lacking. One approach to test our understanding of this process is to generate substrate analogs or enzyme mutants that lack functional groups that are hypothesized to be essential for the process, and then probe the damaging effect of the perturbation using biophysical methods. Conversely, the generation of substrate analogs or small molecules that “rescue” the damaging effects of enzyme mutations can provide valuable insights into the role of a functional group in the mechanism. In this report we use both approaches to test the proposed pushing role of Leu-191 of UDG in uracil flipping (see Fig. 1 A). Deletion of this side chain results in a 10- to 625-fold decrease in kcat/Km using duplex DNA substrates containing a single U/P or U/A base pair (where P is the fluorescent adenine analog 2-aminopurine). We then tested the proposed role of this residue by inserting a pyrene nucleotide analog opposite to the uracil (Fig. 1 A). We surmised that the bulky pyrene “base,” which fills the entire space normally occupied by the normal U/A or U/P base pair (see Fig. 1 B), might serve as a mechanical wedge to either force the uracil from the DNA base stack in the free DNA (pushing), or hinder its reinsertion once it is expelled in the UDG complex (plugging). We show here that pyrene completely rescues the damaging effects of the L191A and L191G mutations on site-specific DNA binding. In addition, pyrene totally rescues the damaging kinetic effects of the L191A mutation and partially rescues the kinetic parameters of L191G. The data support a mechanism in which pyrene wedges the uracil from the base stack in the free DNA, and then plugs the hole after the base departs (see Fig. 1 C). One major role of Leu-191 appears to involve plugging the cavity that is left behind after the pinching forces have expelled the uracil, thereby increasing the lifetime of the extrahelical base. Because similar bulky amino acid side chains are involved in other DNA glycosylase base flips, a revised “pinch-push-plug-pull” mechanism for base flipping is suggested. These results further demonstrate the remarkable utility of nonpolar nucleoside analogs in the study of nucleic acid-protein recognition (13Kool E.T. Morales J.C. Guckian K.M. Angew. Chem.-Int. Ed. 2000; 39: 990-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A remarkable and evolutionarily conserved aspect of enzymatic recognition of damaged bases in DNA is the process of base flipping (1Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This enzyme-induced conformational change in the DNA is a prerequisite for many enzymes to catalyze various chemical transformations on the base that require access to its functional groups. DNA glycosylases, which catalyze the first step in DNA base excision repair, are one general enzyme class that must act through a base flipping mechanism (2Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Hosfield D.J. Tainer J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The most prevalent type of spontaneous DNA damage is that brought about by cytosine deamination, or the misincorporation of dUTP into DNA during replication, resulting in the presence of uracil in DNA. The cytosine deamination route leads to G → U mismatches that ultimately can lead to G → C to A → T transition mutations after two rounds of DNA replication. Thus, a uracil DNA glycosylase activity has evolved to combat this unrelenting source of genomic instability. Flipping of 2′-dUrd by UDG1has been proposed to follow a “pinch-push-pull” mechanism in which a trio of serine residues pinches the DNA backbone producing a localized stress in the DNA (3Parikh S.S. Walcher G. Jones G.D. Slupphaug G. Krokan H.E. Blackburn G.M. Tainer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5083-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 4Parikh S.S. Mol C.D.

The pinch-push-pull mechanism appears to represent a highly conserved mechanism to promote base flipping, because corresponding interactions have been found in the structures of all DNA glycosylase-DNA complexes (6Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.

The kinetic mechanism of base flipping has been studied in significant detail for Escherichia coli UDG (8Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In stopped-flow fluorescence studies, the overall base flipping process has been shown to be extremely rapid (kflip ∼ 1200 s−1), assisted by the enzyme, and about 10-fold faster than the chemical step of glycosidic bond cleavage (kcl ∼ 150 s−1). The specificity of the enzyme for flipping and cleavage of uracil, as opposed to all other naturally occurring DNA bases, was shown to be derived from steric exclusion of other bases and from hydrogen bond complementarity of the active site with uracil (9Xiao G. Tordova M. Jagadeesh J. Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Gilliland G.L. Proteins. 1999; 35: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, UDG does not appear to be highly processive (10Higley M. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1993; 294: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Bennett S.E. Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W.

https://openalex.org/W2099577127,"Intrinsic transcription terminators are functionally defined as sites that bring about termination in vitro with purified RNA polymerase alone. Based on studies in Escherichia coli, intrinsic termination requires a palindromic stretch followed by a trail of T (or U) residues in the coding strand. We have developed a highly efficient algorithm to identify hairpin potential sequences in bacterial genomes in order to build a general model for intrinsic transcription termination. The algorithm was applied to analyze the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. We find that hairpin potential sequences are concentrated in the immediate downstream of stop codons. However, most of these structures either lack the U trail entirely or have a mixed A/U trail reflecting an evolutionarily relaxed requirement for the U trail in the mycobacterial genome. Predicted atypical structures were shown to work efficiently as terminators both inside the mycobacterial cell and in vitro with purified RNA polymerase. The results are discussed in light of the kinetic competition models for transcription termination. The algorithm identifies >90% of experimentally tested terminators in bacteria and is an invaluable tool in identifying transcription units in whole genomes."

Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar and2Mulligan G. Jacks T. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These processes are positively regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs),1 which are negatively modulated by CDK inhibitors (CKIs). The seven mammalian CKIs identified so far belong to two separate families: the cip/kipfamily, which inhibits all CDKs and includes p21, p27, and p57, and the ink4 family, which contains p15, p16, and p18, and specifically inhibits Cdk4 and Cdk6 (see Ref. 3Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar for review). Cell cycle arrest is a prerequisite of terminal differentiation. The retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins has consistently been found to be involved in differentiation processes (4Lipinski M.M. Jacks T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7873-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). CDKs inactivate pRb and may therefore inhibit differentiation (5Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This implies that CKIs can act as positive effectors of cell differentiation. In agreement, the expression pattern and biochemical functions of CKIs also suggest that these proteins might be positive modulators of differentiation (5Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B.

Science. 1995; 267: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The epidermis is a particularly well suited model for the study of the relationship between cell cycle and differentiation. First, proliferation and differentiation are compartmentalized with the proliferative, less differentiated cells confined to the basal layer and the nonproliferative, terminally differentiating cells located in the suprabasal layers. Second, the differentiation program in the epidermis takes place progressively as the committed cells in the basal compartment move upward toward the epidermal surface (see Refs. 10Fuchs E.V. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar and11Byrne C. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar for reviews). Precisely regulated changes of protein expression are associated with this process and facilitate its biochemical characterization. Third, primary keratinocytes can be cultured and manipulated in vitro. Fourth, mouse skin carcinogenesis is a well characterized process that could help in the understanding of many concepts currently applied to human neoplasia. The molecular mechanisms governing epidermal differentiation are still largely unknown, in particular the involvement of molecules modulating cell cycle progression. We have recently reported the involvement of pRb, p107, and p130 during the differentiation of human keratinocytes (12Paramio J.M. Laı́n S. Segrelles C. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a process that also appears to be dependent on E2F transcription factors (13Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Casanova M.L. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41219-41226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Finally, the recent finding that the expression of keratin K10, an early marker of epidermal differentiation, can promote cell cycle arrest in a pRb-dependent manner in keratinocytes (14Paramio J.M. Casanova M.L. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) highlights the relevance of Rb-related proteins in this process. The expression of several CKIs is increased in differentiating keratinocytes (9Parker S.B. Eichele G. Zhang P. Rawls A. Sands A.T. Bradley A. Olson E.N. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

Carcinog. 2000; 29: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the functional relevance of such increased expression is not clear. Although p16 expression is increased in human keratinocytes induced to differentiate in vitro(17Harvat B.L. Wang A. Seth P. Jetten A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the sustained expression of p16 does not induce the differentiation of these cells (17Harvat B.L. Wang A. Seth P. Jetten A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition,ink4a Δ2,3-null animals, which lack both p16ink4a and p19arf, a tumor suppressor gene that derives from an alternate reading frame in the p16ink4a locus, display no overt phenotype (20Serrano M. Lee H.-W. Chin L. Cordon-Cardo C. Beach D. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 27-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). With respect to p21waf, the available data are contradictory. p21-null animals do not display alterations in epidermis in vivo. However, primary keratinocytes derived from these animals fail to express differentiation markers upon calcium-induced in vitrodifferentiation (15Missero C. Di Cunto F. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3065-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sustained expression of p21 inhibits terminal differentiation of mouse keratinocytes (21Di Cunto F. Topley G. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Seth P.K. Dotto G.P. Science. 1998; 280: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), but not of human keratinocytes (17Harvat B.L. Wang A. Seth P. Jetten A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, given the well reported activity of p53 in mouse skin carcinogenesis (22Kemp C.J. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Balmain A. Cell. 1993; 74: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), it might be hypothesized that the absence of p21, one of the major effectors of p53 action on cell cycle progression, would reproduce some of the effects attributable to p53 loss. However, several authors have found the opposite to be the case. Missero et al. (15Missero C. Di Cunto F. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3065-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) described very aggressive tumorigenic behavior of p21-null keratinocytes upon Ha-rastransduction. In agreement, Topley et al. (23Topley G.I. Okuyama R. Gonzales J.G. Conti C.J. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9089-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) reported increased carcinoma formation in vivo, although the number of papillomas was reduced. In contrast, Weinberg et al. (24Weinberg W.C. Montano N.E. Deng C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,25Weinberg W.C. Fernandez-Salas E. Morgan D.L. Shalizi A. Mirosh E. Stanulis E. Deng C. Hennings H. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2050-2054PubMed Google Scholar) observed no such changes either in vivo or in vitro. In view of these contradictory results and given the relevance of ink4a/arf as tumor suppressors (20Serrano M. Lee H.-W. Chin L. Cordon-Cardo C. Beach D. DePinho R.A.

The absence of both loci (but neither separately) was found to severely affect epidermal proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and susceptibility to malignant transformation of mouse epidermal keratinocytes. Mouse colonies carrying an ink4a Δ2,3 mutation (ink4a/arf-deficient) (20Serrano M. Lee H.-W. Chin L. Cordon-Cardo C. Beach D. DePinho R.A.

Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), or both were maintained at the National Center of Biotechnology (Madrid) under standard pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. All mice had a mixed genetic background (C57Bl6/129Sv, 50:50%). p21-null mice were the kind gift of Dr. G. Hannon (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). In each case, primary keratinocytes were derived from 6 to 10 pooled newborn mice homozygous for ink4a Δ2,3, p21, or ink4a Δ2,3/p21 mutations and the corresponding genetically matched wild-type controls. Skin was removed, and epidermis was obtained by trypsinization. Cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (BioWhittaker, Inc.) supplemented with 8% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Inc.). Differentiation was induced by adding calcium up to 1.3 mm in the culture medium for 24 h. TGF-β1 was purchased from Bio-Synthesis Diagnostic Incorporated and used at 1 ng/ml. Primary keratinocytes were labeled by incubation in an appropriate medium containing 10 μm BrdUrd (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h. Cells were then fixed in cold methanol. The detection of BrdUrd incorporation was performed by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as a counterstain. The effect of calcium or TGF-β1 treatment was measured by comparing untreated cells in parallel cultures. In each experiment, at least 500 cells were scored. The number of cells displaying BrdUrd incorporation was normalized to the total number of cells scored. All experiments were performed in triplicate and are shown as means ± S.D. Frozen sections from 4-day-old mice of each genotype were used for hematoxylin/eosin staining or for indirect immunofluorescence as previously described (12Paramio J.M. Laı́n S. Segrelles C.

Total protein extracts were obtained in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 25 μg of protein were used in SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with antibodies against keratins K10, K14, K5, and K6; filaggrin; and loricrin (all from Covance and used at 1:1000 dilutions) or p16, p21, and Ras (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used 1:1000 dilutions). Blots were developed using WestPicosignal (Pierce) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Primary keratinocytes of different genotypes were cultured as described. 2 days after plating, cells were mock- or retrovirus-infected in low calcium medium at a multiplicity of infection of ∼1 for 3 h. Helper-free retrovirus coding for v-Ha-ras was obtained from Ψ2(ras) cells that produce the indicated retrovirus as described by Roop et al.(40Roop D.R. Lowy D.R. Tambourin P.E. Strickland J. Harper J.R. Balaschak M.F. Spangler E. Yuspa S.H. Nature. 1986; 323: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The titer was estimated by foci formation assays in NIH3T3 cells. For in vitro transformation assays, performed 2 days after mock or retroviral infection, primary keratinocytes were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 0.5% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum for 15 days. At this time, the number of colonies was counted after fixation in paraformaldehyde and Giemsa staining. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results are shown as means ± S.D. For in vivo tumorigenicity assays, performed 6 days after mock or retroviral infection, cells were collected after trypsinization, counted, and injected subcutaneously into nude mice at 106 cells/100 μl of PBS. To minimize individual animal variations, cells from the different genotypes were injected in parallel into the same animal at the right or left shoulder or hip. 3–4 weeks later, tumors were collected and fixed in Formalin-buffered saline or in 70% ethanol for histological or immunohistochemical analysis, respectively. Antibodies used were as described for immunofluorescence, but ABC peroxidase detection (Vector Labs, Inc.) was used. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity was detected as described by Dimri et al. (36Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I.

Briefly, frozen sections from 4-day- or 8-month-old mouse skin were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C and subsequently washed five times with PBS (pH 6.0). Sections were then stained with a solution containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 1 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 1 mm MgCl2 in PBS (pH 6.0) for 8–12 h. Mock- or retrovirus-infected primary keratinocytes were similarly stained; but prior to fixation, cells were washed with PBS. To study the possible cooperation between the cip/kip and ink4 families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors,ink4a Δ2,3- and p21-deficient mice were mated. Double mutants were obtained in mendelian ratios, indicating that embryos with complete or partial loss of both ink4a Δ2,3 and p21 functions are viable. Doubly deficient animals displayed no major phenotypic abnormalities compared with parental ink4a Δ2,3-deficient (20Serrano M. Lee H.-W. Chin L. Cordon-Cardo C. Beach D. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 27-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) or p21-deficient (27Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P.

Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) animals up to the age of 8 months. Histological examination of newborn skin revealed no obvious differences between ink4a Δ2,3-, p21-, and ink4a Δ2,3/p21-deficient mice compared with wild-type littermate controls (data not shown). No significant differences were found in the expression patterns of several epidermal differentiation markers such as keratins K14, K5, and K10; filaggrin; and loricrin between controls (Fig. 1,A–E) and ink4a Δ2,3- or p21-deficient mouse epidermis (data not shown). In contrast, the expression of several differentiation markers such as keratin K10, filaggrin, and loricrin decreased in ink4a Δ2,3/p21-deficient mouse epidermis (Fig. 1, A′–C′). Finally, the expression of K6, which is constrained to the hair follicles in wild-type (Fig.1 D) and ink4a Δ2,3- and p21-deficient (data not shown) mouse epidermis, appeared throughout all the suprabasal layers of the interfollicular epidermis in ink4a Δ2,3/p21-deficient mice (Fig.1 D′). These data, which were confirmed by Western blotting of skin extracts (Fig. 1 E), indicate that the simultaneous absence of ink4a Δ2,3 and p21, but not each alone, alters the differentiation program of mouse epidermis. Normal cells proliferate for a finite number of cell divisions, after which they enter a state known as senescence (29Campisi J. Cell. 1996; 84: 497-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Replicative senescence is accompanied by an increase in the levels of p53, p16, and p21 (30Alcorta D.A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4974-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Senescence is also characterized by the accumulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, histochemically detectable at pH 6. This marker was expressed by senescent, but not pre-senescent, fibroblasts and keratinocytes, but was absent in quiescent fibroblasts and terminally differentiated keratinocytes in aged human skin (36Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5787) Google Scholar). In this investigation, the senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining pattern was studied in back skin sections from newborn and 8-month-old mice with wild-type and ink4a Δ2,3-, p21-, and ink4a Δ2,3/p21-deficient genotypes. It is worth mentioning that this procedure cannot be performed with older mice due to the formation of spontaneous tumors in ink4a Δ2,3-deficient animals. In control mice, clear staining was observed in the middle part of the hair follicles (Fig. 2 A, arrows), probably at the sebaceous glands. This was also observed in newborn mouse skin (data not shown) and was therefore considered not indicative of senescent cells. In addition, clear cytoplasmic staining was observed in a number of epidermal and hair follicle cells (Fig. 2,A (arrowheads and inset),A′, and A“). The localization of these cells and the absence of similar staining in newborn skin strongly support that, as in human epidermis, they might correspond to senescent cells (36Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5787) Google Scholar). A similar senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining pattern was found in the epidermis of aged ink4a Δ2,3- and p21-deficient mice, although the number of these cells was moderately reduced (Fig. 2, B, C, and E). In ink4a Δ2,3/p21-deficient mice, this staining was almost absent (Fig. 2 D), indicating that in these animals, there is decreased age-related senescence in the epidermis. To further characterize the above-mentioned epidermal abnormalities, primary keratinocytes were analyzed. Asynchronous keratinocyte cultures in low calcium medium (0.03 mm) were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd for 3 h, and the percentage of cells that traversed the S phase was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. The results (Fig.3 A) demonstrate a similar labeling index for wild-type controls and ink4a Δ2,3- and p21-deficient keratinocytes. In contrast, ink4a Δ2,3/p21-deficient keratinocytes displayed increased proliferation (Fig. 3 A). To further confirm this observation, similar numbers of keratinocytes of each genotype were plated and cultured in low calcium medium, and the number of viable cells was determined at different times. Similar growth rates in controls and ink4a Δ2,3- and p21-deficient keratinocytes were observed (Fig. 3 B). However, in agreement with BrdUrd labeling experiments,ink4a Δ2,3/p21-deficient keratinocytes grew faster (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that the lack of both ink4a Δ2,3 and p21 leads to increased proliferation. However, at variance with primary murine fibroblasts lacking p53 or ink4a Δ2,3, which are easily established as immortal cell lines (20Serrano M. Lee H.-W. Chin L. Cordon-Cardo C. Beach D.

Cell. 1995; 82: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), permanent cell lines (even of ink4a Δ2,3/p21 keratinocytes) could not be produced (data not shown). This indicates that some proliferative controls are still active in these ink4a Δ2,3/p21-deficient cells. TGFs-β are well characterized regulators of keratinocyte physiology. TGF-β1 treatment induces reversible cell cycle arrest in cells associated with decreased pRb phosphorylation. The response to TGF-β1 treatment of primary keratinocytes derived from each genotype was studied. Cells were incubated in the presence of 1 ng/ml TGF-β for 12 h; and at this time, cell proliferation was monitored by BrdUrd incorporation as described above. It was found that all primary keratinocytes displayed a similar inhibition of BrdUrd incorporation, irrespective of genotype (Fig. 3 C). This indicates that the absence of ink4a/arf and p21 does not affect TGF-β-induced growth arrest and confirms the existence of active growth control mechanisms in the absence of these genes. Mouse keratinocyte differentiation can be induced in vitro by increasing the calcium concentration from 0.03 to 1.3 mm. High calcium levels trigger severe morphological changes in keratinocytes, followed by the sequential expression of several differentiation markers and the inhibition of cell proliferation, thus recapitulating many features of in vivo differentiation. The response to increased calcium concentration displayed by primary keratinocytes derived from newborn mice of each genotype was analyzed. Similar inhibition of BrdUrd incorporation was observed in all cases, indicating that despite displaying enhanced growth capability in low calcium (Fig. 3), ink4a Δ2,3/p21-deficient keratinocytes underwent growth arrest upon calcium-induced differentiation (Fig. 4 A). Calcium-induced expression of differentiation markers was then analyzed. 24 h after the calcium switch, the expression of keratin K10 and filaggrin was severely decreased in doubly deficient keratinocytes (Fig. 4, B–D). These results indicate that, in agreement with the observed differentiation abnormalities in epidermis in vivo, the lack of ink4a/arf and p21 also leads to impaired differentiation of mouse primary keratinocytes in culture. The activation of the Ha-ras oncogene is the primary event during mouse skin chemical carcinogenesis (39Quintanilla M. Brown K. Ramsden M. Balmain A. Nature. 1986; 322: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In addition, the retroviral transduction of the Ha-ras oncogene in mouse primary keratinocytes appears to be sufficient to induce tumor formation (40Roop D.R. Lowy D.R. Tambourin P.E. Strickland J.

Furthermore, it has been shown that oncogenic Ha-ras induces premature cell senescence in association with increased expression of p16 and p21 in primary fibroblasts (33Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M.

The vaccinia virus strain Lister and many other poxviruses express soluble proteins (vCCI) that bind MCP-1 and other CC chemokines and inhibit their function. In order to define the interaction site of MCP-1 with vCCI from vaccinia, surface exposed residues of MCP-1 were identified and mutated to alanine. The MCP-1 variants were expressed, purified, and their interaction with vCCI was characterized. The site on MCP-1 for vCCI binding is dominated by arginine 18 with important additional contributions from tyrosine 13 and arginine 24. These residues define a binding site that largely overlaps with the CCR2B receptor interaction site. The viral chemokine-binding protein vCCI thus inhibits the biological function of MCP-1 by directly masking its CCR2B receptor-binding site.

The two major subfamilies are the CXC chemokines which act on neutrophils and non-hemopoietic cells and the CC chemokines which bind to receptors mainly expressed on monocytes, T cells, eosinophils, and basophils. Additional members of the chemokine family are the C chemokine lymphotactin and the CX3C chemokine fraktalkine. Chemokines are important for the development, homeostasis, and function of the immune system and play a pivotal role in host defense (for reviews, see Refs.1Rollins B.J.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3289) Google Scholar). Given the importance of chemokines for defense against pathogens it is no surprise that viruses themselves developed mechanisms to neutralize the function of chemokines to further their own propagation or evade host defense (4Murphy P.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Poxviruses express secreted chemokine neutralizing proteins termed virus-encoded chemokine-binding proteins (vCKBP).1 Two families of vCKBPs have thus far been identified that use distinct mechanisms of chemokine neutralization (5Lalani A.S. Barrett J.W. McFadden G. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 100-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The vCKBP-1 family binds C, CC, and CXC chemokines with low affinity, possibly by interaction with the proteoglycan-binding site on chemokines, thereby interfering with the proper localization and presentation of chemokines in inflamed tissues (6Lalani A.S.

The vCKBP-2 from vaccinia virus strain Lister (vCCI, viral CC chemokine inhibitor) (11Patel A.H. Gaffney D.F. Subak-Sharpe J.H. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has been cloned and characterized in vitro(9Alcami A. Symons J.A. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. Smith G.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 624-633PubMed Google Scholar). It binds CC chemokines with high affinity (K D = 100–150 pm) and blocks their interaction with cellular receptors. Moreover, the three-dimensional structure of the highly related vCKBP-2 from cowpox was determined by x-ray crystallography and revealed a novel β-sandwich topology not found in any other protein (16Carfi A.

Although it has been suggested that vCCI binds to CC chemokines through residues distinct from the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding site, the exact nature of the vCCI interaction site on CC chemokines is unknown. In this study, the entire surface of a well characterized member of the CC chemokine family, human monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (17Yoshimura T. Robinson E.A. Tanaka S. Appella E.

Med. 1989; 169: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) was probed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify residues important for the interaction with vCCI. The results define the surface on MCP-1 that is used to bind vCCI and show that vCCI partially masks the CCR2B receptor interaction site on MCP-1. Moreover, insights on how vCCI can interact with a large number of structurally diverse CC chemokines are provided. The human MCP-1 gene was cloned from a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library which was synthesized from activated human leukocytes (CLONTECH). The oligonucleotides used to amplify the human MCP-1 gene were caggtcaatgtcgacTCGCCTCCAGCATGAAAGTCTCTGCC and caggtcaattctaga TCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAGTCTTCGGAGTTTGGGTTTG (the start and the stop codon are shown in bold, lowercase nucleotides indicate restriction sites and cleavable extensions). The oligonucleotides incorporated SalI and XbaI sites (underlined), respectively, for cloning into the mammalian expression vector pRS5a (a modification of pRK5 (Pharmingen) provided by S. Geisse, Novartis Pharma AG). Moreover, the 3′-amplification oligonucleotide incorporated a C-terminal (His)6 tag for detection and purification purposes. In the polymerase chain reaction, 0.4 μg of the cDNA library were amplified with Pfu polymerase (Promega) using the following protocol: 2 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, 5 min at 72 °C. The amplified fragments were isolated, digested with SalI/XbaI, and cloned into pRS5a. Mutations were introduced into the MCP-1 cDNA by using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and high performance liquid chromatography purified oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutations. The day prior to the transfection, 2 × 105/well HEK.EBNA cells were seeded into 6-well plates. Two micrograms of pRS5a expression plasmids carrying the MCP-1 sequences and 10 μl of Geneporter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) were each separately diluted in 500 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The diluted DNA was added to the diluted transfection reagent and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The culture medium was aspirated from the cells and the DNA/transfection reagent mixture was carefully added to the cells and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum were added and the cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C. The supernatants were then collected, centrifuged for 5 min, and subjected to purification prior to storage at −20 °C. To the 3 ml of culture supernatant containing the secreted MCP-1 protein, imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. To this solution 100 μl of Ni-NTA Magnetic Agarose Beads (Qiagen) were added and the suspension was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a spinning wheel. The beads were separated from the solution with a 12-tube magnet (Qiagen) and washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0). The bound MCP-1 was eluted with 200 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mmNaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) by resuspending the beads and incubation at room temperature for 1 min. The concentration of purified MCP-1 was measured with a Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) or by anti-MCP-1 ELISA (Biomol). Mutant MCP-1 concentrations were determined using the Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with purified MCP-1 as standard. Typically 40 μg of purified human MCP-1 or MCP-1 mutants were obtained from 3 ml of culture. The purity of expressed MCP-1 proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE on 18% pre-cast gels (Novagen). The gels were stained with GelCode Blue Stain (Pierce). An ELISA was developed to measure binding affinities of MCP-1 and mutant MCP-1 to the vCCI protein which was fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (R + D Systems). 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated with 100 μl of goat F(ab′)2 anti-human IgG Fc (Cappel) at a concentration of 3.2 μg/ml and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The plates were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, azide using a plate washer (Tecan). Excess binding sites on the plates were blocked by adding 300 μl/well of blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) for 90 min. The plates were washed and 100 μl/well vCCI was added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with constant agitation. The plates were washed and serial dilutions of MCP-1 (0–2700 ng/ml) or MCP-1 mutants (0–8100 ng/ml) in blocking buffer were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with constant agitation. After washing, 100 μl/well of a biotinylated polyclonal anti-human MCP-1 antibody (R+D Systems) in blocking buffer was added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml, incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to streptavidin (1:3000, Immuno Research) for 30 min at room temperature. The color was developed for 30 min with 100 μl/well p-nitrophenyl phosphate (0.14 mg/ml) in diethanolamine buffer (0.97% in water, pH 9.8). The enzymatic reaction was stopped with 50 μl/well of 1.5 mNaOH and the absorption was measured at 405 and 490 nm with a Spectra Max 250 reader (Molecular Devices). Dose-response curves were fitted to a four-parameter logistic function. EC50 values of MCP-1 mutants were normalized to the EC50 observed with MCP-1 (24.9 ng/ml). Certified BIAcore sensorchips CM-5 (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) were utilized throughout this study. For activation of the carboxymethylated dextran layer, equal volumes of 0.2m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide (BIAcore “Amine coupling kit”) were premixed by the autosampler of the instrument, and 35 μl of the mixture were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A 30 μg/ml solution of anti-human Fcγ antibody (Jackson Immunochemicals), prepared by diluting the stock solution into 10 mm acetic acid, pH 4.5, was then injected at 5 μl/min for 3 min to yield an increase in resonance units of about 10,000. Remaining activated N-hydroxysuccinimide groups were quenched during a pulse of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, and the surface was exposed to a regeneration procedure of two injections of 20 mm HCl. Next, vCCI was accumulated on the surface by injecting 5 μl of a 5 μg/ml solution, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. This procedure yielded about 200 to 300 resonance units (statistics of a representative experiment: 268 ± 2 resonance units; mean ± S.E.; n = 35), and was repeated each time after a regeneration and before the injection of chemokine. Dilutions of MCP-1 or MCP-1 mutants were prepared in BIAbuffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) to yield final concentrations of 2 to 20 nm. Association was followed for 12.5 min, dissociation for 5 min, and the flow rate was kept at at 20 μl/min. Each cycle was finished by two 30-s pulses of 100 mm HCl at 20 μl/min. After subtraction of the sensorgram obtained by injecting BIAbuffer, the titration series was analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore). TheK D values given for the mutants are the average ofK D values determined from individual injections and are not calculated from the average kon andkoff values shown in Table III.Table IIIActivation of the CCR2B receptor by MCP-1 mutants and binding to a panel of monoclonal anti-MCP-1 antibodiesMCP-1 variantCa2+mobilizationS101S8S14S3829G10MCP-1100 ± 71.00 ± 0.041.00 ± 0.051.00 ± 0.041.00 ± 0.061.00 ± 0.02P8A129 ± 81.25 ± 0.073.04 ± 0.421.62 ± 0.053.16 ± 0.271.03 ± 0.08V9A90 ± 81.21 ± 0.021.82 ± 0.100.73 ± 0.041.95 ± 0.100.25 ± 0.02T10A36 ± 141.01 ± 0.021.27 ± 0.050.61 ± 0.061.23 ± 0.100.42 ± 0.05Y13A1 ± 11.16 ± 0.112.03 ± 0.181.03 ± 0.071.85 ± 0.260.94 ± 0.12N14A94 ± 30.92 ± 0.030.81 ± 0.040.64 ± 0.080.84 ± 0.040.56 ± 0.05F15A45 ± 91.22 ± 0.031.65 ± 0.120.74 ± 0.031.72 ± 0.050.42 ± 0.04T16A95 ± 100.90 ± 0.040.80 ± 0.030.89 ± 0.070.74 ± 0.140.79 ± 0.07N17A96 ± 60.93 ± 0.040.99 ± 0.030.96 ± 0.050.96 ± 0.030.97 ± 0.10R18A76 ± 40.28 ± 0.030.10 ± 0.020.37 ± 0.040.40 ± 0.070.25 ± 0.03K19A88 ± 40.45 ± 0.060.15 ± 0.020.72 ± 0.030.48 ± 0.030.60 ± 0.06I20A79 ± 71.21 ± 0.151.58 ± 0.120.46 ± 0.022.25 ± 0.290.16 ± 0.12R24A4 ± 10.68 ± 0.060.38 ± 0.060.08 ± 0.020.82 ± 0.180.01 ± 0.02Y28A71 ± 111.22 ± 0.031.88 ± 0.160.83 ± 0.022.29 ± 0.090.46 ± 0.03I31A2 ± 10.96 ± 0.101.08 ± 0.060.82 ± 0.051.00 ± 0.520.67 ± 0.04K35A37 ± 80.89 ± 0.030.81 ± 0.020.79 ± 0.040.85 ± 0.040.54 ± 0.06K38A45 ± 21.01 ± 0.171.08 ± 0.081.18 ± 0.051.28 ± 0.091.34 ± 0.14I42A1 ± 11.34 ± 0.132.19 ± 0.130.62 ± 0.051.95 ± 0.120.24 ± 0.05K49A4 ± 10.91 ± 0.020.78 ± 0.040.58 ± 0.040.85 ± 0.050.38 ± 0.06I51A92 ± 41.09 ± 0.121.23 ± 0.080.57 ± 0.021.86 ± 0.250.28 ± 0.05D54A86 ± 81.13 ± 0.031.18 ± 0.050.74 ± 0.031.36 ± 0.100.96 ± 0.12K56A98 ± 110.90 ± 0.050.60 ± 0.050.91 ± 0.051.07 ± 0.230.89 ± 0.16Q57A96 ± 30.97 ± 0.130.30 ± 0.190.93 ± 0.040.91 ± 0.120.83 ± 0.10K58A99 ± 50.01 ± 0.010.02 ± 0.010.73 ± 0.050.00 ± 0.030.46 ± 0.04Q61A96 ± 50.28 ± 0.050.12 ± 0.031.0 ± 0.080.23 ± 0.071.13 ± 0.15M64A84 ± 60.35 ± 0.120.36 ± 0.021.28 ± 0.180.26 ± 0.101.81 ± 0.34D65A99 ± 50.94 ± 0.071.48 ± 0.040.90 ± 0.121.20 ± 0.080.86 ± 0.05Δ MCP-12 ± 11.22 ± 0.062.72 ± 0.411.08 ± 0.032.48 ± 0.120.72 ± 0.18Tyr-13Arg-18Arg-18Arg-24Lys-58Val-9Arg-24Lys-58Lys-19Gln-61Arg-18Ile-31Gln-61Lys-58Ile-20Ile-42Gln-61Arg-24Lys-49Ile-42N terminusIle-51Ca2+ mobilization in CHO cells expressing CCR2B was measured at 1 nm MCP-1 or mutant MCP-1.

The cells were loaded with 3 μm Fura Red (Molecular Probes, emission at 660 nm) and 1.5 μm Fluo3 (Molecular Probes, emission at 530 nm) in the presence of 0.04% pluronic acid (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes with Hanks' balanced salt solution, HEPES, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, the cells were ready for stimulation with MCP-1 or MCP-1 mutants. Fluorescence emission in response to MCP-1 was measured at room temperature with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) and the ratio of green and red fluorescence was calculated (20Novak E.J. Rabinovitch P.S. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with the FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc.). The values measured with MCP-1 were normalized to 100% and the signals obtained with MCP-1 mutants were expressed relative to this. Results shown are the mean of two independent experiments with triplicate values in each experiment. In order to assess the structural integrity of MCP-1 mutants, their ability to interact with a panel of five monoclonal antibodies directed against human MCP-1 (Anogen: S8, S14, S101, S382, and 9G10) was measured in ELISAs using Ni-NTA HisSorp strips (Qiagen). MCP-1 mutants were bound via their C-terminal (His)6 tag to the Ni-NTA on the solid support. Bound MCP-1 mutants were detected with the monoclonal antibodies and the relative binding compared with MCP-1 was calculated. MCP-1 or mutants were added to the wells at 2700 ng/ml in 50 μl of blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed and monoclonal antibodies S8 or S101 were added at 500 ng/μl. For the monoclonal antibodies S14, S382, and 9G10 a concentration of 2000 ng/μl was used. The plates were kept for 2 h at room temperature and then washed. Bound monoclonal antibodies were detected with 1:7500 diluted horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, 30 min at room temperature). The color was developed by addition of 50 μl/well of BM blue horseradish peroxidase substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubation for 15 min. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl/well of 1 mH2SO4 and the absorption was measured at 450 and 690 nm on a Spectra Max 250 (Molecular Devices). Mutant MCP-1 binding to the five monoclonal antibodies was determined twice independently with triplicate values in each experiment and normalized to the values obtained for MCP-1 binding. Prior to normalization, the values were corrected for the absorption measured with buffer alone which accounted always for less than 5% of total binding. The three-dimensional structure of MCP-1 was determined by NMR (21Handel T.M. Domaille P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6569-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (22Lubkowski J. Bujacz G. Boqué L. Domaille P.J. Handel T.M. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We identified surface-exposed residues by visual inspection of the MCP-1 structure and probed a total of 57 residues that could potentially interact with vCCI by alanine-scanning mutagenesis (23Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). This approach has been successfully applied to define protein-protein interfaces of growth hormone/growth hormone receptor (24Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar), neurotrophin/receptor interactions (25Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. Soppet D. Escandon E. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5896-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and other ligand/receptor pairs (26Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Alanine can adopt the dihedral angles of all secondary structural elements in proteins and mutation to alanine is thus not expected to perturb the structure of the mutated MCP-1 variants. Residues that are likely involved in maintaining the overall integrity of the MCP-1 structure were not analyzed. These residues included amino acids forming disulfides, Cys-11, Cys-12, Cys-36, and Cys-52 as well as amino acids involved in hydrophobic core formation, Leu-25, Val-41, Phe-43, Trp-59, Val-60, and Leu-67. Finally, proline and alanine residues were generally not probed (Pro-2, Ala-4, Ala-26, Pro-37, Ala-40, Ala-53, Pro-55, and Pro-74). MCP-1 and MCP-1 mutants were transiently expressed in HEK.EBNA cells and proteins were purified from conditioned medium using Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Peptide mapping of the purified protein followed by N-terminal sequencing of the fragments yielded the expected sequence (data not shown). Expressed and purified MCP-1 induced a similar dose response as Escherichia coli-derived commercially available MCP-1 (R+D Systems) in Ca2+ mobilization assays using CHO/CCR2B cells (data not shown). The affinity of MCP-1 to vCCI was determined by SPR. The K D for this interaction was 294 ± 22 pm with kon = 2.47 ± 0.14 m−1 s−1 × 106 and koff = 6.79 ± 0.33 s−1 × 10−4. The most important residue for the interaction of MCP-1 with vCCI was discovered by analysis of the mutation R18A. This mutation caused a more than 10-fold increase in the EC50value in the ELISA (Table I). This result was confirmed by SPR measurements using the BIAcore instrument where no specific binding could be detected for this mutant (TableII). The mutation R18A thus strongly affects binding to vCCI. In order to ensure that the overall structure of this mutation was not perturbed, we determined the functional response mediated through the human CCR2B receptor by measuring the Ca2+ mobilization in CHO/CCR2B cells. The CCR2B response was first titrated with MCP-1 and a half-maximal response was observed at 1 nm (data not shown). Subsequently, all mutants were assessed at 1 nm in order to ensure maximal sensitivity of the functional assay. R18A activates CCR2B with an efficacy of 76 ± 3% of the MCP-1 response at 1 nm, indicating that Arg-18 is not crucially important for the MCP-1 interaction with CCR2B (Table III). This mutant has also been shown to have full binding affinity to THP-1 cells and to a recombinant cell line expressing the CCR2B receptor (28Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13013-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A loss in activity of a protein upon mutation of a side chain can be attributed either to the importance of this side chain to the function of the protein or to an involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of the protein. An additional method to verify the structural integrity of mutants with reduced activity is to determine their reactivities against a panel of monoclonal antibodies (26Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The interaction of the R18A mutant with a panel of five monoclonal anti-MCP-1 antibodies was assessed and it was found that the residue Arg-18 is important for the interaction with S8 but not S14 and S382 (Table III). Therefore, the strong activity of R18A on the CCR2B receptor and its interaction with two of the monoclonal antibodies suggests that the overall structure of R18A is intact and that the large decrease of affinity to vCCI is due to the removal of a functional group crucial for this particular interaction. Hence, Arg-18 is the major determinant on MCP-1 for binding to vCCI.Table IBinding of vCCI to MCP-1 mutants assessed by ELISAMCP-1 variantEC50(mut)/(MCP-1)MCP-11.00 ± 0.29N terminus Q1A1.01 ± 0.47 D3A1.05 ± 0.22 D3K1.34 ± 0.11 I5A1.19 ± 0.49 N6A1.17 ± 0.28 P8A0.60 ± 0.20 β0 V9A0.32 ± 0.05 T10A1.48 ± 0.45 β0–310 Y13A10.94 ± 2.22 N14A1.57 ± 1.04 F15A3.55 ± 0.90 T16A0.35 ± 0.03 N17A1.06 ± 0.27 R18A10.49 ± 3.21 K19A2.30 ± 0.23 I20A1.53 ± 0.30 310 S21A1.05 ± 0.37 V22A0.51 ± 0.05 Q23A0.43 ± 0.11 R24A6.19 ± 2.35 β1 S27A0.77 ± 0.10 Y28A3.95 ± 1.08 R29A0.39 ± 0.08 R30A1.81 ± 0.72 I31A0.98 ± 0.22 β1–β2 T32A1.14 ± 0.34 S33A1.49 ± 0.32 S34A0.95 ± 0.24 K35A0.68 ± 0.18 K38A1.90 ± 0.34 E39A1.12 ± 0.40 β2 I42A4.38 ± 2.15 K44A0.47 ± 0.10 T45A1.17 ± 0.30 β2–β3 I46A0.48 ± 0.05 V47A0.40 ± 0.03 A48K0.42 ± 0.05 K49A0.09 ± 0.01 E50A1.21 ± 0.07 β3 I51A1.40 ± 0.08 D54A3.68 ± 1.51 β3–α1 K56A3.30 ± 0.81 Q57A0.38 ± 0.08 α1 K58A0.67 ± 0.19 Q61A0.62 ± 0.10 D62A0.47 ± 0.07 S63A0.80 ± 0.89 M64A2.52 ± 0.78 D65A1.25 ± 0.31 H66A0.54 ± 0.10 D68A1.28 ± 0.37 K69A0.48 ± 0.06C terminus Q70A0.95 ± 0.38 T71A0.87 ± 0.17 Q72A1.68 ± 0.84 T73A1.57 ± 1.12 K75A1.18 ± 0.17 T76A1.12 ± 0.18Binding results are shown as the mean ± S.D. of four independent dose-response experiments with two independently expressed, purified and quantified sets of mutants.

Promiscuously immunodominant helper T-cell epitopes in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein gp120 could be important in the development of broadly protective immunity, but the underlying mechanisms of immunodominance and promiscuity remain poorly defined. In this study, gp120 helper T-cell epitopes were systematically mapped in CBA/J and BALB/c mice by restimulation assays using a set of overlapping peptides spanning the entire sequence of the gp120 encoded by HIV strain 89.6. The results were analyzed in the context of the HIV gp120 structure determined by x-ray crystallography. One major finding was that all of the promiscuously immunodominant gp120 sequences are located in the outer domain. Further analyses indicated that epitope immunogenicity in the outer domain correlates with structural disorder in adjacent N-terminal segments, as indicated by crystallographic B-factors or sequence divergence. In contrast, the correlation was poor when the analysis encompassed the entire gp120 sequence or was restricted to only the inner domain. These findings suggest that local disorder promotes the processing and presentation of adjacent epitopes in the outer domain of gp120 and therefore reveal how three-dimensional structure shapes the profile of helper T-cell epitope immunogenicity.

Although much progress has been made in understanding the HIV virus since it was first isolated in 1983, no effective vaccines against HIV are yet available. It is well documented that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute an important effector mechanism for clearance and control of HIV infections and that a specific infectivity-neutralizing antibody can prevent HIV infections (1Nabel G.J. Nature. 2001; 410: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). CD4+ helper T lymphocytes are required for the generation of these effector mechanisms. Therefore, an effective vaccine must be able to elicit potent helper T-cell responses. Although immunodominant epitopes are consistently exposed to immune surveillance, they may not promote development of protective immunity. Thus, it is of interest to characterize immunodominant epitopes and identify the mechanisms that are responsible for immunodominance. Immunodominant epitopes have been identified by strength and frequency in the lymphocyte recall response (2Sercarz E.E. Lehmann P.V. Ametani A. Benichou G. Miller A. Moudgil K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 729-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar).

Immunol. 1990; 2: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In many mapping studies, lymphocytes from a group of inbred mice were pooled, and thus the frequency of response was not available (6Gao X.M. Liew F.Y. Tite J.P. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3007-3014PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gammon G. Geysen H.M. Apple R.J. Pickett E. Palmer M. Ametani A. Sercarz E.E. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 908-918PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, epitope immunodominance was based strictly on stimulation index (SI), the level of peptide-stimulated proliferation divided by the level of unstimulated proliferation. In studies on outbred populations, strength and frequency have been treated independently (9Schrier R.D. Gnann Jr., J.W. Landes R. Lockshin C. Richman D. McCutchan A. Kennedy C. Oldstone M.B.

Okita D.K. Banaszak L. Conti-Fine B.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In human subjects sensitized to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, the SI for the most common epitopes correlated with SI for the whole antigen, suggesting that the dominant epitope-specific responses were responsible for most of the response to the antigen (11Diethelm-Okita B.M. Okita D.K. Banaszak L. Conti-Fine B.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because these subjects were heterogeneous with respect to MHC alleles, peptide affinity for the MHC protein probably was not the controlling factor. Available methods of predicting T-cell epitopes score antigen sequences by preference for binding to MHC antigen-presenting proteins (12Meister G.E. Roberts C.G. Berzofsky J.A. de Groot A.S. Vaccine. 1995; 13: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Roberts C.G. Meister G.E. Jesdale B.M. Lieberman J. Berzofsky J.A. de Groot A.S. AIDS Res. Hum.

These methods have been more successful for MHC class I-restricted CTL epitopes than for MHC class II-restricted helper T-cell epitopes (14Stevanovíc S. Rammensee H.-G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Structure of Antigens. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 61-90Google Scholar). CTL epitopes typically are few and consistent among individuals with a given MHC haplotype. In contrast, a large fraction of antigen sequence is able to stimulate helper T-cell proliferation, and there is a great variation in the breadth and intensity of the response, even among inbred animals. Moreover, CTL epitopes seem to be largely context-independent (14Stevanovíc S. Rammensee H.-G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Structure of Antigens. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 61-90Google Scholar), whereas helper T-cell epitopes often become cryptic in an unnatural context (17Janssen R. Wauben M. van der Zee R. de Gast M. Tommassen J. Int.

At least two differences in the processing and presentation machinery contribute to the different behaviors of the two types of epitopes. First, the ends of the peptide-binding groove in MHC class I proteins are closed, whereas they are open in MHC class II proteins (23Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Structure. 1994; 2: 245-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Second, the cytoplasmic proteasome generates peptides for presentation to CTL (24York I.A. Goldberg A.L. Mo X.Y. Rock K.L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25Niedermann G. Geier E. Lucchiari-Hartz M. Hitziger N. Ramsperger A. Eichmann K. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas lysosomal proteases generate peptides for presentation to helper T-cells (26Nakagawa T.Y. Rudensky A.Y. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27Villadangos J.A. Bryant R.A. Deussing J. Driessen C. Lennon-Dumenil A.M. Riese R.J. Roth W. Saftig P. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Peters C. Ploegh H.L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Antigen primary sequence influences helper T-cell epitope immunodominance at several levels of processing and presentation. First, landmark studies have shown that a suitable arrangement of two or three residues in the antigen primary sequence plays an important part in determining binding affinity for the MHC class II protein (28DeLisi C. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7048-7052Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 29Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Busch R. Rothbard J. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C.

S. A. 1994; 91: 4456-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The various MHC alleles exhibit distinct anchor residue preferences, and thus epitope patterns can be quite different between individuals with different alleles. Second, residues beyond the MHC-binding sequence influence binding to the MHC protein (32Nelson C.A. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 33Moudgil K.D. Grewal I.S. Jensen P.E. Sercarz E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Third, the primary sequence has the capacity to influence epitope immunodominance at the level of tertiary structure in the antigen. For example, the overall immunogenicity of tetanus toxoid antigen is determined by susceptibility to proteolysis by a single protease at a single cleavage site (34Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, presentation of any and all epitopes of this antigen depends on this first cleavage step, which may be necessary to destabilize the protein structure and facilitate downstream processing. Nevertheless, almost all epitope mapping studies have focused solely on how primary sequence affects immunodominance at the level of binding to the MHC protein. The limited number of systematic mapping studies and the recent crystallographic determination of the HIV gp120 structure (35Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar) warrant a systematic examination of helper T-cell epitope immunodominance in gp120. Several studies identified helper T-cell epitopes in gp120 and related molecules, gp140 and gp160, in experimental animals and infected humans. However, the early studies in mice did not systematically sample the entire gp120 sequence (36Hale P.M. Cease K.B. Houghten R.A. Ouyang C. Putney S. Javaherian K. Margalit H. Cornette J.L. Spouge J.L. DeLisi C. Berzofsky J.A. Int. Immunol. 1989; 1: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Sjolander S. Hansen J.S. Bengtsson K.L. Akerblom L. Morein B. Vaccine. 1996; 14: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Studies in humans were even less systematic in that they sampled individuals who were heterogeneous in MHC haplotype, had been exposed to undefined HIV strains, and were probably at various levels of disease progression (9Schrier R.D. Gnann Jr., J.W. Landes R. Lockshin C. Richman D. McCutchan A. Kennedy C. Oldstone M.B. Nelson J.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1166-1176PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wahren B. Rosen J. Sandstrom E. Mathiesen T. Modrow S. Wigzell H. J. Acquir. Immune. Defic. Syndr. 1989; 2: 448-456PubMed Google Scholar). One recent study systematically characterized the specificity of T-cell clones derived from immunized C57BL/6 mice and then interpreted the results in light of the crystal structure of gp120 (39Surman S. Lockey T.D. Slobod K.S. Jones B. Riberdy J.M. White S.W. Doherty P.C. Hurwitz J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4587-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These authors noted the frequent occurrence of helper T-cell epitopes near exposed strands of gp120 and concluded that the pattern could be related to antigen processing. This conclusion is consistent with our previous work suggesting that structurally disordered regions within protein antigens direct presentation of adjacent sequences by providing preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage (40Landry S.J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 527-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Landry S.J. J. Theor. Biol. 2000; 203: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We propose this mechanism as a theory to complement the well established influence of peptide affinity for MHC class II proteins on helper T-cell epitope immunodominance. To obtain a complete picture of HIV gp120 helper T-cell epitopes, we have mapped immune epitopes in CBA/J and BALB/c mice using splenocyte proliferation in response to overlapping synthetic peptides. The resulting gp120 helper T-cell epitope patterns were then correlated with domain structure and segmental disorder in gp120. Pathogen-free CBA/J (H-2k) and BALB/c (H-2d) female mice 8–12 weeks of age were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Each animal was randomly assigned to an experimental group. The cDNA encoding gp120 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the p89.6 clone provided by Ronald Collman as a template (42Collman R. Balliet J.W. Gregory S.A. Friedman H. Kolson D.L. Nathanson N. Srinivasan A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7517-7521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primer design incorporated restriction enzyme cleavage sites and encoded a C-terminal hexahistidine fusion. The amplification product was cleaved with restriction enzymes BamHI and SphI and ligated into pFastBac-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The nucleotide sequence of clone pFBgp120-2 contained a number of mutations, all of which were silent by comparison with the published sequence (42Collman R. Balliet J.W. Gregory S.A. Friedman H. Kolson D.L. Nathanson N. Srinivasan A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7517-7521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH10Bac cells were transformed with pFBgp120-2 for transposition of the insert into the Bacmid DNA according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc. Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System).Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were transfected with Bacmid DNA using Life Technologies, Inc. Cellfectin. The passage three viral stock was optimized with respect to virus titer and time of infection in High Five cells (Invitrogen) by analysis of gp120 expression using Western blots with IgG from pooled HIV patient sera (James Robinson, Tulane Pediatrics). For protein production, infection was initiated with 0.1 ml of passage three stock/ml of 2 × 106 High Five cells and allowed to proceed at 27 °C for 72 h. The cells were sedimented at 6,000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.4-μm filter and stored at −80 °C. The gp120-containing supernatant from insect cells was made 1% in Triton X-100, and gp120 was purified by affinity for human monoclonal gp120 antibodies A32 and 17B (43Wyatt R. Moore J. Accola M. Desjardin E. Robinson J. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5723-5733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coupled to an Affi-gel Matrix (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Column-bound proteins were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the detergent and then eluted with 3 m MgCl2. The eluted material was concentrated using a Centricon-30 (Amicon), dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot. Forty-four overlapping 20-mer and three 19-mer peptides spanning the entire sequence of HIV gp120 (strain 89.6) were synthesized by Core Laboratory, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (New Orleans, LA). Because it is unclear whether a given cysteine-containing epitope is recognized primarily as the thiol or cysteinylated derivative (44Haque M.A. Hawes J.W. Blum J.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4543-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), all cysteine residues were incorporated as the acetamide derivative. The acetamide derivative represents a compromise in terms of size and polarity, and its inert chemistry favors reproducibility. Mice were intranasally immunized with gp120 in combination with mutant (R192G) heat-labile toxin from enterotoxigenic E. coli (mLT) as an adjuvant (45Cardenas-Freytag L. Cheng E. Mayeux P. Domer J.E. Clements J.D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 826-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each mouse received 10 μl of protein (1 mg/ml) and 10 μl of mLT (0.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline separately. Control mice received the same amount of mLT only. Mice were boosted twice using the same protocol at intervals of 7 days. One week after the second boosting, mice were euthananized with drops of Metofane into noses. A blood sample was obtained immediately via cardiac puncture. The sera were separated by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. The abdominal cavity of each mouse was opened aseptically, and the spleen was removed for lymphocyte isolation by gently teasing against a stainless steel mesh. The cells were treated with red blood cell lysing buffer for 3 min at room temperature and washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium, viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and the number of cells was adjusted to 4 × 106cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 2 μml-glutamine (working medium). The splenocytes were distributed into 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates at 4 × 105 cells/well in RPMI 1640 working medium. Duplicate cultures were stimulated with a single peptide or protein (gp120 or mLT). The cultures were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, labeled with 1.0 μCi of tritiated thymidine/well for another 18 h, and harvested onto glass wool fiber filters using a cell harvester. Tritiated thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA was measured in a liquid scintillation counter, and the values for duplicate cultures were averaged. The result for each peptide in each mouse was expressed as the SI, which is the quotient of counts/min in stimulated wells divided by counts/min in medium control wells. Groups of 10 mice were intranasally immunized with gp120, and the splenocytes from each mouse were stimulated in vitrowith individual overlapping peptides spanning the sequence of gp120 (Table I). Mice whose splenocytes were stimulated with SI > 4 were regarded as having a positive response. No more than one of four CBA/J control mice or one of six BALB/c control mice responded to any peptide with SI > 4. The helper T-cell epitope patterns for gp120 in CBA/J and BALB/c mice were similar but not identical (Fig. 1). The difference in epitope pattern between the mouse strains can be explained by the fact that the two strains have different MHC haplotypes and genetic background.Table IPeptide sequencesPeptideRangeSequence1 30–49KEKTWVTIYYGVPVWREATT2 40–59GVPVWREATTTLFCASDAKA3 50–69TLFCASDAKAYDTEVHNVWA4 60–79YDTEVHNVWATHACVPTDPN5 70–89THACVPTDPNPQEVVLGNVT6 80–99PQEVVLGNVTENFNMWKNNM7 90–109ENFNMWKNNMVDQMHEDIIS8100–119VDQMHEDIISLWDESLKPCV9110–129LWDESLKPCVKLTPLCVTLN10120–139KLTPLCVTLNCTNLNITKNT11130–149CTNLNITKNTTNPTSSSWGM12140–159TNPTSSSWGMMEKGEIKNCS13150–169MEKGEIKNCSFYITTSIRNK14160–179FYITTSIRNKVKKEYALFNR15170–189VKKEYALFNRLDVVPIENTN16180–199LDVVPIENTNNTKYRLISCN17190–209NTKYRLISCNTSVITQACPK18200–219TSVITQACPKVSFQPIPIHY19210–229VSFQPIPIHYCVPAGFAMLK20220–239CVPAGFAMLKCNNKTFNGSG21230–248CNNKTFNGSGPCTNVSTVQ22240–259PCTNVSTVQCTHGIRPVVST23250–269THGIRPVVSTQLLLNGSLAE24260–279QLLLNGSLAEEDIVIRSENF25270–289EDIVIRSENFTDNAKTIIVQ26280–299TDNAKTIIVQLNESVVINCT27290–309LNESVVINCTRPNNNTRRRL28300–319RPNNNTRRRLSIGPGRAFYA29310–329SIGPGRAFYARRNIIGDIRQ30320–339RRNIIGDIRQAHCNISRAKW31330–349AHCNISRAKWNNTLQQIVIK32340–359NNTLQQIVIKLREKFRNKTI33350–368LREKFRNKTIAFNQSSGGD34360–379AFNQSSGGDPEIVMHSFNCG35370–389EIVMHSFNCGGEFFYCNTAQ36380–399GEFFYCNTAQLFNSTWNVTG37390–409LFNSTWNVTGGTNGTEGNDI38400–419GTNGTEGNDIITLQCRIKQI39410–429ITLQCRIKQIINMWQKVGKA40420–439INMWQKVGKAMYAPPITGQI41430–449MYAPPITGQIRCSSNITGLL42440–459RCSSNITGLLLTRDGGNSTE43450–469LTRDGGNSTETETEIFRPGG44460–479TETEIFRPGGGDMRDNWRSE45470–489GDMRDNWRSELYKYKVVRIE46480–499LYKYKVVRIEPIGVAPTRAK47490–508PIGVAPTRAKRRTVQREKR Open table in a new tab A traditional definition of immunodominance based on the number of individuals responding is not adequate for the ranking of 47 peptides using data from only 10 mice. For this work, the immunodominant sequences were assigned as the 10 peptides having the highest average SI within each group of CBA/J or BALB/c mice (TableII). These include all but one peptide (peptide 39 in BALB/c mice) that stimulated a majority of mice in each strain (Fig. 1 and Table II). Therefore, essentially the same peptides were identified whether immunodominance was analyzed by strength or frequency in these two groups of inbred mice.Table IIImmunodominant T-helper sequences of HIV gp120 in miceRankaRanked according to average SI for 10 mice.CBA/JBALB/cPeptidebBold peptide numbers indicate shared or partially overlapped sequences in experiments with CBA/J and BALB/c mice.SIMice w/SI >4PeptidebBold peptide numbers indicate shared or partially overlapped sequences in experiments with CBA/J and BALB/c mice.SIMice w/SI >41179.8926.410268.210286.173476.58325.564306.37385.485385.26225.366194.96304.877324.94144.868294.98464.779334.9544.7410274.78104.75a Ranked according to average SI for 10 mice.b Bold peptide numbers indicate shared or partially overlapped sequences in experiments with CBA/J and BALB/c mice. Open table in a new tab Several gp120 sequences were promiscuously immunodominant. Three immunodominant sequences (corresponding to peptides 30, 32, and 38) were identified in both CBA/J and BALB/c mice, and several additional sequences that were immunodominant in a single strain overlap each other (corresponding to peptides 27–28, 28–29, and 46–47). Some of these sequences substantially overlap immunogenic sequences identified in other studies, which further emphasizes their promiscuity. Sequences corresponding to peptides 27–30 and 38–41 also were identified as epitope “hot spots” in C57BL/6 mice immunized with gp140 (39Surman S. Lockey T.D. Slobod K.S. Jones B. Riberdy J.M. White S.W. Doherty P.C. Hurwitz J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4587-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and sequences corresponding to peptides 28 and 30 were identified as immunogenic in HIV-infected humans (9Schrier R.D. Gnann Jr., J.W. Landes R. Lockshin C. Richman D. McCutchan A. Kennedy C. Oldstone M.B. Nelson J.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1166-1176PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wahren B. Rosen J. Sandstrom E. Mathiesen T. Modrow S. Wigzell H. J. Acquir. Immune. Defic. Syndr. 1989; 2: 448-456PubMed Google Scholar). What structural feature is shared by the promiscuously imunodominant sequences? One possibility is that they contain multiple clustered epitopes that each satisfy different MHC II specificities (36Hale P.M. Cease K.B. Houghten R.A. Ouyang C. Putney S. Javaherian K. Margalit H. Cornette J.L. Spouge J.L. DeLisi C. Berzofsky J.A. Int. Immunol. 1989; 1: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this scenario, we assume that the primary sequence dictates presentation and conclude that the epitope cluster contains two or more sequences that bind well to distinct MHC II. Alternatively, the promiscuously dominant epitopes are more available for presentation because antigen processing preferentially exposes them. In this case, we assume that many sequences bind adequately, but only some sequences are preferentially exposed. Allocation of promiscuously dominant epitopes in gp120 suggests a shared structural feature rather than epitope clustering. All of the promiscuously dominant sequences are in the outer domain identified in the crystal structure by Kwong et al. (Ref. 35Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar; Figs. 2,A and B, and3). The uniquely dominant sequences (corresponding to peptides 6, 17, and 19 in CBA/J and peptides 2, 4, 10, 14, and 22 in BALB/c) are in the inner domain. This distinction is better illustrated in domain-wise correlations of protein structure and immunogenicity discussed below.Figure 3Ribbon diagram of core gp120 (35Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). The locations of hypervariable segments are indicated. (Only the “stems” of the V1/V2 and V3 loops are illustrated. These loops were deleted from the recombinant protein used for the crystal structure.) The outer domain is encircled by an oval. For domain-wise correlations of epitope frequencies and structural parameters, the sequence was divided into segments of 30–250 (light gray) and 250–480 (dark gray), corresponding approximately to the inner and outer domains, respectively. The diagram was prepared using Molscript (58Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) with 1GC1 from the Protein Data Bank and then annotated in Designer (Micrografx). The dashed line indicates the approximate position of the V4 loop, which was not resolved in the crystal structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inspection of the profiles of epitope frequency and crystallographic B-factors suggested that the promiscuous epitopes in the outer domain correlated with segments of local structural disorder. In both BALB/c and CBA/J mice, each of four peaks of epitope frequency in the outer domain overlaps a peak in B-factor (Fig. 2, A and B). Promiscuously immunogenic sequences corresponding to peptides 28–30, 38, 46–47, and 32–38 overlap the disordered segments associated with each of the hypervariable loops, V3, V4, and V5, and a small disordered segment in C3, respectively. Similar patterns of epitopes and corresponding disordered segments have been reported for hen egg lysozyme (40Landry S.J. Immunol.

Form I DNA substrates were constructed with site-specific uracil residues at U·A, U·G, and U·T targets contained within the lacZα gene of M13mp2 DNA. Efficient repair was observed in both DNA polymerase β (+/+) and (−/−) cell-free extracts. Repair was largely dependent on uracil-DNA glycosylase activity because addition of the PBS-2 uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) protein reduced (∼88%) the initial rate of repair in both types of cell-free extracts. In each case, the DNA repair patch size was primarily distributed between 1 and 8 nucleotides in length with 1 nucleotide repair patch constituting ∼20% of the repair events. Addition of p21 peptide or protein to DNA polymerase β (+/+) cell-free extracts increased the frequency of short-patch (1 nucleotide) repair by ∼2-fold. The base substitution reversion frequency associated with uracil-DNA repair of M13mp2op14 (U·T) DNA was determined to be 5.7–7.2 × 10−4 when using DNA polymerase β (+/+) and (−/−) cell-free extracts. In these two cases, the error frequency was very similar, but the mutational spectrum was noticeably different. The presence or absence of Ugi did not dramatically influence either the error rate or mutational specificity. In contrast, the combination of Ugi and p21 protein promoted an increase in the mutation frequency associated with repair of M13mp2 (U·G) DNA. Examination of the mutational spectra generated by a forward mutation assay revealed that errors in DNA repair synthesis occurred predominantly at the position of the U·G target and frequently involved a 1-base deletion or incorporation of dTMP.

To avoid these deleterious effects, the uracil-initiated base excision repair pathway has evolved to remove uracil residues from the genome (2Lindahl T. Wood R.D.

The fundamental chemo-mechanical steps of uracil-mediated BER1 have been described previously in considerable molecular detail (8Parikh S.S. Walcher G. Jones G.D. Slupphaug G. Krokan H.E.

Although these uracil-DNA glycosylases share a common mode of action for cleavage of the N-glycosylic bond linking the uracil base to the deoxyribose phosphate DNA backbone, they differ in substrate specificity. The major uracil-DNA glycosylase activity detected in mammalian cell extracts is UNG (UNG1 and UNG2) (14Domena J.D. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7320-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Domena J.D. Timmer R.T. Dicharry S.A. Mosbaugh D.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). UNG preferentially recognizes uracil residues in single-stranded DNA and is also active on duplex DNA containing U·G mispairs and U·A base pairs (17Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In contrast, human thymine-DNA glycosylase does not recognize uracil in single-stranded DNA but does excise uracil residues in double-stranded DNA with the following specificity: U·G > U·C > U·T ≫ U·A (18Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The human MED1 (also termed MBD4) enzyme acts on U·G mispairs in the context of methylated or unmethylated CpG sites, but activity against uracil-containing single-stranded DNA and U·A, U·C, or U·T double-stranded DNA substrates was not detected (20Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Stoerker J. Genuardi M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32422-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Finally, the single strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase (SMUG1) removes uracil residues preferentially from single-stranded DNA relative to U·G-containing duplex DNA; however, the catalytic efficiency of xSMUG1 compared with UNG for both single- and double-stranded DNA was reduced 10- and 70-fold, respectively (13Haushalter K.A. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The uracil-DNA glycosylases described above can also be differentiated based on their sensitivity to inhibition by the bacteriophage PBS-1 and -2 uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) protein (1Mosbaugh D.W. Bennett S.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 315-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Haushalter K.A. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr.

Ugi acts as a DNA mimic and binds to UNG, forming a stable 1:1 complex that is essentially irreversible under physiological conditions (22Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Sanderson R.J. Slupphaug G. Kavli B.

Biol. 1999; 287: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have revealed an intricate shape, electrostatic and hydrophopic complementarity between the interacting proteins. The observation that Ugi inactivates these biologically distinct enzymes was not surprising because these proteins share 55.7% identical amino acid residues (23Putnam C.D. Shroyer M.J. Lundquist A.J.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, TDG, MED1, and SMUG, which do not share similar amino acid homology with UNG, are insensitive to inhibition by Ugi (13Haushalter K.A. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr.

Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 0007.1-0007.8Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, addition of Ugi to cell-free extracts has been effectively used to investigate Ugi-sensitive and Ugi-insensitive modes of uracil-initiated BER (21Gallinari P. Jiricny J.

Following removal of the uracil base and incision of the ensuant apyrimidinic site, a DNA repair tract is synthesized by DNA polymerase(s) that results in either a short (1 nucleotide) or long (2 or more nucleotides) repair patch (30Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

Short-patch BER of a uracil-containing duplex oligonucleotide (51-mer) has been reconstituted in vitro using the following four purified human enzymes: uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNGΔ84), apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (HAP1), DNA polymerase β (POL β), and DNA ligase I (LIG I) (34Srivastava D.K. Berg B.J.V. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DNA ligase III (LIG III) has been successfully substituted for LIG I in short-patch BER reactions (35Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In the latter case, addition of XRCC1 protein was found to suppress strand displacement DNA synthesis by POL β and promote efficient ligation after the single nucleotide gap-filling reaction that is necessary for short-patch BER (35Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 36Lindahl T. Mutation Res. 2000; 462: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In BER reactions containing plasmid DNA bearing a single AP site and extracts of xrcc1 mutant hamster cells, a partial defect in ligation was detected that disrupted only the short-patch BER pathway (37Cappelli E. Taylor R. Cevasco M. Abbondandolo A. Caldecott K. Frosina G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23970-23975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It is important to indicate that short-patch BER has also been observed in extracts of POL β-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (31Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 38Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hubscher U. Dogliotti E.

Recently, DNA polymerase ι (POL ι) was shown to possess an intrinsic 5′-deoxyribose phosphodiesterase activity similar to that of POL β (40Bebenek K. Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro reconstitution reactions were conducted that showed POL ι can substitute for POL β and can perform complete BER with UNG, HAP1, and LIG I using an oligonucleotide (34-mer) substrate containing either a U·A or U·G target (40Bebenek K. Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A reconstituted enzyme system has also been developed for long-patch BER of a reduced AP site located in a defined oligonucleotide (60-mer) utilizing purified HAP1, POL β, DNase IV (FEN 1), and LIG I (41Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In this system, addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was observed to strongly stimulate the repair reaction and promote strand displacement gap-filling DNA synthesis involving two to six nucleotides (41Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Furthermore, purified POL δ was found to substitute for POL β, providing PCNA was present in the reaction (41Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In extracts of mouse embryonic fibroblast POL β-deficient cells, both short- and long-patch BER were found to be strictly dependent on PCNA (31Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). PCNA-dependent long-patch BER has been also demonstrated in reconstituted systems, where it was shown to be heavily dependent on the circularity of the in vitro BER DNA substrate (30Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

These proteins share a consensus PCNA-binding motif composed of eight amino acids (50Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and bind to the same region of PCNA (51Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr.

Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect of p21 appears to lie in masking the interface required for protein interactions (52Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a p21 peptide (20 amino acids) spanning the C-terminal PCNA-binding motif was found to be sufficient for inhibition of PCNA function in DNA replication and repair (51Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Both the p21 peptide and protein have proved to be useful tools with which to probe the role of PCNA in DNA repair (53Pan Z.Q. Reardon J.T. Li L. Flores-Rozas H. Legerski R. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. J.

Although the biochemical steps of both uracil-initiated short- and long-patch BER pathways have been studied, the fidelity and mutational specificity associated with mammalian BER have not been directly investigated. Whereas in vitro studies to determine the fidelity of the gap-filling DNA synthesis for various purified mammalian DNA polymerases provide useful information (55Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), an assessment of the mutation frequency associated with completed uracil-initiated BER remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we have developed M13mp2 lacZα DNA-based assays to assess the accuracy of uracil-initiated BER using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. We have examined the efficiency, fidelity, mutational specificity, and patch size of uracil-initiated BER in extracts of isogenic POL β-proficient and POL β-deficient cells in the presence and absence of the uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein. In addition, the influence of p21 peptide and protein on the kinetics, patch size, and fidelity of uracil-initiated BER was investigated.

His-tagged p21 was overproduced in E. coli BL21-DE3/pET-Cip1 cells (1.5 liters) according to established protocols (pET Manual, Novagen). Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min, resuspended in 40 ml of sonification buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mg/ml chicken egg white lysozyme (Sigma), and stored at −80 °C. After thawing on ice, cells were subjected to sonification at 0 °C (Branson 450 Sonifier, 1/2-inch horn, 50% duty cycle, 20 pulses), and inclusion bodies containing p21 protein were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min (fraction I). The supernatant fraction was discarded, and the pellet was washed briefly with ice-cold distilled H2O and centrifuged as before. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of denaturing buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea (pH 8.0)) and again subjected to centrifugation.

The hRad9 protein is the human homologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad9, a checkpoint protein required for preventing the onset of mitosis if DNA damage is present or if DNA replication is incomplete. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that hRad9 is a component of the checkpoint response in humans and has possible roles in regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Previous studies indicate that hRad9 is modified by phosphorylation, both in the absence of exogenous stress and in response to various genotoxins. In this study, we report the mapping of several sites of constitutive phosphorylation of hRad9 to (S/T)P X(R/P) sequences near the C terminus of the protein. We also demonstrate that a serine to alanine mutation at residue 272 abrogates an ionizing radiation (IR)-induced phosphorylation of hRad9 and further show that phosphorylation at (S/T)P sites is not a prerequisite for IR-induced phosphorylation of serine 272. Finally, we report that hRad9 undergoes cell cycle-regulated hyper-phosphorylation in G2/M that is enhanced by IR but distinct from that on serine 272. Unlike the IR-induced phosphorylation at serine 272, this event is dependent on serine 277 and threonine 292, two C-terminal (S/T)P sites in hRad9.

Although low frequencies of genetic mutation are tolerated, contributing to genetic diversity, high frequencies are harmful and can lead to cancer (1Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3075-3079PubMed Google Scholar). At the cellular level, eukaryotes have evolved signal transduction pathways called checkpoints to cope with genetic insults (2Hartwell L.H.

Checkpoints stall progression through the cell cycle, providing time for cellular responses such as activation and re-localization of DNA repair enzymes to sites of DNA damage or transcriptional activation of specific genes. Checkpoint arrest can also lead to activation of apoptotic pathways perhaps under conditions when cell death is more beneficial to the organism as a whole than repair (reviewed in Refs. 5Elledge S.J.

In S. pombe,rad9+ is required for the S-phase and G2 checkpoints, which delay the onset of mitosis if DNA replication is incomplete or if DNA damage is present, respectively (3Weinert T.A.

Structural homology between each member of the 9-1-1 complex and PCNA has led to the hypothesis that the 9-1-1 complex replaces replication-associated PCNA-dependent functions during DNA repair (22Caspari T.

During DNA replication, the PCNA homotrimer forms a ring-like sliding clamp over DNA and acts to increase the processivity of DNA polymerase δ (25Bravo R. Frank R. Blundell P.A. Macdonald-Bravo H.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The 9-1-1/PCNA model is supported by the observation that hRad9, hRad1, and hHus1 each interact with hRad17 (27Rauen M. Burtelow M.A. Dufault V.M. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29767-29771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which shares extensive homology to subunits of replication factor C, a protein required for loading PCNA1 onto DNA (reviewed in Ref. 28Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur J Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNA damage induces not only the phosphorylation of hRad9 and hRad1 but also the association of 9-1-1 with chromatin (29Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). From this an attractive model has emerged in which hRad17-dependent loading of 9-1-1 onto DNA at sites of damage could co-ordinate the multifaceted checkpoint response. Although these data suggest that hRad17 and 9-1-1 are early components of the checkpoint-signaling cascade, whether they are responsible for the initial detection of DNA damage still remains unclear. In S. pombe, the Rad3 protein, a phosphatidylinositol-related 3-kinase, phosphorylates Rad26 in response to DNA damage independently of the other checkpoint Rads (30Edwards R.J. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is the initiator of the checkpoint signaling cascade. Two human homologues of Rad3, ATM and ATR, phosphorylate a wide variety of cellular proteins on (S/T)Q sequences in response to DNA damage (31Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K.

Here, we further the current understanding of hRad9 phosphorylation by mapping sites required for its constitutive phosphorylation and by identifying of a novel, cell cycle-regulated, ionizing radiation-induced phosphorylation event. The full-length hRad9 cDNA was subcloned into unique XhoI and XbaI restriction sites of the pyDF31 mammalian expression vector. Protein expression from pyDF31 is driven by the strong constitutive SR α-promoter composed of the SV40 early promoter and a segment of the long terminal repeat of human T-cell leukemia virus (42Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All hRad9 point mutants were generated in pyDF31 using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three selection primers were used to disrupt unique XhoI, NotI, and EagI restriction sites in pyDF31-hRad9. The sequence of these primers and the hRad9 mutagenic primers are shown in TableI. Constructs with multiple point mutations were made by sequential mutagenesis reactions or concurrently by using multiple mutagenic primers in the same reaction. The presence of the desired base substitutions were confirmed by DNA sequencing using an automated sequencer (Cortec DNA Services Laboratory, Kingston, ON and Canadian Molecular Research Services, Ottawa, ON, Canada).Table ISequence of selected oligonucleotides used for hRad9 site-directed mutagenesisOligonucleotideSequence (5′ to 3′)Selection Primer 1GCTCTAGCCCTGGAGATGAAGTGCSelection Primer 2CAAGTAGCGGCCGGTAATTCCTGATTGSelection Primer 3GACAAGTAGCGGCAGGTAATTCCTGATT60AATACCAGGCAGCCGCCCCTGGTCAGGCS160ATGTTCTGCCCTTCGCTCCTGCACTGGCTS277ACAGGACCTGGGCGCCCCAGAGCGTCAT292ACAGGCTCACAGCGCACCCCACCCGGAS328ATCCATTTCCCTTGCACCTGGCCCCCAS336GAGCCCCCCAAGGGCCCCGGTCCCCAT355ACAGTGCCTGGGGCTCCCCCACCCAAS375AGCCCCTGTACGCGCCCCCCAGGGCCCCS380GCCCCAGGGCCCCGGCCCTGTGCTGGCGS272ACCGACTCGCACGCCCAGGACCTGGG Open table in a new tab HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.

The transfection solution was then replaced with DMEM plus 10% FBS, and cells were cultured for an additional 30–48 h before lysis. HeLa cells cultured as described above were synchronized in early S-phase by double thymidine block as previously described (43Fang G., Yu, H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured to a confluence of ∼30% and treated with 2 mm thymidine for 18 h. After 18 h, cells were released from thymidine for 8 h, treated for an additional 18 h, and then released for varying lengths of time. hTERT-RPE1 cells were synchronized in early S-phase using a single, 24-h dose of 5 mm thymidine. Mitotic HeLa cells were generated by treatment with 70 ng/ml demecolcine (Sigma). Synchronized cell populations were followed by flow cytometry; cells were harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and 1% FBS, fixed by the addition of 1 ml of 100% ethanol, and stored at 4 °C for at least 1 h. After fixing, cells were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, 1% FBS, and 0.5 mg/ml RNase A, and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and analyzed using a flow cytometer (Beckman/Coulter EPICS Elite, Mississauga, ON). Cells were lysed in 1 ml of NETN lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1% Triton-X, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.2 mm sodium fluoride. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13000 ×g. Supernatants were pre-cleared by the addition of 15 μl of α-chicken IgY-agarose (Promega, Madison WI) for 30 min at 4 °C before immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 μg of affinity-purified α-hRad9 polyclonal antibodies (Ref. 19St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar; RCH antibodies, Kingston ON) and 15 μl of α-chicken IgY-agarose (Promega) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed four times with 1 ml of cold PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of 0.2 × NE Buffer 3 (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, ON) and 1% SDS. Samples were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min. 20 μl of supernatant was incubated in the presence of 30 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (Roche Diagnostics) in 0.2 × NE Buffer 3 in a final volume of 200 μl for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. HeLa cells were transfected in a 6-well plate as described above. 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed 3× with phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) then incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free DMEM and 10% dialyzed FBS (dialyzed against 150 mm saline to deplete phosphate concentrations). Cells were labeled with 1.25 ml of phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS and 333 μCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were further incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 18 h. Cells were washed 3× with DMEM and 3× with PBS and harvested with a cell scraper. Cells were collected by microcentrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were lysed in 400 μl of NETN buffer containing 0.4 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCl (AEBSF), 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.2 mm NaF. Lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h, then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Soluble cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against hRad9 essentially as described above. Agarose was washed 4× with NETN buffer, resuspended in 60 μl of 2× electrophoresis buffer, and boiled for 5 min before SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide). The gel was either transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antibodies directed against hRad9 or dried using a gel slab dryer (Bio-Rad). Protein quantification of the immunoblot was performed using AlphaEase software and a Chemiimager (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). 32P-quantification was performed using ImageQuant software and a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). All samples were boiled for 5 min before electrophoresis through 8 or 10% acrylamide, as indicated. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) or a wet transfer apparatus (Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, CA). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat milk powder in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated in affinity-purified α-hRad9 polyclonal chicken antibodies at 50 ng/ml in PBS for 1–18 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-chicken secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at a final dilution of 1 in 50,000 for 45 min at 4 °C. Membranes washed and incubated in Western blot chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) before exposure to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The hRad9 protein is constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of DNA damage (19St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and becomes additionally phosphorylated when DNA damage is present (18Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We have observed that under normal cellular conditions (i.e. those where cells are not exposed to exogenous stresses) overexpressed hRad9 consists of four species that differ in migration rate on SDS-PAGE as visualized by immunoblot analysis. The slowest migrating of these species, which we have termed hRad9α, co-migrates with the majority of endogenous hRad9 at an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (Fig. 1 A). In vitrodephosphorylation of exogenous hRad9 causes each of its four migratory forms to collapse into a single band at about 45 kDa, which we have called hRad9δ (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that relative to endogenous hRad9, a large portion of the overexpressed protein is only partially phosphorylated and, hence, has various migratory forms. We have collectively designated all of these partially phosphorylated forms hRad9β. Previous work in our lab has shown that deleting the C terminus of exogenous hRad9 can reduce the number of differentially migrating species from four to one, 2R. P. St.Onge and S. Davey, unpublished results. indicating that the C terminus of hRad9 is required for constitutive phosphorylation of the protein. With this in mind, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acid residues required for the constitutive phosphorylation of hRad9. Potential phosphorylated residues near the C terminus of the protein were converted to non-phosphorylatable amino acids. Mutants were expressed in HeLa cells after transient transfection and screened for migratory shifts as detected by Western analysis. The gross overexpression of protein by the strong SR α-promoter allowed us to distinguish plasmid-derived hRad9 protein from the endogenous protein simply by limiting the exposure time to x-ray film. A trend between those mutants with altered Western blot banding patterns soon emerged, as each of these mutants contained disrupted serine or threonine residues followed immediately by a proline (results summarized in Table II). The (S/T)P motif is the minimum consensus sequence for the cyclin-dependent kinase family of kinases (44Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Tucker J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We therefore mutated all nine (S/T)P sequences in hRad9, immunoprecipitated these proteins from transfected HeLa cells, and compared their banding pattern to the wild type protein (Fig. 1 C). Of the nine (S/T)P mutants, four exhibit changes in hRad9 mobility on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that they are sites of phosphorylation. The S277A and S328A mutants exhibited complete loss of two bands each. The S336G mutation caused an increase in mobility of three of the four bands, whereas the T355A mutation caused a slightly increased mobility in all four of the hRad9α and β forms (Fig. 1 C; upper panel). When dephosphorylated by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, each protein migrated at about 45 kDa (hRad9δ), indicating that the mobility shifts in the upper panel are indeed the result of phosphorylation changes (Fig. 1 C; lower panel). Sequentially introducing these four mutations in combination leads to a reduction in the number of mobility forms and a progressive increase in the mobility of hRad9 (Fig. 1 D). Although the P2A protein (S328A + S336G) migrated as a doublet, P3A (P2A + S277A) migrated as a single band with slightly less mobility than P4A (P3A + T355A). This subtle shift resulting from the T355A mutation is consistent with that observed in Fig. 1 C as well as Figs. 6, A (panel 2) and B. P4A migrated with an approximate molecular mass of 45 kDa (Fig. 1 D), which is only slightly larger than the predicted molecular mass of 42.5 kDa for hRad9.Table IISummary of characterized hRad9 phosphorylation mutants transiently expressed in HeLa cellsAmino acidContextaAmino acids surrounding the residue of interest (indicated in boldface).Immunoblot shiftbImmunoblot mobility shift resulting from phosphorylation at the residue of interest.Serine 380GPSPVLNoSerine 375VRSPQGNoSerine 368FGSILANoSerine 363FRSLEFNoThreonine 355PGTPPPYesThreonine 351PSTVPGNoSerine 350EPSTVPNoSerine 341PHSEEENoSerine 336PKSPGPYesSerine 328SLSPGPYesTyrosine 306DSYMIANoThreonine 292HSTPHPNoSerine 277LGSPERYesSerine 272SHSQDLYes (IR-induced)Serine 160PFSPALNoThreonine 60AATPGQNoa Amino acids surrounding the residue of interest (indicated in boldface).b Immunoblot mobility shift resulting from phosphorylation at the residue of interest. Open table in a new tab The P4A mutant still exhibited a modest mobility shift when treated with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2 A). This suggested the existence of additional sites of constitutive phosphorylation in hRad9. To determine whether these additional sites were (S/T)P sites whose phosphorylation produced little or no shift on a Western blot, we mutated all nine (S/T)P sites in hRad9 in combination. The migration of the P9A mutant (P4A and T60A, S160A, T292A, S375A, and S380G) was not readily distinguishable from that of the P4A mutant and was still sensitive to phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, despite being constitutively phosphorylated on at least four (S/T)P sites, hRad9 is also phosphorylated on sites other than these sequences. We have called the form of hRad9, which completely lacks phosphorylation at (S/T)P sites but still remains phosphorylated, hRad9ε. To further characterize the constitutive phosphorylation of hRad9, HeLa cells were transfected with a series of hRad9 mutants or empty vector and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. The hRad9 point mutants, P3A, P4A, P5A (P4A + T292A), P6A (P5A + S375A), and P9A were used in the transfection, and after metabolic labeling, the hRad9 protein was immunoprecipitated from these cells. Immunoprecipitated protein was size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies directed against hRad9 (Fig. 2 B; left panel). The amount of hRad9 protein recovered from each immunoprecipitation was defined by densitometric analysis of the immunoblot using a Chemiimager and was used for data normalization as described below. A second, identical gel was also run, dried, exposed to a phosphor screen, and analyzed using a STORM PhosphorImager (Fig. 2 B; right panel). In agreement with Fig. 2 A, each hRad9 mutant, including P9A, was significantly phosphorylated, confirming that the hRad9 protein is constitutively phosphorylated at sites other than (S/T)P sites. We went on to quantitate the 32P signal in Fig. 2 B using the ImageQuant software program (Fig. 2 C). Values were normalized to background 32P in each lane and to protein levels (which were all within 15%) determined above by spot densitometry of the hRad9 immunoblot. Because only the P3A mutant was wild type at threonine 355, a site we knew to be constitutively phosphorylated (see Fig. 1), we expected that P3A should have a stronger signal than each of the other four mutants, and it did. The remaining mutants exhibited smaller differences in relative32P activity, which may be a reflection of confounding variables inherent to the experiment, such as protein normalization, rather than legitimate differences in phosphorylation. ATM and ATR, two serine/threonine DNA damage-responsive kinases that likely function in the same biochemical pathway as hRad9, have been demonstrated to phosphorylate target proteins at serine/threonine-glutamine ((S/T)Q) sequences (33Kim S.T.

In this report, a novel target of MK2 has been identified, the ETS transcription factor family member ER81, whose dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis and whose normal function is required during development. MK2 phosphorylates ER81 in vitro within its central inhibitory domain, and overexpression of MK2 leads to increased in vivo phosphorylation of ER81. Two serine residues, ER81 amino acids 191 and 216, were identified as MK2 phosphorylation sites. MK2 suppresses basal ER81-dependent transcription, and this suppressive effect is alleviated upon mutation of the MK2 phosphorylation sites in a cell type-specific manner. However, MK2 can also interfere with ER81-mediated transcription independently of serine 191 and serine 216 phosphorylation. Furthermore, MK2 overexpression counteracts the stimulation of ER81 activity by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Altogether, MK2 may regulate ER81 transcriptional activity in a cell type-specific manner and thereby modulate various physiological processes beyond stress responses.

Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). A plethora of stimuli, including serum, growth factors, cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α, UV light, hyperosmolarity, and heat, trigger intracellular signal transduction pathways that lead to the activation of one or more of these MAP kinase classes. Upon activation, MAP kinases functionally regulate many proteins through serine/threonine phosphorylation, including distinct MAPKAP kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and modulate downstream effectors. In particular, MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2) is stimulated by signals such as heat shock and tumor necrosis factor-α via the p38-MAP kinase pathway (2Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M.

Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, lack of MK2 activity severely dampens tumor necrosis factor-α biosynthesis, causing resistance to lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock (4Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 5-lipoxygenase, which catalyzes important steps in the synthesis of a group of inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes, is a downstream target of MK2 (5Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), suggesting that MK2 may affect the inflammatory response at different levels. A variety of other proteins are phosphorylated by MK2, implicating the involvement of MK2 in many different physiological processes dependent on these target proteins. Among those are the small heat shock proteins (6Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), the F-actin-binding lymphocyte-specific protein 1 (7Huang C.K. Zhan L. Ai Y. Jongstra J. J. Biol.

Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene regulation mediated by ER81 is dependent on its N- and C-terminal transactivation domains, which may be modulated by a central inhibitory region. In addition, transcriptional activity of ER81 can be stimulated by ERK-MAP kinases (12Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Analysis of mouse embryos revealed a spatially and temporally controlled ER81 expression pattern, suggesting that ER81 may serve important functions during development (13Chotteau-Lelievre A. Desbiens X. Pelczar H. Defossez P.A. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 937-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Also, knock-out ER81 mice display severe motor discoordination because of the improper establishment of nerve connections in the developing spinal cord (14Arber S. Ladle D.R. Lin J.H. Frank E. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Furthermore,ER81 overexpression may contribute to the development of breast cancer, and a chromosomal translocation involving the ER81 and EWS genes results in the generation of Ewing's sarcoma (15Baert J.L.

By phosphorylating ER81 on two serine residues, MK2 can inhibit ER81 transcriptional activity in a cell type-specific fashion. Furthermore, MK2 may additionally interfere with ER81-mediated transcription in a manner independent of ER81 phosphorylation by MK2. The cells grown on 6-cm dishes were transfected with HA- or Myc-tagged protein kinase expression vectors. 36 h after transfection, the cells were washed with 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. The cells were lysed for 5 min with 600 μl of 1× Frackelton buffer (10 mm Tris, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.1) supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. After scraping of the dishes, the cell lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml tube, vortexed for 15 s, and then tumbled for 45 min. Debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 20800 × g), and the supernatant was incubated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Repligen) for 45 min with continuous tumbling. After centrifugation (5 min, 20800 × g), 1 μl of appropriate mouse monoclonal antibody (α-HA, 12CA5; α-Myc, 9E10) was added to the supernatant, and 2 h later 25 μl of protein A-agarose bead slurry was added followed by another hour of tumbling. The beads were recovered by centrifugation (1 min, 960 × g) and then washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. This was followed by two washes in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP). Finally, the beads were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer, of which 5 μl were utilized for in vitro kinase reactions. Typically, these were performed in a volume of 15 μl with 0.2–2 μg of substrate and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The incubation time was 20 min at 30 °C, after which the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Transiently transfected 293T cells were lysed in 0.25× Frackelton buffer supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. Further processing was as described above, except that protein A-agarose beads were washed four times in lysis buffer and then taken up in 25 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Also, a small aliquot of lysate (1–3%) was collected before the addition of the antibody to utilize it as an input control. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting was performed utilizing mouse monoclonal α-HA (12CA5) or α-Myc (9E10) antibodies. Finally, blots were developed with goat α-mouse antibodies or protein G coupled to horseradish peroxidase employing chemiluminescence. Transiently transfected cells grown on 6-cm dishes were labeled with 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h. Then cells were washed twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1× Frackelton buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Immunoprecipitations were performed with α-Myc (9E10) antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mink lung Mv1Lu or rabbit kidney RK13 cells seeded in 6-cm dishes and grown to 30% confluency were transiently transfected with 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and other mammalian expression vectors as indicated. 36 h after transfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined as described (17Bredemeier-Ernst I. Nordheim A. Janknecht R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ETS transcription factor ER81 has been shown to be phosphorylated by ERK-MAP kinases within amino acids 63–182 that are part of an N-terminal transactivation domain (12Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To exclude that other regions of ER81 (Fig. 1 A) become phosphorylated by any of the three MAP kinase classes, different GST-ER81 fusion proteins were employed in in vitro kinase assays utilizing immunoprecipitated ERK1, JNK1, or p38-2 (Fig. 1 B). ERK1, when stimulated by the constitutively active Raf-1 kinase BXB (18Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), efficiently phosphorylated GST-ER8163–182, but it phosphorylated none of the other GST-ER81 fusion proteins. Likewise, JNK1, when activated by a constitutively active MEK kinase, MEKKc (19Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), phosphorylated only GST-ER8163–182 to a significant degree. On the other hand, p38-2, which on its own was always activated to some degree, was apparently able to phosphorylate both GST-ER8163–182 and GST-ER81182–334 (Fig. 1 B). As expected, phosphorylation of GST-ER8163–182 by p38-2 was further enhanced by MEK6(DD), a constitutively active activator of p38-2 (20Stein B. Yang M.X. Young D.B. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Murray B.W. Barbosa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19509-19517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In stark contrast, phosphorylation of GST-ER81182–334 was reduced upon coexpression of p38-2 and MEK6(DD), suggesting that GST-ER81182–334 was not directly phosphorylated by p38-2 but most likely by a p38-2-associated protein kinase whose activity in the p38-2 immunoprecipitate is reduced upon MEK6(DD) expression. Often, protein kinases can stably interact with their substrates. Thus, the above postulated p38-2-associated protein kinase might be a MAPKAP kinase that is phosphorylated and thereby activated by p38-2. A MAPKAP kinase that is thought to be a downstream target of p38-MAP kinases, but not of ERK- or JNK-MAP kinases, is MK2 (2Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was tested whether MK2 specifically interacted with p38-2. Myc-tagged MK2 and HA-tagged ERK1, JNK1, or p38-2 were coexpressed in 293T cells, and α-HA immunoprecipitations were performed. The presence of coimmunoprecipitated MK2 was then assessed by α-Myc Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). MK2 coimmunoprecipitated only with p38-2. A reverse order coimmunoprecipitation assay, α-Myc immunoprecipitation followed by α-HA Western blotting revealed the same in vivointeraction of MK2 with p38-2 (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, coexpression of MEK6(DD) suppressed the interaction of p38-2 with MK2 (Fig. 2 B), which offers an explanation for the conundrum of why phosphorylation of GST-ER81182–334 by a p38-2 immunoprecipitate, which should also contain the p38-2-associated MK2 protein, is reduced upon MEK6(DD) coexpression. These results implied that the p38-2-associating MK2 phosphorylates ER81 within amino acids 182–334. To test this hypothesis, GST-ER81 fusion proteins were employed as substrates in in vitro kinase assays with MK2. Indeed, MK2 specifically phosphorylated GST-ER81182–334 but phosphorylated none of the other GST-ER81 fusion proteins (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, ER81 was metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in Mv1Lu cells in the presence or absence of coexpressed MK2. As shown in Fig. 3 B (left panel), the degree of in vivoER81 phosphorylation was increased more than 4-fold upon MK2 expression. A control Western blot revealed comparable levels of ER81 protein being expressed in the presence and absence of MK2, indicating that altered ER81 protein levels were not responsible for the increased level of phosphorylation observed (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Thus, MK2 can phosphorylate ER81 in vitro and, most likely, in vivo. Next, the effect of MK2 on ER81 transcriptional activity was assessed with a luciferase reporter driven by the TORU sequence, which is activated upon ER81 DNA binding (21Monte D. Coutte L. Baert J.L. Angeli I. Stehelin D. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 771-779PubMed Google Scholar). ER81 activated the TORU-luc reporter more than 9-fold in Mv1Lu cells, and this activation was dramatically reduced upon MK2 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). This reduction in transactivation was not due to grossly altered ER81 protein levels, because they were comparable in the presence and absence of MK2 (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to Mv1Lu cells, MK2 did not dramatically suppress ER81-dependent transcription in RK13 cells; at most, transcriptional activation was reduced to 50% (Fig. 4 C). Again, ER81 protein levels were basically unaffected by MK2 overexpression in RK13 cells (Fig. 4 D). In conclusion, MK2 can suppress ER81-dependent transcription strongly in Mv1Lu cells and weakly in RK13 cells. However, it remains unresolved whether this suppression of ER81-dependent transcription requires the direct phosphorylation of ER81 by MK2, a question that can be answered upon identification and mutation of respective phosphorylation sites in ER81. As a first step to identify the MK2 phosphorylation sites in ER81, phosphopeptide analyses were performed on ER81 amino acids 182–334 that are specifically targeted by MK2 as shown above. Thus, GST-ER81182–334 was phosphorylated with MK2 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the32P-labeled GST-ER81182–334 protein was eluted from the gel and then digested with trypsin, and the resulting phosphopeptides were separated in two dimensions on thin layer chromatography plates as described (22van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Three prominent phosphopeptides were observed (Fig. 5 A, bottom panel), indicating that more than one MK2 phosphorylation site may exist. Please note that because of incomplete trypsin digestion, contamination with chymotrypsin, or incomplete oxidation of methionine and cysteine residues, the number of phosphorylation sites is often less than the number of phosphopeptides observed. Full-length, Myc-tagged ER81 was also isolated from transiently transfected, 32P metabolically labeled 293T cells, and its tryptic phosphopeptide pattern was determined (Fig. 5 A,top panel); five prominent phosphopeptides were observable, three of which comigrated with the peptides phosphorylated by MK2 in vitro (Fig. 5 A, middle panel). These results indicate that MK2 phosphorylates ER81 at amino acids that are in vivo phosphorylation sites. Recently, it has been shown that phosphopeptides a–c (Fig. 5 A) correspond to in vivo phosphorylation of ER81 at serine residues 191 and 216 (23Papoutsopoulou S. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7300-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consistently, although mutation of either serine 191 or serine 216 to alanine did not abolish phosphorylation of GST-ER81182–334 by MK2, mutation of both serine residues did (Fig. 5 B). Collectively, these data indicate that MK2 phosphorylates ER81 on serine 191 and serine 216. To prevent phosphorylation at serine 191 and serine 216, these phosphoacceptor sites were mutated to alanine. Respective ER81 mutants were then compared in their transcriptional activity to the wild-type ER81 molecule. As shown in Fig. 6 A and reported previously (23Papoutsopoulou S. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7300-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the S191A, S216A, and S191A/S216A mutants activated the TORU-luc reporter ∼2.5-fold more than the wild-type ER81 molecule in Mv1Lu cells; this is not due to higher amounts of the mutant proteins, because they were comparably expressed as the wild-type ER81 protein (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that phosphorylation of ER81 by endogenous MK2 (or a related protein kinase) on either serine 191 or serine 216 inhibits its basal transcriptional activity. Overexpression of MK2 reduced transcriptional activity in all cases by more than 2-fold (Fig. 6 A), but the mutants remained considerably more active than the wild-type ER81 protein. These data suggest that MK2 can suppress ER81-dependent transcription via two mechanisms: one involving the phosphorylation of serine 191 and serine 216 and one that is independent of phosphorylation on these residues. Next, the ER81 mutants were also tested in RK13 cells (Fig. 6,C and D). Surprisingly, they did not behave differently from the wild-type ER81 molecule in the presence or absence of MK2. As shown already in Fig. 4 C, MK2 overexpression also had little effect on ER81 transcriptional activity in comparison with Mv1Lu cells. Thus, ER81 activity appears to be cell type-specifically regulated by MK2. ER81 has been shown to be activated upon ERK-MAP kinase stimulation (12Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, it was tested whether phosphorylation of serines 191 and 216 affects induction of ER81 activity by ERK-MAP kinases. Whereas wild-type ER81 and the S191A/S216A mutant displayed a ∼2.5-fold difference in transcriptional activity in the absence of BXB, a constitutive active activator of ERK-MAP kinases (18Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), transcriptional activities were the same in the presence of BXB in Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 7 A). In addition, expression of MK2 only slightly affected BXB-triggered activation of ER81 and its S191A/S216A mutant. Interestingly, MK2 significantly reduced BXB-triggered transcription in the absence of ER81 (Fig. 7 A,Vector), suggesting that an endogenous ETS factor(s) mediating this induction is affected by MK2. ER81 is also a target of p38-MAP kinases. 2Bosc, D., Goueli, B., and Janknecht, R., (2001)Oncogene, in press. Therefore, p38-2-induced transcriptional activation of ER81 was also investigated. Whereas wild-type ER81 was ∼3-fold activated by p38-2, S191A/S216A transcriptional activity was raised by only approximately half in Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 7 A). As a consequence of this different degree of activation by p38-2, the transcriptional activity of wild-type ER81 approached the same elevated level as the S191A/S216A mutant, contrasting their ∼2.5-fold difference in activity in the absence of p38-2. However, MK2 overexpression re-established the difference in transcriptional activity between wild-type and S191A/S216A ER81 by repressing wild-type ER81 more than the S191A/S216A mutant. Thus, ERK- and p38-MAP kinase-mediated activation of ER81 is differentially affected by MK2 expression. Similar experiments with BXB, p38-2, and ER81 were performed in RK13 cells (Fig. 7 B). Wild-type ER81 and the S191A/S216A mutant behaved similarly under all circumstances. In addition, MK2 overexpression had no effect on BXB-induced ER81 activity, whereas p38-2-mediated induction of ER81 was ∼3-fold suppressed by MK2. In this report, it has been shown that MK2 can phosphorylate ER81 on two serine residues (amino acids 191 and 216) in vitroand in vivo. Analysis of the ER81 amino acid sequence surrounding serine 191 and serine 216 (FRRQLS191 and YQRQMS216) reveals that both of these two serines match the MK2 consensus site, a serine preceded by an arginine at position −3 and by a bulky hydrophobic residue at position −5 (24Stokoe D. Caudwell B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Both serine 191 and serine 216 are localized within the central inhibitory domain of ER81 encompassing amino acids 182–249 (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that MK2 phosphorylation may modulate the function of this inhibitory domain. Indeed, mutation of serines 191 and 216 to alanine enhanced the basal transcriptional activity of ER81 in Mv1Lu cells, indicating that phosphorylation at these sites may suppress ER81 function. However, this differential activity of wild-type and S191A/S216A ER81 was not observed in RK13 cells. What could cause this cell type-specific behavior? One reason might be that phosphorylation of serine 191 or serine 216 is required for the recruitment of a corepressor, which is cell type-specifically expressed. Another potential explanation could be that the inhibitory domain of ER81 is masked and thereby functionally obstructed by an ER81-binding protein(s) in RK13 but not Mv1Lu cells. MK2 expression also led to strong (Mv1Lu cells) or weak (RK13 cells) transcriptional down-regulation of the S191A, S216A, and S191A/S216A mutants, indicating that MK2 operates via another pathway not involving serine 191 or serine 216 phosphorylation. Potentially, this could entail phosphorylation of ER81 by MK2 at another site. However, this appears to be unlikely because MK2 phosphorylates in vitroexclusively serines 191 and 216 in ER81 (Figs. 3 A and5 B). Rather, MK2 might modulate a cofactor, either inhibiting its transactivation function or precluding its interaction with ER81, or sequester endogenous p38-MAP kinase (see below), whose intrinsic basal activity may therefore no longer contribute to the low level of basal phosphorylation and thus activation of ER81. Upon stimulation of ERK-MAP kinases with BXB or upon overexpression of p38-2-MAP kinase, wild-type ER81 and the S191A/S216A mutant had the same transcriptional activity even in Mv1Lu cells. These data indicate that the inhibitory effect of endogenous MK2 in Mv1Lu cells can be overridden upon MAP kinase stimulation. Presumably, this involves direct phosphorylation of ER81 by MAP kinases, leading to a stimulation of its transactivation potential. Overexpression of MK2 counteracted the stimulation of wild-type ER81 and the S191A/S216A mutant by p38-2 in both Mv1Lu and RK13 cells. One reason for this may be the sequestration of p38-MAP kinases by MK2. Several experimental data support such a hypothesis: (i) MK2 was shown to coimmunoprecipitate with p38, which is consistent with two other reports describing an interaction between these two protein kinases (25Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 26Rane M.J. Coxon P.Y. Powell D.W. Webster R. Klein J.B. Pierce W. Ping P. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3517-3523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Interestingly, other protein kinases may be associated with the MK2-p38 complex. For instance, MK2 and p38 are in a complex with the protein kinase Akt before and after stimulation of human neutrophils, allowing the phosphorylation of Akt by MK2 (26Rane M.J. Coxon P.Y. Powell D.W. Webster R. Klein J.B. Pierce W. Ping P. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3517-3523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Yet, this complex formation may be cell type-specific, because Akt activation appears not to be mediated by MK2 in 293 cells upon IFG-1 stimulation or in Swiss 3T3 cells upon stimulation with various stressors (27Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar, 28Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, MK2, potentially in conjunction with other proteins, can form a complex with p38-MAP kinases, a prerequisite for sequestration. (ii) Whereas the classical ERK-MAP kinases predominantly reside in the cytoplasm before stimulation and in part translocate to the nucleus after stimulation (29Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4380) Google Scholar), p38-MAP kinases are predominantly nuclear in unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation, this intracellular localization has been reported to remain unchanged, or cytoplasmic accumulation of p38 has been observed in different cell lines (25Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 30Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J.

Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic accumulation is dependent on a limiting factor, which has been identified as MK2 (25Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), indicating that MK2, which upon phosphorylation by p38 is indeed exported from the cell nucleus (25Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 32Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), coexports p38-MAP kinase. Accordingly, coexpression of p38-2, which is active to some degree even without stimulation (20Stein B. Yang M.X. Young D.B. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Murray B.W. Barbosa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19509-19517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), with MK2 leads to the phosphorylation of MK2 by p38-2, nuclear coexport of p38-2 and consequently to a reduced activation of the nuclear ER81 protein by p38-2. Because MK2 does not interact with ERK-MAP kinases, MK2 overexpression suppresses barely, if at all, ER81 activity induced by the specific upstream activator of ERK-MAP kinases, BXB. In addition to ER81, other transcription factors have been shown to be phosphorylated by MK2: the MADS box protein serum response factor (8Heidenreich O. Neininger A. Schratt G. Zinck R.

Serum response factor is pivotal for the regulation of the immediate-early gene c-fosand is phosphorylated in vivo on serine residue 103, which increases its DNA binding activity. Several protein kinases have been implicated in serine 103 phosphorylation, including casein kinase II, the growth factor-inducible kinase p90rsk, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and MK2 (8Heidenreich O.

However, hitherto it has not been demonstrated that phosphorylation of serine 103 has any impact on transcription mediated by the serum response factor. Similar to ER81, MK2 expression has been demonstrated to inhibit the activity of E47 (34Neufeld B. Grosse-Wilde A. Hoffmeyer A. Jordan B.W. Chen P. Dinev D. Ludwig S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20239-20242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, MK2 phosphorylation sites have not been determined, and it remains to be resolved whether MK2 inhibition of E47 is due to direct phosphorylation of E47. In contrast, the transcription factor CREB is activated upon MK2 phosphorylation on serine 133 (9Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar,10Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is also the phosphorylation site for cAMP-activated protein kinase A. This indicates that MK2 may exert either positive or negative effects on transcription factors. Altogether, MK2 may regulate ER81-dependent transcription in a manner dependent as well as independent of serine 191 and serine 216 phosphorylation. Thereby, MK2 may ensure that ER81 and its target genes are repressed in unstimulated cells, and it may attenuate the p38-MAP kinase-mediated stimulation of ER81. Because ER81 is involved in many developmental processes (13Chotteau-Lelievre A. Desbiens X. Pelczar H. Defossez P.A. de Launoit Y.

Nature. 2000; 405: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) are just a few recent examples where results from different techniques are integrated in a description at the atomic level of the energy-transducing events. The phenomenon of energy transduction relies on coupled events (5Williams R.J.P. J. Solid State Chem. 1999; 145: 488-495Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whether they involve only electrostatic interactions or structural rearrangements of the active sites or its surroundings (mechano-chemical coupling), which may be more important than the electrostatic component of the overall coupling (6Louro, R. O., Catarino, T., LeGall, J., Turner, D. L., and Xavier, A. V. (2001) ChemBioChem, in press.Google Scholar). The pumping of proton(s) at the beginning of re-reduction of cytochrome c oxidase (7Verkhovsky M.I. Jasaitis A. Verkhovskaya M.L. Morgan J.E. Wikstrom M. Nature. 1999; 400: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) can be described using a model in which the electrostatic attraction of electrons and protons is overcome (8Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268, Suppl. 1 (PLL-7): iiGoogle Scholar), a situation that requires structural changes involving charged residues. Small proteins capable of performing energy transduction provide easier access to the structural bases for the underlying mechanisms, as the recent advances in the understanding of the proton pumping by the 26-kDa bacteriorhodopsin demonstrate (1Luecke H. Schobert B. Richter H.-T. Cartailler J.-P. Lanyi J.K. Science. 1999; 286: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 9Subramaniam S. Henderson R.

This work reports the conformational changes underlying the positive cooperativity between redox centers (homotropic) and between redox and acid-base centers (heterotropic) observed in a 14-kDa tetraheme cytochrome c3 isolated from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 (Ddc3).1 The analysis integrates data derived from the microscopic thermodynamic characterization of the hemes and acid-base centers (6Louro, R. O., Catarino, T., LeGall, J., Turner, D. L., and Xavier, A. V. (2001) ChemBioChem, in press.Google Scholar), the structures obtained by x-ray crystallography in the oxidized and reduced states, and theoretical studies based on these structures. These data provide a coherent description of the mechanism that enables the efficient coupling of the transfer of two electrons with protons in the physiological pH range. The thermodynamically coupled transfer of electrons and protons observed in the soluble cytochromes c3 has been termed “proton-thrusting” because it parallels the linkage between redox- and proton-transfer mechanisms of larger, membrane-embedded protein complexes involved in proton pumping (10Louro R.O. Catarino T. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 488-491Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Crystals of the oxidized form of D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 cytochrome c3 were obtained as previously described (11Morais J. Palma P.N. Frazao C. Caldeira J. LeGall J. Moura I. Moura J.J. Carrondo M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12830-12841Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At pH 4.0, Ddc3 crystallizes in hexagonal space group P6122, with cell parameters a = b = 62.71 Å, c = 111.09 Å at room temperature and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. These crystals were first transferred to another solution at higher pH containing polyethylene glycol 400 60% (v/v) and 0.05 mTris/HCl buffer at pH 7.6. An excess of sodium dithionite was then added to the drop, and a gradual color change in the crystals was observed. After approximately 3 h, the crystal color became uniform and similar to that observed for the reduced protein in solution, which was taken as an indication of a successful reduction. This procedure was necessary for two reasons: first, all attempts at crystallizing Ddc3 from a reduced protein solution were unsuccessful; and second, use of sodium dithionite as a reducing agent requires alkaline pH values to avoid degradation with formation of bisulfite. Diffraction data from flash-frozen crystals of both the oxidized and reduced forms of Ddc3 at pH 7.6 were collected in-house at 110 K on an imaging plate detector (MAR 300-mm scanner) using graphite-monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (λ 1.5418 Å) from a Nonius FR-571 rotating anode generator operating at 45 kV and 99 mA. The diffraction images were processed with the HKL program suite (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276A: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) to extract diffraction intensities; conversion of intensities into structure factors was carried out within the CCP4 (13Project N.C.C.

Dauter Z. Carrondo M.A. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1998; 273: 213-224Crossref Google Scholar) in the crystal structures of the oxidized and reduced forms at 110 K and pH 7.6 was carried out by the molecular replacement method with the program AmoRe (15Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using data up to 3.5-Å resolution. Clear solutions were obtained for both forms, with correlation coefficients of 69.8 and 68.8%, and R-factors of 33.0 and 34.2%, respectively. The reflection data set of the oxidized form was then split into a test set (504 reflections, i.e. a random sample containing ∼6% of the 7877 measured independent reflections), used to calculate Rfree, and a working set, comprising the remaining 7373 reflections, used in the structure refinement. The reflection data set of the reduced form was likewise split into a (different) test set (544 reflections, i.e. a random sample containing ∼6% of the 8507 measured independent reflections), and a (different) working set containing the remaining 7963 reflections used in the structure refinement. The refinement of both redox forms was carried out with X-PLOR beginning with a simulated annealing refinement at 3,000 K using the standard protocol. Fourier 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ and ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ maps were calculated at the end of each refinement run and inspected on a workstation using TURBO (16Roussel A. Cambilau C. Turbo-Frodo in Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, Canada1989: 77-78Google Scholar). Some side-chain positions were corrected and, at a later stage, individual thermal motion parameters were refined and water molecules and SO42− ions included in the model. In the final stages of refinement it was realized that the SO42− ion sites were partially occupied, because all atoms had a B-factor much higher than the refined overall B for the whole model. Also, side-chain 2-fold disorder models were included for a few protein residues as well as the propionate A of heme I (in both redox forms). The final R-values obtained were 0.189 and 0.179 for the oxidized and reduced forms, respectively, and the corresponding values of Rfree were 0.240 and 0.205, respectively.

MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and both molecules had stereochemical quality parameters within their respective confidence intervals. In the ϕ,φ plots for the non-proline and non-glycine residues (not shown) only Cys-51 in both molecules lies outside the normally allowed regions, as previously discussed (14Simões P. Matias P.M. Morais J. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Carrondo M.A. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1998; 273: 213-224Crossref Google Scholar). Overall, 88.0% of the non-proline and non-glycine residues for the reduced form (82.6% for the oxidized form) lie within the most favored regions. The ϕ,φ plots for proline and glycine residues (not shown) indicate that only Pro-21 in both molecules adopts a conformation slightly outside the most favored regions. There is some missing electron density in the surface loop containing Gly-72, particularly for Glu-73, possibly because of loop flexibility. As a consequence, this loop conformation is poorly defined. Overall, the refined model for the reduced form seems to be better than the refined model of the oxidized form. This may result in large measure from the better quality of the diffraction data obtained from the former (see Table I). The modeling methodology used here has been previously described in detail (18Baptista A.M. Martel P.J. Soares C.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2978-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It consists of the calculation of free energy terms using finite-difference continuum electrostatics (19Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), followed by the sampling of redox and protonation states using a Monte Carlo method. The continuum electrostatic calculations were done with the program MEAD (20Bashford D. Gerwert K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), using an ionic strength of 0.1 m, a temperature of 300 K, a molecular surface defined with a solvent probe radius of 1.4 Å, and a Stern (ion exclusion) layer of 2.0 Å. A two-step focusing procedure (21Gilson M.K. Sharp K.A. Honig B. J. Comp. Chem. 1987; 9: 327-335Crossref Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) was used, with consecutive grid spacings of 1.0 and 0.25 Å. The dielectric constants of the solvent and protein were respectively 80 and 15. The Monte Carlo calculations were done with the program MCRP (18Baptista A.M. Martel P.J. Soares C.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2978-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The temperature was 300 K, and pairs of sites were selected for double moves when their direct interaction exceeded 2 p Kaunits; each Monte Carlo run consisted of 50,000 steps. Calculations were performed in the oxidized and reduced structures, by considering them in all possible states, depending on the values of pH and reduction potential. This means that non-natural situations were simulated, for instance, the fully oxidized structure was simulated at reduction potential values corresponding to fully reduced situations. This is a necessity here, given that it is not known at which values of reduction potential the structural redox transitions occur. The collective interpretation of the results is presented in Fig. 5. The redox and acid-base properties of Ddc3, reported in the literature (6Louro, R. O., Catarino, T., LeGall, J., Turner, D. L., and Xavier, A. V. (2001) ChemBioChem, in press.Google Scholar), show that the reduction potentials of the four hemes are pH-dependent, a phenomenon termed the redox-Bohr effect (22Papa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 456: 39-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Louro R.O. Catarino T. Salgueiro C.A. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 34-38Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and that this dependence involves two distinct p Ka values in the range 4.5–8.7. The two acid-base transitions were fit with p Kaox = 4.6 and 5.0, and pKared = 7.6 and 7.1, respectively. Fig. 1 reports the oxidized fractions for each of the hemes versus solution potential at pH 6 derived from the thermodynamic data (6Louro, R. O., Catarino, T., LeGall, J., Turner, D. L., and Xavier, A. V. (2001) ChemBioChem, in press.Google Scholar). Hemes I and II titrate together and more steeply than Nernst curves calculated using a value of n equal to 1. This is a consequence of the network of interactions between the centers and the similarity of the reduction potentials of these two hemes, which, assisted by a favorable redox-Bohr effect, results in an overall positive cooperativity favoring a coordinated two-electron step. This overall positive cooperativity will be referred to as a proton-assisted two-electron step. Fig. 2 shows the dominant microscopic populations involved in the first two macroscopic steps of oxidation at pH 6, determined from the thermodynamic data and discriminated according to their protonation state. The macroscopic steps are defined as the transition between the different redox stages of the protein, each of which comprises all microscopic populations with the same number of oxidized hemes (24Turner D.L. Salgueiro C.A. Catarino T. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The figure clearly shows that, when oxidation stage 2 is reached (two of the hemes are oxidized), the dominant microscopic population is that with the acid-base center located close to heme I deprotonated. This selectivity for particular microscopic populations is an important feature for the efficiency of energy transduction (25Krab K. Wikstrom M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Blair D.F. Gelles J. Chan I.S. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 713-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), because it ensures that the majority of the molecules are in the same state, thus able to react in a consistent manner with the specific redox partners upstream and downstream in the redox chain. Selection for particular microstates can be considered directional in the sense that certain groups in the protein structure are specifically used, avoiding short-circuiting through nonspecific reactions. This may result from selective evolutionary pressure that favors the interactions of particular active groups with the physiological partners (27Salgueiro C.A. Costa P.N. Turner D.L. Messias A.C. vanDongen W.M.A.M. Saraiva L.M. Xavier A.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9709-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The crystals obtained for the oxidized and reduced states of the protein at pH 7.6 (see “Structure Determination and Refinement” under “Materials and Methods”) yielded broadly similar structures. It must be noted that at pH 7.6 the structures are expected to represent the fully deprotonated oxidized state (p Kaox = 4.6 and 5.0), and a partially protonated condition in the reduced state (pKared = 7.6 and 7.1). Thus, to assess the changes linked only to reduction, the structure models of both redox states were also compared with the structure of the oxidized state at pH 4.0 previously reported (14Simões P. Matias P.M. Morais J. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Carrondo M.A. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1998; 273: 213-224Crossref Google Scholar). The models of both redox states at pH 7.6 were superimposed with X-PLOR (28Brunger A.T. X-PLOR–A System for Crystallography and NMR Version 3.0. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the main-chain and heme ring atoms. The overall r.m.s. values obtained for this fit are 0.39 Å for main-chain, 1.26 Å for side-chain, and 0.20 Å for heme ring atoms. However, for the analysis of the localized differences, the electron density was regarded as an important factor in deciding which of the observed changes were real and which were likely to be artifacts caused by poor definition of side chains due to positional disorder in some of the surface residues. Three main areas in the structure show a clear difference between the oxidized and reduced states of Ddc3: the side chains of Glu-26 and Lys-27, Propionate A of heme I, and the neighborhood of heme II. Because these were all regions where the structural models of the oxidized states (at pH 4.0 and 7.6) were in agreement, it seems reasonable to consider that the differences observed in the reduced state do indeed result from the reduction of Ddc3 rather than deprotonation. In both structures of the oxidized state the Glu-26 Oε1 forms a hydrogen bond with Lys-27 Nζ, whereas its Oε2 is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule. In the reduced state, Glu-26 has a different side-chain rotamer, there is no hydrogen bond to Lys-27, and Oε1 is now hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule. At pH 7.6, propionate A of heme I in the oxidized state is 2-fold disordered, with one of the conformers identical to the only one observed in the oxidized state at pH 4.0, which is protonated. In the reduced state at pH 7.6, this group is also 2-fold disordered, but both conformers are different from any of those obtained in the structures of the oxidized state. Interestingly, one of the oxygen atoms (O1A) in conformer 2 of the reduced state establishes a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-43 (2.94 Å), indicating that a proton is located between these two atoms. Fig.3 represents the region around Heme I in the reduced and oxidized states at pH 7.6. Propionate D of heme II, Glu-61, Lys-75, and His-76 are compared in Fig. 4for the oxidized and reduced states at pH 7.6. In the structure of the reduced state, the side chain of Glu-61 is nearly perpendicular to the heme plane, although not interacting with it, and establishes a hydrogen bond with Lys-75 Nζ. By contrast, the Glu-61 side chain in the oxidized states is nearly parallel to the heme plane and the hydrogen bond observed in the reduced state is absent. Furthermore, the associated electron densities are poorly defined in both structures of the oxidized state, suggesting that the side chain of the Lys-75 is flexible. In the oxidized and reduced states at pH 7.6, the Nε2 atom of His-76 is oriented toward both oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group in Propionate D of heme II. However, some differences are observed, with the Nε2 atom of His-76 in the oxidized state closer to O1D (2.73 Å) than O2D (3.56 Å), although the presumed hydrogen bond has an atypical geometry (angle N–H … O close to 90°). In contrast, at pH 4.0 its distance is too long to form a significant hydrogen bond with either O1D or O2D (3.38 and 3.23 Å, respectively). This structural rearrangement may be explained considering that both groups are protonated, with rapid exchange of the propionate proton between O1D and O2D. In the reduced state, a clear hydrogen bond is observed between His-76 Nε2 and O2D(2.72 Å). In the structure of the oxidized state at pH 4.0, the Nδ1 atom of His-76 is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule (OW 264, 2.77 Å). However, this water molecule is absent in the oxidized state at pH 7.6, but is again clearly observed in the reduced state at pH 7.6 (OW 384, 2.68 Å). This result suggests that, at pH 7.6, His-76 Nδ1 has lost its proton in the oxidized state but regained it upon reduction of the cytochrome, possibly as a consequence of the redox-Bohr effect. To identify the specific residues that may participate in the redox-Bohr effect, theoretical calculations based on the x-ray structures in the oxidized and reduced states were performed to determine the proton and electron populations at different values of pH and reduction potential for different groups. These calculations give titration profiles that deviate from a Henderson-Hasselbalch curve and the midpoint titration of all protonatable groups (p Ka1/2) in the fully oxidized and fully reduced states can be estimated from these data (Fig. 5). The calculations show that the groups with substantial modifications in their predicted p Ka values between the two structures, and with either p Kaox, pKared, or both, in the range from pH 6 to 8, are as follows: the propionates of heme I, propionate A of heme II, propionate D of heme IV, and His-76. The N terminus is the only other residue predicted to titrate in this pH range, but the change of its p Ka values is negligible. The roles of propionate D of heme I and the free His (when it is present) seem to be a consistent feature over several Desulfovibrio species (18Baptista A.M. Martel P.J. Soares C.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2978-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Martel P. Soares C.M. Baptista A.M. Fuxreiter M. Náray-Szabó G. Louro R.O. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Soares C.M. Martel P.J. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 714-727Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the oxidized structure there are no indications that either of the propionates of heme I is protonated at pH 7 in any of the possible conformers. In contrast, there is clear evidence in the reduced structure that at least one proton is bound to these groups, both from the crystallographic as well as from the theoretical point of view. If conformer 1 of propionate A is considered, the calculations show that propionate D contains a proton at pH 7, given that its p Ka1/2 is around this value (black square in Fig. 5). If conformer 2 of propionate A is considered, the calculations show that this same propionate has a proton, given that its p Ka1/2 is above 7 (black diamond in Fig. 5). The crystallographic evidence referred to in Fig. 4 also points to the presence of such a proton, which is shared with the carbonyl group of Tyr-43. Fig. 4 reveals that Glu-61 has a very large redox-linked conformational modification. This residue is located close to hemes I and II and is expected to be charged in the physiological pH range as reported in Fig. 5. The observed movement of its negatively charged carboxylate side chain away from heme II is consistent with the observed enhancement of the electron affinity of heme II upon reduction. The continuum electrostatic calculations of the electron binding curves using the coordinates of the oxidized and reduced structures confirm this effect (Fig.6). The curves corresponding to the reduced and oxidized structures cannot hold simultaneously, because a transition between the two structures necessarily occurs as oxidation proceeds. Thus, if this transition takes place within the region where heme II titrates, the actual titration curve will follow the dotted curve in the fully reduced region and gradually shift to the solid curve as oxidation proceeds (Fig. 6). This shift leads to a steeper function, characteristic of positive cooperativity. To show that the conformational change occurring in Glu-61 (whose potential effect has previously been calculated (29Martel P. Soares C.M. Baptista A.M. Fuxreiter M. Náray-Szabó G. Louro R.O. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) is that responsible for this positive cooperativity, three mutants were modeled. The plot identified as “E61A” in Fig. 6 contains the calculated data of the mutation of Glu-61 and shows that the change into Ala destroys this positive cooperativity, resulting in a flatter curve, indicating a slight negative cooperativity. To investigate the origin of this negative cooperativity two other mutants were modeled. The mutation of Lys-62 to Ala (plot identified as “K62A” in Fig. 6) retains the positive cooperativity, but the double mutant of Glu-61 and Lys-62 into Ala (plot identified as “E61A-K62A” in Fig.6) generates a situation where no significant cooperativity is observed (almost superimposable curves for the oxidized and reduced structures), indicating that Lys-62 was the main cause of the negative cooperativity. Thus, the redox-linked structural changes associated with the side chain of Glu-61 make a fundamental contribution to the positive cooperativity observed for the titrations of hemes I and II in the thermodynamic data, even though the str"

Mutations in the gene encoding choline acetyltransferase (cha-1) and in the gene encoding VAChT (unc-17) lead to similar behavioral defects, and both mutations protect against the toxicity of organophosphorus compounds such as aldicarb. Aldicarb inhibits the degradative enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing the toxic accumulation of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. These mutations confer resistance to esterase inhibition by reducing the efficiency of acetylcholine neurosecretion. One difference in phenotype between mutants in the two genes is that choline acetyltransferase mutants have decreased levels of acetylcholine within cholinergic nerve terminals, whereas VAChT mutants have increased levels of acetylcholine within cholinergic nerve terminals (5Hosono R. Sassa T. Kuno S. Zool. Sci. 1989; 6: 697-702Google Scholar, 6Nguyen M. Alfonso A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Genetics. 1995; 140: 527-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the increased acetylcholine level in CeVAChT mutants is not available for synaptic release due to specific defects in the level of expression or in the intrinsic activity of VAChT. Vesicular acetylcholine transport is essential for cholinergic neurotransmission because homozygous VAChT knockout mutants in C. elegans and in Drosophila melanogaster do not live for more than a few days (3Alfonso A. Grundahl K. Duerr J.S. Han H.-P. Rand J.B. Science. 1993; 261: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 7Kitamoto R. Xie X. Wu C.F. Salvaterra P.M. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Genetic manipulation of the level of VAChT expression can influence acetylcholine synaptic release. In Drosophila, VAChT heterozygotes show decreased cholinergic transmission with high frequency stimulation (7Kitamoto R. Xie X. Wu C.F. Salvaterra P.M. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of VAChT in Xenopus embryos increases the magnitude of postsynaptic currents at developing neuromuscular junctions by 2- to 3-fold (8Song H. Ming G. Fon E. Bellocchio E. Edwards R.H. Poo M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the increase in vesicular packaging of acetylcholine observed in vitro after overexpression of VAChT in cholinergic cells (9Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol.

Thus, the level of VAChT expression may alter the rate and extent of synaptic vesicle accumulation of acetylcholine. Relatively little is known regarding the role of the intrinsic activity of VAChT on the vesicular accumulation and synaptic release of acetylcholine.

Sequence conservation of the aspartic acid residues within the putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) of VAChT from several species suggests functional importance in intrinsic activity. Some of these aspartate residues have been shown to be critical for the activity of VAChT (16Kim M.-H. Lu M. Kelly M. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6175-6180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-H. Chai Y.-H. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When an aspartate residue is changed in TMD IV (D193N) or in TMD X (D398N), overexpression of rat VAChT in Xenopusneuromuscular junctions no longer leads to an increase in quantal acetylcholine secretion (8Song H. Ming G. Fon E. Bellocchio E. Edwards R.H. Poo M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of D398N appears to result in a dominant negative effect that reduces endogenous quantal acetylcholine secretion (8Song H. Ming G. Fon E. Bellocchio E. Edwards R.H. Poo M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In vesicles isolated from PC-12 cells, the D398N mutation completely abolishes acetylcholine transport and vesamicol binding, whereas the D193N mutant transports acetylcholine at the same rate as wild-type transporter (16Kim M.-H. Lu M. Kelly M. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6175-6180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). VAChT is part of a gene family that includes the vesicular monoamine transporters VMAT1 and VMAT2 (18Eiden L.E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2227-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The functional activity of vacht relies upon the proton electrochemical gradient established by a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (9Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27229-27232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Nguyen M.L. Cox G.D. Parson S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13400-13410Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A chimeric VAChT molecule in which TMD I is replaced by TMD I of VMAT2 shows a reduced affinity for acetylcholine but retains vesamicol binding (20Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This suggests that TMD I of VAChT, like the TMD I of VMAT, is involved in substrate translocation (21Merickel A. Rosandich P. Peter D. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the ammonium headgroup of acetylcholine may interact with Asp-425 in TMD XI instead of Asp-46 in TMD I, which is hypothesized to interact with the primary amino group of monoamines (16Kim M.-H. Lu M. Kelly M. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6175-6180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Merickel A. Rosandich P. Peter D. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The roles of conserved basic amino acid residues within the TMDs of VAChT have also been examined by mutagenesis. A putative charge-pair interaction between His-338 in TMD VIII and Asp-398 in TMD X has been proposed to anchor the TMD helices together (17Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-H. Chai Y.-H. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The presence of a salt bridge in membrane-spanning regions of VAChT may be important in facilitating the conformational changes associated with H+/acetylcholine antiport. In VMATs, the negative charge in TMD X is hypothesized to play a direct role in H+ translocation (22Steiner-Mordoch S. Shirvan A. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13048-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A conserved lysine residue in TMD II (Lys-131) is also critical for VMAT and VAChT function (17Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-H. Chai Y.-H. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,23Merickel A. Kaback H.R. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5403-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, Lys-131, His-338, and Asp-398 play important roles in the mechanism of action of VAChT, possibly as components of a H+ relay system, as described for VMATs and the lactose permease, a H+-symporter that belongs to the same sequence-defined superfamily (22Steiner-Mordoch S.

In the present report, we have analyzed 12 different nonlethal point mutations in the CeVAChT in an effort to identify additional domains of VAChT involved in acetylcholine translocation. Several mutations are at residues that are conserved in vertebrate VAChTs and are associated with normal levels of VAChT protein in cholinergic nerve endings. These mutant proteins also exhibit appropriate targeting to synaptic vesicles. The analysis of the acetylcholine transport and vesamicol binding properties of hVAChT constructs containing these mutations expressed in a heterologous system in vitroprovides new information regarding the location of the acetylcholine transport recognition site in VAChT. Furthermore, the combination of a genetic approach in C. elegans and biochemistry in vitro establishes a direct relationship between the intrinsic parameters of vesicular acetylcholine transport in vitro and the storage and synaptic release of acetylcholine in vivo. C. elegansstrains were grown on solid medium as described previously (3Alfonso A. Grundahl K. Duerr J.S. Han H.-P. Rand J.B. Science. 1993; 261: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 28Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unc-17 alleles md65 and md69 were ethyl methane sulfonate-induced and identified by noncomplementation with pre-existing unc-17 mutations (3Alfonso A. Grundahl K. Duerr J.S. Han H.-P. Rand J.B. Science. 1993; 261: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar); md334,md414, and md1107 were isolated as spontaneous mutants resistant to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb (6Nguyen M. Alfonso A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Genetics. 1995; 140: 527-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12593-12598Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Alleles with p designations were ethyl methane sulfonate-induced (in Richard Russell's laboratory) and isolated by resistance to aldicarb (30Rand J.B. Russell R.L. Psychopharmacol. Bull. 1985; 21: 623-630PubMed Google Scholar). The unc-17 alleles with e allele designations were isolated at the Medical Research Council (Cambridge, United Kingdom) and generously provided by Jonathan Hodgkin. All mutants were outcrossed to wild-type (N2 Bristol) at least four times. The sequence alterations associated with the e245 and p1160 alleles have been published previously (3Alfonso A. Grundahl K. Duerr J.S. Han H.-P. Rand J.B. Science. 1993; 261: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the remaining unc-17 mutations involved amplification of specific 1–2-kilobase unc-17 genomic regions using direct “single-worm polymerase chain reaction” from individual mutant animals (31Williams B.D. Schrank B. Huynh C. Shownkeen R. Waterston R.H. Genetics. 1992; 131: 609-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by sequencing of the amplified genomic DNA with internal primers. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Nematodes were prepared with a variation of the “freeze-crack” method and stained with an anti-CeVAChT mouse monoclonal antibody (Mab 1403) as described previously (32Albertson D.G. Dev. Biol. 1984; 101: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 33Duerr J.S. Gaskin J. Rand J.B. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1616-C1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lickteig K.M. Duerr J.S. Frisby D.L. Hall D.H. Rand J.B. Miller III., D.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All behavioral measurements were performed at 20 °C. The procedures for observing and quantifying pharyngeal pumping and body thrashing in liquid have been described previously (29Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 72-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Values are normalized to N2 = 100% and are presented ± S.D. (10–50 individuals were counted for each allele). An approximate measure of growth rate at 20 °C was determined by a “plate-clearing” method (36Rand J.B. Johnson C.D. Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. C. elegans: Modern Biological Analysis of an Organism. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 187-204Google Scholar). Twenty L1 animals were placed on a streak plate and examined once or twice a day, until all the food was consumed. A total of one to four plates were analyzed per allele. The growth rate for each strain is defined as the inverse of the number of days to consume all the food, and the “relative growth rate” is calculated as ratio of the mutant growth rate to the wild-type rate. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a 640-base pair Sse8387I/SalI fragment of hVAChT (contains coding sequences that include TMD IV through TMD X) subcloned into pUC18 using the method of Deng and Nickoloff (37Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coliBMH 71-18 mutS bacterial strain and buffers were provided with the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH). Transformants were screened by cDNA double-stranded sequencing using the Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical). The mutated hVAChT fragment was then reintroduced into the wild-type hVAChT cDNA and subcloned into pRc/CMV at HindIII/NotI for transfection into PC-12 cells. Rat PC-12 cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum, 7% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm glutamine. PC-12 cells were transfected with the hVAChT constructs using Lipofectin (10 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.), and stable transformants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). Geneticin-resistant colonies were picked and screened by immunocytochemistry as described previously (38Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9094-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed for 2 h in 10% formalin/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with species-specific hVAChT antipeptide rabbit polyclonal antisera (39Weihe E. Tao-Chemg J. Schäfer M.K.-H. Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3547-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) at a final dilution of 1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton, and 3% normal goat serum. Primary antibodies were visualized using VectaStain Kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Control PC-12 cells and the lines expressing hVAChT and the hVAChT mutants were grown to confluence in a T175 flask, treated with 6 mm sodium butyrate, and incubated for an additional 36 h. This treatment increases expression from viral promoters (40Grote E. Hao J. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and does not affect the biochemical parameters of acetylcholine transport or targeting of VAChT to cholinergic vesicles in PC-12 cells. Transient transfections were also performed in CV-1 fibroblasts by the T7-vaccinia hybrid system as described previously (11Varoqui H. Diebler M.-F. Meunier F.-M. Rand J.B. Usdin T.B. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Erickson J.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, collected in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. To prepare postnuclear supernatants, the cell pellets were resuspended and homogenized in a ball-bearing device (20 strokes, 11 μm clearance) in ice-cold buffer containing 80 mm potassium tartrate, 20 mmHEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm ascorbic acid, adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH, and supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mg/ml pepstatin) and 50 μm esterase inhibitor echothiophate (Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories). The nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. The protein content in the supernatant was measured using the Bradford assay (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 73: 248-254Crossref Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). The levels of expression of the human VAChT proteins were assessed on Western blot and, when possible, by [3H]vesamicol (l-[piperidinyl-3,4-3H]vesamicol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) binding measurements. Fresh preparations were used to perform [3H]acetylcholine transport assays. For [3H]acetylcholine uptake assay, aliquots (100 μl) of postnuclear homogenates containing 200 μg of protein were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence and absence ofl-vesamicol (Research Biochemicals Inc.) as described previously (42Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Amara S.G. Methods in Enzymology: Neurotransmitter Transporters. Academic Press, New York1998: 84-98Google Scholar). After preincubation, 100 μl of uptake buffer containing 110 mm potassium tartrate, 20 mmHEPES, 1 mm ascorbic acid, 50 μmechothiophate, and 10 mm Mg2+-ATP (neutralized with KOH to pH 7.4) and various concentrations of tritiated (0.4 mm; 55.2 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and unlabeled acetylcholine were added. The final concentration of Mg2+-ATP was 5 mm. Uptake was terminated after 10 min by placing tubes in an ice water bath, filtering through GF/C glass fiber filters (Whatman), and washing with 5 ml of ice-cold uptake buffer. Homogenates from control PC-12 cells and human VAChT-expressing PC-12 cells were always analyzed in parallel to assess the specific acetylcholine uptake derived from endogenous PC-12 VAChT, which is generally less than 2-fold more than that seen at 4 °C or in the presence of 2 μm vesamicol. Aliquots of postnuclear supernatant (30 μg of protein in 50 μl) were mixed with binding buffer containing 110 mm potassium tartrate and 20 mmHEPES at pH 7.4 (50 μl) and various concentrations of [3H]vesamicol (31 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For acetylcholine displacement of [3H]vesamicol binding, the organelles in the postnuclear homogenates were first lysed by dilution (1:10) in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES containing peptidase inhibitors and centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The pellets were resuspended in binding buffer, and [3H]vesamicol (final concentration, 20 nm) and various amounts of unlabeled acetylcholine were added. After a 30-min incubation at 20 °C, the reactions were stopped by vacuum filtration through GF/C glass fiber filters (Whatman) presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine, followed by a 5-ml wash with ice-cold buffer containing 110 mm potassium tartrate and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. Radioactivity bound to the filters was solubilized in 1 ml of 1% SDS and measured by scintillation counting in 10 ml of EcoScint (National Diagnostics). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 30 μml-vesamicol and subtracted from the total binding. For equilibrium density fractionation, postnuclear supernatants (about 1 mg of protein) were loaded onto a continuous 4.4 ml of 0.6–1.6 m (20–46%) sucrose gradient buffered with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, and 5 mm EGTA for sedimentation at 46,000 rpm at 4 °C for 3 h in a SW55 rotor. For glycerol velocity fractionation, we used a modification of the method described by Kelly and co-workers (40Grote E. Hao J. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant (about 1 mg of protein) was loaded onto a 4.4-ml 5–25% glycerol gradient prepared in homogenization buffer for a 45-min centrifugation at 55,000 rpm in a SW55 rotor. For both gradients, a first fraction equivalent to the volume loaded and successive 350-μl fractions were collected from the top. The linearity of the gradients was verified by refractometry. Equivalent amounts of protein from the postnuclear supernatants of the stable PC-12 lines expressing hVAChT and the hVAChT mutants or equal volumes of each gradient fraction were processed for Western blot analysis. High-speed pellets were prepared from diluted gradient fractions. Sucrose gradient fractions were brought to 320 mm sucrose with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, whereas glycerol gradient fractions were diluted 5-fold in the same buffer. Both were spun for 1 h at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Ti50.4 rotor. Pellets were solubilized in sample buffer containing 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, and 50 mmdithiothreitol. Membrane proteins were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chromogranin B and synaptophysin (p38) were detected in aliquots taken directly from gradient fractions and dissolved in sample buffer. After a 1-h preincubation in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, the blots were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with affinity-purified anti-hVAChT at 1 mg/ml (38Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9094-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), anti-chromogranin B at 1:1000 (a gift from R. Fischer-Colbrie, Innsbruck, Austria), or anti-p38 at 1:5000 (Sigma) in TBS-1% bovine serum albumin. Bound primary antibodies were visualized using a monoclonal anti-rabbit antibody or a polyclonal anti-mouse antibody, both of which were coupled to peroxidase (Sigma), and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequence alterations of 19 independent unc-17 point mutants, corresponding to 12 distinct amino acid substitutions, are presented in Fig.1. These fall predominantly into three categories: (a) those at amino acids that are conserved among VMATs and VAChT, (b) those found only in VAChTs, and (c) those unique to CeVAChT. Only one mutation (CeR60W) was found at a residue unique to CeVAChT; it was localized in the first intralumenal loop. Six mutants (CeE98K, CeG103R, CeG103E,CeG342E, CeG347R, and CeY400N) had sequence alterations at amino acid residues that are conserved in VMATs and VAChT. Five of these mutations lie in predicted TMDs (TMDs II, IX, and XI), whereas one (CeE98K) is in the luminal loop between TMD I and TMD II. The CeG103R/E, CeG342E, and CeG347R mutations introduce a charged residue into the putative TMDs. Four CeVAChT mutations (CeA206V,CeC230F, CeT292del, and CeC370Y) were at amino acids that are relatively conserved in Torpedo, rat, and human VAChT but are not conserved in VMATs. Three of these VAChT-specific residues introduce a larger and more hydrophobic amino acid residue in predicted TMDs (TMDs V, VI, and X), and one (CeT292del) was found in the luminal loop between TMD VII and VIII. One mutation (CeS211F) is at an amino acid conserved in VMATs, whereas this residue in vertebrate VAChTs is glycine (G233). C. elegans mutants were screened for normal levels of CeVAChT immunoreactivity. Mutations at two locations (CeG342E and CeG347R) led to lower levels of CeVAChT protein. These mutations altered residues conserved in VAChTs and VMATs, and they probably destabilized the VAChT protein. All of the VAChT-specific mutations as well as CeS211F express relatively normal amounts of protein that is appropriately targeted to cholinergic endings (Fig.2). We measured three phenotypes of the unc-17 mutants (Fig.3). The rates of pharyngeal pumping and thrashing in liquid are measures of neuromuscular function in the pharynx and the body muscles, respectively. The “plate clearing” assay is affected by both the generation time and the fecundity of the mutants. By each of these criteria, e327(CeS211F), e795 (CeA206V), and p1160 (CeC230F) form a graded series of increasing severity, whereas md414 (CeC370Y) homozygotes have approximately normal growth and only moderately impaired neuromuscular function. For comparison, the properties of the unc-17 reference allele e245 (CeG347R) are also presented in Fig. 3. However, because e245 has lower levels of VAChT immunoreactivity in vivo (Fig. 2), it is difficult to compare the e245 phenotypic data directly to the other mutants. We have further examined the effect of these mutations on VAChT function in a heterologous system that has been used to study the vesicular trafficking and transport function of mammalian VAChT (9Varoqui H.

https://openalex.org/W1967134204,"The quenching of the YD· tyrosyl radical in photosystem II by nitric oxide was reported to result from the formation of a weak tyrosyl radical-nitric oxide complex (Petrouleas, V., and Diner, B. A. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta1015, 131–140). This radical/radical reaction is expected to generate an electron spin resonance (ESR)-silent 3-nitrosocyclohexadienone species that can reversibly regenerate the tyrosyl radical and nitric oxide or undergo rearrangement to form 3-nitrosotyrosine. It has been proposed that 3-nitrosotyrosine can be oxidized by one electron to form the tyrosine iminoxyl radical (>C=N-O⋅). This proposal was put forth as a result of ESR detection of the iminoxyl radical intermediate when photosystem II was exposed to nitric oxide (Sanakis, Y., Goussias, C., Mason, R. P., and Petrouleas, V. (1997) Biochemistry36, 1411–1417). A similar iminoxyl radical was detected in prostaglandin H synthase-2 (Gunther, M. R., Hsi, L. C., Curtis, J. F., Gierse, J. K., Marnett, L. J., Eling, T. E., and Mason, R. P. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, 17086–17090). Although the iminoxyl radicals detected in the photosystem II and prostaglandin H synthase-2 systems strongly suggest a mechanism involving 3-nitrosotyrosine, the iminoxyl radical ESR spectrum was not unequivocally identified as originating from tyrosine. We report here the detection of the non-proteinl-tyrosine iminoxyl radical generated by two methods: 1) peroxidase oxidation of synthetic 3-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine and 2) peroxidase oxidation of free l-tyrosine in the presence of nitric oxide. A newly developed ESR technique that uses immobilized enzyme was used to perform the ESR experiments. Analysis of the high resolution ESR spectrum of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical generated from free tyrosine and nitric oxide reveals a 28.4-G isotropic nitrogen hyperfine coupling and a 2.2-G proton hyperfine coupling assigned to the proton originally ortho to the phenoxyl oxygen.

J., Eling, T. E., and Mason, R. P. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, 17086–17090). Although the iminoxyl radicals detected in the photosystem II and prostaglandin H synthase-2 systems strongly suggest a mechanism involving 3-nitrosotyrosine, the iminoxyl radical ESR spectrum was not unequivocally identified as originating from tyrosine. We report here the detection of the non-proteinl-tyrosine iminoxyl radical generated by two methods: 1) peroxidase oxidation of synthetic 3-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine and 2) peroxidase oxidation of free l-tyrosine in the presence of nitric oxide. A newly developed ESR technique that uses immobilized enzyme was used to perform the ESR experiments. Analysis of the high resolution ESR spectrum of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical generated from free tyrosine and nitric oxide reveals a 28.4-G isotropic nitrogen hyperfine coupling and a 2.2-G proton hyperfine coupling assigned to the proton originally ortho to the phenoxyl oxygen. electron spin resonance 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid horseradish peroxidase immobilized HRP 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl horseradish peroxidase-compound I horseradish peroxidase-compound II Protein-derived radicals play an important role in enzymatic catalysis (1Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9179-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The reaction of a tyrosyl radical cofactor with nitric oxide has been shown to inhibit enzyme activity. When photosystem II is exposed to NO, the stable tyrosyl radical cofactor YD· is reversibly quenched (13Petrouleas V. Diner B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 131-140Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, NO reversibly quenches the redox-active YZ· in manganese-depleted photosystem II and the S3 state (an exchange-coupled complex involving YZ·) in acetate-treated photosystem II (14Szalai V.A. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15080-15087Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When ribonucleotide reductase is exposed to NO, enzymatic activity is diminished; in addition the tyrosyl radical cofactor that resides on the R2 subunit is reversibly quenched (15Lepoivre M. Fieschi F. Coves J. Thelander L. Fontecave M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 16Lepoivre M. Chenais B. Yapo A. Lemaire G. Thelander L.

These studies with photosystem II and ribonucleotide reductase provide important insights into the reactivity of the tyrosyl radical and NO but provide little information regarding the nature of the tyrosyl radical/NO interaction. Exposure of photosystem II to NO followed by illumination at 200 K results in the quenching of the tyrosyl radical and the formation of an additional radical species that was assigned by ESR1 as the tyrosine iminoxyl radical (>C=N-O⋅) based on the large nitrogen hyperfine-coupling constant (Aiso = 29.3 G) (18Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When prostaglandin H synthase-2 is exposed to NO, the tyrosyl radical associated with enzymatic turnover is eliminated, and an additional radical species, similar to the one seen during the NO exposure/illumination in photosystem II, is detected. This radical is also assigned to the tyrosine iminoxyl radical (19Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

The observation of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical species in photosystem II and prostaglandin H synthase-2 prompted the proposal of SchemeFS1. The reaction between tyrosyl radical (Scheme FS1, A) and NO is near diffusion limited (1–2 × 109m−1 s−1) (21Eiserich J.P. Butler J. Van der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); a major product is expected to be the ESR-silent 3-nitrosocyclohexadienone species (SchemeFS1, B). A prototropic rearrangement of B results in the formation of 3-nitrosotyrosine (Scheme FS1, C), which is in equilibrium with its oxime tautomer, C′. The one-electron oxidation of C or C′ results in the formation of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical (Scheme FS1, D). The source of the oxidative equivalent needed to convertC/C′ to D in the enzyme systems is not clear, although it has been proposed that C/C′ is oxidized by the light-driven reactions in photosystem II (18Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and by the peroxidase activity in prostaglandin H synthase-2 (19Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C.

The one-electron oxidation of the iminoxyl radical has been proposed to form 3-nitrotyrosine (19Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17086-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have continued the investigation of the tyrosyl radical and NO chemistry depicted in Scheme FS1. Although the ESR spectra of the iminoxyl radicals detected in photosystem II and prostaglandin H synthase-2 strongly support the chemistry in Scheme FS1, the ESR spectra are from polycrystalline samples with broad ESR linewidths and display a single hyperfine coupling from the iminoxyl nitrogen. The nitrogen hyperfine parameters are identified as originating from the nitrogen of NO. However, no tyrosine-derived nuclei are identified; thus the iminoxyl radical was not unequivocally identified as originating from tyrosine. In this study, we report the ESR detection of the protein-free l-tyrosine iminoxyl radical generated by two methods: 1) peroxidase oxidation of synthetic 3-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine and 2) peroxidase oxidation of free l-tyrosine in the presence of NO. The immobilized (77 K) ESR spectrum of theN-acetyl-l-tyrosine iminoxyl radical was nearly identical to the iminoxyl radical detected in photosystem II and prostaglandin H synthase-2. The reactivity of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical with the antioxidant ascorbate was also investigated. l-Tyrosine,N-acetyl-l-tyrosine, ascorbic acid, sodium nitrite, MOPS, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and glycine ethyl ester were purchased from Sigma and were used as received. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride, sodium amminepentacyanoferrate (II) hydrate, andN-acetyl-l-tyrosine used in the synthesis of 3-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine were purchased from Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) type VI-A was purchased from Sigma. Hydrogen peroxide was purchased from Fischer Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA); concentrations were verified using the UV absorbance at 240 nm (ε = 43.6 cm−1m−1). Tyrosine isotopes,l-4-hydroxyphenyl-3,5-d2-alanine, referred to in this study as 3,5-d2-l-tyrosine, andl-4-hydroxyphenyl-2,6-d2-alanine, referred in this study as 2,6-d2-l-tyrosine, were purchased from Isotec Inc. (Miamisburg, OH) and used as received. NO (99% minimum, CP grade) was purchased from National Specialty Gases (Durham, NC). The preparation of NO solutions was carried out in a certified fume hood. Spent NO solutions were allowed to air oxidize within the fume hood or reacted with a molar excess solution of potassium permanganate prior to disposal (22Beckman J.S. Wink D.A. Crow J.P. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 61-70Google Scholar). Affi-Gel 10 and Chelex-100 were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (Hercules, CA). Enzyme dialysis was done using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes, andM r 10,000 cutoff was purchased from Pierce. Sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate and sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate were purchased from Mallinckrodt (Paris, KY). All buffers were made fresh daily from a 10-fold concentrate that underwent a 24-h Chelex-100 treatment; DTPA was added to the buffer concentrate after removal of Chelex-100. Final buffer concentrations (50 mm phosphate and 50 μm DTPA) were obtained by dilution with HPLC water followed by pH adjustment to 7.4. The synthesis of 3-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine was adapted from a synthesis of nitrosophenols by Maruyama et al. (23Maruyama K. Tanimoto I. Goto R. J. Org. Chem. 1967; 32: 2516-2520Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar).N-Acetyl-l-tyrosine (1 G, 4.5 mmol) was dissolved in 20 ml of water; 1.6 G (23 mmol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 0.82 G (3 mmol) of sodium amminepentacyanoferrate (II) hydrate were added while stirring. Stirring was continued while 2 ml (18 mmol) of 30% H2O2 was added dropwise over a period of 5–10 min. The mixture was stirred for 1 h, and the product was isolated by reversed phase (C-18) low pressure chromatography. A step gradient (100 ml portions of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, MeOH in 5% steps) was used to elute the product from the column. The product eluted in 15% MeOH. The product was not stable, and attempts to further purify it were unsuccessful. 1H NMR (CD3OD) d 7.33 (d,J = 9 Hz, 4-CH), 6.88 (br s, 2-CH), 6.83 (dd,J = 9 and 1.5 Hz), 4.73 (dd, J = 5 and 9 Hz, a-CH), 3.18 (dd, J = 5 and 14 Hz, b-CH), 2.93 (dd, J = 9 and 14 Hz, b-CH) and 1.92 (s, COCH3); MS (TOF, ES+) 253 (M+H). Experiments using 3-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine were done immediately following the preparation. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) type VI-A was dialyzed against a 0.1 m MOPS buffer (pH 7.5) for 6 h with one change of buffer. HRP was recovered from the dialysis cassette and coupled to an activated agarose gel bead support (Affi-Gel 10) via the primary amino group as outlined in the product literature. A subscript “i” will be used to denote the immobilized enzyme (i.e.immobilized horseradish peroxidase = HRPi). The use of immobilized enzymes for the direct ESR detection of enzyme-generated radicals was developed and evaluated in our laboratory. 2Sturgeon, B. E., Chen Y.-R., and Mason, R. P., manuscript in preparation. The HRPi (∼100 μl) was transferred into a 10-mm quartz flat cell and then washed with buffer. A small glass wool plug in the outlet side of the flat cell prevented the loss of HRPi during flow conditions. The activity of the HRPi was based on the milligrams of enzyme bound per bed volume of agarose gel bead support. The concentration of the enzyme solution prior to agarose bead exposure was compared with the concentration after exposure to determine the milligrams of enzyme immobilized. Free enzyme concentration was assayed using the visible absorbance at 402 nm (ε = 102 mm−1 cm−1) (24Schonbaum G.R. Lo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The average milligrams/bead bed volume was 7.5 mg/ml. The quoted HRP activity is ∼1300 units/mg based on the 2,2′-azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid] (ABTS) assay. The resulting HRPi activity/flat cell (100 μl) was 975 units or a concentration of 9750 units/ml. No attempt was made to evaluate the effect of immobilization on the enzyme activity. l-Tyrosine (2 mm) or N-acetyl-l-tyrosine (4 mm) was dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by the addition of H2O2 (1 mm). The tyrosine/H2O2 solution (50 ml) was then transferred to a 60-ml syringe and deaerated by purging with N2 or argon gas for 20 min. When NO was used, the N2 or argon purge was followed by purging the solution for 10 min with NO gas. The NO gas was initially passed through a scrubbing solution (10% KOH by weight) to remove contaminating higher oxides of nitrogen before bubbling through the tyrosine/H2O2 solutions. Before use, solutions were removed from the NO system and allowed to equilibrate to the desired 1.9 mm concentration. The solution was then flowed over HRPi at 2 ml/min, and the ESR spectrum was recorded. Flow was controlled using a Harvard PHD 2000 syringe pump (Holliston, MA). The reaction mixture was in contact with the immobilized enzyme for ∼2 s while passing through the sensitive region of the ESR spectrometer. For experimental consistency, all solutions were deaerated for 20 min prior to ESR data collection. When ascorbate was included in the reaction mixture, a small volume of ascorbic acid stock solution (deionized water, N2-purged) was added to the deoxygenated tyrosine/H2O2 solution prior to the addition of NO. TheN-acetyl-l-tyrosine iminoxyl radical was generated by mixing free HRP (100 μg/ml), H2O2 (80 μm), and 3-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine (∼0.4 mm). This mixture was transferred to the ESR flat cell using an aspiration technique that allows ESR detection to be started within 10 s of initiating radical generation (25Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 4 used a phosphate buffer with 50% ethylene glycol to prevent aggregation upon freezing. Final buffer concentration was 50 mm, pH 7.8. ESR spectra (see Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) were collected at room temperature using a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with a SuperHigh Q cavity (Bruker Co., Billerica, MA) operated at 9.8 GHz with a 100-kHz modulation frequency. Spectrometer settings were 10-milliwatt microwave power, 1-G modulation amplitude, 164-ms time constant, 84-s scan time, and an average of nine scans over a 100-G scan range. ESR spectra (see Figs. 4 (A) and 5) were collected at room temperature using a Bruker Elexsys E 500 spectrometer equipped with an SHQ cavity (Bruker Co., Billerica, MA) operated at 9.8 GHz with a 100-kHz modulation frequency. Spectrometer settings were 10-milliwatt (Fig. 5) and 2-milliwatt (Fig. 4 A) microwave power, 0.5-G (Fig. 5) and 1-G (Fig. 4 A) modulation amplitude, 164-ms (Fig. 5) and 84-ms (Fig. 4 A) time constant, 84-s (Fig. 5) and 42-s (Fig. 4 A) scan time, and an average of nine (Fig. 5) and 1 (Fig. 4 A) scans over an 80-G (Fig. 5) and 100-G (Fig. 4 A) scan range. The ESR spectrum in Fig. 4 B was collected using a liquid nitrogen finger dewer on a Bruker Elexsys E 500 spectrometer. Spectrometer settings were 0.2-milliwatt microwave power, 2-G modulation amplitude, 328-ms time constant, 168-s scan time, and an average of 8 scans over a 200-G scan range.

Radical concentrations were measured by double integration of the ESR simulations of a given spectrum. The integration of the simulation provided numerical data that were unaffected by experimental baseline variations between data sets. The ESR spectrum obtained when a deoxygenated solution of l-tyrosine (2 mm), H2O2 (1 mm), and NO (1.9 mm) was flowed over HRPi at 2 ml/min is shown in Fig. 1 A. The ESR spectrum detected was a composite of two radical species that can be simulated using the known hyperfine coupling constants for the tyrosyl radical (27Sealy R.C. Harman L. West P.R. Mason R.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3401-3406Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and a radical species assigned as the tyrosine iminoxyl radical (a N = 28.4 G and a H = 2.2 G) (Fig. 2 and Scheme FS1, D). The proton coupling of 2.2 G originated from tyrosine and was assigned to the proton ortho to the phenoxyl oxygen (see “Tyrosine Isotopic Substitution”). The assignment of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical was based on reported analogous iminoxyl radical hyperfine parameters (28Thomas J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1446-1447Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Green, R. G., Sutcliffe, L. H., and Preston, P. N. (1975) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II 1380–1384Google Scholar). As outlined in Scheme FS1, the tyrosine iminoxyl radical is proposed to result from the secondary oxidation of 3-nitrosotyrosine (C) or the corresponding oxime (C′) formed from the reaction of the tyrosyl radical with NO. When NO was excluded from the reaction solution, only the tyrosyl radical was observed (Fig. 1 B). It should be noted that NO is a good substrate for either HRP-I/II3 (30Glover R.E. Koshkin V. Dunford H.B. Mason R.P. Nitric Oxide: Biol. Chem. 1999; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and that the product of this reaction is NO+, which, at neutral pH values, is converted to nitrite. The addition of nitrite did not significantly affect the ESR spectrum (Fig. 1 C) (31Roman R. Dunford H.B. Can. J. Chem. 1973; 51: 588-596Crossref Google Scholar). Only a weak, unrelated ESR signal was detected with HRPialone (Fig. 1 D). The tyrosyl radical was a necessary precursor to the tyrosine iminoxyl radical (data not shown). The tyrosyl radical ESR signal requires H2O2 (Fig.1 E) and l-tyrosine (Fig. 1 F). The structure of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical shown as D in Scheme FS1 is the most logical (18Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

Although NO can initially add to the tyrosyl radical at all positions of high spin density (Scheme FS2), C-1 (0.37), C-2,6 (−0.06), C-3,5 (0.25), C-4 (−0.03), and Ophenoxyl (0.25) (32Dole F.

Reference spectra, Fig. 3,A–C, present the tyrosyl radical spectrum (Fig.3 A), the composite spectrum containing the tyrosyl radical and the tyrosine iminoxyl radical (Fig. 3 B), and the simulation of the composite spectrum (Fig. 3 C). Note that the tyrosine iminoxyl spectrum is characterized by a single nitrogen and a single proton coupling. Isotopic substitution of l-tyrosine with the 3,5-d2-l-tyrosine (see Scheme FS1 for atom numbering) resulted in the collapse of the small 2.2-G hyperfine coupling constant of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical (Fig.3 E). This observation confirms the identity of the 2.2-G proton coupling to be in the 5 position. In addition, the tyrosyl radical spectrum changed as predicted by the difference in the gyromagnetic ratio between protons and deuterons, thus confirming the original 3,5-d2 isotopic substitution. Isotopic substitution of tyrosine with 2,6-d2-l-tyrosine did not affect the tyrosine iminoxyl radical signal (Fig.3 H), although the tyrosyl radical ESR spectrum changed accordingly, again confirming the original 2,6-d2 isotopic substitution. 4The experimental spectrum of the 2,6-d2-l-tyrosine/NO spectrum (Fig. 3 H) appears to contain additional radical species not accounted for in the simulation (Fig. 3 I). To further verify the assignment of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical, we synthesized 3-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine (Scheme FS1,C), a proposed intermediate in the HRP/H2O2/tyrosine/NO system. 3-Nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine was synthesized (as opposed to 3-nitroso-l-tyrosine) because the solubility of the starting material N-acetyl-l-tyrosine was considerably greater than l-tyrosine and also to prevent additional chemistry at the amine group of tyrosine. The oxidation of 3-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-tyrosine by HRP/H2O2 resulted in an ESR spectrum nearly identical to that detected in the HRPi/H2O2/tyrosine/NO system, with hyperfine coupling constants a N = 28.2 G anda H = 2.2 G (Fig.4 A). TheN-acetyl-l-tyrosine iminoxyl radical was formed in a 50% ethylene glycol-buffered solution; identical spectra were obtained in purely aqueous buffers (data not shown). At the time that the solution phase spectrum was collected, a portion of the reaction mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The ESR spectrum collected at 77 K was that of an immobilized iminoxyl radical nearly identical to that observed in photosystem II (18Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and prostaglandin H synthase-2 (19Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17086-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) systems (Fig. 4 B). The ESR hyperfine coupling parameters measured from the immobilized ESR spectrum shown in Fig. 4 Bare A∥ = 39.0 G and A∥ = 20.8 G with Aiso = (A∥ + 2A⊥)/3 = 27.1 G. Computer simulation of this immobilized iminoxyl radical generated the following values: Axx = 21.5 G, Ayy = 25.5 G, Azz = 40.5 G, gxx = 2.0064, gyy= 2.0051, and gzz = 2.0022, linewidths x = 2.4 G, y = 5.0 G, and z = 4.6 G. The ability to detect the N-acetyl-l-tyrosine iminoxyl radical depended markedly on the H2O2concentration. The higher the H2O2concentration, the larger the initial flux of iminoxyl radical, but the shorter the lifetime. This dependence on the H2O2 concentration implies that the iminoxyl radical is also a suitable HRP-I/II substrate presumably being oxidized to nitrotyrosine (18Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

For this reason we investigated the reaction of the tyrosyl radical/tyrosine iminoxyl radical with the antioxidant ascorbate. The data shown in Fig.5 usedN-acetyl-l-tyrosine as opposed tol-tyrosine because background signals attributed to tyrosine oxidation products were much more prevalent in the case ofl-tyrosine. The addition of ascorbate to the HRPi/H2O2/N-acetyl-l-tyrosine system decreased the N-acetyl-l-tyrosyl radical signal as expected (Fig. 5, trace A) (38Rao D.N.R. Fischer V. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 844-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Sturgeon B.E. Sipe H.J. Barr D.P. Corbett J.T. Martinez J.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

The addition of ascorbate to the HRPi/H2O2/N-acetyl-l-tyrosine/NO system decreased both the N-acetyl-l-tyrosyl radical signal (Fig. 5, trace B) and theN-acetyl-l-tyrosine iminoxyl radical signal (Fig. 5, trace C). The rate of ascorbate reduction of theN-acetyl-l-tyrosyl radical was similar in the presence and absence of NO. The rate of ascorbate reduction of theN-acetyl-l-tyrosine iminoxyl radical appears to follow that of the N-acetyl-l-tyrosyl radical, indicating that ascorbate is reacting faster with theN-acetyl-l-tyrosyl radical than with theN-acetyl-l-tyrosine iminoxyl radical. It should be noted that ascorbate is a relatively poor substrate for HRP-I/II (40Yamazaki I. Piette L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 50: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 41Yamazaki I. Pryor W.A. Free Radicals in Biology. Academic Press, New York1977: 183-218Crossref Google Scholar). Our results support the reaction mechanism for tyrosine iminoxyl radical formation shown in Scheme FS1. We have confirmed the existence of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical, with structure D in Scheme FS1, and that this iminoxyl radical is an enzymatic oxidation product from a solution containing tyrosine and NO. The synthesis and oxidation of 3-nitroso-N-acetyltyrosine provides additional support that 3-nitrosotyrosine (C in Scheme FS1) is the intermediate in the pathway depicted in Scheme FS1. In addition, the immobilized (77K) ESR spectrum of the N-acetyltyrosine iminoxyl radical has ESR parameters nearly identical to the iminoxyl radicals detected in photosystem II and prostaglandin H synthase-2, further supporting the formation of these intermediates in these enzyme systems. In addition to the structural and mechanistic information, the reactivity of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical with the antioxidant ascorbate (AscH−) has been shown to be primarily dependent on the concentration of the tyrosyl radical. The primary reactions involved are shown in Reaction Scheme FS1.Tyrosyl radical+AscH−→tyrosine+Asc⨪Equation 1 Tyrosyl radical+NO⇄tyrosyl radical/NO weak complex(B)Equation 2 Tyrosyl radical/NO weak complex→nitrosotyrosine(C/C′)Equation 3 Nitrosotyrosine→tyrosine iminoxyl radical(D)Equation 4 Tyrosyl radical/NO weak complex→tyrosine iminoxyl radicalEquation 5 Tyrosine iminoxyl radical+Asc−→nitrosotyrosine+Asc⨪Equation 6 REACTION SCHEME1Ascorbate and NO effectively compete for the tyrosyl radical, k1 = 4.4 × 108m−1 s−1 (42Hunter E.P.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3031-3036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) apparently results in more ascorbate quenching of the tyrosyl radical (Fig. 5). Note that 1 mm ascorbate quenches all tyrosyl radical and tyrosine iminoxyl radical (Fig. 5,B and C), but 1.9 mm NO quenches only ∼20% of the tyrosyl radical (compare trace A withtrace B). This situation is complicated by the change in enzyme kinetics in the presence of NO. 3HRP enzyme kinetics in the presence of NO are quite different in the absence of NO. When tyrosine is the only reducing substrate, HRP enzyme kinetics are determined by the relatively slow HRP-II oxidation of tyrosine. Because NO is a good substrate for both HRP-I and HRP-II, when NO is present, we are not under HRP-II limiting conditions, and the tyrosyl radical concentration is HRP-I-dependent but in competition with NO for HRP-I. The HRPi/H2O2/tyrosine/NO system under investigation here clarifies a previous discussion about the formation of the tyrosyl radical-NO weak complex in the presence of additional oxidizing equivalents (18Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17086-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The reversible reaction of NO and tyrosyl radical can act to “buffer” the tyrosyl radical concentration (45Stanbro W.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 197: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Since the HRPi/H2O2 system described in this paper can provide oxidizing equivalents (as is the case with photosystem II and prostaglandin H synthase-2), the relatively slow reversible nature of the NO/tyrosyl radical reaction may be less important especially if the tyrosyl radical-NO weak complex can be directly oxidized to the tyrosine iminoxyl radical (Reaction Scheme FS1, Eq. 5). The observation of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical from the HRPi/H2O2/tyrosine/NO system allows us to make the following conclusion. The reaction between tyrosyl radical and NO forms oxidizable tyrosyl radical-NO intermediates (B, C, or C′); when these intermediates were formed in an oxidizing environment, one or more of them underwent a one-electron oxidation to form the tyrosine iminoxyl radical. Although nitrosotyrosine was not demonstrated to form as an intermediate, synthesized N-acetylnitrosotyrosine was facilely oxidized to the N-acetyltyrosine iminoxyl radical. It should be pointed out that the source of the oxidizing equivalence needed to form the tyrosine iminoxyl radical in the HRPi/H2O2/tyrosine/NO system is HRP-I, HRP-II, or even the tyrosyl radical. Because the steady-state concentration of the tyrosyl radical is quite low, it is not expected to be the major source of oxidizing equivalents in our system. In non-enzymatic radical generating systems, the tyrosyl radical may be the only source of oxidizing equivalents, and thus the formation of the iminoxyl radical would be expected to be significantly less than in an enzymatic system (46Goldstein S.

Transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs),1 large supramolecular assemblies that span the nuclear envelope (NE) (reviewed in Ref. 1Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although the NPC accommodates passive diffusion of molecules smaller than ∼40 kDa, most macromolecules are transported through the NPC by signal- and energy-dependent mechanisms (reviewed in Refs.2Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar and 3Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In most well characterized cases, nuclear protein import and export is mediated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling receptors of the karyopherin/importin β family, which are thought to translocate their cargoes by interacting with a series of NPC proteins (nucleoporins) (reviewed in Ref. 2Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The best characterized nuclear import pathway involves cargo proteins containing a basic amino acid-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is recognized by the import receptor importin β, either directly or via the adapter importin α. In the most extensively studied nuclear protein export pathway, leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs) are recognized by the karyopherin β-related receptor CRM1 (reviewed in Ref. 3Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The small GTPase Ran, which shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, plays a key role in regulating nuclear transport mediated by karyopherin β-like receptors (reviewed in Refs. 2Gorlich D.

Because of the segregation of the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 in the nucleus and the Ran GTPase-activating protein in the cytoplasm, the GTP-bound form of Ran is thought to be concentrated in the nucleus and the GDP-bound form in the cytoplasm. RanGTP, which interacts with both import and export receptors, promotes cargo dissociation from import receptors and cargo binding to export receptors in the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 2Gorlich D.

On the other hand, the involvement of karyopherin β-related receptors in the export of cellular mRNAs remains uncertain. It is widely believed that proteins bound to mRNAs interact with the nuclear transport machinery to drive export through the NPC (for reviews, see Refs. 4Melchior F. Gerace L.

A region near the N-terminus binds the karyopherin β-related receptor transportin, which mediates efficient nuclear import of Tap (20Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Pante N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Gorlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25Truant R. Kang Y. Cullen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32167-32171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A second region located at the very C terminus (residues 540–619) can mediate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in and out of the nucleus and is suggested to be critical for the export of mRNA (24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 26Kang Y. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5863-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that this C-terminalnuclear transport domain (NTD) of Tap can directly bind to Nup214 and Nup98 in vitro (18Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 20Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Pante N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Gorlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M.

EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whether this interaction is sufficient for nuclear transport remains unclear. Here we have developed an in vitro assay to study export mediated by the C-terminal NTD of Tap. Our results indicate that the Tap NTD mediates nuclear export in the absence of Ran and other nucleocytoplasmic shuttling receptors/factors by making direct contact with nucleoporins localized in different regions of the NPC. Furthermore, the NTD promotes nuclear import as efficiently as nuclear export, supporting the notion that the Tap NTD mediates nondirectional translocation through the NPC. The implications of these findings for mRNA export are discussed. For the construction of the mammalian expression vector encoding the reporter protein for nuclear export, three additional tandem copies of the FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) were cloned into the XhoI-SalI of the pBJ5 vector (a gift from Dr. G. Crabtree (28Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)), resulting in an expression cassette consisting of four copies of FKBP12 fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the SV40 T antigen NLS. For all His-tagged bacterial expression constructs theFKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB) and various nuclear export sequences were cloned into pTrcHisA (Invitrogen). The sequence comprising the FRB-Rev NES fusion was obtained from a mammalian expression vector (provided by Dr. G. Crabtree (28Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)) and cloned as a XhoI/EcoRI fragment into pTrcHisA. For the FRB-Tap NTD fusion, FRB was amplified by PCR as a XhoI/SacI fragment that introduced a four-residue glycine linker at the C terminus. The Tap NTD (residues 540–619) was amplified by PCR from pFLAG-Tap (a gift from Dr. B. Biesinger), introducing a 5′ SacI site and a 3′SalI site. The FRB and Tap PCR products were cloned into the XhoI/SalI sites of pTrcHisA. To produce an expression vector encoding FRB fused to the mutant Tap NTD A17 (24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), a region comprising residues 540–619 of the A17 mutant was obtained by PCR using pcTap-A17 (provided by Dr. B. Cullen) as a template. The A17 PCR fragment together with the FRB PCR fragment were cloned into the XhoI/SalI site of pTrcHisA. All constructs contain a hemagglutinin epitope. For immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies, the hemagglutinin tag in these bacterial expression vectors was replaced by the FLAG epitope. The wild type Tap NTD and the Tap A17 NTD were PCR-amplified and introduced as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment into the bacterial GST fusion expression vector pGEX-KG. The accuracy of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. 6×-His-tagged FRB-Rev NES, FRB-Tap NTD (residues 540–619), FRB-Tap A17 NTD (residues 540–619), and FRB were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 by induction at 37 °C and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow® beads (Qiagen). GST, GST-Tap (residues 540–619,) and GST-A17(residues 540–619) were expressed in E. coli BL21 by induction at 37 °C or at room temperature for GST-A17 (residues 540–619). The fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The following recombinant proteins were obtained as described: wild-type Ran and RanQ69L (29Melchior F. Sweet D.J. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), RanT24N (30Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), CRM1 (31Guan T. Kehlenbach R.H. Schirmer E.C. Kehlenbach A. Fan F. Clurman B.E. Arnheim N. Gerace L. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and Nup62 and Nup58 (33Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The 6×-His-tagged Ran binding domain 3 (RBD3) of human Nup358/RanBP2 (residues 2293–2446) was cloned into pPET28a and expressed as described for RanBP1 (32Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The 6×-His-tagged C-terminal fragment of human Nup214/CAN (residues 1861–2090) was expressed in E. coli at 37 °C and purified by binding to SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and elution with 300 mm NaCl followed by a second affinity selection on a nickel nitrilotriacetic column (see the last paragraph). The C-terminal FG repeat-containing fragment of human Nup153 (residues 895–1476) was expressed as a GST fusion protein and cleaved from GST with thrombin. The fragment was purified by anion and cation exchange chromatography. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Stable HeLa cell lines were obtained by co-transfecting the GFP export reporter construct and pcDNA3(−) (Invitrogen) using SuperFect (Qiagen). Approximately 30 G418-resistant clones were pooled and treated overnight with 250 nm trichostatin A (Wako Bioproducts) to increase the expression of the reporter. Cells with high GFP fluorescence were enriched three times by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). Trichostatin was omitted in the last enrichment step. The nuclear localization of the reporter protein was verified by fluorescence microscopy. The expression of the full-length FKBP-GFP-NLS protein was confirmed by immunoblotting using an anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co). Subconfluent HeLa cells expressing the GFP reporter protein were trypsinized and washed once with 10% fetal calf serum in transport buffer (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) followed by another washing step in transport buffer. Resuspended cell pellets were permeabilized with 60 μg/ml digitonin as described previously (34Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The permeabilized cells were then preincubated with RanBP1 (15 μg/ml) and an ATP-regenerating system (34Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) for 5 min at 4 °C followed by 3 min at 30 °C to deplete shuttling nuclear transport factors. The standard transport reaction (50 μl in transport buffer) contained ∼250,000 cells, an ATP regenerating system, import ligand (Cy5-NLS-BSA at ∼2.5 μg/ml), cytosolic extract (∼1 mg/ml), Ran (25 μg/ml), FRB-NES (∼20 ng/ml), and rapamycin (150 ng/ml). Cytosol and import ligand were prepared as described previously (34Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For reactions involving ATP depletion, the ATP-regenerating system was replaced by 100 units/ml apyrase (Sigma). For inhibition experiments, the reaction mixture contained either NS2 peptide (44 μg/ml), CRM1 (10 μg/ml), RBD3 of Nup358/RanBP2 (90 μg/ml), RanT24N (25 μg/ml), RanQ69L (25 μg/ml), leptomycin B (100 nm), or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; 150 μg/ml) as indicated. Export reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 25 min and stopped by the addition of ice-cold transport buffer. After centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the cells were resuspended in a small volume of transport buffer, and the average nuclear fluorescence of the GFP reporter protein and Cy5-NLS-BSA in ∼10,000 cells was measured using a FACSScan® flow cytometer (Becton and Dickinson). The monitoring of nuclear export by fluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (34Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) except that a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV inverted microscope interfaced to a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal system was used. Microscopic parameters were identical for each series of acquired images, and digital data were processed identically using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). To visualize NE staining of the export reporter (Fig. 6), the export reaction was carried out for 5 min and then stopped by adding ice-cold transport buffer. The cells were adsorbed to coverslips, fixed with methanol as described (31Guan T. Kehlenbach R.H. Schirmer E.C. Kehlenbach A. Fan F. Clurman B.E. Arnheim N. Gerace L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5619-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and analyzed as described above. For monitoring of the diffusion-mediated entry of FRB fusion proteins into the nucleus of permeabilized cells, HeLa cells expressing the GFP reporter protein were grown on coverslips and permeabilized with digitonin as described. The cells were incubated in transport buffer containing 5 mg/ml BSA, FLAG-tagged FRB-NES proteins, and rapamycin (150 ng/ml). After an incubation of 10 min on ice, cells were washed three times with transport buffer, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at 20 °C. The cells then were labeled for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with a rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by Alexa 594-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). For real time imaging of nuclear import, GST-Tap NTD (residues 540–619) protein was labeled at a molar ratio of 1:1 with FluoReporter Oregon Green 488®(Molecular Probes). Free dye was removed by using a Nap5®column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were inverted in a reaction mixture in transport buffer containing 5 mg/ml BSA, an ATP-regenerating system, and the labeled GST-Tap NTD (0.4 mg/ml). In some cases, WGA (1 mg/ml) was included or cells were subjected to one cycle of freeze-thawing in liquid N2 before the reaction. Cells were incubated at 20 °C, and nuclear accumulation of fluorescent GST-Tap NTD was monitored by periodic scanning with a confocal microscope. In the time course experiments, images were acquired from different fields of cells for each time point. The average fluorescence intensity was obtained through the histogram function in Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Between 50 and 80 cells from 4–5 independent experiments were counted for each time point, and the standard deviation was calculated from the mean intranuclear fluorescence/extracellular fluorescence ratio. For intranuclear fluorescence determinations, nuclear rim staining was excluded. NEs were prepared as described (35Gerace L. Blum A. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 79: 546-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). 50 A260 units of NE (derived from ∼1.5 × 108 nuclei) were solubilized for 20 min on ice in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm KF, 100 μm NaVO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was precleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads. 10–30 μl of the cleared extract was added to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads to which were bound 1 mg/ml GST, GST-Tap NTD (residues 540–619), or GST-Tap NTD A17 (residues 540–619). To analyze direct binding of recombinant nucleoporins to GST fusion proteins, the beads were incubated with the Nup214 fragment (7.5 μg/ml), Nup153 fragment (10 μg/ml), or recombinant Nup62 (10 μg/ml) (each ∼ 0.25 μm) in Nonidet P-40 buffer as described above. In the case of Nup62, 10 mg/ml BSA was included in the binding reaction. After incubation for 60 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed 4 times with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. For competition experiments, beads with bound GST fusion proteins were incubated with CRM1 (75 μg/ml), Ran-GMPPNP (25 μg/ml; preloaded as described in Kehlenbach et al. (32Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or NS2 peptide (2 μg/ml) in various combinations as indicated (each ∼ 0.8 μm). The incubation and washing was performed as described above except that the Nonidet P-40 buffer contained 30% transport buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting or silver staining. Antibodies used for immunoblot analysis were the mouse monoclonal antibodies RL1 and RL2 (36Snow C.M. Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against residues 515–937 of rat Nup98, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus (residues 2075–2090) of human Nup214 (32Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), a rabbit anti-Nup153 anti-peptide antibody prepared as described in Pante et al. (37Pante N. Bastos R. McMorrow I. Burke B. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and a rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat Nup58 and rat Nup62 (33Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). All polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified using immunizing antigens. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked by overnight incubation with 5% milk powder in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce; 1:10,000 in TBST) were used as secondary antibodies. The enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) was used for visualization of proteins. It has been shown previously that the Tap protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (18Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A 79-residue stretch at the C terminus of Tap (residues 540–619) can drive the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of a GST fusion protein (24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and is designated here as the NTD. This Tap region is critical for export of constitutive transport element-containing RNAs, suggesting that it may be key to the export of certain cellular mRNAs (26Kang Y. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5863-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We developed an in vitroassay for quantitative biochemical analysis of nuclear export mediated by this Tap region (Fig. 1). Our assay was based on a previously described in vivo assay involving the rapamycin-mediated linkage between a reporter protein localized in the nucleus and a NES (28Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Rapamycin binds with high affinity (0.4 nm) to the FKBP12 (38Dumont F.J. Melino M.R. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L. Fischer P.A. Sigal N.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1418-1424PubMed Google Scholar). The composite surface formed from this interaction binds strongly to the FRB of FRAP (Ref. 28Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and references therein). Thus, a protein fused to FKBP and a second protein fused to FRB can be linked stably by the addition of rapamycin. Our in vitro export assay involved the use of HeLa cells that were stably transfected with a reporter plasmid coding for four copies of FKBP12 fused to the GFP and the NLS of the SV40 large T antigen (Fig. 1). The reporter, whose size (78 kDa) exceeds the diffusion limit of the NPC, is constitutively localized to the nucleus in vivo. After permeabilization of the cells with digitonin and a preincubation step to deplete shuttling transport factors (see “Experimental Procedures”), cells are incubated in the absence or presence of exogenous cytosol at 0 °C together with rapamycin and a FRB-NES fusion protein. The latter, because of its relatively small size (<30–40 kDa), can enter the nucleus by passive diffusion through the NPC. After a subsequent incubation at 30 °C, the export of the GFP reporter, which is driven by the rapamycin-linked FRB-NES fusion, is analyzed by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. To analyze Tap-mediated export, we prepared a fusion protein containing FRB attached to the NTD of Tap (residues 540–619). As a control, we made a FRB fusion protein containing the well characterized leucine-rich NES of Rev (9Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), whose export is mediated by the karyopherin β-related receptor CRM1 (39Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). The sizes of the Tap and Rev fusion proteins, which were 22 and 15 kDa, respectively, were well below the limit for free diffusion into the nucleus. When the cells were incubated with the FRB-NES fusions (Rev NES or Tap NTD) in the presence or absence of rapamycin at 0 °C, the FRB-NES fusion proteins became strongly localized to the nucleus only in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 2 A) by rapamycin-induced binding to the nondiffusable FKBP-GFP reporter. The reporter remained localized in the nucle"

Several CTL-defined peptide melanoma antigens have been molecularly identified. They derive from proteins localized in several subcellular compartments, including the cytosol (MAGE-A1 and -A3, NY-ESO-1), the nucleus (MAGE-A10), and melanosomes (gp100, tyrosinase), lysosome-related organelles specialized in the biosynthesis of melanin (1Amar-Costesec A.

Whereas most of the known melanoma-associated proteins localized in the nucleus and cytosol are also found in other tumor types, those localized in melanosomes are exclusively present in cells of the melanocytic lineage (both transformed, i.e. melanoma, and normal cells). They therefore constitute lineage specific tumor antigens. Melan-AMART-1 (called hereafter Melan-A) expression is restricted to normal and transformed melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelium, and thus also belongs to the family of melanocyte lineage-specific proteins (6Kawakami Y. Eliyahu S. Sakaguchi K. Robbins P.F. Rivoltini L. Yanelli J.R. Appella E. Rosenberg S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Melan-A is a relatively small polypeptide of 118 amino acids, with an apparent molecular mass of 22–24 kDa and is devoid of Asn-linked glycosylation sites. The sequence contains a putative transmembrane domain (residues 27–48) and subcellular fractionation analysis has suggested that Melan-A is present in melanosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7Kawakami Y. Battles J.K. Kobayashi T. Ennis W. Wang X. Tupesis J.P. Marincola F.M. Robbins P.F. Hearing V.J. Gonda M.A. Rosenberg S.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cDNA coding for Melan-A was originally isolated by functional screening of expression libraries using melanoma-specific CTL (6Kawakami Y. Eliyahu S. Sakaguchi K. Robbins P.F. Rivoltini L. Yanelli J.R. Appella E. Rosenberg S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 8Coulie P.G. Brichard V. Van Pel A. Wolfel T. Schneider J. Traversari C. Mattei S. De Plaen E. Lurquin C. Szikora J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In contrast to the known HLA-A2-restricted antigenic peptides derived from tyrosinase, TRP-1 and gp100, which are located in the extracytosolic domain of these proteins, the immunodominant Melan-A CTL-defined epitope (Melan-A26–35) is embedded within the putative transmembrane domain, except for the first amino acid (Glu26). The generation of HLA class I-restricted antigenic peptides, including peptide tumor antigens, usually takes place in the cytosol and involves degradation of the proteins by the proteasome and further trimming by other peptidases (9Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). A fraction of these peptides is transported into the ER via the TAP1/2 transporters associated withantigen processing complex where the binding to HLA class I molecules occurs. Recent evidence indicates that proteins destined to the exocytic pathway or located in specific cellular organelles, as may be the case for Melan-A and other melanosomal proteins, gain access to the processing machinery through a retrograde transport mechanism from the ER to the cytosol (10Wang Y. Chen D. Androlewicz M.J. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism, proteins misfolded in the ER would be transported back to the cytosol via the translocation pore complex (Sec61 complex) and subsequently degraded by the proteasome (11Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 12Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Several examples of cellular and viral proteins degraded via this ER degradation mechanism exist (10Wang Y. Chen D. Androlewicz M.J. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Notably, retrograde transport and subsequent degradation has been shown to be involved in the processing of tyrosinase369–377/HLA-A2 (13Mosse C.A. Meadows L. Luckey C.J. Kittlesen D.J. Huczko E.L. Slingluff C.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An elevated amount of misfolded, ER-retained membrane proteins containing CTL-defined epitopes may therefore result in a more efficient generation and presentation of such epitopes at the surface of cells. In the present study, we have characterized the membrane topology of Melan-A. In the course of this analysis, we noticed that a small fraction of Melan-A was inserted into the membrane in an inverted orientation. Moreover, the subcellular localization of Melan-A was dramatically altered, when inserted in the inverted orientation. Whereas the natural Melan-A protein co-localized with Golgi markers in transfected melanoma cells, the protein with an inverted membrane topology exclusively co-localized with ER markers. We therefore investigated whether the altered subcellular localization of Melan-A influenced the presentation of Melan-A26–35/HLA-A2 in melanoma cells. The results indicated that cells expressing the mislocalized Melan-A were more efficiently recognized by specific CTL, probably due to an accelerated degradation of the mislocalized protein. Surprisingly, cells expressing a version of Melan-A that was artificially localized to the cytosol were recognized less efficiently than those expressing Melan-A with an inverted membrane topology. We conclude from this study that protein localization and membrane insertion can affect the presentation of HLA class I-restricted epitopes. All DNA constructs used in this study were based on the plasmid pGFP/Ub described earlier (14Valmori D. Gileadi U. Servis C. Dunbar P.R. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Cerundolo V. Lévy F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and were inserted in-frame to the 3′ end of the ubiquitin sequence (except for the constructs used to produce Fig. 2, see below). Constructs I and II have been described previously (15Valmori D. Lévy F. Miconnet I. Zajac P. Spagnoli G.C. Rimoldi D. Liénard D. Cerundolo V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Construct III was obtained by 2 rounds of PCR amplification. First, oligonucleotides carrying the appropriate mutations (i.e. codons for three Arg replacing Glu25, and for three Glu replacing Arg49–51) were used to amplify Melan-A fragments coding for amino acids 1–44 and 38–118, respectively, using construct I as template. The fragments were purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen AG, Basel, Switzerland). A second round of PCR using the oligonucleotides matching the 5′ and 3′ end of the Melan-A coding sequence and containing appropriate restriction sites was performed on the fragments obtained from the first round. Product of the latter amplification was digested with SacII and AvaI and introduced into theSacII-AvaI site of pGFP/Ub plasmid. Construct IV was generated in the same conditions as construct III except that construct II was used as template. Construct V was generated by inserting an extra 9 base pairs coding for 3 Lys residues between codons 38 and 39 of COOH-terminal glycosylated construct II (see below), using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) and following the manufacturer's protocol. Constructs VI and VII were obtained by introducing a termination codon at the 3′ end of codon 35 of construct II and IV, respectively. This was achieved by using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) and following the manufacturer's protocol. All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The glycosylated versions of Melan-A shown in Fig. 2 were produced by replacing the GFPha-Ub ORF with the one coding for Melan-A. In these plasmids, the Melan-A sequence was cloned into theNheI-AvaI sites. The rationale for this was that the role of the GFPha-Ub moiety in the targeting of Melan-A to the ER was unknown. Later experiments showed that this moiety did not affect the targeting of Melan-A. The glycosylation sites were introduced within the oligonucleotides used for the PCR reaction. The NH2-terminal glycosylation sequence NVT, in one-letter code, was inserted between residue 6 and 7 of Melan-A. For the COOH-terminal glycosylation site, the sequence AMMNVTGS was added to the COOH terminus of the natural Melan-A sequence, where NVT constitutes the N-glycosylation signal when exposed to the ER lumen. The construct Melan-A-NVV contained the sequence AMMNVVGS, which constitutes an incomplete glycosylation signal. The COOH-terminal glycosylated versions of constructs II and IV shown in Fig. 3 were obtained by PCR, introducing the sequence within the oligonucleotide used for the PCR reaction. In these constructs the Melan-A sequence was extended at the COOH terminus by the amino acid sequence, in one-letter code, AMMNVTGS.

Jotereau, Nantes, France, and E. Stockert, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, New York Branch, respectively) were cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum medium. These cells do not express Melan-A protein, as assessed by Western blot analysis, although SK-Mel-37 cells express low levels of Melan-A mRNA as detected by RT-PCR (not shown). Both cell lines express HLA-A2. For transient transfections, cells were plated 1 day in advance and transfected either with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) (Figs. 2, 3, and 6 A) or with FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Melan-A-specific CTL used in this study, clone 17, were derived from TILs of patient LAU 203 by limiting dilution as described (16Valmori D. Gervois N. Rimoldi D. Fonteneau J.F. Bonelo A. Lienard D. Rivoltini L. Jotereau F. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6956-6962PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-Melan-A A103 mouse monoclonal antibody was a gift from E. Stockert (17Chen Y.-T. Stockert E. Jungbluth A. Tsang S. Coplan K.A. Scanlan M.J. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5915-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes an epitope located at the COOH-terminal end of the protein (amino acids 100–110), as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with overlapping peptides synthesized according to the predicted Melan-A sequence. For double immunofluorescence experiments, A103 was used in a biotinylated form. Anti-calnexin rabbit polyclonal antibody was a gift from R. F. Pettersson, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Stockholm, Sweden. Monoclonal antibody GI/93, specific for ERGIC-53, was a gift from H.-P. Hauri (Basel, Switzerland) (18Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Anti-golgin 97 (mouse monoclonal CDF4, used at 5 μg/ml) was from Molecular Probes and the anti-HA monoclonal antibody was from Berkeley Antibodies Co. For immunofluorescence detection, the following second antibodies were used: Alexa-Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody, Cy3-conjugated streptavidin, and Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (all from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Eighteen hours post-transfection, an equal number of cells (106cells) were labeled for 20 min with 100 μCi of [35S]Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (14Valmori D. Gileadi U. Servis C. Dunbar P.R. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Cerundolo V. Lévy F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For the pulse-chase analysis shown in Fig.6 A, cells were labeled for 15 min and chased for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min in complete medium at 37 °C. Labeled cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and protease inhibitors) and maintained on ice. Cells whose lysate was subjected to phase-separation were lysed on ice in a similar lysis buffer except that the Triton X-100 was replaced by 1% Triton X-114 (19Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. Phase separation was performed by placing the cleared lysate at 37 °C for 10 min and by subsequent centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The upper phase, corresponding to the detergent-poor fraction, was transferred into a new tube and the remaining lower phase was washed by adding fresh buffer lacking Triton X-114. The tube was placed on ice for 10 min and the phase separation was repeated. After two washing cycles, the volume of the detergent-rich phase was readjusted to the original volume of the lysate. Equal volume of lysate was immunoprecipitated using a saturating amount of a monoclonal antibody anti-Melan-A (A103) and, where indicated, a monoclonal antibody anti-HA epitope. The samples were incubated with rotary shaking at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and another 30 min incubation at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed 3 times in washing buffer (i.e. lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) and, where indicated, further processed for Endo H digestion. Endo H digestion was performed by incubating the Sepharose-bound material in 70 mm Na-citrate (pH 5.5) containing 30 milliunits of Endo H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 16 h at 37 °C. Mock digests were performed under identical conditions except that no Endo H was added. At the end of the incubation period, the samples were washed once in washing buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer (14Valmori D. Gileadi U. Servis C. Dunbar P.R. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Cerundolo V. Lévy F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), boiled at 95 °C for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-12% PAGE followed by autoradiography. Quantitation of the radioactive bands corresponding to Melan-A was performed by PhosphorImager. Cells were plated in 4-well glass chamber slides (Nunc, Life Technologies) pre-coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) to enhance cell adherence. Twenty-four to 48 h after transfection, cells were rinsed with serum-free medium and fixed in acetone for 5 min at − 20 °C. Slides were incubated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, then with primary antibodies diluted in 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% human serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, fluorescent secondary antibodies were applied for 30 min at room temperature. For double labelings with two mouse antibodies, anti-Melan-A was used in a biotinylated form. In this case, incubation with unlabeled primary antibody followed by the respective second antibody was performed before staining with biotinylated A103 followed by incubation with the streptavidin conjugate. At the end, slides were mounted with 24 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo-2,2,2-octane in phosphate-buffered saline/glycerol (pH 7.5). Confocal analysis was performed with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope (Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope 410) with a ×63 Plan Apochromat objective (1.4 oil). Control cells stained with single antibodies and secondary reagents only were routinely performed. For CTL assays, transfection efficiency was assessed in parallel by immunofluorescence with either the anti-Melan-A or anti-HA antibodies. Recognition of transiently transfected melanoma cells by anti-Melan-A-specific CTL was performed by measuring the release of IFNγ. Approximately 24 h after transfection, CTL were added (at a ratio of 10:1) in CTL medium. Medium was collected 24 h later and aliquots analyzed for IFNγ content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BIOSOURCE Europe, Fleurus, Belgium). As positive control, mock-transfected melanoma cells incubated with 1 μm antigenic peptide were included in each assay. For the recognition of peptide-pulsed NA8-MEL, cells were plated in fibronectin-coated 96-well plates (2.5 × 103 cells/well). The following day, cells were incubated in the presence of the indicated concentrations of peptide and 3 μg/ml human β2-microglobulin for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed, and incubated for 24 h with CTL (10:1 ratio) before collection of medium for IFNγ assay. To inhibit proteasome activity, lactacystin (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was added to melanoma cells at 50 μm 6 h after starting transfection. Cells were incubated with the drug overnight and washed once before addition of CTL. Analysis of the primary sequence of the melanoma-associated protein Melan-A revealed the presence of a hydrophobic amino acid stretch between residues 27 and 48, flanked, on the NH2-terminal side, by two acidic amino acids and, on the COOH-terminal side, by three basic amino acids (Fig.1, construct I). This sequence arrangement suggested that Melan-A may be a type III signal-anchor protein. Type III proteins are characterized by the presence of a hydrophobic domain, which functions simultaneously as an ER targeting sequence and as a transmembrane domain, and by a cytosolically exposed COOH terminus (20Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed two sets of experiments. First, we confirmed that Melan-A is inserted into membranes. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were transfected with the UPR-based plasmid encoding GFPha-Ub-Melan-A (Fig. 1,construct I). As previously described, this plasmid allows the production of equimolar amounts of two physically distinct proteins, GFPha-Ub and Melan-A, from a single mRNA (14Valmori D. Gileadi U. Servis C. Dunbar P.R. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Cerundolo V. Lévy F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,21Lévy F. Johnsson N. Rümenapf T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were metabolically labeled, lysed in a buffer containing Triton X-114, and the lysates separated into a detergent-rich fraction (enriched in membrane-embedded proteins) and a detergent-poor fraction (enriched in water-soluble proteins) (19Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of Melan-A and GFPha-Ub in these fractions was monitored by immunoprecipitation using anti-Melan-A and anti-HA tag monoclonal antibodies, respectively. In accordance with previously published data (7Kawakami Y. Battles J.K. Kobayashi T. Ennis W. Wang X. Tupesis J.P. Marincola F.M. Robbins P.F. Hearing V.J. Gonda M.A. Rosenberg S.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), Melan-A was enriched in the detergent-rich fraction (Fig.2 A) while the soluble GFPha-Ub was found exclusively in the detergent-poor fraction. Melan-A had an identical distribution in a melanoma cell line naturally expressing Melan-A (data not shown). Second, we determined the membrane orientation of Melan-A by artificially introducing an Asn-linked glycosylation site either at the extreme NH2 or COOH terminus of the protein (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Asn-linked oligosaccharides are exclusively added to polypeptide chains whose glycosylation sites are exposed to the lumen of the ER. Expression of these modified Melan-A proteins in HEK 293 cells demonstrated that Melan-A carrying an NH2-terminal glycosylation site was glycosylated, whereas Melan-A carrying a COOH-terminal glycosylation site was not (Fig.2 B). The Asn-linked glycan could be removed by endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment. Close analysis of the autoradiography led us to detect a radioactive band corresponding to the glycosylated form of Melan-A in cells expressing Melan-A with the COOH-terminal glycosylation site (Fig.2 B, lane 1). This band disappeared after Endo H treatment and was not observed in the absence of a complete glycosylation signal (Melan-A-NVV). Reciprocally, a band corresponding to the unglycosylated form of Melan-A was detected in cells expressing Melan-A with an NH2-terminal glycosylation site (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). These results suggested that the translocation process may lead to the integration of a fraction of the Melan-A polypeptide in a “wrong” orientation. We therefore studied the biological consequences of such an inverted membrane integration by favoring this process. To this end and based on reports that membrane topology depends in part on the charge distribution of the amino acids neighboring the transmembrane domain (22Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), we undertook to invert this charge distribution. The cDNA encoding Melan-A was mutated so as to replace Glu25 by three consecutive Arg and the three Arg (Arg49–51) of the original sequence by three Glu (Fig. 1,constructs III and IV). According to the charge distribution, this should result in a protein with reversed membrane topology, i.e. a cytosolic NH2 terminus. To test this prediction, construct IV was engineered so as to carry Asn glycosylation sites at the COOH terminus. As predicted, the mutated protein was efficiently glycosylated (Fig.3), confirming the exposure of the COOH terminus to the ER lumen. In contrast, construct II carrying a COOH-terminal Asn glycosylation site remained unglycosylated. Note that, as in Fig. 2 B, the autoradiogram revealed a band corresponding to the size of glycosylated construct II. Hence, constructs III and IV encoding a variant of Melan-A will be termed inverted Melan-A (Melan-Ainv) as opposed to Melan-A in the wild-type orientation (Melan-Awt). We then asked whether the inversion of membrane topology affects the subcellular localization of Melan-A. To this end, plasmids encoding the wild-type or mutated forms of Melan-A were transfected into Melan-A-negative amelanotic SK-Mel-37 melanoma cells. These cells were selected because of their spreading properties that facilitate the discrimination of cytoplasmic organelles. Cells were then analyzed by immunofluorescence with an anti-Melan-A monoclonal antibody and by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). Melan-Awt was mainly located in a juxtanuclear area, reminiscent of the Golgi region, and, to a lesser extent, to punctate structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, a and b). Accumulation of Melan-Awt in the Golgi complex was confirmed by double immunofluorescence analysis with antibodies to an ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) marker (p53) and a Golgi marker (Fig. 4, c and e, and not shown) (23Hauri H.-P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little co-localization with the ER marker calnexin was observed (Fig.4, d and f). A more detailed analysis of Melan-A localization in melanotic melanoma cells will be reported elsewhere. In contrast, Melan-Ainv was absent from the Golgi area and present almost exclusively in a reticular network, with a staining pattern similar to that of the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 4,g-l). Similar localization of Melan-Awt and Melan-Ainv were obtained upon transfection of another Melan-A negative cell line, NA8-MEL (not shown). Furthermore, the differential localization of Melan-Awt and Melan-Ainv was not affected by the presence of artificial glycosylation signals such as those described above nor by mutations introduced within the transmembrane region to create an enhanced CTL epitope (see below). Thus, Melan-Ainv was retained in the ER, either because of a putative transport signal being inaccessible or, more likely, because of misfolding of the protein. We next asked whether the change in Melan-A localization would affect cell recognition by specific CTL. The Melan-A protein contains an immunodominant HLA-A2-restricted epitope (EAAGIGILTV, residues 26–35) (6Kawakami Y. Eliyahu S. Sakaguchi K. Robbins P.F. Rivoltini L. Yanelli J.R. Appella E.

We have previously shown that mutations in this sequence, in particular A27L, lead to the production of epitopes that are better recognized by specific CTL and induce stronger CTL responses (15Valmori D. Lévy F. Miconnet I. Zajac P. Spagnoli G.C. Rimoldi D. Liénard D. Cerundolo V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Valmori D.

In this series of experiments we used both UPR-based constructs encoding Melan-A with wild-type sequence,i.e. Melan-Awt and Melan-Ainv (Fig.1, constructs I and III), as well as constructs encoding the enhanced Melan-A epitope, i.e.Melan- A wtA27Land Melan- A invA27L(Fig. 1, constructs II and IV). Using a similar transient expression system, we have previously shown that cells expressing Melan-AA27L efficiently induce TNF release by Melan-A specific CTL, while cells expressing the wild-type epitope hardly induce TNF release (15Valmori D. Lévy F. Miconnet I. Zajac P. Spagnoli G.C. Rimoldi D. Liénard D. Cerundolo V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HLA-A2+ Melan-A negative NA8-MEL melanoma cells were transiently transfected with the different cDNAs and tested for recognition by a specific CTL clone using an IFNγ release assay. Recognition of cells expressing Melan-Ainv was consistently and reproducibly more efficient than that of cells expressing Melan-Awt (Fig.5 A). This was true both for the constructs encoding the wild-type and the enhanced (A27L) epitope, with an average of 4-fold increase in IFNγ production for the latter. The number of transfected cells as well as the expression levels of the constructs were comparable as judged by immunofluorescence analysis and by detection of the amount of reference protein GFPha-Ub, respectively (data not shown).

The DNA binding complex named E2F is a heterodimeric complex consisting of an E2F component and a dimerization partner (DP).1 To date, 6 E2F genes and 2 DP genes have been cloned (2Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). E2F-1, -2, and -3 represent a subgroup of the E2F family, and they are specifically regulated by retinoblastoma (RB) and not by the RB-related proteins, p107 and p130. In agreement with the regulation of many growth-related genes by E2F, the overexpression of E2F-1, -2, or -3 is sufficient to induce quiescent cells to enter S-phase (3Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K.

The Ras gene family encodes small GTP-binding proteins that play a critical role in cell growth control as pivotal mediators of mitogenic signals from tyrosine kinase receptors (reviewed in Ref. 8Cahill M.A. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The mutations in Ras genes, which result in constitutively activated Ras proteins, are frequent in human tumors (reviewed in Ref. 9Bos J.L. Mutat. Res. 1988; 195: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The co-expression of activated Ras together with E2F-1 and its heterodimeric partner DP-1 leads to the formation of morphologically transformed foci in primary rat embryo fibroblasts, and these cells induce tumor formation in nude mice (10Johnson D.G. Cress W. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Furthermore, double transgenic animals overexpressing E2F-1 and activated Ras in their epidermis develop skin tumors (11Pierce A.M. Fisher S.M. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the co-operation between Ras and E2F-1 in cell transformation are currently not fully understood. When expressed alone, either deregulated E2F-1 or constitutively active Ras transform immortal rodent cells (12Xu G. Livingston D.M. Krek W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, the expression of either E2F-1 or activated Ras in primary cells leads to cell cycle arrest resembling premature senescence (14Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van, A. L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W.

In both cases, the induction of the senescence-like phenotype involves an up-regulation of the expression of p19ARF, which neutralizes MDM2 and thereby stabilizes p53 (6DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A.

Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). E2F activity is tightly regulated by a number of mechanisms during cell cycle progression. E2F/DP heterodimer formation facilitates the binding and negative regulation by the product of the RB gene and its related proteins p107 and p130, collectively referred to as the pocket proteins. Indeed, the complexes of unphosphorylated RB and E2F/DP act as transcriptional repressors, which contribute to RB-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1. Complex formation is cell cycle regulated via phosphorylation of the pocket proteins by Cdk4/cyclin D and Cdk2/cyclin E heterodimers. These phosphorylations lead to dissociation of E2F/pocket protein complexes, resulting in free transcriptionally active E2F/DP heterodimers. The combination of cessation of repression of some E2F-regulated genes and activation of others by the current activated transcription factor(s) is a major step in promoting G1 exit. The additional controls of E2F-1 activity include up-regulation of its DNA binding activity by acetylation (18Marzio G. Wagener C. Gutierrez M.I. Cartwright P. Helin K. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10887-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and down-regulation of this activity via phosphorylation of DP-1 by Cdk2/cyclin A (19Dynlacht B.D.

It is subjected to cell cycle-dependent transcriptional control and its mRNA level peak in late G1. In addition, E2F-1 is a short-lived protein and is degraded by the proteasome pathway (22Hofmann F. Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Wang Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23Hateboer G. Kerkhoven R.M. Shvarts A. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L.

In view of the ability of both Ras and E2F-1 to play a role in cellular transformation on one hand and to induce premature cell senescence on the other hand, we studied possible functional relationships between Ras and E2F-1. We report here that activated Ras up-regulates both E2F-1 mRNA and protein levels. This constitutes a novel mechanism of regulating E2F-1 levels.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) by digestion withHindIII and partial digestion with BglII followed by subcloning of the fragment containing 1–1089 base pairs of the E2F-1-coding region into pcDNAIII. Cells of the packaging cell line 293T (2 × 106 cells) were co-transfected with 10 μg of ψ-ecotropic packaging plasmid, pSV-ψ-E-MLV, providing packaging helper function and 10 μg of the relevant plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. Chloroquin (25 μm final concentration, Sigma C6628) was added to the transfection medium. After 8 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, and 5 ml of medium containing retroviruses were collected at 6-h intervals. Five collections were pooled together and frozen in aliquots. For infection of Swiss 3T3 or Rat1a, cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in 3 ml of retroviral supernatant, supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma H9268). 7 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS was then added, and after 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% FCS and 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma P7130). H1299 and HEK293 cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate method. NIH 3T3 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts derived from RB−/− mice were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested 24–40 h following transfection. Cell lysis, β-galactisodase, and luciferase assays were performed essentially as described previously (27Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis 30 μg of protein from each lysate as determined by the Bradford assay or 20 μl from the luciferase assay extracts were loaded, resolved by electrophoresis on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to filters (Protran, BA 85, S&S). Filters were incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween and 5% dry milk. The binding of the primary antibodies was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA was extracted from cells using the tri-reagent method (Molecular Research Center, TR-118). 30 μg of total RNA from each sample were separated on a formaldehyde gel and then blotted to GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont) according to manufacturer instructions. The effect of Ras on E2F-1 was studied initially using co-transfection experiments. Co-expression of E2F-1 and oncogenic Ras (H-RasV12) in HEK293 cells led to a significant increase of the E2F-1 protein level. This increase in the levels of E2F-1 did not depend on the co-expression of its heterodimeric partner DP-1, because it was detected in both the absence and presence of DP-1 (Fig.1 A). Similar results were obtained using the human lung carcinoma cell line H1299 (data not shown). Levels of E2F-2 and E2F-3 were similarly elevated upon co-expression of oncogenic Ras (Fig. 1 B). However, this Ras-induced increased of E2F levels was not shared by all E2Fs, and as previously reported (31Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), activated Ras did not cause a significant change in the levels of another E2F family member E2F-4. This finding suggests that the effect of H-RasV12 on E2F level is specific to the E2F-1, -2, -3 subfamily. Additional studies focused on the effect of oncogenic Ras on E2F-1 levels. In certain settings E2F-1 can induce apoptosis (4Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Adams P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 32Kowalik T.F. DeGregori J. Schwarz J.K. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), and Ras can inhibit apoptosis (34Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the differences we detect in the E2F-1 protein level are because of changes in cell viability. H1299 cells were transfected with a green fluorescent protein expression vector together with E2F-1 either alone or with H-RasV12, and then viable transfectants were counted. No apoptotic cells were detected among the green fluorescent protein-positive cells. In the presence of E2F-1, 7.15% of all viable cells were green fluorescent protein-positive, whereas in the presence of both E2F-1 and H-RasV12, 6.3% of the viable cells were green fluorescent protein-positive. These similar values indicate that under these experimental settings, the inhibition of E2F-1-induced apoptosis by H-RasV12 is not the cause for the elevated E2F-1 protein levels. Immunostaining for E2F-1 demonstrated that as previously reported (27Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it is a nuclear protein. More importantly, the Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 levels did not affect the subcellular localization of E2F-1 (data not shown), ruling out changes in subcellular localization as the reason for changes in protein levels. The effect of Ras on E2F-1 protein levels was not limited to exogenous E2F-1. The expression of endogenous E2F-1 is cell cycle-dependent. In cells emerging from growth arrest, it peaks during late G1 (35Kaelin W.G.J. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 36Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We analyzed endogenous E2F-1 levels in H1299 cells infected with either a retrovirus expressing H-RasV12, H-RasN17, or an empty retroviral vector. As expected, E2F-1 levels increased upon serum stimulation of starved cells. Interestingly, H-RasV12 augmented the increase of endogenous E2F-1 protein level in serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, endogenous Ras activity was required for the cell cycle-dependent induction of endogenous E2F-1, because dominant negative H-RasN17 interfered with this induction (Fig.1 C). Similar results were obtained using Swiss 3T3 murine fibroblasts (data not shown). These results corroborate our data with exogenous E2F-1 and further implicate Ras in the physiological regulation of E2F-1 levels. E2F-1 is a short-lived protein and is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (22Hofmann F. Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Wang Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, a plausible mechanism explaining the Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 protein levels involves interfering with E2F-1 degradation. However, this is not the case, because analysis of E2F-1 protein stability by measurement of its half-life time indicated that the E2F1 protein stability was not significantly altered in the presence of activated Ras (Fig.2, A and B). The inhibition of proteasome activity further supported the notion that activated Ras does not have a notable effect on E2F-1 degradation. As expected, treating cells with a proteasome inhibitor MG-132 resulted in an increase in E2F-1 protein levels. In cells co-expressing E2F-1 and Ras, E2F-1 protein level was significantly higher before the addition of MG-132, but it was further increased to a similar extent upon the addition of MG-132 (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 protein levels is most probably not because of the inhibition of E2F-1 protein degradation. We next studied the effect of Ras on E2F-1 levels using a Rat-1a-derived cell line containing a stably integrated Zinc-inducible E2F-1 (Rat-1a-MT-wtE2F-1) (4Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Adams P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Infection of these cells with a retrovirus harboring H-RasV12 resulted in a significant increase in E2F-1 protein after the addition of Zinc (Fig.3 A). This increase was accompanied by an elevation in E2F-1 mRNA (Fig. 3 B). A similar elevation was detected in endogenous E2F-1 mRNA levels upon the infection of Swiss 3T3 cells with a retrovirus harboring H-RasV12. Hence, Ras elevates E2F-1 mRNA levels. Ras-dependent transcriptional regulation of the E2F-1 gene is probably not the underlying mechanism, because the increase in E2F-1 was detected also when E2F-1 expression was driven by heterologous promoters (Figs.1 A and 3 A). Therefore, we next studied the effect of Ras on the half-life of E2F-1 mRNA. As can be seen in Fig.3 C, exogenous E2F-1 mRNA was easily detectable in Rat-1a-MT-wtE2F-1 cells, however, its levels were reduced below detection level 3 h after the addition of actinomycin D. In the presence of activated Ras E2F-1, mRNA levels were not significantly changed after 3 h and were only slightly reduced after 5 h of the same treatment. These data indicate that activated Ras leads to a significant increase in E2F-1 mRNA stability. The Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 mRNA levels was detected when oncogenic Ras was co-expressed with an E2F-1 expression plasmid containing the full E2F-1-coding region and no 3′ or 5′ non-coding sequences (i.e. 1–1311 base pairs of the coding region). A similar Ras-induced increase was detected when using an E2F expression plasmid containing 1–1089 bases of the coding region (encoding amino acids 1–363). In contrast, the co-expression of oncogenic Ras did not elevate the mRNA levels of a truncated E2F-1, containing only 381–1311 bases of its coding region (Fig.3 D). These data indicate that the effect of oncogenic Ras on E2F-1 mRNA stability is mediated by an element within 1–381 bases of the E2F-1-coding sequence. Because Ras activates a number of signal transduction pathways, we tested which of these pathways plays a role in controlling E2F-1 protein levels. Co-expression of either activated PKB or activated MEK together with E2F-1 resulted in elevated E2F-1 protein levels (Fig. 4,A and B), indicating that both the PI3K/PKB pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/MEK pathway can contribute to the Ras-dependent increase in E2F-1 levels. The Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 protein levels was not blocked by either the PI3K inhibitor Wortmanin alone or by the MEK inhibitor PD-098059 alone (Fig. 4 C). However, it was diminished upon simultaneous treatment of cells with both inhibitors (Fig.4 C), further supporting the notion that both PKB and MEK play a role in the Ras-induced increase of E2F-1 levels. A well established effect of activated Ras on the RB/E2F pathway involves Ras-induced accumulation of cyclin D1. This accumulated cyclin D1 complexes with Cdk4, resulting in the phosphorylation of RB and the release of active E2Fs. Indeed, the presence of functional RB was shown to be essential for some of the effects of Ras on cell proliferation (26Peeper D.S. Upton T.M. Ladha M.H. Neuman E. Zalvide J. Bernards R. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Nature. 1997; 386: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 37Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, this effect of Ras on the cyclin D/Cdk4/RB/E2F pathway does not lead to an increase in E2F-1 levels. To test whether RB is required for the increase that we observe, we studied the effect of H-RasV12 on the levels of an E2F-1 mutant lacking the RB binding domain E2F-1Δ18. As can be seen in Fig.5 A, the levels of both wtE2F-1 and E2F-1Δ18 were similarly increased upon the co-expression of activated Ras, suggesting that the effect of Ras is RB-independent. Furthermore, the co-expression of H-RasV12 and E2F-1 in 3T3 fibroblasts derived from RB−/− mice led to an increase in E2F-1 protein levels, similar to that detected in WT 3T3 cells (Fig.5 B). Thus, RB is dispensable for this increase. The Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 levels is accompanied by an increase in the promoter activity of an E2F-regulated gene, suggesting that the Ras-induced E2F-1 is transcriptionally active (Fig.6). Overall, the data presented here demonstrate that activated Ras leads to an increase in E2F-1 mRNA and protein levels that results in enhanced E2F transcriptional activity. Both Ras and E2F-1 play pivotal roles in the control of cell proliferation, and they collaborate in cell transformation both in tissue culture experiments and in transgenic mice. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which these two regulators of cell growth cooperate are not fully understood. This collaboration may involve initiation of distinct cascades of events that converge downstream to E2F-1 and Ras, although an effect of one of these two proteins on the activity of the other may also contribute to such a collaboration. We demonstrate here that oncogenic Ras induces an increase in the levels of E2F-1 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the dominant negative RasN17 abolishes the induction of E2F-1 in quiescent cells upon serum stimulation, indicating that endogenous Ras plays a role in the regulation of endogenous E2F-1 levels. High levels of transcriptionally active E2F-1 were shown to induce S-phase entry in quiescent immortal cells (3Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 4Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Adams P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 38Shan B. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8166-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Ras brings about the accumulation of transcriptionally active E2F-1 (Fig. 6), and therefore, this ability of Ras to up-regulate E2F-1 levels may be an important factor in the biological activities of E2F-1. Furthermore, its ability may play an important role in the collaboration between Ras and E2F-1 in controlling cell growth, although additional molecular mechanisms most probably are involved. For example, Ras and E2F-1 might collaborate on the activation of the phosphatase Cdc25A that is a known E2F target gene (7Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and is directly phosphorylated and activated by the Ras/Raf pathway (39Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Another possible point of convergence of E2F-1 and Ras activities may be the control of the kinase activity of the cyclin E·Cdk2 complex. Both E2F-1 and Ras affect its activity because cyclin E is an E2F target gene (40Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 41Geng Y. Eaton E.N. Picon M. Roberts J.M. Lundberg A.S. Gifford A. Sardet C. Weinberg R.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1173-1180PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Ras plays a central role in the control of protein levels of the Cdk2 inhibitor p27kip1 (39Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar,42Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) The Ras-dependent increase in E2F-1 levels described here is reminiscent of the recently reported Ras-dependent increase in the levels of another critical regulator of cell proliferation c-Myc (31Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Both c-Myc and E2F-1 are transcription factors that regulate cell growth and cooperate with Ras in cell transformation. Ras activity results in an increase in the protein levels and the transcriptional activity of both c-Myc and E2F-1 (Ref.31Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar and this work). However, our data suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying these increases are different. Whereas in the case of c-Myc, Sears et al. (31Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrate that Ras induces an increase in the c-Myc protein stability. We did not detect a significant change in the half-life of the E2F-1 protein in the presence of constitutively active Ras (Fig. 2). Instead we observed a Ras-induced increase in the levels of E2F-1 mRNA (Fig. 3,B and D). This increase in E2F-1 mRNA levels was seen when E2F-1 expression was driven by different promoters, making a specific Ras-dependent transcriptional effect improbable. The mechanism underlying this Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 mRNA level is the enhancement of mRNA stability. This is evident from the Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 mRNA levels in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 3 C). The first 381 bases of E2F-1-coding sequence mediate the response to Ras-induced signals, because the mRNA levels of E2F-1 lacking these 381 bases are not affected by the co-expression of oncogenic Ras (Fig. 3 D). The effects of Ras on mRNA stability have been documented for other mRNA molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, fibronectin, nuclear factor 1, and ornithine decarboxylase (43White F.C. Benehacene A. Scheele J.S. Kamps M. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 44Chandler L.A. Ehretsmann C.P. Bourgeois S. Mol. Cell.

Sistonen L. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4500-4507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that E2F-1 levels are affected by both the PI3 kinase/PKB pathway and by the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. In support of this notion, the combined action of Worthmanin and PD-098059, inhibitors of PI3K and MEK, respectively, is required to significantly diminish the Ras-mediated increase in E2F-1 levels. Interestingly, the Raf/ERK and the PI3K/PKB pathways are involved also in the Ras-induced stabilization of c-Myc (47Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In addition, a similar involvement of two independent Ras effectors has been observed in a number of other Ras-induced phenomena, including the induction of parathyroid hormone-related peptide, repression of the homeobox gene product TTF-1 and prevention of caspase-3 activation (48Aklilu F. Gladu J. Goltzman D. Rabbani S.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1753-1760PubMed Google Scholar, 49Missero C. Pirro M.T. Di L.R. Mol. Cell.

The Ras-dependent regulation of E2F-1 levels is a novel functional link between Ras and the RB/E2F pathway. It comes in addition to the well established effect of Ras on the RB/E2F pathway, namely its ability to elicit an increase in the levels of cyclin D1. Ras stimulates cyclin D1 accumulation via different mechanisms including the induction of cyclin D1 gene expression (42Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell.

Complexing of the accumulated cyclin D1 with Cdk4 results in the phosphorylation of RB and the release of an active E2F from the RB·E2F complex. Indeed, the expression of the dominant negative RasN17 was shown to prevent both RB phosphorylation and the concomitant increase in E2F activity in quiescent cells stimulated by the addition of serum (37Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The effect of Ras on cyclin D results in an RB-dependent effect on E2F activity, and it leads to increased E2F activity without significant changes in E2F levels. In contrast, the Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 levels described here is RB-independent, and it occurs in the absence of RB and also in the absence of the RB binding domain in the E2F-1 molecule. The Ras-induced increase in E2F-1 levels and activity reported here constitutes a novel functional link between Ras and E2F-1, and it may be part of the explanation for their ability to collaborate in affecting cell growth.

Here we characterize the DNA polymerase activity of S. pombe GST-Eso1 fusion protein and a truncated version containing only the Polη domain. Both proteins exhibit a similar DNA polymerase activity with a low processivity, and steady-state kinetic analyses show that on undamaged DNA, both proteins misincorporate nucleotides with frequencies of ∼10−2 to 10−3. We also examine the two proteins for their ability to replicate a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-containing DNA template and find that both proteins replicate through the lesion equally well. Thus, fusion with Ctf7 has no significant effect on the DNA replication or damage bypass properties of Polη. The possible role of Ctf7 fusion with Polη in the replication of Cohesin-bound DNA sequences is discussed.

In S. cerevisiae, inactivation of Polη confers enhanced UV sensitivity and leads to an increase in UV-induced mutation frequencies (1McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3094-3099PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Polη to insert nucleotides opposite distorting DNA lesions and to carry out extension of the nascent DNA strand has suggested that Polη is more tolerant of geometric distortions in DNA than are other DNA polymerases which cannot bypass DNA lesions. Accordingly, both S. cerevisiae and human Polη are low fidelity enzymes, misincorporating nucleotides with a frequency of 10−2 to 10−3 (12Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7447-7450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 16Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although Polη is a low fidelity enzyme, it does not contribute to spontaneous mutagenesis, since the rate of spontaneous mutations at several loci examined remains the same in the presence or absence of Polη in S. cerevisiae(18Pavlov Y.I. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Mutat. Res. 2001; 478: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 1R. E. Johnson, L. Prakash, and S. Prakash, unpublished observations. Thus, Polη may have little or no effect on normal replication, and its function may be primarily restricted to promoting replication through DNA lesions. The Rad6-Rad18 complex, comprised of the ubiquitin conjugating and DNA binding activities (19Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 20Bailly V. Lauder S. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23360-23365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), may be a key factor in limiting Polη action to damage bypass. Although the mechanism of the Rad6-Rad18 enzyme complex remains unknown, it is possible that ubiquitin conjugation by the Rad6-Rad18 complex leads to dissociation of some protein(s) from the replication machinery stalled at a lesion site, and that, in turn, promotes the assembly of a trans-lesion DNA synthesis polymerase such as Polη into the stalled replication complex. Alternatively, Polη could be kept in an inactive state by its binding to other protein(s), and upon the infliction of damage to DNA, the Rad6-Rad18 mediated protein ubiquitination may stimulate the dissolution of the inhibitory protein(s), thereby activating Polη. Interestingly, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the eso1+ -encoded protein is comprised of two domains, of which the NH2-terminal two-thirds is highly homologous to S. cerevisiae and human Polη, and the COOH-terminal one-third is highly homologous to theS. cerevisiae Ctf7 protein (also called Eco1) (21Tanaka K. Yonekawa T. Kawasaki Y. Kai M. Furuya K. Iwasaki M. Murakami H. Yanagida M. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), an essential protein required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during S phase (21Tanaka K. Yonekawa T.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Deletion analyses have indicated that the COOH-terminal Ctf7 portion of Eso1 is sufficient and necessary for sister chromatid cohesion, whereas deletion of the NH2-terminal Polη portion increases the sensitivity to UV irradiation but has no effect on sister chromatid cohesion (21Tanaka K. Yonekawa T. Kawasaki Y. Kai M. Furuya K. Iwasaki M. Murakami H. Yanagida M. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, although the two proteins are encoded by the same gene, they retain their respective functions in sister chromatid cohesion and damage bypass. The fusion of Polη with Ctf7 in S. pombe raised the possibility that although the two proteins are encoded by separate genes in other species, even there these proteins may associatein vivo, and that association may modulate the function of one or both the proteins. For instance, it could be that association with Ctf7 inactivates Polη and its activation requires that the two proteins dissociate following the Rad6-Rad18-dependent ubiquitination of one or both proteins; alternatively, association with Ctf7 could improve the fidelity and processivity of Polη. Here, we purify the S. pombe eso1+ -encoded protein containing both the Polη and Ctf7 domains, and compare the DNA synthesis properties of Polη alone and of Polη fused to Ctf7 in Eso1. Unexpectedly, we find that fusion with Ctf7 has no effect on Polη's DNA synthesis or damage bypass ability, or on its fidelity or processivity. We discuss these observations in relation to the possible role of Polη's association with Ctf7. To obtain the full-length Eso1-(1–872) protein and the truncated Eso1-(1–609) protein which lacks the Ctf7 domain but contains the entire Polη domain, herein referred to as Polη, theeso1+ gene was amplified from the S. pombe strain JFP41 (h+ ura4-D18 ade6-M216 leu1–32) total genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide N7119 (5′-CAGGGGTACCGGATCCACATATGGAATTAGGCAAAAGCAAATTCTC-3′) and the oligonucleotide N7118 (5′-GGTCGTCGACGGATCCTCAACTTTCATAAACAGCATATCGAAG-3′) or the oligonucleotide N7117 (5′-CAGGGTCGACGGATCCTCATCTTTTGTTGTTTGTTTCATCGG-3′), respectively. The amplified DNAs were then digested with Asp-718 and SalI restriction endonucleases and cloned into YIplac211, generating plasmids pBJ796 and pBJ800, respectively. The cloned polymerase chain reaction fragments in pBJ796 and pBJ800 were sequenced and found not to contain any mutations. Subsequently, the wild type and truncatedeso1 genes were cloned in-frame with the glutathioneS-transferase (GST)2 gene under the control of a galactose-inducible phosphoglycerate kinase promoter in plasmid pBJ760 (24Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), generating the expression vectors pBJ808 and pBJ811, respectively. The GST-tagged proteins were expressed in the S. cerevisiae strain BJ5464 harboring either the plasmid pBJ808 or pBJ811. S. cerevisiae cells were grown overnight in synthetic complete medium lacking leucine (SC-leu) and containing 2% dextrose, 2.5% lactate, and 3% glycerol before diluting 30-fold in SC-leu as above but lacking dextrose. After 16 h, 2% galactose was added and cells were grown for an additional 7 h before harvesting by centrifugation. To purify GST-Eso1 and GST-Polη proteins, cells were resuspended in 2 volumes of ice-cold cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablet per 50 ml of extract (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and lysed at 4 °C in a French Press at 120,000 kilopascal. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, and cell extract was passed over a 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 10 volumes ice-cold cell breakage buffer containing 1 m NaCl, followed by 5 volumes ice-cold low salt buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The GST-Eso1 and the GST-Polη proteins were each batch eluted twice at 4 °C with 100 μl of elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 25 mm glutathione). Aliquots of each purified protein were stored at −80 °C. For measuring the fidelity of nucleotide incorporation, we used the following four 53 nucleotides. oligodeoxynucleotides as templates, which differ only in the underlined sequences: Template G, 5′-ATGCCTGCACGAAGAGTTCCTAGTGCCTACACTGGAGTACCGGAGCATCGTCG; Template A, 5′-ATGCCTGCACGAAGAGTTCGCTATGCCTACACTGGAGTACCGGAGCATCGTCG; Template T, 5′-ATGCCTGCACGAAGAGTTCAGCTTGCCTACACTGGAGTACCGGAGCATCGTCG; Template C, 5′-ATGCCTGCACGAAGAGTTCTAGCTGCCTACACTG- GAGTACCGGAGCATCGTCG. To each template, we annealed the following 30-nucleotide oligodeoxynucleotide primer, 5′-CGACGATGCTCCGGTACTCCAGTGTAGGCA. For examining replication in the presence of a cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimer (CPD), we used the following 75-nucleotide oligomer as the template: 5′-AGCTACCTAGCCTGCACGAAGAGTTCGTATTATGCCTACACTGGAGTACCGGAGCATCGTCGTGACTGGGAAAAC. The CPD template contained a cis-syn thymine-thymine (T-T) dimer at the underlined region, whereas the nondamaged control template contained two undamaged thymines. We used the following oligodeoxynucleotide primer for CPD bypass analysis: 44-mer, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGATGCTCCGGTACTCCAGTGTAGGCAT. Primers were 5′-32P-end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Labeled primers (0.25 or 0.05 μm) were annealed to templates (0.5 or 0.1 μm, respectively) in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl by heating the mixture to 90 °C for 2 min and cooling to 25 °C over several hours. The standard DNA polymerase assay (5 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 ng/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 10% glycerol, and was carried out for 5 min at 25 °C. For DNA synthesis, a 50 nm5′-32P-end-labeled primer-template G substrate and 100 μm of each of the four deoxynucleotides were used, and reactions were initiated by the addition of various concentrations (0 to 25 nm) of purified GST-Eso1 or GST-Polη proteins. Reactions were quenched in 10 volumes of formamide-loading buffer (80% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue), heated at 90 °C for 2 min, cooled on ice, and resolved on 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 5.2 m urea. DNA polymerase fidelity assays were carried out under standard conditions but contained 50 nm5′-32P-end-labeled primer-template substrate (Template G, A, T, or C), and various concentrations of a single deoxynucleotide (0 to 2000 μm). The reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 nm purified GST-Eso1 or GST-Polη, and were quenched after 2 to 20 min in 10 volumes of formamide-loading buffer. Gel band intensities of the substrates and products were quantitated using a PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). T-T dimer bypass assays were carried out under standard conditions with 10 nm 5′-32P-end-labeled primer-CPD template substrate, and no deoxynucleotide, one of the four deoxynucleotides at 100 μm each, or all four deoxynucleotides at 100 μm each. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 nm purified GST-Eso1 or GST-Polη, and quenched after 5 min in 10 volumes of formamide-loading buffer. For each concentration of nucleotide, the relative amount of the extended product was divided by the reaction time, resulting in the linear observed rate of nucleotide incorporation, vobs. Thevobs was plotted as a function of deoxynucleotide concentration, and the data were fit by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot 4.0 to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1), vobs=Vmax[S]Km+[S]Eq. 1 Vmax and K m steady-state kinetic parameters for the incorporation of the correct and incorrect deoxynucleotides were obtained from the best-fit curve. These parameters were used to calculate the frequency of deoxynucleotide misincorporation (finc) as described (25Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 26Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) using the following equation (Equation 2), finc=(Vmax/Km)incorrect(Vmax/Km)correctEq. 2 Processivity was measured by preincubating 50 nm GST-Eso1 or GST-Polη with 50 nm 5′-32P-end-labeled primer-template DNA substrate under standard conditions for 1 h. Reactions were initiated by the addition of all four deoxynucleotides (100 μm of each dNTP), and 1 mg/ml sonicated herring sperm DNA as a trap. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the trap, we performed a control reaction in which GST-Eso1 or GST-Polη was preincubated with the trap DNA and the 5′-32P-end-labeled primer-template substrate for 1 h before the addition of deoxynucleotides. After 15 or 30 s, reactions were quenched and resolved as described above for the deoxynucleotide incorporation assays. By definition, the processivity, P, is the probability that for each nucleotide incorporation event, the polymerase moves ahead to incorporate at least one additional nucleotide (27von Hippel P.H. Fairfield F.R. Dolejsi M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine the processivity of Eso1p and Polη, we first quantitated the gel band intensities of the nucleotide incorporation products at the 15-s reaction time point using the PhosphorImager. Next, we calculated the fraction of polymerase molecules that incorporated at least N nucleotides, φ N, which is the ratio of the intensity of all gel bands greater than or equal to the gel band corresponding to N nucleotide incorporations (gel band N) to the total intensity of all gel bands (excluding the unextended primer). Formally, this is expressed in the following equation (Equation 3), φN=∑x=N∞Ix∑x=1∞IxEq. 3 where I x is the intensity of gel band x. In a single DNA binding event, it takes N-1 consecutive steps, each occurring with a probability P, starting at gel band 1 to reach any gel band N. Thus, the relationship between the fraction of polymerase molecules that incorporated at least N nucleotides, φ N, and the processivity, P, is expressed in the following equation (Equation 4), φN=P(N−1)Eq. 4 Consequently, we graphed φ N, the fraction of polymerase molecules that incorporated at least N nucleotides,versus N-1, and obtained a value for the processivity,P, from the best fit curve to Equation 4 using nonlinear regression (SigmaPlot 4.0). The average number of nucleotides incorporated per DNA binding event (1/[1 − P]) was then calculated. The amino-terminal two-thirds of the S. pombe eso1+ -encoded protein shares 23% identical and 34% similar amino acid residues with the S. cerevisiae Polη, and the COOH-terminal one-third of the protein shares 24% identical and 44% similar residues with the S. cerevisiae Ctf7 protein (21Tanaka K.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which is highly conserved among eukaryotes and plays an essential role in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during DNA replication (21Tanaka K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Fig.1 depicts the conserved motifs shared between Eso1 and the S. cerevisiae Polη and Ctf7 proteins. Two C2H2 zinc finger motifs are present in Eso1, one of which corresponds to the motif present toward the COOH terminus of Polη and the other corresponds to the motif present toward the NH2 terminus of Ctf7. The five highly conserved motifs found in the Rad30/UmuC/DinB protein family (28Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12224-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), are present in the Polη portion of Eso1. To test for the influence of the COOH-terminal Ctf7-like portion on the polymerase activity of Eso1 protein, we expressed in S. cerevisiae both the full-length Eso1 protein (872 amino acids) and a truncated Eso1 protein that contains only the NH2-terminal 609 amino acids, and which corresponds to the Polη domain, as fusions with the glutathione S-transferase protein. The GST-Eso1 and GST-Polη proteins were affinity purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2 A) and their DNA synthesis and damage bypass properties were analyzed. To test for DNA polymerase activity of S. pombe Eso1 and Polη proteins, various concentrations of purified proteins were incubated with labeled primer-template DNA substrate in the presence of all four deoxynucleotides, and reaction products were resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig.2 B, both proteins exhibit nearly equivalent DNA polymerizing ability. Fidelity measures the likelihood that a polymerase will incorporate the correctversus the incorrect deoxynucleotide opposite a template residue. We used steady-state kinetics to measure the fidelity ofS. pombe Eso1 and Polη proteins opposite all four undamaged template nucleotides, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The incorporation of either the correct or incorrect deoxynucleotide was quantitated and used to calculate theVmax and K m values. S. pombe Eso1 protein (5 nm) was incubated with the primer-template DNA and various concentrations of one of the four deoxynucleotides in a standing-start reaction. As shown in Fig.3 A, to examine the insertion opposite template G, the concentration of incorrect and correct deoxynucleotide was varied from 0 to 1000 μm, and from 0 to 20 μm, respectively. The kinetics of single deoxynucleotide incorporation by S. pombe Eso1 protein opposite the template G are shown in Fig. 3 B. These data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1), and used to calculate the apparent K m andVmax parameters. As shown in TableI, the finc values for the Eso1 protein range from 2.4 × 10−4 to 6.5 × 10−3. The finc values were similarly calculated for the Polη protein. As shown in TableII, Polη misincorporates nucleotides with nearly the same frequencies as the Eso1 protein. Fig.4 compares the efficiencies (Vmax/K m) of correct and incorrect deoxynucleotide incorporation opposite templates G, A, T, and C by S. pombe Eso1 and Polη proteins. This comparison shows that the two proteins incorporate nucleotides with nearly the same efficiencies. Thus, the presence of the Ctf7 protein in the COOH terminus of Eso1 has little, if any, effect on Polη's ability to incorporate the correct or wrong nucleotides opposite undamaged template bases.Table IFidelity of S. pombe Eso1 protein on undamaged DNAPrimer- TemplateVmaxK mVmax/K mfincnm/minμmG · G0.31 ± 0.01140 ± 202.2 × 10−31.2 × 10−3A · G0.075 ± 0.00465 ± 121.2 × 10−36.7 × 10−4T · G0.51 ± 0.02110 ± 204.6 × 10−32.6 × 10−3C · G4.8 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.41.81G · A0.20 ± 0.02250 ± 1008.0 × 10−41.3 × 10−3A · A0.53 ± 0.03130 ± 204.1 × 10−36.5 × 10−3T · A5.6 ± 0.68.9 ± 2.10.631C · A0.39 ± 0.02480 ± 708.1 × 10−41.3 × 10−3G · T1.3 ± 0.22000 ± 5006.5 × 10−47.6 × 10−4A · T2.9 ± 0.23.4 ± 0.70.851T · T0.36 ± 0.05180 ± 402.0 × 10−32.4 × 10−3C · T0.41 ± 0.08290 ± 1601.4 × 10−31.6 × 10−3G · C10 ± 15.9 ± 1.91.71A · C1.4 ± 0.21400 ± 4001.0 × 10−35.9 × 10−4T · C0.72 ± 0.071800 ± 3004.0 × 10−42.4 × 10−4C · C0.12 ± 0.0146 ± 112.6 × 10−31.5 × 10−3 Open table in a new tab Table IIFidelity of S. pombe Polη on undamaged DNAPrimer- TemplateVmaxK mVmax/K mfincnm/minμmG · G0.43 ± 0.01210 ± 202.0 × 10−38.3 × 10−4A · G0.18 ± 0.01350 ± 305.1 × 10−42.1 × 10−4T · G1.2 ± 0.1170 ± 307.1 × 10−33.0 × 10−3C · G3.9 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.22.41G · A0.29 ± 0.02340 ± 708.5 × 10−47.1 × 10−4A · A1.8 ± 0.0369 ± 52.6 × 10−22.2 × 10−2T · A14 ± 212 ± 41.21C · A1.2 ± 0.1440 ± 702.7 × 10−32.3 × 10−3G · T1.2 ± 0.01280 ± 504.3 × 10−35.1 × 10−3A · T4.6 ± 0.45.4 ± 1.30.851T · T1.3 ± 0.1420 ± 503.1 × 10−33.6 × 10−3C · T0.37 ± 0.03500 ± 907.4 × 10−48.7 × 10−4G · C11 ± 0.53.8 ± 0.62.91A · C1.5 ± 0.1640 ± 1002.3 × 10−37.9 × 10−4T · C1.2 ± 0.01360 ± 303.3 × 10−31.1 × 10−3C · C0.39 ± 0.06360 ± 1901.1 × 10−33.8 × 10−4 Open table in a new tab Figure 4Comparison of efficiency (Vmax/K m) of deoxynucleotide incorporation by S. pombe Eso1 and Polη proteins.

In the base pairs shown, the first base represents the incoming nucleotide, and the second base is in the template.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Processivity is a measure of the number of deoxynucleotides a polymerase incorporates in a single DNA binding event. Processivity is expressed quantitatively as the probability,P, that following each nucleotide incorporation, the polymerase will move ahead to incorporate at least one additional deoxynucleotide (27von Hippel P.H. Fairfield F.R. Dolejsi M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To ensure that we were measuring the activity of a single DNA binding event, we included excess, nonradiolabeled sonicated herring sperm DNA to trap any polymerase molecules that dissociated from the DNA. The Eso1 (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–3) or Polη (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7–9) proteins were preincubated with radiolabeled primer-template DNA substrate for 1 h before the addition of excess herring sperm DNA and all four deoxynucleotides. To determine that the excess herring sperm DNA was indeed sufficient to prevent the re-binding of Eso1 or Polη proteins to the radiolabeled DNA substrate, the Eso1 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4–6) or Polη (Fig. 5 A, lanes 10–12) proteins were preincubated with the radiolabeled primer-template DNA substrate and the excess DNA trap for 1 h before the addition of all four deoxynucleotides. The lack of any DNA synthesis in these reactions (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6and 10–12) confirmed the adequacy of excess herring sperm DNA to trap all Eso1 or Polη molecules. The gel band intensities of the nucleotide incorporation products at the 15-s time point were used to calculate the processivity,P, and the average number of nucleotides incorporated per DNA binding event (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 5 Bis a plot of φ N, the fraction of polymerase molecules that incorporated at least N nucleotides, versus N-1 for the Eso1 protein. From the best fit curve to Equation 4, we obtained a value forP equal to 0.53 ± 0.01, which means that for each nucleotide incorporation event, the Eso1 protein has a 53% chance of moving ahead to incorporate at least one additional nucleotide. Thus, the average number of nucleotides incorporated by the Eso1 protein per DNA binding event is 2.1. Likewise, Fig. 5 C is the analogous plot for Polη. From the best fit curve to Equation 4, we obtained a value for P equal to 0.61 ± 0.01. Thus, the average number of nucleotides incorporated by Polη per DNA binding event is 2.6. The ability of Eso1 and Polη proteins to replicate through acis-syn T-T dimer was assessed using a standing start assay. As shown in Fig. 6 A, both proteins are able to incorporate a deoxynucleotide opposite the 3′ T of the dimer and to extend from it, and the DNA synthesis activity on the damaged DNA is as robust as on the nondamaged DNA. To identify the nucleotide incorporated by Eso1 and Polη proteins opposite the two Ts of the dimer, we incubated each enzyme for 5 min in the presence of dimer containing DNA substrate and containing a single deoxynucleotide G, A, T, or C, at 100 μm concentration. As shown in Fig.6 B, both proteins primarily incorporate an A residue opposite each of the Ts of the T-T dimer. The fusion of Polη to the sister chromatid cohesion protein Ctf7 in the S. pombe Eso1 protein has presented the opportunity to determine whether the fusion with Ctf7 affects Polη function. Our results indicate that the DNA synthesis activity of Polη is not affected by fusion to Ctf7, as the Eso1 and Polη proteins synthesize DNA with remarkably similar efficiencies and fidelities, and on undamaged DNA, they misincorporate nucleotides with frequencies ranging from 2 × 10−2 to 2 × 10−4. Also, the two proteins replicate a cis-syn T-T dimer equally well and both predominantly insert two A residues opposite the two Ts of the dimer. In all these properties, the S. pombe Eso1 and Polη proteins resemble S. cerevisiae and human Polη. Polη is a low processivity enzyme, dissociating from DNA quite frequently. DNA polymerases achieve processive synthesis by associating with a multimeric ring β clamp in Escherichia coli or PCNA in eukaryotes. T7 polymerase increases its processivity by forming a one-to-one complex with E. coli thioredoxin (29Modrich P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5508-5514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16224-16232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The processivity of Polη, however, is not affected by its fusion to Ctf7. Both the Eso1 and Polη proteins exhibit low processivity, inserting 2–3 nucleotides per DNA binding event. Although Ctf7 does not activate or inactivate the DNA polymerizing activity or T-T dimer bypass ability of Polη, fusion with Ctf7 may enable Polη to function in sister chromatid cohesion. Genetic studies in S. cerevisiae have suggested that a cohesion complex consisting of the Scc1, Scc3, Smc1, and Smc3 subunits is loaded onto chromosomes at the end of G1. Another protein, Scc2, although not a stoichiometric Cohesin subunit, is required for the association of the cohesion complex with chromosomes (23Toth A. Ciosk R. Uhlmann F. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The sixth protein, Ctf7, is neither a subunit of the Cohesin complex nor is it required for the association of Cohesin with chromosomes (23Toth A. Ciosk R. Uhlmann F. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Ctf7, however, is essential for the establishment of cohesion during DNA replication, but it is not required for the maintenance of cohesion during G2 and M phases (22Skibbens R.V. Corson L.B. Koshland D. Hieter P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 23Toth A. Ciosk R. Uhlmann F. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). One possible role for the fusion of Ctf7 with Polη in the Eso1 protein is that it promotes replication through chromosomal sites where Cohesin has been deposited onto DNA, and replication through such sites may be a prerequisite for the formation of protein links between Cohesin-bound sister chromatids. While the above model explains the requirement of Ctf7 in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during S phase, it fails to account for the fact that deletion of Polη has no apparent effect on sister chromatid cohesion in either yeast species. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the involvement of yet two other highly related proteins, Trf4 and Trf5, in sister chromatid cohesion. A trf4 ts trf5Δ double mutant is unable to complete S phase, and results in failure of cohesion between the replicated sister chromatids (31Wang Z. Castano I.B. de las Penas A. Adams C. Christman M.F. Science. 2000; 289: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The Trf proteins are members of the β-polymerase superfamily, and accordingly, a DNA polymerase activity has been identified in Trf4 (31Wang Z. Castano I.B. de las Penas A. Adams C. Christman M.F. Science. 2000; 289: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A role for the Trf4 and Trf5 polymerases in the replication of Cohesin-bound DNA has been previously proposed (31Wang Z. Castano I.B. de las Penas A. Adams C. Christman M.F. Science. 2000; 289: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The fact that the Trf4 and Trf5 proteins are essential for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion suggests that these polymerases are indispensable for the replication of Cohesin-bound DNA sequences, whereas the dispensability of Polη for sister chromatid cohesion would suggest that this protein plays a much less critical role in the replication of Cohesin-bound DNA. Polη may have an accessory role in the replication of Cohesin-bound DNA, where it promotes replication through some sites by the Trf4 or Trf5 polymerase. Polη may act at such sites in a manner analogous to its role in damage bypass where it salvages the replication fork stalled at a lesion site."

Gly117 is one of the residues on the C-helix within 7 Å of the heme iron on the Pro2 side of the heme in CooA. Analysis of a series of Gly117 variants revealed altered CO-sensing function and heme ligation states dependent on the size of the substituted amino acid at this position; bulky substitutions perturbed CooA both spectrally and functionally. A combination of spectroscopic and mutagenic studies showed that a representative Gly117 variant, G117I CooA, was specifically perturbed in its Pro2 ligation in both Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms, but comparison with other CooA variants indicated that perturbation of Pro2 ligation is not the basis for the lack of CO response in G117I CooA. These results have led to the hypothesis that (i) the heme and the C-helix region move toward each other following CO binding and the interaction of the heme with the C-helix is crucial for CooA activation, and (ii) this event occurs only when a properly sized heme pocket is afforded.

The only CO-sensing protein described thus far, CooA, was found in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, which can utilize CO as a sole energy source (6Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CooA uses a b-type heme to bind CO, whereupon the protein undergoes a conformational change that allows it to bind DNA and activate the transcription of genes encoding the CO-oxidation system (7Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). CooA is a homodimeric protein containing an effector-binding domain, which contains the heme, and a DNA-binding domain linked by a hinge region. The heme of CooA is six-coordinate and low spin in its Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)-CO forms, implying that CO must displace one of the axial ligands of Fe(II) CooA. Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of Fe(II) CooA was solved to 2.6-Å resolution and revealed that Pro2 of one monomer serves as one ligand to the heme iron of the other monomer and that the ligand trans to Pro2 is His77 (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Previous studies, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)1analysis and site-directed mutagenesis showed that one of the ligands in the Fe(III) form is Cys75 in the thiolate form (7Shelver D.

Cys75 is also not essential for activity, because C75S CooA shows CO-dependent activity, although the heme is unstable in the Fe(III) form (7Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The nature of the residue at position 77 is, however, absolutely critical for CO-dependent conformational changes of CooA (7Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). CooA variants altered at this position still bind CO but fail to be activated. In at least one such variant, CO is apparently bound to the “wrong” side of the heme (13Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11473-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which might be the basis for the lack of CO activation. CooA is a member of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP)/fumarate and nitrate reductase activator protein (FNR) family of transcriptional regulators (14Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins exert their function by binding a cognate DNA sequence after responding to their specific effectors (cAMP for CRP; reducing conditions for FNR; CO for CooA). The only structure known for CRP is the cAMP-bound form (15Passner J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2843-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and a variety of analyses have suggested that a substantial conformational change occurs upon effector binding (16Won H.-S. Yamazaki T. Lee T.-W. Yoon M.-K. Park S.-H. Kyogoku Y. Lee B.-J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13953-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Baichoo N. Heyduk T.

No structure has been obtained for FNR, although it appears to be activated by a very different mechanism of a monomer-dimer transition rather than a conformational change within a dimer, as in the case of CRP and CooA (19Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The structural comparison of Fe(II) CooA in the absence of effector (CO) with CRP bound to its effector (cAMP) suggested a number of differences between them, among which was a modest repositioning of the long C-helices that serve as the dimer interface in both CRP and CooA (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This has lead to the hypothesis that in CooA, effector binding causes a change in the relative positions of the C-helices, which transmits a signal to the DNA-binding domains. Presumably this repositioning either destabilizes the inactive conformation, stabilizes the active conformation, or both. It is unclear how CO binding might affect the repositioning of the C-helix, although it seems plausible that CO displacement of Pro2 allows the heme, still tethered to His77, to interact with the C-helices. To test this hypothesis, we examined the surface of the C-helices in the structure of Fe(II) CooA and noted that there are relatively few residues that are in a position to interact with the heme (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar): Gly117, Leu112, Ile113, and Leu116. In this paper, we report the importance of the heme pocket affected by substitution at the Gly117 position and the analysis provides a number of insights into the response of wild-type (WT) CooA to CO. WT CooA and CooA variants were constructed in an Escherichia coli overexpression system and a β-galactosidase reporter system as described previously (7Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L.

The purification of WT CooA and CooA variants to ∼95% purity was performed as described previously (7Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The heme content of CooA preparations was quantitated by the reduced pyridine-hemochromogen method (21DeDuve C. Acta Chem. Scand. 1948; 2: 264-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the initial screening of the heme coordination states of different CooA variants, a 50-ml culture of the cells was harvested, resuspended in 5 ml of 25 mm MOPS buffer, 0.2 mNaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, broken with a French pressure cell (∼120 MPa), and centrifuged for 30 min at 11,700 × g. The supernatant was then mixed with 0.3 g of solid hydroxyapatite resin. After unbound materials were removed from the resin, a high salt buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1.2 m KCl, and 5% glycerol was added, and the resin was washed twice. CooA was then eluted with high phosphate buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 160 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol. The eluent was precipitated with ammonium sulfate with a final saturation of 50% and stored at −20 °C until use. CooA prepared with this procedure resulted in an enrichment of CooA to ∼10% of total protein. Electronic absorption spectra of CooA variants were measured with a Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer. Anaerobic reduction of CooA samples and anaerobic addition of endogenous ligands such as CO, KCN, and imidazole were carried out as described previously (7Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L.

EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E-15 spectrometer with an Oxford Cryostat 3120 system to regulate and monitor the temperature at a microwave frequency of 9.25 GHz at 4 K and 200 microwatts (μW) for high spin signals and 22 K and 20 μW for low spin signals. EPR spectra at pH 7.4 were obtained in 25 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl. For the preparation of Fe(III) G117I CooA at pH 6.6 and 9.4 for EPR, samples were buffered by mixing 150 μl of the purified protein (dissolved in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mNaCl) with 150 μl of 200 mm buffer (MOPS, pH 6.5; glycine/NaOH, pH 9.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl to provide a final buffer concentration of ∼100 mm. EPR samples of Fe(III) G117I CooA and WT CooA at pH 3.4 were buffered by mixing 150 μl of the purified protein (dissolved in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m NaCl) with 150 μl of 400 mmglycine/HCl, pH 3.1, and 0.1 m NaCl to provide a final buffer concentration of ∼200 mm. For the EPR analysis of ΔP3R4 CooA at pH 10.2, isolated Fe(III) ΔP3R4 CooA was buffered by using 200 mm glycine/NaOH, pH 10.5, and 0.1 mNaCl. The pH of all samples for EPR spectra was confirmed after mixing using an Orion model 611 pH meter equipped with a Ross semi-micro temperature compensation electrode. The heme concentrations of WT, G117I, and ΔP3R4 CooA for EPR analyses were 145, 82, and 185 μm, respectively. Finally, all the G117I CooA samples used for UV-visible and EPR spectra contained 5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) as a stabilizing agent. The effect of pH on the UV-visible spectrum of WT CooA was monitored by adding 10 μl of 610 μm WT CooA to 990 μl of different buffer solutions. The following buffer solutions were used: pH 7.4, 100 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl; pH 6.9, 100 mm MOPS, 0.1m NaCl; pH 6.1, 100 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1m NaCl; pH 5.5, 5.3, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 100 mmacetate, 0.1 m NaCl; pH 3.4, 100 mmglycine/HCl, 0.1 m NaCl. In vitro DNA binding assays were performed using the fluorescence polarization assay described previously (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J.

Target DNA containing pCooF (purchased from Genosys) was labeled with the fluorescent dye, Texas Red, on one end of the duplex and used at the concentration of 6.4 nm. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting the binding data to a non-linear fitting equation described by Lundblad et al. (24Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Fe(II) CooA revealed that relatively few residues are present in the vicinity of the heme on the side of Pro2, one of the axial ligands in Fe(II) CooA (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These residues include Gly117, and we tested the hypothesis that the portion of the pocket provided by this residue might be important for heme interaction with the C-helix upon CO binding (Fig.1). The set of Gly117variants studied here included G117A, G117S, G117V, G117I, and G117H. As shown in Table I, the activities of these Gly117 variants in response to CO are severely perturbed in our in vivo assay. As the size of substitution at the position 117 increased (see “mole vol ” column in Table I), CO-sensing function was reduced. This CO-sensing function is indicated in Table I by the ratio of the activity of each CooA variant in the presence of CO to that in the absence of CO; this ratio is an approximate measure of the -fold activation caused by effector binding. There is also a less striking correlation between residue size and effector-independent activity: Larger residues at position 117 provided greater effector-independent activity in the Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms (Table I). It is important to note that the differences in activity in vivo of the variants are not the result of poor accumulation of heme-containing CooA, because we have shown that ∼5% active CooA (compared with WT CooA) is sufficient for maximal in vivo activity (25Thorsteinsson M.V.

Open table in a new tab The Soret wavelength maxima of Gly117 variants are also listed in Table I. Although substitutions at position 117 with relatively smaller side chains such as Ala and Ser showed wavelength maxima that were indistinguishable from that of WT CooA, G117V CooA and G117I CooA revealed a blue-shifted Soret peak at 387 nm in the Fe(III) form, characteristic of a five-coordinate high spin heme. The Fe(II) forms of G117V CooA and G117I CooA are also severely perturbed in terms of Soret maxima, and the detailed spectral properties of purified G117I CooA will be discussed below. The extent of the perturbation of both UV-visible spectra and the CO-sensing function in Gly117variants was well correlated with the size of the substitutions (TableI), with the exception of G117H, which will be discussed below. This result indicates that the portion of the heme pocket created by Gly117 is important for the ligation structure and CO-sensing function of CooA. As shown in Fig.2 B, the UV-visible spectrum of purified Fe(III) G117I CooA is typical for a thiolate-ligated five-coordinate high spin heme with a Soret peak at 387 nm and ligand-to-metal charge-transfer peak appearing at ∼640 nm. The EPR spectrum of Fe(III) G117I CooA corroborated the results of the UV-visible spectrum, displaying only high spin signal with a single population corresponding to gx = 7.15,gy = 5.02, and gz = 1.93 (Fig. 3 and TableII). This result indicates that one of the two axial ligands in the six-coordinate Fe(III) WT CooA (Fig.2 A) is selectively perturbed in the Fe(III) G117I CooA variant. The rhombicity (expressed as E/D (26Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Chen P.-F. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32563-32571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) of G117I CooA is comparable to that of a model heme-thiolate complex (Table II (27Tang S.C. Koch S.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (26Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Chen P.-F. Palmer G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1980; 255: 4801-4807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table II). On the other hand, the rhombicity of G117I CooA is significantly higher than those of nitrogen-based ligand high spin signal such as FixL (30Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rexine J.L. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13543-13552Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and soluble guanylyl cyclase (31Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3258-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The results of UV-visible and EPR spectroscopies strongly suggest that the retained ligand in Fe(III) G117I CooA is a thiolate.Figure 3X-band EPR spectra of WT CooA and CooA variants. The samples were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures”; in case of G117I CooA samples 5 mm DTT was included for increased stability. The EPR conditions for the detection of low spin signals were set to 22 K and 20 μW in the case of G117I CooA at pH 9.4 and ΔP3R4 CooA at pH 10.2 (indicated by the asterisk).

Open table in a new tab Because Cys75 is a normal ligand in Fe(III) WT CooA, we tested the hypothesis that the thiolate ligand seen above was due to this residue. We reasoned that altering Cys75 in a G117I background would have a profound effect on the protein if Cys75 was the ligand but should have no effect if another Cys residue served that role. A strain with both G117I and C75A substitutions in CooA accumulated <1% the normal level of CooA, consistent with the hypothesis that Cys75 is the ligand in Fe(III) G117I CooA (Table I). As controls, two other variants were constructed: G117I H77A and G117I ΔP3R4. H77A CooA lacks the normal His ligand of the Fe(II) form of WT CooA, and ΔP3R4 CooA is probably perturbed in the normal Pro2 ligand in both Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms of WT CooA because of the deletion of the two adjacent residues. The UV-visible spectrum of Fe(III) G117I CooA was not significantly altered in the ΔP3R4 (data not shown) or H77A backgrounds (Fig. 2 C), indicating that neither His77 nor Pro2 is likely the retained ligand in Fe(III) G117I CooA. In summary, Fe(III) G117I CooA exists only as a five-coordinate high spin heme with Cys75 as the axial ligand, indicating that Pro2, the ligand transto Cys75, is severely perturbed in Fe(III) G117I CooA. One of the general characteristics of CooA variants such as C75S and P2Y is that these variants display a significant amount of six-coordinate heme under conditions where the altered residues would have served as the normal ligand (7Shelver D.

We demonstrate that αVβ3 and αVβ5 integrins synergistically regulate smooth muscle cell migration onto vitronectin.

Phosphatidic acid production and phosphoinositide 3-kinase IA activation were triggered only upon αVβ3engagement. Blockade of αVβ3 engagement or phospholipase C activity resulted in a strong inhibition of smooth muscle cell spreading on vitronectin. By contrast, blockade of αVβ5 reinforced elongation and polarization of cell shape. Moreover, Pyk2-associated tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide 4-kinase activities measured in Pyk2 immunoprecipitates were stimulated upon cell migration. Blockade of either αVβ3 or αVβ5 function, as well as inhibition of phospholipase C activity, decreased both Pyk2-associated activities.

Despite their ability to bind the same ligand, vitronectin, αVβ3 and αVβ5 integrins represent a good example of functional differences generated by different combinations of the integrin α and β subunits. Indeed, previous data showing that blocking antibodies against αVβ3 affect both cell spreading and migration but that those directed to αVβ5 inhibit only cell migration argue in favor of specific events regulated by αVβ3or αVβ5 upon cell motility (1Delannet M. Martin F. Bossy B. Cheresh D.A. Reichardt L.F. Duband J.L. Development. 1994; 120: 2687-2702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known on the specific signal transduction pathways triggered by αVβ3 or αVβ5engagement. However, some differences have been shown, such as a more diffuse distribution of αVβ5 compared with αVβ3, which is most frequently found in focal adhesion contacts (2Wayner E.A. Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Pasqualini R. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Clustering of αVβ5 induces a weaker colocalization of actin, α-actinin, and tensin than αVβ3(4Lewis J.M. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Engagement of αVβ3 is able by itself to trigger protein kinase C or FAK1 activation and cell migration, whereas αVβ5 needs the concomitant activation of growth factors or cytokines receptors for this signaling pathway (4Lewis J.M. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The importance of phosphoinositides in chemotactic signaling was pointed out by the ability of receptors to chemotactic factors to directly bind and regulate the key enzymes phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (6Anand-Apte B. Zetter B. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies with mutant receptors have demonstrated that one of these two pathways might be predominant, depending on the cell status (7Ronnstrand L. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Johnell M. Hansen K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22089-22094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The PLC activity and the PI3K activity products have common targets involved in cell migration, such as specific isoforms of protein kinase C, calcium mobilization through either internal stocks or calcium channels, and PIP 5-kinase activity allowing PIP2 formation and interaction with actin-associated proteins. Integrins have also been shown to be able to activate PLC-γ1 and PI3K IA (p85α/p110α) through FAK regulation (8Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 9Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J.

Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) or, for some integrins, through activation of the tetraspan family-associated PI4K (12Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K. Carpenter C.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2595-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Upon cell migration, these signaling pathways contribute to an adapted response of the cell to its environment through cytoskeleton reorganization and mobilization of membrane receptors. Depending on the nature of the matrix protein and its state (intact or hydrolyzed), integrins may regulate either formation or disorganization of focal adhesions (13Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Katz B.Z. Zamir E. Bershadsky A. Kam Z. Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1047-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). PI3K was shown to regulate focal adhesion formation through modulation of integrin affinity (15Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) but also through disorganization of focal complexes (16Greenwood J.A. Pallero M.A. Theibert A.B. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1755-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because cell migration requires both focal adhesion formation at the front and focal adhesion disorganization at the rear, an important question to resolve is the nature of integrins involved at each step, and the specific enzymes activated. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration is a key process in atherosclerosis, restenosis, and angiogenesis. Because VSMCs express both vitronectin receptors, αVβ3 and αVβ5 (17Liaw L. Skinner M.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 713-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we focused our studies on phosphoinositide-dependent signaling pathways upon VSMC migration, downstream of these two integrins. Our data demonstrate that αVβ3 and αVβ5integrins are both involved in porcine VSMC migration, despite opposite roles on VSMC spreading. αVβ3 but not αVβ5 integrin engagement regulated phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) production and PI3K IA activation. Moreover, αVβ3 and αVβ5integrins were both found to control a PI4K activity associated with the FAK homolog Pyk2. Pig VSMCs were prepared from thoracic aorta of 6-week-old pigs using the explant technique (18Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For all experiments, VSMCs were used at passages 2–5. Cells were fed three times weekly and passaged by treatment with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA before confluence. Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Stable transfectants of HEK 293 cells expressing αVβ3 or αVβ5integrins were obtained from Dr. J. W. Smith (The Barnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin (G418; Sigma). Monoclonal blocking antibodies against human integrins αVβ3(clone LM609) and αVβ5 (clone P1F6) were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-Pyk2 polyclonal antibodies (#600 for immunoprecipitation; #602 for immunoblotting) were a generous gift from Dr. Ivan Dikic (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) (19Dikic I. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14301-14308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Anti-p85 and anti-human PI4K β polyclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Synthetic peptides GRGESP and GPenGRGDSPCA, obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., were dissolved in PBS. The integrin antagonists Ro 64-3567/000 (Ro 64) and Ro 66-2486/000 (Ro 66) were kindly provided by Drs. Thomas Weller and Leo Alig (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and dissolved in Me2SO. Ro 64-3567/000 and Ro 66-2486/000 were characterized by solid phase assays and cell adhesion assays. Solid phase assays were based on inhibition of fibrinogen or vitronectin binding to isolated human αVβ3or αVβ5 integrins, respectively, in a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format. αVβ3 and αVβ5were purified by a three-step affinity chromatography from human placenta. Microtiter plates (96 wells; MaxiSorp Immuno Plate; Nunc) were coated with 25 ng of αVβ3 or αVβ5/well overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 3.5% BSA. In each well, 100 μl of a solution of 1.5 μg/ml human fibrinogen (IMCO, Stockholm, Sweden) or human vitronectin (Hoffmann-La Roche) and inhibitors (Ro 64 and Ro 66) at various concentrations in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1% BSA was incubated for at least 4 h at room temperature. After three washes, anti-human fibrinogen (Dakopatts; A0080; 1:2400) or anti-human vitronectin (BIOSOURCE; clone M2; AHE101) antibodies were added for 1 h followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG antibodies for 30 min. Absorption was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Controls with RGDS peptides or kistrin have been performed in parallel experiments. Adhesion assays were performed in 96-well plates coated with vitronectin (1 μg/well) as follows. Stable transfectants of HEK 293 cells expressing αvβ3 or αvβ5 and parental HEK 293 cells (lacking endogenous αvβ3 and αvβ5 expression but expressing αv and α5β1 integrins) were used in this study. Cells (30,000 cells/well) were allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM-0.5% BSA with 0.1 mmMnSO4. Ro 64 or Ro 66 was added in a concentration range between 0.001 and 100 μm with a log increment of 1. After two gentle washes with PBS, HEK 293 cells were fixed with a Karnovsky solution (2% paraformaldehyde-0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4), stained with a 0.1% crystal violet solution, and rinsed four times under running water. The stain retained by cells was solubilized in 0.1 ml of 2% sodium deoxycholate, and A595was measured to determine cell adhesion and determine the IC50. Under these conditions, specific blocking antibodies directed toward αvβ3 (LM609) or αvβ5 (P1F6) completely blocked adhesion onto vitronectin of β3- or β5-transfected HEK 293 cells, respectively (data not shown). The haptotactic motility experiments were performed in 12-well plates using a polyester stacking system (see Fig. 1). The assay was performed in two steps: (i) seeding of VSMCs on polyester filters coated with poly-l-lysine, and (ii) migration through the polyester stacking. Polyester (PE) filters (21-mm diameter; 11-μm pores; Lanz-Anliker, Rohrbach, Switzerland) placed into 12-well Evergreen plates (untreated; Polylabo, Strasbourg, France) were first coated for 1 min with 17 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (P-Lys) (Sigma) in PBS. Under these conditions, coating efficiency for P-Lys was determined previously to be 0.2 μg/PE. After PE drying at room temperature, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA (w/v) for 2 h at room temperature. Before seeding, PE filters were washed twice with PBS and once with DMEM-0.5% BSA and incubated for an additional 5 min at 37 °C in the last wash. VSMCs grown near confluence were detached with trypsin-EDTA, washed, resuspended in DMEM containing 0.5% BSA (Albumax; Life Technologies, Inc.), and finally plated into wells containing the P-Lys-coated PE, at 300,000 cells/ml in a final volume of 1 ml. Cell adhesion was allowed for 24 h at 37 °C. Efficiency of seeding was checked by counting the remaining nonadherent VSMCs with a cell counter (Coulter) and was determined to be 80%. Bottom PE filters with adherent cells were washed twice in DMEM-0.5% BSA and transferred into new 12-well plates containing DMEM-0.5% BSA. Migration was initiated with an overlay of the middle and top PE filters coated with human vitronectin from Life Technologies, Inc. (1 h with 3 μg/ml vitronectin in PBS followed by BSA blocking). The three PE filters were maintained in tight contact with each other by applying a monolayer of glass beads (3-mm diameter) (Fig. 1). For inhibition studies, antibodies, synthetic peptides, and small molecule antagonists were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h before overlay at appropriate concentrations established for porcine VSMCs. In some assays, 20 μm LY-294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4 H-1-benzopyran-4-one) from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA) or 50 or 100 nm wortmannin from Sigma, or U-73122 from Novabiochem (France Biochem, Meudon, France) was preincubated for 1 h with VSMCs to block PI3K IA/PI4K β or PLC activities, respectively. When inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO, the final amount of Me2SO did not exceed 0.6% (v/v). For in vivophosphoinositide labeling, cells were incubated for 4 h with 0.4 mCi/ml [32P]phosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before overlay. Migration was performed in the32P-containing medium for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified cell culture incubator. Under our experimental conditions, VSMCs were not proliferative, as determined by cell cycle distribution analysis performed by flow cytometry after staining with a propidium iodide solution (data not shown). At the end of the incubation period, all PE filters were rinsed twice in PBS, fixed in a Karnovsky solution for 5 min at 4 °C, and dried on tissue paper. Lipids were extracted following the modified procedure of Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (42842) Google Scholar) on the same PE filters used for cell migration evaluation. Control experiments were performed and showed that cell fixation before lipid extraction did not modify lipid quantification, nor was the lipid extraction detrimental to the subsequent evaluation of cell migration (data not shown). The PE filters were removed from the lipid extraction tube after the one-phase solvent extraction step and dried on tissue paper. Then, PE filters were stained in crystal violet solution for 5 min. After six washes under running water, the crystal violet staining of PE filters was dissolved by adding 500 μl/well 2% deoxycholate, microwaving for 30 s at 150 W, and shaking for 2 min. Absorbance was measured at 595 nm on 200 μl in 96-well plates using a HTS 7000 Bio Assay Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell migration was quantified by comparison of the absorbance from the middle + top PE filters (cells that migrated) to the absorbance from total cells that adhered on P-Lys (the sum of absorbances from the bottom, middle, and top PE filters). Cells that migrated on the top PE filter represented ∼30% of total cells that migrated (middle + top PE filters). Each test group was performed in at least triplicate wells. After extraction, lipids were separated by TLC on Silica Gel G plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) previously impregnated with 1% (w/v) potassium oxalate or 3% (w/v) oxalic acid in appropriate solvents: (i) to separate PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2, the elution solvent was chloroform, acetone, methanol, acetic acid, and water (80:30:26:24:16, v/v) as described by Jolles et al. (21Jolles J. Schrama L.H. Gispen W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 666: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); (ii) for PtdOH quantification, lipids were resolved by chloroform, methanol, 10 n chlorhydric acid (87:13:0.5, v/v) according to Cohen et al. (22Cohen P. Broekman M.J. Verkley A. Lisman J.W. Derksen A. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 762-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); (iii) to separate phosphatidylinositol 3′,4′-bisphosphate, lipid extracts were developed twice for 2 h in chloroform, methanol, 9.15 m ammoniac (40:40:15, v/v) following the procedure established by Pignataro and Ascoli (23Pignataro O.P. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1718-1723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (iv) to separate PtdIns-3-P and PtdIns-4-P, the procedure of Walsh et al. (24Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was used, and lipids on trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N, N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-impregnated silica gel plates were separated by methanol, chloroform, pyridine, water, and 88% formic acid (75:60:45:7.5:3, v/v) supplemented with 12 g of boric acid. The plates were run up to the top for 3 h. In some experiments, the spot of PtdIns obtained with the elution solvent chloroform/methanol/3 m ammonium hydroxyde (90:70:20, v/v) was scraped off, solubilized, and further run with the solvent described by Walsh et al. (24Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Individual lanes containing commercial standards of PtdOH, PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P, or PtdIns-4,5-P2 were stained with iodine vapors or with zinzade spraying. The radioactive spots were visualized and quantified by a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics) after a 2-day exposure. In some experiments, whole lipid extracts were deacetylated by methylamine treatment, separated by high pressure liquid chromatography, and quantified by on line radioactivity detection (25Heraud J.M. Racaud-Sultan C. Gironcel D. Albiges-Rizo C. Giacomini T. Roques S. Martel V. Breton-Douillon M. Perret B. Chap H. J. Biol.

For p85 immunoprecipitates, 1.4–2 × 106VSMCs were lysed with 1.5 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). For Pyk2 immunoprecipitates, 1.4–9 × 106VSMCs were lysed in 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. For PI4K β immunoprecipitates, 500 μl of cold lysis buffer (0.3 mNaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 500 μmNa3VO4, 200 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm NaF, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) was added on 1.4 × 106 VSMCs. Lysates were clarified by using a 10-min centrifugation at 8000 × g at 4 °C. 3 volumes of equilibration buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and dithiothreitol and inhibitors as indicated above) was added on PI4K β immunoprecipitates. Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated overnight with anti-p85 antibodies (0.5 μg/ml), anti-Pyk2 antibodies (2.5 μl/ml), or anti-PI4K β antibodies (1 μl/ml). After capture by protein A-Sepharose beads and three washes, one-half of the immunocomplexes were tested for in vitro PI kinase activity, and the other half was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with relevant antibodies. p85 and Pyk2 immunoprecipitates were suspended in PI kinase activity buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus 50 μm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated with PtdIns (30 μg)/phosphatidylserine (60 μg) vesicles and 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking, according to Whitman et al. (26Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Protein A beads associated with PI4K β were incubated in a 50-μl final volume containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 and 0.3% Triton X-100 plus 50 μm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 and in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml sonicated PtdIns and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 37 °C with shaking (27Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated by TLC, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Equal amounts of lysates from migrating or nonmigrating VSMCs (1.4 × 106cells) were subjected to immunoprecipitations with antisera against Pyk2. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, and 5 mmMgCl2). One-half of the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-Pyk2 antibodies, whereas the other half were incubated with 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μg of poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) and 40 μm ATP including 15 μCi of [32P]ATP for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, sample was boiled for 2 min, and products were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 24 × 106VSMCs in culture were washed twice with PBS without Ca2+and Mg2+ and lysed in modified RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by a 10-min centrifugation at 8000 × g at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-Pyk2 antibodies (2.5 μl/ml) or anti-PI4K β antibodies (1 μl/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C with shaking. Pyk2 and PI4K β immunoprecipitates were washed twice with modified RIPA buffer, once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and once with a protein kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmMnCl2, pH 7.4). The beads were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μl of 100 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and further incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking. Immune complexes were dissociated by the addition of 100 μl of 2× elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). After a 5-min centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant volume was adjusted to 1.5 ml by the addition of modified RIPA buffer. Anti-PI4K β or anti-Pyk2 antibodies, respectively, were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. After capture by protein A-Sepharose beads and three washes in modified RIPA buffer, immunocomplexes were dissolved in sample buffer, heated at 100 °C for 2 min, and resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized by autoradiography on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). VSMCs in DMEM-0.5% BSA were seeded on glass coverslips coated with vitronectin (3 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of αvβ3 small molecule antagonist (Ro 66) or anti-αvβ5 blocking antibody (P1F6). In some experiments, VSMCs were pretreated with LY-294002 (20 μm) or U-73122 (2 μm) for 1 h to block the integrin-dependent signaling pathways. Adhesion was allowed for 4 h at 37 °C, and morphological changes were directly microphotographed with a microscope. Expression of αvβ3 and αvβ5integrins in cultured human or porcine VSMCs has already been demonstrated (17Liaw L. Skinner M.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 713-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Interaction of VSMC αvβ3 and αvβ5integrins with their natural ligand, vitronectin, was then demonstrated in human atheromatous plaque (29Dufourcq P. Louis H. Moreau C. Daret D. Boisseau M.R. Lamaziere J.M. Bonnet J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the respective roles of both αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors in VSMC migration on vitronectin have not yet been elucidated. Under our experimental conditions, serum-deprived porcine VSMCs efficiently migrated on a vitronectin matrix (Fig. 2). VSMC migration was significantly detectable as early as 3 h after overlay of vitronectin-coated polyesters. To evaluate the importance of each integrin in our migration system, we used both specific blocking antibodies and RGD analog compounds from Hoffmann- La Roche, the functional characteristics of which are shown in Table I. Whereas the Hoffmann-La Roche compound Ro 64 blocked both integrins αVβ3 and αvβ5, Ro 66 was specifically directed against αVβ3. Anti-αVβ3 activity in both solid phase and adhesion assays showed that the IC50 values for Ro 66 were 10–20 times greater than the IC50 values for Ro 64. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3 A,a maximal inhibition of VSMC migration was obtained at 10 μm Ro 64 and near 700 μm Ro 66. Thus, in VSMC migration inhibitory studies, 30 μm Ro 64 and 650 μm Ro 66 were used to be equally potent on αVβ3 blockade. In VSMCs, blockade of αVβ3 function by the specific antibody LM609 inhibited cell migration by 20% after 24 h (Fig. 3 B). Ro 66 inhibited VSMC migration by 34% (Fig. 3 B). Blockade of αVβ5 by the specific antibody P1F6 also decreased VSMC migration by ∼35% (Fig. 3 B). When LM609 + P1F6, P1F6 + Ro 66, or Ro 64 alone was applied on VSMCs, inhibition of cell migration was more efficient than blockade of each separate integrin (Fig. 3 B). The peptide GpenGRGDSPCA (penRGD), which blocked both αVβ3 and αVβ5integrins, induced also a strong inhibition of VSMC migration, whereas the control peptide GRGESP (RGE) was inefficient (Fig. 3 B).Table ICharacterization of αvβ3 and αvβ5 antagonists Ro 64 and Ro 66HumanSolid phase assay IC50Adhesion assay (HEK 293) IC50nmnmαvβ3αvβ5αIIbβ3αvβ3αvβ5α5β1Ro 640.10.6>100,0008495500Ro 661.355000>100,0001800232,000597,000Roche products Ro 64 and Ro 66 were characterized by solid phase assays and adhesion assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For solid phase assays, inhibition of fibrinogen or vitronectin binding to isolated human αvβ3 or αvβ5 integrins, respectively, was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the presence or absence of Ro 64 or Ro 66 compounds. For adhesion assays, stable transfectants of HEK 293 cells (expressing αvβ3 or αvβ5) and parental HEK 293 cells (expressing α5β1) were allowed to adhere on vitronectin or fibronectin, respectively, in DMEM-0.5% BSA and in the presence or absence of Ro 64 or Ro 66. Then, adherent HEK cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and absorbance was measured for cell adhesion evaluation and IC50 determination.

We compared the effects of apoE added to media (exogenous apoE) with the effects of stably expressed apoE (endogenous apoE) on cell proliferation. Exogenous and endogenous apoE increased population doubling times by 30–50% over a period of 14 days by prolonging the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Exogenous and endogenous apoE also decreased serum-stimulated DNA synthesis by 30–50%. However, apoE did not cause cell cycle arrest; both apoE-treated and control cells achieved equivalent saturation densities at 14 days. Further analyses demonstrated that exogenous and endogenous apoE prevented activation of MAPK but not induction of c-fosexpression in response to serum growth factors. Endogenous (but not exogenous) apoE altered serum concentration-dependent effects on proliferation. Whereas control (non-apoE-expressing) cell numbers increased with increasing serum concentrations (1.6-fold for every 2-fold increase in serum), apoE-expressing cell numbers did not differ as serum levels were raised from 2.5 to 10%. In addition, in low serum (0.1%), apoE-expressing cells had elevated DNA synthesis levels compared with control cells.

ApoE can reach cells from two sources: exogenous apoE (defined as apoE synthesized or provided by a remote source such as plasma apoE or apoE added to experimental media), usually as a component of lipoproteins, or endogenous apoE (defined as apoE produced by cellular apoE gene expression). Since apoE binds to lipids and other molecules (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar, 3Lin C.Y. Lucas M. Mazzone T. J.

Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exogenous apoE and endogenous apoE can potentially encounter and interact with different groups of molecules in the extracellular environment compared with the intracellular environment. For example, exogenous apoE binds to cell-surface apoE receptors and mediates endocytosis, whereas endogenous apoE is mainly associated with Golgi compartments (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar, 12Dahan S. Ahluwalia J.P. Wong L. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that following endogenous synthesis, apoE has different effects on cell function compared with apoE entering cells from the extracellular environment. In macrophages, exogenous apoE is much less effective than endogenous apoE in promoting cholesterol efflux (7Mazzone T. Reardon C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1345-1353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Granot E. Eisenberg S. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 114: 115-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although exogenous apoE and endogenous apoE are capable of interacting with cells differently, they both can bind the same cell-surface components such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (3Lin C.Y. Lucas M. Mazzone T. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby exerting similar biological effects. Exogenous apoE affects the proliferation of various cell types (4Vogel T. Guo N. Guy R. Drezlich N. Krutzsch H.C. Blake D.A. Panet A. Roberts D.D. J. Cell.

Cell proliferation is controlled by protein kinase-based signaling pathways linking cell-surface mitogen receptors with various targets within the cell, including critical transcription regulators. Exogenous apoE has been shown to affect the activities of several protein kinases known to be involved in transmitting mitogenic stimuli, including protein kinases A and C and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (6Ishigami M. Swertfeger D.K. Granholm N.A. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20156-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On the other hand, endogenous apoE expression is controlled by growth state (14Majack R.A Castle C.K. Goodman L.V. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Shooter E.M. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. J.

The question of whether exogenous apoE and endogenous apoE have similar effects on cell proliferation or differentiation has not been addressed directly in the same cell type. Previous studies have examined the inhibitory effects of exogenous apoE on short-term cell proliferative responses in the presence of serum stimuli (4Vogel T. Guo N. Guy R. Drezlich N. Krutzsch H.C.

In this study, we determined the effects of exogenous apoE and endogenous apoE on cell proliferation under conditions of both serum deprivation and serum stimulation. To compare the effects of exogenous apoE and endogenous apoE on proliferation in the same cell type, we stably expressed apoE in a rat fibroblast cell line (F111 cells) that normally does not express apoE. The proliferation properties of parental F111 cells have been previously characterized in detail (19Talmage D.A. Lackey R.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1837-1845PubMed Google Scholar, 20Talmage D.A. Riney C.

Cells expressing the apoE transgene were defined as E+ cells, in contrast to E− cells carrying only the control plasmid (encoding hygromycin resistance). Responses of cells to serum were determined in the presence or absence of exogenous apoE. Our results indicate that although exogenous apoE and endogenous apoE exhibit similar effects on cell proliferation at a fixed serum concentration, cell proliferative responses to apoE differ dramatically under serum-deprived versus serum-stimulated conditions. Purified lipid-free apoE was used for experiments. [3H]Thymidine and ECL Western blotting reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [32P]dCTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. High-glucose (4.5 mg/ml) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was obtained from Cellgro (carried by Fisher). Calf serum was obtained from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine mixture (100×: 10,000 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 29.2 mg/mll-glutamine, and 10 mm sodium citrate in 0.14% NaOH) and trypsin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), diethyl pyrocarbonate, and CsCl2 were purchased from Sigma. Hygromycin B was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal anti-MAPK and monoclonal anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-apoE antibody E10 was a generous gift from Drs. E. Krul and G. Schonfield (University of Washington). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and New England Biolabs Inc. An apoE expression vector in which the human apoE3 cDNA is expressed from the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter was a generous gift from Dr. T. Mazzone (University of Chicago) (33Mazzone T. Pustelnikas L. Reardon C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1081-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hygromycin resistance gene cloned into the plasmid pβhygro was regulated by the rat actin promoter (34Khuri F.R. Cho Y. Talmage D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 595-602PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into competent Escherichia coli strain DH5 and purified on QIAGEN columns or by CsCl2/EtBr banding (35Radloff R. Bauer W. Vinograd J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1514-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Rat F111 embryonic fibroblasts were maintained in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. ApoE-expressing cell lines were generated by cotransfecting F111 fibroblasts with the apoE3 expression vector and pβhygro using calcium phosphate-mediated DNA precipitation (36Chen C. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Control cell lines were generated in parallel by transfecting the parental cells with pβhygro alone. Hygromycin-resistant cells were selected for 1 week in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin and then maintained in the same medium with reduced hygromycin concentrations (100 μg/ml). Three apoE-expressing (E+) and three control (E−) clones were expanded into cell lines and used for experiments. Similar results were obtained with each clone. For detection of apoE synthesis and secretion, cells (60% confluence) were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium. Both the conditioned medium (concentrated by Amicon Centriprep concentrators, molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 Da) and whole cell extracts (following lysis in 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) were resolved by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes. ApoE was detected by incubating membranes with the monoclonal anti-human apoE antibody (E10, 1:2000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) nonfat milk, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide). Bound primary antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibodies and ECL reactions (37Seitz W.R. Clin. Biochem. 1984; 17: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine MAPK activity, cell extracts were resolved electrophoretically on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to membranes that were probed with primary antibodies specific to MAPK (1:2000 dilution) or phosphorylated MAPK (1:2000 dilution), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and ECL reactions for the detection of total and activated MAPK levels. Cell morphology was examined under an Olympus CK2 inverted microscope, and images were recorded by an Olympus C-35-AD-4 camera. The differential interference contrast images were taken under magnification × 100. For experiments aimed to identify the Golgi regions, cells maintained in coverslip bottom dishes were fixed and incubated with 10 mmNBD-C6 dissolved in DMEM containing 0.68 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C and submitted for imaging analysis. For identifying the intracellular neutral lipid, cells in coverslip bottom dishes were incubated with 100 ng/ml Nile red and observed immediately. For apoE immunostaining, cells in coverslip bottom dishes were fixed for 30 min with 2% formaldehyde and then washed four times with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with saponin (5% calf serum, 500 μg/ml saponin, and 20 mm glycine in PBS) for 20 min. Prior to incubation, the anti-apoE antibody was pre-absorbed with E− cell protein extracts to reduce nonspecific binding. ApoE immunodetection was performed as follows: 1) monoclonal anti-apoE primary antibody E10 (1:200 dilution) incubation (1 h); 2) three washes with 5% calf serum and 500 μg/ml saponin in PBS (5 min/wash); 3) rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:500 dilution in 5% calf serum and 500 μg/ml saponin in PBS) incubation (1 h); and 4) two washes with 5% calf serum and 500 μg/ml saponin in PBS (5 min/wash) and one wash with PBS (10 min). For actin staining, formaldehyde-fixed cells were extracted by acetone (−20 °C, 3–5 min), followed by two PBS washes and a 25-min incubation in PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin blocking solution. Cells were then stained with actin-BODIPY FL phallacidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 1:40 dilution in PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM410 confocal laser scanning system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV inverted microscope. For observation of fluorescence signals based on the excitation/emission wavelengths of the dyes (rhodamine, 570/590 nm; Nile red, 552/636 nm; NBD-C6, 466/536 nm; and phallacidin, 505/512 nm), appropriate combinations of excitation laser and emission filter settings were used. Images were recorded with a Pentium PC computer with Zeiss LSM software for image enhancement and analysis. Cells (500/well) were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY), and cell number was determined from days 3 to 14. Media (with or without apoE) were changed every 3 days throughout the course of the experiments. For cells incubated with exogenous apoE, 10 μg/ml purified lipid-free apoE was added at every media change (every 3 days). At the indicated time points, cells were trypsinized and detached from the plates, and cell number was counted using a hemocytometer. Results represent three parallel experiments. 105cells suspended in 50 μl of PBS with 3% calf serum were mixed with 1 ml of 80% ethanol and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide and 0.6% Nonidet P-40, followed by incubation with 500 μl of 2 mg/ml RNase A at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. For experiments measuring DNA synthesis, 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to the experimental medium and incubated with cells for 40 h to label the newly synthesized DNA. At the end of the incubation, cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cell macromolecules including DNA were precipitated for 1 h with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Cell precipitates were washed twice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid to remove free [3H]thymidine and then dissolved in 1 n NaOH (37 °C, 2 h). Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Experiments were repeated three times, and similar results were obtained. Cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in the growth medium overnight. After experimental treatments (2.5% calf serum ± 10 μg/ml apoE), cells were washed twice at room temperature with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated PBS and then harvested in Trizol reagent (3 ml/dish; Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at A260. RNA (10 μg/lane) was dissolved in water and ethidium bromide-containing sample buffer (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), followed by boiling in a water bath for 5 min. Samples were loaded and resolved on 1.2% agarose gels (containing 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm acetate, and 1.1m formaldehyde) for 4 h at 100 V. After electrophoresis, the gels were examined under UV light to ensure equivalent RNA loading and integrity. Gels were then gently washed at room temperature with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water for 30 min to remove ethidium bromide. RNA samples on gels were transferred to nylon membranes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in 10× SSC (1.5m NaCl and 0.15 m trisodium citrate-2H2O, pH 7.0) overnight. The membranes were then irradiated with UV light (1200 J) to cross-link the RNA to the membrane. 32P-Labeled DNA probes were prepared by the random priming method (38Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) using [α-32P]dCTP. Nylon membranes were prehybridized for 15 min and hybridized to radioactively labeled c-fos or L30 probes for 1 h at 65 °C in QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were washed twice (15 min/wash) with 2× SSC containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature and with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min. Dried membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with intensifying screens at −70 °C. Hybridization intensities were quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The intensity of the c-fos mRNA signal was normalized for possible differences in mRNA loading or transfer by dividing its value by the intensity of the L30 ribosomal protein mRNA. Unpaired t tests were performed to test the differences between the groups (with exogenous apoE versus without exogenous apoE or E− cellsversus E+ cells). A significance of difference was determined at the p < 0.05 level. To compare the effects of exogenous apoE added to cells via the culture medium with the effects of endogenous apoE (synthesized in and secreted from cells), we established stably transfected derivatives of the rat F111 embryonic fibroblast cell line. Multiple clones were isolated that expressed either apoE and hygromycin resistance (referred to as E+ cells) or hygromycin resistance only (referred to as E− cells). We confirmed that E+ cells synthesized and secreted apoE by immunoblot analyses of whole cell extracts and concentrated conditioned medium from these clones (Fig.1 A) and by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 1 B). E+ cells synthesized and secreted an ∼34-kDa protein that comigrated with purified apoE. Based on the signal intensities of apoE standards obtained in these immunoblots, we estimate that E+ cells secrete ∼40 ng of apoE/106 cells/day and contain ∼25 ng of intracellular apoE/mg of total cell protein. No apoE, either intracellular or secreted, was detected in E− cell cultures. Although E+ cells clearly secrete apoE, cell-associated apoE was not localized with the Golgi apparatus (Fig.1, B and C). It is also noteworthy that little apoE was detected at the cell surface (Fig. 1 B). Interesting morphological changes were observed in E+cells. Compared with E− cells (Fig.2 A), E+ cells (Fig. 2 C) had shorter cell bodies, resulting in a more oval shape, as well as less distinct nuclear boundaries when viewed by phase-contrast microscopy and a prominent perinuclear accumulation of phase-bright vesicles. Despite the above changes, similar to E− cells (Fig. 2 B), E+ cells maintained a prominent actin filament network (Fig. 2 D). In E+ cells (Fig. 2 G), the perinuclear accumulation and increase in size of phase-bright vesicles relative to similar vesicles in E− cells (Fig. 2 E) were more apparent when viewed by differential interference contrast microscopy. In E− (Fig. 2, E and F) and E+ (G and H) cells, these vesicles were not co-localized with the Golgi apparatus. However, these vesicles did stain positive with Nile red (data not shown), indicating the presence of neutral lipid. Despite the apparent formation of larger lipid-containing vesicles or droplets in E+ cells, there was no measurable difference in whole cell lipid content (triglyceride and cholesterol ester) between E+ and E− cells (data not shown). The same morphological changes were seen in each of three independent E+ clonal isolates, but were never seen in E−cells exposed to 10 μg/ml exogenous apoE, even after prolonged periods (up to 14 days). Thus, the presence of apoE within these fibroblasts had substantial effects on cellular architecture that could not be mimicked by exposure to exogenous apoE. To determine whether apoE (both exogenous and endogenous) has a sustained effect on cell proliferation, we compared the proliferation rate of E−cells, in the presence or absence of exogenous apoE, with that of E+ cells over a period of 14 days (Fig.3). Cells that expressed apoE had significantly slower proliferation rates during mid-to-late log growth (days 5–11) (Fig. 3 A). Very similar results were seen when exogenous apoE was added to the growth medium of E− cells (data not shown). In both cases, apoE increased population doubling times by 30–50%, resulting in a 4–7-fold reduction in cell number on days 5 and 7 (Fig. 3 B). Despite the reduction in proliferation rates by day 14, the cell densities of apoE-exposed cultures were equal to the saturation density of cultures not exposed to apoE. Therefore, apoE expression or addition to the culture medium did not arrest cell proliferation. The increased population doubling time of apoE-exposed cells was associated with a prolongation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. E− and E+ cells were fixed, and their DNAs were stained with propidium iodide 48 h after replating. Note that plating densities for this experiment were considerably higher than in the extended proliferation assays. As a result, by 48 h, cell populations were in early-to-mid log growth. Relative DNA content was quantified by flow cytometry (Fig. 3 C). At 48 h post-plating, 70% of E− cells had a 2N DNA content (and thus were in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle), 18% had a 4N DNA content (G2/M phase), and 12% had DNA levels intermediate between 2N and 4N (cells in S phase). In contrast, 85% of the E+ cells were in G0/G1, with compensatory decreases in the number of cells in S phase (from 12 to 10%) and G2/M (from 18 to 5%; p < 0.05). There were few cells in either population with less than 2N DNA levels, indicating that apoE expression did not increase apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Prolongation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle is frequently associated with decreased responsiveness to mitogens. Indeed, several investigators have demonstrated that exogenous apoE inhibits short-term proliferative responses to mitogens of endothelial cells, Kaposi's sarcoma cells, and smooth muscle cells (4Vogel T.

To see whether exogenous apoE and endogenous apoE decreased F111 cell responsiveness to serum mitogens, we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation into E− cells, into E+ cells, and into E− cells treated with exogenous apoE. Cells were arrested in G0 by serum starvation (0.1% calf serum for 48 h) and grown in 0.1 or 10% calf serum and 1 μC/ml [3H]thymidine with or without exogenous apoE (10 μg/ml) for 40 h, and incorporation of [3H]thymidine was quantified. The results of these experiments uncovered two effects of apoE. First, total incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA and the -fold induction of [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to serum were significantly reduced by apoE (Fig. 4). Serum stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into E− cells by 25-fold. Exogenous apoE reduced the serum response of E−cells so that [3H]thymidine incorporation increased by only 7-fold. Serum treatment had modest effects on E+cells, increasing [3H]thymidine incorporation by 4-fold. Second, in the presence of apoE (and in particular, endogenous apoE), serum-starved cells continued to incorporate [3H]thymidine into DNA. As a result, despite the pronounced decreases in -fold stimulation in response to serum treatment, apoE decreased overall thymidine incorporation only by 30% (exogenous apoE) or by 50% (endogenous apoE). Taken together with the previous data on population doubling times and cell cycle phase distribution, we conclude that apoE reduces (but does not eliminate) the ability of serum growth factors to drive progression of cells through G1. Among the major mitogens present in serum are peptide growth factors that are ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, in particular, the potent fibroblast mitogen platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Numerous studies have established that growth factors drive G1progression by activating cytosolic and nuclear protein kinases that subsequently activate specific transcription factors. Key targets include the p42 and p44 MAPKs and the c-fos proto-oncogene (39De Vivo M. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19671-19674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Thommes K.B.

Jaedieu P. Chang L. Lai G. Terrell T.G. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 347-356PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these growth factors and cytokines, adrenergic agonists can act as co-mitogens of rat hepatocytes; α1-adrenergic receptors were reported to be involved in the proliferation of rat hepatocytes in vitro (12Cruise J.L. Houck K.A. Michalopoulos G., K. Science. 1985; 227: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 13Kajiyama Y. Ui M.

Hepatology. 1987; 7: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Norepinephrine (NE) enhances DNA synthesis in rat-cultured hepatocytes in the presence of EGF and insulin, and injection of the α1 antagonist, prazosin, attenuates the [3H]thymidine incorporation in the rat regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy. In addition to co-mitogenic action, NE was shown to reduce TGFβ- and activin A-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of rat hepatocytes in culture (15Houck K.A. Cruise J.L. Michalopoulos G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 135: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y.Q. Kanzaki M. Mashima H. Mine T. Kojima I. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 288-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the precise mechanism underlying the reduction is not well understood. Smad proteins are a group of recently identified molecules that function as intracellular signaling mediators and modulators of TGF-β family members (17Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar, 18Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). Smad proteins are involved in TGF-β and activin-induced growth inhibitions in many cell systems. Smads can be classified into three groups: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common mediator Smads (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads). Upon the binding of a ligand to a type II receptor, type II receptor kinases phosphorylate the GS domain of type I receptors, leading to activation of the type I receptor. The activated type I receptor kinases phosphorylate R-Smads differentially at two serine residues in the SSXS motif at their extreme C termini (19Macı́as-Silvia M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 20Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). R-Smads include Smad1, -2, -3, -5 and -8. Smad1 and -5 mediate the signaling of bone morphogenetic protein 2 and 4, Smad2 and -3 mediate the signaling of TGF-β and activins, and Smad8 mediates the signaling of ALK-2 receptor kinases. The phosphorylated R-Smads form oligomeric complexes with a Co-Smad, Smad4; the complexes then translocate into the nucleus. These complexes then activate the transcription of target genes. I-Smads Smad6 and Smad7) act in opposition to the signal-transducing R- and Co-Smads by forming stable associations with activated type-I receptors and thus preventing the phosphorylation of R-Smads (21Imamura T.

Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), have been recently reported. However, signaling pathways from G protein-coupled receptors to those of TGF-β family members are poorly defined. In this study, we examined how NE inhibits activin A-induced growth inhibition of rat hepatocytes. We demonstrate that NE inhibits activin A-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad proteins. We also show that NE induces the expression of an anti-Smad, Smad7. Overexpression of Smad7 enhances EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis and abolishes the growth inhibitory effects of activin A. We also demonstrate that the induction of Smad7 by NE is dependent on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Recombinant human activin A was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Eto, Ajinomoto, Inc. (Kawasaki, Japan). Norepinephrine and mouse EGF were purchased from Sigma. [3H]Thymidine (25 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Anti-Smad2/3, anti-Smad4, anti-NF-κB p65 and anti-IκBα antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat Smad6 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kato (Fukushima Medical College), and AdSmad7 adenovirus was kindly provided by Dr. Miyazono (Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research). Ad5IkB adenovirus was kindly provided by Drs. Y. Iimuro (Hyogo Medical Collage) and D. A. Brenner (Univ. of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). Smad7 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. P. ten Dijke (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). Rat hepatocytes obtained from male Wistar rats (170–200 g) were used. Rat parenchymal liver cells were prepared by the method of Berry and Friend (26Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on a collagen-coated dish in William's E medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 1 nmol/liter insulin, 10 nmol/liter dexamethasone, streptomycin, and penicillin. The cells were allowed to attach for 3 h, and then the medium was changed to serum-free William's E medium containing 1 nmol/liter insulin, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 10 nmol/liter dexamethasone, streptomycin, and penicillin. All of the culture incubations were carried out at 37 °C under a humidified condition of 95% air and 5% CO2. In all subsequent experiments, primary hepatocytes were infected with recombinant adenovirus 2 h after plating at a dose of 10–50 plaque-forming units per cell in hormonally defined media. After 1 h, the medium was changed. Since α1-adrenergic receptor is reported to be dominant during first 0–8 h in rat cultured hepatocytes (27Kajiyama Y. Ui M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we harvested the cells 5 h after infection with Ad5IκB. DNA synthesis was assessed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. [3H]Thymidine was added to the culture medium from 48 to 72 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured as described by McNiel et al. (28McNiel P.L. McKenna Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As previously reported (9Yasuda H. Mine T. Shibata H. Eto Y. Hasegawa Y. Takeuchi T. Asano S. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), activin A completely inhibits DNA synthesis between 0–36 h after plating, and we added activin A at 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from cultured hepatocytes using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNase protection assay was performed using the RPA II kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As templates, we used the 306-base pair fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1183–1488 of rat Smad6 cDNA and the 154-base pair fragment corresponding to nucleotides 999–1152 of rat Smad7 cDNA (GenBank™ AF042499). Ten μg of total RNA was allowed to hybridize with 5 × 105 cpm per each32P-labeled riboprobe at 45 °C for 16 h, followed by digestion with RNase A and RNase T1 at 37 °C. The resultant protected hybrids were isolated by ethanol precipitation and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide/8 m urea denaturing gel. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak XAR-2 film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester NY) at −80 °C to an autoradiogram. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 100 units/ml aprotinin. Proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Visualization was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rat hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips at a density of 2 × 104 cells/35 mm. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and incubated sequentially with Blocking Ace (Yukijirushi Co., Tokyo, Japan). The cells were then incubated with anti-Smad2/3 antibody (Santa-Cruz) at room temperature for 60 min, extensively rinsed with PBS, and exposed to secondary fluorescent antibody at room temperature for 60 min. The samples were examined with a Nikon E-600 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured and digitized using a Spot CCD camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Sterling Height, MI). Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). After the appropriate treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF). After 15 min, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%. Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm PMSF). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were transferred to new vials. The protein concentration of the extract was measured using a Bio-Rad Protein Determination kit (Hercules, CA). Double-strand NF-κB oligonucleotides (Promega, Madison, WI) were32P-end labeled using 3000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The probe was incubated with 10 μg of the nuclear protein along with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in each reaction for 30 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 8% glycerol, 0.1 mmPMSF, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. For the antibody supershift assay, 2 μg of NF-κB p65 antibody (Santa Cruz) was added to the samples 30 min before incubation with the labeled probe, and all samples were further incubated at room temperature for 30 min before electrophoresis. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gel, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The experiments presented under “Results” are representative of three or more similar experiments. The results were expressed as means ± S.D., and statistical analysis was carried out using Student'st test for paired data. Differences at p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. NE is a co-mitogen of hepatocyte proliferation. Activin A potently inhibits the growth of primary cultured rat hepatocytes (9Yasuda H. Mine T. Shibata H. Eto Y. Hasegawa Y. Takeuchi T. Asano S. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that NE reverses the effect of activin A on DNA synthesis (16Zhang Y.Q. Kanzaki M. Mashima H. Mine T. Kojima I. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 288-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with previous data, NE significantly enhanced EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes (Fig.1 A). Activin A inhibited EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of NE 24 h prior to the addition of activin A to the culture medium nearly completely reversed the growth inhibitory effect of activin A (Fig.1 B). Next, we examined whether NE interferes with activin A/Smad signaling by preventing the nuclear translocation of Smad2/3. Most untreated rat hepatocytes showed granular cytoplasmic staining for Smad2/3, and only nuclear bodies were stained in their nuclei (Fig. 2 A, a; 14% of cells showed nuclear staining). After exposure to activin A alone for 30 min, nuclear staining of Smad2/3 was exclusively detectable in 90% of the cells (Fig. 2 A, c). In contrast, incubation with NE alone had no significant effect on the subcellular localization of Smad2/3 (Fig. 2 A, b; 12% of cells showed nuclear staining). The addition of NE 24 h prior to adding activin A suppressed the activin A-induced nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 in rat hepatocytes (Fig. 2 A, d; 28% of the cells showed nuclear staining). We also examined the level of activin A-induced Smad4 nuclear localization by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 B). In the activin A-treated cells, an increase in Smad4 nuclear localization was observed. When the cells were treated with NE 24 h prior to adding activin A, the accumulation of nuclear Smad4 was markedly reduced. Thus, NE treatment modulated an early event in the activin A/Smad signaling pathway. Down-regulation of TGF-β signaling is affected, in part, by a feedback mechanism involving induction of expression of the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7 (21Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 22Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W.

Tahashi Y. Matsushita M. Sugano Y. Yamashiki N. et al.Hepatology. 2000; 32: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interferon (IFN)-γ was recently shown to inhibit TGF-β/Smad signaling through induction of Smad7 expression (32Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). We reasoned, therefore, that Smad6 or Smad7 may play a role in the NE-induced suppression of activin A/Smad signaling. As shown in Fig. 3, NE treatment increased the mRNA level of Smad7 in rat hepatocytes. This increase was observed within 1 h and reached a maximum level at 3 h of exposure. However, NE did not affect the expression of Smad6, another anti-Smad (data not shown). To examine whether Smad7 expression by itself could inhibit activin A-induced growth inhibition, we infected rat hepatocytes with an adenovirus expressing Smad7 (AdSmad7). We used an adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (AdLacZ) as an infection control. We determined the infection efficiency by in situstaining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). At a multiplicity of infection of 10, we found that more than 95% of the AdLacZ-infected rat hepatocytes expressed β-gal (data not shown). Northern blot analysis showed that while the AdLacZ-infected cells expressed an undetectable level of Smad7 mRNA, the AdSmad7-infected cells showed increased expression of Smad7 mRNA (Fig.4 A). To evaluate the effect of overexpression of Smad7 on activin A/Smad signaling in rat hepatocytes, we examined the level of activin A-induced Smad2/3 nuclear localization. Without activin treatment, both the AdLacZ-infected cells (Fig. 4 B, a) and AdSmad7-infected cells (Fig. 4 B, b) showed granular cytoplasmic staining for Smad2/3. In the AdLacZ-infected cells, activin A treatment led to an increase in Smad2/3 nuclear localization (Fig. 4 B, c; 92% of the cells showed nuclear staining). In the AdSmad7-infected cells, the accumulation of nuclear Smad2/3 in response to activin A was markedly diminished (Fig. 4 B, d; 22% of the cells showed nuclear staining). Thus, overexpression of Smad7 inhibited an initial event in the activin A/Smad signaling pathway. We then investigated the effect of Smad7 overexpression on the proliferation of hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 5 A, infection of AdSmad7 significantly enhanced EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes compared with that in the AdLacZ-infected cells. Although the AdLacZ-infected cells exhibited potent growth inhibition in response to treatment with activin A, the growth inhibitory effect of activin A was nearly abolished in the AdSmad7-infected cells (Fig.5 B). Smad7 overexpression seems to be sufficient to mimic the NE-mediated enhancement of EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis and inhibition of activin A-induced growth inhibition of rat hepatocytes.Figure 5A, effect of overexpression of Smad7 or LacZ on DNA synthesis in primary culture of rat hepatocytes.

In addition to cytokines such as TNFα and IFNβ, several agonists working through G protein-coupled receptors can activate NF-κB (34Cowen D.S. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. Mol.

We examined whether NE treatment increased NF-κB binding activity, as assessed by EMSA. As shown in Fig.6, the amount of active NF-κB complex increased upon NE treatment for 30 min or 1 h in comparison with that before treatment. Competition with 100× molar excess of cold NF-κB probe confirmed the specificity. The NF-κB complex contained p65, as demonstrated by the supershift with p65-specific antibody. We then investigated the effect of the NF-κB pathway inhibitor,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) that prevents the degradation of IκB, on the induction of Smad7 expression by NE. As shown in Fig.7 A, NF-κB binding was nearly completely abolished in the presence of TPCK. We next performed RNase protection analysis to determine the effect of TPCK on the induction of Smad7 expression by NE. Rat hepatocytes were preincubated in the presence or absence of TPCK before the addition of NE. As shown in Fig.7 B, NE-induced Smad7 expression was inhibited in the presence of TPCK. We further evaluated the role of NF-κB on NE-induced Smad7 expression using an adenovirus expressing an IκB super-repressor that contained serine-to-alanine mutations in residues 32 and 36 (43). Using an anti-IκBα antibody, the HA-tagged IκBα was identified by its slower mobility compared with the endogenous IκB by Western blotting (Fig.8 A). As shown in Fig.8 B, induction of NF-κB DNA binding by NE was markedly abolished by prior infection with Ad5IκB. As shown in Fig.8 C, NE-induced Smad7 expression was inhibited by prior infection with Ad5IκB. These results strongly suggested that NE induced Smad7 expression through an NF-κB-dependent pathway in rat hepatocytes.Figure 7A, effect of NF-κB inhibitor on NE-induced NE-κB DNA binding in rat hepatocytes.

Our results suggest that activation of NF-κB by NE induces inhibitory Smad7 expression. Overexpression of exogenous Smad7 abrogated activin-induced growth inhibition. Smad7 was originally identified as a shear stress-inducible gene in endothelial cells (44Topper J.N. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K.R. Xu Y.Y. Deeds J.D. Feeley R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subsequently, it was found that its expression can be induced by TGFβ or activin itself, and Smad7 is therefore postulated to be a mediator that participates in a negative feedback loop. Accordingly, ectopic expression of Smad7 inhibited the TGF-β- and activin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of various cell lines including hepatoma cells (30Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Nakao A.

Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), TNF-α (33, and CD40 stimulation (45Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol.

Together with our finding presented here, control of Smad7 expression seems to provide a general mechanism as a physiological molecular switch to suppress TGFβ/activin activity. NE may play a particularly important role in hepatocyte proliferation. NE enhances the mitogenic effects of various growth stimulators of rat hepatocytes (3Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2853) Google Scholar). In partially hepatectomized rats, the plasma NE level increases as early as 2 h after surgery and remains elevated for 2 days. Surgical hepatic denervation or injection of an α1 antagonist, prazosin, reduced the [3H]thymidine incorporation in the rat regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy (14Cruise J.L. Knechtle S.J. Bollinger R.R. Kuhn C. Michalopoulos G. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of Smad7 enhanced EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis and nearly completely abolished activin A-induced growth inhibition of rat hepatocytes. Thus, our results indicate that the co-mitogenic effect of NE may be due, at least in part, to suppression of the autocrine activin A signaling via induction of Smad7. Autocrine activin has been reported to modulate hepatocyte proliferation in vitro andin vivo. Addition of the activin-binding protein, follistatin, to the culture enhances EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes (9Yasuda H. Mine T. Shibata H. Eto Y. Hasegawa Y. Takeuchi T. Asano S. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and administration of follistatin potentiates liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (10Kogure K. Omata W. Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Yasuda H. Mine T. Kojima I. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 1136-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, injection of follistatin into the portal vein initiates DNA synthesis even in the quiescent rat liver (46Kogure K. Zhang Y.Q. Maeshima A. Suzuki K. Kuwano H. Kojima I. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, NE can act as an inhibitor of autocrine activin signaling in rat hepatocytes. NF-κB is a dimeric, ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating inducible gene expression in immune and inflammatory responses (47Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). In most cells, NF-κB proteins exist in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex bound to the IκB family of inhibitory proteins. Various stimuli can induce rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, and degradation of IκB, resulting in nuclear translocation of NF-κB proteins and transcriptional activation. The critical role of NF-κB in the induction of Smad7 is supported by previous results. Using RelA-defective fibroblasts, Bitzer et al. (33Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Böttinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the induction of Smad7 by TNFα requires NF-κB. The anti-apoptotic effect of CD40 is associated with the transcriptional activation of Smad7 in an NF-κB-dependent manner in B cells (45Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J.

We demonstrated that NE stimulates NF-κB activation in rat hepatocytes and that inhibition of NF-κB pathway by a proteosome inhibitor or an IκB super-repressor abolished the Smad7 expression induced by NE.

There is a possibility that the Gq/protein kinase C pathway couples with the α1-adrenergic receptor to cause NF-κB activation. Using type 1 TNFα receptor-deficient mice, Yamada et al. (51Yamada Y.

In addition to co-mitogenic action, NE is possibly involved in initiation of liver regeneration through NF-κB activation. Together with these findings, our results indicate a novel link between Smad and the trimeric G protein signaling pathway in rat hepatocytes: NE rapidly increases the expression of an anti-Smad, Smad7, through NF-κB activation, causing the inhibition of activin-mediated growth inhibition. Our results also suggest the possible involvement of NE in modulating hepatocyte proliferation through NF-κB activation and Smad7 induction. We thank Dr. Y.

Phosphatidylinositol (PI)3-kinase signaling has been described to limit apoptosis in other systems. We hypothesized that PI3-kinase-dependent pathways regulate Fas-mediated apoptosis and barrier function in intestiynal epithelial cells (IEC). IEC lines (HT-29 and T84) were exposed to agonist anti-Fas antibody in the presence or absence of chemical inhibitors of PI3-kinase (LY294002 and wortmannin). Apoptosis, barrier function, changes in short circuit current (ΔI sc), and expression of adhesion molecules were assessed. Inhibition of PI3-kinase strongly sensitized IEC to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Expression of constitutively active Akt, a principal downstream effector of the PI3-kinase pathway, protected against Fas-mediated apoptosis to an extent that was comparable with expression of a genetic caspase inhibitor, p35. PI3-kinase inhibition sensitized to apoptosis by increasing and accelerating Fas-mediated caspase activation. Inhibition of PI3-kinase combined with cross-linking Fas was associated with increased permeability to molecules that were <400 Da but not those that were >3,000 Da. Inhibition of PI3-kinase resulted in chloride secretion that was augmented by cross-linking Fas. Confocal analyses revealed polymerization of actin and maintenance of epithelial cell adhesion molecule-mediated interactions in monolayers exposed to anti-Fas antibody in the context of PI3-kinase inhibition. PI3-kinase-dependent pathways, especially Akt, protect IEC against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of PI3-kinase in the context of Fas signaling results in increased chloride secretion and barrier dysfunction.

Because the epithelial lining of the intestine serves as a critical barrier preventing lumenal food antigens, bacterial products, and microorganisms from infiltrating the submucosa (3Pinkoski M.J. Brunner T. Green D.R. Lin T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G354-G366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), disruption in this barrier may initiate or perpetuate intestinal inflammation. One mechanism by which intestinal barrier function may be compromised in inflammatory bowel disease is pathologic intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis. Increased intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis is observed in ulcerative colitis (4Strater J. Wellisch I. Riedl S. Walczak H. Koretz K. Tandara A. Krammer P.H. Moller P.

We have developed an in vitro model of immune-mediated epithelial cell apoptosis that permits us to study the effect of Fas-mediated apoptosis on epithelial barrier function (6Abreu M.T.

As with colonic crypt epithelial cells, T84 cells express the Fas receptor and are sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis (4Strater J. Wellisch I. Riedl S. Walczak H. Koretz K. Tandara A. Krammer P.H. Moller P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 160-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These cells have also been used to model crypt abscesses (14Nash S. Parkos C. Nusrat A. Delp C. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1474-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Basolateral cross-linking of Fas on T84 monolayers induces apoptosis. Despite massive cell death, the barrier function to relatively small macromolecules remains intact. Our findings suggested that the intestinal epithelium is quite resilient in the face of apoptotic damage and is able to repair the wound created by apoptotic cell loss. Using this model, we wished to investigate the molecular mechanisms that protect against dysregulated apoptosis and perturbed barrier function in the intestine. The current study focuses on the inter-relationship between the Fas death receptor and phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 3-kinase signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells. We have chosen to study this interplay because Fas-mediated apoptosis of crypt intestinal epithelial cells is associated with human inflammatory bowel disease (4Strater J. Wellisch I. Riedl S.

Several lines of evidence support a role for PI3-kinase-dependent signaling in regulation of apoptosis in the intestine. In response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, PI3-kinase phosphorylates the 3 position of the inositol ring of membrane inositol phospholipids, resulting in the generation of 3-phosphorylated products including phosphotidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) (17Rameh L.E.

Taken together these data suggest that PI3-kinase-dependent pathways play a role in the regulation of apoptosis in the intestinal epithelium. PI3-kinase and Akt may also play important roles in epithelial adhesion and barrier function. Cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix or neighboring cells results in the activation of PI3-kinase, recruitment of Akt, and protection against apoptosis (32Watton S.J. Downward J. Curr.

Finally, PI3-kinase activation is involved in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to cell spreading (39van Weering D.H. de Rooij J. Marte B. Downward J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PI3-kinase-dependent mechanisms protect intestinal epithelial cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis and barrier dysfunction. We found that inhibition of PI3-kinase sensitizes intestinal epithelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis and exacerbates the barrier dysfunction associated with Fas-mediated apoptosis. Caspase inhibition protects against both apoptosis and increased monolayer permeability. Inhibition of PI3-kinase results in increased epithelial conductance and chloride secretion, which is increased further by activation of Fas. Despite marked apoptosis, the intestinal epithelial monolayer is able to maintain a relatively impermeable barrier by undergoing cytoskeletal changes and maintaining cell-cell adhesion. Our studies identify molecular mechanisms by which peptide growth factors may exert a beneficial clinical effect in patients with inflammatory diarrheal states.

The cells were kept in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Apoptosis was induced by the addition of agonist Ab to the Fas receptor (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Biomol Research Labs) or an irrelevant caspase inhibitor CBZ-Phe-Ala-FMK was added at a final concentration of 50 μm for 2 h before addition of anti-Fas (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA). The cells were preincubated with the PI3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 (Calbiochem) or wortmannin (Biomol Research Labs) for 2 h prior to addition of anti-Fas Ab unless otherwise stated. LY294002 was used at a concentration of 25 μm. Anti-Fas Ab was used at a concentration of 250 ng/ml added to the basolateral well of T84 culture inserts. Apoptosis was quantified by counting the number of nuclei demonstrating chromatin condensation per high power field or, in the case of M30 staining (below), by counting the number of M30-positive cells. Nuclear debris was not counted. An average of 10 fields/experiment were counted, and the observer was blinded to the treatment. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured using a Millipore Millicell-ERS Voltohmeter. The experiments were performed when monolayers achieved a TER that was >2000 ohms/cm2. Chloride secretion was measured as short circuit current (I sc) across monolayers of T84 cells, mounted in Ussing chambers (window area, 0.6 cm2) modified for use with cultured cells (41Dharmsathaphorn K. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dharmsathaphorn K. Madara J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 354-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).I sc (normalized to μA/cm2) was used to quantitate both basal transepithelial chloride secretion and that induced by inhibition of PI3-kinase and cross-linking Fas. T84 cells secrete chloride in response to various agonists, and the resulting changes in I sc are wholly reflective of chloride secretion (43Cartwright C.A. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). I sc measurements were carried out in Ringer's solution containing 140 mmNa+, 5.2 mm K+, 1.2 mmCa2+, 0.8 mm Mg2+, 119.8 mm Cl−, 25 mm HCO−3, 2.4 mm H2PO−4, 0.4 mmHPO4−2, and 10 mmglucose. For measurements of monolayer permeability, unconjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (formula weight 389.4) (Sigma) and dextran-FITC (molecular weight, 3,000) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were utilized as described previously (44Sanders S.E. Madara J.L. McGuirk D.K. Gelman D.S. Colgan S.P. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1995; 4: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg/ml of FITC or dextran-FITC was added to the apical well; the samples (50 μl) were removed from the basolateral well at indicated times and quantitated with a PerSeptive Biosystems CytoFluor® Multi-Well Plate Reader, Series 4000. The sensitivity of this assay is 5 ng/ml. Some monolayers were exposed to UV irradiation, which led to ∼80% cell death and served as a positive control for flux. UV irradiation of monolayers was accomplished by delivering 200 mJ/cm2 using a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). T84 cells were seeded in 12-mm transwells at 200,000 cells/well on the day before transfection. Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) reagent was used as per the manufacturer's instructions to transfect 1 μg of total DNA/well. To identify transfected cells, 0.3 μg of green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid (CLONTECH) was cotransfected with 0.7 μg of pCDNA3 (control plasmid) (Invitrogen), myristylated Akt, kinase-inactive Akt (45Dufner A.

For staining of caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18, M30 Cytodeath monoclonal Ab and anti-mouse-IgG-biotin were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicalsand used as per the manufacturer's instructions. Unless otherwise stated, all incubation steps were performed at room temperature. For actin staining, membranes were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, then permeabilized with cold acetone for 7 min at −20 °C, and incubated with 1 unit of phalloidin-FITC (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 30 min. To counterstain nuclei, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then incubated with 2.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) for 15 min. For EpCAM staining membranes were first washed with warmed Hanks' buffered saline solution with 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, incubated with 50 mmglycine in PBS for 20 min, blocked in PBS with 2% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin fraction V for 1 h, washed with PBS-GS (0.2% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 5 mmglycine in PBS), incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-EpCAM for 1 h, washed with PBS-GS, and incubated with 5 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 1 h. The nuclei were counterstained with 2.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 as described above. For zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) staining, the membranes were preextracted with a buffer containing 0.2% Triton-X, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 200 mm sucrose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.1) for 2 min on ice, followed by fixation in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with primary anti-ZO-1 Ab (1:200 dilution) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit Ab (1:100 dilution) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For desmoplakin staining, the membranes were fixed in methanol at −20 °C, blocked in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with primary anti-desmoplakin I + II Ab (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) (1:100 dilution) and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse Ab (1:50 dilution) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). For GFP-transfected cells, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The nuclei were counterstained with 50 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) for 30 min, followed by an incubation with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS for 15 min. Immunofluorescence was visualized with a Leica TCS SP laser scanning inverted confocal microscope. To analyze protein expression, Western blotting was performed for the presence of phosphorylated Akt, total Akt, and PTEN. Freshly isolated human colon epithelial cells were obtained from colonic resections after detachment in EDTA. Briefly, 1 × 106 intestinal epithelial cells (T84 or freshly isolated human colonic epithelial cells) were lysed in 150 μl of 2× SSB (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mmdithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), sonicated, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and 12 μl of boiled lysate (10 μg of protein) was separated in a 10% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and stained with Ponceau S to verify equal protein loading. For phosphorylated Western blots, the membranes were blocked in 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS for 2–3 h at 4 °C, incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase, developed by Lumiglo (Cell Signaling Technology), and exposed to radiographic film. For total Akt Western blots, the membranes were probed with an anti-Akt Ab as above (Cell Signaling Technology). For PTEN Western blots, the membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBS for 2 h, incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-PTEN in TBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h, washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS, incubated with 1:1000 anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon) in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed, and developed by Lumiglo followed by exposure to radiographic film. Student's t tests, standard deviation, and standard errors were performed using the statistics package within Microsoft Excel. Two-way analysis of variance was performed for the changes of I sc and G using Graph Pad Prizm (San Diego, CA). P values were considered statistically significant when <0.05. Intestinal epithelial cells depend on trophic signals for survival, and these survival signals may mediate their effect through activation of PI3-kinase. To constitute a relevant survival pathway in the gut, the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway must be present in human intestinal epithelial cells. We first wished to establish that the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway is functional in human intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal epithelial cell lines. We found that both freshly isolated colonic epithelial cells and intestinal epithelial cell lines express Akt protein (Fig. 1 A). We also wished to determine whether the intestinal epithelial cell lines used in our studies expressed the lipid phosphatase PTEN. PTEN mutations are associated with increased levels of phosphorylated Akt and may interfere with studying PI3-kinase in these cells. Fig. 1 B demonstrates that both cell lines express PTEN at a level comparable with freshly isolated colonic epithelial cells. Sequencing of the PTEN gene in T84 cells also did not reveal any mutations. 2J.-Y. Chow, K. E. Huang, S. Carethers, and J. Barrett, unpublished observations. Thus, intestinal epithelial cell lines are a valid model for studying both Fas-mediated apoptosis and PI3-kinase signaling in the gut. Based on recent data that PI3-kinase-dependent pathways protect against apoptosis in other systems, we hypothesized that PI3-kinase-dependent signals protect intestinal epithelial cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we used two models of Fas-mediated intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis: HT-29 and T84 cell monolayers (6Abreu M.T. Palladino A.A. Arnold E.T. Kwon R.S. McRoberts J.A.

Both T84 cells and HT-29 cells express Fas receptor, and cross-linking of the receptor with agonist Ab induces apoptosis. HT-29 cells, however, require preincubation with interferon γ to sensitize cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (48Abreu-Martin M.T. Vidrich A. Lynch D.H. Targan S.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4147-4154PubMed Google Scholar). To inhibit class I PI3-kinases we used the highly specific chemical inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. We determined the minimum concentration of LY294002 or wortmannin required to block insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, a target of PI3-kinase (Fig. 1 C). Using the minimum concentration of these inhibitors required to block PI3-kinase kinase, we found that inhibition of PI3-kinase strongly sensitized both HT-29 and T84 cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 2). Indeed, inhibition of PI3-kinase in HT-29 cells obviated the need for interferon γ sensitization for Fas-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of PI3-kinase alone did not result in significant apoptosis. Similar results were found with wortmannin (data not shown). These results suggest that PI3-kinase-dependent pathways constitutively protect intestinal epithelial cells from immune-mediated apoptosis. The data above suggest that PI3-kinase-dependent mechanisms protect intestinal epithelial cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis. We wished to test the hypothesis that Akt is the principal downstream effector mediating PI3-kinase-dependent protection from Fas-mediated apoptosis. To test this hypothesis we utilized a transient gene expression strategy to introduce a constitutively active allele of Akt. Akt is made constitutively active by the addition of a myristylation signal (myr-Akt) to the N terminus that targets the protein to the plasma membrane where it is phosphorylated (45Dufner A. Andjelkovic M. Burgering B.M. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4525-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). GFP was used as a marker of cell transfection. To quantify the effect of transgene expression on apoptosis, we counted the total numbers of GFP-positive cells/high power field and the percentage of cells with apoptotic morphology and chromatin condensation using propidium iod"

The former does not contain cysteine residues, whereas the latter contains a single conserved cysteine (Cys-21). We demonstrated that H2O2 at micromolar levels induces,in vitro, the formation of a disulfide dimer of muscle acylphosphatase, which displays properties differing from those of the reduced enzyme. In particular, we observed changes in the kinetic behavior of its intrinsic ATPase activity, whereas the kinetic behavior of its benzoyl phosphatase activity does not change. Moreover, the disulfide dimer is capable of interacting with some polynucleotides such as poly(G), poly(C), and poly(T) but not with poly(A), whereas the reduced enzyme does not bind polynucleotides. Experiments performed with H2O2 in the presence of increasing SDS concentrations demonstrated that disulfide dimer formation is prevented by SDS concentrations higher than 300 μm, suggesting that a non-covalently-linked dimer is present in non-denaturing solvents. Light-induced cross-linking experiments performed on the Cys-21 → Ser mutant in the pH range 3.8–9.0 have demonstrated that a non-covalently-linked dimer is in fact present in non-denaturing solutions and that an enzyme group with a p Ka of 6.4 influences the monomer-dimer equilibrium.

The MT isoform is prevalently expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, whereas the CT isoform is prevalently expressed in erythrocytes, in brain, and in testis (1Berti A. Degl'Innocenti D. Stefani M. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Ital. J. Biochem. 1987; 36: 82-91PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mizuno Y. Ohba Y. Fujita H. Kanesaka Y. Tamura T. Shiokawa H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Several reports on the possible physiological roles of the enzyme have been produced: Some indicate ACP as an enzyme involved in the control of membrane ion pumps (Refs. 3Nediani C. Marchetti E. Nassi P. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 959-968PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nassi P. Nediani C. Liguri G. Taddei N. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10867-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and citations therein), because it displays hydrolytic activity against the aspartyl-phosphate intermediates formed during the action of Na+,K+- and Ca2+-ATPases. Other reports involve ACP in cell differentiation and apoptosis (5Berti A. Degl'Innocenti D. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Chiarugi P. Raugei G. Marzocchini R. Fiaschi T. Ciccarelli C. Berti A. Ramponi G. Biochem.

Cell Death Diff. 1997; 4: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); this is because the enzyme is overexpressed when cells are induced to differentiate by certain agents, and it is able to migrate into the nucleus during both differentiation and apoptosis (8Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Chiarugi P. Solito E. Modesti A. Ramponi G. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chiarugi P. Degl'Innocenti D. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The primary structure of the two isoenzymes differs in about 50% of amino acid positions, but they display very similar folds: Both consist of a five-stranded antiparallel twisted β-sheet flanked on one side by two antiparallel α-helices running parallel to the β-sheet (10Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Taddei N. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Structure. 1997; 5: 69-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This peculiar ACP fold is very similar to that found in small RNA-binding domains of several RNA-binding proteins (11Ghetti A. Bolognesi M. Cobianchi F. Morandi C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H. Li J. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar); in fact, many RNA-binding proteins have modular structures consisting of RNA-binding modules and auxiliary domains that perform additional functions (13Nagai K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the involvement of ACP in polynucleotide processing. Chiarugi et al. (14Chiarugi P. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Taddei L. Camici G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 73-81PubMed Google Scholar) found that,in vitro, ACP catalyzes the hydrolysis of both DNA and RNA. This paper deals with the induction of MT ACP to form a disulfide dimer in the presence of micromolar concentrations of H2O2 and reports a study on the biochemical properties of the modified enzyme. Severe oxidative insults, such as the one occurring during phagocytosis in leukocytes (15Badwey J.A. Karnowsky M.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 695-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), drastically modify the cellular redox status by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), which then react with protein thiol groups thereby producing structural and functional modifications. Benzoyl phosphate was synthesized according to Camici et al. (16Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. Experientia. 1976; 32: 535Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ATP and 30-mer poly-deoxyribonucletides (poly(G), poly(A), poly(T), and poly(C)) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Recombinant MT-ACP was expressed and purified as previously described (17Modesti A. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Colombini B. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Cys-21 → Ser mutant of MT-ACP was obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a USE mutagenesis kit based on the unique site elimination (USE) method developed by Deng and Nickoloff (18Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing according to Sanger et al. (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) and by amino acid analysis of the purified proteins. All other reagents were the purest commercially available. The enzyme (0.4 μmol) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, was concentrated to 0.5 ml by ultrafiltration using Centricon YM10 and mixed with 4.5 ml of 9 m freshly deionized urea. Then, solid dithiothreitol (0.5 m final concentration) was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The reduced enzyme was purified from low Mr reagents by Superdex-75 chromatography (2.6 × 60 cm column); the gel was previously equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium formate buffer, pH 3.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. The elution was performed at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with the same buffer, and fractions of 3 ml were collected. The fractions containing the reduced enzyme were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration with YM10 Centricon, and conserved for weeks at −20 °C. The benzoyl phosphatase activity of ACP was assayed at 25 °C by a continuous optical test, using 5 mm benzoyl phosphate as substrate (20Ramponi G. Treves C. Guerritore A. Experientia. 1966; 22: 705-706Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (the final test volume was 1.5 ml). The ATPase activity of ACP was assayed at 37 °C by adding the enzyme to test mixtures containing 1 mm ATP (the final test volume was 0.81 ml). Aliquots were withdrawn at the appropriated times, and then the Pi released from ATP was determined by the method of Baginski et al. (21Baginski E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 15: 155-158Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The buffer used for both assays was 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.3. All assays were done at least in duplicate, taking into account the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the benzoyl phosphate and of the nucleotide. The main kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) were determined by measuring the initial rates at differing substrate concentrations (ranging from 0.1 to 5 mm for benzoyl phosphate, and 0.01 to 2.5 mmfor ATP). The experimental data were analyzed using the appropriate equations and linear or non-linear fitting programs (Fig.P, Biosoft, UK). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were dissolved in a non-reducing 2× Laemmli sample buffer or, alternatively, in a reducing 2× Laemmli sample buffer (containing 4% 2-mercaptoethanol). The reactions were carried out at 25 °C in a 1-cm light path spectrophotometer cuvette. Enzyme (9 μm) was dissolved in 0.8 ml of 0.1m buffer at the appropriate pH value, and the reaction was started by adding a 5-fold molar excess of DTNB. Measurements were taken with a Beckman model 7500 diode-array spectrophotometer; the absorbance values were acquired at the rate of 10 points per second. Reaction progress was fitted to a single exponential to calculate the first order kinetic constant. The second order kinetic constants at the tested pH values were then calculated by dividing the observed first order rate constants by the DTNB concentration. ACP (118 μm) in 0.1 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.0, was mixed with H2O2 (160 μm, final volume 0.3 ml). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C; aliquots were withdrawn at various time intervals to assay benzoyl phosphatase and ATPase activities. Other aliquots, taken during the incubation time, were mixed with a nonreducing 2× Laemmli sample buffer and then incubated for 3 min at 100 °C for SDS-PAGE analysis. Fig. 1 A shows that H2O2 induces a time-dependent disappearance of the reduced form of ACP (11 kDa) as well as the appearance of a new protein band (22 kDa), a dimeric form of the enzyme, which prevails after 30 min. The weak band of dimer visible in lane 1 is caused by the handling of the reduced enzyme in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. This band is absent in the freshly purified enzyme (data not shown). The time courses of H2O2-induced dimer formation and monomer loss are reported in Fig. 1 B (the relative concentrations of monomer and dimer were measured by densitometry). Furthermore, another aliquot of the mixture containing ACP, previously incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with 160 μm H2O2, was mixed with a reducing 2× Laemmli sample buffer (i.e.containing 4% 2-mercaptoethanol) and then incubated at 100 °C for 3 min prior to performing the SDS-PAGE analysis. The last laneof Fig. 1 A shows that reducing conditions cause the disappearance of the 22-kDa band, suggesting that it consists of a disulfide dimer of ACP. We also performed a time course experiment incubating the Cys-21 → Ser mutant of ACP with 160 μmH2O2 at the above experimental conditions. SDS-PAGE analysis, performed after 30-min incubation at 25 °C, shows the presence of the 11-kDa band only (data not shown), thus demonstrating the essential role of Cys-21 in the H2O2-induced dimer formation. To clarify whether disulfide bridge formation is caused by collision during diffusion of two separate ACP molecules or by H2O2-induced cross-linking of two subunits of a pre-existing non-covalently stabilized dimer, we investigated the formation of the ACP disulfide dimer in the presence of both H2O2 and SDS, a denaturing agent. Fig. 2 Ashows that SDS prevents ACP cross-linking by H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner. In particular, we observed a sharp transition in the cross-linking capability of ACP by H2O2, with a midpoint at 200 μm SDS. At SDS concentrations higher than 300 μm, no dimer formation was observed upon H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2 A). To clarify the mechanism that produces this effect, we measured fluorescence spectra of ACP in solutions at increasing SDS concentrations. Fig. 2 B shows the changes in tryptophan fluorescence intensity (excitation, 280 nm; emission, 334 nm) at varying SDS concentrations. It can be seen that ACP shows a sharp two-state transition profile. Using a non-linear least-squares analysis, experimental data points were fitted to a modified version of the Boltzman sigmoidal equation (23Steer B.A. Dinardo A.A. Merrill A.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar),X[SDS]=(XN+mN[SDS])−(XD+mD[SDS])1+exp[([SDS]−SDS1/2/dx]+(XD+mD[SDS])Eq. 1 where X[SDS] is the fluorescence intensity value at a particular concentration of SDS, and the remaining six terms are fitting parameters. The term XNand XD are the values of the measured fluorescence extrapolated to zero concentration of SDS, and mN and mD are the slopes for the dependence of XN and XD on SDS concentration. The transition midpoint, an SDS concentration, is termed SDS12; dxis the width of the fitting subinterval. The calculated midpoint is 545 ± 12 μm SDS concentration. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the capacity of ACP to form a disulfide dimer upon H2O2 treatment is lost at SDS concentrations higher than 300 μm, a concentration substantially lower than the one necessary to cause a structural transition of the enzyme (midpoint = 545 μm SDS). This suggests the presence of a non-covalent dimeric form of ACP in non-denaturing solutions. To further assess the existence of a non-covalent dimer form in solutions containing reduced ACP, we performed chemical cross-linking experiments triggered by light in the presence of tris-bipyridylruthenium(II), using the Cys-21 → Ser mutant of the enzyme. The method is based on a process that involves brief photolysis of tris-bipyridylruthenium(II) dication with visible light in the presence of the electron-acceptor ammonium persulfate and the protein of interest (24Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The Cys-21 → Ser mutant of the enzyme (18 μm, final volume 110 μl) in the appropriate buffer solutions (3.8–9.0 pH range; the buffers used were: 0.1 msodium 3,3-dimethylglutarate, pH 3.8–7.6; 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8–8.5; 0.1 m glycine-NaOH, pH 9.0) was mixed with 60 μm dipyridylruthenium(II) and 90 μmammonium persulfate (final concentrations). The solutions were placed in 1.7-ml Eppendorf tubes positioned parallel to the beam of light at a distance of 20 cm from a 150-watt incandescent lamp (Osram). The samples were irradiated for 15 s, and immediately after irradiation they were quenched with 110 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, heated to 100 °C for 5 min; SDS-PAGE analysis was then performed. Fig. 3 A shows the results obtained in experiments performed in the pH range 3.8–9.0. It can be seen that dipyridylruthenium(II) photolysis resulted in the production of a covalently linked dimer of the Cys-21 → Ser ACP mutant at all tested pH. We measured the relative concentration (%) of monomer and dimer at the tested pH by densitometry, and data were fitted to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,kobs=kmin+kmax−kmin1+10pKa­pHEq. 2 where kmax is the highest and kmin the lowest measured kobs value, respectively. A p Ka value of 6.4 ± 0.1 (see Fig. 3 B) for the cross-linking reaction was calculated. This finding indicates the presence of an enzyme group with p Ka 6.4 that influences the equilibrium between a non-covalently-linked dimer and the monomer in non-denaturing solvents. Experiments similar to those reported in Fig. 3 A were performed with lysozyme at the same protein concentration and conditions, but they do not produce any dimeric form of lysozyme. Taken together, all findings clearly demonstrate that a non-covalent dimeric form of ACP exists in solutions of reduced enzyme prior to H2O2 treatment. Reduced ACP (9 μm) dissolved in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, was titrated with excess DTNB to measure solvent-exposed thiol groups in the enzyme. We found that only 0.38 thiol residue per molecule of enzyme reacted with DTNB to produce the yellow DTNB thiolate anion. On the contrary, 0.83 thiol residue per molecule of enzyme reacted with DTNB when titration was performed in the presence of 35 mm SDS. The observed molar ratio of 0.83 in 35 mm SDS reflects the difficulty in obtaining the enzyme in full thiol form, because atmospheric oxygen also induces appreciable thiol cross-linking during laboratory handling of the enzyme (see Fig. 1 A, first lane). Taking into account the results reported in Fig. 2, we realize that 35 mm SDS certainly produces structural modifications and thus the dissociation of the non-covalent dimeric form of the reduced enzyme. Because the ACP molecule contains a single thiol group (Cys-21), these findings also suggest that at least two molecular forms of the reduced enzyme exist in non-denaturing solvents: The former has a thiol group exposed to the solvent, whereas the latter (probably a non-covalent dimer) contains at least one thiol group non-exposed to the solvent. We determined the p Ka of the exposed thiol group by measuring the rate of thiol disulfide exchange reaction between ACP and DTNB in non-denaturing solvent conditions at varying pH in the range 5.5–10.8. The measured second order rate constants were plotted against pH (Fig. 4), and data were fitted to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (Equation 2), enabling us to calculate a p Ka of 8.3 ± 0.1 for the solvent-exposed thiol group of ACP. That p Ka is in fact related to the exposed thiol group dissociation, because dimer-monomer equilibrium is scarcely affected by pH above 7.0, as demonstrated by Fig. 3 B, which shows the effect of pH on the relative dimer and monomer concentrations of the Cys-21 → Ser mutant of ACP. Previously, we demonstrated that ACP displays nucleoside di- and tri-phosphatase activities in addition to its canonical activity (25Paoli P. Camici G. Manao G. Giannoni E. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed experiments to study the effect of H2O2 on two known catalytic activities of ACP, using benzoyl phosphate and ATP as substrates. The reduced enzyme (118 μm) in 0.1 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.0, was treated with H2O2 (160 μm, final volume 0.3 ml), and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at various time intervals to assay both the benzoyl phosphatase and the ATPase activities of the enzyme. Fig. 5 A shows the time courses of both activities during the exposure of the enzyme to H2O2. We can observe that the benzoyl phosphatase activity remains unchanged, whereas the ATPase activity of ACP decreases in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed that the treatment of the reduced ACP with relatively high concentrations of H2O2 (up to 20 mm) does not result in a complete loss of ATPase activity, indicating that the S–S dimeric form maintains a fraction of the original ATPase activity (residual activity about 28%, data not shown). The different behaviors of the benzoyl phosphatase and the ATPase activities of ACP were unexpected, because previous studies demonstrated that this enzyme uses a unique active site to carry on both activities (25Paoli P. Camici G. Manao G. Giannoni E. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The linear correlation between the formation of disulfide dimeric form of ACP and the loss of its ATPase activity is shown in Fig. 5 B, demonstrating that H2O2 can regulate the ATPase activity of the enzyme. The partial loss of ATPase activity is reversible, as demonstrated by the following experiment: The mixture containing 118 μm ACP and 160 μmH2O2 in 0.1 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.0 (final volume 0.3 ml), was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min; then 4.4 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration) was added, and the time course of the recovery of ATPase activity was monitored for an additional 60 min. Fig. 5 A shows that treatment of ATPase- inactivated enzyme with dithiothreitol causes a time-dependent recovery of this activity. All findings demonstrate that H2O2 not only induces the formation of a disulfide cross-linking between two ACP molecules, but also modifies at least one known functional property of the enzyme,i.e. its ATPase activity. We observed that the treatment of ACP with relatively high concentrations of H2O2 (up to 20 mm) does not apparently produce the complete loss of ATPase activity, indicating that the disulfide dimeric form maintains a fraction of the original ATPase activity (Fig. 6). We purified the S–S dimer by Superdex-75 chromatography; the SDS-PAGE analysis of this preparation shows a single band at 22 kDa (not shown). Then we studied some of its properties. Fig. 7 A shows the plot of the residual ATPase activity of the reduced ACP versus the ATP concentration; the inset reports a similar plot for the disulfide dimer. It can be seen that, although the data for the reduced enzyme fit the Michaelis-Menten equation well and then display a hyperbolic curve, the data relative to the disulfide dimer do not agree with the equation of Michaelis, showing no evident saturation in the range 0–3000 μmATP. Replotting the experimental points according to the Eadie-Scatchard equation,vo[S]=−1Km×vo+VmaxKmEq. 3 where vo is the relative activity, we can see that the curve relative to the disulfide dimer is clearly biphasic, whereas the reduced enzyme gives the expected straight line(Fig. 7 B). Such kinetic behavior has been described for a mixture of two enzymes catalyzing the same reaction or for a multisite enzyme that has substrate-binding sites of different affinities or in the case of enzymes that display negative cooperativity (26Segel I.H. Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 64-71Google Scholar). Taking into account that these experiments were carried out with a pure protein, the presence in the disulfide dimer of two binding sites with different affinities cannot be excluded: The linear fitting of the data displayed by the disulfide dimer in the low ATP concentration range (10–80 μm) enabled us to calculate a Km1 of 23 μm and a kcat1 of 0.047 s−1, whereas the fitting of the experimental points in the 0.16–3.00 mm ATP concentration range gives a Km2 of 1210 μm and a kcat2 of 0.204 s−1(Km1 and kcat1 are kinetic parameters relative to active site 1, whereas Km2 and kcat2 are kinetic parameters relative to active site 2 of the dimer) (Table I).Figure 7The kinetics of the ATPase activity of the disulfide dimer of ACP differs from that of the reduced enzyme. A, plot of ATPase activity of the reduced enzyme against the ATP concentration. The inset reports a similar plot for the disulfide dimer. B, Eadie-Scatchard analysis of the data displayed in A. The clear biphasic behavior indicates that the disulfide dimer contains two active sites differing for binding affinity.

Open table in a new tab Taken together, the above kinetic data suggest that the observed apparent loss of ATPase activity of the disulfide dimer of ACP with respect to that of the reduced enzyme is mainly caused by the modification of its catalytic center due to the formation of two active sites with different affinity for ATP. Site 1 is completely saturated by the 1.0 mm ATP concentration used in the standard ATPase assay, because its Km value is 23 μm, whereas site 2 is far from saturation, because its Km is 1210 μm. ACP (10 μm), dissolved in the appropriate 0.1 mbuffer (pH 6.5, sodium cacodylate; pH range 7.1–8.55, Tris-HCl; pH range 9–10.8, glycine-NaOH, all containing 2 mm EDTA), was incubated at 25 °C in the presence of 130 μmH2O2. At appropriate times, aliquots were withdrawn to measure the residual ATPase activity of the enzyme. Residual activity was plotted against reaction time, and progress data were fitted to a single exponential to calculate the first order rate constants for the apparent loss of ATPase activity (Fig. 8 A). The observed first order rate constants divided by the concentration of H2O2 yielded the second order rate constants. The p Ka for the ATPase inactivation (8.9 ± 0.1) was estimated by fitting the data of the second order rate constants versus pH to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (Equation 1) (Fig. 8 B). This p Ka value is 0.6 unit higher than that measured by DTNB titration of the exposed free thiol group of ACP, suggesting that the apparent loss of ATPase activity is not directly caused by the initial chemical modification of the Cys-21 thiol by H2O2, as shown in Scheme 1, Reaction 1, where H2O2 first reacts with thiols forming sulfenic acids (or other reactive compounds), which successively can react with vicinal thiols forming intra- or intermolecular disulfide bridges (27Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). and are the two monomers of ACP; the symbol “∥” indicates non-covalent interactions. This hypothesis agrees with the non-essentiality of Cys-21 for the catalytic hydrolysis of ATP. In fact, the kinetic parameters for the ATPase activity of the ACP Cys-21 → Ser mutant are the following: Km = 0.23 ± 0.01 mm, and kcat = 0.31 ± 0.01 s−1, indicating that the mutant is fully active. Therefore, we suggest that the p Ka values of 8.9 for the H2O2-induced apparent loss of the ATPase activity of ACP is to be related to the dissociation of the thiol group involved in Reaction 2 of Scheme 1. Taking into account that ACP possesses a fold very similar to that contained in some polynucleotide-binding proteins (11Ghetti A. Bolognesi M. Cobianchi F. Morandi C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H. Li J. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of different 30-mer polynucleotides (poly(A), poly(G), poly(T), poly(C)) to inhibit the benzoyl phosphatase activity of both untreated ACP- and H2O2-produced disulfide dimer. We measured the initial rates of benzoyl phosphate hydrolysis (concentration range 0.2–5 mm) in the presence of different polynucleotide concentrations. The data were fitted to the reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk equation,1vo=KmVmax×1vo+1VmaxEq. 4 using a linear regression program. Fig. 9 shows that the disulfide dimer of ACP is inhibited by low micromolar concentrations in three out of four tested polynucleotides (poly(G), poly(T), and poly(C)), although it is not inhibited by poly(A). The reduced enzyme is not inhibited by the above polynucleotides. The graphs relative to the inhibition of the disulfide dimer by poly(G), poly(T), and poly(C) show Vmax values very close to that measured in the absence of polynucleotides, indicating that the inhibition is competitive. The Km values calculated from the graphs were re-plotted against the polynucleotide concentration, obtaining a straight line that intersects the abscissa at a point corresponding to −Ki (Fig. 10). Furthermore the data summarized in Table I together with other kinetic parameters of both reduced and disulfide dimer ACP forms, show Ki values in the 10−6 to 10−7 molar range, demonstrating that poly(G), poly(T), and poly(C) possess high affinities for the disulfide dimer of ACP. These findings demonstrate that H2O2, by inducing the formation of disulfide dimer of ACP, modifies certain biological properties of the enzyme, such as its capacity to bind some kinds of polynucleotides, and its intrinsic ATPase activity.Figure 10Replots of Km(obs) against the concentration of polynucleotides. The Km(obs) values were calculated from the experiments reported in Fig. 9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, our results indicate that muscle ACP is extremely sensitive to oxidation; in fact, the exposition of the enzyme to atmospheric molecular oxygen during enzyme purification hinders the possibility of obtaining a completely purified thiol form (see above). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that H2O2 at micromolar concentrations induce the formation of a cross-linked disulfide dimer of the enzyme and modify some properties, suggesting that ACP also mediates some biological effects of ROS in vivo. Changes of cell environment are always accompanied by an adaptation response that generally involves modifications of protein structure-function properties. Well-established mechanisms for such regulation are protein-protein interactions, allosteric changes induced by ligand binding, proteolytic processing, and chemical modifications such as acylation, alkylation, and phosphorylation. However, the molecular mechanisms of the response of cells to oxidative stress conditions, which generate ROS, are still poorly understood. ROS produced during oxidative stress may react with protein side chains such as thiol groups, with consequent modification of protein structure and/or function. MT-ACP, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, contained three ACP molecular forms that were separated by cation exchange chromatography (28Manao G. Camici G. Stefani M. Berti A. Cappugi G. Liguri G. Nassi P. Ramponi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar): the first (68%) was the mixed disulfide with glutathione, the second (3%) remained uncharacterized, and the third (29% of total enzymatic protein) was an S–S dimeric form of the enzyme. On the other hand, we demonstrated that the main natural form of the enzyme contained in the freshly excised muscle is the reduced one (29Berti A. Stefani M. Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 28: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above findings indicate the strong tendency of MT-ACP first to be oxidized by the atmospheric molecular oxygen and then induced to form a mixed disulfide with cellular glutathione or a disulfide dimer during enzyme extraction and purification. Here we report new results on the in vitro induction of MT ACP to form a disulfide dimer in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, which is also produced in vivo during oxidative stress conditions. The S–S cross-linking of the ACP is accompanied by modification of some biological properties; particularly, we observed an apparent decrease in its intrinsic ATPase activity (due to changes in the kinetic behavior), and a strong enhancement in its ability to bind with certain monotone polynucleotides (poly(G), poly(T), and poly(C)). Neither the reduced nor the disulfide dimer form of ACP is able to bind poly(A). Previous studies have reported that the MT-ACP isoenzyme migrates into the nucleus upon induction of differentiation (8Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Chiarugi P. Solito E. Modesti A. Ramponi G. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar) or apoptosis (9Chiarugi P. Degl'Innocenti D. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the CT-ACP isoenzyme, which does not contain cysteine, remains in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the two isoenzymes perform different cell functions. Nevertheless, the mechanism that induces nuclear migration of this particular isoenzyme and the physiological significance of this event remained unknown. In a recent review (30Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar) Schafer and Buettner report data that suggest a correlation between the half-cell reduction potential (Ehc) of the GSSG/2GSH redox couple with the biological status of the cell. In particular, they indicate that an Ehc of about −240 mV correlates with the proliferating status, an Ehc of about −200 mV with the differentiation status, and an Ehc of about −170 mV with the apoptotic status and hypothesize that reduction potential-driven nano-switches move cells through different biological stages. The exact nature of these nano-switches remains to be determined, but clearly protein thiols are the principal candidates to sustain this function. The formation of ROS in particular cell conditions is generally the cause of cellular Ehc modification of the GSSG/2GSH redox couple. The present findings indicate that the MT isoenzyme of ACP is one of the targets of the cellular action of ROS. We suggest that the observed migration into the nucleus of this particular isoenzyme (8Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Chiarugi P. Solito E. Modesti A. Ramponi G. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chiarugi P. Degl'Innocenti D. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which contains a single conserved cysteine, is triggered during differentiation and apoptosis by the formation of a disulfide cross-linked dimer caused by the more positive redox potential associated with both physiological processes (30Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar). This modification of the enzyme is accompanied by changes in the capacity to bind polynucleotides and in its intrinsic ATPase activity. Our research does not clarify whether these changes have an active role in the initiation or progression of differentiation or apoptosis, but it certainly gives us new ideas for further studies of the still unknown physiological function of ACP, an enzyme widely expressed in metazoan tissues as two molecular forms."

The β-globin locus also includes the locus control region (LCR),1 which encompasses five DNase I super-hypersensitive sites (HS1-HS5) located between ∼6 and 21 kb 5′ of the ε-globin gene (1Forrester W.C.

A naturally occurring deletion of this region results in γδβ-thalassemia even in the presence of the intact genes (6Driscoll M.C. Dobkin C.S. Alter B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and LCR sequences must be included in transgenic mouse constructs to activate human globin gene transcription to a level similar to that of the endogenous mouse globin genes (4Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Recent experiments suggest that, at least in the mouse, the LCR is required for high levels of β-like globin expression, but other elements are sufficient to establish the open chromatin structure of the locus (7Bender M.A. Bulger M.

Evidence also supports a tracking model in which intergenic transcripts within the β-globin locus play a role in remodeling specific chromatin domains to facilitate regulation of the temporal expression of the β-like globin genes (9Gribnau J. Diderich K. Pruzina S. Calzolari R. Fraser P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).It is well established that suppression of β-globin gene expression in early development depends on the presence of the γ-globin gene (10Enver T.

Transgenic mice with a construct including LCR sequences, the intact β-globin gene, and a partially deleted γ-globin gene without its promoter, first exon, and first intron inappropriately express the human β-globin gene in the embryo (14Anderson K.P. Lloyd J.A. Ponce E. Crable S.C. Neumann J.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In studies with a construct containing the β-globin gene and a γ-globin gene with the β-spectrin promoter, the β-globin gene is also expressed in the embryo (15Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these experiments support a specific role for the γ-globin promoter in β-globin gene suppression. Competition with the γ-globin gene for the enhancing activity of the LCR, therefore, appears to be at least one mechanism by which β-globin expression is inhibited in early development. Further support for this competition model comes from experiments in which in situ hybridization of nascent globin transcripts demonstrate that only one β-like globin gene is generally transcribed at a time at each β-globin locus, suggesting that the genes are competing for a shared enhancer (16Wijgerde M. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Nature. 1995; 377: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar,17Milot E. Strouboulis J. Trimborn T. Wijgerde M. de Boer E. Langeveld A. Tan-Un K. Vergeer W. Yannoutsos N. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Cell. 1996; 87: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which this gene competition might occur is not known. Protein-protein interactions between factors binding to the LCR and to the γ-globin promoter may occur by DNA looping and result in the competitive inhibition of the β-globin gene (18Engel J.D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Townes T.M. Behringer R.R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 219-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Later in development, interactions between the β-globin promoter and the LCR would be favored. Evidence for DNA looping comes from studies of the long range activity of the chick β/ε enhancer on the β-globin gene.

It is clear that the mechanism(s) for the coordinate regulation of the β-globin genes must involve stage-specific factors.In previous work, we have found that a γ-globin gene with 161 bp of promoter sequence 5′ of the transcription start site is sufficient to suppress early β-globin gene expression in tissue culture assays. Using transgenic mice, we have also shown that the −136 to +56 region of the γ-globin promoter is necessary for embryonic inhibition of β-globin gene expression. (13Sargent T.G. Buller A.M.

DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) The γ-globin promoter beginning around position −145 contains a CACCC element, two CCAAT boxes, the stage-selector element, and a TATA box, all of which have been investigated for their roles in developmental regulation (Fig.1 A). Simultaneous mutations of the CCAAT boxes in transgenic mice revealed that these elements play a negligible role in γ-globin expression and β-globin suppression (24Ronchi A. Berry M. Raguz S. Imam A.

Using stable transfection assays of constructs containing HS3, HS2, and the γ- and β-globin genes in human erythroleukemia (HEL) and K562 cells, we have shown that the γ-globin CACCC and TATA elements, but not the stage-selector element, are important in suppressing β-globin expression in erythroid cells with an early developmental program (25Sargent T.G.

We show that the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements play key, distinct roles in precluding early β-globin expression and coordinately regulate the expression of the γ- and β-globin genes at different stages in transgenic mice. The TATA element plays a constitutive role in γ-globin gene expression, and the CACCC element is essential for expression of the γ-globin gene in the fetus. Both elements are required for optimal γ-globin expression and β-globin silencing in early development. Therefore, the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements are likely to establish early β-globin silencing by binding factors that favor the expression of the γ-globin gene and preclude the expression of the β-globin gene.DISCUSSIONAccording to the competition model, transcription of the γ-globin gene early in development precludes the expression of the β-globin gene because the γ-globin promoter directly or indirectly engages the LCR, limiting interactions between the LCR and the β-globin gene (18Engel J.D.

We had previously shown that elements downstream of −161, including the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements, are important for suppression of the β-globin gene in embryonic/fetal erythroid cells. In this work, we confirm these results in an in vivo developmental system, demonstrate that the γ-globin TATA and CACCC are the major regulators of embryonic β-globin silencing, show that these elements function coordinately, and establish that the CACCC element has stage-specific effects in γ- to β-globin switching. The results indicate that the γ-globin TATA element is required both for normal levels of embryonic transcription and for initiation of transcription at the appropriate site.Data from transgenic mice and transfected cells indicate that both the TATA and CACCC elements are required in order for the γ-globin gene to most effectively inhibit β-globin gene expression in early development. Experiments in transfected HEL cells show that the TATA and CACCC elements are the major γ-globin promoter elements responsible for β-globin suppression in early development. In previous work, we studied an HS2γΔtsβ construct in transgenic mice (13Sargent T.G. Buller A.M. Teachey D.T. McCanna K.S. Lloyd J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In three lines of HS2γΔtsβ mice, the percentage of β-globin expression compared with mouse β-like globin at 10.5 dpc were 6, 21, and 21%. In 5 lines of HS2γβ mice, there was between 0.0 and 1.4% β-globin expression at 10.5 dpc. The average % β-globin expression at 10.5 dpc is 10.3 for the lines with HS3HS2γT/Cβ and 0.8 for the HS3HS2γβ mice. This emphasizes that the fold effect of the T/C mutation is similar to that of the Δts mutation.In comparing the expression of constructs with mutations in the two elements to those with the single mutations, there is at least an additive effect on increasing the β/γ globin mRNA ratio in HEL cells, and this effect is even more evident in an in vivodevelopmental system in embryonic and fetal transgenic mice. This suggests that the proteins binding to the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements can work independently but coordinate to establish a greater effect on the regulation of globin gene developmental switching.The data indicate that the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements each have different roles. Transgenic mouse experiments show that the γ-globin TATA element plays a role in γ-globin expression and β-globin suppression in the embryo and fetus; in contrast, the CACCC element has a stage-specific effect in the fetus. Ryan et al. (30Ryan T.M. Sun C.W. Ren J. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2736-2740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) studied the effects of a mutation in the γ-globin CACCC element on the human β/γ-globin mRNA ratio in the yolk sac of transgenic mice. Their results differed from the data presented here in that they observed an increased β/γ globin mRNA ratio in the yolk sac, whereas in our experiments the ratio was not increased at 10.5 days but was increased at 14.5 days. However, qualitative inspection of their data shows that the β/γ ratio is much higher at 14.5 than at 10.5 dpc and that their CACCC mutation appears to affect γ-globin transcription at 14.5 and not 10.5 dpc, which is consistent with the stage-specific effects described here. Most importantly, in the current work, the CACCC and TATA mutations are compared, demonstrating that both are important for β-globin gene silencing but that the CACCC element is unique in that it has a stage-specific effect. Ryan et al. (30Ryan T.M. Sun C.W. Ren J. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2736-2740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that the γ-globin GATA-1 and Oct-1 binding elements are not involved in β-globin suppression, which is consistent with our previous data indicating that the elements necessary for this effect are downstream of −161 (13Sargent T.G. Buller A.M. Teachey D.T. McCanna K.S. Lloyd J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).The fact that the γ-globin CACCC element has a stage-specific effect is consistent with the role of the β-globin CACCC element. Targeted gene knock-outs in mice indicate that the erythroid Krüppel-like factor exerts its effects through the proximal CACCC element in the β-globin promoter, and it is responsible for positively regulating this gene in the adult (31Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A lack of the erythroid Krüppel-like factor does not reduce γ-globin gene expression (31Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that a different protein binding to the γ-globin CACCC element has a significant role in stage-specific expression. In the future, it will be of interest to identify the transcription factor(s) that binds to the γ-globin CACCC element to elicit its stage-specific effects. Two fetal erythroid kruppel-like factors (FKLF-1 and FKLF-2) have been identified and are candidates that may have this function (34Asano H. Li X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3571-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Asano H. Li X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 3578-3584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FKLF-1 and FKLF-2 increase transcription of a γ-globin promoter-reporter gene fusion construct in transient transfection assays, and they require the CACCC element for this activity. DNA binding assays have not been performed to demonstrate that either FKLF-1 or FKLF-2 binds to the γ-globin CACCC element. The factors do not appear to be specific for the γ-globin gene because they increase ε- and β-globin gene transcription as well. Further work will need to be done to determine whether one of these factors or some other factor(s) is responsible for the stage-specific activity of the γ-globin CACCC element.In adult mice with the HS3HS2γβ construct, the γ-globin gene is not silenced to the same extent as it is in the native locus in humans. This has previously been observed with other constructs (10Enver T. Raich N. Ebens A.J. Papayannopoulou T. Costantini F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 12Lloyd J.A. Krakowsky J.M. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Behringer R.R. Ryan T.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). There are several possible explanations for this finding. It is possible that an element necessary for adult silencing is absent from the HS3HS2γβ construct. The shorter than normal distance between the LCR elements and the γ-globin gene in this construct may reduce silencing. It is also possible that HS3 and HS2, in the absence of HS1 and/or HS4, are not sufficient to correctly down-regulate the γ-globin gene in the adult.The competition model for the developmental regulation of the human γ- and β-globin genes is consistent with a mechanism of interactions between the genes and the LCR via a looping model, a linking model, or both. The finding that the γ-globin CACCC and TATA elements are both necessary for competition does not distinguish whether looping and/or linking occurs, but it does add some structure to the model for globin gene switching. If looping is a major mechanism in establishing the enhancer activity of the LCR, then factors binding to the γ-globin CACCC and TATA elements are required to establish protein-protein interactions with factors binding to the LCR, thereby forming an LCR-γ-globin gene loop. If linking is the major mechanism, then when the γ-globin CACCC and TATA elements are occupied, this inhibits the ability of protein complexes to establish a complete connection along the chromatin between the LCR and the β-globin gene. For example, binding of factors to the γ-globin CACCC and TATA elements could change the chromatin conformation so that the linking complexes could not bind to the DNA between the γ- and the β-globin genes. Alternatively, since the binding of CACCC and TATA factors facilitates transcription of the γ-globin gene, transcription may in turn diminish looping or linking between the LCR and the β-globin gene. Whether looping, linking, or some other mechanism is involved, β-like globin gene regulation must depend on the presence of stage-specific factors, such as CACCC-binding proteins, to establish whether LCR-γ-globin or LCR-β-globin gene interactions are favored. These data demonstrate that the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements are essential for coordinate regulation of the γ- and β-globin genes in development. The major human β-like globin genes are the embryonic ε-globin, the two fetal γ-globin, and the adult β-globin genes (see Fig. 1 A). The β-globin locus also includes the locus control region (LCR),1 which encompasses five DNase I super-hypersensitive sites (HS1-HS5) located between ∼6 and 21 kb 5′ of the ε-globin gene (1Forrester W.C.

A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The LCR has strong enhancer activity (3Tuan D.Y. Solomon W.B. London I.M. Lee D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 4Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar) and can initiate and maintain erythroid-specific open chromatin structure to allow for the activation of gene expression (1Forrester W.C.

Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A naturally occurring deletion of this region results in γδβ-thalassemia even in the presence of the intact genes (6Driscoll M.C. Dobkin C.S. Alter B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and LCR sequences must be included in transgenic mouse constructs to activate human globin gene transcription to a level similar to that of the endogenous mouse globin genes (4Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Recent experiments suggest that, at least in the mouse, the LCR is required for high levels of β-like globin expression, but other elements are sufficient to establish the open chromatin structure of the locus (7Bender M.A. Bulger M. Close J. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8Epner E. Reik A. Cimbora D. Telling A. Bender M.A. Fiering S. Enver T. Martin D.I. Kennedy M. Keller G. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Evidence also supports a tracking model in which intergenic transcripts within the β-globin locus play a role in remodeling specific chromatin domains to facilitate regulation of the temporal expression of the β-like globin genes (9Gribnau J. Diderich K. Pruzina S. Calzolari R. Fraser P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It is well established that suppression of β-globin gene expression in early development depends on the presence of the γ-globin gene (10Enver T. Raich N. Ebens A.J. Papayannopoulou T. Costantini F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 11Hanscombe O. Whyatt D. Fraser P. Yannoutsos N. Greaves D. Dillon N. Grosveld F.

Transgenic mice with a construct including LCR sequences, the intact β-globin gene, and a partially deleted γ-globin gene without its promoter, first exon, and first intron inappropriately express the human β-globin gene in the embryo (14Anderson K.P. Lloyd J.A. Ponce E. Crable S.C. Neumann J.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In studies with a construct containing the β-globin gene and a γ-globin gene with the β-spectrin promoter, the β-globin gene is also expressed in the embryo (15Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these experiments support a specific role for the γ-globin promoter in β-globin gene suppression. Competition with the γ-globin gene for the enhancing activity of the LCR, therefore, appears to be at least one mechanism by which β-globin expression is inhibited in early development. Further support for this competition model comes from experiments in which in situ hybridization of nascent globin transcripts demonstrate that only one β-like globin gene is generally transcribed at a time at each β-globin locus, suggesting that the genes are competing for a shared enhancer (16Wijgerde M. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Nature. 1995; 377: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar,17Milot E. Strouboulis J. Trimborn T. Wijgerde M. de Boer E. Langeveld A. Tan-Un K. Vergeer W. Yannoutsos N. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Cell. 1996; 87: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this gene competition might occur is not known. Protein-protein interactions between factors binding to the LCR and to the γ-globin promoter may occur by DNA looping and result in the competitive inhibition of the β-globin gene (18Engel J.D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Townes T.M. Behringer R.R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 219-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Later in development, interactions between the β-globin promoter and the LCR would be favored. Evidence for DNA looping comes from studies of the long range activity of the chick β/ε enhancer on the β-globin gene. In this case, electron microscopy has been used to document DNA looping, and looping requires the DNA architectural protein HMG I/Y (20Bagga R. Michalowski S. Sabnis R. Griffith J.D. Emerson B.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2736-2740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that the γ-globin GATA-1 and Oct-1 binding elements are not involved in β-globin suppression, which is consistent with our previous data indicating that the elements necessary for this effect are downstream of −161 (13Sargent T.G. Buller A.M. Teachey D.T. McCanna K.S. Lloyd J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).The fact that the γ-globin CACCC element has a stage-specific effect is consistent with the role of the β-globin CACCC element. Targeted gene knock-outs in mice indicate that the erythroid Krüppel-like factor exerts its effects through the proximal CACCC element in the β-globin promoter, and it is responsible for positively regulating this gene in the adult (31Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A lack of the erythroid Krüppel-like factor does not reduce γ-globin gene expression (31Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that a different protein binding to the γ-globin CACCC element has a significant role in stage-specific expression. In the future, it will be of interest to identify the transcription factor(s) that binds to the γ-globin CACCC element to elicit its stage-specific effects. Two fetal erythroid kruppel-like factors (FKLF-1 and FKLF-2) have been identified and are candidates that may have this function (34Asano H. Li X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3571-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Asano H. Li X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 3578-3584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FKLF-1 and FKLF-2 increase transcription of a γ-globin promoter-reporter gene fusion construct in transient transfection assays, and they require the CACCC element for this activity. DNA binding assays have not been performed to demonstrate that either FKLF-1 or FKLF-2 binds to the γ-globin CACCC element. The factors do not appear to be specific for the γ-globin gene because they increase ε- and β-globin gene transcription as well. Further work will need to be done to determine whether one of these factors or some other factor(s) is responsible for the stage-specific activity of the γ-globin CACCC element.In adult mice with the HS3HS2γβ construct, the γ-globin gene is not silenced to the same extent as it is in the native locus in humans. This has previously been observed with other constructs (10Enver T. Raich N. Ebens A.J. Papayannopoulou T. Costantini F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 12Lloyd J.A. Krakowsky J.M. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Behringer R.R. Ryan T.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). There are several possible explanations for this finding. It is possible that an element necessary for adult silencing is absent from the HS3HS2γβ construct. The shorter than normal distance between the LCR elements and the γ-globin gene in this construct may reduce silencing. It is also possible that HS3 and HS2, in the absence of HS1 and/or HS4, are not sufficient to correctly down-regulate the γ-globin gene in the adult.The competition model for the developmental regulation of the human γ- and β-globin genes is consistent with a mechanism of interactions between the genes and the LCR via a looping model, a linking model, or both. The finding that the γ-globin CACCC and TATA elements are both necessary for competition does not distinguish whether looping and/or linking occurs, but it does add some structure to the model for globin gene switching. If looping is a major mechanism in establishing the enhancer activity of the LCR, then factors binding to the γ-globin CACCC and TATA elements are required to establish protein-protein interactions with factors binding to the LCR, thereby forming an LCR-γ-globin gene loop. If linking is the major mechanism, then when the γ-globin CACCC and TATA elements are occupied, this inhibits the ability of protein complexes to establish a complete connection along the chromatin between the LCR and the β-globin gene. For example, binding of factors to the γ-globin CACCC and TATA elements could change the chromatin conformation so that the linking complexes could not bind to the DNA between the γ- and the β-globin genes. Alternatively, since the binding of CACCC and TATA factors facilitates transcription of the γ-globin gene, transcription may in turn diminish looping or linking between the LCR and the β-globin gene. Whether looping, linking, or some other mechanism is involved, β-like globin gene regulation must depend on the presence of stage-specific factors, such as CACCC-binding proteins, to establish whether LCR-γ-globin or LCR-β-globin gene interactions are favored. These data demonstrate that the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements are essential for coordinate regulation of the γ- and β-globin genes in development. According to the competition model, transcription of the γ-globin gene early in development precludes the expression of the β-globin gene because the γ-globin promoter directly or indirectly engages the LCR, limiting interactions between the LCR and the β-globin gene (18Engel J.D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Townes T.M. Behringer R.R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 219-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We had previously shown that elements downstream of −161, including the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements, are important for suppression of the β-globin gene in embryonic/fetal erythroid cells. In this work, we confirm these results in an in vivo developmental system, demonstrate that the γ-globin TATA and CACCC are the major regulators of embryonic β-globin silencing, show that these elements function coordinately, and establish that the CACCC element has stage-specific effects in γ- to β-globin switching. The results indicate that the γ-globin TATA element is required both for normal levels of embryonic transcription and for initiation of transcription at the appropriate site. Data from transgenic mice and transfected cells indicate that both the TATA and CACCC elements are required in order for the γ-globin gene to most effectively inhibit β-globin gene expression in early development. Experiments in transfected HEL cells show that the TATA and CACCC elements are the major γ-globin promoter elements responsible for β-globin suppression in early development. In previous work, we studied an HS2γΔtsβ construct in transgenic mice (13Sargent T.G. Buller A.M. Teachey D.T. McCanna K.S. Lloyd J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In three lines of HS2γΔtsβ mice, the percentage of β-globin expression compared with mouse β-like globin at 10.5 dpc were 6, 21, and 21%. In 5 lines of HS2γβ mice, there was between 0.0 and 1.4% β-globin expression at 10.5 dpc. The average % β-globin expression at 10.5 dpc is 10.3 for the lines with HS3HS2γT/Cβ and 0.8 for the HS3HS2γβ mice. This emphasizes that the fold effect of the T/C mutation is similar to that of the Δts mutation. In comparing the expression of constructs with mutations in the two elements to those with the single mutations, there is at least an additive effect on increasing the β/γ globin mRNA ratio in HEL cells, and this effect is even more evident in an in vivodevelopmental system in embryonic and fetal transgenic mice. This suggests that the proteins binding to the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements can work independently but coordinate to establish a greater effect on the regulation of globin gene developmental switching. The data indicate that the γ-globin TATA and CACCC elements each have different roles. Transgenic mouse experiments show that the γ-globin TATA element plays a role in γ-globin expression and β-globin suppression in the embryo and fetus; in contrast, the CACCC element has a stage-specific effect in the fetus. Ryan et al. (30Ryan T.M. Sun C.W. Ren J. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2736-2740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) studied the effects of a mutation in the γ-globin CACCC element on the human β/γ-globin mRNA ratio in the yolk sac of transgenic mice. Their results differed from the data presented here in that they observed an increased β/γ globin mRNA ratio in the yolk sac, whereas in our experiments the ratio was not increased at 10.5 days but was increased at 14.5 days. However, qualitative inspection of their data shows that the β/γ ratio is much higher at 14.5 than at 10.5 dpc and that their CACCC mutation appears to affect γ-globin transcription at 14.5 and not 10.5 dpc, which is consistent with the stage-specific effects described here. Most importantly, in the current work, the CACCC and TATA mutations are compared, demonstrating that both are important for β-globin gene silencing but that the CACCC element is unique in that it has a stage-specific effect. Ryan et al. (30Ryan T.M. Sun C.W. Ren J. Townes T.M.

There are many examples of proteins, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, in which a histidine is phosphorylated at one of these positions. It has been estimated that phosphohistidine may account for up to 6% of total protein phosphorylations in eukaryotic cells (1Matthews H.R. Pharmacol. Therap. 1995; 67: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylations involving phosphohistidines are much more prominent than other phosphoamino acids in organisms such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (2Waygood E.B. Mattoo R.L. Peri K.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 25: 139-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that utilize sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS).2 Estimates of the concentrations of the PTS proteins and enzymes (3Matto R.L. Khandelwal R.L. Waygood E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) suggest that internal concentrations of phosphohistidines might exceed 0.2 mm under certain physiological conditions.

The PTS system is also involved in a variety of other related cellular functions, such as the regulation of uptake of non-PTS sugars (see review in Ref. 7Saier Jr., M.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), chemotaxis (see review in Ref.8Titemeyer F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and catabolite repression (see reviews in Refs. 5Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol.

Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar). The PTS is a linear arrangement of both soluble and membrane-bound phosphocarrier proteins and enzymes, which function through a series of phosphotransfer reactions with the phosphate group originating from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ultimately leading to phosphorylation of the sugar moiety. The first two reactions of the PTS involve enzyme I and histidine-containing protein (HPr), which are soluble, non-sugar-specific, energy coupling components. Two subsequent phosphotransfer reactions involve a membrane-bound, sugar-specific enzyme II. Enzyme II has three or four common functional domains, ABCD (9Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme IIC domain is a membrane-transversing domain involved in translocation, and is in some examples complexed with a similar enzyme IID domain. Except for the enzyme IIC and enzyme IID domains, all other protein and enzyme components of the PTS form phosphorylated residues at their active sites in the course of the phosphoryl transfer reactions. The enzyme IIB domain is the site of sugar phosphorylation. Most enzyme II proteins do not have an enzyme IID domain, and in these the phosphoamino acid formed in the enzyme IIB domain is a phosphocysteine (10Pas H.H. Meyer G.H. Kruizinga W.H. Tamminga K.S. van Weeghel R.P. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6690-6692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In enzyme II, in which an enzyme IID domain is found, the enzyme IIB domain forms a [Nδ1–P]histidine. The enzyme IIA domain is phosphorylated to form a [Nε2–P]histidine, at residue 90 (11), HPr has a [Nδ1–P]histidine, at residue 15 (12, 13), and enzyme I a [Nε2–P]histidine, at residue 189 (14Weigel N. Kukuruzinska M.A. Nakazawa T. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14477-14491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions of the PTS, involving phosphotransfer from PEP to sugar-P are presented below in Equations Eq. 1, Eq. 2, Eq. 3, Eq. 4, Eq. 5.phosphoenolpyruvate+enzyme I↔pyruvate+P­enzyme IEq. 1 P­enzyme I+HPr↔enzyme I+P­HPrEq. 2 P­HPr+EIIAsugar↔P­EIIAsugar+HPrEq. 3 P­EIIAsugar+EIIBsugar↔EIIAsugar+P­EIIBsugarEq. 4 P­EIIBsugar+sugar↔EIIBsugar+sugar­PEq. 5 In PTS with enzyme IIC and IID domains, an alternating pattern of phosphoryl transfer between the Nε2 to Nδ1to Nε2 to Nδ1 atoms of histidines is established. In PTS with only an enzyme IIC domain, the final step involves phosphocysteine. Another feature of the PTS is that the organization of the enzyme IIsugar complex varies from organism to organism and sugar-specific system to sugar-specific system. Many of the enzyme IIsugar have all their domains as a single gene product. In this study, enzyme IIAGlc is used, and it is produced as a separate and soluble gene product. The enzyme IIBCGlc is incorporated into the membrane as a separate gene product. In the PTS, transfer between phosphohistidines is well established as is transfer from [Nε2–P]histidine to cysteine. In addition, enzyme I and acetate kinase transfer phosphoryl groups through an interaction between a P-glutamyl residue in acetate kinase and the active site histidine of enzyme I (15Fox D.K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13487-13497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions between [Nε2–P]histidines and aspartyl residues have been well characterized in the numerous two component regulatory systems (16Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). This arrangement was mimicked when the mutant [H15D]HPr was created (17Napper S. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21776-22178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The active center His-15 of HPr can be mutated to an aspartate ([H15D]HPr) and retain phosphotransfer abilities from EI to EIIAGlc, although at reduced efficiency (17Napper S. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21776-22178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Other substitutions, including cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, and glutamate failed to show any phosphotransfer activity. The ability for aspartate to act as a functional substitution for the His-15 Nδ1 phosphorylation was rationalized on the basis of the similar geometric positioning of the aspartyl carboxyl oxygen atom with the Nδ1 atom of histidine. Crystallographic determinations of both the wild type and [H15D]HPrs verified the positioning of the aspartate carboxyl to within an Angstrom of the relative position of the Nδ1 atom of the His-15 imidazole in the wild type structure (17Napper S. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21776-22178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this investigation we determine the potential for functional substitutions of the active center histidines of enzyme I and enzyme IIAGlc. We demonstrate a pattern of functional substitution of aspartates for histidines that undergo Nδ1phosphorylation and glutamates for histidines that undergo Nε2 phosphorylation. Mutants were prepared by a number of methods as previously described (18Anderson J.W. Pullen K. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol.

Isolation of the phosphorylated forms of both the wild type and [H15D]HPr were performed using anion-exchange chromatography in conjuncture with anAmersham Pharmacia Biotech Gradifrac system. Phosphorylation reaction mixtures containing 0.20 mg of HPr or [H15D]HPr and 5 μg of enzyme I were loaded onto a 1 ml mini Q-Sepharose column. The reaction mixture was loaded with 10 mm HEPES buffer pH 7.5, and the column was eluted at 4 ml/min with a 30-ml gradient to 0.1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and protein elution was monitored at 214 nm. Approximately one-half of the wild type and a third of the [H15D]HPr was isolated in the phosphorylated form in a 1 ml volume.

Zanolari B. Graff P. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and introduced into pT7-7(21) creating pT7-7.crr (17Napper S. Delbaere L.T.J.

Large scale overexpression and preparation of crude extracts was identical to that described for enzyme I (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.H. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Purification of enzyme IIAGlc and mutants was based on the methods previously described (11Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14526-14537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 75 ml of the crude supernatant was applied to a 300 ml Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (3.0 cm × 25 cm), which had been equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm p-aminobenzamidine. The column was then eluted using a 2-liter salt gradient of 0–0.5 m KCl and fractions of 10 ml were collected. Fractions containing EIIAGlc were determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). EIIAGlc and mutants were estimated to be >90% pure judged by inspection of SDS-PAGE gels. Appropriate fractions were then pooled and dialyzed overnight against water. Samples were aliquoted and frozen at −20 °C (25Napper S. Phosphorylation Sites of HPrPh.D. thesis. University of Saskatchewan, Canada1999Google Scholar). [32P]PEP was made by the incubation of 0.2 mCi, of [γ32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mg of homogeneous E. coli phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (provided by Dr. Hughes Goldie, University of Saskatchewan), 1 mm ATP, 12.5 mm KF, 5.0 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm oxaloacetate in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) in a final volume of 250 μl at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was initiated with the addition of oxaloacetate (25Napper S. Phosphorylation Sites of HPrPh.D. thesis. University of Saskatchewan, Canada1999Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped and stored with freezing at −20 °C. The preparation was used without further purification. Phosphorylation reactions consisted of 5 mmMgCl2, 25 μm [32P]PEP (specific activity 800 mCi/mol), and 50 mm HEPES buffer pH 7.5 in a 20-μl volume. Protein concentrations of 5 μg of enzyme I, 10 μg of HPr, and 20 μg of enzyme IIAGlc were used in all experiments, except were indicated. Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was halted with the addition of 2× SDS loading buffer and electrophoresed through a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Following the run the gels were covered with commercial food wrap, and exposed to x-ray film for 12 h at −80 °C (2Waygood E.B. Mattoo R.L. Peri K.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 25: 139-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry was performed using a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager ELITE matrix-assisted laser diode ionization-time of flight spectrometer at the Plant Biotechnology Institute. Samples were run in linear mode. Sugar phosphorylation assays were performed as described (27Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in a total volume of 0.05 ml containing 0.05m potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm[U-14C]glucose (105 cpm/mol), 2.0 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5 KF, 10 mm PEP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg HPr, 0.4–1 unit of enzyme IIMan, from SB2950 membranes, as well as varying amounts of enzyme I. The assays were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of ice-cold water. The mixtures were loaded onto 1.5 ml columns containing AG1 × 2 (50–100 mesh, Cl− form) anion exchange resin equilibrated with water. The columns were washed twice with 5 ml of 1 m LiCl, into scintillation vials fitted 10 ml Nalgene filmware bags. Six milliliters of liquid scintillation mixture was added, and the bags were sealed, shaken, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Methods have been described for protein determinations (18Anderson J.W. Pullen K. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol.

The following substitutions for His-189 in E. coli enzyme I were made: aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Each purified mutant was incubated under the phosphorylation conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” either with or without wild type HPr (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation potential of the [H189C]EI mutant was also examined in the absence of dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol. Phosphorylation of the active center cysteine of enzyme IIBGlc is not detectable in the presence of dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol. 3E. B. Waygood, unpublished result. Only wild type and [H189E]EI are capable of autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of HPr. The catalytic activity of [H189E]EI mutant was assessed using the lactate dehydrogenase coupled spectrophotometric assay (27Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation of EI from phosphoenolpyruvate results in a stoichimetric production of pyruvate, which can be coupled to the lactate dehydrogenase reaction. However, even when up to 1 mg of enzyme I was used in an assay that gave maximal activity for the wild type enzyme, no activity for the mutant was detected, and thus no kinetic parameters could be obtained. In the experience of this laboratory, the lactate dehydrogenase assay has a sensitivity limit for EI mutants that retain ∼0.01% of wild type activity. In the sugar phosphorylation assays serial dilutions were performed to determine the limit of detectable activity for enzyme I and H189E enzyme I. Detectable activity was defined as double background. Under this criteria, wild type enzyme I could be detected to femtomolar concentrations while [H189E]enzyme I to nanomolar concentrations. The H189E mutant of enzyme I therefore has ∼0.001% of the phosphotransfer activity of the wild type protein. All the other active site mutants of enzyme I failed to promote sugar phosphorylation. The following substitutions for His-90 in E. coliEIIAGlc were made: aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Each mutant EIIAGlc protein was incubated under phosphorylation conditions with both wild type EI and HPr. Only the wild type and H90E mutant of enzyme IIAGlcdemonstrated phosphorylation (Fig.2). The difference in migration of the wild type and H90E enzyme IIAGlc proteins is not due to differences in molecular mass. The mass of the wild type enzyme IIAGlc protein is 18,131 Da and the H90E mutant of enzyme EIIAGlc is 18,120 Da as determined by mass spectrometry (data not shown). This difference in mass corresponds with that predicted by the mutation. The doublet seen in phosphorylation of wild type enzyme IIAGlc results from the removal of seven residues from the N terminus of the protein as a consequence of an endopeptidase reaction that sometimes occurs in purification. The modification does not affect the ability of the protein to act as a phosphoacceptor (37Pelton J. Torchia D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5215-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation potential of the H90C EIIAGlc mutant was also examined in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol. None of the other mutations of EIIAGlc demonstrated phosphorylation. It was noted however, that in the reaction mixture containing H90D EIIAGlc there was reduced levels of phosphorylation of both the enzyme I and HPr proteins, as compared with the other phosphorylation reaction mixtures. This could imply that the [32P]PEP was being depleted from the reaction mixture. Possibly the H90D mutant of EIIAGlc is able to undergo phosphorylation to form a highly labile phosphoacyl product. Rapid turnover of phosphorylation would account for the reduced levels of phosphorylation of the enzyme I and HPr proteins. However a lactate dehydrogenase coupled spectrophotometric assay comparing turnover rates of phosphorylation in mixtures containing EI (10 μg), HPr (20 μg), and either wild type, H90T, or H90D EIIAGlc (0.5 mg) failed to demonstrate increased rates of PEP utilization in the mixture containing [H90D]EIIAGlc as compared with [H90T]EIIAGlc. This indicates that the [H90D]EIIAGlc does not undergo phosphorylation to create an unstable phosphoacyl but possibly forms an abortive complex with the other PTS proteins limiting their phosphorylation. The potential for phosphotransfer between mutant enzyme I and mutant HPr proteins was investigated. A complete investigation of all combinations of the mutants (aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, serine, threonine, and tyrosine) of both His-189 enzyme I and His-15 HPr was performed. Only the acidic substitutions demonstrated successful phosphotransfer and thus only these results are presented. As previously demonstrated, wild type enzyme I is able to phosphorylate both wild type and [H15D]HPr but not [H15E]HPr. The H189E mutant of enzyme I is also able to phosphorylate both wild type and [H15D]HPr (Fig. 3). The ability of phosphorylated [H15D]HPr to transfer the phosphoryl group to both wild type and [H90E]EIIAGlcwas further investigated. To be certain that phosphotransfer was occurring from phospho-HPr and not enzyme I or a contaminating protein, the phosphorylated forms of both HPr or [H15D]HPr were isolated from a phosphorylated reaction mixture. The procedure for this isolation using anion exchange chromatography techniques has been described (17Napper S. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21776-22178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The isolated phospho-HPr or phospho-[H15D]HPr was incubated with either wild type or one of the mutant enzyme IIAGlcproteins (Fig. 4). Both the phosphorylated forms of wild type as well as [H15D]HPr were able to mediate phosphotransfer to both wild type and [H90E]enzyme IIAGlc. Phosphotransfer by the first three proteins of the PTS where the active center histidines have been mutated to an acidic amino acid, glutamate for EI and EIIAGlc, aspartate for HPr was demonstrated (Fig.5). Phosphorylation from [H189E]enzyme I to [H15D]HPr to [H90E]EIIAGlc confirms the potential for substitution of histidines that undergo phosphorylation with either aspartates or glutamates. Phosphorylation at the Nδ1 or Nε2imidazole nitrogens of histidine residues is found in many proteins; ATP-citrate lyase (28Williams S.P. Sykes B.D. Bridger W.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), phosphoglycerate mutase (29Pilkis S.J. Lively M.R. el-Maghrabi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12672-12675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), isocitrate lyase (30Robertson E.F. Hoyt J.C. Reeves H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2477-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CheA (31Stock J. Ninfa A. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), diphosphoglycerate kinase (32Rose Z.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (33Colomb M.G. Cheruy A. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3378-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to name some. In most cases, the phosphohistidine functions as a high-energy intermediate mediating the passage of a phosphoryl group from a donor to an acceptor molecule. The bacterial PTS is functionally composed of a series of phosphotransfer reactions; enzyme I, HPr, and enzyme IIAsugar, representing the sequence of the first three phosphotransfer proteins. Phosphorylation of these proteins occurs on histidine residues involving phosphorylations of both the Nε2 and Nδ1 atoms; Nε2 for enzyme I and enzyme IIsugar and Nδ1 for HPr. The pattern of phosphotransfer between these PTS proteins therefore proceeds from Nε2 to Nδ1 to Nε2, and to Nδ1 for some EIIBsugar domains. His-15 in HPr can be substituted with an aspartate and retain the ability for phosphorylation by enzyme I and phosphotransfer to enzyme IIAGlc. It was proposed that the success of this mutation was due to comparable geometric positioning of the carboxyl oxygen of aspartate to the Nδ1 atom of histidine (Fig.6) (17Napper S. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21776-22178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Glutamate has comparable geometric positioning of the Oε2 carboxyl oxygen to the Nε2 atom of histidine suggesting that glutamate may be a functional substitution for histidines, which undergo phosphorylation of the Nε2 atom such as in enzyme I (Fig. 7) and enzyme IIAGlc (Fig. 8).Figure 8Modeling of the H90E mutant of enzyme IIAGlc. The active center of the wild type enzyme IIAGlc 2.1 Å x-ray structure (26Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Liao D.I. Herzberg O. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10382-10386Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) superimposed on the model of the [H90E]enzyme IIAGlc. The mutation was modeled by manual introduction of the substitution followed by 40 rounds of least squares refinement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similarly it has been previously noted that asparagine, but not glutamine, may substitute for histidines that are required to hydrogen bond from the Nδ1 atom (34Lowe D.M. Fersht A.R. Wilkinson A.J. Carter P. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5106-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The side chain of the asparagine residue may be superimposed such that the asparagine amide group aligns with the Nδ1 amide of the imidazole ring. [H189E]EI proved to be the only substitution able to accept a phosphoryl group from PEP and complete phosphotransfer to HPr. The lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay failed to detect measurable activity, indicating that the residual activity was less than 0.01% of wild type. In a more sensitive sugar phosphorylation assay utilizing membranes from a strain deficient in enzyme I it was possible to demonstrate sugar phosphorylation, which was dependent upon the addition of active enzyme I. The H189E mutant of enzyme I was estimated to have a level of phosphotransfer ability of ∼0.001% that of wild type. The characterization of numerous other His-189 mutants of enzyme I, which do not display any activity, verifies that the EI-deficient strain contains no contaminating EI activity as previously demonstrated (23Brokx S.J. Talbot J. Georges F. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3624-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, for the mutations of active center His-90 of enzyme IIAGlc, only the H90E mutation could be phosphorylated. The diminished ability to detect phosphoproteins in reactions containing H90D enzyme IIAGlc suggested that perhaps this mutant had a spontaneous autophosphohydrolysis activity which we have described for [H15D]HPr (17Napper S. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21776-22178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Such autophosphohydrolysis activity is also apparent in the two component system e.g., CheY-P has a phosphoaspartyl with a half-life of minutes in the presence of Mg2+ (35Hess J.F. Oowasa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This appears not to be the case for [H90D]EIIAGlc. Also, [H15D]HPr, in the process of dephosphorylation spontaneously forms a protein modification, an isoimide, involving the aspartyl residue (17Napper S. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21776-22178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the inability to detect turnover through a lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay suggests that this particular mutant of EIIAGlc interferes with the ability of EI and HPr to phosphorylation, possibly through the formation of an inactive complex. In this study, the activities of the phosphotransfer reactions utilizing the phosphoacyl derivatives are poor and concerns about contaminating wild type proteins mediating some of the events are addressed here. The proteins and enzymes were expressed in strains that contained suitable mutations. HPr mutants were overproduced in a ptsH strain in which a terminator codon occurs at residue 71 4J. Lenegler, personal communication. and in which no HPr activity or protein can be detected (38Waygood E.B. Reiche B. Henstenberg W. Lee J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2810-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HPr preparations could not be phosphorylated without the addition of enzyme I. Enzyme IIAGlc mutants were purified from a Δpts-HIcrrstrain, phosphorylation of expressed wild type enzyme IIAGlc was dependent on the addition of both enzyme I and HPr. Similarly enzyme I mutants were expressed in a ptsIstrain (23Brokx S.J. Talbot J. Georges F. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3624-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the purified enzymes with [32P]PEP did not reveal any other phosphoproteins present. This however, does not eliminate the possibility of trace amounts of wild type HPr being present and to catalytically shuffle between enzyme I and enzyme IIAGlc mutants. For this reason, P-HPrs were isolated from enzyme I incubation mixtures to confirm, in particular, the acyl phosphate transfers. Enzyme IIAGlc preparations could not be phosphorylated without the addition of both enzyme I and HPr, indicating the enzyme IIA preparations were free of contamination by other PTS proteins. The number of results with mutants showing no phosphotransfer, a result expected from a priori considerations, provides additional controls. Lastly, the preparation of [32P]PEP was a mixture with [γ-32P]ATP. None of the results presented here could be reproduced using just [γ-32P]ATP. The creation of two mutant proteins, which are able to form a phosphoglutamyl residue is significant due to the rarity of these linkages in nature. There are few reported examples of phosphoglutamates in the literature; acetate kinase (15Fox D.K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13487-13497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and prothymosin alpha (36Trumbore M.W. Wang R.H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The infrequent observation of phosphoglutamyl residues may in part be due to the instability of these linkages. Phosphotransfer from histidine to histidine (such as in the PTS), as well as transfer from phosphohistidines to aspartyl residues as seen in two-component systems (31Stock J. Ninfa A. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is well established. The single example of transfer from phosphoglutamate to histidines is acetate kinase to enzyme I (15Fox D.K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13487-13497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We believe there are no examples described in which phosphotransfer occurs between two acidic residues, either phosphoaspartyl to glutamate or phosphoglutamyl to aspartate. Both such reactions have been demonstrated with P-[H189E]EI able to mediate phosphotransfer to [H15D]HPr, which in turn may phosphorylate [H90E]EIIAGlc. Interestingly, as PTS phosphotransfer requires transfer from Nδ1 phospholinkages to Nε2, the mutant, acidic phosphotransfers also required alternating residues. With [H15D]HPr, phosphorylation catalyzed an intramolecular rearrangement in which the phosphoaspartyl side chain cyclizes with the main-chain atoms to produce an isoimide structure. The possibility of such post-phosphorylation activity in the [H189E]enzyme I and [H90E]enzyme IIAGlc mutants is being investigated. However the additional length of the glutamate, as opposed to aspartate is expected to severely limit such rearrangements, and we have observed no evidence of cyclization of glutamates."

It is of interest to identify amino acid substitutions that result in the aberrant folding of a protein, as misfolded proteins are implicated in a number of human diseases. For example, protein misfolding and aggregation have been implicated in amyloid-related disease states such as Alzheimer's disease (4Dobson C.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) as well as in cancer via amino acid substitutions in the tumor suppressor p53 (5Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Thus, examples of amino acid substitutions that alter the folding, structure, and stability of proteins should provide a framework for the structural analysis of disease-causing mutations and in predicting the effects of some single nucleotide polymorphisms (6Sunyaev S. Lathe W. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first reported that cells infected with T7ts11 phage failed to replicate the phage DNA at elevated temperatures, and extracts of the infected cells contained a DNA polymerase activity that was more heat-labile than that in extracts of cells infected with wild-type T7 phage. T7 gene 5 protein has become a model DNA polymerase for elucidating mechanisms of DNA replication and fidelity (17Doublie S. Ellenberger T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This 80-kDa polymerase with its associated 3′-5′-exonuclease activity is by itself distributive for DNA synthesis and incorporates less than 15 nucleotides before dissociating from a primer terminus (19Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in a 1:1 complex with a host protein, Escherichia colithioredoxin, gene 5 protein processively catalyzes the addition of thousands of nucleotides at rates approaching 300 nucleotides per second (19Tabor S.

The gene 5 protein-thioredoxin complex will be referred to as T7 DNA polymerase in this manuscript. Identification of mutations in T7 DNA polymerase that impart temperature sensitivity is of interest not only for structure-function studies but also for locating amino acid residues and specific interactions critical to folding of the polymerase. A crystal structure of T7 DNA polymerase in a catalytically trapped complex with duplex DNA and an incoming nucleotide facilitates the interpretation of such data (24Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). To this end, the gene 5 region of T7ts11 was sequenced in its entirety. A single mutation that encodes an alanine to valine substitution at position 73 in the exonuclease domain was found to be responsible for the temperature-sensitive phenotype. Ala-73 resides in the exonuclease domain although it is not in the active site (Fig.1). Such mutations that are spatially removed from the active site and yet effect function are likely to shed light on conformation and folding of the protein. In this paper we describe in vivo studies with temperature-sensitive T7 phage strains that have different mutations at residue 73 of T7 DNA polymerase and biochemical analysis of the purified mutant T7 DNA polymerases. M13 mGP1–2 is a 9950-nt1 derivative of vector M13 mp8 that has been described earlier (25Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). The 24-nt M13 sequencing primer (−47) (5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) and oligonucleotides for in vitro mutagenesis were from Integrated DNA Technologies. The 24-nt M13 sequencing primer and M13 mGP1–2 DNA were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio (100 nm) in 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl and annealed by heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by slowly cooling to room temperature. Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of primer 3′-ends unless otherwise specified. Salmon sperm DNA (Type III) was from Sigma. Salmon sperm ssDNA was prepared by alkali denaturation of native salmon sperm DNA by incubation with 50 mm NaOH at 20 °C for 15 min, followed by neutralization with HCl. E. coli B and mRI80 (F− ΔlacU169 araD139 thiA rpsL relA Δrbs-7 pcnB80) have been described (26Studier F.W. Virology. 1969; 39: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 27Lopilato J. Bortner S. Beckwith J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). E. coli D110 (thyA endA polA1) and C600 (thi-1 thr-1 leuB6 lacY1 tonA21 supE44 mcrB) are from the laboratory collection. E. coli HMS174 (DE3) is from Novagen. Wild-type T7 and mutant T7Δ5 (gene 5 deletion) phage are from the laboratory collection. T7ts11, T7am28 and T7am196 (26Studier F.W. Virology. 1969; 39: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) phage were from Dr. F. W. Studier. T7am28 and T7am196 phage contain an amber mutation in gene 5 and have been described (26Studier F.W. Virology. 1969; 39: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Growth and manipulation of bacteriophage T7 andE. coli were carried out as described (26Studier F.W. Virology. 1969; 39: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Plasmids pGP5-A73V, pGP5-A73L, pGP5-A73I, and pGP5-A73F were constructed using standard polymerase chain reaction and cloning techniques. Two oligonucleotide primers, one with a MfeI restriction site and a second with aBamHI restriction site (5′-CGGGATCCCATATGAAGAGATTGTTAAGTCA-3′) were used to amplify 279 base pairs of the T7 DNA sequence encoding Ala-73. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-CTCGGTTCAATTGCAACTTTACCAGTTTGG-3′ (A73V), 5′-CTCGGTTCAATTGCAACTTTAGCAGTTTGG-3′ (A73L), 5′-CTCGGTTCAATTGCAACTTTATCAGTTTGG-3′ (A73I), and 5′-CTCGGTTCAATTGCAACTTGAACAGTTTGG-3′ (A73F). Sequence changes from wild-type T7 gene 5 have been underlined. Polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were di- gested with BamHI and MfeI, and the resulting fragment was ligated into theBamHI and MfeI sites of plasmid pGP5–3. Plasmid pGP5–3 and all mutant derivatives contain gene 5 protein under control of the T7 Φ10 promoter. The identity of the clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Native T7 gene 5 protein and genetically altered gene 5 proteins (gp5-A73V, gp5-A73L) were over-produced in E. coli HMS174 (DE3) cells containing plasmids pGP5–3, pGP5-A73V, and pGP5-A73L, respectively. The 1:1 complex of polymerase and thioredoxin was purified to apparent homogeneity as described (22Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. Holmgren A. Branden C.-I. Jornvall H. Sjoberg B.-M. Thioredoxin and Glutaredoxin Systems: Structure and Function. Raven Press, New York1986: 285-300Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) and were confirmed by amino acid analysis. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. ThermoSequenase was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bovine pancreatic DNase I was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to gene 5 and gene 4 proteins were from Hazelton Research Products, Inc. Unlabeled nucleotides (high pressure liquid chromatography grade) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.[33P]ddNTPs, [3H]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [methyl-3H]thymidine (25 Ci/mmol), and [α-33P]dATP (2500 Ci/mmol) were obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was diluted with dTTP to 2 cpm/pmol. [α-33P]dATP (2500 Ci/mmol) was diluted with dATP to 56 cpm/pmol. E. coli mRI80 cells were grown at 30 °C to a cell density of 6 × 108cells/ml. The cells were infected with T7ts11 phage at an m.o.i. of 5, and the infected cultures were grown for 3 h. Bovine pancreatic DNase I (0.05 μg/ml) was added, and the incubation continued another 15 min. The culture was then chilled on ice, and NaCl (125 mm) was added. The cell-lysate was centrifuged to remove cell debris. To the supernatant, PEG 8000 (United States Biochemical) was added to a final concentration of 10%, and after the sample was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h the solution was centrifuged. The pellet was redissolved in 40 ml of a 10% polyethylene glycol solution in TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0), and the solution centrifuged. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of TE and extracted with an equal volume of buffer-saturated phenol (pH 8.0):chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1). The aqueous phase was dialyzed against TE. The DNA sample was purified by anion exchange chromatography (Qiagen). Gene 5 of T7ts11 DNA was first amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-AATCGTTGCCGATAAGACCAACATGAT-3′ and 5′-CTCATCACCAGCACCATAGAG-3′, were used to amplify the 5′-end of gene 5. The 3′-end of gene 5 was amplified using primers 5′-CTAAAGGTGGCACTGAGATGTTCT-3′ and 5′-AGCAGCACCTGTTAAGTGTCTTTC-3′. Sequencing reactions were carried out with 33P-labeled ddNTPs and ThermoSequenase using 13 primers. The products of the reaction were separated by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 50% urea and then analyzed by autoradiography. Crosses were carried out at 30 °C. Plasmids pGP5-A73V, pGP5-A73I and pGP5-A73F were used to transform E. coli C600 cells, which are su+. The cells were grown to a density of 3 × 108 cells/ml and then infected with T7am28 phage at an m.o.i. of ∼5. Recombinant phage (T7tsval, T7tsile, T7tsphe) were isolated by plating onE. coli B cells, which are su−. Temperature sensitivity of the recombinant phage was determined by replica plating at 30 °C and 42 °C. All of the recombinant phage were temperature-sensitive. The gene 5 region of phage DNA was sequenced to confirm the presence of each mutation. The efficiencies of plating of T7 wild-type, T7ts11, T7tsval, T7tsile, and T7tsphe phage were measured on a lawn of E. coli B cells at various temperatures. E. coli B cells were grown to a density of 2 × 108 cells/ml. Dilutions of phage (T7, T7ts11, T7tsval, T7tsile, and T7tsphe) were mixed with 0.5 ml of cells and 3 ml of top agar (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast, 0.5% NaCl, 0.7% agar, pH 7.0) and plated on TB (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast, 0.5% NaCl, 1.5% agar, pH 7.0) plates. The plates were incubated at 25 °C, 30 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C. The plates were analyzed for plaques after 3–15 h. Plating efficiencies of T7Δ5 phage were measured on E. coli C600 cells harboring the plasmids pT7–7, pGP5–3, pGP5-A73V, pGP5-A73L, pGP5-A73I, and pGP5-A73F. Plasmid pT7–7 is the parent vector of pGP5–3 missing the gene 5 insert. Cells harboring the plasmids were grown to a density of 2 × 108 cells/ml in LB media containing 80 μg/ml ampicillin. Dilutions of phage were mixed with 0.5 ml of cells, 3 ml of top agar, and ampicillin (200 μg) and plated on TB plates. The plates were incubated at 25 °C and 42 °C and analyzed for plaques after 4 h and 20 h, respectively. DNA synthesis upon infection of E. coli C600 cells by T7 phage was measured by thymidine incorporation assays (29Saito H. Richardson C.C. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 343-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coliC600 cells were grown to a density of 3 × 108cells/ml in Davis media (0.7% potassium diphosphate, 2% potassium monophosphate, 0.05% sodium citrate, 0.01% magnesium sulfate, 0.1% ammonium sulfate) supplemented with glucose, thiamine, and casamino acids. The cells were infected with either wild-type T7 or T7tsval phage at an m.o.i. of 5. At the indicated time intervals, 200 μl of the samples were removed, and [3H]thymidine was added to the infected cells to a final concentration of 50 μCi/ml. Radioactive labeling was terminated after 90 s by the addition of 40 μl of 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 0 °C. The incorporation of [3H]dTMP was measured on DE81 filter discs as described (30Bryant F.R. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3537-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). E. coli D110 cells (25 ml) were grown to a density of 5 × 108 cells/ml. T7 wild-type or T7tsval phage was used to infect the cells at an m.o.i. of 5. The infected cultures were grown at 30 °C and 42 °C for 15 min. The cultures were then chilled on ice for 15 min. The cells were lysed by incubation with lysozyme (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C. DNA polymerase activity of purified T7 DNA polymerases was measured on primed M13 ssDNA. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 20 nm M13 mGP1–2 ssDNA annealed to a 24-nt oligonucleotide, 500 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (2 cpm/pmol), 50 μg/ml BSA, and the indicated amounts of DNA polymerase. The enzyme was pre-incubated with the primer-template in the absence of Mg2+ and nucleotides for 4 min at 22 °C, 37 °C or 42 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 7.5 μl of 66 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5. The incorporation of [3H]dTMP was measured on DE81 filter discs as described (30Bryant F.R. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3537-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Reactions at 42 °C also contained 30% glycerol. Polymerase activity in phage-infected cell-lysates was measured using salmon sperm ssDNA. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 300 μm salmon sperm ssDNA (in terms of total nucleotides), 500 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (2 cpm/pmol), 50 μg/ml BSA and the indicated amounts of phage extract. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C or 42 °C. The incorporation of [3H]dTMP was measured as described above. Wild-type T7 DNA polymerase or gp5-A73V was pre-incubated at 42 °C in 20 μl of 70 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 9 mm DTT, 90 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml BSA and 75% glycerol. At the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn, and DNA polymerase activity was measured at 37 °C on primed M13 ssDNA. Final concentrations of the components in the polymerase assay (in 50 μl) were 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 20 nm primed M13 DNA, 300 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (2 cpm/pmol), 50 μg/ml BSA, 30% glycerol and 1 nm DNA polymerase. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Heat inactivation assays with gp5-A73L were carried out under similar conditions, except the enzymes were pre-incubated at 37 °C and assayed for polymerase activity at 30 °C; the polymerase concentration was 2 nm, and there was no glycerol in the reactions. The 3′-5′-exonuclease activity of T7 DNA polymerase was measured using uniformly 3H-labeled M13 ss or dsDNA. The substrate was prepared by annealing the 24-nt oligonucleotide to M13 mGP1–2 DNA and then extending the primer in a reaction mixture (300 μl) that contained 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 50 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 100 nm T7 DNA polymerase. After incubation at 37 °C for 8 min, the DNA was extracted with an equal volume of buffer-saturated phenol (pH 8.0):chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), and the labeled DNA was purified through a Sepharose (CL-6B) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). M13 [3H]ssDNA was prepared by alkali denaturation of [3H]dsDNA by incubation with 50 mm NaOH at 20 °C for 15 min, followed by neutralization with HCl. The enzymes were pre-incubated with DNA in the absence of Mg2+ for 4 min at 22 °C, 37 °C, or 42 °C, and then the reactions were initiated by the addition of Mg2+. The pre-incubation mixture (45 μl) contained 1.1 nmol3H-labeled M13 ss or dsDNA (in terms of total nucleotides). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 100 mm MgCl2. Final concentrations were 1 nmol3H-labeled M13 ss or dsDNA (in terms of total nucleotides), 0.02–0.4 nm DNA polymerase, and 10 mmMgCl2. Reactions also contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 μg/ml BSA. Reaction mixtures incubated at 42 °C also contained 30% glycerol. After 10 min at 22 °C, 37 °C, or 42 °C, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 30 μl BSA (10 mg/ml) and 30 μl of trichloroacetic acid (100% w/v). After incubation at 0 °C for 15 min, precipitated DNA was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min. The acid-soluble radioactivity was counted by scintillation counting in UltraGold Fluor (Packard). The rate of hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates to the corresponding monophosphate (turnover) during DNA synthesis was measured using primed M13 ssDNA and [α-33P]dATP. The reaction mixture for turnover assays was essentially the same as for polymerase assays with primed M13 DNA. Reactions contained 1 nm polymerase and 30% glycerol. Incorporation of [α-33P]dAMP into the primer strand was measured as described for polymerase assays. The amount of [α-33P]dAMP obtained upon exonucleolytic hydrolysis was quantified by TLC. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was applied to a polyethylenimine plate (JT Baker) and predeveloped with distilled water. The thin layer plate was developed with 0.6m LiCl in 1 m formic acid. [α-33P]dAMP formed was measured using phosphorimage analysis with a Fuji BAS 1000 bio-imaging analyzer. T7ts11 is a temperature-sensitive mutant of phage T7 that carries a mutation in gene 5 that renders the DNA polymerase heat-labile relative to wild-type T7 DNA polymerase (16Grippo P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the mutations in gene 5 responsible for this phenotype, T7ts11 phage DNA was purified, and its gene 5 region sequenced. T7ts11 has two point mutations; a C to T transition at nucleotide 218 of gene 5 (base pair 14,570 in the T7 genome) and a G to A transition at nucleotide 1445 of gene 5 (base pair 15,797 in the T7 genome). These two point mutations result in two amino acid substitutions in T7 DNA polymerase: codon 73, alanine (GCA) to valine (GTA), and codon 482, arginine (CGC) to histidine (CAC), where the mutations are shown in bold. To assess the contribution of each mutation in conferring temperature sensitivity to T7ts11 phage, the mutations were separated by recombination. The gene 5 mutation in the codon for residue 482 was introduced into the T7 chromosome by recombination between T7am196 phage and the plasmid encoded gene 5. T7am196 phage carries an amber mutation in gene 5 and consequently does not plate efficiently on su− hosts. The amber mutation is the result of a change in codon 540 from ATT, coding for isoleucine, to TAG, a termination codon. 2S. Tabor and C. C. Richardson, unpublished result. Recombination between the T7am196 phage and a homologous region on the plasmid containing the wild-type sequence at the codon for residue 540 can be observed directly by the increase in plating efficiency of the phage on a suppressor-free strain (31Campbell J.L. Richardson C.C. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2276-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since the codon for residue 482 is near the amber mutation at the codon for residue 540, the two mutations will be tightly linked and most of the recombinant phage that plate on a suppressor-free strain will have the mutation at residue 482. While phage mutants carrying the R482H mutation were not temperature-sensitive, phage mutants carrying the A73V mutation were as temperature-sensitive as the parent strain (data not shown). Thus, all the studies reported here have been carried out with mutants of phage T7 and mutant T7 DNA polymerases that contain substitutions only at codon 73. To analyze the role of residue 73 in T7 DNA polymerase, we constructed four mutants in which its codon, which normally codes for alanine, was changed to code for either valine, leucine, isoleucine, or phenylalanine. The ability of each of these mutant proteins produced from a plasmid to complement the growth of a T7 phage deleted for gene 5 (T7Δ5) was determined at 25 °C and 42 °C (Table I). In the absence of gene 5, no phage were detected at either 25 °C or 42 °C, since the phage requires T7 DNA polymerase for growth (26Studier F.W. Virology. 1969; 39: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). At 25 °C, all four mutants produced plaques at the same efficiency as with the plasmid expressing the wild-type gene 5. When residue 73 is changed to valine, isoleucine or phenylalanine, the plaques were the same size as when residue 73 was alanine (wild-type). In contrast, when residue 73 was leucine, the plaques were significantly smaller than those produced with the wild-type gene 5. At 42 °C, the only gene 5 mutant that complemented the growth of T7 phage is the one in which residue 73 was valine; the plaques produced were the same size as those observed with wild-type gene 5. Thus the gene 5 mutation responsible for the temperature-sensitive phenotype of T7ts11 (alanine 73 to valine) does not manifest a temperature-sensitive phenotype when it is produced from a plasmid. A likely explanation for this is the higher expression of gene 5 from a plasmid than from the T7 chromosome due to the high copy number of the plasmid. To study the effect of lower concentrations of these mutant proteins on temperature sensitivity of phage growth, we introduced each of these four mutations back into gene 5 on the T7 chromosome.Table IAbility of gene 5 plasmids to complement T7 phage growthPlasmidAmino acid substitutionEfficiency of plating25 °C 1-aPlates were incubated overnight.42 °C 1-bPlates were incubated for 4 h and prewarmed to 42 °C before use.pT7–7No gene 5<10−6<10−6pGP5–3Wild-type1.01.0pGP5-A73VAla-73 to Val1.01.0pGP5-A73LAla-73 to Leu1.01-cSmaller plaques were observed even at 25 °C.<10−6pGP5-A73IAla-73 to Ile1.0<10−5pGP5-A73FAla-73 to Phe1.0<10−5Plating efficiencies of T7Δ5 phage on E. coli C600 were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures”.

Gene 5 mutations in the codon for residue 73 were introduced into the T7 chromosome by recombination between T7am28 phage and each plasmid-encoded gene 5. T7am28 phage carries an amber mutation in gene 5. The amber mutation is the result of a change in codon 141 from GAC, coding for aspartic acid, to TAG, a termination codon.2 If the mutation at the codon for residue 73 is lethal for phage growth, then all of the viable recombinants will be T7 phage that have picked up the wild-type allele corresponding to the codon for residue 141 from the plasmid but have had a cross-over event between residues 73 and 141, and thus retain the wild-type allele at residue 73.

https://openalex.org/W1978395905,"During the early phase of adenovirus infection, the promoter-proximal L1 poly(A) site in the major late transcription unit is used preferentially despite the fact that the distal L3 poly(A) site is stronger (i.e. it competes better for processing factors and is cleaved at a faster rate, in vitro). Previous work had established that this was due at least in part to the stable binding of the processing factor, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor, to the L1 poly(A) site as mediated by specific regulatory sequences. It is now demonstrated that in addition, the L1 poly(A) site has a positional advantage because of its 5' location in the transcription unit. We also show that preferential processing of a particular poly(A) site in a complex transcription unit is dependent on RNA polymerase II. Our results are consistent with recent reports demonstrating that the processing factors cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor and cleavage stimulatory factor are associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme; thus, processing at a weak poly(A) site like L1 can be enhanced by virtue of its being the first site to be transcribed."
