Induction of the p62 gene by oxidative stress is mediated by NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and, at the same time, p62 protein contributes to the activation of NRF2, but hitherto the mechanisms involved were not known. Herein, we have mapped an antioxidant response element (ARE) in the p62 promoter that is responsible for its induction by oxidative stress via NRF2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel mobility-shift assays verified that NRF2 binds to this cis-element in vivo and in vitro. Also, p62 docks directly onto the Kelch-repeat domain of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), via a motif designated the KEAP1 interacting region (KIR), thereby blocking binding between KEAP1 and NRF2 that leads to ubiquitylation and degradation of the transcription factor. The KIR motif in p62 is located immediately C-terminal to the LC3-interacting region (LIR) and resembles the ETGE motif utilized by NRF2 for its interaction with KEAP1. KIR is required for p62 to stabilize NRF2, and inhibition of KEAP1 by p62 occurs from a cytoplasmic location within the cell. The LIR and KIR motifs cannot be engaged simultaneously by LC3 and KEAP1, but because p62 is polymeric the interaction between KEAP1 and p62 leads to accumulation of KEAP1 in p62 bodies, which is followed by autophagic degradation of KEAP1. Our data explain how p62 contributes to activation of NRF2 target genes in response to oxidative stress through creating a positive feedback loop.

https://openalex.org/W2149591661,"As the human life span increases, the number of people suffering from cognitive decline is rising dramatically. The mechanisms underlying age-associated memory impairment are, however, not understood. Here we show that memory disturbances in the aging brain of the mouse are associated with altered hippocampal chromatin plasticity. During learning, aged mice display a specific deregulation of histone H4 lysine 12 (H4K12) acetylation and fail to initiate a hippocampal gene expression program associated with memory consolidation. Restoration of physiological H4K12 acetylation reinstates the expression of learning-induced genes and leads to the recovery of cognitive abilities. Our data suggest that deregulated H4K12 acetylation may represent an early biomarker of an impaired genome-environment interaction in the aging mouse brain."

The diverse cellular properties in different cells have been attributed to their distinct epigenomes, but how much epigenomes differ remains unclear. Here, we report that epigenomic landscapes in hESCs and lineage-committed cells are drastically different. By comparing the chromatin-modification profiles and DNA methylomes in hESCs and primary fibroblasts, we find that nearly one-third of the genome differs in chromatin structure. Most changes arise from dramatic redistributions of repressive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks, which form blocks that significantly expand in fibroblasts. A large number of potential regulatory sequences also exhibit a high degree of dynamics in chromatin modifications and DNA methylation. Additionally, we observe novel, context-dependent relationships between DNA methylation and chromatin modifications. Our results provide new insights into epigenetic mechanisms underlying properties of pluripotency and cell fate commitment.

Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts.Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11501) Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanisms of pluripotency and cell fate commitment have not been completely understood. At least two models account for differences between pluripotent stem cells and lineage-committed cells. In the first, “master switches” activate distinct networks of transcription factors that govern the transcriptional program of each cell type and dictate cellular properties (Marson et al., 2008Marson A. Levine S.S. Cole M.F. Frampton G.M. Brambrink T. Johnstone S. Guenther M.G. Johnston W.K. Wernig M. Newman J. et al.Connecting microRNA genes to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 134: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). For example, the OCT4/SOX2/NANOG network enables self-renewal properties of ESCs, and ectopic expression of these factors together with additional transcription factors reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent cells (iPSCs) (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

Stewart R. et al.Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells.Science. 2007; 318: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (7579) Google Scholar). But the efficiency of reprogramming is low, suggesting the involvement of additional factors or mechanisms. Additionally, lineage-committed cells are stable over many cell divisions, after the initial master switch transcription factors are no longer expressed. Such a phenomenon, referred to as “cellular memory,” has been difficult to explain by the transcription factor network model (Ringrose and Paro, 2004Ringrose L. Paro R. Epigenetic regulation of cellular memory by the Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Another model for cellular memory involves the cell's epigenomic landscape consisting of covalent modifications to DNA or histones (Ringrose and Paro, 2004Ringrose L. Paro R. Epigenetic regulation of cellular memory by the Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), which either enable or prevent parts of the genome to be active in different cell types. In stem cells, the epigenome is highly malleable and responsive (Meshorer and Misteli, 2006Meshorer E. Misteli T. Chromatin in pluripotent embryonic stem cells and differentiation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), unlike that of somatic cells. Multiple lines of evidence support this model. First, ESCs have a higher number of “bivalent” or “poised” promoters marking important developmental regulators compared to differentiated cells, as indicated by the repressive mark histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and the active chromatin modification H3K4me3 (Azuara et al., 2006Azuara V.

Second, immunofluorescent imaging showed that after differentiation, mouse ESCs display increased heterochomatin in the nucleus (Meshorer and Misteli, 2006Meshorer E. Misteli T. Chromatin in pluripotent embryonic stem cells and differentiation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Additionally, depletion of the Jmjd1a and Jmjd2c demethylases for the heterochromatin modification H3K9me3 results in stem cell differentiation (Loh et al., 2007Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X. George J. Ng H.H. Jmjd1a and Jmjd2c histone H3 Lys 9 demethylases regulate self-renewal in embryonic stem cells.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2545-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Third, DNA methylation is found at the promoters of critical pluripotency genes such as Oct4 during differentiation and is responsible to keep such genes silent in differentiated cells (Ben-Shushan et al., 1993Ben-Shushan E. Pikarsky E. Klar A. Bergman Y. Extinction of Oct-3/4 gene expression in embryonal carcinoma x fibroblast somatic cell hybrids is accompanied by changes in the methylation status, chromatin structure, and transcriptional activity of the Oct-3/4 upstream region.Mol.

Sequential DNA methylation of the Nanog and Oct-4 upstream regions in human NT2 cells during neuronal differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6257-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recent large-scale analyses of DNA methylation and histone modifications revealed dynamic chromatin states and DNA methylation status at promoters and most CpG islands (Brunner et al., 2009Brunner A.L. Johnson D.S. Kim S.W. Valouev A. Reddy T.E. Neff N.F. Anton E. Medina C. Nguyen L.

Jaffe D.B. et al.Genome-scale DNA methylation maps of pluripotent and differentiated cells.Nature. 2008; 454: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar), showing that the methylation state of H3K4 is a good indicator of promoter DNA methylation levels in mammalian cells. This is consistent with prior studies indicating that H3K4 methylation disrupts DNA methylation by inhibiting contact of DNMTs with histones, whereas promoters marked only with H3K27me3 in mouse ESCs are more likely to exhibit de novo DNA methylation after differentiation (Meissner et al., 2008Meissner A. Mikkelsen T.S. Gu H. Wernig M. Hanna J. Sivachenko A. Zhang X. Bernstein B.E. Nusbaum C.

Cell. 2008; 30: 755-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Although these insights suggest potential mechanisms of epigenetic regulation at promoters, the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms outside of promoters remains largely unclear. To obtain a better understanding of the epigenomic landscapes in the pluripotent and differentiated cell states and explore the links between histone modifications and DNA methylation throughout the genome, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 11 histone modifications and a recently acquired genome-wide nucleotide resolution map of DNA methylation in H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR90) (Lister et al., 2009Lister R. Pelizzola M. Dowen R.H. Hawkins R.D. Hon G.C. Tonti-Filippini J. Nery J.R. Lee L. Ye Z. Ngo Q.M. et al.Human DNA methylomes at base resolution show widespread epigenomic differences.Nature. 2009; 462: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar). We show a large-scale expansion of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 domains in differentiated cells relative to hESCs, which selectively affects genes related to pluripotency, development, and lineage-specific functions. We also find multiple epigenetic mechanisms by which key pluripotent transcription factors are silenced in somatic cells. Finally, our analysis of both cell types reveals context-dependent, complex relationships between chromatin modifications and DNA methylation. We performed ChIP-Seq (Johnson et al., 2007Johnson D.S. Mortazavi A. Myers R.M. Wold B. Genome-wide mapping of in vivo protein-DNA interactions.Science. 2007; 316: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar) experiments to identify global histone modification patterns for H2BK5ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K18ac, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H4K5ac. Antibodies were validated for specificity with peptide dot blot assays and western blotting (Figure S1 available online). ChIP-Seq experiments produced 5 to 40 million monoclonal, uniquely mapped tags per chromatin modification and input DNA for well-correlated biological replicates in H1 hESCs and IMR90 fibroblasts (Figure 1; Table S1). We chose acetylation marks, which are indicative of open chromatin, as well as H3K4 methylation marks featured at active enhancers and promoters (Heintzman et al., 2007Heintzman N.D. Stuart R.K. Hon G. Fu Y. Ching C.W. Hawkins R.D. Barrera L.O. Van Calcar S. Qu C. Ching K.A. et al.Distinct and predictive chromatin signatures of transcriptional promoters and enhancers in the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar, Heintzman et al., 2009Heintzman N.D. Hon G.C. Hawkins R.D. Kheradpour P. Stark A. Harp L.F. Ye Z. Lee L.K. Stuart R.K. Ching C.W. et al.Histone modifications at human enhancers reflect global cell-type-specific gene expression.Nature. 2009; 459: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). We contrasted this architecture with the repressive structures of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 and the genic localization of H3K36me3, a transcription elongation-coupled chromatin mark (Krogan et al., 2003Krogan N.J. Kim M. Tong A. Golshani A. Cagney G. Canadien V. Richards D.P. Beattie B.K. Emili A. Boone C. et al.Methylation of histone H3 by Set2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is linked to transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2002Li J. Moazed D. Gygi S.P. Association of the histone methyltransferase Set2 with RNA polymerase II plays a role in transcription elongation.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49383-49388Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Visualization of these maps indicates that histone modifications show two distinct types of spatial distributions: small, punctuated peaks and large, spreading domains (Figure 1). Modifications such as H3K4 methylation and acetylation are typically found in peak-like structures (Figures 1A and 1B), whereas H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 are usually seen in broad domains of varying widths (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1D). It is possible that these two types of chromatin-modification patterns correspond to distinct physical structures of chromatin fibers in vivo (Figure 1E). Most peak-finding programs rely on the assumption of stranded distributions of tags at peaks, and as such cannot detect the broad domains typical of histone modifications (Kharchenko et al., 2008Kharchenko P.V. Tolstorukov M.Y. Park P.J. Design and analysis of ChIP-seq experiments for DNA-binding proteins.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2008Zhang Y. Liu T. Meyer C.A. Eeckhoute J. Johnson D.S. Bernstein B.E. Nussbaum C. Myers R.M. Brown M. Li W. Liu X.S. Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS).Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (6772) Google Scholar). To systematically enumerate genomic regions enriched for chromatin modifications, we devised a computational method called ChromaBlocks, which is tailored to identify both peak-like structures and large chromatin domains from ChIP-Seq data (see Experimental Procedures). This analysis yielded between 9,414 and 43,536 blocks for each chromatin modification in hESC or IMR90, occupying between 68 million and 510 million base pairs (Table S2). Analysis with permuted data indicates that this method is highly specific (median FDR = 0.97%, Table S2) and approaches saturation around 10 million unique monoclonal reads (Figures S2D–S2G). With this tool in place, we are able to assess varying chromatin structures and compare how the chromatin landscape of hESCs differs from that of differentiated cells. Comparing the domains in hESC and IMR90, we find that the chromatin architecture at a surprisingly large fraction of the genome is different (Figures 2A and 2B ). Many of the H3K9me3 domains in hESCs appear small and interspersed (median length = 6.9 kb) but are expanded significantly in IMR90 cells (median length = 11.4 kb, p < 1E-15) (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D; Tables S3 and S4). Correspondingly, the number of base pairs spanned by H3K9me3 in IMR90 (510 Mb) is 3.4 times larger than in hESCs (148 Mb) (Figure 2C). Similarly, the number of base pairs spanned by H3K27me3 domains in IMR90 (394 Mb) is 3.3 times more than in hESCs (119 Mb) (Tables S5 and S6). The median size of an H3K27me3 domain in IMR90 (16,400 bp) expands to almost twice that of hESCs (8600 bp, p < 1E-308, Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 2C), whereas coverage of H3K36me3 domains remains consistent (hESC median = 15,700 bp; IMR90 median size = 16,900 bp, p = 4.6E-7) (Figures 1A, 2C, and 2D). In total, 50% of the IMR90 genome is spanned by chromatin domains from the 11 marks profiled, whereas only 32% of the hESC genome is in chromatin domains (Figure 2E). The difference is largely accounted for by H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 dispersal (Figures 2D, 2F, and 2G). Each of these marks covers 4% of the hESC genome, but expands to 12% (H3K27me3) and 16% (H3K9me3) in IMR90 cells (Figures 2F and 2G). To confirm whether expansion of repressive domains is a key characteristic of differentiated cell fate, we tested whether expanded domains exist in other cells. We analyzed genome-wide profiles of H3K27me3 in CD4+ T cells (Barski et al., 2007Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K.

Jothi R. Schones D.E. Roh T.Y. Cui K. Zhao K. Global analysis of the insulator binding protein CTCF in chromatin barrier regions reveals demarcation of active and repressive domains.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Indeed, much of the CD4+ T cell genome (324 Mb) is spanned by H3K27me3 domains, nearly three times as large as in hESCs. Because of insufficient read depth for H3K9me3 in this cell type, we did not include H3K9me3 blocks in this analysis. The expansion of H3K27me3 holds true in various differentiated cell types. ChromaBlocks analysis of H3K27me3 shows expansion in nontransformed HUVEC (347 Mb) and NHEK (312 Mb) cells, as well as transformed GM12878 lymphoblasts (286 Mb) and K562 leukemia cells (353 Mb) (Figure S3A; data produced and released from the ENCODE Project [Birney et al., 2007Birney E.

All lineage-committed cell types examined, normal and cancer cell types, have a clear increase in repressive chromatin structure compared to hESCs. In contrast, modifications associated with gene activity including H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K36me3 are not expanded in these differentiated cell lines compared to hESCs (data not shown). We investigated the extent to which genes are silenced in fibroblasts compared to hESCs by broad domains. Despite expansion of H3K27me3 domains, we observed similar numbers of promoters covered by H3K27me3 in hESCs (4736) and IMR90 cells (4279) (Figures S3B and S3C). However, 83% of H3K27me3-marked promoters are H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent promoters in hESCs, compared to 50% in IMR90 cells (Figure 3A ). Of the 2485 promoters commonly marked by H3K27me3 in hESCs and IMR90 cells, 1512 show greater than 50% expansion in IMR90 cells. The median H3K27me3 domain spanning a promoter in hESCs is 10 kb, compared to 28 kb in IMR90 and 22 kb in CD4+ T cells, suggesting that expansion of H3K27me3 domains is a common feature of differentiated cells (Figure S3). Gene ontology (GO) analysis via DAVID (Dennis et al., 2003Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. DAVID: Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of genes marked by H3K27me3 expansion in IMR90 cells reveals significant enrichment in developmental processes (Figure S3D), including genes from the BMP, FGF, FOX, SOX, and GATA families (Table S7). Additionally, GO analysis on the 314 promoters marked by H3K27me3 expansion in hESCs compared to IMR90 cells revealed significant enrichment of a small class of developmental proteins including brain-specific genes such as EMX2 and BAI1, as well as several HOX genes. The bivalent ESC-chromatin state often transitions to H3K27me3 and expands to cover the entire gene locus and frequently neighboring gene loci. An additional 1742 promoters are marked by H3K27me3 only in IMR90 cells but not in hESCs and are enriched for nondevelopmentally related biological processes including immune and defense response (Figure S3D). Interestingly, distinct genes are marked by expanded H3K27me3 domains in IMR90 and CD4+ T cells. There are 2138 promoters marked by H3K27me3 in hESCs that expand in IMR90 or CD4+ cells. Of these, 929 (44%) are IMR90 specific and 626 (29%) exhibit CD4+-specific expansion, whereas 583 (27%) expand in both cells. IMR90-specific expanded domains are enriched for T cell, B cell, and lymphocyte-related genes, whereas CD4+-specific expanded domains are enriched for extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagens. These results suggest that cell fate commitment is also a process of epigenetic gene repression that is unique to different lineages. Similar to H3K27me3, there are 45% more H3K9me3-only marked domains in IMR90 cells (659) than in hESCs (456). However, a smaller fraction of gene promoters are spanned by H3K9me3 domains in hESCs (932, 5%) and IMR90 cells (1448, 8%) (overlap 456 promoters) (Figures 2C, 2F, 2G and 3A). In several instances, gene family clusters are marked by H3K9me3 domains, including olfactory receptors (OR) and the NLRP (Figure 1D), KRTAP, LCE, and zinc finger (ZNF) families. Notably, H3K9me3 spreading covers the gene encoding the early developmental factor DPPA3 in IMR90 cells, and this spreading ends immediately before NANOG. Interestingly, we observe five times as many promoters simultaneously marked by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in IMR90 cells (359) as in hESCs (71) (Figure 3A). For example, the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome gene, GPC3 (Pilia et al., 1996Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A. Baybayan P. Chen E.Y. Huber R. Neri G. Cao A. Forabosco A. Schlessinger D. Mutations in GPC3, a glypican gene, cause the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome.Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), is bivalent (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) and expressed in hESCs, yet is repressed by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in IMR90 cells (Figure 3B). Additionally, we observe key developmental transcription factors associated with both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in IMR90 cells. As examples, POU3F4 and PAX3 are marked by H3K27me3 in hESCs and gain H3K9me3 in IMR90 cells to become dually marked for repression (Figures 3C and 3D). POU class transcription factors establish cell type-specific gene expression and cell fate decisions (Ryan and Rosenfeld, 1997Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. POU domain family values: Flexibility, partnerships, and developmental codes.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and PAX genes are critical for cell fate, organogenesis, and proliferation, leading to an important role in cancer (Loh et al., 2006Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. et al.The Oct4 and Nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). In light of this, we asked whether H3K9me3/H3K27me3-marked promoters in IMR90 cells share similar functions. GO analysis revealed significant enrichment for developmental processes, including multicellular organismal development, system development, and anatomical structure development (Figure 3E), noting that many dual-marked promoters include key developmental regulators (Figure 3F), such as HOX genes. The colocalization of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 at genes was recently noted by others (Bilodeau et al., 2009Bilodeau S. Kagey M.H. Frampton G.M. Rahl P.B. Young R.A. SetDB1 contributes to repression of genes encoding developmental regulators and maintenance of ES cell state.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Not all H3K27me3-marked sites are associated with H3K9me3. This dual repression at specialized regulators may point to the importance of maintaining their silencing in differentiated cells. These genes serve as likely candidates for cell fate decisions. With distinct spatial modes of H3K9me3- and H3K27me3-marking genes, we asked how these modes affect gene repression. We considered four cases: (1) promoters not marked in hESCs but marked in IMR90 cells (appear), (2) promoters covered by blocks in hESCs but expanded by at least 50% in IMR90 cells (expand), (3) promoters unmarked in both cells (unmarked), and (4) promoters marked by similarly sized blocks in both cells (marked). Table S7 shows the H3K4-, K9-, and K27-me3 states for all genes and expression changes. The acquisition of H3K9me3 at promoters showed the most significant decrease in gene expression (p = 0.011) compared to the other H3K9me3 scenarios (Figures 4A, 4C, and 4D ). In contrast, the greatest repression for H3K27me3 cases occurred upon domain expansion (Figures 4B, 4E, and 4F). This may imply that the presence of H3K9me3 alone is enough to suppress gene expression and expansion of domains has a smaller effect on gene repression. By contrast, the presence of narrowly marked H3K27me3 promoters is frequently insufficient to silence a gene (Figure 4F), as they are often in a bivalent state, but the expansion seems to maintain stable silencing of gene expression in the differentiated cells (p = 1.3E-19). DNA methylation is a critical component of the epigenome that represses gene expression through promoter CG methylation, in addition to being localized at heterochromatin and repetitive elements in the genome. This mark is thought to maintain long-term repression and to be less dynamic than histone modifications. There is also evidence that some crosstalk between these epigenetic mechanisms exists, suggesting a direct link between H3K9 methyltransferases (HKMT) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (Fuks et al., 2003Fuks F.

https://openalex.org/W2087804239,"Peroxisomes have long been established to play a central role in regulating various metabolic activities in mammalian cells. These organelles act in concert with mitochondria to control the metabolism of lipids and reactive oxygen species. However, while mitochondria have emerged as an important site of antiviral signal transduction, a role for peroxisomes in immune defense is unknown. Here, we report that the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) adaptor protein MAVS is located on peroxisomes and mitochondria. We find that peroxisomal and mitochondrial MAVS act sequentially to create an antiviral cellular state. Upon viral infection, peroxisomal MAVS induces the rapid interferon-independent expression of defense factors that provide short-term protection, whereas mitochondrial MAVS activates an interferon-dependent signaling pathway with delayed kinetics, which amplifies and stabilizes the antiviral response. The interferon regulatory factor IRF1 plays a crucial role in regulating MAVS-dependent signaling from peroxisomes. These results establish that peroxisomes are an important site of antiviral signal transduction."

To identify common breast cancer susceptibility alleles, we conducted a genome-wide association study in which 582,886 SNPs were genotyped in 3,659 cases with a family history of the disease and 4,897 controls. Promising associations were evaluated in a second stage, comprising 12,576 cases and 12,223 controls. We identified five new susceptibility loci, on chromosomes 9, 10 and 11 (P = 4.6 x 10(-7) to P = 3.2 x 10(-15)). We also identified SNPs in the 6q25.1 (rs3757318, P = 2.9 x 10(-6)), 8q24 (rs1562430, P = 5.8 x 10(-7)) and LSP1 (rs909116, P = 7.3 x 10(-7)) regions that showed more significant association with risk than those reported previously.

https://openalex.org/W2088906043,"New neurons are generated in the adult hippocampus throughout life by neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs), and neurogenesis is a plastic process responsive to external stimuli. We show that canonical Notch signaling through RBP-J is required for hippocampal neurogenesis. Notch signaling distinguishes morphologically distinct Sox2+ NSCs, and within these pools subpopulations can shuttle between mitotically active or quiescent. Radial and horizontal NSCs respond selectively to neurogenic stimuli. Physical exercise activates the quiescent radial population whereas epileptic seizures induce expansion of the horizontal NSC pool. Surprisingly, reduced neurogenesis correlates with a loss of active horizontal NSCs in aged mice rather than a total loss of stem cells, and the transition to a quiescent state is reversible to rejuvenate neurogenesis in the brain. The discovery of multiple NSC populations with Notch dependence but selective responses to stimuli and reversible quiescence has important implications for the mechanisms of adaptive learning and also for regenerative therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2004471993,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells suggested to be critical for tumor maintenance, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Prospective identification and targeting of CSCs are therefore priorities for the development of novel therapeutic paradigms. Although CSC enrichment has been achieved with cell surface proteins including CD133 (Prominin-1), the roles of current CSC markers in tumor maintenance remain unclear. We examined the glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) perivascular microenvironment in patient specimens to identify enrichment markers with a functional significance and identified integrin alpha6 as a candidate. Integrin alpha6 is coexpressed with conventional GSC markers and enriches for GSCs. Targeting integrin alpha6 in GSCs inhibits self-renewal, proliferation, and tumor formation capacity. Our results provide evidence that GSCs express high levels of integrin alpha6, which can serve not only as an enrichment marker but also as a promising antiglioblastoma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2060245619,"During the transition from the inner cell mass (ICM) cells of blastocysts to pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro, a normal developmental program is replaced in cells that acquire a capacity for infinite self-renewal and pluripotency. We explored the underlying mechanism of this switch by using RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis at the resolution of single cells. We detected significant molecular transitions and major changes in transcript variants, which include genes for general metabolism. Furthermore, the expression of repressive epigenetic regulators increased with a concomitant decrease in gene activators that might be necessary to sustain the inherent plasticity of ESCs. Furthermore, we detected changes in microRNAs (miRNAs), with one set that targets early differentiation genes while another set targets pluripotency genes to maintain the unique ESC epigenotype. Such genetic and epigenetic events may contribute to a switch from a normal developmental program in adult cells during the formation of diseased tissues, including cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2084264548,"In embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines generated from human embryos determined through preimplantation genetic diagnosis to carry the fragile X mutation, the FMR1 gene is expressed in undifferentiated cells but undergoes transcriptional silencing after ESC differentiation (Eiges et al., 2007Eiges R. Urbach A. Malcov M. Frumkin T. Schwartz T. Amit A. Yaron Y. Eden A. Yanuka O. Benvenisty N. Ben-Yosef D.

Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from fibroblasts of individuals carrying the fragile X mutation. Despite successful reprogramming of the somatic cells to pluripotency, the FMR1 gene remained inactive and carried DNA methylation and histone modifications indicative of inactive heterochromatin. These data highlight critical differences between ESCs and iPSCs in modeling fragile X disorder. Pluripotent stem cells are potentially an important tool to model human genetic disorders. Human embryonic stem cells can recapitulate early stages of human development, and they can also differentiate into cells from the three embryonic germ layers (Schuldiner et al., 2000Schuldiner M.

Thus, human pluripotent stem cells can be used to analyze the effect of specific mutations on the differentiation of various cell types and on early developmental processes that are otherwise inaccessible for research. In the past few years, several diseases have been modeled in pluripotent stem cells, either by direct gene mutagenesis or by deriving ESCs from embryos determined by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to carry genetic mutation (Eiges et al., 2007Eiges R.

By reprogramming somatic cells from patients, one may isolate pluripotent cells that harbor disease-specific mutations (Park et al., 2008aPark I.H. Arora N. Huo H. Maherali N. Ahfeldt T. Shimamura A. Lensch M.W. Cowan C. Hochedlinger K. Daley G.Q. Cell. 2008; 134: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). The reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent cells raised the question whether iPSCs will be able to replace human ESCs in basic research as well as in clinical applications (Belmonte et al., 2009Belmonte J.C. Ellis J. Hochedlinger K. Yamanaka S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We are now in a unique position to compare disease phenotypes manifest in ESCs to those seen in iPSCs. Fragile X (FX) syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation (Crawford et al., 2001Crawford D.C. Acuña J.M. Sherman S.L. Genet.

Mutat. 1992; 1: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is caused by the absence of expression of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene (O'Donnell and Warren, 2002O'Donnell W.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 315-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The vast majority of FX patients do not express FMR1 resulting from CGG triplet repeat expansion in the 5′ untranslated region of the gene (Pearson et al., 2005Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, Verkerk et al., 1991Verkerk A.J. Pieretti M. Sutcliffe J.S. Fu Y.H. Kuhl D.P. Pizzuti A. Reiner O. Richards S. Victoria M.F. Zhang F.P. et al.Cell. 1991; 65: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Full expansion of the CGG repeat usually coincides with hypermethylation of the repeat region and its upstream promoter (Oberle et al., 1991Oberle I. Rousseau F. Heitz D. Kretz C. Devys D. Hanauer A. Boue J. Bertheas M. Mandel J. Science. 1991; 252: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), and with chromatin modifications such as histone H3 tail deacetylation, histone H3K9 methylation, and histone H3K4 demethylation (Coffee et al., 1999Coffee B. Zhang F. Warren S.T. Reines D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Until recently, early events in FMR1 silencing could not be characterized because of the lack of an appropriate animal model (Bontekoe et al., 1997Bontekoe C.J. de Graaff E. Nieuwenhuizen I.M. Willemsen R. Oostra B.A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 293-298PubMed Google Scholar, Lavedan et al., 1997Lavedan C.N. Garrett L. Nussbaum R.L. Hum.

Urbach A. Malcov M. Frumkin T. Schwartz T. Amit A. Yaron Y. Eden A. Yanuka O. Benvenisty N. Ben-Yosef D. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 568-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In the undifferentiated FX-ESCs, the full expansion of the CGG triplet repeat is not sufficient to inactivate the expression of the FMR1 gene and gene silencing occurs only upon differentiation (Eiges et al., 2007Eiges R. Urbach A. Malcov M. Frumkin T. Schwartz T. Amit A. Yaron Y. Eden A. Yanuka O. Benvenisty N. Ben-Yosef D.

Evidence from chorionic villus samples supports a similar conclusion that transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene occurs with human development (Sutcliffe et al., 1992Sutcliffe J.S. Nelson D.L.

Current data suggest that upon cell differentiation, the mutated FMR1 gene recruits specific histone modifications followed by DNA methylation, which silence its transcription (Eiges et al., 2007Eiges R. Urbach A. Malcov M. Frumkin T. Schwartz T. Amit A. Yaron Y. Eden A. Yanuka O. Benvenisty N. Ben-Yosef D.

In the current study we have isolated iPSC lines from three FX affected males and compared the regulation of FMR1 transcription to that of human FX-ESCs. Fibroblasts from 4-year-old and 28-year-old individuals, as well as fetal-lung fibroblasts from a 22-week-old affected fetus with FX syndrome, were reprogrammed in culture according to published protocols (Park et al., 2008bPark I.H. Lerou P.H. Zhao R. Huo H. Daley G.Q. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14962) Google Scholar). The efficiency of reprogramming of the FX-fibroblasts was similar to that of the WT-fibroblasts (0.0056% and 0.0024%, respectively), as determined by counting the number of Tra-1-60-positive colonies. Multiple FX-iPSC clones were analyzed (seven from the first, two from the second, and two from the third patient). The iPSC clones demonstrated typical characteristics of pluripotent stem cells: morphology similar to that of ESCs and expression of alkaline phosphatase, Tra-1-60, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SSEA3, SSEA4, and Tra-1-81 (Figure S1A available online); silencing of retroviral transgenes (Figure S1B and data not shown); reactivation of genes indicative of pluripotency (Figures S1C and S1D and data not shown); and maintenance of a normal diploid karyotype (Figure S1E). By hierarchical clustering and scatter plot analysis of DNA microarray results, we observed that the iPSCs cluster together with human ESCs and apart from their cell of origin (Figures S2A and S2B). The cells generated embryoid bodies (Figure S2C, I) that expressed markers of endoderm (Figure S2C, II and III), mesoderm (Figure S2C, IV and V), and ectoderm (Figure S2C, VI) as demonstrated by immunostaining and also by RT-PCR (data not shown). The iPSC lines also differentiated in vivo into teratomas that manifest elements of all embryonic germ layers (Figure S2D). Thus, these human iPSC lines met stringent criteria for pluripotency (Chan et al., 2009Chan E.M. Ratanasirintrawoot S. Park I.H. Manos P.D. Loh Y.H. Huo H. Miller J.D. Hartung O. Rho J. Ince T.A. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, Daley et al., 2009Daley G.Q. Lensch M.W. Jaenisch R. Meissner A. Plath K. Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4 (author reply 202): 200-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The FMR1 gene is expressed in FX-ESCs, WT-ESCs, wild-type skin fibroblasts, and iPSCs derived from them (Figure 1A ). The FMR1 gene is also expressed in wild-type lung fibroblasts (MRC5) and iPSCs derived from them (data not shown). In marked contrast to all of these cells, the FMR1 gene remained transcriptionally silent in all FX-iPSC clones derived from skin or lung FX-fibroblasts (Figure 1A). These results suggest that the differences in the expression of FMR1 between the WT and FX-iPSCs are due to the FMR1 mutation and not due to the tissue source of the original fibroblasts. The absence of FMR1 gene expression in the FX-iPSCs was observed both in early passage (P5) and at higher passages (up to P18; Figure 1B), indicating a stable phenotype. The FX-iPSCs also lacked expression of the FMR1 protein by immunostaining (Figure 1C). Downregulation of the FMR1 gene occurs upon differentiation of human FX-ESCs, concomitant with downregulation of pluripotency-associated genes such as NANOG (Figure 1D; Eiges et al., 2007Eiges R. Urbach A. Malcov M. Frumkin T. Schwartz T. Amit A. Yaron Y. Eden A. Yanuka O. Benvenisty N. Ben-Yosef D. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 568-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when differentiated cells derived from FX-ESCs were reverted to pluripotency by introduction of the reprogramming factors OCT4/SOX2/c-MYC/KLF4, they also failed to reactive FMR1 expression (Figure 1D). The CGG repeat length in the iPSCs derived from the differentiated FX-ESCs is in the same range as the FX-ESCs and the two subclones of FX-ESCs (Figure 1E). The data suggest that the silencing of the FMR1 in the FX-iPSCs is not due to expansion of the CGG repeats above that observed in FX-ESCs, where the gene is still active. The data also indicate that the reprogramming process has no major effect on the instability of the CGG repeats, because the reprogrammed cells have a similar number of repeats as their parental fibroblast (Figure S2E). To examine the molecular basis for the silencing of FMR1 transcription in FX-iPSCs, we analyzed DNA methylation level at the FMR1 promoter by using bisulfite treatment followed by pyrosequencing in fibroblasts and in their derived iPSC lines. Pyrosequencing is an accurate and reliable method to determine the degree of methylation at several CpGs in close proximity with high quantitative resolution (Brakensiek et al., 2007Brakensiek K.

While the FMR1 locus consistently lacked methylation in normal fibroblasts and their derivative iPSC lines, 8 of 9 FX-iPSC clones analyzed were highly methylated at levels comparable to the original fibroblasts; one iPSC clone (FX-iPS A-52) showed an intermediate methylation level, but still much higher than the WT- fibroblasts and iPSCs (Figure 2A ). DNA methylation at the FMR1 locus persisted in the FX-iPSC clones despite the complete lack of methylation at the promoters for OCT4 (Figures 2B and 2C) and NANOG (not shown). The FX-iPSC clones thus show a persistence of DNA methylation at the FMR1 locus even after reprogramming. We further explored histone modifications associated with transcriptionally active (H3 tail acetylation and lysine 4 methylation) and repressed (lysine 9 methylation) chromatin states associated with FMR1 silencing in somatic cells of FX individuals (Coffee et al., 1999Coffee B.

We carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to analyze these modifications in two different FX-iPSC lines (#52 and #89). In contrast to the active chromatin marks on the FMR1 locus in FX-ESCs, normal ESCs, and normal iPSCs, the FMR1 locus in the FX-iPSCs is methylated at H3K9 and lacks histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation (Figure 2D). Our data suggest that in FX-iPSCs, the mutated FMR1 gene has chromatin modifications that are consistent with its transcriptionally silent state (see Figure S2F). Our results thus imply that the mutant FMR1 locus in FX-iPSC lines is resistant to activation by the iPSC reprogramming protocol. Although reversion of aberrant methylation, heterochromatin formation, and loss of FMR1 expression has not been studied during passage of the mutant allele through the germline in FRAXA families, conflicting data have been reported for the capacity to reactivate the silenced FMR1 gene in vitro. Two groups have shown that transfer of the X chromosome from FX patient cells into mouse embryonal carcinoma cells (Wöhrle et al., 2001Wöhrle D. Salat U. Hameister H. Vogel W. Steinbach P. Am. J.

Popovich B.W. Jacky P.B. Turker M.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2293-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, de novo methylation of an unmethylated mutant FMR1 gene did not occur when inserted via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer into a mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line (Burman et al., 1999bBurman R.W.

Treatment of somatic FX-fibroblasts with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine has been shown to reactivate FMR1 expression (Tabolacci et al., 2005Tabolacci E. Pietrobono R. Moscato U. Oostra B.A. Chiurazzi P. Neri G. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Apparently, under some circumstances the epigenetic marks that maintain silencing of a mutant FMR1 gene can be erased; however, the exact conditions that enable the reactivation of the FMR1 gene remain unclear. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that reprogramming cells from a different tissue or by a different method might reactivate FMR1 gene expression over time in FX-iPSCs, the FMR1 locus seems to be highly resistant to the reprogramming process, according to current standard practice.

Our data highlight a significant difference between FX-ESCs and FX-iPSCs with regard to their expression of the FMR1 gene. The mutated FMR1 gene is expressed in FX-ESCs and transcriptionally silenced upon differentiation, whereas in FX-iPSCs the FMR1 locus remains inactive and is not reset by the reprogramming process to the transcriptionally active state. It is thus possible that other disorders related to epigenetic defects, including triplet repeat and imprinting disorders, may likewise evade the reprogramming process. Although FX-iPSCs do not model the differentiation-dependent silencing of the FMR1 gene, as shown for FX-ESCs, they may remain valuable for analyzing the role of FMR1 in neural cells. In FX-iPSCs, like in FX-neurons and in contrast to normal human iPSCs, the FMR1 gene is methylated, its chromatin is in a closed conformation, and the gene is not expressed. Therefore, differentiation of FX-iPSCs into neurons may nonetheless facilitate the study of FMR1 in neural cells. Until a deeper understanding of the potential differences between iPSCs and ESCs is delineated, the study of both iPSCs from patients and human ESCs carrying the same mutation (either from PGD embryos or by genetic manipulation) might, whenever possible, be the optimal approach to model human genetic disorders through cell culture. Finally, the distinction between FX-ESCs and FX-iPSCs at the FMR1 locus might be a particular example of a more general phenomenon of epigenetic differences between human ESCs and iPSCs, which highlights the need for more studies to clarify the similarity and differences between ESCs and iPSCs.

We have previously demonstrated that MBD1 deficiency impairs adult neural stem/progenitor cell (aNSC) differentiation and neurogenesis, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Here, we show that MBD1 regulates the expression of several microRNAs in aNSCs and, specifically, that miR-184 is directly repressed by MBD1. High levels of miR-184 promoted proliferation but inhibited differentiation of aNSCs, whereas inhibition of miR-184 rescued the phenotypes associated with MBD1 deficiency. We further found that miR-184 regulates the expression of Numblike (Numbl), a known regulator of brain development, by binding to the 3'-UTR of Numbl mRNA and affecting its translation. Expression of exogenous Numbl could rescue the aNSC defects that result from either miR-184 overexpression or MBD1 deficiency. Therefore, MBD1, miR-184, and Numbl form a regulatory network that helps control the balance between proliferation and differentiation of aNSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2080574942,"The PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) clamp encircles DNA and thus tethers polymerases to DNA during replication. Ubiquitination of PCNA after DNA damage, which is mediated by proteins of the Rad6 pathway of post-replicative repair (PRR), facilitates DNA damage bypass by dictating which polymerase is recruited to the fork. When this occurs has been a topic of much debate. Daigaku et al. now show that PRR can be postponed until much of the undamaged genome is replicated. The experimental system also allows them to conclude that PRR of DNA lesions occurs mainly by an error-prone process, with error-free bypass playing a minor role. Post-replicative repair (PRR) enables cells to bypass or overcome DNA damage during DNA replication. In eukaryotes, ubiquitylation of the replication clamp PCNA by components of the RAD6 pathway activates damage bypass. When this occurs has been debated. It is now shown that PRR can be postponed until much of the undamaged genome is replicated. Moreover, it seems that PRR occurs mainly by an error-prone process, with error-free bypass playing a minor role. Post-replication repair (PRR) is a pathway that allows cells to bypass or overcome lesions during DNA replication1. In eukaryotes, damage bypass is activated by ubiquitylation of the replication clamp PCNA through components of the RAD6 pathway2. Whereas monoubiquitylation of PCNA allows mutagenic translesion synthesis by damage-tolerant DNA polymerases3,4,5, polyubiquitylation is required for an error-free pathway that probably involves a template switch to the undamaged sister chromatid6. Both the timing of PRR events during the cell cycle and their location relative to replication forks, as well as the factors required downstream of PCNA ubiquitylation, have remained poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that the RAD6 pathway normally operates during S phase. However, using an inducible system of DNA damage bypass in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), we show that the process is separable in time and space from genome replication, thus allowing direct visualization and quantification of productive PRR tracts. We found that both during and after S phase ultraviolet-radiation-induced lesions are bypassed predominantly via translesion synthesis, whereas the error-free pathway functions as a backup system. Our approach has revealed the distribution of PRR tracts in a synchronized cell population. It will allow an in-depth mechanistic analysis of how cells manage the processing of lesions to their genomes during and after replication."
https://openalex.org/W2136886131,"P2X7 is the largest member of the P2X subfamily of purinergic receptors. A typical feature is the carboxyl tail, which allows formation of a large pore. Recently a naturally occurring truncated P2X7 splice variant, isoform B (P2X7B), has been identified. Here we show that P2X7B expression in HEK293 cells, a cell type lacking endogenous P2X receptors, mediated ATP-stimulated channel activity but not plasma membrane permeabilization, raised endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content, activated the transcription factor NFATc1, increased the cellular ATP content, and stimulated growth. In addition, P2X7B-transfected HEK293 cells (HEK293-P2X7B), like most tumor cells, showed strong soft agarinfiltrating ability. When coexpressed with full-length P2X7 (P2X7A), P2X7B coassembled with P2X7A into a heterotrimer and potentiated all known responses mediated by this latter receptor. P2X7B mRNA was found to be widely distributed in human tissues, especially in the immune and nervous systems, and to a much higher level than P2X7A. Finally, P2X7B expression was increased on mitogenic stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocyte. Altogether, these data show that P2X7B is widely expressed in several human tissues, modulates P2X7A functions, participates in the control of cell growth, and may help understand the role of the P2X7 receptor in the control of normal and cancer cell proliferation.—Adinolfi, E., Cirillo, M., Woltersdorf, R., Falzoni, S., Chiozzi, P., Pellegatti, P., Callegari, M.

https://openalex.org/W2060252363,"Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized from choline via the CDP-choline pathway. Liver cells can also synthesize PC via the sequential methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine, catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). The current study investigates whether or not hepatic PC biosynthesis is linked to diet-induced obesity. Pemt(+/+) mice fed a high fat diet for 10 weeks increased in body mass by 60% and displayed insulin resistance, whereas Pemt(-/-) mice did not. Compared with Pemt(+/+) mice, Pemt(-/-) mice had increased energy expenditure and maintained normal peripheral insulin sensitivity; however, they developed hepatomegaly and steatosis. In contrast, mice with impaired biosynthesis of PC via the CDP-choline pathway in liver became obese when fed a high fat diet. We, therefore, hypothesized that insufficient choline, rather than decreased hepatic phosphatidylcholine, was responsible for the lack of weight gain in Pemt(-/-) mice despite the presence of 1.3 g of choline/kg high fat diet. Supplementation with an additional 2.7 g of choline (but not betaine)/kg of diet normalized energy metabolism, weight gain, and insulin resistance in high fat diet-fed Pemt(-/-) mice. Furthermore, Pemt(+/+) mice that were fed a choline-deficient diet had increased oxygen consumption, had improved glucose tolerance, and gained less weight. Thus, de novo synthesis of choline via PEMT has a previously unappreciated role in regulating whole body energy metabolism."

To elucidate the structural and biological effects of the mutations, we began by examining monomer conformational dynamics and oligomerization. Relative to their wild type homologues, and in both the Aβ40 and Aβ42 systems, the English and Tottori substitutions accelerated the kinetics of secondary structure change from statistical coil → α/β → β and produced oligomer size distributions skewed to higher order. This skewing was reflected in increases in average oligomer size, as measured using electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Stabilization of peptide oligomers using in situ chemical cross-linking allowed detailed study of their properties. Each substitution produced an oligomer that displayed substantial β-strand (H6R) or α/β (D7N) structure, in contrast to the predominately statistical coil structure of wild type Aβ oligomers. Mutant oligomers functioned as fibril seeds, and with efficiencies significantly higher than those of their wild type homologues.

Shankar G.M. Mehta T. Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Physiol. 2006; 572: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) found that Aβ trimers fully inhibit long term potentiation, whereas dimers and tetramers have an intermediate potency. Dimers and trimers from the conditioned medium of APP-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells have been found to cause progressive loss of synapses in organotypic rat hippocampal slices (24.Shankar G.M. Bloodgood B.L. Townsend M. Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Sabatini B.L. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2866-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Aβ oligomers extracted from AD brains disrupt synapse structure and function (25.Shankar G.M. Li S. Mehta T.H. Garcia-Munoz A. Shepardson N.E. Smith I. Brett F.M. Farrell M.A. Rowan M.J. Lemere C.A. Regan C.M. Walsh D.M. Sabatini B.L. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar). Dimers were the smallest active agents in this latter study. Most recently, formal structure-cytotoxicity studies of pure Aβ40 oligomer populations produced the first determinations of oligomer specific activity (26.Ono K. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14745-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Dimers, trimers, and tetramers all were significantly more toxic than monomers. Importantly, a non-linear dependence of cytotoxicity on oligomer order was observed. Oligomers of higher order were disproportionately more toxic (tetramers ≫ trimers ≫ dimers ≫ monomers). These relationships also were observed in assays of fibril nucleation activity (26.Ono K. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14745-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to elucidate the effects of the English and Tottori mutations on Aβ monomer conformation, oligomerization, oligomer structure, fibril nucleation activity, and cytotoxicity. Our results show that the English and Tottori mutations produce Aβ peptides displaying accelerated statistical coil → α/β → β secondary structure transitions and an increased propensity to form relatively large oligomers. These oligomers are more structured than those of wild type Aβ, are more efficient nucleators of fibril formation, and are significantly more cytotoxic. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher Scientific and were of the highest purity available. Water was produced using a Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides, and analogues containing the H6R or D7N amino acid substitutions, were synthesized, purified, and characterized essentially as described (27.Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthesis was performed on an automated peptide synthesizer (model 433A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based methods on pre-loaded Wang resins. Peptides were purified using reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. Quantitative amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry yielded the expected compositions and molecular weights, respectively, for each peptide. Purified peptides were stored as lyophilizates at −20 °C. To prepare peptides for study, Aβ peptide lyophilizates were dissolved at a nominal concentration of 25 μm in 10% (v/v) 60 mm NaOH and 90% (v/v) 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After sonication for 1 min in a bath sonicator (model 1510R-DTH, Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT), the peptide solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Cross-linking of Aβ was performed essentially as described (28.Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 29.Bitan G. Teplow D.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, for Aβ40, the general method was to mix 18 μl of peptide, at a nominal concentration of 25 μm, with 1 μl of 20 mm tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate (Ru(bpy)) and 1 μl of 1 mm ammonium persulfate, both dissolved in 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4. For Aβ42 cross-linking, Ru(bpy) and ammonium persulfate were used at concentrations of 40 and 2 mm, respectively. For some experiments in which higher concentrations of peptides were needed, the molar ratios of Ru(bpy) and ammonium persulfate were adjusted proportionately to the Aβ concentration so that the stoichiometry remained constant. The mixtures then were irradiated for 1 s with visible light and the reaction was quenched with 1 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol (Fisher Scientific) in water. To determine the oligomer size frequency distribution, 18 μl of each cross-linked sample was electrophoresed on a 1.0-mm thick, 10–20% Tris-Tricine gradient gel (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, the gels were visualized by silver staining (SilverXpress, Invitrogen). Densitometry was then performed and One-Dscan software (version 2.2.2; BD Biosciences) was used to determine peak areas of baseline-corrected data. Un-cross-linked samples were used as controls in each experiment. PICUP reagents were removed from cross-linked samples by size exclusion chromatography. To do so, 1.5-cm diameter cylindrical columns were packed manually with 2 g of Bio-Gel P2 Fine (Bio-Rad), which produced a 6-ml column volume. The column was first washed twice with 25 ml of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5. Two-hundred sixteen μl of 50–100 μm cross-linked sample was then loaded. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of ≈0.15 ml/min. The first 1 ml of eluate was collected. The fractionation range of the Bio-Gel P2 column is 100–1800 Da. Aβ peptides thus eluted in the void volume, whereas Ru(bpy) (Mr = 748.6), ammonium persulfate (Mr = 228.2), and dithiothreitol (Mr = 154.2) enter the column matrix and are separated from Aβ. Experiments on Aβ40 and Aβ42 confirmed that the 1-ml void volume fraction contained Aβ oligomers (supplemental Fig. S1). This was shown by examining 18-μl aliquots of the void volume fraction and the subsequent 1-ml fraction using SDS-PAGE and silver staining on 1.0-mm thick, 10–20% Tris-Tricine gradient gels (Invitrogen). Fractions were lyophilized immediately after collection. Reconstitution of the lyophilizates to a nominal concentration of 50 μm in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, followed by a repetition of the SDS-PAGE analysis, showed that reagent removal, lyophilization, and reconstitution did not alter the oligomer composition of any of the peptide populations under study (supplemental Fig. S2). In cytotoxicity experiments, which require relatively long incubation times, it is important to determine whether peptide assembly occurs. Such assembly would complicate the determination of structure-activity correlations. For this reason, we evaluated the assembly state of each oligomer population by incubating the oligomers in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C and monitoring fluorescence intensity periodically using ThT. All the peptides, except un-cross-linked Aβ40 and Aβ42, displayed low initial fluorescence intensities that did not change significantly during 2 days of incubation (supplemental Fig. S3). In contrast, the un-cross-linked peptides each exhibited large time-dependent increases in fluorescence intensity (supplemental Fig. S3) that indicated fibril-assembly dependent β-sheet formation (30.LeVine 3rd, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The cross-linked peptides thus were stable, as defined by a lack of de novo β-sheet formation. To address the stability question in the opposite manner, namely whether cross-linked oligomers dissociate over time, we incubated the oligomers in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 2 days and then analyzed the oligomer distributions by SDS-PAGE, silver staining, and densitometry (supplemental Fig. S4). Immediately after preparation, oligomers comprised ≈84–86% of the species present in each Aβ40 population (Aβ40, 83.5%; H6R, 85.4%; D7N, 84.7%). This range was identical when determined after 2 days of incubation (Aβ40, 84.0%; H6R, 86.4%; D7N, 85.0%). For Aβ42, oligomers comprised ≈72–77% (Aβ42, 71.6%; H6R, 76.6%; D7N, 76.9%) of the populations prior to incubation. Following incubation, this range was 73–77% (Aβ42, 72.8%; H6R, 75.0%; D7N, 77.3%). These data show, within experimental error, that insignificant oligomer dissociation occurs over a 2-day period with any of the six peptides. CD measurements were made by placing 200 μl of sample into a 1-mm path-length CD cuvette (Hellma, Forest Hills, NY) and acquiring spectra using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The CD cuvettes were maintained on ice prior to introduction into the spectrometer. Following temperature equilibration (≈20 min), spectra were recorded at 22 °C from ≈190 to 260 nm at 0.2-nm resolution with a scan rate of 100 nm/min. Ten scans were acquired and averaged for each sample. Raw data were manipulated by smoothing and subtraction of buffer spectra according to the manufacturer's instructions. The half-time (t½) for the assembly dependent conformational change was determined numerically from the formula: ([θ]t − [θ]min)/([θ]max − [θ]min) = 1/2, where molar ellipticity [θ] always is measured at 198 nm, [θ]t is molar ellipticity at time t, [θ]max is maximal ellipticity, and [θ]min is minimum ellipticity. Aβ peptides were dissolved in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, to produce final concentrations of 25 μm. After sonication for 1 min using a bath sonicator, the peptide solutions were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Cross-linked Aβ40, Aβ42, of their H6R and D7N analogues, were also prepared at a concentration of 25 μm in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4. The cross-linked peptides then were added to the un-cross-linked peptides at a 10% (v/v) ratio. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 0–6 days without agitation. Ten μl of each peptide sample was added to 190 μl of 20 μm ThT dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and then the mixture was vortexed briefly. Fluorescence was determined using an Hitachi F-4500 fluorometer. Excitation and emission wavelength/slit width were 450/5 and 482/10 nm, respectively. The fluorescence intensity was measured three times in succession at time intervals of 10 s and then the three readings were averaged and the average intensity of a ThT blank was subtracted. A 10-μl aliquot of each sample was spotted onto glow-discharged, carbon-coated Formvar grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and incubated for 20 min. The droplet then was displaced with an equal volume of 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in water and incubated for an additional 5 min. Finally, the peptide was stained with 8 μl of 1% (v/v) filtered (0.2 μm) uranyl acetate in water (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). This solution was wicked off and then the grid was air-dried. Samples were examined using a JEOL CX100 transmission electron microscopy. To determine the distribution of assembly sizes, each electron micrograph was divided into quarters. Two horizontal lines were drawn within each quarter so that each quarter was trisected. The diameters of globular or thread-like structures touching each of these lines were then measured using a ×10 magnifier eyepiece containing a graticule (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Peptide solutions were characterized using a Nanoscope V Dimension 5000 scanning probe microscope (Veeco Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). All measurements were carried out in the tapping mode under ambient conditions using single-beam silicon cantilever probes. A 10-μl aliquot of each lyophilized peptide, reconstituted to a concentration of 25 μm in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, was spotted onto freshly cleaved mica (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA), incubated at room temperature for 5 min, rinsed with water, and then blown dry with air. The sample then was examined and the distribution of assembly sizes was determined as described under “Elecron microscopy (EM)”. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks (number 430641, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 in air. The medium was F-12K (ATCC) containing 15% (v/v) horse serum, 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml of amphotericin B. To prepare cells for assay, the medium was removed and the cells were gently washed once with F-12K medium, containing 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml of amphotericin B. A cell suspension then was prepared by addition of this latter medium, containing 100 μg/ml of nerve growth factor (Invitrogen), to the flasks, followed by agitation. Cell concentration was determined using trypan blue staining, after which cells were plated at a density of 30,000 cells/well (90 μl total volume/well) in 96-well assay plates (Costar number 3610, Corning Inc.). The nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of the cells was allowed to proceed for 48 h, at which time toxicity assays were done. Peptide samples were prepared at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 500 μm, in F-12K medium containing 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml of amphotericin B. Aliquots of 10 μl were added to differentiated PC12 cells to yield final Aβ concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 μm. The cells then were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% (v/v) CO2 incubator. Fifteen μl of Dye Solution (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well of the microtiter plate and then the plate was incubated for an additional 3.5 h. The cells then were lysed by the addition of 100 μl of solubilization solution (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by overnight incubation. MTT signal was determined by measuring absorption at 570 nm (corrected for background absorbance at 630 nm) using a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Six replicates were done for each treatment group and the data from three independent experiments were combined and reported as mean ± S.E. Percent toxicity was determined according to the formula: T = ((AAβ − Amedium/(Astaurosporine − Amedium)) × 100, where AAβ, Amedium, and Astaurosporine were absorbance values from Aβ-containing samples, medium alone, or staurosporine alone, respectively. Effective concentration (EC50) was defined as the concentration of each Aβ assembly that produced T = 50%. EC50 was calculated by sigmoidal curve fitting, using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.0a, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). LDH activity was determined using the CytoTox-ONE Homogeneous Membrane Integrity assay (Promega, Madison, WI). To do so, peptide solutions of 25 μm concentration were prepared as described for MTT assays and then incubated with nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells for 48 h. One-hundred μl of LDH reagent was then added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temperature on the benchtop in the dark without agitation for 10 min, after which 50 μl of Stop Solution was added and the fluorescence was measured using a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader set to an excitation wavelength of 560 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Six replicates were done for each treatment group and the data from three independent experiments were combined and reported as mean ± S.E. Percent toxicity was calculated according to the formula used in the MTT assays, except that the term Astaurosporine was replaced with Alysis. One-way factorial analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were used to determine statistical significance among data sets. For calculation of significance among oligomer/monomer ratios (Fig. 3), paired t tests were done. These tests were implemented within GraphPad Prism software (version 4.0a, GraphPad Software, Inc.). Significance was defined as p < 0.05. To determine and compare the secondary structure dynamics of wild type Aβ isoforms and N-terminal mutants 3We refer to the English (H6R) and Tottori (D7N) peptides as “mutants” only for ease in distinguishing them from wild type Aβ40 and Aβ42. This designation does not refer directly to the corresponding DNA sequences. thereof, we used CD to monitor peptide folding and assembly systems during 6 days of incubation at 37 °C. All six peptides initially produced spectra consistent with primarily statistical coil (SC) secondary structure (Fig. 1, A–F). The major feature of these spectra was a large magnitude minimum centered at ≈198 nm. To allow comparisons of the kinetics among the six peptides, the half-time (t½) for the entire transition process was determined using [θ]198, which correlates with SC, as a metric (see “Experimental Procedures”). Aβ40 displayed substantial secondary structure changes between days 3 and 5 that were consistent with previously reported SC → α/β → β transitions associated with monomer → protofibril → fibril assembly (31.Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). For Aβ40, t½ ≈ 4 days (Fig. 1G). The English (H6R) and Tottori (D7N) Aβ40 mutants displayed substantially accelerated kinetics, with t½ ≈ 0.6 days for each (Fig. 1, C, E, and G). Conformational changes in the mutant peptides were complete by day 2 and the spectra from days 3–6 were very similar. Visual inspection of the data shows that maximal values of d[θ]/dt were similar among the three peptides. However, no lag period was observed with the mutant peptides, compared with a lag period of ≈2 days with Aβ40 itself. Shorter observation intervals might reveal a lag time for the mutants, but consideration of the observed maximum d[θ]/dt metric in both systems and the delay intervals before the second CD measurements were made (0.5 or 1 days), suggests that this lag period would be very small (≪1 day). The Aβ42 system displayed similar structural changes to those observed in the Aβ40 system. However, in all cases, the kinetics was accelerated even more and no lag phase was observed for any peptide (subject to the same qualification as noted above for the Aβ40 system) (Fig. 1H). Aβ42 exhibited a t½ < 2 days, approximately 1/2 that of Aβ40. The kinet"

However, reports of new human ESC and iPSC lines vary widely in both methods and analysis of teratoma data. We call for consensus standards to be established to make this assay worthy of its “golden” status. In this journal, researchers have recently participated in a lively discussion about standards that could be used in characterization of human pluripotent stem cells (Daley et al., 2009Daley G.Q.

Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). For mouse cells, the gold standard for proving pluripotency is germline transmission (Bradley et al., 1984Bradley A. Evans M. Kaufman M.H. Robertson E. Nature. 1984; 309: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), which demonstrates the ability to make all cell types, including germ cells. For human cells, the closest surrogate for the germline transmission assay is the generation in immunodeficient mice of human cell-derived teratomas, solid tumors that contain a mixture of differentiated tissues such a neurons, heart muscle, and secretory epithelia (Damjanov, 2005Damjanov I. Stem Cell Rev. 2005; 1: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because of the rich variety of mature histologically distinct tissue types that develop, the teratoma assay is currently regarded as the most rigorous assay to prove pluripotency of human stem cells. Unfortunately, although the end point of a germline transmission assay is simple (a mouse derived from cultured cells), the teratoma assay necessarily lacks this level of absolute clarity. To determine what methods and outcome measures are used for teratoma analysis, we systematically screened the literature from 1998 to 2009 (Table 1). In spite of the gold standard status of the teratoma assay for determining pluripotency, we found that there was little consistency in either methods or reporting of results. The protocols differed widely in key parameters, such as preparation of cells, site of injection, and number of cells injected per animal. We found that the majority of studies do not report key factors, such as a systematic histopathological evaluation or even the number of mice transplanted.Table 1Summary of Our Systematic Literature SurveyPapers ExaminedLines ReportedLines with Teratoma DataAvg.

Note: Papers reporting teratoma data of previously established cell lines (follow-up studies) were not included in this analysis. The variation in reporting of teratoma results brings up the question of this assay's value as a standard for proving pluripotency of human stem cells. Given the accelerating rate of derivation of new human stem cell lines, we would like to propose that the stem cell research community work toward improving the rigor of assays used for defining cell pluripotency, including the teratoma assay. In many ways this situation is analogous to the challenges faced by other groups of scientists whenever novel or little-used technologies capture the attention of researchers in prominent fields. For example, the rapid adoption of microarray technology in the late 1990s led to an explosion of data in the literature, and scientists became concerned about the inconsistency of methods and reporting of microarray data. The lack of standards led to inaccurate reports and the broad scientific community was justifiably suspicious of the methods (Loring, 2006Loring J.F. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1084-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In response to these concerns, users and developers of microarray technology proposed that researchers agree on a set of standards for reporting of microarray data (Brazma et al., 2001Brazma A. Hingamp P. Quackenbush J. Sherlock G. Spellman P. Stoeckert C. Aach J. Ansorge W. Ball C.A. Causton H.C. et al.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar). These criteria, called “Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment” (MIAME), have transformed the reporting of microarray data in the literature, simplifying the review of manuscripts and building confidence in the validity of the data. In this Forum, we would like to initiate a similar conversation about establishing standards for the analysis of human pluripotent stem cells. Focusing on the most highly regarded assay for pluripotency, we propose that stem cell researchers explore a systematic reporting system for teratoma experiments and data. Such standards may aid pluripotent stem cell researchers to better evaluate and compare results across different reprogramming strategies and differentiation protocols and to contribute valuable information about human development. We surveyed more than 1200 original research manuscripts that were published from 1998 to 2009 in English language journals, indexed in NCBI Medline, and describing research on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We also identified 124 original research manuscripts that were published from 2007 to 2009 that report research on human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). For an initial survey of trends and main findings, we analyzed in-depth 95 papers describing the successful derivation of 639 novel hESC lines and 81 papers describing the establishment of 777 novel human iPSC lines (Table 1). Detailed descriptions of reports and teratoma results on the single manuscript level with citations can be accessed in Table S1 available online. To our surprise, we found that for more than half of the 639 published hESC lines (355 lines, 56%) and 64% of the published iPSC lines (501 lines), no teratoma data were included in the manuscripts that reported the establishment of these cell lines. These numbers indicate that the gold standard for demonstration of pluripotency in human cells has been used for only half of novel hESC and human iPSC lines reported in the scientific literature. Although we are unable to analyze the review process of manuscripts, our anecdotal experience is that reviewers for higher-impact journals are more likely to require teratoma data in order to pass peer review. Interestingly, when we analyzed the data, we discovered that our impression was correct for hESCs, but not for iPSCs; for novel hESCs, there was significant positive correlation between the impact (Eigenfactor Article Influence Score) of a journal and inclusion of teratoma results, but for iPSC lines, although there was a trend toward positive correlation, there was no significant distinction among journals (Table 1). A second issue is the reporting of teratoma results. We found that even when a teratoma assay is included, the methodology for inducing teratomas is often poorly reported. The descriptions in the methods sections varied so widely that it was impossible to classify them into groups. To illustrate the problem, we describe several types of reporting that are representative for the group of papers, without identifying the specific papers. The number of injected cells is often reported with vague quantifications, for example “clumps of 200–300 cells” without mentioning how many of such clumps were transplanted. Moreover, cell numbers for induction of teratomas vary widely; even transplantations into the same site are performed with cell numbers varying more than three orders of magnitude (e.g., 3000 to 5 million cells for testicular injections). The time “in vivo” varies from 4 to 15 weeks, and the size of the resected tumors is mentioned in very few cases. Only 16 of the hESC and 3 of the iPSC papers mention the passage number of the cells used for teratoma experiments. Just 16 of the hESC and only 10 of the iPSC papers note the number of animals used for the experiments. In six hESC reports and five papers on iPSCs that report teratomas, no single detail on how the teratomas were induced and analyzed is given. In addition to the variability in information reported for generating teratomas, there is also a large inconsistency in reporting of analysis of the tumors. The teratomas are examined in most cases by classic histological methods, via hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) stains, and usually only isolated examples of tissue types are provided, with no quantification or basis for comparison across studies. In general, a histopathologist is consulted to identify tissue types within the tumor, and to classify them as derivatives from ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm. Only a small fraction of the studies (17 of 75 hESC papers and 16 of 67 iPSC papers that provided data on teratoma assays in first reports of novel cell lines) included immunohistochemical staining of teratomas for differentiation markers. It is not possible to quantify the types of tissues reported because of the heterogeneity of the reported results, but we have the impression that the histological analysis is generally subjective and dependent on the experience of the pathologist. We were also surprised to find that five hESC lines were reported to fail to form teratomas when injected into immunodeficient mice, and several lines formed only small tumors consisting mainly of fluid-filled cysts. Also, individual reports indicated that it was difficult to obtain well-differentiated teratomas from certain iPSC lines. This trend may be relevant to our understanding of pluripotency, because the “definitive” pluripotent stem cell phenotype remains ill defined and it has been reported by several independent groups that even partially reprogrammed iPSC lines possess the ability to form teratomas (Chan et al., 2009Chan E.M. Ratanasirintrawoot S. Park I.H. Manos P.D. Loh Y.H. Huo H. Miller J.D. Hartung O. Rho J. Ince T.A. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The clear conclusion from our review of the literature is that accepted and practiced standards for both conducting and reporting teratoma assays currently do not exist. We would like to argue that if teratomas are to be regarded as the gold standard for demonstrating pluripotency, then the stem cell community would benefit from development of consensus standards for performing and reporting teratoma results. Another important reason for improving reporting of teratoma results is the tremendous amount of information that they can provide beyond their use as proof of pluripotency. The cellular structure of teratomas has the potential to offer insights into the development of human embryonic tissues and differences among cell lines. There are numerous questions that could be addressed by following consensus criteria for reporting teratoma results. For example, does the site of injection and number of cells affect the types of tissues that develop and/or the timing of their development? How mature do tissues become in teratomas—do they more resemble early stages of human development or fully differentiated adult tissues? Does the source of cell type for reprogramming to iPSCs bias the differentiation of the cells: for example, if cartilage precursors are reprogrammed, are they better at making cartilage than cells reprogrammed from dermal fibroblasts? Can we use teratoma analysis to determine whether clinical transplants of derivatives of particular stem cell lines are more likely to form dangerous tumors than others? Of the two distinct issues regarding teratomas, agreement about the mechanics of teratoma generation (dissociation methods, number of cells, site of injection) may be easier to achieve than coming to a consensus about standards for interpretation of teratoma results (tumor descriptions, identification of tissues). Because histological analysis of embryonic tissues is a skill that had its dominance in the 1950s and 1960s, very few of the current generation of stem cell researchers has any experience at all in histology. As a result, the task of assessing the tissue content of teratomas is usually outsourced to professional pathologists, and the stem cell researchers who generated the teratomas typically learn very little beyond a “checklist” of isolated examples of derivatives of the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. This type of reporting adds little to our knowledge about the variety of tissues and cell types that develop in teratomas; there is not even a standard basis for the identification of a structure as a derivative of a particular germline. As an anecdotal example, we recently sought input from a local pathologist colleague during our analysis of a group of teratomas generated from human iPSCs. She noted the frequent appearance of yolk sac cells in the sections. The yolk sac is an extraembryonic endodermal tissue, and yolk sac tumors, which are aggressively metastatic, are most often found in testicular tissue. Thus, it is reasonable for this cell type to appear in stem cell-derived human teratomas. But surprisingly, the literature contains no reports of yolk sac tissue in tumors generated for the purpose of proving pluripotency of human stem cells. With our preoccupation with identifying tissues from the three germ layers, most of us have lost sight of the fact that extraembryonic tissues play an essential role during embryogenesis, and there is no reason not to expect to find them in teratomas. This observation raises an interesting point that deserves further discussion: in filling out the checklist of germ layers at the request of reviewers of a publication, is it important whether the histological identification of endodermal derivatives in teratomas correctly distinguishes embryonic from extraembryonic tissues? We acknowledge that this Forum article raises many questions and addresses only a few. In particular, we have highlighted that reports of human pluripotent lines are often devoid of teratoma data, and when the assays are conducted, they are performed, analyzed, and reported inconsistently across the literature. A recent methods publication authored by the ISSCR standards committee (Gertow et al., 2007Gertow K. Przyborski S. Loring J.F. Auerbach J.M. Epifano O. Otonkoski T. Damjanov I. Ahrlund-Richter L. Curr. Protoc. Stem Cell Biol. 2007; (Chapter 1, Unit1B 4)PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that members of the field can come together to begin to establish consistency in methodology and reporting. To extend this discussion, we have compiled a list of criteria (Table S2) that could potentially be incorporated into a standard teratoma reporting system. We would like to promote the idea that having standards for reporting methods and results of teratoma assays will benefit the stem cell community, not only by making the assay more reproducible, but also by providing deeper knowledge about human development.

https://openalex.org/W1970237920,"In neurons, synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) is thought to mediate the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane when presynaptic Ca2+ levels rise. However, in vitro reconstitution experiments have failed to recapitulate key characteristics of Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion. Using an in vitro single-vesicle fusion assay, we found that membrane-anchored Syt1 enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity and fusion speed. This stimulatory activity of membrane-anchored Syt1 dropped as the Ca2+ level rose beyond physiological levels. Thus, Syt1 requires the membrane anchor to stimulate vesicle fusion at physiological Ca2+ levels and may function as a dynamic presynaptic Ca2+ sensor to control the probability of neurotransmitter release."

https://openalex.org/W2021987221,"Proper protein localization is essential for all cells. However, the precise mechanism by which high fidelity is achieved is not well understood for any protein-targeting pathway. To address this fundamental question, we investigated the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway in Escherichia coli, which delivers proteins to the bacterial inner membrane through recognition of signal sequences on cargo proteins. Fidelity was thought to arise from the inability of SRP to bind strongly to incorrect cargos. Using biophysical assays, we found that incorrect cargos were also rejected through a series of checkpoints during subsequent steps of targeting. Thus, high fidelity of substrate selection is achieved through the cumulative effect of multiple checkpoints; this principle may be generally applicable to other pathways involving selective signal recognition."

Highly significant differences between cytokine levels of old and young subjects all were gender specific. For T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies, mean ratios of IFN-γ generation for healthy old to young subjects were 0.22 for men (P<0.001;n=15) and 3.35 for women (P<0.001; n=13), and those of IL-17 were 0.30 for men (P< 0.001) and no difference for women. CD8 T cells were the source of high IFN-γ in healthy old women. For old men with an inflammatory or immune disease (n=10), mean old to young ratios of T-cell-generated IFN-γ and IL-17 increased with disease severity up to 5.78 and 2.97 (both P<0.01), respectively, without changes for old women with similar diseases (n=12). For differentiated LPS-stimulated monocytes, old to young ratios of TNF-α and IL-6 generation were high only in women with immune or inflammatory disease (2.38, P<0.05 and 1.62, P<0.01, respectively), whereas ratios of IFN-γ-evoked IP-10 chemokine were low in all groups.

https://openalex.org/W1973804733,"Changes in ambient temperature represent a major physiological challenge to membranes of poikilothermic organisms. In plants, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized omega-3 fatty-acid desaturases (Fad3) increase the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids at cooler temperatures, but the FAD3 genes themselves are typically not up-regulated during this adaptive response. Here, we expressed two closely related plant FAD3 genes in yeast cells and found that their enzymes produced significantly different amounts of omega-3 fatty acids and that these differences correlated to differences in rates of protein turnover. Domain-swapping and mutagenesis experiments revealed that each protein contained a degradation signal in its N terminus and that the charge density of a PEST-like sequence within this region was largely responsible for the differences in rates of protein turnover. The half-life of each Fad3 protein was increased at cooler temperatures, and protein degradation required specific components of the ER-associated degradation pathway including the Cdc48 adaptor proteins Doa1, Shp1, and Ufd2. Expression of the Fad3 proteins in tobacco cells incubated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 further confirmed that they were degraded via the proteasomal pathway in plants. Collectively, these findings indicate that Fad3 protein abundance is regulated by a combination of cis-acting degradation signals and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that modulation of Fad3 protein amounts in response to temperature may represent one mechanism of homeoviscous adaptation in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1978530429,"Mycobacteria store triacylglycerols (TGs) in the form of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) during hypoxia-induced nonreplicating persistence. These bacteria are phenotypically drug-resistant and therefore are believed to be the cause for prolonged tuberculosis treatment. LDs are also associated with bacilli in tuberculosis patient sputum and hypervirulent strains. Although proteins bound to LDs are well characterized in eukaryotes, the identities and functions of such proteins have not been described in mycobacteria. Here, we have identified five proteins: Tgs1 (BCG3153c), Tgs2 (BCG3794c), BCG1169c, BCG1489c, and BCG1721, which are exclusively associated with LDs purified from hypoxic nonreplicating Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Disruption of genes tgs1, tgs2, BCG1169c, and BCG1489c in M. bovis BCG revealed that they are indeed involved in TG metabolism. We also characterized BCG1721, an essential bi-functional enzyme capable of promoting buildup and hydrolysis of TGs, depending on the metabolic state. Nonreplicating mycobacteria overexpressing a BCG1721 construct with an inactive lipase domain displayed a phenotype of attenuated TG breakdown and regrowth upon resuscitation. In addition, by heterologous expression in baker's yeast, these mycobacterial proteins also co-localized with LDs and complemented a lipase-deficient yeast strain, indicating that neutral lipid deposition and homeostasis in eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms are functionally related. The demonstrated functional role of BCG1721 to support growth upon resuscitation makes this novel LD-associated factor a potential new target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2068032353,"The Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib is remarkably effective in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), although drug resistance is an emerging problem. Myeloid Src family kinases such as Hck and Lyn are often overexpressed in imatinib-resistant CML cells that lack Bcr-Abl mutations. Here we tested whether Hck overexpression is sufficient to induce imatinib resistance using both wild-type Hck and a mutant (Hck-T338A) that is uniquely sensitive to the pyrazolo-pyrimidine inhibitor, NaPP1. Expression of either kinase in K562 CML cells caused resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis and inhibition of soft-agar colony formation. Treatment with NaPP1 restored sensitivity to imatinib in cells expressing T338A but not wild-type Hck, demonstrating that resistance requires Hck kinase activity. NaPP1 also reduced Hck-mediated phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl at sites that may affect imatinib sensitivity exclusively in cells expressing Hck-T338A. These data show that elevated Src family kinase activity is sufficient to induce imatinib resistance through a mechanism that may involve phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl."

In the nucleus, Nrf2 activates a myriad of antioxidant and defensive genes that protect cells. Nrf2 is then exported out of the nucleus and degraded. INrf2 serves as a substrate adaptor to link Nrf2 to Cul3 and Rbx1. Cul3 and Rbx1 make up the ubiquitin ligase complex that is responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. Previously we have shown a feedback autoregulatory loop between Nrf2 and INrf2 indicating that Nrf2 regulates INrf2 by controlling its transcription. Here we are extending this research by demonstrating the presence of another feedback autoregulatory loop between Cul3-Rbx1 and Nrf2. Experiments using Hepa-1 and HepG2 cells indicate that Nrf2 controls its own degradation by regulating expression and induction of Cul3-Rbx1 genes. Treatment with the antioxidant tert-Butylhydroquinone (t-BHQ) leads to induction of Cul3-Rbx1 genes. Mutagenesis and transfection experiments identified an antioxidant response element in the forward and reverse strands of the proximal Cul3 and Rbx1 promoters, respectively, that Nrf2 binds and regulates expression and antioxidant induction of the Cul3-Rbx1 genes. In addition, short interfering RNA inhibition and overexpression of Nrf2 led to a respective decrease and increase in Cul3-Rbx1 gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2066223581,"The identification of hereditary familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1) corroborated the causative role of amyloid-beta peptides with 42 amino acid residues (Abeta42) in the pathogenesis of AD. Although most FAD mutations are known to increase Abeta42 levels, mutations within the APP GxxxG motif are known to lower Abeta42 levels by attenuating transmembrane sequence dimerization. Here, we show that aberrant Abeta42 levels of FAD mutations can be rescued by GxxxG mutations. The combination of the APP-GxxxG mutation G33A with APP-FAD mutations yielded a constant 60% decrease of Abeta42 levels and a concomitant 3-fold increase of Abeta38 levels compared with the Gly(33) wild-type as determined by ELISA. In the presence of PS1-FAD mutations, the effects of G33A were attenuated, apparently attributable to a different mechanism of PS1-FAD mutants compared with APP-FAD mutants. Our results contribute to a general understanding of the mechanism how APP is processed by the gamma-secretase module and strongly emphasize the potential of the GxxxG motif in the prevention of sporadic AD as well as FAD."
https://openalex.org/W2130165454,"In mammalian cells, cytotoxic stress triggers several signaling cascades that converge in the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2alpha, shuttling of nuclear RNA-binding proteins such as TIA-1 to the cytoplasm, and aggregation of most cellular mRNAs into TIA-1-containing stress granules (SGs). As a result, protein synthesis is greatly impaired. Here we describe different dynamics of endogenous transcripts according to their cellular location, in response to stress. While cytosolic mRNAs aggregate into SGs, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -bound transcripts escape sequestration. This has been specifically demonstrated using the multidrug resistance transporter gene (MDR1) as a model and showing that chimeric RNA constructs can be directed to the cytosol or tethered to the ER depending on the nature of the chimera, in response to stress. In addition, polysome profile analyses indicate that, on stress, ribosomes do not disengage from ER-associated transcripts (puromycin insensitive) and recover their translation status faster than SG-targeted cytosolic mRNAs once the stress is lifted. These findings have important implications for cell survival given that many membrane proteins, which are translated at the ER, have important roles in detoxification."

In the case of the common intermediate benzoate, the ring cleavage substrates are either catechol (in bacteria) or 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuate, mainly in fungi). We have shown before that many bacteria, e.g. Azoarcus evansii, the organism studied here, use a completely different mechanism. This elaborate pathway requires formation of benzoyl-CoA, followed by an oxygenase reaction and a nonoxygenolytic ring cleavage. Benzoyl-CoA transformation is catalyzed by the iron-containing benzoyl-CoA oxygenase (BoxB) in conjunction with an FAD and iron-sulfur centers containing reductase (BoxA), which donates electrons from NADPH. Here we show that benzoyl-CoA oxygenase actually does not form the 2,3-dihydrodiol of benzoyl-CoA, as formerly postulated, but the 2,3-epoxide.

https://openalex.org/W2061005033,"Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) functions both intracellularly as part of fatty acid metabolism and extracellularly as diazepam binding inhibitor, the precursor of endozepine peptides. Two of these peptides, ODN and TTN, bind to the GABA(A) receptor and modulate its sensitivity to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We have found that depolarization of mouse primary astrocytes induces the rapid release and processing of ACBP to the active peptides. We previously showed that ODN can trigger the rapid sporulation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium. Using this bioassay, we now show that astrocytes release the endozepine peptides within 10 min of exposure to the steroids cortisol, pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate, or progesterone. ACBP lacks a signal sequence for secretion through the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway and its secretion is not affected by addition of brefeldin A, a well known inhibitor of the classical secretion pathway, suggesting that it follows an unconventional pathway for secretion. Moreover, induction of autophagy by addition of rapamycin also resulted in rapid release of ACBP indicating that this protein uses components of the autophagy pathway for secretion. Following secretion, ACBP is proteolytically cleaved to the active neuropeptides by protease activity on the surface of astrocytes. Neurosteroids, such as pregnenolone sulfate, were previously shown to modulate the excitatory/inhibitory balance in brain through increased release of glutamate and decreased release of GABA. These effects of steroids in neurons will be reinforced by the release of endozepines from astrocytes shown here, and suggest an orchestrated astrocyte-neuron cross-talk that can affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions."

Rev. 1997; 24: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PDGF/PDGF-β receptor signal axis mediates dopamine receptor signals and inhibits γ-aminobutyric acid receptor activation (15Oak J.N. Lavine N. Van Tol H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Valenzuela C.F. Kazlauskas A. Brozowski S.J. Weiner J.L. Demali K.A. McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Dunwiddie T.V. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1099-1107PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to PDGFs, PDGF-β receptor has also been implicated in neuroprotection after injurious events. For example, focal ischemia in rat brain causes a rapid increase in PDGF-B chain mRNA transcripts with a concomitant rise in PDGF-β receptor expression in the central nervous system (6Egawa-Tsuzuki T. Ohno M. Tanaka N. Takeuchi Y. Uramoto H. Faigle R. Funa K. Ishii Y. Sasahara M. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 186: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on these vital roles of PDGF in the central nervous system, we sought to explore whether PDGF also was critical for long term potentiation, the most studied form of synaptic plasticity. Long term forms of learning and memory are dependent on rapid synthesis of new RNA and proteins in the cells (17Davis H.P. Squire L.R. Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). A set of immediate early genes including Arc/Arg3.1 (18Link W. Konietzko U. Kauselmann G. Krug M. Schwanke B. Frey U. Kuhl D.

Neuron. 2004; 44: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have been shown to play crucial roles in transcription-dependent plasticity. Regulation of Arc/Arg3.1 is very unique in that in stimulated neurons Arc mRNA had been shown to translocate from the nucleus to the dendrites where it gets translated and incorporated into the postsynaptic zone with other cytoskeletal proteins (22Steward O. Worley P.F. Neuron. 2001; 30: 227-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 23Steward O. Wallace C.S. Lyford G.L. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). A critical role of Arc in synaptic plasticity has also been demonstrated in studies involving Arc/Arg3.1 knockdown, an effect that results in selective deficits in long term synaptic potentiation (24Guzowski J.F. McNaughton B.L. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Thus, Arc expression in the neurite has been strongly suggested as an index of synapse activation. In addition to high frequency stimulation, neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factors that exert multifunctional effects on the survival/development of central nervous system can also induce long term potentiation (25Yin Y. Edelman G.M. Vanderklish P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2368-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although PDGF shares functional and signaling similarities with neurotrophins, its role in long term potentiation and synaptic plasticity remains poorly resolved. In the present study we, thus, sought to explore the role of PDGF-B in the induction of synaptic plasticity with a focus on long term potentiation and the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of Arc expression in the hippocampus. These findings can have possible implications in the development of central nervous system therapeutics targeted against neurodegenerative diseases. Recombinant human PDGF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Because PDGF, but not PDGF-AA, is implicated in preventing delayed neuronal death after forebrain ischemia in rats, especially in the hippocampus (26Iihara K. Hashimoto N. Tsukahara T. Sakata M. Yanamoto H. Taniguchi T. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), where it is closely involved in the development of long term potentiation, in the present study we restricted studies to the role of PDGF and not the A chain. The phosphatidylinositol-3′ kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem. STI-571, an inhibitor of PDGF receptor-tyrosine kinase, was obtained from Novartis, Basel, Switzerland. Dominant negative and constitutively active constructs of MEK were provided from Dr. Young Han Lee (Konkuk University, Korea). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Billerica, MA). Transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and the translation inhibitor actidione were purchased from Sigma. Pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6N mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). All of animals were housed under conditions of constant temperature and humidity on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle, with lights on at 0700 h. Food and water were available ad libitum. All animal procedures were performed according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Hippocampal brain slices were prepared from 15–35-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats as previous described (27Xiong H. Baskys A. Wojtowicz J.M. Brain Res. 1996; 737: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. Brains were quickly removed from the cranial cavity and placed into ice-cold (4 °C), pre-oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Hippocampi were dissected out, and transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm in thickness) were cut using a tissue chopper. Slices were kept in a humidified/oxygenated holding chamber at room temperature for at least 1 h before being transferred to a recording chamber. In the recording chamber, single hippocampal slices were submerged and continuously perfused (2.0 ml/min) with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 124.0 mm NaCl, 3.0 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm NaH2PO3, 26.0 mm NaHCO3, and 10.0 mm glucose, equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.35–7.45. The temperature of the perfusate was maintained at 30 ± 1 °C with an automatic temperature controller (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). Drugs were applied onto slices via incubation (1 h). Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were elicited by a constant current stimulation (0.05 Hz, 50–400 μA) of Schaffer collateral-commissural axons using an insulated bipolar tungsten electrode. Intensity and duration of stimulation were adjusted to generate ∼30–40% of a maximal response. Evoked EPSPs were recorded with an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA) in the CA1 dendrite field (stratum radium). Recordings were made with borosilicated glass microelectrodes with a tip diameter of 2.5–5.0 μm and a resistance of 1–5 megaohms when filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. A 20-min control recording was conducted in each experiment once the adjustment of stimulation parameters was achieved. Each recording trial was an average of 3 consecutive sweeps. High frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 500 ms) was delivered twice in 20-s intervals at the same intensity as that employed in test pulses (low frequency). Electrical signals were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at a frequency of 2.5 kHz using a Digidata 1320 interface (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Data were stored on a desktop PC and analyzed off-line using pCLAMP 10 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The initial slope of the EPSPs was analyzed and expressed in percentage of basal level (the average of initial slopes from the first 30 min was treated as 100%, i.e. the basal level). In bar graphs, the magnitudes of long term potentiation were quantified at the time point of 60 min after high frequency stimulation. Microinjection was performed in male C57BL/6N mice, 12 weeks old, weighing 22–24 g. The mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isofluorane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus for injection using the stereotaxic coordinates, AP-2.0 mm posterior, ML-1.6 mm lateral to midline, and DV-1.5 mm to bregma as described by Nunes-de-Souza et al. (28Nunes-de-Souza R.L. Canto-de-Souza A. Rodgers R.J. Brain Res. 2002; 927: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All microinjections were performed using a 33-gauge stainless steel injector connected to a 10-μl syringe, which was operated by an influx pump. 1 μl solution was injected into the dorsal hippocampus at 0.15 μl per min. The concentration of PDGF used was 500 ng/μl, and vehicle was used as control. At the end of the injection the needle was kept in situ for a further 2 min. Three hours post-injection the mice were perfused and decapitated. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% bovine serum albumin. After blocking, cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with different antibodies (Egr-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After washes cells, were incubated with the secondary goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (1:500). For negative controls cells were treated as described above, except that the primary antibody treatment was omitted. For immunohistochemistry, mice were perfused by transcardial perfusion using chilled 4% paraformaldehyde. Free-floating sections encompassing the entire hippocampus were sectioned at 40 μm on a cryostat. For Arc immunostaining, tissue sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The Vector M.O.M immunodetection kit was used to avoid the cross-reaction between mouse tissue and the primary Arc antibody, which was generated in mice. Immunostaining was visualized by using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as the substrate. Primary rat neurons were prepared as described earlier with slight modifications (29Yao H.H. Ding J.H. Zhou F. Wang F. Hu L.F. Sun T. Hu G. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 948-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampus was dissected from embryonic day 18–19 Sprague-Dawley rats and dissociated with a mild mechanical trituration. Dissociated cells were seeded first in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 1 day, the cultures were supplemented with serum-free neurobasal medium containing B27 (50:1), 2 mm glutamax, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In all of the experiments cells were cultured for 7 days before treatment with PDGF or the inhibitors. The SH-SY5Y cell line was cultured following the protocols as our previous paper (10Peng. F. Dhillon. N. Callen. S. Yao. H. Bokhari. S. Zhu. X. Baydoun. H.H. Buch. S J. Neurovirol. 2008; 14: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Treated cells were lysed using the Mammalian Cell Lysis kit (Sigma) and the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Pierce). Cell lysates were subjected to the separation by 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (about 20 μg of protein per well) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blots were then probed with antibodies recognizing Arc (Santa Cruz,1:200), Egr-1 (Santa Cruz, 1:500), Egr-3 (Santa Cruz, 1: 500), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; Cell Signaling, 1:500), and ERK (Cell Signaling, 1:500). Signals were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). All experiments were repeated four times individually, and representative blots are presented in the figures. To examine whether PDGF-mediated regulation of Egr-1 occurred at the transcriptional and/or translational level, rat hippocampal neurons were pretreated with either actinomycin D (transcription blocker, at 10 and 20 μm) or with actidione (translational inhibitor, at 5 and 50 μm) followed by exposure to PDGF (20 ng/ml). The RNA and proteins extracted from rat hippocampus neurons were subjected to reverse transcription-PCR or Western blot, respectively. The sequences of rat Egr-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were as follows: rat Egr-1 sense primer, 5′-CCCAAACTGGAGGAGATGA-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GGAGGCAGAGGAAGACGAT-3′; Rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense primer, 5′- CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GGAAGGCCATGCCAGTGA-3′. Amplifications were carried out for 36 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 56 °C for 40 s, 72 °C for 1 min with final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The changes in Ca2+ were monitored using Fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The rat primary hippocampal neurons in 35-mm culture dishes were rinsed twice with Bath solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), incubated in Bath solution containing 5 μm Fluo-4/AM with 5% CO2, 95% O2 at 37 °C for 40 min, rinsed twice with the Bath solution, mounted on a perfusion chamber, and scanned every second using confocal microscopy (X400) (Fluoview 300; Olympus). Fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, and the emitted light was read at 515 nm. All analyses of Ca2+ were processed at a single-cell level. To normalize for variations in initial fluorescence values, the values of the Ca2+ response were divided by the resting fluorescence value (calculated as the mean of at least three values before the application of PDGF). siRNA target against PDGF-βR and Egr-1 were obtained from Dharmacon (Boulder, CO). SH-SY5Y cells were plated in a 24-well plate at a density of 4 × 104 cells per well 1 day before transfection. Before transfection, cell culture medium was replaced with 250 μl of pre-warmed culture medium. Two μl of Novagen Ribojuice siRNA transfection reagent (EMD Chemicals, Inc, Gibbstown, NJ) was then combined with 48 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature. The Egr-1 siRNA was then added into the mixture described above to a final concentration of 150 nm. The siRNA and the reagent mixture were then incubated for 20 min at room temperature after which the combined mixture was added to the cells. The cell culture plate was shaken gently for 5 s and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate) with slight modifications. Briefly, after treatment of the cells, 18.5% fresh formaldehyde was added directly into the medium at a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde and incubated for 10 min at room temperature followed by quenching with 10× glycine. The cells were then scraped using 2 ml of pre-chilled phosphate-buffered saline containing a 1× protease inhibitor mixture. The cell pellet was harvested by spinning at 800 × g at 4 °C followed by adding lysis buffer (provided in the kit) to harvest nuclei. DNA was sheared by sonication. Fifty μl of the sheared cross-linked chromatin was then mixed with 20 μl of protein A magnetic beads and 5 μg of the corresponding antibody diluted in 450 μl of dilution buffer followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C. The magnetic beads binding antibody-chromatin complex was then washed with 0.5 ml each of a series of cold wash buffers in the order of low salt buffer, high salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and finally with Tris-EDTA buffer. The cross-linked protein-DNA complexes were reversed to free DNA by incubation at 62 °C for 2 h and purified using DNA purification spin columns following the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the purified DNA was subjected to PCR to identify the promoter region containing GC-rich sequence estrogen response element (30Li L. Carter J. Gao X. Whitehead J. Tourtellotte W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10286-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The sequence of the primers used to identify the promoter bound by transcription factors Egr-1/Egr-3 were as follows: sense, 5′-GAGAGGGCGCGGGCGGGCTCTGGCG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCGGCGGCTTTTTATGCTGCGCGGG-3′. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Student's t test. Results were judged statistically significant if p < 0.05 by analysis of variance. Because the expression of Arc/Arg3.1 gene is implicated in synapse plasticity and long term potentiation, we first wanted to investigate the effects of PDGF on Arc expression in primary rat hippocampal neurons to test whether PDGF plays a role in synaptic plasticity. To determine the optimal time of Arc induction, hippocampal neurons were treated with rhuman PDGF (20 ng/ml) for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h followed by cell lysis and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, Arc induction was a rapid and early event with induction beginning as early as 1 h post PDGF treatment and reached a peak at about 2–3 h post stimulation. To optimize the dose of PDGF, hippocampal neurons were treated with varying doses of PDGF (2–500 ng/ml) for 2 h and subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, the dose-curve data demonstrated that PDGF concentrations as low as 5 ng/ml was able to induce Arc expression with peak induction at 20–100 ng/ml of PDGF. Pretreatment of hippocampal neurons with the receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571 (1 μm) for 1 h resulted in abrogation of PDGF-induced Arc expression (Fig. 1C), thus, underscoring the role of PDGF receptor-tyrosine kinase in this process. We acknowledge the fact that STI-571 is not a specific antagonist for PDGF-βR, as it is also known to inhibit PDGF-αR as well as other kinase activities. Hence, as an alternative approach we next sought to knock down PDGF-βR expression in neurons using the siRNA strategy. As expected, transfection of cells with PDGF-βR siRNA resulted in inhibition of receptor expression (Fig. 1D) and also abrogated the expression of PDGF-mediated induction of Arc (Fig. 1E), thereby confirming the role of PDGF-βR in this process.FIGURE 2Time course and average magnitude of long term potentiation recorded in the Schaffer-collateral to CA1 synapses from control slices (●), slices treated with PDGF (▴), and slices treated with PDGF+STI-571 (□).

High frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 500 ms ×2) was delivered at the time indicated by an arrow. Note that PDGF induced an enhancement of long term potentiation and the blockade of PDGF-induced enhancement of long term potentiation by STI-571, Representative field EPSPs (fEPSPs) recorded from slices of control, treated with PDGF, and treated with PDGF+STI-571 are shown at the top of the figure. Ctrl, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the observed increase of Arc expression in hippocampus neurons in vitro, we sought to explore the expression of Arc in the brains of mice hippocampi injected with PDGF. Three hours post-injection of PDGF in the dorsal hippocampus, the mice were decapitated and subjected to the Arc immunostaining. Injection of PDGF resulted in a robust increase in Arc immunostaining in the mice hippocampi compared with the saline injected animals (Fig. 1F), which was abrogated by pretreatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-STI-571. Having determined that PDGF induced Arc expression and that Arc expression is implicated in long term potentiation, we next sought to test the effect of PDGF on long term potentiation. High frequency stimulation of Shaffer-collateral fibers produced robust long term potentiation recorded in CA1 region of non-treated (control) hippocampal slices. The average magnitude of long term potentiation measured 40 min after high frequency stimulation was 162.1 ± 9.9% of basal level (Fig. 2, n = 10). In contrast, incubation of hippocampal slices with PDGF produced an enhancement of long term potentiation with an average magnitude of 223.2 ± 14.9% that of basal level (Fig. 2, n = 9), in comparison with the long term potentiation magnitude recorded in control slices significantly (p < 0.01), suggesting an enhancement of long term potentiation by PDGF. To determine whether PDGF-induced enhancement of long term potentiation is mediated via PDGF receptors, we co-incubated hippocampal slices with PDGF and STI-571, a PDGF receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Our results showed that the average magnitude of long term potentiation recorded in slices co-incubated with PDGF and STI-571 was 174.1 ± 12.7% that of basal level (n = 6). Compared with the long term potentiation magnitude recorded in slices treated with PDGF, the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05), indicating a blockade of PDGF-induced enhancement of long term potentiation by STI-571. Bath application of PDGF alone had no significant effect on basal synaptic transmission (n = 4, data not shown). Several signal pathways have been implicated in PDGF induced biological responses including the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and calcium release pathways (31Zhang H. Bajraszewski N. Wu E. Wang H. Moseman A.P.

Spine J. 2007; 16: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To elucidate the roles of MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways in PDGF-mediated Arc expression, we pretreated rat hippocampal neurons with either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) or the MEK inhibitor U0126 (20 μm) for 1 h before exposing the neurons to PDGF for 30 min. PDGF-mediated induction of Arc was abrogated completely by pretreating the cells with the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 3A). To confirm the involvement of ERK pathway in PDGF-mediated Arc expression, neurons were transfected with constructs encoding either a dominant-negative (DN) or the constitutively active (CA) form of MEK. As shown in Fig. 3B, neurons transfected with the dominant-negative form of MEK failed to induce PDGF-mediated expression of Arc. Transfection of neurons with constitutively active MEK, on the other hand, resulted in PDGF-mediated induction of Arc expression, as expected (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the MEK inhibitor, PDGF-mediated induction of Arc was unaffected by the PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 3C). Based on the fact that the early growth response transcription factors Egr-1 and -3 play a role in Arc induction (30Li L. Carter J. Gao X. Whitehead J. Tourtellotte W.G. Mol."

To address this issue, we screened for HU resistance in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and identified seventeen unique catalase mutants, thereby establishing that HU toxicity depends on catalase in vivo. We further demonstrated that catalase is a direct HU target by showing that HU acts as a competitive inhibitor of catalase-mediated hydrogen peroxide decomposition. Considering also that catalase can accelerate HU decomposition in vitro and that co-treatment with another catalase inhibitor alleviates HU effects in vivo, our findings suggests that HU could act as a catalase-activated pro-drug.

https://openalex.org/W1980032779,"Assembly of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) with their associated proteins regulates the coupling of VDCCs with upstream and downstream cellular events. Among the four isoforms of the Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM1 to -4), we have previously reported that VDCC β-subunits physically interact with the long α isoform of the presynaptic active zone scaffolding protein RIM1 (RIM1α) via its C terminus containing the C2B domain. This interaction cooperates with RIM1α-Rab3 interaction to support neurotransmitter exocytosis by anchoring vesicles in the vicinity of VDCCs and by maintaining depolarization-triggered Ca2+ influx as a result of marked inhibition of voltage-dependent inactivation of VDCCs. However, physiological functions have not yet been elucidated for RIM3 and RIM4, which exist only as short γ isoforms (γ-RIMs), carrying the C-terminal C2B domain common to RIMs but not the Rab3-binding region and other structural motifs present in the α-RIMs, including RIM1α. Here, we demonstrate that γ-RIMs also exert prominent suppression of VDCC inactivation via direct binding to β-subunits. In the pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, this common functional feature allows native RIMs to enhance acetylcholine secretion, whereas γ-RIMs are uniquely different from α-RIMs in blocking localization of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles near the plasma membrane. γ-RIMs as well as α-RIMs show wide distribution in central neurons, but knockdown of γ-RIMs attenuated glutamate release to a lesser extent than that of α-RIMs in cultured cerebellar neurons. The results suggest that sustained Ca2+ influx through suppression of VDCC inactivation by RIMs is a ubiquitous property of neurons, whereas the extent of vesicle anchoring to VDCCs at the plasma membrane may depend on the competition of α-RIMs with γ-RIMs for VDCC β-subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2040398099,"Several important genes that are involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling are switched on by virtue of CRE response elements in their promoters. The upstream signaling mechanisms that inflammatory mediators use to activate cAMP response elements (CREs) are poorly understood. Endothelin (ET) is an important vasoactive mediator that plays roles in inflammation, vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis by activating 7 transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Here we characterized the mechanisms ET-1 uses to regulate CRE-dependent remodeling genes in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. These studies revealed activation pathways involving a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) autocrine loop and an interlinked calcium-dependent pathway. We found that ET-1 activated several CRE response genes in vascular smooth muscle cells, particularly COX-2, amphiregulin, follistatin, inhibin-beta-A, and CYR61. ET-1 also activated two other genes epiregulin and HB-EGF. Amphiregulin, follistatin, and inhibin-beta-A and epiregulin were activated by an autocrine loop involving cPLA2, arachidonic acid release, COX-2-dependent PGI(2) synthesis, and IP receptor-linked elevation of cAMP leading to CRE transcription activation. In contrast COX-2, CYR61, and HB-EGF transcription were regulated in a calcium-dependent, COX-2 independent, manner. Observations with IP receptor antagonists and COX-2 inhibitors were confirmed with IP receptor or COX-2-specific small interfering RNAs. ET-1 increases in intracellular calcium and gene transcription were dependent upon ET(a) activation and calcium influx through T type voltage-dependent calcium channels. These studies give important insights into the upstream signaling mechanisms used by G protein-coupled receptor-linked mediators such as ET-1, to activate CRE response genes involved in angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, inflammation, and carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2000674065,"Infection with the obligate bacterial intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis leads to the sustained activation of the small GTPase RAS and many of its downstream signaling components. In particular, the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK and the calcium-dependent phospholipase cPLA2 are activated and are important for the onset of inflammatory responses. In this study we tested if activation of ERK and cPLA2 occurred as a result of RAS signaling during infection and determined the relative contribution of these signaling components to chlamydial replication and survival. We provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that during infection RAS, ERK, and, to a lesser extent, cPLA2 activation are uncoupled, suggesting that Chlamydia activates individual components of this signaling pathway in a non-canonical manner. In human cell lines, inhibition of ERK or cPLA2 signaling did not adversely impact C. trachomatis replication. In contrast, in murine cells, inhibition of ERK and cPLA2 played a significant protective role against C. trachomatis. We determined that cPLA2-deficient murine cells are permissive for C. trachomatis replication because of their impaired expression of β interferon and the induction of immunity-related GTPases (IRG) important for the containment of intracellular pathogens. Furthermore, the MAPK p38 was primarily responsible for cPLA2 activation in Chlamydia-infected cells and IRG expression. Overall, these findings define a previously unrecognized role for cPLA2 in the induction of cell autonomous cellular immunity to Chlamydia and highlight the many non-canonical signaling pathways engaged during infection.

Mammalian cells detect microbial invaders and activate signaling pathways to restrict pathogen growth and to initiate the release of soluble mediators that recruit immune cells with antimicrobial functions (1Mogensen T.H.

Indeed, ERK-mediated signaling is required for the robust induction of inflammatory responses responsible for the bulk of the pathology (e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility) associated with recurrent and chronic genital chlamydial infections (2Buchholz K.R.

Chlamydia infections begin with the attachment of an elementary body (EB), the invasive but non-replicative form of the pathogen, to epithelial cells of the genital tract. Shortly after entry, EBs transition into metabolically active reticulate bodies (RBs) that replicate within a membrane-bound bound pathogenic vacuole termed an “inclusion” (8Abdelrahman Y.M. Belland R.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Midway through the infectious cycle, replication becomes asynchronous, with some RBs transitioning back to the infectious EB stage (8Abdelrahman Y.M. Belland R.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Eventually, EBs are released into the extracellular space to initiate subsequent rounds of infection in adjacent cells. The entire infectious lifecycle is complete within 48–72h, depending on the C. trachomatis serovar. Throughout infection, Chlamydia translocates a diverse cohort of proteins into host membranes and cytoplasm to re-program membrane dynamics, protein transport, and cell signaling (9Valdivia R.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In canonical RAS signaling, growth factors bind to receptor-tyrosine kinases, leading to their dimerization and activation (10Downward J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues on these receptors recruit adaptor proteins and RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Upon binding GTP, RAS undergoes a conformational switch that allows the binding and activation of downstream effectors via RAS-binding domains (RBD) (11Donovan S. Shannon K.M. Bollag G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 23-45PubMed Google Scholar). There are three main classes of RAS effectors: RAF kinases, PI(3)P-dependent kinases and a diverse family of proteins that regulate cytoskeletal organization and membrane dynamics (12Schubbert S. Shannon K. Bollag G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Activated RAF phosphorylates dual specificity MAPK/ERK (MEK) kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. ERK phoshorylates transcription factors and other proteins (e.g. ribosomal protein kinases (RSK) and MAPK-interacting kinases (MNK)) that control cell growth and proliferation (10Downward J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells infected with Chlamydia display sustained activation of RAS and many of its downstream effectors including the PI3P-dependent kinase AKT and components of the MEK/ERK MAPK signaling module (5Su H. McClarty G. Dong F. Hatch G.M. Pan Z.K. Zhong G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9409-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Verbeke P. Welter-Stahl L. Ying S. Hansen J. Häcker G. Darville T. Ojcius D.M. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The activation of both AKT and ERK enhance Chlamydia survival by protecting infected cells from apoptosis (4Rajalingam K. Sharma M. Lohmann C. Oswald M. Thieck O. Froelich C.J. Rudel T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Verbeke P. Welter-Stahl L. Ying S. Hansen J. Häcker G. Darville T. Ojcius D.M. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For example, ERK-dependent expression of Mcl-1 protects infected cells from apoptotic signal delivered by innate immune mediators early in infection (4Rajalingam K. Sharma M. Lohmann C. Oswald M. Thieck O. Froelich C.J. Rudel T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One prominent target of ERK1/2 is the calcium-dependent cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) which removes the acyl chain at the sn2 position of glycerophospholipids to generate a lysophospholipid and a free fatty acid (14Ghosh M. Tucker D.E. Burchett S.A. Leslie C.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 487-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Lysophospholipids are readily transported to the inclusion, re-acylated with Chlamydia-derived branched fatty acids and incorporated into bacterial membranes (15Wylie J.L. Hatch G.M. McClarty G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7233-7242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because calcium chelators and specific inhibitors of cPLA2 significantly impair chlamydial replication and inhibit the transport of host-derived glycerophospholipids, it has been postulated that a host PLA2 activity is co-opted by Chlamydia to generate lipid precursors important for bacterial replication (5Su H. McClarty G. Dong F. Hatch G.M. Pan Z.K. Zhong G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9409-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, cPLA2-mediated changes in the lysophospholipid content of the lipid bilayer can modulate membrane transport by influencing the curvature of phospholipid bilayers and the formation of membrane tubules (16Brown W.J. Chambers K. Doody A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) from endosomes and Golgi apparatus (17San Pietro E. Capestrano M. Polishchuk E.V. DiPentima A. Trucco A. Zizza P. Mariggiò S. Pulvirenti T. Sallese M. Tete S. Mironov A.A. Leslie C.C. Corda D. Luini A. Polishchuk R.S. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), both membrane transport events important for chlamydial replication (18Carabeo R.A. Mead D.J. Hackstadt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6771-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Robertson D.K. Gu L. Rowe R.K. Beatty W.L. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000664Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Finally, activation of cPLA2 leads to pro-inflammatory responses, as its free fatty acid byproduct arachidonate is a substrate for lipoxygenases and prostaglandin generating enzymes (20Wymann M.P. Schneiter R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 162-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). These observations combined suggest a prominent and central role for cPLA2 in chlamydial pathogenesis. Chlamydia, like other bacterial pathogens, has evolved mechanisms to modulate signaling events to enhance their own replication and dissemination (21Betts H.J. Wolf K. Fields K.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Saka H.A. Valdivia R.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The observed activation of RAS signaling components in Chlamydia-infected cells and their apparent requirement for optimal bacterial replication has led to a model wherein activation of canonical RAS signaling may be important for bacterial survival and initiation of inflammatory responses (2Buchholz K.R. Stephens R.S. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Rajalingam K. Sharma M. Lohmann C. Oswald M. Thieck O. Froelich C.J. Rudel T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Su H. McClarty G. Dong F. Hatch G.M. Pan Z.K. Zhong G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9409-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, very recent evidence suggests that RAS may not be responsible for ERK activation (23Gurumurthy R.K. Maurer A.P. Machuy N. Hess S. Pleissner K.P. Schuchhardt J. Rudel T. Meyer T.F. Sci. Signal. 2010; 113: ra21Google Scholar). In this study we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that confirms that components of the RAS signaling pathway are independently activated indicating that RAS and ERK signaling in response to chlamydial infection are uncoupled. Furthermore, we determined that in murine cells cPLA2, a downstream effector of ERK signaling, regulates cell autonomous innate immune responses by modulating the expression of type I interferons specifically in response to C. trachomatis infections. HeLa and 293T cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). HEK-tTH cells were derived as described in Ref. 24O'Hayer K.M. Counter C.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. MEFs from cPLA2−/− knock-out mice were obtained from J. Bonaventre (Harvard Medical School) and have been previously described (25Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R. O'Leary E. Li E. Moskowitz M.A. Sapirstein A. Nature. 1997; 390: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Primary embryonic kidney cell lines were immortalized as previously described (24O'Hayer K.M. Counter C.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). C. trachomatis serovar LGV-L2 was propagated and stored as described in Ref. 26Caldwell H.D. Kromhout J. Schachter J. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 1161-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Chlamydia muridarum was obtained from H. Caldwell (Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIH). For infections, EBs were diluted in complete cell culture media and added to appropriate cells at an MOI of 1 and centrifuged at 1600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. For experiments using chemical inhibitors, the medium was replaced 30 min after infection with media containing the appropriate inhibitor after which the infection was allowed to proceed for prescribed times. Other reagents: EGF (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 1–10 ng/ml for 5 min. IFN-γ 100 units/ml (Calbiochem 407303) and IFN-β (Calbiochem 407298) 100 units/ml were used for 5 h to overnight. The MEK 1/2 inhibitor U0126 (Cell Signaling Technologies 9903) was used at a concentration of 10 μm. The cPLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3 (Calbiochem 100109) was used at a concentration of 50 μm unless otherwise stated. The farnesyl transferase inhibitor L-744,832 (Calbiochem 422720) was used at a concentration of 10 μm. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem 559389) was used at a concentration of 20 μm. All inhibitors were diluted in DMSO. 293T cells seeded in 10 cm plates for both lenti- and retrovirus production. For retroviral production, the pBabe retroviral system was used (27Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) and used as outlined in O'Hayer and Counter (24O'Hayer K.M. Counter C.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, packaging plasmid (pCL-10A1) and transfer vector (pBabe) were transfected in a 1:1 ratio using Fugene6 (Roche) into 293T cells. The media was collected 40 h post-transfection, filtered with 0.44 μm filters (Whatman), supplemented with Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide) (Sigma) at a concentration of 4 mg/ml and placed directly onto target cells. For lentivirus production (28Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cPLA2 specific shRNA plasmid (Open Biosystems) was transfected with packaging plasmid (pCMV-dR8.74) and envelope protein pMD2.G (Micah Luftig, Duke University) into 293T cells. Virus-containing medium was collected 48 h post-transfection. Stable transductants were selected with puromycin 1–2 μg/ml 24 h post-infection. RBD-EGFP-cDNA5 and H-RAS(wt)- cDNA5 expression plasmids were obtained from Mark Phillips, laboratory (NYU). H-RAS17N was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with QuikChange (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA5-EGFP was generated in our laboratory. For transient transfections, cells were seeded at 50–70% confluence and treated with FugeneHD (Roche)- DNA complexes as indicated by the manufacturer. Cells were analyzed 24 h post-transfection unless otherwise noted. Cell lysates were collected in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and aprotinin (1%). Levels of GTP-bound RAS were assessed by incubating cell lysates with glutathione-agarose beads (29de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) bound to GST-tagged RAS binding domain of RAF (GST-RBD) for 45 min at 4 °C. Lysates were washed in lysis buffer and bound proteins were solublized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Bound RAS-GTP was detected by Western blot with a pan-RAS or isoform-specific anti-RAS antibodies. Cells were fixed using either methanol or formaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibody staining at appropriate concentration was conducted at 4 °C for 1 h and followed by staining using fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. DNA was labeled using either Hoechst or Topro (Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 1:10,000 or 1:1,000, respectively. Cells were mounted to slides using mounting media (Invitrogen) and were stored at 4 °C, prior to analysis by Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy on a LEICA. Protein lysates were generated from tissue cultures cells in freshly made cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche), 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) for immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used: Pan-RAS (Oncogene Ab-4), H-RAS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-520), K-RAS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-30), N-RAS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-31). ERK 1/2 (9102), phospho-Erk 1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (9154), C-RAF (9422), phospho-c-RAF (Ser-338) (9427), cPLA2 (2832), phospho-cPLA2 (Ser-505) (2831), COX2 (4892), phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) (9211), and phospho-MEK (Ser-217/221) (9121) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Boston, MA). Anti-tubulin (B-5-1-2) and GAPDH (9483) antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Abcam, respectively. Anti-Irgm1, Irgm3, and Irgb6 have been previously described (30Collazo C.M. Yap G.S.

Tang, UC Irvine) and IncA antibodies (33Bannantine J.P. Stamm W.E. Suchland R.J. Rockey D.D. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 6017-6021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to monitor Chlamydia replication. Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. Infections were conducted in quadruplicate as described above at MOI <1. At 40 h, postinfection cells were lysed in SPG (sucrose-phosphate-glutamate) buffer by sonication. Serial dilutions were used to infect HeLa monolayers for 24 h. Cells were fixed with methanol and immunostained with anti-LGV-L2 antisera (P. Bavoil, University of Maryland) or anti-chlamydial LPS (H. Caldwell, RML/NIH). The number of inclusions per infection condition was determined with a Cellomics High Content Screening System (Thermo Scientific). Total RNA was collected from MEFs using Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Qiagen 74106). RNA (100 μg) from each sample was treated with Ambion DNA-free DNase kit (Ambion 1906) and cDNA generated using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Relative transcript abundances were assessed by PCR using ChoiceTaq Blue Mastermix (Denville) with the following oligonucleotide primers: GAPHDH: 5′-AGG TCG GTG TGA ACG GAT TTG-3′ and 5′-TGT AGA CCA TGT AGT TGA GGT CA-3′; IFN-β: 5′-CAG CTC CAA GAA AGG ACG AAC-3′ and 5′-GGC AGT GTA ACT CTT CTG CAT-3′. Lentiviruses containing and ISRE-luciferase reporter construct (SABioscience) were used to create stable cell lines that express luciferase in response to IFN via STAT1/STAT2 transcription factor. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and infected with LGV-L2 for 24 h or stimulated by transfection of 8 μg of poly(I):poly(C) (Sigma P9043) for 6 h or IFN-γ treatment. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates were collected, and luciferase activity assessed with firefly luciferase (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. C. trachomatis infection leads to the sustained activation of RAS and its downstream effectors (2Buchholz K.R. Stephens R.S. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Rajalingam K. Sharma M. Lohmann C. Oswald M. Thieck O. Froelich C.J. Rudel T.

PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As a result, it has been proposed that a canonical RAS signaling pathway is engaged during infection (5Su H. McClarty G. Dong F. Hatch G.M. Pan Z.K. Zhong G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9409-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We tested this model by following the activation of selected components of the RAS signaling pathway in Chlamydia-infected cells. We first assessed levels of active RAS-GTP in cell lysates by co-precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose beads after incubation with recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the RAS-GTP binding domain of RAF (RAFRBD). As previously reported (4Rajalingam K. Sharma M. Lohmann C. Oswald M. Thieck O. Froelich C.J. Rudel T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Su H. McClarty G. Dong F. Hatch G.M. Pan Z.K. Zhong G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9409-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we observed a significant accumulation of GTP-loaded RAS in HeLa cells during the exponential growth phase of C. trachomatis serovar LGV-L2 at 24 and 36 h postinfection (Fig. 1A and not shown). Because different isoforms of RAS can differ in both their ability to activate effectors (34Voice J.K. Klemke R.L. Le A. Jackson J.H. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2006; 24: 771-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), we next determined which RAS isoforms were activated. GTP-bound RAS was isolated from infected and uninfected HeLa lysates and H-RAS, N-RAS, and K-RAS were identified by immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies. All major RAS isoforms were activated, suggesting a broad engagement of RAS signaling during the replicative phase of infection (Fig. 1A). Next, we addressed if RAS was activated within specific subcellular compartments by monitoring the localization of RAFRBD-EGFP in infected cells (37Bivona T.G. Quatela S. Philips M.R.

In uninfected cells treated with EGF or serum, RAS-GTP pools were observed at the plasma membrane, the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum. This activation pattern was largely unchanged in infected cells (Fig. 1B). We did not observe a distinct recruitment of active RAS to the inclusion membrane as has been described for other small GTPases like RhoA and Rabs (38Kumar Y. Valdivia R.H.

It is unclear if this pool represents ER and Golgi, which envelope the inclusion (41Heuer D. Rejman Lipinski A. Machuy N. Karlas A. Wehrens A. Siedler F. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F.

Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or preferential RAS activation at these sites. We tested if RAS activation also occurred in a genetically defined, recently immortalized cell line. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were immortalized by retroviral delivery of SV40 large and small T-antigen (T/t), and the catalytic domain of human telomerase (hTert), (24O'Hayer K.M. Counter C.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and tested for the activation of RAS during infection. As with HeLa cells, infection of HEK-t/TH cells led to increases in RAS-GTP and phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the activation of RAS and ERK in Chlamydia-infected cells infection is not an artifact of the highly transformed status of HeLa cells. In canonical RAS signaling, the activation of downstream components is dependent on RAS. We first determined the kinetics of how this signaling circuitry is engaged in Chlamydia-infected cells by monitoring the accumulation of activated forms of RAF1, MEK, ERK1/2, and cPLA2 by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the activated forms of these signaling proteins. As previously reported (5Su H. McClarty G. Dong F. Hatch G.M. Pan Z.K. Zhong G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9409-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), infected cells displayed increasing levels of phosphorylated RAF, MEK, ERK1/2, and cPLA2, indicating sustained engagement of this signaling branch (Fig. 1D). However, while phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2 increased throughout infection, the accumulation of active forms of RAF peaked at 12 h and then dropped abruptly. Phosphorylated forms of cPLA2 peaked at 24 h but did not increase significantly after that (Fig. 1D). This potential discrepancy in the kinetics and magnitude with which activate forms of RAF, cPLA2, and MEK/ERK accumulated, led us to postulate that the activation of individual components of this signaling pathway may not be linked during infection. To determine if RAS signaling was required for ERK activation during infection, we manipulated RAS function by two methods. First, we used a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) to broadly inhibit the farnesylation and membrane anchoring of H-RAS (43Roberts P.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3291-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar), the primary RAS isoform present in HEK cells. FTI effectively inhibited RAS activation in HEK-t/TH cells, as assessed by the decreased efficiency of ERK phosphorylation in response to serum growth factors (Fig. 2A). Next, we tested if FTI-treatment prevented ERK activation during Chlamydia infection. FTI-treated infected HEK-t/TH cells had higher levels of phospho-ERK than uninfected cells, suggesting that ERK was activated despite the absence of proper RAS signaling (Fig. 2A). Treatment with FTI did not affect bacterial entry or replication (data not shown), indicating that any"

https://openalex.org/W2046232834,"Signaling through Ras GTPases controls the activity of many transcription factors including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ), which regulates oncogenic H-Ras<sup>V12</sup>-induced senescence and growth arrest. Here we report that C/EBPβ (LAP) DNA binding is inhibited by N-terminal sequences and derepressed by oncogenic Ras signaling. Sequence and mutational analyses showed that auto-repression involves two L<i>XX</i>LF (φ<i>XX</i>φφ)-like motifs (LX1 and LX2) and a third element, auto-inhibitory domain (AID), located within conserved region CR5. LX1 is a critical component of the transactivation domain and has been shown to mediate C/EBPβ binding to the TAZ2 region of p300/CREB-binding protein coactivators. C/EBPβ auto-repression also involves a C-terminal regulatory domain (CRD) adjacent to the leucine zipper. CRD contains a third φ<i>XX</i>φφ motif (LX3) and a short sequence, KQL, which has similarity to a region in the protein-binding site of TAZ2. The C/EBPβ N- and C-terminal domains physically associate in a manner that requires the basic region and CRD. We propose a model in which the regulatory sequences form a hydrophobic core that reciprocally inhibits DNA binding and transactivation. We also suggest a mechanism for C/EBPβ derepression involving several recently identified modifications within AID and CRD. Finally, we show that association of activated C/EBPβ with p300/CREB-binding protein requires the LX2 and AID auto-inhibitory elements. Thus, the N-terminal regulatory elements have dual roles in auto-inhibition and coactivator binding."

In rats receiving a high-fat diet (HFD), we analyzed the effects of a 4-wk administration of a novel functional analog of iodothyronines, TRC150094 (TRC). HFD-TRC rats exhibited increased energy expenditure (+24% vs. HFD rats; P<0.05) and body weight (BW) gain comparable to that of standard chow-fed (N) rats [N, HFD, and HFD-TRC rats, +97 g, +140 g (P<0.05 vs. N), and +98 g (P<0.05 vs. HFD)]. HFD-TRC rats had significantly less visceral adipose tissue (vs. HFD rats) and exhibited altered metabolism in two major tissues that are very active metabolically. In liver, mitochondrial fatty acid import and oxidation were increased (+56 and +32%, respectively; P<0.05 vs. HFD rats), and consequently the hepatic triglyceride content was lower (-35%; P<0.05 vs. HFD rats). These effects were independent of the AMP-activated protein kinase-acetyl CoA-carboxylase-malonyl CoA pathway but involved sirtuin 1 activation. In skeletal muscle, TRC induced a fiber shift toward the oxidative type in tibialis anterior muscle, increasing its capacity to oxidize fatty acids. HFD-TRC rats had lower (vs. HFD rats) plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. If reproduced in humans, these results will open interesting possibilities regarding the counteraction of metabolic dysfunction associated with ectopic/visceral fat accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2052365021,"Proteolytic modification of pattern recognition receptors and their signaling adaptor molecules has recently emerged as an essential cellular event to regulate immune and inflammatory responses. Here we show that the TIR domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF), an adaptor molecule mediating TLR3 signaling and MyD88-independent signaling of TLR4, plays an inhibitory role in TLR5-elicited responses by inducing proteolytic degradation of TLR5. TRIF overexpression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and human colonic epithelial (NCM460) cells abolishes the cellular protein level of TLR5, whereas it does not alter TLR5 mRNA level. Thus, TRIF overexpression dramatically suppresses flagellin/TLR5-deriven NFkappaB activation in NCM460 cells. TRIF-induced TLR5 protein degradation is completely inhibited in the presence of pan-caspase inhibitor (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone), whereas several specific inhibitors against cathepsin B, reactive oxygen species, or ubiquitin-mediated proteasome activity fail to suppress this degradation. These results indicate that TRIF-induced caspase activity causes TLR5 protein degradation. In addition, we identify that the C terminus of TRIF and extracellular domain of TLR5 are required for TRIF-induced TLR5 degradation. Furthermore, TRIF-induced proteolytic degradation is extended to TLR3, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, and TLR10, whereas the cellular level of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4 is not affected by TRIF overexpression. These results suggest that, in addition to mediating TLR3- or TLR4-induced signaling as an adaptor molecule, TRIF can participate in proteolytic modification of certain members of TLRs to modulate the functionality of TLRs at post-translational level. Collectively, our findings propose a potential inhibitory role of TRIF at least in regulating host-microbial communication via TLR5 in colonic epithelial cells."

Historically, these defensive strategies have been separated into two broad categories: viral restriction and viral extinction (Niwa et al., 1983Niwa O. Yokota Y. Ishida H. Sugahara T.

Cells of embryonic origin are unique in their capacity to silence retroviruses, which is understandable given the necessity of preventing insertional mutagenesis that could arise from retroviral reactivation. γ-retroviruses, like the mouse leukemia virus (MLV), can integrate into embryonic carcinoma and embryonic stem cells but are silenced by both restriction- and extinction-based mechanisms (Loh et al., 1990Loh T.P.

The early embryo possesses three stem cell lineages: embryonic stem (ES), trophectoderm stem (TS), and extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) stem cells that give rise to the embryo proper, placenta, and yolk sac, respectively. Although viral extinction has been well documented in cells of embryonic origin, the capacity of extraembryonic stem cells to epigenetically silence γ-retroviruses has not been examined. Given the distinct epigenetic mechanisms regulating X chromosome inactivation in embryonic and extraembryonic cells (Kunath et al., 2005Kunath T. Arnaud D. Uy G.D. Okamoto I. Chureau C. Yamanaka Y.

Preferential inactivation of the paternally derived X chromosome in the extraembryonic membranes of the mouse.Nature. 1975; 256: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that different modes of viral extinction may also exist between separate lineages of the preimplantation embryo. Specifically, we sought to determine whether stem cells derived from trophoblast and extraembryonic endoderm could epigenetically extinguish a MLV variant modified to escape retroviral restriction but which is susceptible to extinction (Cherry et al., 2000Cherry S.R. Biniszkiewicz D. van Parijs L. Baltimore D. Jaenisch R. Retroviral expression in embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7419-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, Grez et al., 1990Grez M. Akgün E. Hilberg F. Ostertag W.

Host cis-mediated extinction of a retrovirus permissive for expression in embryonal stem cells during differentiation.J. Virol. 1998; 72: 339-348PubMed Google Scholar). To examine viral extinction in stem cells, we assayed transcriptional activity of genetically marked mouse γ-retroviruses in primary ESCs, TSCs, and XEN stem cells. Unlike ESCs, TSCs did not silence proviral transcription but rather maintained consistent and high expression levels over long-term culture. Surprisingly, integration of γ-retrovirus into XEN cells produced rapid transcriptional silencing, by comparison to ESCs. We present data that indicate XEN cell extinction is epigenetic in nature and mediated by multiple chromatin remodeling and polycomb repressor complexes. These complexes not only act to modulate the silent state of integrated retroviruses but also play significant roles in repressing endogenous retro-element transcription. Furthermore, our results suggest that these repressor complexes are recruited to sites of viral integration through interactions with the Argonaute family of proteins. For decades, scientists have intensively studied mechanisms of gene regulation in ESCs, including those involved in exogenous and endogenous retroviral silencing. However, only a few epigenetic factors employed in retroviral silencing have been identified. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms operating in cohabiting extraembryonic stem cells have been virtually ignored, the assumption being that all stem cells utilize similar mechanisms. To determine whether stem cells derived from trophoblast and extraembryonic endoderm possess similar or distinct capacities to silence retroviruses, we chose to examine transcriptional activity of a MLV variant that is closely related to the endogenous type C retroviral element. To achieve this, we constructed a series of genetically marked mouse embryonic stem cell viruses (MSCV) (Figures 1A and 2A) and assayed their transcriptional activity in infected primary ESCs, TSCs, and XEN cells. Within 24 hr of infection, expression of virally delivered GFP could be detected within each of the three stem cell lineages (Figure 1B; Table S1 available online). To assay for viral extinction, cells were propagated for 6–15 weeks, with the percentage of GFP-positive cells monitored via flow cytometry at each passage (Figure 1C). Consistent with previous observations (Cherry et al., 2000Cherry S.R. Biniszkiewicz D. van Parijs L. Baltimore D. Jaenisch R. Retroviral expression in embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7419-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), ESCs exhibited a progressive decline in the number of cells expressing GFP with near complete viral extinction occurring after 15 weeks in culture (passage 40) (Figure S1). Surprisingly, TSCs did not inactivate the γ-retroviral reporter but rather maintained a constant level of GFP-expressing cells. This trend was maintained through 12 weeks of observation (30 passages) and correlated with continued expression of TSC-specific markers (data not shown). By comparison, XEN cells exhibited aggressive silencing of viral transcription such that within 3 weeks (6–7 passages), GFP expression was virtually undetectable. Given the surprising speed with which the γ-retroviral reporter was silenced in the XEN cell lineage, we examined viral extinction in this relatively uncharacterized cell type. To ensure that the observed extinction was an epigenetic phenomenon, and not an artifact of cellular differentiation or GFP toxicity, three experiments were conducted. First, to determine whether loss of viral expression was a result of cellular differentiation, RNA was extracted from MSCV-GFP-infected XEN cells at passages 2, 7, and 10 and assayed for expression of XEN cell markers. Abundant expression of transcripts encoding GATA binding protein 4 (Gata4), Forkhead box protein A2 (Foxa2), Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4), and Sex determining region Y-box 7 (Sox7) was observed via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Figure S1; Kunath et al., 2005Kunath T. Arnaud D. Uy G.D. Okamoto I. Chureau C. Yamanaka Y. Heard E. Gardner R.L. Avner P. Rossant J. Imprinted X-inactivation in extra-embryonic endoderm cell lines from mouse blastocysts.Development. 2005; 132: 1649-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Maintenance of XEN cell marker expression, together with consistent XEN cell morphology throughout the culture period, indicated that silencing of virally delivered GFP was not associated with loss of stemness. Second, to ensure that the observed extinction was not due to loss of integrated virus, nor to GFP toxicity, infected XEN cell DNA was examined for MSCV-GFP provirus at passage 2 through 10 by quantitative PCR (qPCR). No difference in the ratio of GFP to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) promoter amplification was detected throughout the experiment, indicating that the number of cells containing the integrated provirus was relatively unchanged (Figure S1). Finally, to determine whether viral reporter silencing was epigenetic in nature, pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation was employed. To this end, XEN cells were again infected with MSCV-GFP, cultured for 10 passages to allow γ-retroviral reporter silencing, then treated with 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) or trichostatin-A (TSA) either alone or in combination. Treatment with 5-Aza or TSA alone induced a 5- to 15-fold increase in reactivation of proviral transcription compared to vehicle alone. Treatment with both drugs produced a synergistic response leading to transcriptional activation (Figure 1D). Thus, integration of γ-retrovirus into the XEN cell genome rapidly initiated an aggressive epigenetic-based antiviral response, resulting in complete silencing of proviral transcription. To identify specific biochemical factors that mediate this epigenetic response, we conducted a loss-of-function, RNA interference (RNAi), positive selection screen. By sing a microRNA-based short hairpin RNA library (shRNAmir) (Silva et al., 2005Silva J.M. Li M.Z. Chang K. Ge W. Golding M.C. Rickles R.J. Siolas D. Hu G. Paddison P.J. Schlabach M.R. et al.Second-generation shRNA libraries covering the mouse and human genomes.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) that was designed to target 250 known protein-coding genes involved in epigenetic gene regulation (∼3 shRNAmir/gene; Table S2), we addressed the question of how γ-retroviruses are silenced in mouse XEN cells. To conduct our screen, we designed two separate γ-retroviral reporters with distinct fluorescent and drug-selectable markers (Figure 2A ). These constructs were packaged into infectious retroviral particles and delivered into early-passage XEN cells. Cells were drug selected, withdrawn from drug selection, and passaged to allow for retroviral extinction. As previously observed, integrated virus was rapidly silenced (Figure S2). Additionally, cultures were verified for maintenance of stemness via XEN cell markers as described above (Figure S1). At passage 11, replication-deficient lentiviral particles (Figure 2B) were used to deliver the shRNAmir epigenetic library into XEN cells containing a silenced γ-retroviral reporter. These constructs were specifically designed to facilitate delivery into ESCs, TSCs, and XEN cells (unpublished data). shRNAmir constructs were matched to contain distinct fluorescent and drug selection markers from the γ-retroviral reporters (Figure 2C). As a control, a shRNAmir targeting the firefly luciferase (Luc) gene was stably transduced into XEN cells, and experiments were conducted in parallel. Upon delivery of the shRNAmir library, cells were passaged for 1 week, then drug selected with either neomycin or puromycin to enrich for XEN cells with reactivated MSCV ChIN or MSCV PIG reporters, respectively. Surviving colonies were picked and DNA isolated, and perspective shRNAmirs conferring resistance to silencing were amplified and sequenced (425 colonies in total). Results of the screen based on a comprehensive scoring system (Figure S3) are summarized in Table 1. Three of the top 25 identified factors have known interactions with viral elements, which validates our experimental design: SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 5 (SMARCA5); DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1); and Helicase, lymphoid-specific (HELLS) (Chong et al., 2007Chong S.

In contrast, the majority of the candidates identified in this screen are novel regulators of retroviral silencing.Table 1Top 25 Candidate Genes Mediating γ-Retroviral Silencing in XEN CellsGene NameOther NamesScoreComplex AssociationSmarca1Snf2L, Nurf140637NURFSmarca5Snf2h, MommeD4349PRC1, SIN3a-HDAC, SNF2h-COHESIN-NuRD CENHdac7a201SIN3-HDACHdac2Rpd3, Yaf1, Yyibp180PRC2, SIN3a, NcORHdac9Hdac7b, Hdrp, Mitr135?Pcgf6Mblr, Rnf134108PRC1Smarcc2Baf17099BRG, BAFDnmt3a90PRC2, PRC3Eif2c1Ago180RISCEed77PRC2, PRC3, PRC4Myst4Morf, Moz2, Kat6b, Qkf63?Smarcd1Baf60a36BRG, BAFSmarcad1Etl131?Sfmbt224PHO-RCPhc2Mph2, Edr224PRC1SirT1Sir2, Sir2alpha24PRC4Myst2Hbo1, Hboa, Kat721?Smyd3Zmynd121?Dnmt1MommeD219PRC2, PRC3HellsLsh, Smarca6, Yfk8, Pasg18DNMTs / HMTsSuv39h1Kmt1a16PRC1, PRC2Myst1Mof, Kat816PRC1?Ezh2Enx-1, Kmt614PRC2, PRC3, PRC4Phc3Hph3, Edr39PRC1Actl6bActl6, Baf53b, ArpNa8BAF Open table in a new tab To validate the most promising candidates that emerged from our screen, shRNAmirs targeting the top ten candidates based on our scoring system were reintroduced into XEN cells. Target mRNA depletion was verified with a combination of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis (Figures S4 and S5). As controls, candidate shRNAmir-targeted XEN cells were compared to wild-type XEN cells, XEN cells infected with MSCV ChIN or MSCV PIG, as well as Luc shRNAmir-targeted XEN cells. For analysis, results were normalized to wild-type expression levels. All tested shRNAmirs produced target mRNA depletion. Our scoring system gives strong preference to genes for which multiple independent shRNAs emerged. Although arguably we may be bypassing strong candidates, it minimized the potential for off-target shRNAs to be included. The observation that shRNAmirs eliciting potent depletion scored higher in the screen then weaker ones validates the scoring system. To determine whether differences in proviral silencing between ESCs, TSCs, and XEN cells could be explained by a lineage-specific absence of candidate factors or differences in expression levels, relative transcript abundance was investigated via qRT-PCR analysis. To ensure accurate quantitation of candidate transcript levels between cell types, measurements were normalized against the geometric mean of β-actin, 7SK, and Hexokinase transcript levels. Very little SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 1 (Smarca1) expression was detected in TSCs; both ESCs and XEN cells possessed greater than 1000-fold higher transcript abundance than did TSCs (Figure 3). The remaining factors showed a 2- to 10-fold increase in transcript abundance in ESCs compared to TSCs and XEN cells, including SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 5 (Smarca5), Histone deactylases Hdac2, Hdac7, and Hdac9, Polycomb group ring finger 6 (Pcgf6), DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a), Argonaute1 (Ago1), and Embryonic ectoderm development (Eed). The lone exception was SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily c, member 2 (Smarcc2), which was 3 times more abundantly expressed in XEN cells than in ESCs or TSCs. Given that SMARCA5 was identified in a previous genetic screen for modifiers of retroviral gene silencing (Chong et al., 2007Chong S. Vickaryous N. Ashe A. Zamudio N. Youngson N. Hemley S. Stopka T. Skoultchi A. Matthews J. Scott H.S. et al.Modifiers of epigenetic reprogramming show paternal effects in the mouse.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that other gene family members (SMARCA1 and SMARCC2) may be involved in proviral suppression. Chromatin remodeling is associated with numerous heterogeneous protein complexes and diverse changes in chromatin structure, including histone deacetylation (Xue et al., 1998Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Côté J. Wang W. NURD, a novel complex with both ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling and histone deacetylase activities.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). To characterize histone acetylation changes associated with proviral silencing, we conducted quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of the MSCV 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) and proximal packaging region (Psi) (Figure 4A ) over the course of XEN cell viral extinction. A 1000-fold reduction in signal between passages 2 and 6 was observed when lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies recognizing histone 3 acetylation (H3Ac) (Figure 4B). This dramatic drop in acetylated histones strongly supports the involvement of histone deacetylases (HDAC2, HDAC7, and/or HDAC9) in proviral extinction. In further support of this data, Poleshko et al., 2008Poleshko A. Palagin I. Zhang R. Boimel P. Castagna C. Adams P.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A.

Virol. 2009; 83: 4749-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar identified a role for the class 1 histone deacetylases HDAC1-3 in suppressing retroviral transcription. Here, we have potentially expanded the family of HDACs involved in retroviral extinction to include both class 1 (HDAC2) and class 2 (HDAC7 and HDAC9) histone deacetylases. One interesting candidate to emerge from our screen is PCGF6. This protein, which was recently identified as a key component of the self-renewal process in ESCs (Hu et al., 2009Hu G. Kim J. Xu Q. Leng Y. Orkin S.H. Elledge S.J. A genome-wide RNAi screen identifies a new transcriptional module required for self-renewal.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), is a putative subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) (Lee et al., 2007Lee M.G. Norman J. Shilatifard A. Shiekhattar R.

PRC1 is a multimeric protein complex known to possess histone demethylating activity. Specifically, PCGF6 directly associates with members of the Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain (JARID) family of proteins, and thus the enzymatic removal of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) (Lee et al., 2007Lee M.G. Norman J. Shilatifard A. Shiekhattar R.

When lysates were precipitated with an antibody recognizing H3K4me3, a 60-fold reduction in signal was observed between passages 2 and 6 (Figure 4B). The third protein complex identified in our screen was PRC2, a repressive complex composed minimally of EED, Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and Suppressor of zeste 12 homolog (SUZ12) (Schwartz and Pirrotta, 2007Schwartz Y.B.

Cancer. 2006; 6: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Two of the three core components (EED and EZH2) were identified in our screen, strongly implicating this complex in proviral silencing. Furthermore, PRC2 interacts with suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1), HDAC2, and the DNMT family of proteins, all of which were identified in our screen. Through these interactions, PRC2 mediates transcriptional repression via histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation, as well as by directing DNA methylation (Cao et al., 2002Cao R.

To examine the role of PRC2 in viral extinction, we examined changes in H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) via ChIP. When lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies recognizing H3K9me3, a 300-fold increase in signal was detected between passages 2 and 6 (Figure 4B). By comparison, a slower, modest increase in H3K27me3 signal was observed over the experimental time course. PRC2 associates with all three members of the DNA methyltransferase family and directs DNA methylation of EZH2 target promoters (Viré et al., 2006Viré E. Brenner C. Deplus R. Blanchon L. Fraga M.

https://openalex.org/W2072522514,"PEA-15/PED (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 kDa/phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes) is a death effector domain-containing protein which is known to modulate apoptotic cell death. The mechanism by which PEA-15 inhibits caspase activation and increases ERK (extracellular-regulated kinase) activity is well characterized. Here, we demonstrate that PEA-15 is not only pivotal in the activation of the ERK pathway but also modulates JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) signaling. Upon overexpression of PEA-15 in malignant glioma cells, JNK is potently activated. The PEA-15-induced JNK activation depends on the phosphorylation of PEA-15 at both phosphorylation sites (serine 104 and serine 116). The activation of JNK is substantially inhibited by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of endogenous PEA-15. Moreover, we demonstrate that glioma cells overexpressing PEA-15 show increased signs of autophagy in response to classical autophagic stimuli such as ionizing irradiation, serum deprivation, or rapamycin treatment. In contrast, the non-phosphorylatable mutants of PEA-15 are not capable of promoting autophagy. The inhibition of JNK abrogates the PEA-15-mediated increase in autophagy. In conclusion, our data show that PEA-15 promotes autophagy in glioma cells in a JNK-dependent manner. This might render glioma cells more resistant to adverse stimuli such as starvation or ionizing irradiation.

Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The PEA-15 protein consists of an N-terminal nuclear export sequence, a death effector domain, an ERK binding site, and two phosphorylation sites (Ser-104 and Ser-116) at the C terminus. Unphosphorylated PEA-15 binds ERK1/2 and prevents its translocation into the nucleus, thereby reducing the ERK1/2-mediated transcriptional activity (3Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M.

Phosphorylation of PEA-15 at serine 104 prevents ERK1/2-binding and phosphorylation at serine 116 enhances the binding to Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase 8, resulting in the inhibition of apoptosis (2Renganathan H.

Because of its functional role in ERK signaling and apoptosis, the PEA-15 protein is involved in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, two key determinants of tumorigenesis (7Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). However, various studies reveal conflicting data on the functional role of PEA-15 in malignant tumors. PEA-15 mRNA is increased in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma compared with non-metastatic transformed cells (8Dong G. Loukinova E. Chen Z. Gangi L. Chanturita T.I. Liu E.T. Van Waes C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4797-4808PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of PEA-15 in a transgenic mouse model increases the susceptibility to chemically induced skin cancer (9Formisano P. Perruolo G. Libertini S. Santopietro S. Troncone G. Raciti G.A. Oriente F. Portella G. Miele C. Beguinot F. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7012-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown in an earlier study that PEA-15 expression is increased in glioblastomas, and that the PEA-15 protein mediates resistance to glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis in glioma cells in an ERK-dependent manner (10Eckert A. Böck B.C. Tagscherer K.E. Haas T.L. Grund K. Sykora J. Herold-Mende C. Ehemann V. Hollstein M. Chneiweiss H. Wiestler O.D. Walczak H. Roth W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that PEA-15 promotes tumor cell survival in a poor microenvironment. Controversially, the adenovirus protein E1 decreases tumorigenicity and proliferation in ovarian cancer cells via increased PEA-15 expression (11Bartholomeusz C. Itamochi H. Nitta M. Saya H. Ginsberg M.H. Ueno N.T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been reported that PEA-15 induces cell death by autophagy in ovarian cancer cells (12Bartholomeusz C. Rosen D. Wei C. Kazansky A. Yamasaki F. Takahashi T. Itamochi H. Kondo S. Liu J. Ueno N.T. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a dynamic cellular process in which intracellular membrane structures, the so-called autophagosomes, sequester proteins, and organelles for degradation (13Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). It is an evolutionary highly conserved process which occurs in all eukaryotic cells from yeast to human. Autophagy provides energy to cells during periods of starvation. On the other hand, autophagy has recently been defined as a distinct type of cell death (so-called type-II programmed cell death) (14Baehrecke E.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 15Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Curr. Top Dev. Biol. 2007; 78: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Autophagy starts by engulfing cytosol and/or organelles by double membrane-bound structures, known as autophagosomes. These autophagosomes finally fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes which mediate the subsequent degradation and recycling of the cellular components. Accumulating evidence argues for an important role of autophagy in the development of cancer (16Levine B. Nature. 2007; 446: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). However, whether autophagy exerts a protective or destructive effect on cancer cells remains controversial. Breast cancer cell lines frequently contain a deletion of the autophagy gene beclin 1 (17Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar), which is necessary to induce autophagy. An allelic deletion of chromosome 17q21 where beclin 1 is located is found in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer (18Eccles D.M. Cranston G. Steel C.M. Nakamura Y. Leonard R.C.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3382-3385PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mice with a heterozygous deletion of beclin 1 show increased incidence of lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lymphoma (23Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H. Troxel A. Rosen J. Eskelinen E.L. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Cattoretti G. Levine B. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar). One major regulatory mechanism of autophagy is the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway. In the presence of growth factors, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase (PI3K) is activated at the plasma membrane. This activation subsequently leads to the activation of mTor (mammalian target of rapamycin) and to the inhibition of autophagy. Upon starvation of the cells, this pathway is blocked and autophagy is induced via class 3 PI3K and Beclin 1. Several lines of evidence suggest that a cross-talk exists between the pathways leading to autophagy and apoptosis (14Baehrecke E.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Here, we describe that PEA-15, in addition to its ERK1/2-dependent anti-apoptotic function, is also involved in the regulation of autophagy in malignant glioma cells. We show that PEA-15 increases JNK activity and that JNK is required for the induction of autophagy. Promotion of autophagy might be another PEA-15-dependent protective mechanism which allows glioblastoma cells to survive under poor nutritional conditions. The JNK inhibitor SP600125, 3-methyladenine, bafilomycin A1, acridine orange, and the LC3 antibody were purchased from Sigma. The rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for PEA-15 was described previously (24Sharif A. Canton B. Junier M.P. Chneiweiss H. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2003; 1010: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The JNK1/3 antibody (c-17) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Heidelberg, Germany). The pJNK was purchased from Cell Signaling (Frankfurt a.M., Germany). siRNA (short interfering RNA) was ordered from Ambion (Austin, TX). The human glioma cell lines U87MG, U251MG, T98G, and LN18 were maintained in DMEM, high glucose (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Cölben, Germany), 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The colony formation assay was carried out as described elsewhere (10Eckert A. Böck B.C. Tagscherer K.E. Haas T.L. Grund K. Sykora J. Herold-Mende C. Ehemann V. Hollstein M. Chneiweiss H. Wiestler O.D. Walczak H. Roth W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing PEA-15 or PEA-15 variants were cultured in medium containing Geneticin® (G418) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cells were transfected by lipofection using Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Experiments using cells which transiently overexpress various plasmids were performed 18 h post-transfection if not indicated differently. The cells were transfected with the plasmids pcDNA3-neo (control), pcDNA3-FLAG-PEA-15, pcDNA3-FLAG-PEA- 15S104A, pcDNA3-FLAG-PEA-15S116A, pcDNA3-FLAG-PEA- 15S104/116A. Transient transfections with siRNA were carried out at a siRNA concentration of 50 nm. The following sequence was chosen to specifically target PEA-15 and Beclin 1, respectively: 5′-GCGAAAAGAGUGAGGAGAUtt-3′ (PEA- 15 sense); 5′-AUCUCCUCACUCUUUUCGCtt-3′ (PEA-15 antisense); 5′-CAGUUUGGCACAAUCAAUAtt-3′ (Beclin 1 sense); 5′-UAUUGAUUGUGCCAAACUGtt-3′ (Beclin 1 antisense). Cells transfected with scramble siRNA (scram) served as a control. The control siRNA had the following sequence: 5′-GAAGACGAAGAGUGAGGAUtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-AUCUCCACUCUCUGUUCUCtt-3′ (antisense). Cells were subjected to experiments 72 h post-transfection. The non-phosphorylatable variants of PEA-15 were generated as described previously (10Eckert A. Böck B.C. Tagscherer K.E. Haas T.L. Grund K. Sykora J. Herold-Mende C. Ehemann V. Hollstein M. Chneiweiss H. Wiestler O.D. Walczak H. Roth W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, to substitute the phosphorylation sites (Ser-104 and Ser-116) of PEA-15 by alanine, pcDNA3-PEA15 was used as a template using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). To substitute Ser-104 by an Ala, the primer 5′-AACCCGTATTCCCGCTGCCAAGAAGTACA-3′ and its reverse complement were used. To exchange Ser-116 for Ala, pcDNA3- PEA-15served as template using the primer 5′-ATTCCGGCAGCCCGCTGAAGAAGAAATCA-3′ and its reverse complement. To generate the double phosphomutant pcDNA3- FLAG-PEA-15S104/116A the sequence of pcDNA3-FLAG- PEA-15S104A served as a template using the primer 5′-ATTCCGGCAGCCCGCTGAAGAAGAAATCA-3′ and its reverse complement. For each step 13 PCR cycles were performed. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing (MWG, Martinsried, Germany). The FACS analysis of glioma cells after acridine orange staining was performed using a FACS-calibur from Becton & Dickinson equipped with a 488 nm air-cooled argon laser. The green (510–530 nm) and red (>650 nm) fluorescence emission of 104 cells was measured. For plot analysis, the Cell Quest software (Becton & Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was used. The cells were stained with 1 μg/ml acridine orange for 30 min in DMEM, high glucose lacking phenol red supplemented with 10% FCS. Post staining cells were washed in PBS and removed from the plate with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). If the cells were treated with inhibitors the staining was performed in the presence of the corresponding inhibitor. FACS analysis was performed in DMEM, high glucose lacking phenol red. To target the PEA-15 protein for down-regulation by siRNA, the pSUPER-PEA-15 construct and the pSUPER-siRNA-scram (control) were generated as described previously (10Eckert A. Böck B.C. Tagscherer K.E. Haas T.L. Grund K. Sykora J. Herold-Mende C. Ehemann V. Hollstein M. Chneiweiss H. Wiestler O.D. Walczak H. Roth W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, siRNA sequence including the H1 promotor was subcloned from the pSuper construct into the lentiviral expression vector pG-Lenti (kindly provided by Carol Stocking-Harbers, Hamburg, Germany), which expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the SFFV promoter. Amphotropic retroviral supernatants were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells with the retroviral packaging vectors pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV-Rev, and pMD-G and the corresponding siRNA construct. U87MG and U251MG cells were infected at least two times with retroviral supernatant. Positive clones were selected by GFP expression and verified by Western blot analysis. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of lysis buffer. Cells which were subjected to Western blot analysis were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS). The cells were sonicated 2 times at 95% power for 30 s. For lysates subjected to co-immunoprecipitation experiment or in in vitro kinase assays, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1,5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na4PPi, 100 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 10 min on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. The JNK C-17 antibody (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) directed against JNK1 and JNK3 was prebound to Protein G-Sepharose beads (50 ng/μl slurry) (Invitrogen) as described previously (25Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The clarified lysate was incubated with 20 μl of antibody-bound protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitates used for kinase assays were washed three times with HNTG buffer containing 1 m LiCl, three times with HNTG buffer, and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted using the antibodies indicated, followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Western blots were developed by chemiluminescence. Multiple exposures of the Western blots were developed. Kinase assays were performed in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). For the JNK assays, 8 μg of GST-c-Jun was used as the substrate, and the reaction was carried out for 20 min at room temperature. Independent experiments showed that the reaction was linear within this time range. The reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0,2% bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 mm EDTA (pH 8,0). The pGEX-c-Jun-(1–115) vector was kindly provided by Dr. Kathleen A. Gallo (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). GST-c-Jun was expressed in Top10 Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Invitrogen) chromatography. Following the kinase assay, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and incorporation of radioactivity into GST-c-Jun was determined by autoradiography. To analyze autophagolysosome formation by fluorescence microscopy cells were stained in DMEM, high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing 1 μg/ml acridine orange. The color change from green to red was monitored under the microscope at different time points as indicated. Cells were analyzed with an Olympus CKX41 microscope, ×20 objective lens, and ColorView I FW camera. The exposure time was 200 ms. Cell imaging software was used for the acquisition of microscopic images. Electron microscopy was performed to analyze autophagosome formation. Cells were fixed in situ with 2,3% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH, 7.2) for 30 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were scraped from the plates, collected by low-speed centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, successively stained with 2% osmium tetroxide and 0.5% uranyl acetate. After dehydration and embedding in Epru the probes were processed for ultrathin section. Micrographs were taken with a Zeiss EM-10A electron microscope at 80 kV. The magnification indicator was routinely controlled by the use of a grating replica. Although the pivotal role of PEA-15 in the ERK signaling pathway has been intensively studied, only little is known about the influence of PEA-15 on the stress-activated JNK pathway. We hypothesized that PEA-15 not only has the potential to regulate the physiological function of ERK1/2, but also impacts the JNK pathway in glioma cells. To investigate the effect of PEA-15 on JNK activity, PEA-15 was transiently and stably expressed in U251MG (Fig. 1A) and U87MG (Fig. 1B) cells, respectively. Endogenous JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using GST-c-Jun mimicking the endogenous substrate. These experiments showed that UV-induced JNK activity was substantially increased in PEA-15 overexpressing cells. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of endogenous PEA-15 strongly decreased JNK activity after UV (Fig. 1C) or γ-irradiation (Fig. 1D). A decrease in JNK activity in response to reduced PEA-15 levels was already observed in the absence of UV-induced JNK activation (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Taken together these results indicate that enhanced expression of PEA-15 increases JNK activity. PEA-15 is a phosphoprotein that contains two C-terminal phosphorylation sites, the seryl residues 104 and 116. We wondered whether phosphorylation of PEA-15 is required for PEA-15-induced JNK activity. First, we investigated if γ-irradiation increases PEA-15 phosphorylation. Glioma cells were subjected to γ-irradiation and PEA-15 phosphorylation was analyzed using an antibody directed against the phosphorylated serine 116 (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation of PEA-15 is still detected 24 h postirradiation. If phosphorylation of PEA-15 is required for JNK activity the inhibition of PEA-15 phosphorylation is supposed to decrease JNK activity. Therefore, we transiently (Fig. 2B) and stably (Fig. 2C) expressed various non-phosphorylatable PEA-15 mutants (PEA-15-S104A, PEA-15-S116A, PEA-15-S104/116A) in glioma cells. The experiments demonstrate that phosphorylation of both seryl residues is required for PEA-15-induced JNK activation. Because it was demonstrated that only non-phosphorylated PEA-15 is capable of binding ERK1/2 (3Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we examined if the interaction between PEA-15 and JNK also depends on the phosphorylation status of PEA-15. Thus, endogenous JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates and subjected to an in vitro immunocomplex assay. Interestingly, not only wild-type PEA-15 but all of the tested phosphovariants of PEA-15 were capable to interact with JNK (Fig. 2D). In contrast to γ-irradiation, activation of JNK by H2O2 or anisomycin was independent of PEA-15 expression (Fig. 2E). Accordingly, H2O2 and anisomycin did not induce phosphorylation of PEA-15 (not shown). Growing evidence suggests that standard treatment of glioblastomas with temozolomide in combination with γ-irradiation induces autophagy (27Ito H. Daido S. Kanzawa T. Kondo S. Kondo Y. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 26: 1401-1410PubMed Google Scholar, 28Daido S. Yamamoto A. Fujiwara K. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Kondo Y.

Neurosurg. 2003; 99: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To set up an experimental system for the investigation of autophagy, we first confirmed that γ-irradiated glioblastoma cells show classical signs of autophagy. An electron microscopy analysis of several γ-irradiated glioblastoma cell lines clearly showed the massive appearance of double membrane vesicles, the so-called autophagosomes, which engulf cytoplasm and cellular organelles (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we were interested in the long term outcome of glioma cells undergoing autophagy after γ-irradiation. Thus, we performed clonogenicity assays after γ-irradiation in the presence or absence of 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, and after down-regulation of Beclin1, a protein important in the induction of autophagy. These experiments demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy either by a chemical autophagy inhibitor or by down-regulation of Beclin1 results in a substantial decrease in the number of colonies, suggesting that autophagy plays rather a cytoprotective than a cell death-promoting role (Fig. 3B). Because there is increasing evidence for Beclin1-independent autophagy (31Scarlatti F. Maffei R. Beau I. Codogno P. Ghidoni R. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1318-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) we investigated the role of Beclin-1 in γ-irradiation-induced autophagy of glioblastoma cells. To this end, we transiently down-regulated Beclin 1 in U251MG cells. Cells that were exposed to γ-irradiation showed a significant decrease in the number of autophagic cells when Beclin 1 was down-regulated (Fig. 3C), suggesting that γ-irradiation-induced autophagy is dependent on the expression of Beclin 1. Given the known involvement of JNK in autophagy (32Cheng Y. Qiu F. Tashiro S. Onodera S. Ikejima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 376: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 33Cui Q. Tashiro S. Onodera S. Minami M. Ikejima T. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 105: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Wei Y. Pattingre S. Sinha S. Bassik M. Levine B. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 678-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) and our finding of PEA-15-dependent JNK activation, we investigated whether the PEA-15 protein affects autophagy in glioma cells. To this end, various glioma cell lines were labeled with acridine orange and subjected to FACS after γ-irradiation. In U87 and LN18 glioma cell lines an increase in the number of autophagic cells after γ-irradiation was observed (Fig. 4A). The induction of autophagy was at least partially blocked by incubating the cells with 3-methyladenine. This result confirmed that the observed process was indeed autophagy. Importantly, overexpression of PEA-15 increased the autophagic activity in various glioma cell lines after γ-irradiation. The PEA-15-induced augmentation of autophagy was partly abolished in the presence of 3-methyladenine. In general, autophagy increased in a dose-dependent manner between an irradiation dose of 5 and 20 Gy. A further increase up to 30 Gy did not further increase autophagy (Fig. 4B). Next, the PEA-15-dependent promotion of autophagy was confirmed by examining the LC3 protein by immunoblot analysis. LC3 (microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain), the mammalian homolog of Atg8, is a reliable marker of autophagosomes. During autophagosome formation, LC3-I undergoes a conversion to LC3-II. The amount of LC3-II correlates well with the number of autophagosomes (35Klionsky D.J. Cuervo A.M. Seglen P.O. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 181-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). First, the time course of LC3 conversion was examined in glioma cells upon γ-irradiation (Fig. 5A). U87MG glioma cells stably overexpressing PEA-15 showed a strong increase in LC3-II 6-h postirradiation. The absence of LC3-II 24-h postirradiation may be due to the fact that it is already degraded at this time point. Similarly, serum deprivation increased the amount of LC3-II in glioma cells (Fig. 5B). The increase of LC3-II was more sustained in the cells stably expressing PEA-15. To inhibit degradation of LC3 and to obtain an increased accumulation of the converted form after induction of autophagy bafilomycin A1 was used to stabilize LC3-II. In accordance with the previous experiments, the down-regulation of PEA-15 by small-interfering RNA resulted in a reduction of the LC3-II level (Fig. 5C). These results confirmed the data obtained by FACS analysis suggesting that PEA-15 increases autophagy in glioma cells. Various reports emphasize the crucial role of the two phosphorylation sites Ser-104 and Ser-116 for the function of the PEA-15 protein (2Renganathan H. Vaidyanathan H. Knapinska A. Ramos J.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the phosphorylation status of PEA-15 is important for the PEA-15-induced autophagy. Glioma cells transiently expressing various non-phosphorylatable PEA-15 mutants were exposed to γ-irradiation and, 18-h post-treatment, to acridine orange staining followed by FACS analysis. The experiments showed that abrogation of PEA-15 phosphorylation strongly diminished the number of autophagic cells (Fig. 5D). The autophagic activity in cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable mutants was even lower than in the neo control-transfected cells. From these data, we conclude that the phosphorylation of PEA-15 is required for its autophagy-promoting function. Although JNK is well known for its central role in the regulation of apop"
https://openalex.org/W1992843827,"Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG1, securin) is involved in cell-cycle control through inhibition of sister-chromatid separation. Elevated levels of PTTG1 were found to be associated with many different tumor types that might be involved in late stage tumor progression. However, the role of PTTG1 in early stage of tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we utilized the adenovirus expression system to deliver PTTG1 into normal human fibroblasts to evaluate the role of PTTG1 in tumorigenesis. Expressing PTTG1 in normal human fibroblasts inhibited cell proliferation. Several senescence-associated (SA) phenotypes including increased SA-β-galactosidase activities, decreased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and increased SA-heterochromatin foci formation were also observed in PTTG1-expressing cells, indicating that PTTG1 overexpression induced a senescent phenotype in normal cells. Significantly, the PTTG1-induced senescence is p53-dependent and telomerase-independent, which is distinctively different from that of replicative senescence. The mechanism of PTTG1-induced senescence was also analyzed. Consistent with its role in regulating sister-chromatid separation, overexpression of PTTG1 inhibited the activation of separase. Consequently, the numbers of cells with abnormal nuclei morphologies and chromosome separations were increased, which resulted in activation of the DNA damage response. Thus, we concluded that PTTG1 overexpression in normal human fibroblasts caused chromosome instability, which subsequently induced p53-dependent senescence through activation of DNA-damage response pathway.

Thus, we concluded that PTTG1 overexpression in normal human fibroblasts caused chromosome instability, which subsequently induced p53-dependent senescence through activation of DNA-damage response pathway. The pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG1 or human securin) was first identified from rat pituitary tumor cells (1.Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It was then found to be a securin that is involved in cell-cycle control through inhibiting sister-chromatid separation (2.Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). PTTG1 mRNA can be detected in adult testis, thymus, placenta, colon, small intestine, spleen, pancreas, brain, lung, and fetal liver (3.Domínguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Rios R.M. Dreyfus F. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4.Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentini A. Nakashima M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, PTTG1 protein levels are very low or undetectable in most normal human tissues. Notably, the expression of PTTG1 is elevated in many tumor types such as pituitary adenomas, primary epithelial neoplasms, and hemopoietic malignancies (for review, see Ref. 5.Vlotides G. Eigler T. Melmed S. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and is associated with metastasis and a poor clinical outcome with several types of tumors (6.Ramaswamy S. Ross K.N. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (2025) Google Scholar). Moreover, transfection of PTTG1 into NIH 3T3 cells results in anchorage-independent transformation in vitro and tumor formation in athymic nude mice (1.Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, PTTG1 has been implicated as a proto-oncogene that would seem to be involved in tumorigenesis. Increased PTTG1 levels cause mis-segregation of chromosomes and facilitate genome instability and thereby lead to cancer formation (7.Yu R. Lu W. Chen J. McCabe C.J. Melmed S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4991-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition to its function in mitosis, where the protein binds separase to control the onset of sister-chromatid separation, PTTG1 also affects tumorigenesis through various other mechanisms. First, PTTG1 protein is able to bind p53 to regulate apoptosis and its transcriptional activity in tumor cells (8.Bernal J.A. Luna R. Espina A. Lázaro I. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Arias C. Silva A. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Second, it might also interact with Ku protein, a regulatory subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, to modulate the double strand DNA damage response (9.Romero F. Multon M.C. Ramos-Morales F. Domínguez A. Bernal J.A. Pintor-Toro J.A. Tortolero M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1300-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) because it has been shown that the PTTG1-Ku interaction is disrupted upon DNA damage (9.Romero F. Multon M.C. Ramos-Morales F. Domínguez A. Bernal J.A. Pintor-Toro J.A. Tortolero M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1300-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Third, PTTG1 has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo to induce angiogenesis possibly through the induction of basic fibroblast growth factor secretion (4.Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentini A. Nakashima M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10.Ishikawa H. Heaney A.P. Yu R. Horwitz G.A. Melmed S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, PTTG1 seems to render its effects on tumorigenesis through a combination of diverse mechanisms. However, because most experiments have been conducted in cancer cells that already have significant levels of chromosome aberrations, this scenario does not fully explain the role of PTTG1 in tumorigenesis. Immortal cells tend to respond to DNA damage or oncogenes by undergoing apoptosis or neoplastic transformation. In contrast, normal human fibroblasts respond to DNA damage by adopting a phenotype that closely resembles replicative senescence (11.Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Thus, normal human cells differ remarkably from immortal cells in their response to potentially oncogenic stimuli. Although higher expression of PTTG1 is frequently observed in malignant tumors, the role of PTTG1 in human cancers has yet to be clearly defined. The question of how PTTG1 overexpression affects normal cells has not been addressed. To evaluate the role of PTTG1 in normal cells, we overexpressed PTTG1 in normal human fibroblasts and analyzed the cellular effects. Our results indicated that forced expression of PTTG1 inhibited the proliferation of normal human fibroblasts. This was accompanied by the induction of several senescence markers including senescence-associated acidic β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) 4The abbreviations used are: SA-β-galsenescence-associated acidic β-galactosidaseSAHFsenescence-associated heterochromatin focix-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosidem.o.i.multiplicity of infectionshRNAshort hairpin RNABrdUrdbromodeoxyuridinePBSphosphate-buffered salineGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. activity and the appearance of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) in these cells. This PTTG1-induced senescence is p53-dependent and telomerase-independent and is, thus, distinctively different from that of replicative senescence. It is similar to that of oncogene-induced senescence in that it serves as a failsafe mechanism to protect normal cells from transformation at the early stages of tumorigenesis. Thus, our results provide the first indication for the involvement of PTTG1 in the early stages of tumor formation. senescence-associated acidic β-galactosidase senescence-associated heterochromatin foci 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside multiplicity of infection short hairpin RNA bromodeoxyuridine phosphate-buffered saline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase green fluorescent protein 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Human primary normal lung fibroblast IMR90 and foreskin fibroblast BJ-1 were maintained in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Ad293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. BJ-hTERT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with Medium 199 (Invitrogen) at a 4:1 ratio with 10% fetal bovine serum. The AdEasyTM XL Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene) was used to generate recombinant adenoviruses. Approximately 50–70% confluence Ad293 cells were plated in 6-well plates for 24 h before transfection. PacI-digested recombinant adenoviral vector DNA (4 μg) was transfected into Ad293 cells using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). Viruses were collected 7–9 days after transfection. The viral lysates were freeze-thawed three times and then used to infect new Ad293 cells. After three rounds of infection, the viral titers were often high enough for later amplification. To generate higher titer viral stocks, viruses at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) equal to 10 were used to infect 5 × 108 packaging cells. After 30–40 h the resultant viruses were then purified using the CsCl banding technique. The titer of the adenoviruses ranged between 106 and 107 plaque-forming units/μl. All four lentiviral plasmids containing shRNA sequences against p53 were obtained from National RNAi core facility in Taiwan. The retroviral knockdown system was based on the RNAi Consortium (TRC) library pLKO.1 hairpin plasmid, the pCMV-ΔR8.91 packaging plasmid, and the pMD.G envelope plasmid (12.Escarpe P. Zayek N. Chin P. Borellini F. Zufferey R. Veres G. Kiermer V. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 332-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Lentiviral transductions were performed in 293T cells following the standard protocol. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 3–5 min in 3% formaldehyde, and then incubated with fresh SA-β-gal stain solution containing 1 mg/ml X-gal, 40 mm citric acid, sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 12–16 h. At least 250 cells were counted in randomly chosen fields for each sample. About 104 cells were plated in 12-well plates using glass slides and labeling with 100 μm BrdUrd for 4 h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by three washes using PBS. DNA within the cells were denatured on ice with 1 m HCl for 10 min, 2 m HCl at 25 °C for 10 min, and 2 m HCl at 37 °C for 20 min and then washed with PBS. Neutralization of the DNA was conducted using Tris borate-EDTA buffer, pH 8.4. The cells were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd (BU-33, Sigma) was then added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min. A solution containing 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetraanhydrochloride (0.16 mg/ml) and 0.3% H2O2 was then added and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Cells were also stained with hematoxylin solution. Plasmid pET6H-PTTG1, which was used to purify the recombinant PTTG1, was constructed by inserting the SmaI-SpeI fragment of pUC18-PTTG1 into SmaI-SpeI-digested pET6H (a gift from C.-H. Hu, National Marine University, Taipei, Taiwan). The resulting plasmid was used to express His6-tagged PTTG1 under the control of the T7 promoter. To purify His6-tagged PTTG1, a 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli harboring pET6H-PTTG1 was grown at 25 °C to an A600 of 0.5 and induced with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were grown at 25 °C for overnight before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1× protease inhibitors (Calbiochem)) and sonicated to release the cell contents. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain total cell free extracts. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) (0.5 ml) was added to the total cell-free extracts and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed and eluted with 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. Purified protein was separated into aliquots and frozen by a dry ice-ethanol bath. The yield of PTTG1 was 20 mg from 1 liter of E. coli culture. Polyclonal antibodies against PTTG1 were generated using a rabbit. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 1 mm EDTA) containing a standard mixture of protease inhibitors. After 30 min on ice, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Samples corresponding to 50–100 μg of protein (Bio-Rad protein assay) were separated on 8 or 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis was carried out according to standard procedures using ECL detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were hybridized with the following antibodies: anti-p53 (Ab2, Oncogene), anti-Rb (Ab5, Oncogene), anti-p21waf1 (Ab3, Calbiochem), anti-p16 (Ab1, Calbiochem), anti-phosphohistone H2AX (Ser-139, Upstate Biotechnology), anti-separase (ab3762, Abcam), and anti-phospho-Rb (phosphoserine 780, Sigma). Equivalent loading of lanes was verified by hybridization with anti-GAPDH and anti-actin antibodies (Calbiochem). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used as the secondary antibodies. The proliferative capacity of cells was monitored by seeding of 2 × 105 into 30-mm dish containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Adenovirus carrying GFP or PTTG1 was added the next day as described above. Cells were then digested with trypsin, stained with 0.2% trypan blue, and counted using a hemocytometer. Cell cycle analysis was performed by monitoring the DNA content at various time points by propidium iodide staining. Cells were fixed in 70% cold ethanol followed by washing with PBS. The cells were then incubated with 1 mg/ml RNase A and 2 μg/ml propidium iodide at 4 °C for 30 min and then analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). About 106 cells were acquired for analysis using Cell Quest software. Cells were grew on slides, rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100). Primary antibody, anti-phosphohistone H2AX (Ser-139, Upstate Biotechnology), or anti-trimethylhistone H3-Lys-9 (Upstate Biotechnology) was added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then washed and incubated with Rhodamine Red-X (RRX)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. The cells were also stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma, 1 μg/ml) for 5 min. The cells were visualized using fluorescence or confocal microscopy. Cells expressing GFP were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33258 and visualized directly.

To evaluate the role of PTTG1 in normal cells, we used an adenovirus delivery system to facilitate the expression of PTTG1 gene into normal fibroblasts. The percentages of adenoviral-transduced cells ranged from 60 to 90%, as estimated by parallel infection using adenovirus expressing the GFP gene. We have also expressed PTTG1 in E. coli and isolated recombinant PTTG1 protein to near homogeneity (supplemental Fig. S1A). The recombinant PTTG1 was then used to generate polyclonal antibodies from rabbit. Under our assay conditions, the generated antibodies successfully detect PTTG1 with high specificity in lung cancer H1299 cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). We were unable to detect PTTG1 in IMR90 and the two other normal human fibroblasts BJ1 and WI38 before transfection (supplemental Fig. S1C and data not shown). Using the adenovirus delivery system, we effectively introduced PTTG1 into IMR90 cells. The expression level of PTTG1 protein was increased in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S1C). An m.o.i. value equivalent to 20 was chosen for all subsequent experiments as this m.o.i. efficiently expressed PTTG1 or GFP without causing virus infective stress. At an m.o.i. equivalent to 20, the expression level of PTTG1 peaked at ∼3–4 days after infection and then quickly decreased in the IMR90 cells (supplemental Fig. S1C). Thus, our established delivery systems enabled efficient introduction of PTTG1 into normal fibroblasts. The cellular effects of forced PTTG1 expression were then evaluated in these infected normal fibroblasts. The proliferation potential of the normal cells upon PTTG1 expression was first examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, the cell number of PTTG1-expressing cells did not increase after infection, indicating that PTTG1 inhibited proliferation of normal cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the proportion of G1 cells was reduced in PTTG1-expressing cells (Fig. 1B). The G1 fraction was decreased from ∼67% in the control sample to ∼50% in PTTG1-expressed cells. PTTG1 expression also slightly increased the number of aneuploid cells. Intriguingly, although PTTG1 is involved in mitosis progression, the proportion of aneuploid cells was modestly but reproducibly (albeit statistically insignificant) increased upon expression of this protein. The cell cycle profile was similar to that exhibited by senescence induced by overexpressing Raf-1 oncogene or DNA-damaging agents that the cell cycle defects were not limited to G1 phase (13.Olsen C.L. Gardie B. Yaswen P. Stampfer M.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6328-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14.Chang B.D. Xuan Y. Broude E.V. Zhu H. Schott B. Fang J. Roninson I.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4808-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It is also apparent that the number of sub-G1 cells was also not increased upon PTTG1 expression. This suggested that PTTG1 did not induce apoptosis in these normal cells. The distribution of cell cycle stages of PTTG1-expressing cells was also distinctly different from cells entering replicative senescence that arrests in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Together our results indicated that expression of PTTG1 induced a cessation of cell proliferation without causing apparent G2/M arrest or apoptosis in normal fibroblasts. The morphology of the PTTG1-expressing normal fibroblasts was also observed. Four days after infection the PTTG1-expressed cells appeared to be flattened and enlarged, a phenotype similar to that of senescent cells (Fig. 2A and data not shown). The morphological changes were not limited to IMR90 as two other normal human fibroblast cell lines, BJ1 and WI38, also showed similar morphological changes (data not shown). These results suggested that PTTG1 overexpression induced senescent-like phenotype in normal fibroblasts. To confirm this observation, we assessed other senescence-associated features in the PTTG1-expressing fibroblasts. SA-β-gal activity (15.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar) was assessed in PTTG1- and GFP-expressing IMR90 cells. Our results clearly indicated that IMR90 cells expressing PTTG1 showed an induction of SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 2A). The percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells was similar for the GFP-expressing (∼11%) and the mock control cells (∼11%). In contrast, almost 25% of the PTTG1-expressing cells stained positive for SA-β-gal activities (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this, the proportion of BrdUrd-incorporating cells (16.Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was also reduced from ∼27 and ∼22% for normal and GFP-expressing cells to ∼7% for PTTG1-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). We further analyzed the presence of SAHF, a distinct DNA-dense heterochromatic structure that accumulates in senescent human fibroblasts, in these cells. Typically, one large nucleolus and punctuate DNA foci can be visualized by DAPI staining in senescent cells (17.Narita M. Nũnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 18.Zhang R. Poustovoitov M.V. Ye X. Santos H.A. Chen W. Daganzo S.M. Erzberger J.P. Serebriiskii I.G. Canutescu A.A. Dunbrack R.L. Pehrson J.R. Berger J.M. Kaufman P.D. Adams P.D. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, IMR90 cells overexpressing PTTG1 displayed an abnormal nuclear morphology with punctuate DNA foci. In comparison, GFP-expressing cells and mock control cells displayed a more uniform nuclear staining pattern (Fig. 2C). Quantitative analysis showed that there was a 4-fold increase in cells harboring SAHF foci in PTTG1-expressing cells compared with the control cells. To further confirm that the observed DNA foci were indeed SAHF, we conducted confocal fluorescence microscopy on PTTG1 senescent cells using modification-specific antibodies against histone H3-K9Me (17.Narita M. Nũnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). The LacZ-expressing and mock control cells expressed H3-K9Me distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 2D). In contrast, PTTG1-expressing cells showed a more distinctive localization of K9M-H3 signals, consistent with their preference for heterochromatic regions. Thus, the results demonstrated that the senescent program was initiated in response to PTTG1 overexpression in normal fibroblasts. To gain insight into the molecular basis of PTTG1-induced growth arrest and senescence in normal fibroblasts, we examined the expression pattern of several key cell cycle regulators that are involved in senescence using immunoblotting analysis. In IMR90 cells, PTTG1 overexpression consistently induced p53 expression and inhibited Rb protein expression and phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). These results suggested that activation of p53 and reduction of Rb protein phosphorylation are involved in PTTG1-induced senescence. Interestingly, although p21 and p16 have been implicated as key mediators in senescence, the levels of these two proteins were not significantly altered in IMR90 cells. Nevertheless, our results suggested that p53/Rb senescent pathway was activated in response to PTTG1 overexpression in these normal cells. To further investigate the requirement for p53 as part of PTTG1-induced senescence in normal fibroblasts, we utilized a sequence-specific RNA interference approach to knock down the p53 levels in normal cells using a lentiviral delivery system (12.Escarpe P. Zayek N. Chin P. Borellini F. Zufferey R. Veres G. Kiermer V. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 332-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The IMR90 cells were first transduced with shRNAs targeting p53 or luciferase and then infected with adenovirus-carrying PTTG1. As shown in Fig. 3B, the level of PTTG1-activated p53 was decreased upon shRNA treatments. Significantly, the growth of PTTG1-expressing cells was increased upon knocking down p53 expression (Fig. 3C). The results indicated that reduced p53 function could restore PTTG1-induced growth inhibition in normal cells. The SA-β-gal activity was then checked to evaluate the effect of a lower p53 level on PTTG1-induced senescence. In the p53 knockdown cells, the number of SA-β-gal-positive cells was also significantly lower than that of the control cells (Fig. 3D). We next evaluated the SAHF and abnormal nuclei morphologies in the p53 knockdown cells. As shown in Fig. 3, E and F, the numbers of cells with SAHF and abnormal nuclei were also decreased in the p53 knockdown cells. Thus, our results indicated that p53 is required for PTTG1-induced senescence in normal cells. In an independent experiment, we also applied two isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116 and its p53 knock-outs, in our studies (19.Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). PTTG1 or GFP was introduced into these cells with the adenovirus delivery system, and the relative survivals were then examined. Upon PTTG1 overexpression, the HCT116 cells ceased to proliferate upon PTTG1 expression (Fig. 4A). The proliferation was recovered in HCT116 cells carrying p53−/− mutations. The senescent phenotype was also analyzed in PTTG1-overexpressing HCT116 cells. Although the HCT116 cells showed <1% of senescent cells, the population was consistently increased to ∼2% upon PTTG1 overexpression (Fig. 4B). The elevated senescent cells were not observed in HCT116 cells carrying p53−/− mutations, indicating that PTTG1-induced senescence is p53-dependent. It is also interesting to note that the level of PTTG1-induced senescent cells in HCT116 cells was relatively low compared with that in IMR90 cells. Although the reason is still unclear to us, HCT116 cells might have an additional mechanism to prevent from entering senescence. Flow cytometry analyses were also conducted to determine the cell cycle effects of HCT116 cells upon PTTG1 overexpression. Consistent with the results of normal cells, the results indicated that the proportion of G1 cells was decreased in PTTG1-expressing HCT116 cells and was recovered in p53−/− cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, the inhibition of proliferation was partly due to the induction of senescence by PTTG1 overexpression. Together, our results indicated that p53 is required for PTTG1-induced growth inhibition in both normal and cancer cells. The mechanism of how PTTG1 expression induces senescence in normal fibroblasts was investigated. The PTTG1-induced senescence did not appear to be mediated through telomere as the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT-immortalized cell line BJ-hTERT also showed similar senescent phenotype (data not shown). Moreover, telomerase activity was not affected by PTTG1 overexpression in BJ-hTERT cells (data not shown). We then focused on the normal cellular function of PTTG1. Upon anaphase initiation, PTTG1 protein was destroyed by APC (anaphase-promoting complex), an ubiquitin-ligase, to activate separase. The activated separase then promotes the separation of sister chromatids by degrading cohesion molecules. Because PTTG1 is involved in inhibiting separase until anaphase initiation, the level of active separase was analyzed in PTTG1-overexpressing cells. Here, the auto-cleaved product of separase was used as an indicator for separase activation (20.Waizenegger I. Giménez-Abián J.F. Wernic D. Peters J.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1368-1378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, the active form of separase was greatly reduced upon PTTG1 overexpression. Thus, overexpression of PTTG1 might mimic a condition similar to separase depletion. Because both PTTG1 and separase are important regulators that control sister-chromatin separation and maintain genome stability, the effect of PTTG1 overexpression on the nuclear morphology of normal fibroblasts was next analyzed. Cells that expressed PTTG1 were stained with Hoechst 33258 to visualize the nuclear morphology under a fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear dysmorphism, such as irregular contour and multiple lobules and folds, was clearly observed in cells expressing PTTG1. The proportion of cells with enlarged nuclei or micronuclei was also increased in PTTG1-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). Upon scoring the number of abnormal nuclei, we found that a total of about 32% of the PTTG1-expressing cells showed abnormal nuclei, a 2-fold increase over the LacZ-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). These results suggested that PTTG1-expressing cells might undergo severe chromosome instability. We, thus, prepared metaphase chromosomes to examine chromosome integrity in the PTTG1-expressing cells. The structure of the chromosomes was observed and scored individually using a fluorescence microscopy. When the control and LacZ-expressed cells were examined, they showed a normal chromosomes spread (Fig. 5C). However, the chromosomes of the PTTG1-expressing cells showed a high level of abnormalities including an elevated level of aneuploidy, end-to-end fusions, and chromosome breaks (data not shown). The most striking feature observed in the PTTG1-expressing cells was partially paired sister chromatids with centromere separation, which is an indication of premature anaphase sister chromosome separation (Fig. 5C). By scoring the number of cells with abnormal chromosomes, it was found that ∼12.7% of the PTTG1-expressing cells showed abnormal chromosomes, which contrasted with 2.7 and 3.8% of the mock control and LacZ-expressing cells, respectively (data not shown). Thus, our results clearly indicated that PTTG1 overexpression in normal fibroblasts caused chromosome abnormalities. We next test if the abnormal chromosomes observed in PTTG1-expressing cells could induce DNA-damage responses that lead to senescence. The phosphorylation level of H2AX (γ-H2AX) was examined, as it is known to play a very early and important role in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (21.Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, a significant induction of γ-H2AX was observed in response to PTTG1 overexpression in the three different normal cell lines. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis also revealed that up to ∼45% of the PTTG1-expressing cells were stained positive for γ-H2AX foci formation (Fig. 6B). To determine the role of p53 in PTTG1-induced DNA damage response, the level of γ-H2AX was also determined in PTTG1-expressing cells with reduced p53 expression using shRNA. As shown in Fig. 6C, reduction of p53 is accompanied by reduction of γ-H2AX. Immunostaining analysis also showed that the γ-H2AX foci-positive cells were decreased in PTTG1 expression cells that also expressed p53 shRNA (Fig. 6D). The results indicated that a p53-dependent DNA damage response pathway was induced in PTTG1-expressing normal fibroblasts. Similar to that of normal fibroblasts, the p53 level was increased upon PTTG1 expression in HCT116 p53+/+ cells (Fig. 6E). The level of γ-H2AX in PTTG1-expressing cells was also increased in p53+/+ cells, suggesting that a DNA-damage response was activated in these cells. Similar to that in normal cells, immunofluorescence microscopy analysis also revealed that up to ∼40% of the PTTG1-expressing HCT116 p53+/+ cells were stained positive for γ-H2AX foci formation (Fig. 6F). Together these results indicated that the DNA-damage response was triggered when PTTG1 was overexpressed in normal fibroblasts. Under normal culture conditions, normal diploid fibroblasts undergo a limited number of cell divisions and then cease proliferation. It is well documented that cellular senescence is caused by an attrition of the telomeres after repeated cycles of cell divisions (22.Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (3011) Google Scholar). The shortened telomeres then induce a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. Here we showed that forced expression of PTTG1 in normal human fibroblasts also induced senescent phenotype. However, because the senescent phenotype was also detected in PTTG1-expressing BJ-hTERT cells and telomerase was not affected upon PTTG1 expression, it is unlikely that telomere shortening is participated in PTTG1-induced senescence. Senescence induced by forced PTTG1 expression is different from that of replicative senescence. Here our results provide evidence that PTTG1-induced senescence is mediated by a p53-dependent DNA-damage response pathway. First, PTTG1 overexpression increased the formation of abnormal chromosomes, which is an indication of chromosome instability. Second, DNA damage-induced γH2AX foci were detected in PTTG1-expressing fibroblasts. Third, the PTTG1-induced senescence was associated with an elevation in p53 and a deceased in both Rb protein and phosphorylated Rb levels. Finally, RNA interference experiments demonstrated that down-regulation of p53 abolished the PTTG1-induced senescent phenotype and DNA damage response. Thus, the PTTG1-induced senescence closely resembles the senescent phenotype in response to oncogene expression or DNA damage stresses in normal human fibroblasts (11.Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Forced expression of several oncogenes has been shown to cause senescence through a p53-dependent pathway. For example, oncogene ras has been shown to transform immortal rodent NIH 3T3 cells into a tumorigenic state; however, forced ras expression induces normal human or rodent cells to undergo senescence (23.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). It appears that these oncogenes have dual roles in tumorigenesis; they trigger the senescence pathway to protect normal cells from transformation at an early stage of tumorigenesis and then promote tumor progression at a late stage of tumorigenesis (11.Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Similarly, introduction of PTTG1 into NIH 3T3 cells results in tumor transformation both in vitro and in vivo (1.Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), and we showed that overexpression of PTTG1-induced senescence in normal cells. Thus, it is likely that PTTG1 also has dual roles in tumorigenesis. In additional to its role in the late stage of promoting tumor progression, our results indicated that PTTG1 might also have a role in early tumorigenesis. To account for these results, it is anticipated that PTTG1 is overexpressed in the early stage of tumorigenesis. Indeed, it was shown that the rat PTTG was been found to be expressed coincidently with the early lactotrophic hyperplastic response, angiogenesis, and prolactinoma development (24.Heaney A.P. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Singson R. Melmed S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The senescence induced by PTTG1 overexpression might prevent the transformation of normal cells at early stage of tumorigenesis. Overcoming senescence during early tumor progression may be quite difficult, as it would require the inactivation of the DNA-damage checkpoint response pathways. However, chromosome abnormalities accumulated in PTTG1-expressing cells might provide a better chance for cells to escape senescence. Thus, PTTG1 overexpression might also promote further tumor progression. Alternatively or additionally, because it was been shown that senescent human fibroblasts stimulated hyperproliferation and the progression of pre-neoplastic epithelial cells as well as accelerating the tumorigenesis by neoplastic epithelial cells (25.Krtolica A. Parrinello S. Lockett S. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12072-12077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), the PTTG1-expressing senescent fibroblasts might themselves promote tumorigenesis of precancerous epithelial cells. Nevertheless, our results suggested that, in additional to its role in later stages of tumor progression, PTTG1 might also have a role in early stage of tumorigenesis. Because PTTG1 has been shown to interact with different protein partners to mediate various functions, it is possible that the cellular effects observed in PTTG1-overexpressed normal cells are caused by these various interactions. Here we consider that the senescent phenotype observed in this study is primarily caused by its effects in mitotic cell cycle regulation. Separase is a cysteine protease responsible for cleaving the cohesion complex and is involved in chromatid separation during mitosis (26.Nasmyth K. Peters J.M. Uhlmann F. Science. 2000; 288: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Because a role of PTTG1 is to inhibit separase activity through protein-protein interactions, PTTG1 overexpression could induce cellular effects resembling separase defects. In budding yeast, failed sister-chromatid separation, gross chromosome mis-segregation, and decreased viability has been observed in cells with the separase esp1 mutation (27.McGrew J.T. Goetsch L. Byers B. Baum P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28.Ciosk R. Zachariae W. Michaelis C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1998; 93: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Similar observations were found in fission yeast, Drosophila, and zebrafish with the separase mutation (29.Funabiki H. Kumada K. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6617-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30.Herzig A. Lehner C.F. Heidmann S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2443-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31.Shepard J.L. Amatruda J.F. Finkelstein D. Ziai J. Finley K.R. Stern H.M. Chiang K. Hersey C. Barut B. Freeman J.L. Lee C. Glickman J.N. Kutok J.L. Aster J.C. Zon L.I. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we showed that active separase level was indeed decreased upon PTTG1 overexpression. Moreover, we found that PTTG1 overexpression induced a cessation of cell proliferation and a senescent phenotype in normal fibroblasts. We also found that PTTG1 overexpression caused abnormal chromosome separation, consistent with the role of PTTG1 in regulating sister-chromatid separation. Thus, it is very likely that the cellular effects we observed in PTTG1-overexpressing cells are caused by inducing a situation similar to that of separase loss. Interestingly, unlike yeast cells, which lack separase, are not viable, and stop the cell cycle at M phase (32.Baum P. Yip C. Goetsch L. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5386-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the chromosome instability induced by PTTG1 overexpression causes normal human fibroblasts to enter a p53-dependent senescence. Because a role of PTTG1-p53 interaction is in the regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells (8.Bernal J.A. Luna R. Espina A. Lázaro I. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Arias C. Silva A. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether the interaction might participate in determining senescence in normal cells. It is also interesting to note that although p53 appears to be a key factor in PTTG1-induced senescence, both p21 and p16 levels are not significantly altered upon PTTG1 overexpression in IMR90 cells. Thus, unlike p53, the roles of p21 and p16 in the PTTG1-induced cellular effects are less clear. We thank members of the Institute of Biopharmaceutical Science for help and support. We thank Y.

https://openalex.org/W1978884148,"The reductive carboxylation of ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) from Candida utilis was investigated using kinetic isotope effects. The intrinsic isotope effect for proton abstraction from Ru5P was found at 4.9 from deuterium isotope effects on V and V/K and from tritium isotope effects on V/K. The presence of 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) in the assay mixture changes the magnitude of the observed isotope effects. In the absence of 6PG (D)(V/K) and (D)(V) are 1.68 and 2.46, respectively, whereas the presence of 6PG increases (D)(V/K) to 2.84 and decreases (D)(V) to 1.38. A similar increase of (T)(V/K) is observed as 6PG builds up in the reaction mixture. These data indicate that in the absence of 6PG, a slow step, which precedes the chemical process, is rate-limiting for the reaction, whereas in the presence of 6PG, the rate-limiting step follows the isotope-sensitive step. Kinetic analysis of reductive carboxylation shows that 6PG at low concentrations decreases the K(m) of Ru5P, whereas at higher concentrations, the usual competitive pattern is observed. These data indicate that full activity of 6PGDH is achieved when one subunit carries out the catalysis and the other subunit carries an unreacted 6PG. Thus, 6PG is like an allosteric activator of 6PGDH."
