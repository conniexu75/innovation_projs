https://openalex.org/W2078627623,"Freshwater wetland ecosystems do not effectively conserve phosphorus in the way that terrestrial ecosystems do. The phosphorus retention capacity varies greatly among bogs, fens, and swamps and is concomitant with the amorphous acid oxalate-extractable aluminum and iron content in the soil. However, the phosphorus adsorption potential in wetland ecosystems may be predicted solely from the extractable aluminum content of the soil. Wetlands tested as wastewater filtration systems became phosphorus-saturated in a few years, with the export of excessive quantities of phosphate."

Moreover, 12 of 100 field-collected crickets are heteroplasmic, that is these individuals have more than one size class of mitochondrial DNA. No heteroplasmy for restriction site variation is observed. Intraindividual variation in cricket mitochondrial DNA provides a useful marker for studying the transmission genetics of mitochondrial DNA. Available data on patterns of variation in mothers and offspring suggest that random segregation of mitochondrial DNA variants does not occur rapidly in cricket germ-cell lineages."

https://openalex.org/W2068353421,"Spermatogenesis is limited to summer and fall, and females are inseminated during the fall concurrent with ovulation and fertilization. While most of the embryonic development is deferred until March, there is slow growth of embryo and placenta during the winter. This sequence is termed ""delayed development."" Birth is in June, and the young bats are able to join the forage flights by August."

These glands are smaller and show regressive changes in specimens of the bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas found in fresh-water environment, compared with specimens of this and other species from a marine habitat."

https://openalex.org/W2104269508,Increase in twilight glow and in the dust stripes in the twilight arch have been observed from several places in the northern hemisphere from the fall of 1963 until now. Measurements of the twilight brightness indicate a considerable increase of dustiness in the stratosphere; this turbidity may be due to drifting ashes from the eruption of Agung volcano on Bali.
https://openalex.org/W1987763977,"Adult boll weevils exhibited a daily rhythm in their susceptibility to standardized doses of the insecticide, methyl parathion. The mortality produced by the insecticide was intimately related to the time of day at which the toxicant was applied. The rhythm appeared to be photoperiodically entrained and, regardless of the length of day or ""clock time-of-day of treatment,"" a period of greatest resistance always occurred at dawn and recurred at 6-hour intervals throughout the 24-hour cycle. The greatest difference in response occurred in a photoperiod having 10 hours of light per 24-hour cycle. Here, the same dose of methyl parathion killed approximately 10 percent of the weevils treated at dawn but almost 90 percent of those treated only 3 hours later."
https://openalex.org/W2091994776,"The mold Neurospora crassa ATCC 5297a was grown in gaseous environments of helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, or nitrogen containing approximately 5 percent oxygen. A close correlation of the growth rate R (in millimeters per hour at 30 degrees C) with the molecular weight MW of the chemically inert gas was observed. This correlation is described by the empirical equation: R = 3.88 - 0.1785 (MW)."

https://openalex.org/W2031062156,"2-Aminoethylphosphonic acid has been isolated from a hydrolysate of insoluble proteinaceous material of Metridium dianthus in 1.1 percent yield. It appears to be incorporated in the protein structure; when trichloroacetic acid is added to partial hydrolysates, precipitates form from which this compound is released on complete hydrolysis. The phosphonic acid was also detected in hydrolysates of the 70-percent ethanol- and chloroform-soluble fractions of the sea anemone. The total amount isolated accounted for 0.99 percent of the dry weight of the animal."
https://openalex.org/W2048090451,"Absorption spectra of selected microsections of materials with pressure-sensitive absorption bands mounted in diamond-anvil high-pressure cells were determined. The shift in the absorption peak, combined with data obtained at uniform pressure, permits calculation of the pressure of the microsection selected. Examples of a parabolic decrease in pressure from the center to the edge of the diamond anvil are demonstrated by contour diagrams."
https://openalex.org/W1980230634,"The excessive cracking and distortion that old waterlogged wood undergoes when it is dried can be substantially reduced by treating the wood with polyethylene glycol. The process was used to dry 200-year-old waterlogged wood boats recently raised from Lake George, New York."
https://openalex.org/W2059344984,"The diapause of the pink bollworm is under photoperiodic control. Diapause is prevented when the dark phases of the daily photoperiod are 8 to 10 hours in duration. If the dark period is extended to 12 hours, diapause is induced. Intercalation of 8- or 10-hour nights may reverse the diapause induction caused by exposure to photocycles having 12-hour dark phases. The 10-hour night was much more effective in reversing induction than the 8-hour night. The intensity of diapause, in part, appeared to be dependent on the previous photoperiodic experiences of the test animals."

https://openalex.org/W2030175479,"Some 70,000 larvae of the California sardine, collected from about 10,000 plankton hauls over the years 1950 to 1957, have been sorted by lengths and enumerated. The numbers of the day-caught larvae are very closely a numerical measure of the apparent mortality as indicated by the night-caught larvae. Over a considerable interval of size, the night-caught larvae appear to be representative of the entire larval population, but the day-caught larvae may represent a fraction that is a measure of the natural mortality of the population."

In a similar process, the formation of new interfaces during protoplasmic syntheses could sustain gradients of interfacial tension with resulting protoplasmic movements."

https://openalex.org/W1999301482,"26 April was a day for celebrating at the Los Alamos National Laboratory as jubilant researchers stored a beam in the Proton Storage Ring (PSR) on the very first attempt. The PSR is a $22-million addition to the Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) facility whose effect will be to convert the WNR into a world-class pulsed source for neutron scattering on a par with the British Spallation Neutron Source that recently entered the commissioning phase at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (l). The combined WNR/PSR facility will be dedicated this August as the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE). However, two important provisos to be satisfied before researchers can tap the intense neutron beam the WNR/PSR will provide are the construction of an experimental hall sufficiently large to house research instrumentation and the development of the instrumentation itself. Now set at $17.5 million, funding for this purpose has never made it into the presidential budget."

The more readily available the iron, the less influence an increase in day length on dry weight. When iron was present but not chelated the plants remained green in a 16-hour day but became chlorotic in a 9-hour day."
