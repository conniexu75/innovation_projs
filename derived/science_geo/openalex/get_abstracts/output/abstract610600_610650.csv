Here, we pioneer a protein tag, LlamaTag, which circumvents this maturation limit by binding mature fluorescent proteins, making it possible to visualize transcription factor concentration dynamics in live embryos. Implementing this approach in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we discovered stochastic bursts in the concentration of transcription factors that are correlated with bursts in transcription. We further used LlamaTags to show that the concentration of protein in a given nucleus heavily depends on transcription of that gene in neighboring nuclei; we speculate that this inter-nuclear signaling is an important mechanism for coordinating gene expression to delineate straight and sharp boundaries of gene expression. Thus, LlamaTags now make it possible to visualize the flow of information along the central dogma in live embryos.

Thus, LlamaTags now make it possible to visualize the flow of information along the central dogma in live embryos. The cells of a developing embryo often make rapid decisions about their fate. For example, body segments of the zebrafish embryo are specified in <25 min, and a mature stripe of the segmentation gene even-skipped (eve) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is defined in <15 min (Bothma et al., 2014Bothma J.P. Garcia H.G. Esposito E. Schlissel G. Gregor T. Levine M. Dynamic regulation of eve stripe 2 expression reveals transcriptional bursts in living Drosophila embryos.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dynamics of zebrafish somitogenesis.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These cell-fate decisions are driven by the concentration dynamics of transcription factors. For example, the frequency of oscillation of her1 and her7 determines vertebrae number (Schröter et al., 2008Schröter C. Herrgen L. Cardona A. Brouhard G.J. Feldman B. Oates A.C. Dynamics of zebrafish somitogenesis.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the precise temporal progression of the expression of transcription factors in neural progenitors in flies and vertebrates dictates neural fates (Kohwi and Doe, 2013Kohwi M. Doe C.Q. Temporal fate specification and neural progenitor competence during development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Our knowledge of how these crucial dynamics specify fate has been hampered by available technology. The widespread use of fluorescent protein fusions to transcription factors has been limited by the slow maturation step that must occur before these fusions become fluorescent. Although engineered fluorescent proteins have chromophore maturation half-times as low as 4 min in vitro or in cultured cells (Balleza et al., 2018Balleza E. Kim J.M. Cluzel P. Systematic characterization of maturation time of fluorescent proteins in living cells.Nat. Methods. 2018; 15: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), these half-times increase to >30 min in the embryos of model organisms, such as frogs, zebrafish, worms, and flies (Dickinson et al., 2017Dickinson D.J.

Dyn. 2007; 236: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This timescale is much slower than many key processes in development. For example, the fly transcription factor Fushi Tarazu (Ftz) has a half-life of ∼8 min (Edgar et al., 1987Edgar B.A. Odell G.M. Schubiger G. Cytoarchitecture and the patterning of fushi tarazu expression in the Drosophila blastoderm.Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1226-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the Her proteins in vertebrates have half-lives of 3–20 min (Ay et al., 2013Ay A.

This rapid protein turnover makes visualizing the expression of these transcription factors in real time nearly impossible; the fusion protein of interest has already degraded by the time the reporter begins to fluoresce (Figure 1A). As a result, attempts to measure transcription factor patterns in live embryos with fluorescent protein fusions have yielded undetectable or significantly delayed patterns (Drocco et al., 2011Drocco J.A.

Consequences of eukaryotic enhancer architecture for gene expression dynamics, development, and fitness.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002364Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, fluorescent protein maturation kinetics remains a major hindrance to the live imaging of cell-fate decisions during embryonic development (Figure 1B; STAR Methods). Here, we present a novel genetically encoded tagging technique for visualizing transcription factor spatiotemporal dynamics in development by overcoming the slow kinetics of fluorescent-protein maturation. This tag is based on nanobodies, small single-domain antibodies derived from llamas (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Naturally occurring antibodies devoid of light chains.Nature. 1993; 363: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar), which we name LlamaTags. Our strategy employs the spatial localization of already mature fluorescent proteins as a reporter of protein concentration dynamics (Aymoz et al., 2016Aymoz D. Wosika V. Durandau E. Pelet S. Real-time quantification of protein expression at the single-cell level via dynamic protein synthesis translocation reporters.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), rather than relying on the production of transcription factor-fluorescent protein fusions. Nanobodies are extremely versatile and present significant advantages over previous technologies for quantifying transcription factor dynamics in live embryos (see the Discussion for further details). Their small size of ∼15 kDa is ideal for limiting perturbations of the tagged protein’s endogenous function, and the binding of a nanobody and its target is fast (∼106 M−1s−1) and of high affinity (pM-nM) (Fridy et al., 2014Fridy P.C. Li Y. Keegan S. Thompson M.K. Nudelman I. Scheid J.F. Oeffinger M. Nussenzweig M.C. Fenyö D. Chait B.T. Rout M.P. A robust pipeline for rapid production of versatile nanobody repertoires.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Kirchhofer et al., 2010Kirchhofer A. Helma J. Schmidthals K. Frauer C. Cui S. Karcher A. Pellis M. Muyldermans S. Casas-Delucchi C.S. Cardoso M.C. et al.Modulation of protein properties in living cells using nanobodies.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Nanobodies have been used for a broad range of applications from stabilizing protein structure to targeting proteins to a particular subcellular location (for a thorough review of these applications, see Bieli et al., 2016Bieli D. Alborelli I. Harmansa S. Matsuda S. Caussinus E. Affolter M. Development and application of functionalized protein binders in multicellular organisms.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2016; 325: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and the references therein). We established the simplicity of tagging and the wide array of measurements enabled by LlamaTags by using the development of the fruit fly as a case study. Further, by combining LlamaTags with the MS2 aptamer system for in vivo tagging of nascent mRNA (Larson et al., 2009Larson D.R. Singer R.H. Zenklusen D. A single molecule view of gene expression.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 630-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we simultaneously visualized transcription factor concentration and transcription. Thus, LlamaTags are a versatile tool to quantify how developmental programs are deployed in real time at the single-cell level in live embryos. To visualize the endogenous concentration dynamics of a transcription factor of interest, we fuse the transcription factor to a nanobody raised against enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and express it under the transcription factor’s endogenous regulatory sequence in conjunction with maternally deposited eGFP, ensuring ample time for eGFP maturation before the gene is expressed. When the transcription factor-nanobody fusion is translated, it binds cytoplasmic eGFP on the timescale of seconds and increases the fluorescence of bound eGFP by 1.5-fold (Figure 1C, see below; STAR Methods) (Kirchhofer et al., 2010Kirchhofer A. Helma J. Schmidthals K. Frauer C. Cui S. Karcher A. Pellis M. Muyldermans S. Casas-Delucchi C.S. Cardoso M.C. et al.Modulation of protein properties in living cells using nanobodies.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). As the LlamaTagged transcription factor is imported into the nucleus to perform its regulatory function, the eGFP is imported too (Figures 1C and 1D). Expression of the LlamaTagged protein leads to an increase in nuclear fluorescence that constitutes a direct readout of the instantaneous transcription factor concentration in each nucleus. To ensure that mature eGFP was present in the early fly embryo before the gene of interest is expressed, we employed a transgene that expresses eGFP in developing oocytes; female flies containing this construct deposit eGFP mRNA in their eggs, and, upon fertilization, this mRNA is translated into protein (Gregor et al., 2008Gregor T. McGregor A.P. Wieschaus E.F. Shape and function of the Bicoid morphogen gradient in dipteran species with different sized embryos.Dev. Biol. 2008; 316: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The eGFP rapidly diffuses, matures, and yields uniform fluorescence throughout the embryo by nuclear cycle 14 (nc14). Although LlamaTags cannot differentiate between mature and immature eGFP, this system ensures that all eGFP is mature when the genes that define the adult body plan are expressed (Jaeger et al., 2004Jaeger J. Surkova S. Blagov M. Janssens H. Kosman D. Kozlov K.N. Manu Myasnikova E. Vanario-Alonso C.E. Samsonova M. et al.Dynamic control of positional information in the early Drosophila embryo.Nature. 2004; 430: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) (Figures 2A and S1A). eGFP does not contain a nuclear localization signal and, in the absence of a LlamaTag, shows only weak nuclear enrichment (Figures 2A and S1B), thus providing an ideal framework for imaging nuclearly localized LlamaTagged transcription factors (Figures S2 and S3).Figure S1eGFP Expression throughout the Embryo, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) In the absence of LlamaTagged proteins, the cytoplasmic eGFP levels are uniform throughout the embryo.

To test the ability of LlamaTags to report on transcription factor dynamics, we tagged the Hunchback (Hb) protein at its endogenous locus in the Drosophila genome using CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination (Figure 2B; see Table S1 for primer sequences) (Gratz et al., 2015Gratz S.J. Rubinstein C.D. Harrison M.M. Wildonger J. O’Connor-Giles K.M. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in Drosophila.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2015; 111 (31.2.1-20)Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Hb is expressed in the anterior half of the early embryo, where it plays a critical role in specifying the fly body plan (Margolis et al., 1995Margolis J.S. Borowsky M.L. Steingrímsson E. Shim C.W. Lengyel J.A. Posakony J.W. Posterior stripe expression of hunchback is driven from two promoters by a common enhancer element.Development. 1995; 121: 3067-3077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Perry et al., 2012Perry M.W. Bothma J.P. Luu R.D. Levine M. Precision of hunchback expression in the Drosophila embryo.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 2247-2252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Imaging live embryos that contained both eGFP and the LlamaTagged hb locus using laser-scanning confocal microscopy revealed a pattern of bright fluorescent nuclei (Figure 2C; Video S1) that appeared virtually identical to the endogenous Hb pattern previously visualized in fixed embryos at different stages of development using immunohistochemistry (Figure 2D, images taken from FlyEx database) (see Pisarev et al., 2009Pisarev A. Poustelnikova E. Samsonova M. Reinitz J. FlyEx, the quantitative atlas on segmentation gene expression at cellular resolution.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D560-D566Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Hb-LlamaTag pattern was initially restricted to the anterior half of the embryo, and then later developed a strong stripe of expression midway along the body axis, as well as a posterior stripe characteristic of the endogenous Hb pattern. Quantification of Hb levels revealed that Hb protein concentration increases by >5 times during nc14 (Figure S4A). The Hb-LlamaTag fusion was functionally equivalent to the endogenous protein: flies homozygous for the hb-LlamaTag chromosome rescued to adulthood, even in the presence of maternally provided eGFP. To determine whether LlamaTags accurately report protein concentration dynamics, we fixed embryos homozygous for the LlamaTagged hb locus and maternally provided fluorescent eGFP. After fixation, we fluorescently labeled Hb in these embryos in a separate channel using immunohistochemistry. Formaldehyde fixation rapidly halts any binding and unbinding of eGFP to the LlamaTag such that the fixed embryo represents an instantaneous snapshot of Hb-LlamaTag dynamics. We quantified both the nuclear intensity of eGFP and the Hb concentration as reported by immunofluorescence. The eGFP signal reporting the LlamaTag concentration was linearly related to the anti-Hb signal (Figure 2E), providing concrete evidence that the nuclear eGFP intensity in live embryos is a direct and quantitative readout of the amount of tagged protein present at any given moment. The linearity between the eGFP and anti-Hb signals (Figure 2E) also suggests that the rapid binding kinetics of nanobodies in vitro is preserved in our in vivo LlamaTag system. In the STAR Methods, we show that if the binding between eGFP and the LlamaTag were slow relative to the dynamics of the Hb protein pattern, then a non-linear relation would appear in Figure 2E. The linear fit in Figure 2E also reveals an offset in the LlamaTag signal with respect to immunostaining (non-zero y-intercept). We associate this offset with excess, unbound eGFP molecules in the nucleus. In STAR Methods, we discuss a strategy for determining this offset, which we subtract from all data shown below. Taken together, these measurements demonstrate the ability of LlamaTags to report faithfully on endogenous transcription factor dynamics in development. Next, we sought to expand the color palette to enable multicolor imaging for the simultaneous quantification of multiple transcription factors. We designed an mCherryLlamaTag using a nanobody that binds the mCherry fluorescent protein with high affinity and specificity (Fridy et al., 2014Fridy P.C. Li Y. Keegan S. Thompson M.K. Nudelman I. Scheid J.F. Oeffinger M. Nussenzweig M.C. Fenyö D. Chait B.T. Rout M.P. A robust pipeline for rapid production of versatile nanobody repertoires.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Specifically, we fused the mCherryLlamaTag to the endogenous Twist (Twi) protein using CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination. We simultaneously imaged the endogenous Twist and Hunchback patterns by examining embryos containing maternally supplied eGFP and mCherry in addition to the Hb-eGFPLlamaTag and Twi-mCherryLlamaTag loci (Figure 2F). The patterns of each transcription factor in their corresponding channels were consistent with previous observations (Ip et al., 1992Ip Y.T. Park R.E. Kosman D. Yazdanbakhsh K. Levine M. dorsal-twist interactions establish snail expression in the presumptive mesoderm of the Drosophila embryo.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1518-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), suggesting that both LlamaTags are completely orthogonal and do not cross-react (Figure S4). Nuclei expressing Hb in regions of the embryo where no Twi expression is expected had no nuclear enrichment of mCherry. Similarly, nuclei in the Twi expression domain, but outside the Hb domain, displayed no nuclear enrichment of eGFP. These results demonstrate the versatility of the LlamaTag system to visualize multiple proteins simultaneously. We sought to determine whether this approach is suitable for imaging transcription factors at later development stages, once cellularization has occurred and cells move below the embryo surface. In addition to Hb’s role in setting up the body axis of the embryo, this protein also patterns the nervous system by specifying the fate of neural progenitor cells (neuroblasts) and the neurons and glia that these progenitors give rise to (Kohwi and Doe, 2013Kohwi M. Doe C.Q. Temporal fate specification and neural progenitor competence during development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Figure 3A shows the ventrolateral surface of a stage 9 embryo that contains maternal eGFP, LlamaTagged Hb, and has its histones marked with red fluorescent protein (RFP). Beneath this outer layer of cells, we observed cells that were morphologically distinct from those above (Figure 3B). From their enlarged nuclear morphology and grid-like arrangement (Doe, 1992Doe C.Q. Molecular markers for identified neuroblasts and ganglion mother cells in the Drosophila central nervous system.Development. 1992; 116: 855-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we identified them as neuroblasts. As expected (Kohwi and Doe, 2013Kohwi M. Doe C.Q. Temporal fate specification and neural progenitor competence during development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), Hb was expressed in a subset of these neuroblasts (high levels of nuclear eGFP, Figure 3B). We followed the rapid changes in Hb expression in the developing nervous system over several hours (Video S2). In contrast to the well-understood process of neuroblast formation, the specification of the cells each neuroblast gives rise to is still an active area of research in many model organisms (Kohwi and Doe, 2013Kohwi M. Doe C.Q. Temporal fate specification and neural progenitor competence during development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This identity is dictated by the sequential expression of a series of transcription factors, including Hb, in the neuroblast (Kohwi and Doe, 2013Kohwi M. Doe C.Q. Temporal fate specification and neural progenitor competence during development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Using LlamaTags, we determined that cells in the proneural cluster outlined in Figure 3A all initially expressed Hb at low levels (Figures 3C–3F). Over 10 min, the cells upregulated Hb to varying degrees, with one cell expressing high levels of Hb, whereas the others in the proneural cluster downregulated Hb. This “winner” changed its morphology and dived into the embryo interior to become a neuroblast (Figure 3F). Minutes later, the neuroblast underwent its first asymmetric division to generate a ganglion mother cell (Figures S5A and S5B) (Kohwi and Doe, 2013Kohwi M. Doe C.Q. Temporal fate specification and neural progenitor competence during development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar. We also measured LlamaTagged Hb in the nuclei of a subset of terminally differentiated neurons in the deepest layers of the nerve cord 13 hr after fertilization (Figures S5C and S5D). Thus, LlamaTags make it possible to observe tight temporal coupling between transcription factor dynamics and fate specification in cells within deep tissues over long timescales. After confirming that LlamaTags accurately report the concentration dynamics of transcription factor patterns in live Drosophila embryos, we turned our attention to Ftz, a transcription factor that is key to body plan segmentation (Edgar et al., 1987Edgar B.A. Odell G.M. Schubiger G. Cytoarchitecture and the patterning of fushi tarazu expression in the Drosophila blastoderm.Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1226-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Earlier work in fixed samples showed that Ftz expression is highly dynamic: the protein initially occurs in a broad pattern throughout the embryo that refines to seven sharply delineated stripes in <20 min (FlyEx database) (see Pisarev et al., 2009Pisarev A. Poustelnikova E. Samsonova M. Reinitz J. FlyEx, the quantitative atlas on segmentation gene expression at cellular resolution.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D560-D566Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The short half-lives (∼8 min) of Ftz mRNA and protein are believed to underpin the transient nature of this pattern (Edgar et al., 1986Edgar B.A. Weir M.P. Schubiger G. Kornberg T. Repression and turnover pattern fushi tarazu RNA in the early Drosophila embryo.Cell. 1986; 47: 747-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Edgar et al., 1987Edgar B.A. Odell G.M. Schubiger G. Cytoarchitecture and the patterning of fushi tarazu expression in the Drosophila blastoderm.Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1226-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We fused our LlamaTag to the C terminus of a ftz mini-gene that recapitulates endogenous Ftz expression in the early embryo (Hiromi et al., 1985Hiromi Y. Kuroiwa A. Gehring W.J. Control elements of the Drosophila segmentation gene fushi tarazu.Cell. 1985; 43: 603-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Imaging of embryos containing this transgene and maternal eGFP revealed the first real-time analysis of Ftz concentration changing in space and time in a live embryo (Figure 4A; Video S3). At the beginning of nc14, Ftz was present uniformly throughout the embryo. As development progressed, this pattern refined into the characteristic seven well-defined stripes (Figure 4A). Extraction of the Ftz concentration dynamics in single nuclei revealed that, in the regions of the embryo that will ultimately contain Ftz stripes, the rate of protein synthesis exceeds that of degradation, leading to a sustained increase in Ftz levels (Figure 4B). However, in nuclei outside the stripes, Ftz production ceased, and rapid degradation led to undetectable amounts of protein (Figure 4C). This interplay between synthesis and degradation of transcription factors has been speculated to shape the gene expression patterns that drive the developmental regulatory network in t"
https://openalex.org/W2950234133,"Conditioned place preference (CPP) is a widely used model of addiction-related behavior whose underlying mechanisms are not understood. In this study, we used dual site silicon probe recordings in freely moving mice to examine interactions between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens in cocaine CPP. We found that CPP was associated with recruitment of D2-positive nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons to fire in the cocaine-paired location, and this recruitment was driven predominantly by selective strengthening of coupling with hippocampal place cells that encode the cocaine-paired location. These findings provide in vivo evidence suggesting that the synaptic potentiation in the accumbens caused by repeated cocaine administration preferentially affects inputs that were active at the time of drug exposure. This provides a potential physiological mechanism by which drug use becomes associated with specific environmental contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2801674502,"Exercise has been suggested to ameliorate the detrimental effects of chemotherapy on skeletal muscle. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of different exercise regimens with usual care on skeletal muscle morphology and mitochondrial markers in patients being treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer. Specifically, we compared moderate-intensity aerobic training combined with high-intensity interval training (AT-HIIT) and resistance training combined with high-intensity interval training (RT-HIIT) with usual care (UC). Resting skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained pre- and postintervention from 23 randomly selected women from the OptiTrain breast cancer trial who underwent RT-HIIT, AT-HIIT, or UC for 16 wk. Over the intervention, citrate synthase activity, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, capillaries per fiber, and myosin heavy chain isoform type I were reduced in UC, whereas RT-HIIT and AT-HIIT were able to counteract these declines. AT-HIIT promoted up-regulation of the electron transport chain protein levels vs. UC. RT-HIIT favored satellite cell count vs. UC and AT-HIIT. There was a significant association between change in citrate synthase activity and self-reported fatigue. AT-HIIT and RT-HIIT maintained or improved markers of skeletal muscle function compared with the declines found in the UC group, indicating a sustained trainability in addition to the preservation of skeletal muscle structural and metabolic characteristics during chemotherapy. These findings highlight the importance of supervised exercise programs for patients with breast cancer during chemotherapy.-Mijwel, S., Cardinale, D.

https://openalex.org/W2801981707,"The efficacy and duration of memory storage is regulated by neuromodulatory transmitter actions. While the modulatory transmitter serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in implicit forms of memory in the invertebrate Aplysia, its function in explicit memory mediated by the mammalian hippocampus is less clear. Specifically, the consequences elicited by the spatio-temporal gradient of endogenous 5-HT release are not known. Here we applied optogenetic techniques in mice to gain insight into this fundamental biological process. We find that activation of serotonergic terminals in the hippocampal CA1 region both potentiates excitatory transmission at CA3-to-CA1 synapses and enhances spatial memory. Conversely, optogenetic silencing of CA1 5-HT terminals inhibits spatial memory. We furthermore find that synaptic potentiation is mediated by 5-HT4 receptors and that systemic modulation of 5-HT4 receptor function can bidirectionally impact memory formation. Collectively, these data reveal powerful modulatory influence of serotonergic synaptic input on hippocampal function and memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2800949330,"Summary Hydrogen gas-evolving membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) and quinone-reducing complex I are homologous respiratory complexes with a common ancestor, but a structural basis for their evolutionary relationship is lacking. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of a 14-subunit MBH from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus. MBH contains a membrane-anchored hydrogenase module that is highly similar structurally to the quinone-binding Q-module of complex I while its membrane-embedded ion-translocation module can be divided into a H+- and a Na+-translocating unit. The H+-translocating unit is rotated 180° in-membrane with respect to its counterpart in complex I, leading to distinctive architectures for the two respiratory systems despite their largely conserved proton-pumping mechanisms. The Na+-translocating unit, absent in complex I, resembles that found in the Mrp H+/Na+ antiporter and enables hydrogen gas evolution by MBH to establish a Na+ gradient for ATP synthesis near 100°C. MBH also provides insights into Mrp structure and evolution of MBH-based respiratory enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2802654946,"Large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) play widespread roles in epigenetic regulation during multiple differentiation processes, but little is known about their mode of action in cardiac differentiation. Here, we identified the key roles of a lincRNA, termed linc1405, in modulating the core network of cardiac differentiation by functionally interacting with Eomes. Chromatin- and RNA-immunoprecipitation assays showed that exon 2 of linc1405 physically mediates a complex consisting of Eomes, trithorax group (TrxG) subunit WDR5, and histone acetyltransferase GCN5 binding at the enhancer region of Mesp1 gene and activates its expression during cardiac mesoderm specification of embryonic stem cells. Importantly, linc1405 co-localizes with Eomes, WDR5, and GCN5 at the primitive streak, and linc1405 depletion impairs heart development and function in vivo. In summary, linc1405 mediates a Eomes/WDR5/GCN5 complex that contributes to cardiogenesis, highlighting the critical roles of lincRNA-based complexes in the epigenetic regulation of cardiogenesis in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2800059521,"The objective of this study is to obtain population norms and to assess test-retest reliability of EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF for the Indonesian population.A representative sample of 1056 people aged 17-75 years was recruited from the Indonesian general population. We used a multistage stratified quota sampling method with respect to residence, gender, age, education level, religion and ethnicity. Respondents completed EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF with help from an interviewer. Norms data for both instruments were reported. For the test-retest evaluations, a sub-sample of 206 respondents completed both instruments twice.The total sample and test-retest sub-sample were representative of the Indonesian general population. The EQ-5D-5L shows almost perfect agreement between the two tests (Gwet's AC: 0.85-0.99 and percentage agreement: 90-99%) regarding the five dimensions. However, the agreement of EQ-VAS and index scores can be considered as poor (ICC: 0.45 and 0.37 respectively). For the WHOQOL-BREF, ICCs of the four domains were between 0.70 and 0.79, which indicates moderate to good agreement. For EQ-5D-5L, it was shown that female and older respondents had lower EQ-index scores, whilst rural, younger and higher-educated respondents had higher EQ-VAS scores. For WHOQOL-BREF: male, younger, higher-educated, high-income respondents had the highest scores in most of the domains, overall quality of life, and health satisfaction.This study provides representative estimates of self-reported health status and quality of life for the general Indonesian population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF instruments. The descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L and the WHOQOL-BREF have high test-retest reliability while the EQ-VAS and the index score of EQ-5D-5L show poor agreement between the two tests. Our results can be useful to researchers and clinicians who can compare their findings with respect to these concepts with those of the Indonesian general population."
https://openalex.org/W2800446742,"Spontaneous neurotransmitter release (mini) is an important form of Ca2+-dependent synaptic transmission that occurs in the absence of action potentials. A molecular understanding of this process requires an identification of the underlying Ca2+ sensors. Here, we address the roles of the relatively low- and high-affinity Ca2+ sensors, synapotagmin-1 (syt1) and Doc2α/β, respectively. We found that both syt1 and Doc2 regulate minis, but, surprisingly, their relative contributions depend on whether release was from excitatory or inhibitory neurons. Doc2α promoted glutamatergic minis, while Doc2β and syt1 both regulated GABAergic minis. We identified Ca2+ ligand mutations in Doc2 that either disrupted or constitutively activated the regulation of minis. Finally, Ca2+ entry via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels triggered miniature GABA release by activating syt1, but had no effect on Doc2-driven minis. This work reveals an unexpected divergence in the regulation of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory transmission in terms of both Ca2+ sensors and sources."

All four RSPOs have been suggested to potentiate Wnt signaling by binding to three related receptors, i.e. leucine-rich repeat–containing, G protein–coupled receptors 4, 5, and 6 (LGR4/5/6), and then inducing the clearance of two E3 ubiquitin ligases (RNF43 and ZNRF3) that otherwise would ubiquitinate Wnt receptors for degradation. Here, we show that RSPO1–4 have differential dependence on LGRs in potentiating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and that RSPO2 can enhance this pathway without any LGR. LGR4 knockout (LGR4KO) in HEK293 cells completely abrogated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling response to RSPO1 and RSPO4 and strongly impaired the response to RSPO3. RSPO2, however, retained robust activity albeit with decreased potency. Complete rescue of RSPO1–4 activity in LGR4KO cells required the seven-transmembrane domain of LGR4. Furthermore, an RSPO2 mutant with normal binding affinity to ZNRF3 but no or little binding to LGR4 or LGR5 still potentiated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vitro, supported the growth of intestinal organoids ex vivo, and stimulated intestinal crypt growth in vivo. Mechanistically, RSPO2 could increase Wnt receptor levels in the absence of any LGR without affecting ZNRF3 endocytosis and stability. These findings suggest that RSPO1–4 use distinct mechanisms in regulating Wnt and other signaling pathways, which have important implications for understanding the pleiotropic functions of RSPOs and LGRs in both normal and cancer development.

https://openalex.org/W2800880550,"One of the most ambitious endeavors in the field of diabetes technology is non-invasive glucose sensing. In the past decades, a number of different technologies have been assessed, but none of these have found its entry into general clinical use. We report on the development of a table-top confocal Raman spectrometer that was used in the home of patients with diabetes and operated for extended periods of time unsupervised and without recalibration. The system is based on measurement of glucose levels at a 'critical depth' in the skin, specifically in the interstitial fluid located below the stratum corneum but above the underlying adipose tissue layer. The region chosen for routine glucose measurements was the base of the thumb (the thenar). In a small clinical study, 35 patients with diabetes analyzed their interstitial fluid glucose for a period of 60 days using the new critical-depth Raman (CD-Raman) method and levels were correlated to reference capillary blood glucose values using a standard finger-stick and test strip product. The calibration of the CD-Raman system was stable for > 10 days. Measurement performance for glucose levels present at, or below, a depth of ~250μm below the skin surface was comparable to that reported for currently available invasive continuous glucose monitors. In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home."
https://openalex.org/W2799436835,"Approximately 75% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive and are treatable with endocrine therapies, but often patients develop lethal resistant disease. Frequent mutations (10-40%) in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) codons in the gene encoding ERα (ESR1) have been identified, resulting in ligand-independent, constitutively active receptors. In addition, ESR1 chromosomal translocations can occur, resulting in fusion proteins that lack the LBD and are entirely unresponsive to all endocrine treatments. Thus, identifying coactivators that bind to these mutant ERα proteins may offer new therapeutic targets for endocrine-resistant cancer. To define coactivator candidate targets, a proteomics approach was performed profiling proteins recruited to the two most common ERα LBD mutants, Y537S and D538G, and an ESR1-YAP1 fusion protein. These mutants displayed enhanced coactivator interactions as compared to unliganded wild-type ERα. Inhibition of these coactivators decreased the ability of ESR1 mutants to activate transcription and promote breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we have identified specific coactivators that may be useful as targets for endocrine-resistant breast cancers."

The metazoan proteins, centromere protein E (CENP-E) and CENP-F, are components of a fibrous layer of mitotic kinetochores named the corona. Several of their features suggest that CENP-E and CENP-F are paralogs: they are very large (comprising ∼2700 and 3200 residues, respectively), contain abundant predicted coiled-coil structures, are C-terminally prenylated, and are endowed with microtubule-binding sites at their termini. Moreover, CENP-E contains an ATP-hydrolyzing motor domain that promotes microtubule plus end–directed motion. Here, we show that both CENP-E and CENP-F are recruited to mitotic kinetochores independently of the main corona constituent, the Rod/Zwilch/ZW10 (RZZ) complex.

https://openalex.org/W2801120072,"Ramie (Boehmeria nivea L. Gaud) fiber, one of the most important natural fibers, is extracted from stem bark. Continuous cropping is the main obstacle to ramie stem growth and a major cause of reduced yields. Root-associated microbes play crucial roles in plant growth and health. In this study, we investigated differences between microbial communities in the soil of healthy and continuously cropped ramie plants, and sought to identify potential mechanisms whereby these communities could counteract the problems posed by continuous cropping. Paired-end Illumina MiSeq analysis of 16S rRNA and ITS gene amplicons was employed to study bacterial and fungal communities. Long-term monoculture of ramie significantly decreased fiber yields and altered soil microbial communities. Our findings revealed how microbial communities and functional diversity varied according to the planting year and plant health status. Soil bacterial diversity increased with the period of ramie monoculture, whereas no significant differences were observed for fungi. Sequence analyses revealed that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria were the most abundant bacterial phyla. Firmicutes abundance decreased with the period of ramie monoculture and correlated positively with the stem length, stem diameter, and fiber yield. The Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Zygomycota phyla exhibited a significant (P < 0.05) negative correlation with yields during continuous cultivation. Some Actinobacteria members showed reduced microbial diversity, which prevented continuous ramie cropping. Ascomycota, Zygomycota, and Basidiomycota were the main fungal phyla. The relatively high abundance of Bacillus observed in healthy ramie may contribute to disease suppression, thereby promoting ramie growth. In summary, soil weakness and increased disease in ramie plants after long-term continuous cropping can be attributed to changes in soil microbes, a reduction in beneficial microbes, and an accumulation of harmful microbes."

This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from Gliricidia sepium was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p<0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha-1 in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha-1 in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha-1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from Eupatorium adenophorum in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, Ksat and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p>0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm-3 per percent BC added (p<0.001). Ksat and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day-1 and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both Ksat and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p<0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses. Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to Ksat and air capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2799964739,"The kidney maintains the internal milieu by regulating the retention and excretion of proteins, ions, and small molecules. The glomerular podocyte forms the slit diaphragm of the ultrafiltration filter, whose damage leads to progressive kidney failure and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) ion channel is expressed in the podocyte, and mutations in its cytoplasmic domain cause FSGS in humans. In vitro evaluation of disease-causing mutations in TRPC6 has revealed that these genetic alterations result in abnormal ion channel gating. However, the mechanism whereby the cytoplasmic domain modulates TRPC6 function is largely unknown. Here, we report a cryo-EM structure of the cytoplasmic domain of murine TRPC6 at 3.8 Å resolution. The cytoplasmic fold of TRPC6 is characterized by an inverted dome-like chamber pierced by four radial horizontal helices that converge into a vertical coiled-coil at the central axis. Unlike other TRP channels, TRPC6 displays a unique domain swap that occurs at the junction of the horizontal helices and coiled-coil. Multiple FSGS mutations converge at the buried interface between the vertical coiled-coil and the ankyrin repeats, which form the dome, suggesting these regions are critical for allosteric gating modulation. This functionally critical interface is a potential target for drug design. Importantly, dysfunction in other family members leads to learning deficits (TRPC1/4/5) and ataxia (TRPC3). Our data provide a structural framework for the mechanistic investigation of the TRPC family."

Therefore, alleviation of inflammation induced by environmental stimuli is important for disease prevention or treatment. Cereblon (CRBN) functions as a substrate receptor of the cullin-4 RING E3 ligase to mediate protein ubiquitination and degradation. Although it has been reported that CRBN reduces the inflammatory response through its nonenzymatic function, its role as a substrate receptor of the E3 ligase is not explored in mediating this process. Here we used a quantitative proteomics approach to find that the major component of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex, c-Jun, is significantly down-regulated upon CRBN expression. Biochemical approaches further discover that CRBN interacts and partially colocalizes with c-Jun and promotes the formation of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains on c-Jun, enhancing c-Jun degradation. We further reveal that CRBN attenuates the transcriptional activity of the AP-1 complex and reduces the mRNA expression and protein level of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, flow cytometry analyses show that CRBN attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis in differentiated THP-1 cells. Through genetic manipulation and pharmacological inhibition, we uncover a new molecular mechanism by which CRBN regulates the inflammatory response and apoptosis induced by lipopolysaccharide. Our work and previous studies demonstrate that CRBN suppresses the inflammatory response by promoting or inhibiting the ubiquitination of two key molecules at different levels of the inflammatory cascade through its enzymatic function as a substrate receptor and its nonenzymatic function as a protein binding partner."

Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, S. mansoni is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult S. mansoni resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (P < 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult S. mansoni, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile S. mansoni. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no in vitro cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed in silico analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity in vivo by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2795543026,"In recent years, effective treatment of infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii has become challenging due to the ability of the bacterium to acquire or up-regulate antimicrobial resistance determinants. Two component signal transduction systems are known to regulate expression of virulence factors including multidrug efflux pumps. Here, we investigated the role of the AdeRS two component signal transduction system in regulating the AdeAB efflux system, determined whether AdeA and/or AdeB can individually confer antimicrobial resistance, and explored the interplay between pentamidine resistance and growth conditions in A. baumannii ATCC 17978. Results identified that deletion of adeRS affected resistance towards chlorhexidine and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, two previously defined AdeABC substrates, and also identified an 8-fold decrease in resistance to pentamidine. Examination of ΔadeA, ΔadeB and ΔadeAB cells augmented results seen for ΔadeRS and identified a set of dicationic AdeAB substrates. RNA-sequencing of ΔadeRS revealed transcription of 290 genes were ≥2-fold altered compared to the wildtype. Pentamidine shock significantly increased adeA expression in the wildtype, but decreased it in ΔadeRS, implying that AdeRS activates adeAB transcription in ATCC 17978. Investigation under multiple growth conditions, including the use of Biolog phenotypic microarrays, revealed resistance to pentamidine in ATCC 17978 and mutants could be altered by bioavailability of iron or utilization of different carbon sources. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions."

Atherosclerotic tissue has a chronic inflammatory component with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). VSMC of atheromatous plaques have increased autophagy, a mechanism responsible for protein and intracellular organelle degradation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether TNF-α induces phenotype switching of VSMCs and whether this effect depends on autophagy. Rat aortic Vascular smooth A7r5 cell line was used as a model to examine the phenotype switching and autophagy. These cells were stimulated with TNF-α 100 ng/mL. Autophagy was determined by measuring LC3-II and p62 protein levels. Autophagy was inhibited using chloroquine and siRNA Beclin1. Cell dedifferentiation was evaluated by measuring the expression of contractile proteins α-SMA and SM22, extracellular matrix protein osteopontin and type I collagen levels. Cell proliferation was measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay, and migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 was assessed by ELISA. TNF-α induced autophagy as determined by increased LC3-II (1.91±0.21, p<0.001) and decreased p62 (0.86±0.02, p<0.05) when compared to control. Additionally, TNF-α decreased α-SMA (0.74±0.12, p<0.05) and SM22 (0.54±0.01, p<0.01) protein levels. Consequently, TNF-α induced migration (1.25±0.05, p<0.05), proliferation (2.33±0.24, p<0.05), and the secretion of IL-6 (258±53, p<0.01), type I collagen (3.09±0.85, p<0.01) and osteopontin (2.32±0.46, p<0.01). Inhibition of autophagy prevented all the TNF-α-induced phenotypic changes. TNF-α induces phenotype switching in A7r5 cell line by a mechanism that required autophagy.

GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies."

Many systems employ rewired cells for non-native product synthesis, while a few have employed the rewired cells as 'smart' devices with programmable function. Building on the latter, we developed a genetic construct to control and direct bacterial motility towards hydrogen peroxide, one of the body's immune response signaling molecules. A motivation for this work is the creation of cells that can target and autonomously treat disease, the latter signaled by hydrogen peroxide release. Bacteria naturally move towards a variety of molecular cues (e.g., nutrients) in the process of chemotaxis. In this work, we engineered bacteria to recognize and move towards hydrogen peroxide, a non-native chemoattractant and potential toxin. Our system exploits oxyRS, the native oxidative stress regulon of E. coli. We first demonstrated H2O2-mediated upregulation motility regulator, CheZ. Using transwell assays, we showed a two-fold increase in net motility towards H2O2. Then, using a 2D cell tracking system, we quantified bacterial motility descriptors including velocity, % running (of tumble/run motions), and a dynamic net directionality towards the molecular cue. In CheZ mutants, we found that increased H2O2 concentration (0-200 μM) and induction time resulted in increased running speeds, ultimately reaching the native E. coli wild-type speed of ~22 μm/s with a ~45-65% ratio of running to tumbling. Finally, using a microfluidic device with stable H2O2 gradients, we characterized responses and the potential for ""programmed"" directionality towards H2O2 in quiescent fluids. Overall, the synthetic biology framework and tracking analysis in this work will provide a framework for investigating controlled motility of E. coli and other 'smart' probiotics for signal-directed treatment."

However, the role of PGE2 and its receptors in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain is incompletely understood but may help inform strategies for pain management. Here, we sought to define the nociceptive roles of the individual PGE2 receptors (EP1–4) in the SNI model using EP knockout mice. We found that PGE2 levels at the site of injury were increased and that the expression of the terminal synthase for PGE2, cytosolic PGE synthase was up-regulated in resident positive macrophages located within the damaged nerve. Only genetic deletion of the EP3 receptor affected nociceptive behavior and reduced the development of late-stage mechanical allodynia as well as recruitment of immune cells to the injured nerve. Importantly, EP3 activation induced the release of CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), and antagonists against the CCL2 receptor reduced mechanical allodynia in WT but not in EP3 knockout mice. We conclude that selective inhibition of EP3 might present a potential approach for reducing chronic neuropathic pain.

Heating of desi ghee affects its molecular composition, however, the temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be defined safe for cooking /frying where it does not lose much of its molecular composition. Further, the rise in temperature induces prominent spectral variations which confirm the deterioration of valuable vitamins, isomers of CLA and chlorophyll contents.

In order to classify heated samples at different temperatures, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on heated and non-heated ghee samples that further elucidated the temperature effects."
https://openalex.org/W2799786091,"Several patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking. Stride-to-stride variability of temporal gait parameters was also estimated.Walking speed, cadence or stride length were not different between PD and HS during linear walking. Speed, cadence and stride length diminished during curved walking in both groups, stride length more in PD than HS. In PD compared to HS, the stride length-cadence relationship was altered during curved walking. Duration of the double-support phase was also increased during curved walking, as was variability of the single support, swing phase and double support phase.The spatio-temporal gait pattern and variability are significantly modified in well-treated, high-functioning patients with PD walking along circular trajectories, even when they exhibit no changes in speed in straight-line walking. The increased variability of the gait phases during curved walking is an identifying characteristic of PD. We discuss our findings in term of interplay between control of balance and of locomotor progression: the former is challenged by curved trajectories even in high-functioning patients, while the latter may not be critically affected."

We have shown that N. gonorrhoeae suppresses the capacity of antigen-presenting cells to induce CD4+ T cell proliferation. In this study, we sought to determine the gonococcal factors involved in this adaptive immune suppression. We show that suppression of the capacity of antigen-pulsed dendritic cells to induce T cell proliferation is recapitulated by administration of a high-molecular-weight fraction of conditioned medium from N. gonorrhoeae cultures, which includes outer membrane vesicles that are shed during growth of the bacteria.

Gonorrhea, the urethritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, has been recognized as a human infection for thousands of years and, to date, remains one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial infections, with over 78 million new cases reported worldwide in 2012 (1.Newman L.

Studies of gonococcal infections in the female mouse infection model have shown that N. gonorrhoeae elicits T helper type 17 (Th17) responses through the induction of host transforming growth factor β. Further, the Th17 response drives induction of localized inflammation, including recruitment of host neutrophils (to which N. gonorrhoeae is relatively resistant) (12.Liu Y. Russell M.W.

Our previous studies have shown that N. gonorrhoeae suppresses the capacity of dendritic cells, professional antigen-presenting cells that play a key role in promoting pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses, to stimulate antigen-specific T cell proliferation (14.Zhu W. Ventevogel M.S. Knilans K.J. Anderson J.E. Oldach L.M. McKinnon K.P. Hobbs M.M. Sempowski G.D. Duncan J.A. Neisseria gonorrhoeae suppresses dendritic cell-induced, antigen-dependent CD4 T cell proliferation.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 (22844448): e4126010.1371/journal.pone.0041260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). N. gonorrhoeae causes this suppression in part by promoting secretion of inhibitory factors, such as IL-10, and expression of cell-autonomous factors, including up-regulation of programmed death ligand 1, but the key molecular component(s) of N. gonorrhoeae that engage in this process were not identified. In this study, we determined that gonococcus-conditioned medium carries factors that recapitulate the suppression of dendritic cell–induced T cell proliferation observed with whole bacteria. We show that properly folded, recombinant PorB, a major protein component found in conditioned medium, has similar suppressive properties. Surprisingly, prior studies of PorB from N. gonorrhoeae and other Neisseria species have demonstrated that the protein can act as an immune-stimulating adjunct. We further demonstrate that the stimulatory properties of PorB result from a loss of immune-suppressive activity as a consequence of the loss of the properly folded PorB protein structure that occurs when detergent is removed from this integral membrane protein. Taken together, our results suggest that, although the native PorB trimer from N. gonorrhoeae can stimulate signaling in some immune cells through activation of Toll-like receptor 2, PorB overcomes this stimulation by profoundly inhibiting dendritic cell–promoted T cell proliferation when presented to cells in its native, properly folded state. To determine whether N. gonorrhoeae releases factors responsible for inhibition of antigen-pulsed dendritic cell–induced T cell proliferation, conditioned medium from N. gonorrhoeae cultures (Ng-CM) or live N. gonorrhoeae was added to dendritic cells during ovalbumin (OVA) exposure for 24 h, and then the dendritic cells were washed and co-cultured with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)–labeled T cells from OT-II mice. After 7 days, T cell proliferation in each co-culture was evaluated by quantifying the dilution of CFSE fluorescence. Treatment of dendritic cells with either N. gonorrhoeae or Ng-CM resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of proliferation of co-cultured T cells compared with OVA-treated dendritic cells (Fig. 1, A–C). Ng-CM also inhibited the capacity of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells to induce proliferation of allogeneic T lymphocytes (Fig. 1, D and E), demonstrating that Ng-CM-mediated suppression occurs in both human and mouse dendritic cells. To further characterize the components released from N. gonorrhoeae that are responsible for inhibition of T cell proliferation, Ng-CM was subjected to ultrafiltration through a 100-kDa cutoff filter, and the retentate was restored to its original volume by addition of Graver–Wade medium (GWM) (15.Wade J.J. Graver M.A. A fully defined, clear and protein-free liquid medium permitting dense growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from very low inocula.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 273 (17559396): 35-3710.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00776.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The filtrate and retentate fractions were then assessed for their capacity to inhibit dendritic cell–induced T cell proliferation. The 100-kDa retentate from Ng-CM demonstrated inhibition of T cell proliferation that was indistinguishable from unfiltered Ng-CM, whereas the 100-kDa filtrate from Ng-CM exhibited no detectable inhibition of T cell proliferation (Fig. 2, A and B). Although N. gonorrhoeae does not secrete known protein exotoxins, N. gonorrhoeae and other pathogenic Neisseria species prolifically shed outer membrane vesicles (OMVs, also called membrane blebs) into the environment during growth (16.Ellis T.N. Kuehn M.J. Virulence and immunomodulatory roles of bacterial outer membrane vesicles.Microbiol Mol. Biol.

Ng-CM, Ng-CM 100-kDa filtrate, and Ng-CM 100-kDa retentate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, which revealed that the majority of proteins present in Ng-CM were retained by the 100-kDa filter (Fig. S1A). The finding that the majority of the proteins found in Ng-CM and the inhibitory factor are retained by a 100-kDa filter suggests that the immunosuppressive effect of Ng-CM is due to OMVs or proteins in the OMVs. OMVs from N. gonorrhoeae contain large quantities of LOS as well as outer membrane proteins, primarily PorB (17.Post D.M. Zhang D. Eastvold J.S. Teghanemt A. Gibson B.W. Weiss J.P.

We therefore sought to determine whether LOS or gonococcal proteins abundant in OMVs present in Ng-CM were responsible for inducing inhibition of dendritic cell–directed, OVA-induced T cell proliferation. The amount of LOS in Ng-CM was estimated following SDS-PAGE and silver staining by comparing the staining intensities to a titration series of purified LOS (Fig. S1A). The quantity of Ng-CM that conferred maximal inhibition of dendritic cell–mediated T cell proliferation (25 μl, Fig. 1C) was estimated to contain ∼100 ng of LOS. When dendritic cells were treated with 100 ng of purified LOS in the presence of OVA prior to co-culture with CD4+ T cells, no inhibition of T cell proliferation was observed (Fig. S1B). When 10-fold more purified LOS (1 μg) was used, a slight inhibition of T cell proliferation was observed, but this trend did not meet statistical significance (Fig. S1C). These data indicate that purified LOS was unable to recapitulate the inhibition of dendritic cell-induced T cell proliferation that was observed with Ng-CM and suggest that outer membrane proteins may be responsible for the inhibition. N. gonorrhoeae porin (PorB) is the most abundant gonococcal protein in both outer membranes and OMVs, constituting ∼50% of the total protein content (19.Johnston K.H. Gotschlich E.C.

N. gonorrhoeae has two PorB serotypes, PorB1A and PorB1B; the strain used in these experiments, FA1090, expresses the PorB1B serotype. As anticipated, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that PorB1B was present in Ng-CM and that all detectable PorB1B was retained by the 100-kDa cut-off filter (Fig. 3A). To examine the effects of PorB1B on dendritic cell–mediated T cell proliferation, PorB1B lacking its signal sequence and containing a N-terminal hexahistidine tag (HT) followed by a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site was expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli and refolded into an active state in the presence of the detergent LDAO as described under “Experimental procedures.” For some experiments, the hexahistidine tag was removed using tobacco etch virus protease (Fig. 3B). Refolded HT-PorB1B and PorB1B in LDAO micelles were highly pure and eluted as homogenous single peaks in size exclusion chromatography. The estimated molecular mass of purified, refolded PorB1B was ∼250 kDa (Fig. 3C), consistent with two PorB trimers (∼114 kDa), the known tertiary structure for native N. gonorrhoeae PorB1B, and an LDAO detergent micelle (∼25 kDa).

The addition of purified PorB1B (50 μg/ml) to dendritic cells during OVA exposure led to profound inhibition of T cell proliferation in our co-culture system, recapitulating the effects observed with live N. gonorrhoeae treatment (Figs. 4, A and B). The addition of an equivalent volume of LDAO-containing buffer, the vehicle for PorB1B, caused a small, reproducible decrease in dendritic cell–induced T cell proliferation, but this decrease was not statistically significant (Fig. S2). The PorB1B preparations were found to have low levels of endotoxin contamination (between 1.5 and 6 endotoxin units/mg of protein), which, at the highest amount of PorB1B added, corresponds to a maximum concentration of ∼ 2.5 ng of E. coli LPS/ml in the dendritic cell culture. To ensure that E. coli LPS contamination of the recombinant PorB1B was not responsible for the PorB1B-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation observed, OVA-pulsed dendritic cells were exposed to E. coli LPS at concentrations between 1 and 100 ng/ml and assayed for the ability to stimulate OT-II T cell proliferation. E. coli LPS at these concentrations demonstrated no detectable effect on OVA-pulsed dendritic cell–induced T cell proliferation (Fig. S3). Although these experiments demonstrated an inhibitory effect on dendritic cell–mediated T cell proliferation when recombinant PorB1B was added to the culture, it did so at concentrations much higher than the levels of PorB1B present in either the Ng-CM or live gonococci that produced an equivalent inhibitory effect (data not shown). However, because PorB1B is an integral membrane protein, a substantial percentage of the PorB1B is likely to aggregate or bind to the tissue culture plate when the protein is diluted from its detergent-containing buffer into cell culture medium. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the amounts of dendritic cell-associated PorB1B were similar between cells treated with recombinant purified PorB1B and those treated with live N. gonorrhoeae by performing immunoblot analysis of the dendritic cells prior to their use in the co-culture T cell proliferation assay. The amount of PorB1B associated with dendritic cells after treatment with 50 μg/ml of purified PorB1B was similar to that observed in cells treated with live N. gonorrhoeae at an m.o.i. of 10 (Fig. 4C). We observed more cell-associated PorB1B in cells treated with 5 μg/ml of recombinant porin than with live N. gonorrhoeae at an m.o.i. of 1, even though the former caused little inhibition, whereas the latter decreases T cell proliferation by over 50%. These data indicate that N. gonorrhoeae likely produces additional inhibitory factors that complicate the comparison between live bacteria and a single purified protein. One such factor is the inhibitory interleukin IL-10, which has been shown to be secreted in response to live N. gonorrhoeae (10.Chen T. Bolland S. Chen I. Parker J. Pantelic M. Grunert F. Zimmermann W. The CGM1a (CEACAM3/CD66d)-mediated phagocytic pathway of Neisseria gonorrhoeae expressing opacity proteins is also the pathway to cell death.J. Biol.

To further assess the loss of the suppressive effect of PorB1B at concentrations lower than 50 μg/ml, we tested the capacity of PorB1B to inhibit dendritic cell–induced T cell proliferation at three different subcytolytic concentrations of LDAO detergent. We observed minor but consistent concentration-dependent decreases in proliferation with detergent alone (∼30% at the highest concentration of detergent). Although complete suppression of T cell proliferation was observed with 50 μg/ml PorB1B regardless of the detergent concentration, we also observed that, as the concentration of LDAO was increased, the inhibitory potency of PorB1B increased (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that, when PorB1B loses association with detergent micelles and presumably loses its native, membrane-associated trimeric structure, it also loses the capacity to inhibit dendritic cell–induced T cell proliferation. To ensure that PorB1B was not simply competing with OVA for proteolytic digestion or loading into antigen-presenting MHC molecules, we tested whether other proteins, either BSA or an isolated recombinant gonococcal protein (the transcriptional regulator GdhR) expressed in Escherichia coli, could inhibit dendritic cell–induced CD4 T cell proliferation. In contrast to recombinant PorB1B, neither protein impacted the capacity of OVA-pulsed dendritic cells to induce OT-II T cell proliferation (Fig. 4E) (25.Rouquette-Loughlin C.E. Zalucki Y.M.

Because N. gonorrhoeae is an exclusive human pathogen, we also assessed whether addition of PorB1B would inhibit T cell proliferation in a model of human dendritic cell–induced T cell proliferation. As shown previously for treatment with live N. gonorrhoeae and with Ng-CM (Fig. 1, D and E), T cell proliferation induced by co-culture with allogeneic dendritic cells was inhibited when the dendritic cells were first treated with recombinant PorB1B (Fig. 4, F and G). Moreover, neither BSA nor GdhR were capable of inhibiting T cell proliferation when added at the same concentration of purified PorB1b. Purified Neisseria PorB proteins have been shown previously to have immunostimulatory activity in both cultured immune cells and when injected into whole animals (23.Massari P. Henneke P. Ho Y.

In these reports, the protein, which was either purified from N. gonorrhoeae or refolded from E. coli inclusion bodies, had the detergent used to solubilized this integral membrane protein removed through a process of ethanol precipitation and dialysis during the final steps of preparation. The resulting detergent-free protein aggregates have been termed PorB “proteosomes” (29.Massari P. King C.A. MacLeod H. Wetzler L.M. Improved purification of native meningococcal porin PorB and studies on its structure/function.Protein Expr.

We sought to test whether the suppressive effect on dendritic cell-induced T cell proliferation we observed with PorB1B treatment of dendritic cells was independent of the folded structure of PorB1B. Unfolded PorB1B was prepared by dialysis into PBS of urea-solubilized recombinant PorB1B inclusion bodies, whereas PorB1B proteosomes were prepared from our refolded, detergent-containing PorB1B preparations by ethanol precipitation and dialysis using the methods of Massari et al. (29.Massari P. King C.A. MacLeod H. Wetzler L.M. Improved purification of native meningococcal porin PorB and studies on its structure/function.Protein Expr.

Dynamic light scattering performed on refolded and proteosome preparations of recombinant PorB1B clearly demonstrated that refolded PorB1B in LDAO micelles exists as a single homogenous species with an estimated Stokes radius of 10 nm, whereas proteosome PorB1B preparations without detergent formed much larger particles with a Stokes radius of ∼700 nm (Fig. 5B). Based on the crystal structure of Neisseria meningitidis PorB, the size estimate generated by dynamic light scattering for the refolded protein is consistent with two PorB1B trimers sitting within an LDAO micelle, which is also consistent with estimates generated by retention time in size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5C). Each of these protein preparations resulted in highly purified PorB1B, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5C). These preparations were then tested for their effects on OVA-pulsed dendritic cell stimulation of OT-II T cell proliferation. As we had observed previously, refolded PorB1B demonstrated suppression of T cell proliferation, but neither the unfolded nor the proteosome preparation of PorB1B suppressed T cell proliferation in this system (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that the suppressive properties of PorB are disrupted when the structure of the protein is not maintained. Neisseria PorB proteins have been shown previously to activate host TLR2 (28.Singleton T.E. Massari P. Wetzler L.M. Neisserial porin-induced dendritic cell activation is MyD88 and TLR2 dependent.J.

https://openalex.org/W2801525587,"Fisheries management is most effective when based on scientific estimates of sustainable fishing rates. While some simple approaches allow estimation of harvest limits, more data-intensive stock assessments are generally required to evaluate the stock’s biomass and fishing rates relative to sustainable levels. Here we evaluate how stock characteristics relate to the rate of new assessments in the United States. Using a statistical model based on time-to-event analysis and 569 coastal marine fish and invertebrate stocks landed in commercial fisheries, we quantify the impact of region, habitat, life-history, and economic factors on the annual probability of being assessed. Although the majority of landings come from assessed stocks in all regions, less than half of the regionally-landed species currently have been assessed. As expected, our time-to-event model identified landed tonnage and ex-vessel price as the dominant factors determining increased rates of new assessments. However, we also found that after controlling for landings and price, there has been a consistent bias towards assessing larger-bodied species. A number of vulnerable groups such as rockfishes (Scorpaeniformes) and groundsharks (Carcharhiniformes) have a relatively high annual probability of being assessed after controlling for their relatively small tonnage and low price. Due to relatively low landed tonnage and price of species that are currently unassessed, our model suggests that the number of assessed stocks will increase more slowly in future decades."

https://openalex.org/W2800310990,"Melanoma is among the most aggressive and treatment-resistant human cancers. Aberrant histone H3 methylation at Lys 9 (H3K9) correlates with carcinogenic gene silencing, but the significance of suppressor of variegation 3–9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1), an H3K9-specific methyltransferase, in melanoma initiation and progression remains unclear. Here, we show that SUV39H1-mediated H3K9 trimethylation facilitates retinoblastoma (RB)1 promoter CpG island methylation by interacting with DNA methyltransferase 3A and decreasing RB mRNA and protein in melanoma cells. Reduced RB abundance, in turn, impairs E2F1 transcriptional inhibition, leading to increased peptidyl-prolyl cis- trans isomerase never-in-mitosis A (NIMA)-interacting 1 (PIN1) levels, human keratinocyte neoplastic cell transformation, and melanoma tumorigenesis via enhanced rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma 1(RAF1)-MEK-ERK signaling pathway activation. In a synergistic model with B16-F1 murine melanoma cells, SUV39H1 and PIN1 overexpression increased melanoma growth, which was abrogated by their inhibition in SUV39H1-overexpressing B16-F1 mice. SUV39H1 also positively correlated with PIN1 expression in human melanoma.

V-ATPase is regulated by reversible disassembly into autoinhibited V1-ATPase and Vo proton channel sectors. An important player in V-ATPase regulation is subunit H, which binds at the interface of V1 and Vo. H is required for MgATPase activity in holo-V-ATPase but also for stabilizing the MgADP-inhibited state in membrane-detached V1. However, how H fulfills these two functions is poorly understood. To characterize the H–V1 interaction and its role in reversible disassembly, we determined binding affinities of full-length H and its N-terminal domain (HNT) for an isolated heterodimer of subunits E and G (EG), the N-terminal domain of subunit a (aNT), and V1 lacking subunit H (V1ΔH). Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and biolayer interferometry (BLI), we show that HNT binds EG with moderate affinity, that full-length H binds aNT weakly, and that both H and HNT bind V1ΔH with high affinity. We also found that only one molecule of HNT binds V1ΔH with high affinity, suggesting conformational asymmetry of the three EG heterodimers in V1ΔH. Moreover, MgATP hydrolysis–driven conformational changes in V1 destabilized the interaction of H or HNT with V1ΔH, suggesting an interplay between MgADP inhibition and subunit H.

ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic A3B3 hexamer is coupled to rotation of the proteolipid ring (c8c′c″) via a central rotor made of subunits D, F, and d with concurrent proton translocation at the interface of the proteolipid ring and the C-terminal domain of subunit a (aCT). During rotary catalysis, the motor is stabilized by a peripheral stator complex consisting of three peripheral stalks constituted by heterodimers of subunits E and G (hereafter referred to as EG1–3) that connect the A3B3 hexamer to the N-terminal domain of the membrane-bound a subunit (aNT) via the single-copy “collar” subunits H and C (19Zhang Z.

Studies in yeast have shown that, during enzyme disassembly, subunit C is released into the cytosol by an unknown mechanism and reincorporated during reassembly (27Kane P.M.

Because of regulation of the V-ATPase by reversible disassembly, the peripheral stator subunit interactions at the V1–Vo interface draw particular attention as they must be sufficiently strong to withstand the torque generated during ATP hydrolysis, but at the same time they must be vulnerable enough to allow breaking on a timescale for reversible disassembly to occur efficiently. We previously characterized the interaction of the collar subunit C with EG and aNT and found that although the head domain of C (Chead) binds EG with high affinity (Chead–EG3; see Fig. 1A), its foot domain (Cfoot) and EG both interact weakly with aNT, resulting in a high-avidity ternary interface (EG2–aNT–Cfoot) in holo-V-ATPase (33Oot R.A.

Another collar subunit at the V1–Vo interface is subunit H, and although deletion of C prevents stable assembly of V1 and Vo (35Curtis K.K. Francis S.A. Oluwatosin Y. Kane P.M.

Moreover, although C is released into the cytosol upon disassembly of V1Vo, H remains stably associated with V1 (Fig. 1B). The crystal structure of H revealed that it consists of a larger N-terminal (HNT) and smaller C-terminal domain (HCT) connected by a short linker (38Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Crystal structure of the regulatory subunit H of the V-type ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Previous functional characterization of HNT and HCT suggested that, although HNT is required for MgATPase activity in V1Vo, HCT has a dual function in that it is required for both coupling of V1's ATPase activity to proton pumping in V1Vo (37Liu M. Tarsio M. Charsky C.M. Kane P.M. Structural and functional separation of the N- and C-terminal domains of the yeast V-ATPase subunit H.J. Biol.

Ohira M. Liu M. Cobb E. Kane P.M. Subunit interactions and requirements for inhibition of the yeast V1-ATPase.J. Biol.

The dual role and functional separation of HNT and HCT along with differences in regulatory function compared with C are not well understood and prompted the analyses of the interactions of H, HNT, and HCT with its binding partners in V1 and Vo. We therefore used recombinant H, HNT, and HCT for quantification of their interactions with purified EG, aNT, and V1 lacking subunit H (V1ΔH) using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and biolayer interferometry (BLI). We found that HNT binds no more than one of the three EGs on V1ΔH and that the affinity of this interaction is ∼40-fold higher than that between HNT and isolated EG, suggesting that HNT prefers a particular conformation of EG on V1. We further found that full-length H interacts with V1ΔH with an ∼70-fold higher affinity than HNT, indicative of a significant contribution of HCT to the binding energy. Furthermore, we show that MgATP hydrolysis–driven conformational changes in the catalytic A/B pairs, the central rotor (DF), and the peripheral stalks (EG) destabilize the V1–H interaction until inhibitory MgADP is trapped in a catalytic site. The findings are discussed in context of the mechanism of V-ATPase regulation by reversible disassembly. To understand the role of the V1–Vo interface in the mechanism of reversible disassembly, our laboratory has previously characterized the interactions among Chead, Cfoot, EG, and aNT (33Oot R.A. Wilkens S. Domain characterization and interaction of the yeast vacuolar ATPase subunit C with the peripheral stator stalk subunits E and G.J. Biol.

Pulldown and yeast two-hybrid assays have shown that H is able to bind the N-terminal region of subunit E (40Lu M. Vergara S. Zhang L. Holliday L.S. Aris J. Gluck S.L.

In addition, EM and crystal structures of V1Vo and V1, respectively, show HNT bound to one of the three EG peripheral stalks (EG1; see Fig. 2, A and B), whereas HCT is seen to either rest on the coiled-coil middle domain of aNT (in V1Vo; Fig. 2A) or at the bottom of the A3B3 hexamer (in autoinhibited V1) (Fig. 2B) (21Zhao J. Benlekbir S. Rubinstein J.L.

To analyze the interactions of H within the enzyme in more detail, we expressed H, HNT, and HCT separately and quantified their interactions with recombinant EG, aNT, and V1ΔH purified from yeast. Full-length H, HNT (residues 1–354), HCT (residues 352–478), and aNT (residues 1–372) were expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal fusions with maltose-binding protein (MBP). After amylose affinity capture, fusions were cleaved, and MBP was removed by ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, resulting in purified subunits and subunit domains (Fig. 3A). All proteins eluted near their expected molecular masses on size exclusion chromatography except aNT(1–372), which exists in a dimer–monomer equilibrium as described previously (26Couoh-Cardel S. Milgrom E. Wilkens S. Affinity purification and structural features of the yeast vacuolar ATPase Vo membrane sector.J. Biol.

Consistent with available structural information, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed a high degree of α-helical secondary structure, suggesting proper folding of the recombinant polypeptides (Fig. 3D). We previously established that binding of C (or Chead) to isolated EG occurs with high affinity and that the interaction greatly stabilizes EG (33Oot R.A. Wilkens S. Domain characterization and interaction of the yeast vacuolar ATPase subunit C with the peripheral stator stalk subunits E and G.J. Biol.

To further characterize the interactions at the V1–Vo interface, we set out to determine the affinity of the HNT–EG interaction using ITC. Titration of HNT into EG was exothermic, and the binding curve was fit to a single-binding-site model, revealing a Kd of the interaction of 187 nm. The binding enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) were −8 kcal/mol and 2.5 cal/(mol·K), respectively, with a concomitant free energy change (ΔG) of ∼−36 kJ/mol (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the ITC titration, size exclusion chromatography of a mixture of EG and an excess of HNT resulted in the formation of a ternary HNT–EG complex (Fig. 4, B and C), and taken together, the data show that HNT forms a stable complex with the EG heterodimer. Previously, we found that the EG's N-terminal right-handed coiled coil is thermally labile with a Tm of ∼25 °C (Fig. 4D, blue trace) (29Trombetta E.S. Ebersold M. Garrett W. Pypaert M. Mellman I. Activation of lysosomal function during dendritic cell maturation.Science. 2003; 299 (12610307): 1400-140310.1126/science.1080106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and that the Tm of EG is increased by about 10 °C upon complex formation with C(head) (33Oot R.A. Wilkens S. Domain characterization and interaction of the yeast vacuolar ATPase subunit C with the peripheral stator stalk subunits E and G.J. Biol.

To test whether HNT binding has a similar stabilizing effect on EG, thermal unfolding of the individual proteins and EGHNT complex was monitored by recording the CD signal at 222 nm as a function of temperature. The data show that isolated HNT unfolds with an apparent Tm of ∼63 °C (Fig. 4D, green trace). The thermal unfolding curve of the EGHNT complex showed two transitions, one at 25 °C and one at 64 °C, suggesting that the stability of EG is not increased upon HNT binding (Fig. 4D, black trace). Moreover, as also shown previously (33Oot R.A. Wilkens S. Domain characterization and interaction of the yeast vacuolar ATPase subunit C with the peripheral stator stalk subunits E and G.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20529855): 24654-2466410.1074/jbc.M110.136960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), isolated EG heterodimer dissociates during native agarose gel electrophoresis, whereas in presence of Chead the three proteins migrate as a heterotrimeric complex in the electric field. However, consistent with the thermal unfolding data, a complex of EGHNT did not comigrate on the native gel but ran as three separate species (Fig. 4E). Therefore, although both Chead and HNT form a stable complex with EG, the nature of the two interactions are strikingly different. Prior work from our laboratory has shown that the EG2–aNT–Cfoot junction at the V1–Vo interface (Fig. 1A) is formed by multiple low-affinity interactions, and we reasoned that the sum of these interactions provides a high-avidity binding site between V1 and Vo that could be targeted for regulated disassembly (34Oot R.A. Wilkens S. Subunit interactions at the V1-Vo interface in yeast vacuolar ATPase.J. Biol.

Another interaction that is seen in EM reconstructions of the intact V-ATPase, and that must be broken and reformed during reversible disassembly, is between H and aNT (Figs. 1A and 2A). To estimate the affinity between H and aNT, we performed ITC experiments by titrating H into aNT(1–372) (Fig. 4F). Subtracting the heat generated from diluting H into buffer from the heat generated from titrating H into aNT(1–372) revealed a weak endothermic binding reaction between the two proteins. Fitting the data to a one-site binding model revealed a Kd of 135 μm and ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG values of 4 kcal/mol, 36.1 cal/(mol·K), and −26 kJ/mol, respectively. Consistent with our ITC data, a mixture of H and aNT eluted at the same volumes as the in"
https://openalex.org/W2800942801,"Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancer-related skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq."

Previous studies have shown that hepatic LRP1 deficiency exacerbates palmitate-induced steatosis and toxicity in vitro and also promotes high-fat diet–induced hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in vivo. The current study examined the impact of liver-specific LRP1 deficiency on disease progression to steatohepatitis. hLrp1+/+ mice with normal LRP1 expression and hLrp1−/− mice with hepatocyte-specific LRP1 inactivation were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet for 16 weeks. Plasma lipid levels and body weights were similar between both groups. However, the hLrp1−/− mice displayed significant increases in liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis compared with the hLrp1+/+ mice. Hepatocyte cell size, liver weight, and cell death, as measured by serum alanine aminotransferase levels, were also significantly increased in hLrp1−/− mice. The accelerated liver pathology observed in HFHC-fed hLrp1−/− mice was associated with reduced expression of cholesterol excretion and bile acid synthesis genes, leading to elevated immune cell infiltration and inflammation. Additional in vitro studies revealed that cholesterol loading induced significantly higher expression of genes responsible for hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrosis in hLrp1−/− hepatocytes than in hLrp1+/+ hepatocytes. These results indicate that hepatic LRP1 deficiency accelerates liver disease progression by increasing hepatocyte death, thereby causing inflammation and increasing sensitivity to cholesterol-induced pro-fibrotic gene expression to promote steatohepatitis.

https://openalex.org/W2799986840,"Activation of IκB kinase β (IKKβ) is a central event in the NF-κB–mediated canonical pro-inflammatory pathway. Numerous studies have reported that oligomerization-mediated trans autophosphorylation of IKKβ is indispensable for its phosphorylation, leading to its activation and IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of substrates such as IκB proteins. Moreover, IKKβ's interaction with the NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO) is necessary for IKKβ activation. Interestingly, some viruses encode virulence factors that target IKKβ to inhibit NF-κB–mediated antiviral immune responses. One of these factors is the vaccinia viral protein B14, which directly interacts with and inhibits IKKβ. Here we mapped the interaction interface on the B14 and IKKβ proteins. We observed that B14 binds to the junction of the kinase domain (KD) and scaffold and dimerization domain (SDD) of IKKβ. Molecular docking analyses identified key interface residues in both IKKβ and B14 that were further confirmed by mutational studies to promote binding of the two proteins. During trans autophosphorylation of protein kinases in the IKK complex, the activation segments of neighboring kinases need to transiently interact with each other's active sites, and we found that the B14–IKKβ interaction sterically hinders direct contact between the kinase domains of IKKβ in the IKK complex, containing IKKβ, IKKα, and NEMO in human cells. We conclude that binding of B14 to IKKβ prevents IKKβ trans autophosphorylation and activation, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling.

Molecular docking analyses identified key interface residues in both IKKβ and B14 that were further confirmed by mutational studies to promote binding of the two proteins. During trans autophosphorylation of protein kinases in the IKK complex, the activation segments of neighboring kinases need to transiently interact with each other's active sites, and we found that the B14–IKKβ interaction sterically hinders direct contact between the kinase domains of IKKβ in the IKK complex, containing IKKβ, IKKα, and NEMO in human cells. We conclude that binding of B14 to IKKβ prevents IKKβ trans autophosphorylation and activation, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling. Our study provides critical structural and mechanistic information for the design of potential therapeutic agents to target IKKβ activation for the management of inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2800456323,"Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha(-1) (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013-2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0-60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (>73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (>47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha-1) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers. The differences observed with the minirhizotron method were clearer than those observed with the soil coring method."

https://openalex.org/W2802106745,"In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference."
https://openalex.org/W2801996251,"Objective Prescribing individualized moderate exercise intensity is a useful method to reach positive effects on health status in obese adults. This study aimed to establish a practical reference equation to estimate the heart rate (HR) at individual ventilatory threshold (IVT) (HRIVT). Methods One hundred sixty-one obese subjects were clinically evaluated and characterized by anthropometric and body composition. Participants performed the six-minute walking test (6-MWT) and the cardiopulmonary exercise test to assess IVT. Multiple regression analysis for HRIVT, including 6-MWT, anthropometric, and body composition parameters, as independent variables, was performed for both gender separately. A cross-validation study was also performed to determine the accuracy of the prediction equation. Results Whereas HRIVT was not significantly different between males (121.5±18.3 bpm) and females (117.6±17.1 bpm), it differently correlated with physical and performance parameters. Therefore, two sex-specific equations were developed including 6-MWTHR and HRrest (R2 = 0.69 and 0.65 and root mean square errors of 8.8 and 10.1 bpm for females and males, respectively). Conclusion In conclusion, in female and male obese adults, the 6-MWT might be used to predict HR at IVT. These outcomes are useful to prescribe optimal physical activity intensity when gold standard methods (e.g. gas exchange analysis) are unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W2802306167,"Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica is a zoonotic pathogen with critical importance in animal and public health. The persistence of Salmonella on farms affects animal productivity and health, and represents a risk for food safety. The intestinal microbiota plays a fundamental role in the colonization and invasion of this ubiquitous microorganism. To overcome the colonization resistance imparted by the gut microbiome, Salmonella uses invasion strategies and the host inflammatory response to survive, proliferate, and establish infections with diverse clinical manifestations. Cattle serve as reservoirs of Salmonella, and periparturient cows have high prevalence of Salmonella shedding; however, little is known about the association between the gut microbiome and the onset of Salmonella shedding during the periparturient period. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the association between changes in bacterial communities and the onset of Salmonella shedding in cattle approaching parturition. In a prospective cohort study, fecal samples from 98 dairy cows originating from four different farms were collected at four time points relative to calving (-3 wks, -1 wk, +1 wk, +3 wks). All 392 samples were cultured for Salmonella. Sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina platform was completed to evaluate the fecal microbiome in a selected sample subset. Analyses of microbial composition, diversity, and structure were performed according to time points, farm, and Salmonella onset status. Individual cow fecal microbiomes, predominated by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, and Proteobacteria phyla, significantly changed before and after parturition. Microbial communities from different farms were distinguishable based on multivariate analysis. Although there were significant differences in some bacterial taxa between Salmonella positive and negative samples, our results did not identify differences in the fecal microbial diversity or structure for cows with and without the onset of Salmonella shedding. These data suggest that determinants other than the significant changes in the fecal microbiome influence the periparturient onset of Salmonella shedding in dairy cattle."

https://openalex.org/W2801560297,"Background Calcifications within the hippocampus were recently described for the first time on computed tomography (CT). These calcifications appeared in patients older than 50 years, the prevalence increases with age and they may be associated with cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the histological basis (the presence, severity and location) of these CT-detected hippocampal calcifications of post-mortem brains. Methods CT scans of seven post-mortem brains were scored for the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of hippocampal calcification. After this, samples from nine hippocampi (bilateral in two brains, unilateral in five brains) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to indicate the cytoarchitecture, with Elastica van Gieson to analyse the elastic connective tissue of the vessel walls and with von Kossa for detection of calcium. Results In four brains (six hippocampi), calcifications were both found on CT and in corresponding histology. In three brains (three hippocampi), calcifications were absent on CT and corresponding histology. In histology, mild calcifications were located in the tail and severe calcifications involved the tail, body and sometimes the head of the hippocampus. The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1. Conclusions In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2802524088,"Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been suggested to reflect the tumor grades of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs); i.e., it can be used as a biomarker to predict the patients' prognosis. To verify its feasibility as a biomarker, the present study sought to determine how the ADC values of HCC are affected by a tumor's histopathologic grade and arterial vascularity.From 131 consecutive patients, 141 surgically resected HCCs (16 well-differentiated [wd-HCCs], 83 moderately-differentiated [md-HCCs], and 42 poorly-differentiated HCCs [pd-HCCs]) were subjected to a comparison of the tumors' arterial vascularity (non-, slightly-, or markedly-hypervascular) determined on dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the ADC was measured retrospectively.The pd-HCCs (1.05±0.16 × 10-3 mm2/s) had a significantly lower ADC than md-HCCs (1.16±0.21 × 10-3 mm2/s; p = 0.010), but there was no significant difference compared to wd-HCCs (1.11±0.18 × 10-3 mm2/s; p = 0.968). The mean ADC was significantly higher in markedly hypervascular lesions (1.20±0.20 × 10-3 mm2/s) than in nonhypervascular lesions (0.95±0.14 × 10-3mm2/s; p<0.001) or slightly hypervascular lesions (1.04±0.15 × 10-3mm2/s; p<0.001). The ADC values and arterial vascularity were significantly correlated in wd-HCCs (p = 0.005) and md-HCCs (p<0.001). The mean ADC of pd-HCCs was significantly lower than those of other lesions, even in the markedly hypervascular lesion subgroup (p = 0.020).Although pd-HCC constantly shows low ADCs regardless of arterial vascularities, ADCs cannot stably stratify histopathologic tumor grades due to the variable features of wd-HCCs; and the ADC should be used with caution as a tumor biomarker of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2801092707,"The absence of a histidine biosynthesis pathway in humans, coupled with histidine essentiality for survival of the important human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), underscores the importance of the bacterial enzymes of this pathway as major antituberculosis drug targets. However, the identity of the mycobacterial enzyme that functions as the histidinol phosphate phosphatase (HolPase) of this pathway remains to be established. Here, we demonstrate that the enzyme encoded by the Rv3137 gene, belonging to the inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) family, functions as the Mtb HolPase and specifically dephosphorylates histidinol phosphate. The crystal structure of Rv3137 in apo form enabled us to dissect its distinct structural features. Furthermore, the holo-complex structure revealed that a unique cocatalytic multizinc-assisted mode of substrate binding and catalysis is the hallmark of Mtb HolPase. Interestingly, the enzyme-substrate complex structure unveiled that although monomers possess individual catalytic sites they share a common product-exit channel at the dimer interface. Furthermore, target-based screening against HolPase identified several small-molecule inhibitors of this enzyme. Taken together, our study unravels the missing enzyme link in the Mtb histidine biosynthesis pathway, augments our current mechanistic understanding of histidine production in Mtb, and has helped identify potential inhibitors of this bacterial pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2801847222,"The Wiener polarity number (which, nowadays, known as the Wiener polarity index and usually denoted by Wp) was devised by the chemist Harold Wiener, for predicting the boiling points of alkanes. The index Wp of chemical trees (chemical graphs representing alkanes) is defined as the number of unordered pairs of vertices (carbon atoms) at distance 3. The inverse problems based on some well-known topological indices have already been addressed in the literature. The solution of such inverse problems may be helpful in speeding up the discovery of lead compounds having the desired properties. This paper is devoted to solving a stronger version of the inverse problem based on Wiener polarity index for chemical trees. More precisely, it is proved that for every integer t ∈ {n - 3, n - 2,…,3n - 16, 3n - 15}, n ≥ 6, there exists an n-vertex chemical tree T such that Wp(T) = t."
https://openalex.org/W2802893100,"Despite the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to be a significant problem. Furthermore, the precise pathogenesis of this neurodegeneration is still unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between infection by the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and neuronal injury in the rhesus macaque using in vivo and postmortem sampling techniques. The effect of SIV infection in 23 adult rhesus macaques was investigated using an accelerated NeuroAIDS model. Disease progression was modulated either with combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART, 4 animals) or minocycline (7 animals). Twelve animals remained untreated. Viral loads were monitored in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid, as were levels of activated monocytes in the blood. Neuronal injury was monitored in vivo using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Viral RNA was quantified in brain tissue of each animal postmortem using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and neuronal injury was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Without treatment, viral RNA in plasma, cerebral spinal fluid, and brain tissue appears to reach a plateau. Neuronal injury was highly correlated both to plasma viral levels and a subset of infected/activated monocytes (CD14+CD16+), which are known to traffic the virus into the brain. Treatment with either cART or minocycline decreased brain viral levels and partially reversed alterations in in vivo and immunohistochemical markers for neuronal injury. These findings suggest there is significant turnover of replicating virus within the brain and the severity of neuronal injury is directly related to the brain viral load."
https://openalex.org/W2800565379,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been found in the pathogenesis of various fibrosis diseases, and ACE inhibitor (ACEI) may affect wound healing and cutaneous fibrosis. However, there is no scientific evidence as to where the ACE is produced during scar formation. Whether it is from the cutaneous tissue or the bone marrow, or both remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the source of ACE using bone marrow transplantation in genetically modified mice, analyzed the inflammatory milieu and some growth factors in the middle of the wound healing period (4 d after the wound was induced). After having deleted the ACE from bone marrow or skin tissue, the wound/scar width in the low-ACE groups were narrower than those in wild-type (WT) controls. Loosely arranged collagen deposition and reduced vessel density were also detected in ACE-deficient mice. Lower ACE levels during scar formation were also accompanied by lower levels of TGF-β1. In the middle of the wound healing period, ACE levels affected the inflammatory cells significantly. In the mice with a deficiency in ACE, the expression of TGF-β1 and TNF-α decreased, but not that of IL-4. Our findings indicate that both bone marrow and skin tissue release ACE during scar formation. Deleting either of them can affect the inflammatory cells and growth factors and reduce the expression of TGF-β1, resulting in a decreased level of scarring.—Fang, Q.-Q., Wang, X.-F., Zhao, W.-Y., Chen, C.-Y., Zhang, M.-X., Shi, B.-H., Zhang, L.-Y., Tan, W.-Q.

https://openalex.org/W2800866960,"To examine the origin of seizures induced by severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, The EEG characteristics of seizures were analyzed in newborns with and without severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the specificity. In total, 931 patients had a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level of 340–425 μmol/L, only 2 of whom had seizures. Compared to patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a TSB level of 340–425 μmol/L, those with a TSB level >425 μmol/L had a significant risk of seizure (OR = 213.2, 95% CI = 113.0–405.8, P<0.001). Of all 28 patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia and seizure, 26 had seizures that originated in the temporal and/or occipital lobe. In seizure patients without severe hyperbilirubinemia, origination in the temporal/occipital and other lobes occurred in 19 and 117 cases, respectively. Compared to the risk of seizure origination in the temporal and/or occipital lobe in other diseases, the risk in patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia was increased by approximately 80 times (OR = 80.1, 95% CI = 28.3–226.4, P<0.001). Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia can selectively induce temporal and occipital lobe seizures.

https://openalex.org/W2802078587,"Background Placental dysfunction is related to many pregnancy complications, but collecting placental specimens for investigation in large scale epidemiologic studies is often infeasible. Standard procedures involving immediate collection after birth and snap freezing are often cost prohibitive. We aimed to collect pilot data regarding the feasibility and precision of a simpler approach, the collection of tissue samples following 24 hours of refrigeration of whole placentae at 4°C, as compared to the “gold standard” of snap freezing excised tissue within 40 minutes of delivery for the assessment of inflammatory cytokines. Methods Placentae were collected from 12 women after delivering live-born singleton babies via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Two placentae were utilized to establish laboratory tissue processing and assay protocols. The other 10 placentae were utilized in a comparison of three tissue collection conditions. Specifically, key inflammatory cytokines were measured in 3 sections, representing three collection conditions. Sections 1 (full thickness) and 2 (excised prior to freezing) were obtained within 40 minutes of delivery and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and section 3 (full thickness) was obtained after refrigerating the placenta at 4°C for 24 hours. Results IL-6, IL-10, and IL-8 all had comparable concentrations and variability overall in all three section types. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were too low among samples to reliably measure using immunoassay. Conclusions Refrigeration of placentae prior to processing does not appear to compromise detection of these cytokines for purposes of large scale studies. These findings provide a framework and preliminary data for the study of inflammatory cytokines within the placenta in large scale and/or resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2802782718,"Ferns are an important component of ecosystems around the world. Studies of the impacts that global changes may have on ferns are scarce, yet emerging studies indicate that some species may be particularly sensitive to climate change. The lack of research in this subject is much more aggravated in the case of epiphytes, and especially those that live under temperate climates. A mathematical model was developed for two temperate epiphytic ferns in order to predict potential impacts on spore germination kinetics, in response to different scenarios of global change, coming from increasing temperature and forest fragmentation. Our results show that an increasing temperature will have a negative impact over the populations of these temperate epiphytic ferns. Under unfragmented forests the germination percentage was comparatively less influenced than in fragmented patches. This study highlight that, in the long term, populations of the studied epiphytic temperate ferns may decline due to climate change. Overall, epiphytic fern communities will suffer changes in diversity, richness and dominance. Our study draws attention to the role of ferns in epiphytic communities of temperate forests, emphasizing the importance of considering these plants in any conservation strategy, specifically forest conservation. From a methodological point of view, the model we propose could be easily used to dynamically monitor the status of ecosystems, allowing the quick prediction of possible future scenarios, which is a crucial issue in biodiversity conservation decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2800918179,"Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated in vitro into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF OCT4, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells in vitro and to endodermal tumor formation in vivo. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types."
