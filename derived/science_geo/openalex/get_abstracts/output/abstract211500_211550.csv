https://openalex.org/W2022181875,"Lymphocytes from two unrelated individuals, cultured together in the same tube, undergo morphological transformation to large cells and divide. Both of these parameters may be estimated quantitatively. There is a correlation between the degree of this response and the degree of cross-reactivity of grafts from the two individuals placed on a third unrelated recipient."

https://openalex.org/W2022168751,"THE non-enzymatic asymmetric synthesis of α-amino-acids has long been of considerable stereochemical interest. However, the method of catalytic hydrogenation is the only one appearing in the literature1–8. In this communication, a new method of asymmetric synthesis of α-amino-acids in solution is described."
https://openalex.org/W2079037792,"Since 1946 biomedical writers have shown no marked trend toward multiple authorship; the average number of authors per paper remains steady at about 2.3. This is in strong contrast tothe conclusion of Price from a study of Chemical Abstracts that the chemists' trend toward four or more authors per paper has been during this period, and continues to be, steeply exponential."

https://openalex.org/W2036268326,"Hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials have been discovered in fibers of the ""jumping"" muscle of the grasshopper. These potentials attenuate the depolarizing excitatory postsynaptic responses. They are enhanced during depolarization of the muscle fiber with applied current and are diminished and then reversed during hyperpolarization. The electrogenesisappears to be caused by chloride-activation. Gamma-aminobutyric acid activates the inhibitorysynaptic membrane and picrotoxin is an inactivator agent."
https://openalex.org/W1995836804,Cultures of peripheral lymphocytes may be used to assay histocompatibility. The lymphocytes from potential kidney recipients are cultured with those from potential donors and the percentage of large cells and mitoses stimulated is determined. The immunologic competence of cultured lymphocytes from recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy is evaluated by determining their responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin. Suppression of response appears to be correlated with the absence of clinical signs of graft rejection.

https://openalex.org/W2021337382,"Changes in the fluorescence of the cell wall of Salmonella typhosa (TY2 W) were studied during growth after direct labeling with fluorescein conjugated homologous or ""anti-O"" globulins. Fluorescence decreased evenly with culture growth and cell division, but the addition ofchloramphenicol resulted in large, nondividing cells that showed increasing interruption of fluorescence of the wall marker. The process thus differs from the equatorial origin and discrete hemispherical addition of new wall previously described in Streptococcus pyogenes. These findings, in addition to demonstrating the formation of new wall in the presence of chloramphenicol, appear consistent only with the concept that wall replication in the salmonellas occurs by means of diffuse intercalation of new materials among old."

https://openalex.org/W2083766656,"Granulocytic leukemia, induced in the primary mouse by x-irradiation, was serially transmitted to RF/Up mice. An extra chromosome, as well as a morphologicaly unusual chromosome, was found in the bone marrow cells of all the leukemic mice that had been injected previously either with leukemic spleen cells or with cell-free ultracentrifugates. This suggests that the changes in the chromosomes are caused by a virus."

https://openalex.org/W2081191445,"Cephalothin, 7-(thiophene-2-acetamido)-cephalosporanic acid, suppresses synthesis of the cell of Staphylococcus aureus. Exposure to this agent led to a reduction in the degree of incorporation of carbon-14-lysine into the mucopeptide of the cell wall material and to an accumulation of N-acetyl glucosamine in the cell. The intensity of the lesions was comparable to that produced by penicillin."

https://openalex.org/W1969618115,"THE biological role of selenium is as yet unknown, but the evidence accumulating from many investigations1–13 suggests that this element is necessary in trace amounts for normal structure and function of muscle and other tissues. In our investigations on the possible relation between selenium content of tissues and muscular dystrophy occurring as a hereditary disease in chickens, it seemed appropriate to determine the amounts of selenium in eggs from normal and dystrophic birds. We thank Prof. W. Landauer of the University of Connecticut at Storrs for his collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W1966484064,"WHEN a conventional starch strip washed in glycerol solution is placed on a glass or ‘Perspex’ plate and dried, one of two difficulties almost always arises: either the strip adheres firmly to the rigid base, comes under increasing tension as it dries and finally tears or, alternatively, it becomes detached along its edges which curl up and the strips become distorted. The method we published for overcoming these difficulties is to strengthen the gel by impregnation with gelatin. Dr. Baur's method of starch-gel electrophoresis affords an alternative solution to this problem. He prepares his starch gel as a relatively large thin sheet on a cellulose backing and several haemoglobin or serum specimens are run side by side on this sheet. The cellulose backing supports the gel and prevents tearing during manipulation and drying, and having several strips united in one sheet reduces the difficulty that arises from the curling edges."

The irritant nature of these particles and their small size and associated long atmospheric residence time, as well as the short half-life of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, suggest that particulate sulfate may be abetter indicator of atmospheric pollution than sulfur dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W2087295600,"WE have recently determined the blood groups of 99 patients with some variety of articular disease (31 with rheumatoid arthritis, 31 with rheumatoid spondylitis, 15 with gout, 9 with disseminated lupus erythematosus, 6 with familial Mediterranean fever, and 7 with various other diseases). Statistical analyses demonstrated no significant heterogeneity among the results obtained for the different diseases. Accordingly, the data were pooled. For comparison we used Wiener's series of 1071 New York Whites1, as in a previous investigation2. There is a significant correlation between the absence of the Rh antigen D and rheumatic disease, as shown in Table 1. No correlation was found between the presence of rheumatic disease and antigens C or E, or with the ABO blood group system. There did, however, seem to be a correlation with the absence of antigen N (χ2(2), = 9.59, P = 8 × 103)."

https://openalex.org/W1997884531,"SINCE the discovery of kinetin by Miller et al.1 and its remarkable ability to stimulate the growth of plant tissue, much literature has accumulated on this subject and has been reviewed recently2. The effect of kinetin has been tested on micro-organisms, especially protozoa3–7. While some investigators have reported that kinetin exerted no effect on bacteria8–10, it is known to promote changes in population in some bacteria9 and to stimulate the growth of Escherichia coli7 as well as some yeasts10."

https://openalex.org/W2064750379,"IMBALANCES in amino-acids and excessively high-protein content of the diet (66 per cent or more) depress food intake and retard growth in rats. It has been suggested that resulting metabolic disturbances affected the mechanism of regulation of food intake. The fact that in some instances administration of insulin counteracts the growth-retarding effect of leucine excess was taken as supporting this view1. Going one step further, it has been suggested that blood amino-acid patterns played a crucial part in the mechanism of satiety and the regulation of food intake2,3. The experiments presented here were designed to show whether excess or imbalanced amino-acid and protein intake do, in fact, act on the mechanism regulating food intake or whether they limit food intake by acting through other structures. Inasmuch as it has been shown that the ventromedial hypothalamic area regulates food intake, that is, adjusts food intake to energy output4, apparently by inhibiting constantly activated lateral ‘feeding centres’5 and exercising some measure of control over gastric contractions6, the animals used were ten female albino rats (Charles River strain) the ‘satiety’ centres of which had been destroyed by electrocoagulation of the ventromedial area."

On the other hand, it is reported2 that some authors have been examining the production by microorganisms of feed supplements, fatty acids and other oxidation products from hydrocarbons. Recently, we investigated whether some enzymes are formed by microorganisms grown on hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source, and have found that extracellular lipase is formed by 5 strains out of 26 micro-organisms tested."

https://openalex.org/W2043017742,Ventral-root positivities exhibiting the time course of antidromic inhibition were recorded in the cat. Hyperpolarization of the motoneuron occurs concomitant to antidromic inhibitionwithout damage to the motoneuron. Under optimal conditions L7 and S1 ventral-root filaments show electrotonic potentials of positive sign with the time course of antidromic inhibition. Conditions predisposing to membrane depolarization are not responsible for this hyperpolarization. Antidromic inhibition was not found in roots caudal to S1.
