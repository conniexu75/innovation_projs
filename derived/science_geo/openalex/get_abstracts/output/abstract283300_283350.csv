https://openalex.org/W2055110549,"Small metal particles (<5 nanometers), which are widely used in catalysis, have physical and chemical properties that are markedly different from those of the bulk metal. The differences are related to crystal structure, and it is therefore significant that structural rearrangements in small particles have been observed in real time by using high-resolution electron microscopy. A detailed investigation at the atomic level has been made of the factors affecting the dynamic activity of small gold crystals that are supported on thin films of amorphous carbon, silicon, and germanium. The rate of activity depends mainly on the current density of the incident electron beam and the degree of contact of the particle with the substrate, but this rate decreases rapidly as the particle size is increased. The activity of the particles is very similar on either carbon or silicon, but it is generally less marked on germanium because of increased contact between the particle and the substrate. The electron beam effectively heats the particles, and it appears that their dynamic behavior depends on their thermal contact with the substrate."

Answers to the latter question have been almost teleological in their assumption of optimal design. However, close examination of certain systems has revealed features that apparently lack adaptive value. Their existence can be understood only if the evolution of these circuits is considered and, in particular, how nonadaptive determinants have guided that evolution."

In contrast, the nitrous oxide content of soil water in an intact, second-growth forest was close to the expected theoretical value. Nitrous oxide, produced at active sites in the soil, dissolves in soil water and is transported to seeps and streams where it rapidly degasses from the solution and is released into the atmosphere. This loss of nitrous oxide after clear-cutting is not important to the nitrogen economy of the site; however, it may be important to the global atmospheric budget of nitrous oxide. Sources of nitrous oxide may have been overlooked because nitrous oxide emissions can be separated in time and space from the sites of the most intense production of nitrous oxide."

Extraterrestrial particles collected from this region are well preserved and are collectable in large quantities. The collected particles are generally identical to cosmic spheres found on the ocean floor, but a pure glass type was discovered that has not been seen in deep-sea samples. Iron-rich spheres are conspicuously rare in the collected material."

These include bullet-shaped, bicellular microhairs, dumbbell-shaped silica bodies, cross-shaped suberin cells, papillae, stomata with low dome- to triangular-shaped subsidiary cells, and Kranz leaf anatomy. The leaf fragment extends the fossil record of plants that show both anatomical and external micromorphological features indicating C(4) photo-synthesis back to the Miocene. On the basis of associated mammals, the leaf fragment is assigned a Hemphillian age (7 to 5 million years ago)."
https://openalex.org/W2082888487,Sludges are labile putrescible materials which must undergo a heterotrophic decomposition process and be subject to humification before becoming stabilized substances. An understanding of the principles underlying these processes may give rise to better management plans for the application of sludge to land. Procedures are suggested for the evaluation of sludge stabilization rates.
https://openalex.org/W2005299246,"Unusual pentagonally twinned precipitates were observed in a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy study of needle-shaped germanium particles in aluminum. Although commonly found in small particles formed on substrates, such twinning has not been seen in precipitates grown in the solid state. The morphologies and orientation relationships are consistent with symmetry principles."

The regime for marine scientific research proposed in the draft text of the Convention on the Law of the Sea may alleviate some difficulties but will not change the predominant influence of political considerations on decisions affecting clearance for research."
