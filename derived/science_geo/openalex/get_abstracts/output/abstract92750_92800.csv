https://openalex.org/W1605030605,"Rat osteosarcoma cells respond to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with a 6-fold increase in intracellular and secreted levels of the vitamin K-dependent protein of bone (BGP). The rise in intracellular BGP levels is half-maximal at 6.6 h and precedes the rise in medium BGP levels by 6 h, a time course which is consistent with the postulated steroid hormone action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This effect is achieved by physiological levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, with half of the maximal response at a vitamin concentration of 0.04 ng/ml. The specificity of this effect for BGP is demonstrated by the absence of a 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 effect on total protein synthesis by these cells. To our knowledge, BGP is the first example of a bone protein whose rate of synthesis is dramatically and specifically increased by physiological levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The possible functions of BGP in the biological actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on bone are discussed."

The metabolic response of the AVC increased more rapidly with scene complexity than that of the PVC, indicating the greater involvement of the higher order AVC for complex visual interpretations. Increases in local metabolic activity by as much as a factor of 2 above that of control subjects with eyes closed indicate the wide range and metabolic reserve of the visual cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2050009399,"Two major functionally distinct T cell subsets in man have been defined with heteroantiserums and monoclonal antibodies directed against stable cell surface antigens that appear during thymic ontogeny. A monoclonal antibody to T4 antigen (anti-T4) is reactive with the peripheral inducer T cell population while a monoclonal antibody to T5 antigen (anti-T5) is reactive with the cytotoxic and suppressor population. Immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel were used to show that on human thymocytes or peripheral T cells the T4 antigen is a single 62,000-dalton glycoprotein while the T5 antigen is a complex of two glycoproteins, one being 30,000 daltons and the other 32,000 daltons. Similar glycoproteins have been isolated with antibodies to murine Lyt 1 and Lyt 2,3 antigens. Both the antigens defining the phenotypes of inducer and suppressor populations in man and mouse are structurally homologous."

https://openalex.org/W2067348920,"Human keratinocytes, derived from the skin of newborns and of adults, were grown in the complete absence of serum, in a hormone-supplemented medium on fibronectin-coated cell culture dishes at low seed density. The cell culture medium consisted of Medium 199 containing epidermal growth factor, triiodothyronine, hydrocortisone, Cohn fraction IV, insulin, transferrin, bovine brain extract, and trace elements. Removal of the brain extract from the hormone supplement had a greater negative impact on proliferation of the keratinocyte cultures than did the removal of epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, and triiodothyronine or Cohn fraction IV. The growth of keratinocytes in this hormone-supplemented medium suggests that control of keratinocyte growth depends in large part on endocrine stimulation by other body organs, including the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2066144417,"The molecular structure of a mouse immunoglobulin D from a plasmacytoma tumor and that of the normal mouse gene coding for immunoglobulin D are presented. The DNA sequence results indicate an unusual structure for the tumor delta chain in two respects: (i) Only two constant (C) region domains, termed C delta 1 and C delta 3 by homology considerations, are found; the two domains are separated by an unusual hinge region C delta H that lacks cysteine residues and thus cannot provide the covalent cross-links between heavy chains typically seen in immunoglobulins. The two domains and hinge are all coded on separate exons. (ii) At the carboxyl end of the delta chain there is a stretch of 26 amino acids that is coded from an exon located 2750 to 4600 base pairs downstream from the rest of the gene. Analogy with immunoglobulin M suggests that this distally coded segment C delta DC may have a membrane-binding function; however, it is only moderately hydrophobic. A fifth potential exon (C delta AC), located adjacent to the 3' (carboxyl) end of C delta 3, could code for a stretch of 49 amino acids. The tumor's expression of the delta gene may be aberrant, but the simplest interpretation would be that this tumor expresses one of the several biologically significant forms of the delta chain."

https://openalex.org/W2091652406,"Serum and three mitogens for mouse embryo 3T3 cells—fibroblast growth factor from brain, fibroblast growth factor from pituitary, and epidermal growth factor—specifically stimulate the synthesis and release into the medium by these cells of a group of proteins that travel together on SDS gel electrophoresis and that are detected by 35S-methionine labeling. These proteins, designated mitogen-releasable proteins (MRPs), have a median, monomer molecular weight on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 34,000 daltons (30,000–38,000 daltons). Our evidence indicates that these proteins comprise a family of glycoproteins, probably with a common polypeptide backbone. The observations supporting this conclusion are that MRPs give a diffuse pattern of bands upon SDS gel electrophoresis; travel as a single, diffuse band when resolved by electrophoresis in the absence of SDS; adsorb to a pea-lectin-sepharose column and can be eluted with α-methyl mannose; and can be labeled metabolically with 3H-mannose. In addition, in the presence of tunicamycin, MRPs are not made—instead, a smaller molecular weight (22,000 dalton), and apparently homogeneous, protein appears. We believe this 22,000 dalton protein to be the unglycosylated form of MRP. Further support for this idea comes from our observation that treatment of MRPs with endoglycosidase H produces a protein with a molecular weight slightly greater than 22,000 daltons. The effect of mitogens on DNA synthesis and MRP release are correlated in the following ways. First, serum factors are required for both responses. Second, in 3T3 cells transformed by SV40, Moloney and Kirsten viruses that do not synthesize DNA in response to FGF, MRPs are not released in response to FGF. Third, in untransformed 3T3 cells, the dose-response curves for fibroblast growth factor on MRP release and thymidine incorporation are closely correlated. Fourth, insulin, a poor mitogen for 3T3 cells, does not enhance MRP release. Fifth, stimulation of MRP release by epidermal growth factor or fibroblast growth factor is inhibited by hydroxyurea and butyrate, both inhibitors of DNA synthesis in these cells. Sixth, if the mitogen is removed at any time during the 20 hr preincubation period, the effect on MRP release observed between 20 and 24 hr is severely diminished."

https://openalex.org/W1999951703,"Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood of normal humans, unselected spleen cells from patients with Hodgkin's disease, and selected T and non-T lymphoid cells from normal peripheral blood and from the spleens of Hodgkin's disease patients were examined for de novo synthesis and secretion of ferritin. After precipitation of labeled lysates and supernatants from unseparated and selected T cells with antiserum to human liver ferritin, two bands were visible on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylimide gel analysis. The two bands were detected in molecular weight regions 19,000 and 21,000, which are thought to represent the L and H subunits of the ferritin molecule, respectively. The slower band (subunit H) was more radioactive than the faster band (subunit L). The H subunit is found in greater amounts in the serum of some tumor patients, but its cellular origin has not been established. The present findings indicate that cells of the immune system contribute to the synthesis and secretion of a ferritin molecule with a high proportion of H subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1579778455,"The essential active site responsible for the inflammatory activities of C3a, an anaphylatoxin derived from the serum complement system, has been elucidated using C3a peptides synthesized by the solid phase method and assayed for their ability to contract guinea pig ileal tissue and to produce a wheal and flare response in human skin. The COOH-terminal C3a pentapeptide (Leu-Gly-Leu-Ala-Arg) common to rat, pig, and man shows vascular and smooth muscle activity as well as specificity similar to natural human C3a. The porcine C3a octapeptide is 3 times more active than the common pentapeptide, but the human octapeptide (Ala(70)-Ser-His-Leu(73)-Gly-Leu(75)-Ala-Arg(77) is 12 times more active than the pentapeptide. Replacement of the serine and histidine by alanine or acetylation of the NH2 terminus provides analogues with the same activity as the octapeptide. Thus, the increased activity of the human C3a octapeptide over the pentapeptide appears to be related to the backbone of residues 70 to 72 and is not due to the presence of the hydroxyl group of serine-71, the imidazole ring of histidine-72, or a positive charge at or near the NH2 terminus. Since the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide is 40 times less active than the pentapeptide, an adequate model of the essential active site of C3a anaphylatoxin is the common COOH-terminal pentapeptide region. A C3a active site analogue containing a COOH-terminal lysyl residue is devoid of ileal activity. In addition, the [alanine-73]pentapeptide is 9 times less active and the [alanine-75]pentapeptide is at least 70 times less active than the active site pentapeptide in the ileal assay. Thus, the hydrophobic side chains of leucine-73 and leucine-75 and the guanidinium group of arginine-77 are important for the contractile activity of the active site COOH-terminal pentapeptide of human C3a anaphylatoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1537294977,"Intracellular accumulation of intact 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (125I-EGF) in corneal or granulosa cell cultures exposed to either chloroquine or leupeptin can be 10-fold higher than that observed in cultures not exposed to the lysosomal inhibitors. This has made it possible to study the translocation and accumulation of 125I-EGF in a nuclear fraction of both cell types. The accumulation of 125I-EGF was found to be dependent on the inhibitor's concentrations. Chloroquine at a concentration of 5 X 10(-5) M yielded a maximal nuclear accumulation which amounted to 18% of the total 125I-EGF present within the bovine corneal endothelial cells exposed to chloroquine. Nuclear accumulation could be detected in that cell type as early as 4 h after cultures were exposed to both chloroquine and 125I-EGF and was maximal by 24 h. Saturation of nuclear accumulation of 125I-EGF in corneal endothelial and granulosa cell cultures was observed at 20 and 10 ng/ml of 125I-EGF, respectively. After 24 h, 1.06 X 10(4) and 1.4 X 10(4) 125I-EGF molecules were found associated with granulosa or corneal endothelial nuclei, respectively. In corneal endothelial cell cultures exposed to chloroquine, a small fraction (0.6%) of 125I-EGF associated with the cell was found to be irreversibly found to a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 185,000, and 50% of these irreversible 125I-EGF . receptor complexes were found to be associated with the nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W1512610375,"Complementation of the nonidentical subunits (alpha and beta) of luciferases isolated from two different bioluminescent strains, Beneckea harveyi and Photobacterium phosphoreum, has resulted in the formation of a functional hybrid luciferase (alpha h beta p) containing the alpha subunit from B. harveyi luciferase (alpha h) and the beta subunit from P. phosphoreum luciferase (beta p). The complementation was unidirectional; activity could not be restored by complementing the alpha subunit of P. phosphoreum luciferase with the beta subunit of B. harveyi luciferase, showing that the subunits from these luciferases were not identical. Kinetic parameters of the hybrid luciferase reflecting the intermediate and later steps of the bioluminescent reaction as well as the overall activity and specificity were essentially identical to the same kinetic parameters for B. harveyi luciferase, the source of the alpha subunit, and quite distinct from those of P. phosphoreum luciferase. However, kinetic parameters that reflected the initial step in the reaction involving interaction of FMNH2 and luciferase were altered in the hybrid luciferase compared to both the parental luciferases, the Kd for FMNH2 actually being closer to that observed for the P. phosphoreum luciferase (the source of the beta subunit). These results provide direct evidence that modification or alteration of the beta subunit in a dimeric luciferase molecule can affect the kinetic properties and indicates that the beta subunit plays a functional role in the bioluminescent mechanism. It is proposed that both the alpha and beta subunits are involved with the initial interaction with FMNH2, whereas subsequent steps in the mechanism are dictated exclusively by the alpha subunit and are unaffected by alterations in the beta subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1482528362,"mammals. When excess iron was injected, mature red cells of larvae accumulated ferritin iron (increased from 200 pg/ml of cells to 410 pg/ml of cells) and ferritin protein (increased from 0.37 to 1.2% of the soluble protein), which resulted from the de novo synthesis of subunits (increased from 1.9 to 6.3% of the total protein synthesized); there was no detectable ferritin subunit pool. Iron did not change ferritin microheterogeneity. Ferritin synthesis was more sensitive (2-5 times) to inhibitors of translation than total protein syfithesis, indicating that iron may affect the translation of ferritin mRNA as previously observed in rat liver. In vitro, either transferrin or iron-nitrilotriacetic acid donated iron to red cells and ferritin; maximum uptake occurred with a combination of both donors. Iron storage in the larval red cell was similar to liver, except for the apparent absence of a ferritin subunit pool in red cells. Moreover, red cells were more efficient than the liver in acquiring iron for storage, and earlier studies showed that red cell iron stores were used more rapidly than liver stores;, the accessibility of red cells for iron storage may relate to their role in ontogeny. Although an ontogenetic decrease in available iron (transferrin) occurs which could affect red cell iron storage, increasing available iron experimentally had no effect on mature red cells of adults, suggesting an ontogenetic change at the cellular level independent of the change in transferrin."

https://openalex.org/W1997915357,"Mouse thymocytes can be divided into two broad classes by a variety of criteria, including steroid sensitivity, buoyant density, and availability of binding sites for peanut agglutinin. The major class is poorly reactive in immune functional assays, whereas the minor population does contain cells that are immunologically competent. Correlated with these functional differences, the populations differ in their displays of specific surface antigens and in their steady-state terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity. To investigate the basis for these phenotypic differences, the two populations were enriched by density gradient fractionation or by differential PNA agglutination; alternatively, the minor population was freed of the major one by in vivo cortisone treatment. These partially purified cells were then examined for their rates of de novo synthesis of four differentiation marker proteins. Incorporation of ^(35)S-methionine into H-2 (K and/or D), TL, TdT, and a Qa-region product (probably Qa-1) was monitored by immune precipitation with specific antisera followed by gel electrophoresis. The metabolic labeling interval was restricted to 30–40 min, to reflect as closely as possible instantaneous rates of synthesis. The two thymocyte populations were found to differ significantly in their production of each of these molecules. Relative to its total protein synthesis, the major population synthesized 10–20 fold less H-2, 5–10 fold more TdT, and 10–20 fold more TL than the minor population. The Qa product was synthesized in both populations, but at a slightly higher rate in the minor population. The biosynthetic rates are consistent with the reported steady-state phenotypes of the cells, and imply that changes in differentiation antigen expression during T lymphocyte development are controlled, at least in part, at a translational or pretranslational level."

When the oocytes completed maturity in vitro and were activated, the somatic nuclei transformed into ""fertilization"" nuclei and promoted development through embryogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2397741733,"Rhodopseudomonas spheroides when grown on a medium deficient of cobalt excretes significant amounts of descobaltocorrinoids into the culture broth. If grown in the presence of 4 microM CoCl2 only intracellular cobalt-containing corrinoids are detected. The extracellular corrinoids have been identified as hydrogenobyrinic acid c-amide and hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide which are accompanied by varying amounts of the corresponding 13-epicorrinoids. The latter, which could not be separated in the metal-free form, are artifacts arising from the excreted descobaltocorrinoids under the alkaline conditions of the culture broth. The red metal-free corrinoids have been converted into the corresponding cobalt-containing corrinoids and were characterized by their CD, UV, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectra. Insertion of cobalt into the fraction of hydrogenobyrinic acid c-amide has yielded small amounts of a cobalt-containing corrinoid, for which the structure of 18,19-didehydrocobyrinic acid c-amide is suggested. A 14C-labeled specimen of hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide was obtained by feeding [14C]acetate to growing cultures of R. spheroides. Experiments with broken cell systems of Propionibacterium shermanii and R. spheroides have indicated that metal-free corrinoids are not precursors of the cobamides. The results are discussed with respect to the final steps of the biosynthesis of vitamin B12."
