Until recently, GPCRs were considered to be the only natural substrates for GRKs. However, the recent discovery that GRKs also phosphorylate tubulin raised the possibility that additional GRK substrates exist and that the cellular role of GRKs may be much broader than just GPCR regulation. Here we report that synucleins are a novel class of GRK substrates. Synucleins (α, β, γ, and synoretin) are 14-kDa proteins that are highly expressed in brain but also found in numerous other tissues. α-Synuclein has been linked to the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We found that all synucleins are GRK substrates, with GRK2 preferentially phosphorylating the α and β isoforms, whereas GRK5 prefers α-synuclein as a substrate. GRK-mediated phosphorylation of synuclein is activated by factors that stimulate receptor phosphorylation, such as lipids (all GRKs) and Gβγ subunits (GRK2/3), suggesting that GPCR activation may regulate synuclein phosphorylation. GRKs phosphorylate synucleins at a single serine residue within the C-terminal domain. Although the function of synucleins remains largely unknown, recent studies have demonstrated that these proteins can interact with phospholipids and are potent inhibitors of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) in vitro. PLD2 regulates the breakdown of phosphatidylcholine and has been implicated in vesicular trafficking. We found that GRK-mediated phosphorylation inhibits synuclein's interaction with both phospholipids and PLD2. These findings suggest that GPCRs may be able to indirectly stimulate PLD2 activity via their ability to regulate GRK-promoted phosphorylation of synuclein.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). GRKs specifically recognize and phosphorylate agonist-occupied GPCRs. Receptor phosphorylation and subsequent binding of another protein, arrestin, uncouples activated receptor from G protein. These events can also promote receptor endocytosis. Internalized receptors are then either dephosphorylated and recycled back to the cell surface or targeted to lysosomes for degradation. The seven mammalian GRKs that have been identified can be divided into three subfamilies based on their overall structural organization and homology: GRK1 (rhodopsin kinase) and GRK7; GRK2 (βARK1) and GRK3 (βARK2); and GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6. Common features shared by the GRKs include a centrally localized catalytic domain of ∼270 amino acids, an N-terminal domain of ∼190 amino acids that has been implicated in receptor interaction and GRK regulation, and a variable length C-terminal domain of 105–233 amino acids that is involved in phospholipid association.Until recently, GPCRs were considered to be the only natural substrates for GRKs. Common protein kinase substrates, such as casein, phosvitin, and synthetic peptides are relatively poor substrates for GRKs. Even inactive GPCRs are not phosphorylated well. These observations suggest that GRKs might be highly specialized kinases, which phosphorylate only activated receptors. However, several laboratories recently demonstrated that GRKs can also bind and effectively phosphorylate the cytoskeletal protein tubulin (3Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.G.

Biochem. 1998; 255: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GRK-mediated phosphorylation of tubulin appears to be stimulated by β2-adrenergic receptor activation (3Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12316-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, GRK6 appears to selectively phosphorylate the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor via a PDZ domain-mediated interaction (6Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24328-24334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role for GRK-mediated phosphorylation of tubulin and the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor is unclear at present, these examples suggest that GRKs may have a broader substrate selectivity than previously assumed and thus play a wider role in signaling than previously appreciated.In this study, we explored the possibility that additional nonreceptor GRK substrates exist. In our search for such substrates, we identified synucleins as a novel family of GRK substrates. Synucleins have been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and may be involved in regulating intracellular vesicular trafficking (7Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We identified the site phosphorylated by GRKs in α-synuclein and demonstrated that this phosphorylation inhibits the ability of α-synuclein to interact with phospholipids and results in reduced inhibition of phospholipase D2 (PLD2).DISCUSSIONA significant role of GRKs in the regulation of GPCR-mediated signaling is well established (1Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Many experiments, which include gene-targeted knockouts and transgenic protein overexpression, demonstrated the importance of GRK-mediated phosphorylation in receptor desensitization. However, our understanding of GRK function is far from complete, and research continues to uncover novel ways of GRK regulation as well as new functions for these kinases. For example, the identification of an RGS homology domain in GRKs (22Siderovski D.P. Hessel A. Chung S. Mak T.W. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 211-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) led to the discovery that GRK2 and GRK3 can specifically interact with activated αq/11 and inhibit αq/11-mediated signaling (23Carman C.V. Parent J.-L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This finding demonstrates that GRKs might be able to regulate signaling in a manner that is independent of their enzymatic activity.Other recent studies have shown that GRK phosphorylation is not limited to activated receptors as substrates. GRKs can also efficiently phosphorylate nonreceptor protein substrates, such as Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (6Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24328-24334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and tubulin (3Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12316-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 4Carman C.V. Som T. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J.

Biochem. 1998; 255: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the role for this phosphorylation is undetermined, phosphorylation of tubulin suggests that GRKs might be involved in regulating microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization. The cytoskeleton plays an important role in assembly of signaling networks and is also involved in such processes as endocytosis and vesicular trafficking. It is possible that GRK-mediated tubulin phosphorylation during a signaling event activates rearrangement of microtubules, thus contributing to receptor internalization, recycling, or degradation. It is also possible that GRKs might be involved in the regulation of signaling and cytoskeleton dynamics by phosphorylating additional protein substrates.In our search for novel nonreceptor GRK substrates, we identified α-synuclein as a protein phosphorylated by GRKs in a brain extract. α-Synuclein belongs to a family of small proteins (127–140 amino acids), which currently includes four members (α-, β-, and γ-synucleins and synoretin) (7Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Surguchov A. Surguchova I. Solessio E. Baehr W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Synucleins are expressed at high levels in the brain and at lower levels in many tissues and common cell lines such as 293 and COS. α-Synuclein has been linked to the development of neurodegenerative disease. For example, a fragment of α-synuclein is a component of senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease patients. α-Synuclein is also found within Lewy bodies inside neurons of Parkinson's disease patients. Indeed, two independent autosomal mutations (A53T and A30P) in the α-synuclein gene have been linked to the early onset inherited forms of Parkinson's disease in two families (24Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C.

Schols L. Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3263) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of human α-synuclein in transgenic mice resulted in progressive accumulation of Lewy body-like structures in neurons and a loss of dopaminergic terminals in the basal ganglia (26Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). Another member of the synuclein family, γ-synuclein, may play a role in the etiology of breast cancer (27Ji H. Liu Y.E. Jia T. Wang M. Liu J. Xiao G. Joseph B.K. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 759-764PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the biological role of synucleins is not yet defined, recent studies have begun to shed some light on their functions. For example, synucleins have the ability to form fibrils in vitro (28Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). The accelerated fibril formation by mutant synucleins may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The intracellular localization of synucleins is also not well defined. Although some studies have shown that synucleins are cytosolic proteins, others have demonstrated that synucleins are associated with synaptic vesicles (7Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and other membranes (29McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Ribich S. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8812-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein was shown to interact with phospholipids. This interaction is facilitated mainly by a conserved N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1–94), which changes its structure from “unfolded” to α-helical upon binding to lipids (21Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Because of synuclein's ability to interact with lipids and their association with synaptic vesicles, it has been suggested that synucleins might be involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking (7Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).Recent studies have identified some proteins that can interact with synucleins. Synucleins can bind to 14-3-3 proteins, protein kinase C, BAD, and Erk (30Ostrerova N. Petrucelli L. Farrer M. Mehta N. Choi P. Hardy J. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are also potent inhibitors of PLD2 in vitro (16Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of synoretin activates Elk-1 transcription factor (10Surguchov A. Surguchova I. Solessio E. Baehr W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been also suggested that synucleins can be regulated by phosphorylation (7Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 16Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), since bovine β-synuclein occurs as a phosphoprotein and can be phosphorylated in vitro by CaMKII (17Nakajo S. Tsukada K. Omata K. Nakamura Y. Nakaya K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that α-synuclein is phosphorylated in cells and that phosphosynuclein is rapidly dephosphorylated by okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases (18Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P. Haas C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that the casein kinases CK1 and CK2 can phosphorylate α-synuclein in vitro. However, whether these kinases phosphorylate other synuclein subtypes and what regulates phosphorylation and the consequences of synuclein phosphorylation have not been determined.Here we demonstrated that all four synucleins are substrates for GRKsin vitro. All tested GRKs can phosphorylate synucleins, albeit with different efficiency. α-Synuclein appears to be the best substrate for all GRKs, whereas γ-synuclein and synoretin are phosphorylated significantly slower. Of all tested kinases, GRK2 phosphorylates β-synuclein most efficiently. Other kinases can also phosphorylate synucleins. As has been reported, both CK1 and CK2 phosphorylate α-synuclein. In addition, CK2 can effectively phosphorylate γ-synuclein but not β-synuclein or synoretin. CaMKII phosphorylates γ-synuclein best, although not very efficiently. Co-expression of α-synuclein with GRKs in COS-1 cells demonstrated that GRK2 and GRK5 can also phosphorylate this protein in cells.We determined that synuclein phosphorylation by GRKs can be regulated by some of the factors that are also known to regulate receptor phosphorylation. Synuclein phosphorylation by all GRKs is enhanced by phospholipids. For GRK2, this effect is dependent on the presence of Gβγ. Because Gβγ is believed to be released after receptor activation, it is plausible that activation of receptors by extracellular stimuli may lead to synuclein phosphorylation via activated GRK2. Because both GRK and synuclein can bind to liposomes, the mechanism for the lipid-mediated increase in synuclein phosphorylation is unclear. One possibility is that synucleins undergo a conformational change when they bind to phospholipids, making them a better substrate for GRKs. Another possibility is that phospholipids directly activate the catalytic activity of GRKs. The latter seems more likely, since the EC50 (0.04 mg/ml phospholipid) for GRK5-mediated α-synuclein phosphorylation by liposomes closely matches the EC50 for GRK5 binding to liposomes (31Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and is significantly lower than the EC50 for α-synuclein binding to phospholipids (Fig. 7 A). Interestingly, liposomes also enhance the phosphorylation of α-synuclein by CK2. However, this effect is not universal; phospholipids have no effect on α-synuclein phosphorylation by CK1 or γ-synuclein phosphorylation by CK2.Surprisingly, phosphorylation of α-synuclein by GRK5 is also activated by Ca2+/calmodulin, which is known to potently inhibit GRK5-mediated receptor phosphorylation (8Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Chuang T.T. Paolucci L. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28691-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that regulation of GRK5 by calmodulin may be more complex than previously thought. Calmodulin may not only regulate the catalytic activity of GRK5, but it may also change the substrate specificity of the kinase. Calmodulin-dependent activation of phosphorylation appears to be GRK and synuclein subtype-specific. Synuclein phosphorylation by GRK2 was weakly inhibited in the presence of calmodulin, whereas GRK5 phosphorylation of γ-synuclein was virtually unaffected. γ-Synuclein, on the other hand, is phosphorylated by CaMKII in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Thus, calmodulin activation in cells may lead to phosphorylation of different synuclein subtypes depending on which kinase is expressed in a particular cell type. Assuming that different synucleins have distinct functions, calmodulin-dependent synuclein phosphorylation may have different functional effects.GRKs appear to phosphorylate a single site in the C-tail of synucleins (Ser129 in α-, Ser118 in β-, and Ser124 in γ-synuclein, respectively). In α-synuclein, this is the same residue that is endogenously phosphorylated in 293 cells (18Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P. Haas C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In some synuclein subtypes, these sites can also be phosphorylated by other kinases, such as CK1, CK2, or CaMKII. C-terminal regions of synucleins vary significantly from each other. However, the serine residue phosphorylated by GRKs in synucleins appears to be rather conserved (Fig. 5 B). In all synucleins, this residue is surrounded by several acidic residues. Interestingly, earlier studies with peptide substrates suggested that GRKs may prefer different environments for the residues they use as substrates; GRK2 prefers an acidic environment, whereas GRK5 prefers an uncharged or possibly basic environment (13Kunapuli P. Onorato J.J. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1099-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to this notion, however, GRK5 phosphorylates α-synuclein as efficiently as GRK2. Nevertheless, both the surrounding residues and more distant parts of the molecule undoubtedly play an important role in determining substrate specificity of the kinase. For example, β-synuclein, which is most closely related to α-synuclein and which is a good substrate for GRK2, is a very poor substrate for CK2. Interestingly, phospholipids also stimulate GRK5 phosphorylation of residues in γ-synuclein and synoretin that are distinct from the residue phosphorylated by other kinases (Ser124). It seems likely that these additional phosphorylation sites are exposed when synucleins undergo a conformational change upon binding to liposomes. The identity and function of these sites is under investigation.Although the normal function of synuclein is not clear, some data indicate that synucleins may play a role in the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking and signaling. A recent report suggests that α-synuclein may be involved in desensitization of dopamine signaling (32Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.-H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M.G. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Mice lacking α-synuclein display a standard pattern of dopamine discharge and reuptake in response to simple electrical stimulation. However, they exhibit an increased release with paired stimuli, supporting the idea that α-synuclein is a negative regulator of dopamine neurotransmission, possibly by modulating the refilling rate of the readily releasable synaptic vesicles. This modulation may involve either a direct interaction of synuclein with vesicles or regulation of an enzyme activity such as PLD2. Here we demonstrated that GRK-mediated phosphorylation inhibits both synuclein's ability to interact with lipids and modulate the activity of PLD2. It is likely that the reduction in synuclein's ability to inhibit PLD2 is due to the reduced affinity of phosphorylated synuclein for phospholipids. One can speculate about the possible role of GRK-mediated synuclein phosphorylation in signal regulation. PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to form phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol. Phosphatidic acid has been shown to stimulate vesicle formation (33Jones D. Morgan C. Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Increased PLD2 activity also causes rearrangement of cortical actin cytoskeleton (15Colley W.C. Sung T.-C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller E. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Both of these processes are involved in receptor endocytosis and/or recycling. Thus, activated receptors, which in turn can activate GRKs, get phosphorylated and targeted for endocytosis. Activated GRKs can also phosphorylate synuclein, thus releasing inhibition of PLD2. Activation of PLD2 causes rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and vesicle formation aiding in receptor endocytosis and/or recycling.An additional mechanism by which synuclein phosphorylation might be linked to regulation of cytoskeleton comes from a recent report that α-synuclein can bind to tau protein and promote tau phosphorylation by protein kinase A (34Jensen P.H. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Højrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Tau is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Interestingly, the synuclein residue that is phosphorylated by GRKs (and CKs) lies inside the region (residues 87–140) that interacts with tau. Thus, it is possible that synuclein phosphorylation affects its interaction with tau and alters the dynamics of microtubule assembly. GRK phosphorylation of tubulin may also directly affect tubulin cytoskeleton formation. The findings that GRKs can directly interact with cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and actin (3Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G.

Biochem. 1998; 255: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the identification of synucleins as GRK substrates suggest an important role for GRKs in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. Identification of novel GRK substrates may help us discover yet unknown cellular functions for these kinases. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs)1 are involved in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (1Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). GRKs specifically recognize and phosphorylate agonist-occupied GPCRs. Receptor phosphorylation and subsequent binding of another protein, arrestin, uncouples activated receptor from G protein. These events can also promote receptor endocytosis. Internalized receptors are then either dephosphorylated and recycled back to the cell surface or targeted to lysosomes for degradation. The seven mammalian GRKs that have been identified can be divided into three subfamilies based on their overall structural organization and homology: GRK1 (rhodopsin kinase) and GRK7; GRK2 (βARK1) and GRK3 (βARK2); and GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6.

Interestingly, GRK-mediated phosphorylation of tubulin appears to be stimulated by β2-adrenergic receptor activation (3Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.G. Hester S. Miller S.

In addition, GRK6 appears to selectively phosphorylate the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor via a PDZ domain-mediated interaction (6Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T.

Although the physiological role for GRK-mediated phosphorylation of tubulin and the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor is unclear at present, these examples suggest that GRKs may have a broader substrate selectivity than previously assumed and thus play a wider role in signaling than previously appreciated. In this study, we explored the possibility that additional nonreceptor GRK substrates exist. In our search for such substrates, we identified synucleins as a novel family of GRK substrates. Synucleins have been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and may be involved in regulating intracellular vesicular traff"

A search for CAAX box proteins from Swiss-Prot revealed more than 300 peptides. Of these, the centromeric proteins CENP-E and CENP-F are preferentially expressed during mitosis and are implicated as mediators of the G2 → M checkpoint. Experiments performed here show that peptides from the COOH-terminal CAAX box of CENP-E and CENP-F are substrates for farnesyl transferase but not geranylgeranyl transferase-I. Although both proteins are prenylated in the human tumor cell line DLD-1, their prenylation is completely inhibited by the farnesyl transferase inhibitor, SCH 66336. Immunohistochemical data with the lung carcinoma cell line, A549, showed that preventing the farnesylation of CENP-E and CENP-F by treatment with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor SCH 66336 does not affect their localization to the kinetochores. However, the presence of farnesyl transferase inhibitors alters the association between CENP-E and the microtubules. Our results imply that the inhibition of CENP-E farnesylation results in the alteration of the microtubule-centromere interaction during mitosis and results in the accumulation of cells prior to metaphase.

Thus, the antitumor effects of FTIs in sensitive hTCLs with K-ras or N-ras mutations may be independent of effects on K-ras or N-ras function. A critical hint to additional biological effects of FTIs was obtained from cell cycle studies showing that most cell lines that are sensitive to FTI treatment accumulate in the G2 → M phase of the cell cycle.2 A protein that is farnesylated and contributes to cell cycle progression would be an appropriate candidate for mediating this biological effect. Since all farnesylated proteins end in a CAAX sequence (where C is a cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is a methionine, glutamine, serine, or threonine), a data base search was performed to identify CAAX box proteins that could potentially be important for the G2 → M transition or during mitosis. Of the hundreds of potentially farnesylated peptides that were identified from Swiss-Prot, two proteins, CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin, were previously associated with mitosis (19–37). Specifically, a role for both CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin prior to the metaphase-anaphase transition was previously suggested (20Yen T.J. Compton D.J. Wise D. Zinkowski R.P. Brinkley B.R. Earnshaw W.C.

Rieder and others have clearly shown the existence of a spindle checkpoint or a kinetochore attachment checkpoint prior to metaphase progression. This checkpoint appears to monitor the interaction of chromosomes with the spindle microtubules, and chromosomes that fail to attach to the spindle appear to inhibit sister chromatid separation at least transiently (38Gorbsky G.J.

It was demonstrated that sister chromatid separation is defective when CENP-E function is blocked by microinjection of affinity-purified antibodies to CENP-E (23Lombillo V.A. Nislow C. Yen T.J. Gelfand V.I. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 28Wood K.W. Sakowitz R. Goldstein L.S.B. Cleveland D.W.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). CENP-F/mitosin, which is one of the first proteins that associates with the kinetochores in prophase, is expressed only during mitosis and is rapidly degraded thereafter (34Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Mack G. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These findings signify the importance of functional CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin during mitosis and make them ideal candidate proteins for FTI targets. A detailed study was performed on CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin to determine whether these proteins were substrates for the enzyme FPT in vitro and in vivo and to determine whether prenylation had a role in the function of the two proteins. The hTCLs, A549, and NCI-H460 (derived from lung carcinomas), MIA Pa Ca-2 (derived from pancreatic carcinoma), and DLD-1 (derived from colon carcinoma) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained according to their recommendation. The farnesyl transferase inhibitor SCH 66336 was described previously (16Njoroge F.G. Vibulbhan B. Rane D.F. Bishop W.R. Petrin J. Patton R. Bryant M.S. Chen K.J. Nomeir A.A. Lin C.C. Liu M. King I.

To collect total protein, cells grown in appropriate medium were washed with PBS and scraped off of 10-cm dishes. After one more wash with PBS, the cell pellets were resuspended in a 1× protease inhibitor mixture mix (Complete Tablets from Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1% Nonidet P-40 was added to the pellets. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the pellets were sonicated, and the insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay from Pierce. 6 or 8% gels were used to detect CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin from 60 μg of total protein. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes overnight at 20 V and 4 °C and probed with the specific antibodies. For CENP-F/mitosin, the mitosin antibody from Transduction Laboratories was diluted 1:1000. For CENP-E, a polyclonal antibody was synthesized by immunizing two rabbits (SYNPEP Corp., Dublin, CA). This antibody was diluted 1:1000. For actin, the ascites fluid (Ab-1 antibody; Oncogene Research Products) was diluted 1:500. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs. For FACs analysis 0.5–1 × 106 cells were grown in 10-cm tissue culture plates with or without 1 μm SCH 66336. After 72 h, cells were collected from the culture medium. These were mixed with cells from the tissue culture plate after trypsinization. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 70% methanol for 30 min at 4 °C, and stained directly with propidium iodide solution (0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml RNase A). 10,000 stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer and analyzed using MODFIT LT (Verity Software Inc.) Biotinylated peptides derived from the carboxyl terminus of Ha-Ras, a mutant form of lamin B (CAIM → CAIL), CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin were synthesized by SYNPEP. The sequences for the peptides are as follows: Ha-Ras, biotin-DESGPGCMSCKCVLS; mutant lamin B, biotin-SGSGYRASNRSCAIL; CENP-E, biotin-GKDVPECKTQ; CENP-F, biotin-SKGSENCKVQ. Biotinylated peptides were used as substrates to detect the transfer of the [3H]isoprenyl group from the farnesyl pyrophosphate or the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in the presence of purified recombinant human FPT or GGPT-I in vitro as described previously (18Zhang F.L. Kirschmeier P. Carr D. James L. Bond R.W. Wang L. Patton R. Windsor W.T. Syto R. Zhang R. Bishop W.R. J. Biol.

After a 35-min incubation, peptides were collected with streptavidin-coated beads and the incorporation of [3H]isoprene was detected using the scintillation proximity assay. Ha-Ras, which is a substrate for FPT but not GGPT-I, and a mutant lamin B peptide, which is a substrate for GGPT-I but not FPT, were used as controls. A549 cells (control (untreated), and cells treated with 1 μm 66336 for 4 days) were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, washed three times with PBS, and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 to permeablize cells. After three washes with PBS, they were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and subsequently incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. They were also stained with propidium iodide solution (0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml RNase A). After five washes in PBS and one wash in water, cells were immobilized in elvanol and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (× 1000). For CENP-F/mitosin, a monoclonal antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. For CENP-E, a polyclonal antibody to the peptide LRRSQQAQDTSVISEHTDPQPSNKPL, near the COOH terminus of CENP-E, was synthesized by immunizing two rabbits (SYNPEP Corp., Dublin, CA). The antibodies from the two rabbits (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers 12,500 and 10,500, while titer from preimmune serum was <50) were pooled together and affinity-purified by the manufacturer. For immunohistochemistry, the affinity-purified CENP-E antibody was diluted 1:300, and the mitosin antibody was diluted 1:100. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from ICN chemicals and used according to the manufacturer's specifications. pMev-DLD-1, DLD-1 cells expressing a mevalonate transporter gene (15Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J. J. Biol.

The culture medium was then replaced with culture medium with 10% dialyzed FBS containing 1 μm SCH 66336 (or Me2SO for control cells), 150 μCi/ml [3H]mevalonolactone, and 20 μm mevastatin to metabolically label prenylated proteins overnight. After washing twice with cold PBS, the cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease inhibitors. The primary CENP-F/mitosin antibody was added to the total protein lysate along with protein G/protein A-Sepharose beads, and the tubes with the lysate were rotated for 2 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice before sample buffer was added. The samples were boiled in water bath and loaded on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The gels were dried on a Whatman paper after electrophoresis and viewed by autoradiography. The lysate depleted of CENP-F/mitosin was used for detection of labeled CENP-E and subsequently for K-Ras using the antibody K-Ras (F-234) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A549, NCI-H460, and MIA Pa Ca-2 cells were grown for 3 days without and with 1 μm SCH 66336. Microtubule-associated proteins were isolated from these human tumor cell lines using the previously described method for high microtubule-associated protein (MAP) content (45Keates R.A.B. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) after two cycles of depolymerization-polymerization of the microtubules. The depolymerization of the microtubules was achieved by incubation on ice. This was followed by polymerization of the microtubules at 32 °C in the presence of GTP, PEP, and pyruvate kinase as described previously (45Keates R.A.B. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The microtubule-associated proteins were used for Western blot analysis of CENP-E and for silver staining using the Silver XPress kit from NOVEX. To identify farnesylated proteins that could contribute to a G2 → M pause, the FINDPATTERNS algorithm was used to obtain proteins with CAAX boxes at their COOH-terminal ends from the Swiss-Prot data base. This search revealed more than 300 CAAX box peptide sequences that could potentially be prenylated. Three of these proteins, CENP-E, CENP-F, and mitosin, with CAAX boxes CKTQ, CKVQ, and CKVQ, are known to be kinetochore-binding proteins that are expressed during mitosis (28Wood K.W. Sakowitz R. Goldstein L.S.B. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar,33Rattner J.B. Rao A. Fritzler M.J. Valencia D.W. Yen T.J Cell Motil.

All three are expressed in a cell cycle dependent fashion, are transiently associated with kinetochores/centromeres during mitosis, and regulate progression through the G2 → M checkpoint (19Pennisi E. Science. 1998; 279: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A protein pileup for CENP-F and mitosin revealed that they have identical amino acid sequences, except for a stretch of 96 amino acids that is missing in mitosin. Thus, the two proteins may be products of alternatively spliced transcripts from the same gene, and since we do not distinguish between the two forms, we refer to them as CENP-F/mitosin. The fact that CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin have CAAX boxes and the fact that they play a role in G2 → M progression suggest that these proteins may be important in mediating some of the cell cycle changes induced by FTIs. To determine whether CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin were substrates for FPT and GGPT-I, biotinylated peptides from the COOH-terminal ends of CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin were synthesized. The peptides were tested as substrates for FPT and GGPT-I using 3H-labeled farnesyl pyrophospate and3H-labeled geranylgeranyl pyrophospate, respectively, as isoprene donors. A COOH-terminal Ha-Ras peptide and a mutated lamin B peptide (in which the CAAX box CAIM was changed to CAIL) were used as controls for farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, respectively. Both peptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal CAAX sequences of CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin were substrates for FPT (Fig.1 A). The apparent Km of CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin for FPT was approximately 200 nm as compared with the Ha-Ras peptide, which has a Km of approximately 550 nm. This indicates that in vitro, the COOH-terminal peptides of both CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin had higher affinity for FPT than the synthetic Ha-Ras peptide. Significantly, the CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin peptides were not substrates for GGPT-I in vitro. As expected, the mutated lamin B peptide was a good substrate for GGPT-I under the same conditions, indicating that the enzyme was functional in the experiments (Fig. 1 B). These results suggested that CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin may not be in vivo substrates for GGPT-I. This is in contrast to K-Ras and N-Ras, which were shown to be substrates for both GGPT and FPT in vitro (18Zhang F.L. Kirschmeier P. Carr D. James L. Bond R.W. Wang L. Patton R. Windsor W.T. Syto R. Zhang R. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In vivo, K-Ras and N-Ras are farnesylated proteins, but in FTI-treated cells these proteins are alternatively prenylated by GGPT-I (14James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 15Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The prenylation of CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin was examined in pMev-DLD-1 cells. Studying the prenylation pattern of endogenous proteins is difficult in human tumor cell lines, where incorporation of mevalonate is limited. pMev-DLD-1 is a cell line developed to increase the incorporation of mevalonate (15Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In addition, for this experiment, antibodies were required to immunoprecipitate endogenous CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin from the pMev-DLD-1 cells. The CENP-F/mitosin antibody was commercially available. The CENP-E antibody was generated against a peptide from the COOH-terminal region of CENP-E as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blot analysis performed with the affinity-purified CENP-E antibody revealed a band migrating at ∼250 kDa in HCT 116 (Fig. 2 A) and all other human tumor cell lines that were tested (data not shown) as reported earlier (23Lombillo V.A. Nislow C. Yen T.J. Gelfand V.I. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The antibody was shown to be specific for CENP-E because incubation with the peptide blocked immunoreactivity (Fig.2 A). pMev-DLD-1 cells were grown in the presence of 3H-labeled mevalonolactone (precursor for both the farnesyl and the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) and mevastatin (which prevents the synthesis of cellular mevalonate) in the presence and in the absence of the FTI. Protein lysates collected from the cells were immunoprecipitated with mitosin antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig.2 B. 3H-Labeled mevalonate was incorporated into mitosin, indicating that it is a prenylated protein. However, the incorporation of the label from 3H mevalonolactone was completely blocked in the presence of a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, SCH 66336 (Fig. 2 B), indicating that CENP-F/mitosin is a farnesylated protein and not subject to alternative prenylation. Western analysis confirmed that CENP-F/mitosin was not repressed in FTI-treated cells (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the loss of signal was due to inhibition of prenylation and not due to a reduction in protein expression. CENP-E was immunoprecipitated using the anti-CENP-E antibody from the protein lysate that had been depleted of mitosin and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Like CENP-F, CENP-E was not repressed by FTI treatment (Fig. 2 C), and CENP-E also incorporated 3H-labeled mevalonate only in the absence of FTI (Fig. 2 B). To ensure that 3H-labeled mevalonolate was incorporated in FTI-treated p-Mev-DLD-1, K-Ras, which is alternatively prenylated in the presence of FTIs, was immunoprecipitated from the same lysate. As expected, K-Ras was labeled in both untreated and FTI-treated cells (Fig. 2 B) (15Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). These results confirm that in whole cells, both CENP-E and CENP-F/mitosin are farnesylated proteins, and it is important to note that the presence of the FTI does not lead to the alternative prenylation of either CENP-E or CENP-F/mitosin in cells. The lung carcinoma cells, A549, which harbor a K-ras mutation, were shown to be sensitive to the effects of FTIs (2Nagasu T. Yoshimatsu K. Rowell C. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M.

To evaluate the ability of SCH 66336 to alter the cell cycle distribution, flow cytometry was performed on A549 cells in the presence of SCH 66336. As observed earlier with human tumor cells lacking Ha-ras mutations, A549 cells treated with 1 μmSCH 66336 pause in the G2 → M phase (Fig.3 and Ref. 1Moasser M.M. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Kohl N.E. Oliff A.

After 60 h of treatment with 1 μm SCH 66336, 25% cells are in G2 → M as compared with 9% in untreated control cells, indicating that in the presence of FTIs the cells are unable to progress through mitosis normally. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the precise stage of the mitotic pause. Cells were stained with propidium iodide to identify mitotic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2134190459,"It is generally accepted that the colors displayed by living organisms are determined by low molecular weight pigments or chromoproteins that require a prosthetic group. The exception to this rule is green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria that forms a fluorophore by self-catalyzed protein backbone modification. Here we found a naturally nonfluorescent homolog of GFP to determine strong purple coloration of tentacles in the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata. Under certain conditions, this novel chromoprotein produces a trace amount of red fluorescence (emission lambda(max) = 595 nm). The fluorescence demonstrates unique behavior: its intensity increases in the presence of green light but is inhibited by blue light. The quantum yield of fluorescence can be enhanced dramatically by single amino acid replacement, which probably restores the ancestral fluorescent state of the protein. Other fluorescent variants of the novel protein have emission peaks that are red-shifted up to 610 nm. They demonstrate that long wavelength fluorescence is attainable in GFP-like fluorescent proteins."

The HS chains interact with a large number of different molecules primarily in the extracellular space (e.g. growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and enzymes). Some of these molecules recognize a specific pattern of sulfate groups, which are added to the HS chain during biosynthesis (5Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A spatially and temporally regulated biosynthesis will therefore indirectly determine the localization of other molecules, such as growth factors/cytokines, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, and extracellular matrix components (6Lindahl U.

The biosynthesis of HS is a complex process, involving polymerization and concomitant modification, including sulfation, of the chain (5Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

The product of the polymerization reactions is a polysaccharide consisting of repeating d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. The first modification step is N-deacetylation andN-sulfation of selected GlcNAc units, carried out by the bifunctional enzymeN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST). Because all further modifications occur in the vicinity ofN-sulfated GlcN units (5Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

Four related NDSTs, NDST-1–NDST-4, have been identified (8Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

The lack of NDST-2 does not affect normal life span and fertility, but NDST-2-deficient mice display a severe mast cell defect, caused by a complete lack of sulfated heparin in the secretory granules.

Kjellén, unpublished observations.of NDST-2-deficient mice did not reveal any structural alterations in the polysaccharide. The lack of HS defects in NDST-2-deficient mice indicates that other NDSTs are more important in HS biosynthesis or that these isoforms are able to compensate for the lack of NDST-2. In the present paper, we describe the generation of NDST-1-deficient mice. It is demonstrated that NDST-1, in contrast, plays a critical role in HS biosynthesis in most parts of the body. Furthermore, it is shown that a lack of normally sulfated HS leads to a fully penetrant abnormality of the lungs. The lung phenotype of NDST-1-deficient mice was recently described by Fan et al. (27Fan G. Xiao L. Cheng L. Wang X. Sun B. Hu G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed incomplete penetrance of defects of the skull and the eyes and that a minor proportion of the NDST-1-deficient embryos die during the embryonic period. A genomic clone containing the 5′ end of the NDST-1 gene was isolated from a bacteriophage mouse (strain 129/Sv) genomic library (Stratagene). A 7-kb SacI/KpnI fragment located 3′ of exon 1 was subcloned into a bluescript plasmid (BSIIKS+, Stratagene) to serve as a long arm of homology to the NDST-1 locus. Subsequently, a PGK-neo cassette was inserted into a SalI/XhoI site 5′ of the SacI/KpnI fragment in the opposite direction relative to the transcription of the NDST-1 gene. Finally, a 3.1-kbBamHI fragment located 5′ of the coding region in exon 1 was ligated upstream of the PGK-neo cassette to create a second arm of homology to the endogenous gene. Following homologous recombination, a deletion of the first 513 nucleotides of the coding region of the NDST-1 gene is created. The targeting vector was linearized at aNotI site and electroporated into R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells (28Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). G418 (350 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to select for cells that had taken up the targeting vector. Clones that had undergone homologous recombination (3 of 360 clones) were identified by Southern blot analysis using an external 0.4-kbSacI/XbaI fragment as probe (Fig. 1 A). These were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and chimeric male founder mice from two of the clones were shown to transmit the mutation to the offspring when crossed with C57BL/6 females. Tail biopsies were genotyped as described (29Fässler R. Meyer M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and heterozygous mice were intercrossed to produce NDST-1-deficient mice. Phenotypical studies were performed on mice with mixed genetic background (129/SvJ/Sv and C57BL/6). Total RNA from lung and liver was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (9Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a cDNA probe spanning nucleotides 1–435 of the mouse NDST-1 coding region. Embryos were embedded in Tissue-Tek (Miles Inc.) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Six-μm sections were cut using a cryostat. Tissue sections were stained with the antibodies HepSS-1 (Seikagaku) and RB4CB9 (30Jenniskens G.J. Oosterhof A. Brandwijk R. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4099-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which recognize epitopes in HS, and antibodies against surfactant proteins (SPs) A and B. For RB4CB9, stainings were performed as described previously for other HS-recognizing phage display antibodies (31van Kuppevelt T.H. Dennissen M.A. van Venrooij W.J. Hoet R.M. Veerkamp J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12960-12966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For HepSS-1, tissue sections were rehydrated for 5 min in 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline (Tween/phosphate-buffered saline), blocked with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tween/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and incubated with HepSS-1 primary antibody diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer for 90 min at room temperature. The HepSS-1 primary antibody was detected by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. After each incubation, sections were washed three times for 10 min each in Tween/phosphate-buffered saline. For SP-A and SP-B, stainings were performed as described previously (32Wong C.J. Akiyama J. Allen L. Hawgood S. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 930-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were prepared from minced and trypsin treated E14.5 embryos, essentially as described previously (33Abbondanzo S.J. Gadi I. Stewart C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 803-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and stored at –70 °C. After thawing, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mix (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum and passaged once before use. Subconfluent fibroblast cultures were preincubated 1–2 days in low glucose medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the addition of 5% fetal calf serum) and then metabolically labeled for 25 h with 250 μCi of [3H]glucosamine in 5 ml of the same medium. The medium fractions were applied to DEAE-Sephacel columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100.

The resultant 3H-labeled HS chains were recovered in the void volume after gel filtration on a column (100 × 0.5 cm) of Sephadex G-50 (superfine grade, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Isolated [3H]HS (∼8000 cpm) was applied to a MonoQ ion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, with a NaCl gradient ranging from 0.3 to 1.5m. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed for3H radioactivity. 3H-Labeled capsular polysaccharide from E. coli K5 (a gift from U. Lindahl, Uppsala University), with the same (GlcUAβ1–4GlcNAcα1–4) n structure as the initial polymerization product in HS biosynthesis, was used as a standard. Isolated [3H]HS preparations from fibroblast cultures were cleaved atN-sulfated GlcN residues by deamination at pH 1.5 (35Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The resultant 3H-labeled oligosaccharides were separated by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 140 cm) of Bio-Gel P-10 (fine grade, Bio-Rad). Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Hematoxylin and eosin stainings followed standard protocols. NDST-1-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting in ES cells. A targeting vector designed to create a functional mutation was constructed (Fig. 1 A). Following homologous recombination, 2 kb of the gene, including the first 171 amino acids comprising both the cytoplasmic and trans-Golgi membrane domains, are deleted. The vector was electroporated into R1 ES cells (28Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar), and clones that had undergone homologous recombination were identified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1 B) using the external probe indicated in Fig. 1 A. Three of 360 analyzed clones contained the targeted allele and were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, giving rise to highly chimeric animals. Germ line transmission of the mutation was achieved from two of the clones. No apparent defects were observed in heterozygous animals. Genotype analysis of embryos from heterozygous crossings at E18.5 showed a ratio of 33% wild type, 50% heterozygous, and 17% homozygous embryos (n = 305, p = 0.05), indicating that a minor proportion of the NDST-1-deficient embryos die during the prenatal period, whereas most NDST-1-deficient individuals survive the embryonic period. To confirm a correct targeting event of the wild type allele, Northern blot analysis of E18.5 embryos was performed (Fig. 1 C). The expected 8-kb transcript was present in wild type animals, but it was absent in homozygous individuals. In order to analyze the role of NDST-1 in HS biosynthesis, sections of embryos (E18.5) were stained with two different antibodies, HepSS-1 and RB4CB9, that recognize HS. Both antibodies specifically bind to HS; the RB4CB9 antibody was recently characterized and is dependent on N-sulfated GlcN-residues for epitope recognition (30Jenniskens G.J. Oosterhof A. Brandwijk R. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4099-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as is the HepSS-1 antibody. Both RB4CB9 and HepSS-1 antibodies systemically stained most BMs in wild type animals. For example, HS recognized by the RB4CB9 antibody was present in BMs of lung, liver, and kidney from wild type animals (Fig. 2, A, E, andI). With the exception of some blood vessels, this antibody showed no positive staining in mutant lung and liver (Fig. 2,B and F). In wild type kidney, the antibody strongly recognized HS in Bowman's capsule BM and HS in the BMs of tubuli or collecting ducts, whereas the staining of the glomerular BM was more diffuse. In mutant kidney, the staining was lost in the BMs of Bowman's capsule and glomerulus, but a weak staining, compared with wild type, was still present in the BMs of tubuli or collecting ducts (Fig. 2 J). HepSS-1 showed the same staining pattern as RB4CB9 in the wild type tissues (Fig. 2, C, G, andK) and left no or only very weak traces of staining in a few BMs (Fig. 2, D, H, and L). Structural analysis of [3H]glucosamine-labeled HS from cultured embryonic fibroblasts (E14.5) further supported these observations. A clearly reduced charge density of HS in cultured fibroblasts from NDST-1–/– embryos compared with wild type fibroblasts was evident, indicating a lowered sulfation of HS from mutant mice (Fig.3 A). Similar results were obtained with [3H]glucosamine-labeled HS isolated from embryonic liver and lung (E18.5; data not shown). To study the degree of N-sulfation, the 3H-labeled HS preparations from fibroblasts were treated with nitrous acid at pH 1.5, followed by gel chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10 (Fig. 3 B). During nitrous acid treatment, the polysaccharide chain is cleaved atN-sulfated glucosamine units; the extent of depolymerization thus correlates with the degree of N-sulfation. Calculations based on peak areas indicated that the degree of N-sulfation was lowered from >40% in HS from NDST-1+/+ fibroblasts to <15% in NDST-1–/– HS (Fig. 3 B). HS from NDST-1+/– fibroblasts was indistinguishable from wild type HS (data not shown).Figure 3Structural analysis of fibroblast HS.A, analytical ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ of [3H]HS from NDST-1+/+ (○) and NDST-1–/– (●) fibroblasts.

When litters from heterozygous crossings were genotyped at P21, however, no homozygous mice could be identified, indicating perinatal (or early postnatal) lethality. When observed at birth, pups that later were shown to be NDST-1-deficient attempted to breathe but remained cyanotic and died neonatally. Lungs from these newborn NDST-1–/– animals were severely atelectatic (Fig.4 B), whereas lungs from surviving pups, which always were wild type (Fig. 4 A) or heterozygous (not shown) for the mutation, were inflated. Immunohistochemical staining of E18.5 lung sections for SP-A and SP-B suggests an altered homeostasis of both surfactant proteins in NDST-1-deficient embryos (Fig. 4, C and D; shown only for SP-A); although less secreted surfactant appeared to be present in lungs of NDST-1–/– embryos, an increased number of the cells producing these proteins could be noted. Because we had indications that a minor proportion of NDST-1-deficient embryos die during the embryonic period, pups were genotyped at E9.5–E 14.5. At these stages, the expected Mendelian ratio was found: 20% wild type, 55% heterozygous, 25% mutant embryos (n = 148,p = 0.05) indicating lethality between E14.5 and E18.5. We have by homologous recombination in ES cells created mice deficient in NDST-1. Structural analysis of HS from cultured fibroblasts from NDST-1+/+ and NDST-1–/–embryos demonstrated that the N-sulfation of HS in these cells was greatly reduced (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained when metabolically [3H]glucosamine-labeled HS from embryonic (E18.5) liver and lung was studied (data not shown). Immunostainings using monoclonal antibodies against HS illustrated that a structural alteration of HS occurs in most BMs of the embryo (Fig. 2). In contrast, indistinguishable immunostaining patterns in wild type and mutant embryos were obtained for the BM-components nidogen-1, laminin γ1-chain, and perlecan (not shown), indicating no severe structural alteration in BMs. It is interesting to note that whereas the HepSS-1 staining is uniformly absent or very weak in BMs of mutants in lung, liver and kidney, the RB4CB9 staining is still left in some blood vessels and in some kidney structures. These results demonstrate that the two antibodies recognize different HS epitopes, even if N-sulfation is required for both. More importantly, the different stainings indicate a selective alteration of HS structure in the mutant animals. In addition to HepSS-1 and RB4CB9, a panel of HS recognizing phage display antibodies 3T. van Kuppevelt, unpublished observations. were also tested (not shown). The staining patterns observed with these antibodies confirmed that some structural epitopes had been lost in the mutant, whereas some still remained, indicating that different isoforms of NDST might be expressed in a fine-tuned manner in different cell populations. The rapid death after birth of the NDST-1–/– pups and the observation that newborn homozygous pups gasp for air and turn cyanotic indicate lung failure as the primary cause of the neonatal lethality. Examination of histological sections from both neonates and E18.5 embryos further supported this idea. Atelectasia seen in lungs from NDST-1–/– pups indicated that their lungs had never been properly inflated (Fig. 4 B). Even though breathing reflexes are present, the possibility cannot be fully excluded that the respiratory failure may be due to disturbances in the brain stem region. The compact structure of the lungs from NDST-1-deficient embryos indicates that they contain an elevated number of cells. Immunostainings using antibodies against SP-A (Fig. 4, C andD) and SP-B (data not shown) indeed support this notion. Interestingly, overproliferation of type II epithelial cells has been observed in vitro as a consequence of undersulfated HS (36Sannes P.L. Khosla J. Li C.M. Pagan I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L701-708PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, differentiation of these cells seems to be delayed because extracellular deposits of surfactant are less frequently observed in NDST-1-deficient embryos compared with their wild type littermates. The condition of the NDST-1-deficient newborns therefore resembles the respiratory distress syndrome seen in premature infants (37Avery M.E. Mead J. Am. J. Dis. Child. 1959; 97: 17-23Google Scholar). This observation is in accordance with a recent report describing NDST-1 mutant mice (27Fan G. Xiao L. Cheng L. Wang X. Sun B. Hu G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, we found, in addition, that a minor proportion of our HS-defective mice died during the embryonic period. Discrepancies might be due to differences in the genetic background of the embryos. Alternatively, the sulfation degree of HS, not investigated by Fan et al. (27Fan G. Xiao L. Cheng L. Wang X. Sun B. Hu G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), might differ in the two strains. The phenotype of NDST-1-deficient mice differs from that of mice lacking the HS 2-O-sulfotransferase gene (38Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), although a not fully penetrant eye defect may be similar between the strains. The 2-O-sulfotransferase-deficient mice are reported to die at a later time after birth than the NDST-1-deficient mice, due to bilateral renal agenesis and they also show skeletal abnormalities (38Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the core protein of the HS bearing proteoglycan perlecan display stress-sensitive BMs and develop exencephali and chondrodysplasia (39Costell M. Gustafsson E. Aszodi A. Mörgelin M. Bloch W. Hunziker E. Addicks K. Timpl R. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1109-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 40Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Watanabe H. Takami H. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Mice devoid of the cell surface HS proteoglycan glypican-3 show various phenotypes related to overgrowth (41Cano-Gauci D.F. Song H.H. Yang H. McKerlie C. Choo B. Shi W. Pullano R. Piscione T.D. Grisaru S. Soon S. Sedlackova L. Tanswell A.K. Mak T.W. Yeger H. Lockwood G.A. Rosenblum N.D. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which in some aspects resemble the human overgrowth condition Simpson-Behmel-Golabi syndrome, in which glypican-3 mutations have been found (42Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A. Baybayan P. Chen E.Y. Huber R. Neri G. Cao A. Forabosco A. Schlessinger D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Further demonstrations of the function of HS come from analysis of the autosomal dominant disorder hereditary multiple exostoses, caused by mutations in HS-polymerases (43McCormick C. Leduc Y. Martindale D. Mattison K. Esford L.E. Dyer A.P. Tufaro F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The condition of hereditary multiple exostoses is the most common cause of benign skeletal tumors in humans. In light of the many suggested functions ascribed to HS, it is surprising that NDST-1-deficient embryos carrying structurally altered HS in most parts of the body are able to complete the embryonic period with only minor histological defects. Genotype analysis of embryos at stage E18.5 showed, as mentioned, that a minor population of the NDST-1-deficient embryos die at an earlier stage during development. The cause of the embryonic lethality is still unclear, but we have observed not fully penetrant phenotypes of the skull and the eyes. As the number of individuals displaying morphological skull defects found among NDST-1-deficient embryos at each developmental stage is low, 4 of 21 at E14.5 and 7 of 52 at E18.5, we cannot, at this point, judge whether this is a reason for the lethality between these two stages. Although NDST-1 obviously is important for HS biosynthesis, NDST-2 appears to be involved primarily in heparin production (25Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellén L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 26Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, lack of both NDST-1 and NDST-2 in the mouse causes earlier developmental lethality, 4K. Holmborn and E. Forsberg, unpublished observations. indicating that NDST-2 might also be involved in HS biosynthesis and that NDST-2 may to a certain extent compensate for the loss of NDST-1 in NDST-1–/– mice. Further analysis of mice deficient in NDST-1 or NDST-2 and analysis of mice lacking both NDST-1 and NDST-2 will give more insights into the role of these two enzymes in HS biosynthesis. We thank A. Nagy for R1 ES cells, S. Hawgood for kindly providing us with SP-A and SP-B antibodies, M. Nord for valuable discussions, and P. Ekblom and U. Lindahl for helpful suggestions and support."

The products of these genes appear to be responsible for the DNA-joining events that complete DNA replication, genetic recombination, and DNA repair in mammalian cells. In the lower eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA ligases encoded by the CDC9 and DNL4 genes are functional homologs of the LIG1 and LIG4 genes. However, this organism apparently lacks a LIG3 gene homolog (2Barnes D.E. Johnston L.H. Kodama K. Tomkinson A.E. Lasko D.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been suggested that protein-protein interactions mediated by the unique regions flanking the catalytic domain determine the cellular functions of these enzymes. In support of this hypothesis, recent studies have identified specific protein partners for each of the LIG gene products. The non-catalytic N-terminal domain of DNA ligase I interacts with both proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DNA polymerase β, implicating this species of DNA ligase in DNA replication and excision repair pathways (6Dimitriadis E.K.

In contrast, the non-catalytic C-terminal extensions of DNA ligases IIIα and IV contain BRCT motifs (8Wei Y.-F. Robins P. Carter K. Caldecott K. Pappin D.J.C., Yu, G.-L. Wang R.-P. Shell B.K.

The single BRCT motif of DNA ligase IIIα mediates complex formation with the DNA repair protein XRCC1, linking this species of DNA ligase with base excision repair and the repair of DNA single-strand breaks (11Caldecott K.W.

The initial symptoms of the individual with DNA ligase I deficiency were recurrent infections caused by severe combined immunodeficiency (17Webster A.D.B. Barnes D.E. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Lindahl T. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1508-1509Abstract PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cell lines established from this patient exhibited defects in Okazaki fragment joining and sensitivity to a wide range of DNA-damaging agents, a phenotype consistent with the predicted role of DNA ligase I in DNA replication and excision repair (18Prigent C.

Res. 1983; 107: 371-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When the DNA ligase I-deficient cells were activated for V(D)J recombination by ectopic expression of the RAG proteins, there was no apparent defect in this type of recombination (20Hsieh C.L.

Gellert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).The individual with a mutated LIG4 gene presented with leukemia. Unfortunately, attempts to treat this disease with chemotherapy and then ionizing radiation caused a severe reaction (16Riballo E. Critchlow S.E. Teo S.-H. Doherty A.J. Priestly A. Broughton B.

The extreme radiosensitivity of cell lines established from this individual is consistent with the predicted role of DNA ligase IV in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by NHEJ. Surprisingly, the DNA ligase IV-deficient individual did not appear to be immunodeficient, and the DNA ligase IV-deficient cell line had no apparent defect in V(D)J recombination (16Riballo E.

Inactivation of the LIG4 gene either in human pre-B cells or in mouse embryonic fibroblasts abolishes V(D)J recombination (24Frank K.M. Sekiguchi J.M. Seidl K.J. Swat W. Rathbun G.A. Cheng H.L.

Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).The processes of NHEJ and V(D)J recombination involve the joining of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), whereas the ligation events that complete DNA replication and excision repair pathways occur at single-strand interruptions in duplex DNA. Thus, it is conceivable that the DNA ligases may exhibit preferences for either double- or single-strand breaks depending on the type of DNA transaction that they participate in. In this regard, it was demonstrated that bovine DNA ligases I and II could be discriminated by the ability of DNA ligase I to join blunt-ended DNA duplexes (26Arrand J.E. Willis A.E. Goldsmith I. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9079-9082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation provided the rationale for studies examining the influence of DNA ligase I on the spectrum of products produced by in vitro V(D)J recombination reactions (22Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T. Gellert M.

However, the initial biochemical studies on blunt-end joining were performed prior to the identification of DNA ligases III and IV (8Wei Y.-F. Robins P. Carter K. Caldecott K. Pappin D.J.C., Yu, G.-L. Wang R.-P. Shell B.K. Nash R.A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Haseltine W.A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3206-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Here we have purified the human DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex from baculovirus-infected insect cells and found that the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex binds specifically to the ends of duplex DNA molecules, a property shared with another NHEJ factor, the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (28Yaneva M. Kowaleski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these proteins do not compete for binding to DNA, but instead DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 associates with both Ku and the catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) of DNA-PK at the ends of DNA molecules. However, Ku and DNA-PKcs have markedly different effects on DNA joining by DNA ligase IV-XRCC4.DISCUSSIONGenetic studies in both yeast and mammals indicate that DNA ligase IV participates in NHEJ (3Schar P.

Schwartz K. Lieber M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA ligase IV also plays a critical role during V(D)J recombination in immune cells (24Frank K.M. Sekiguchi J.M. Seidl K.J. Swat W. Rathbun G.A. Cheng H.L. Davidson L. Kangaloo L. Alt F.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar,25Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S. Schwartz K. Lieber M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Both of these DNA transactions involve the end-to-end joining of duplex DNA molecules. In contrast, the enzymes encoded by theLIG1 and LIG3 genes complete DNA metabolic pathways, in which the final step is the sealing of a single-strand nick in duplex DNA (1Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, one might expect DNA ligase IV to preferentially join linear duplex DNA moleculesin vitro. However, efforts to characterize the biochemical properties of DNA ligase IV have been hindered by the low levels of this enzyme activity in mammalian cells and the instability of DNA ligase IV in the absence of its partner protein XRCC4 (32Bryans M. Valenzano M.C. Stamato T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 433: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 33Robins P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24257-24261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study, we have coexpressed human DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 in insect cells and purified an active complex of these proteins to near homogeneity.In agreement with published studies (27Ramsden A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Robins P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24257-24261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 was less active than either DNA ligase I or III with nicked DNA substrates. Previously, it has been shown that, in the presence of polyethylene glycol, DNA ligase I ligates blunt-ended DNA molecules, whereas DNA ligase II does not (26Arrand J.E. Willis A.E. Goldsmith I. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9079-9082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From this study, it has been inferred that DNA ligase I is the only mammalian DNA ligase capable of joining blunt ends and so is likely to be the enzyme completing NHEJ events involving blunt ends and signal-joint formation during V(D)J recombination (27Ramsden A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In fact, purified recombinant DNA ligases I and IIIβ and DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 all joined blunt-ended DNA molecules to a similar extent in the presence of polyethylene glycol, whereas only DNA ligase IIIβ generated detectable amounts of ligated product in the absence of polyethylene glycol. Analysis of DNA molecules repaired by NHEJ revealed that a significant proportion of these events appear to be mediated by short complementary sequences or microhomologies (37Roth D.B. Porter T.N. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2599-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This suggests that the ends of DNA molecules may be aligned by base pairing between short complementary single-strand sequences, presumably generated by limited nucleolytic degradation, and then ligated. Therefore, we compared the ability of the mammalian DNA ligases to join linear DNA molecules with cohesive ends. DNA ligase I was significantly less active than either DNA ligase IIIβ or DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 with this type of substrate.Since the mammalian DNA ligases catalyze phosphodiester bond formation by the same reaction mechanism (1Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the differences in DNA joining activity presumably reflect differences in DNA binding properties. In support of this idea, DNA ligase I does not bind to DNA at physiological salt concentrations, whereas the zinc finger of DNA ligase III allows this enzyme to bind to single- and double-strand breaks in DNA (7Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35Mackey Z.B. Niedergang C. Menissier-de Murcia J. Leppard J. Au K. Chen J. de Murcia G. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21679-21687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown recently that XRCC4 binds preferentially to DNA with nicks and ends, suggesting that this protein may mediate the binding of DNA ligase IV to DNA (41Modesti M. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2008-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Here we have shown by atomic force microscopy that the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex binds specifically to the ends of duplex DNA molecules and apparently prefers ends with single-strand overhangs. Furthermore, a single DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex was able to bind simultaneously to the complementary but non-ligatable ends of two DNA molecules. Although the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex could stabilize DNA molecules interacting via their complementary ends, it seems more likely that DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 is acting as a bridging factor, binding to the end of one molecule and then forming a stable complex with the complementary end of another molecule.Genetic studies in eukaryotes suggest that Ku and DNA ligase IV function in the same pathway (3Schar P. Herrman G. Daly G. Lindahl T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1912-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4Teo S.-H. Jackson S.P.

Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ku also binds to DNA ends and can act as a bridging factor between two DNA molecules (27Ramsden A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 42Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J. Bear G. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4267-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was reported that Ku stimulates the intermolecular joining of both blunt- and sticky-ended DNA molecules by DNA ligases I, III, and IV (27Ramsden A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The nonspecific stimulation of ligation by all the mammalian DNA ligases tested suggests that this effect is due to the structure formed by Ku and the DNA molecules rather than protein-protein interactions between Ku and the mammalian DNA ligases. However, the genetic studies predict that there should be a specific relationship between Ku and DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 (3Schar P. Herrman G. Daly G. Lindahl T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1912-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4Teo S.-H. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4788-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 5Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In our studies, Ku inhibited intramolecular ligation of DNA molecules with cohesive ends. This inhibition could not be explained by Ku preventing DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 from interacting with DNA. Instead, DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 and Ku were able to bind to the same DNA end. Recent studies on the initial binding of Ku to DNA by cross-linking suggest that the DNA end is exposed (43Yoo S. Kimzey A. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20034-20039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), so the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex may still be interacting with the terminal nucleotides. This association between Ku and DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 at the ends of DNA molecules, which is consistent with the previous observation that XRCC4 stimulates DNA binding by Ku (44Leber R. Wise T.W. Mizuta R. Meek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1794-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), presumably prevents DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 from interacting productively with two DNA ends.Analysis of the DNA-PK complex assembled at a DNA end by cross-linking revealed that Ku is shifted away from the DNA end by about one helical turn, with DNA-PKcs binding closest to the DNA end (45Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4679-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it appears likely that, in vivo, DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 interacts with DNA ends bound by DNA-PKcs. Here we have shown that DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 and DNA-PKcs were able to bind simultaneously to the same DNA end. Unlike Ku, DNA-PKcs did not markedly inhibit ligation by DNA ligase IV-XRCC4. Intriguingly, the addition of DNA-PKcs resulted in a significant fraction of the ligation products being generated by intermolecular ligation events, whereas reactions with DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 alone produced predominantly intramolecular ligation products. To explain intramolecular ligation, we suggest that the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex first binds to a DNA end and then finds the second end by random diffusion. For relatively short molecules, this random process favors interactions with the other end of the same DNA molecule. In support of this model, decreasing the length of the linear DNA substrate from 3 kb to 400 bp increased the proportion of ligated product generated by intramolecular ligation (compare Figs.2 B and 8). To explain the stimulation of intermolecular ligation by DNA-PKcs, we suggest that DNA-PKcs-containing complexes formed at DNA ends have affinity for each other. The specific association of DNA ends via protein-protein interactions would favor intermolecular interactions and therefore promote intermolecular ligation.Recently, it has been reported that extracts of human lymphoblastoid cells catalyze DNA end joining in a reaction that is dependent upon DNA ligase IV-XRCC4, Ku, and DNA-PKcs (46Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the majority of the end-joining events catalyzed by these extracts were intermolecular. When we incubated both subunits of DNA-PK with DNA ligase IV-XRCC4, intramolecular ligation was inhibited, as it was in reactions with Ku, but intermolecular joining still occurred. Since the distribution of reaction products generated by purified Ku, DNA-PKcs, and DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 is similar to that observed in assays with the cell extract (46Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), we conclude that intermolecular joining of DNA molecules with cohesive ends can be carried out in vitro by DNA-PK and DNA ligase IV-XRCC4. However, there is compelling evidence that the DNA-PK end-joining reaction mediated by DNA-PK in vivo is more complex. First, the reaction catalyzed by the cell extract was sensitive to wortmannin (46Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), whereas the reconstituted reaction was not. Second, fractionation of the cell extract revealed the participation of factors in addition to DNA-PK and DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 in the end-joining reaction (46Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Finally, genetic studies in yeast have implicated other proteins such as the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex in Ku-dependent DSB repair (47Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar).In summary, we have shown that the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex binds specifically to DNA ends and acts as an alignment factor, holding together the short complementary single-strand ends of linear duplex DNA molecules. Both of these properties are consistent with the predicted role of this enzyme in NHEJ and V(D)J recombination. Furthermore, DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 associates with the Ku and DNA-PKcs subunits of DNA-PK to form specific complexes at DNA ends. However, Ku and DNA-PKcs have markedly different effects on DNA end joining by DNA ligase IV-XRCC4. Ku inhibits intramolecular DNA joining, whereas DNA-PKcs stimulates intermolecular DNA joining even in the presence of Ku. Further studies will provide insights into the multiprotein complexes involving DNA ligase IV-XRCC4, Ku, and DNA-PKcs that are assembled on DNA ends. Three genes encoding DNA ligases, LIG1,LIG3, and LIG4, have been identified in the mammalian genome (1Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The products of these genes appear to be responsible for the DNA-joining events that complete DNA replication, genetic recombination, and DNA repair in mammalian cells. In the lower eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA ligases encoded by the CDC9 and DNL4 genes are functional homologs of the LIG1 and LIG4 genes. However, this organism apparently lacks a LIG3 gene homolog (2Barnes D.E. Johnston L.H. Kodama K. Tomkinson A.E. Lasko D.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6679-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Schar P. Herrman G. Daly G. Lindahl T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1912-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4Teo S.-H.

Mammalian DNA ligases consist of a conserved catalytic domain flanked by unrelated sequences (1Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that protein-protein interactions mediated by the unique regions flanking the catalytic domain determine the cellular functions of these enzymes. In support of this hypothesis, recent studies have identified specific protein partners for each of the LIG gene products. The non-catalytic N-terminal domain of DNA ligase I interacts with both proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DNA polymerase β, implicating this species of DNA ligase in DNA replication and excision repair pathways (6Dimitriadis E.K.

In contrast, the non-catalytic C-terminal extensions of DNA ligases IIIα and IV contain BRCT motifs (8Wei Y.-F. Robins P. Carter K. Caldecott K. Pappin D.J.C., Yu, G.-L. Wang R.-P. Shell B.K.

https://openalex.org/W1990852009,"Alterations in the concentration of malonyl-CoA, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, have been linked to the regulation of fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. During contraction decreases in muscle malonyl-CoA concentration have been related to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme in malonyl-CoA formation. We report here that the activity of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) is increased in contracting muscle. Using either immunopurified enzyme or enzyme partially purified by (NH(4))(2)SO(4) precipitation, 2-3-fold increases in the V(max) of MCD and a 40% decrease in its K(m) for malonyl-CoA (190 versus 119 micrometer) were observed in rat gastrocnemius muscle after 5 min of contraction, induced by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. The increase in MCD activity was markedly diminished when immunopurified enzyme was treated with protein phosphatase 2A or when phosphatase inhibitors were omitted from the homogenizing solution and assay mixture. Incubation of extensor digitorum longus muscle for 1 h with 2 mm 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside, a cell-permeable activator of AMPK, increased MCD activity 2-fold. Here, too, addition of protein phosphatase 2A to the immunopellets reversed the increase of MCD activity. The results strongly suggest that activation of AMPK during muscle contraction leads to phosphorylation of MCD and an increase in its activity. They also suggest a dual control of malonyl-CoA concentration by ACC and MCD, via AMPK, during exercise."
https://openalex.org/W1964335421,"We recently identified agamma-interferon-induciblelysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), constitutively expressed in antigen-presenting cells, that catalyzes disulfide bond reduction both in vitro andin vivo and is optimally active at acidic pH.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 4054-4059PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence that in the endocytic pathway reducing activity was present primarily in lysosomes while absent from early recycling endosomes. They proposed that disulfide bond reduction in lysosomes was largely catalyzed by a high concentration of cysteine, which is transported into the lumen by amino acid transporters. In a recent report, we suggested that along with cysteine, a γ-interferon-induciblelysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), originally described as IP30 (registered as IFI30, Human Gene Nomenclature Data Base), may contribute to the reducing activity of MIICs (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). GILT is synthesized as a 35-kDa soluble glycoprotein (6Luster A.D.

The reduction of disulfide bonds by the mature form of GILT in vitro proved to be optimal at acidic pH (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5797-5806PubMed Google Scholar). Although the significance of this association has not been determined, the observation raised the question of whether precursor GILT is functionally distinct from its mature form. Another distinction between the two forms is that, following secretion, precursor GILT forms disulfide-linked dimers (6Luster A.D. Weinshankk R.L. Feiman R. Ravetch J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12036-12043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the thiol reductase properties of the precursor and its processing to mature GILT and also investigate its mechanism of action. The human B lymphoblastoid line (B-LCL), Pala (13Denzin L.K. Robbins N.F. Carboy-Newcomb C. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), has been described previously. COS-7 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. The rabbit antisera R.GILT (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), R.IP30N (12Arunachalam B.

The following proteases and inhibitors were purchased from Sigma: cathepsin B; chloroquine, 2S,3S-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (E64d), iodoacetamide (IAA), leupeptin, pepstatin A. Cathepsins D and L andN-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-l-phenyl-alanyl-l-tyrosinal (Z-FY-CHO) were purchased from Calbiochem. Cathepsin S was generously provided by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals (Ridgefield, CT), and morpholinurea-leucine-homophenylalanine-vinylsulfone phenyl (LHVS) was generously provided by Dr. Hidde Ploegh, Harvard Medical School.N-Glycosidase F was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Human GILT was affinity-purified from B-LCLs using the monoclonal antibody MAP.IP30 coupled to Bio-Gel A15m beads as described previously (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The generation of the cysteine to serine mutant GILT derivatives (C46S, C49S, C46S/C49S) and the cloning of wild-type and mutant GILT cDNAs into the expression vector pcDNA 3.1 puro(−) was described previously (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were seeded overnight in T75 flasks, grown to 80% confluence, and transfected with 20 μg of GILT or mutant GILT cDNAs using CellFECTIN (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 72 h the cells were harvested and lysed on ice in 1% Triton X-100 in 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris (TS), pH 6.9, while the supernatants were concentrated 15-fold using Ultrafree-15 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Mature GILT and precursor GILT were immunoprecipitated, from the cell extracts and concentrated supernatants respectively, with MAP.IP30-Bio-Gel A15m beads and eluted with 120 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm acetate, pH 3.5. The pH was adjusted accordingly with 1m Tris. The assay was described previously (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Briefly, affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was iodinated by the chloramine-T method (16Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Roche P.A. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1849-1856PubMed Google Scholar), denatured by boiling in 0.2% SDS, and diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15m NaCl. MAP.IP30 eluates were preactivated with 25 μm dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 10 min, and SDS-denatured F(ab′)2 (10,000 cpm) was added. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C in a final volume of 110 μl and terminated after 1 h by the addition of IAA to 5 mm. Samples were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and individual bands quantitated using a Bio-Rad GS-250 Molecular Imager.l-Cysteine, cysteinyl glycine, and reduced glutathione (GSH) were also used instead of DTT to preactivate the eluates in certain experiments. Mature forms of wild-type and mutant GILT were immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cells, as described above. Following the MAP.IP30-A15m immunoprecipitation and subsequent washes, the bound GILT was incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100, in TS, pH 6.9, containing 0.5 mm DTT for 15 min on ice to remove any disulfide-bound species. The beads were washed four times in the same buffer without DTT. GILT was eluted with 120 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm acetate, pH 3.5, and the pH was adjusted to 4.5 with 1m Tris. 30 μl of the eluates were added to SDS-denatured F(ab′)2 (200,000 cpm) in a final volume of 110 μl and incubated at 37 °C and pH 4.5 for 1 h. The pH was adjusted to 7.0, and IAA was added to 5 mm. The samples were immunoprecipitated with MAP.IP30 or with the monoclonal antibody IG12, which is specific for human transferrin receptor, as a negative control. To reduce nonspecific binding, MAP.IP30-A15m and IG12-A15m beads were washed first with 5% bovine calf serum, which was pretreated with 5 mm IAA. Immunoprecipitations were performed in 1% Triton X-100, in TS, pH 6.9, containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide to further reduce background binding. Samples were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Precursor GILT, immunoisolated from GILT-expressing COS-7 cells, was incubated with various cathepsins in the absence or presence of inhibitors for 2 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of either IAA to 5 mmfor the cysteine proteases or 10 μg/ml pepstatin A for cathepsin D. The same digestion buffer, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, was used for all reactions. Concentrations of cathepsins used were as follows: 1 unit/ml cathepsin B, 1 unit/ml cathepsin D, 0.8 μm cathepsin L, and 0.8 μm cathepsin S. The respective inhibitors used were 5 mm IAA, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μmZ-FY-CHO, and 0.5 μm LHVS. Immunoisolated precursor GILT was deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F using the buffer recommended by the manufacturers. Digestions were performed for 16 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Pala cells (3 × 106/sample) were incubated with methionine-free, cysteine-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C, labeled for 30 min with 0.25 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and chased in the presence of 15-fold excess methionine/cysteine for up to 4 h. The inhibitors used, chloroquine (30 μm), leupeptin (1 mm), E64d (30 μm), and pepstatin A (30 μm), were present in the preincubation, label, and chase. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, TS, pH 6.9, precleared with normal rabbit serum and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immunoprecipitations performed with the anti-HLA-DRα mAb DA6.147 or with MAP.IP30 and protein G-Sepharose. Samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE (12%) followed by autoradiography. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (18Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE (12% w/v acrylamide) and electrophoretically transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.03% Tween 20, 5% dehydrated milk, and 5% bovine calf serum (Blotto), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and probed with R.GILT (1:1000), R.IP30N (1:1000 or 1 μg/ml), and R.IP30C (1:500) in Blotto. Bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (F(ab′)2 fragment-specific) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). We showed previously that in a B-LCL such as Pala, a fraction of precursor GILT is secreted, while the majority remains intracellular and is proteolytically processed (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To isolate precursor GILT, GILT was overexpressed in COS-7 cells and the precursor form immunoisolated from concentrated supernatants. Eluates from both the supernatant and cell extracts of COS-7 cells expressing wild-type GILT or the C46S/C49S double mutant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting with the rabbit antisera R.GILT, R.IP30N, and R.IP30C (Fig.1 A). R.GILT recognizes both precursor and mature GILT, whereas R.IP30N and R.IP30C recognize only the N- and C-terminal propeptides, respectively. As expected, mature GILT was only detected with R.GILT, while precursor GILT was detected by all three antisera. However, multiple species of both wild-type and mutant precursor GILT were revealed. GILT has three potentialN-glycosylation sites at residues 37, 69, and 82 (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), suggesting that the multiple bands revealed in the immunoblots were likely to result from differences in glycosylation. To test this, the eluates were treated with N-glycosidase F, which removesN-linked glycans. Immunoblotting with R.GILT showed that deglycosylation converted all the precursor GILT to a single species (Fig. 1 B). The data suggested that protein overexpression in COS-7 results in incomplete glycosylation of a fraction of secreted precursor GILT, perhaps by overwhelming the glycosylation machinery. Luster et al. (6Luster A.D. Weinshankk R.L. Feiman R. Ravetch J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12036-12043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously showed that following secretion, precursor GILT forms disulfide-linked dimers. To confirm this, and to determine whether dimerization involved the active-site cysteines, eluates containing precursor wild-type and C46S/C49S GILT were separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with R.GILT (Fig. 1 C). For both wild-type and mutant, the majority of the GILT detected was dimeric, indicating that neither Cys-46 nor Cys-49 are required for dimerization. To test for thiol reductase activity we employed the assay previously described which uses 125I-F(ab′)2 as a substrate (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Eluates from MAP.IP30 beads were activated with 25 μm DTT. Wild-type and mutant forms of precursor and mature GILT were eluted in a total of 120 μl. Different volumes of the eluates (10, 20, and 40 μl) were incubated with denatured125I-F(ab′)2 at 37 °C for 1 h at pH 4.5. Reduction of F(ab′)2 into Fab′ and H′ and L chains was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography, quantitating by image analysis. Fig. 2,A and C, show that even 10 μl of wild-type precursor GILT reduced F(ab′)2 approximately 50%, whereas C46S/C49S precursor GILT was inactive at all concentrations (Fig. 2,B and C). The activity paralleled that of mature GILT. To determine whether precursor GILT has the same acidic pH optimum as the mature form, we assayed for activity in the pH range of 4.0–7.0. By N-glycosidase F digestion and Western blotting we confirmed that, although varying in glycosylation, only precursor GILT was immunoisolated from the supernatants of GILT-expressing COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 A). Eluates containing mature GILT were also analyzed by immunoblotting to confirm that similar amounts were assayed at the various pH values (Fig.3 A). From preliminary titrations performed at pH 4.5 we determined the volumes of precursor and mature GILT eluates that exhibited similar thiol reductase activity (data not shown) and used this volume for assaying activity at the different pH values. Fig.3 B shows that, like mature GILT, precursor GILT reduced F(ab′)2 with an acidic pH optimum. Quantitation of reduction is shown is Fig. 3 C. The slight apparent difference in pH optimum is within experimental error and is not reproducible. From immunofluorescence and electron microscopy data described earlier, it appears that precursor GILT first enters the endocytic pathway in early endosomes and is processed to the mature form in multivesicular late endosomes (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To determine whether processing is mediated by specific enzymes, we examined purified lysosomal cathepsins for their ability to cleave precursor GILT in vitro. Eluates were incubated with the various cathepsins either with or without inhibitors. The alkylating reagent, iodoacetamide, was used to inhibit cathepsin B activity. Pepstatin A inhibits aspartyl proteases, including cathepsin D, and Z-FY-CHO and LHVS inhibit cathepsin L and cathepsin S, respectively (19Woo J.T. Yamaguchi K. Hayama T. Kobori T. Sigeizumi S. Sugimoto K. Kondo K. Tsuji T. Ohba Y. Tagami K. Sumitani K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Palmer J.T. Rasnick D. Klaus J.L. Bromme D. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). To simplify the immunoblotting pattern the samples were deglycosylated prior to SDS-PAGE. Probing with antisera R.GILT, R.IP30N, and R.IP30C revealed that cathepsin B only cleaved the C-terminal propeptide, while cathepsin D only cleaved the N-terminal propeptide (Fig. 4 A–C). Cathepsin L cleaved both propeptides well, and cathepsin S cleaved the N-terminal propeptide completely and the C-terminal propeptide partially (Fig. 4, A–C). Also, addition of the specified inhibitors blocked proteolysis by each of the cathepsins (Fig. 4,A–C). It was previously shown that 5 nm LHVS specifically inhibited cathepsin S in vivo (21Riese R.J. Wolf P.R. Bromme D. Natkin L.R. Villandangos J.A. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, 0.8 μm recombinant cathepsin S was used in the in vitro digestion. Titrating LHVS in the range of 5 nmto 2 μm, we determined that 0.5 μm LHVS was necessary to block proteolysis by recombinant cathepsin S, used at 0.8 μm in vitro. The ability of LHVS to completely inhibit cathepsin S in less than a 1:1 molar ratio is presumably because a fraction of the cathepsin S is proteolytically inactive. Pala cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and chased with 15-fold excess cold methionine/cysteine for up to 4 h in the presence of chloroquine (30 μm), or a mixture of leupeptin (1 mm), E64d (30 μm), and pepstatin A (30 μm). The cells were detergent-extracted, GILT immunoprecipitated with MAP.IP30, and the samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. By increasing lysosomal pH, chloroquine inhibits all acid-optimal proteases. Consequently, chloroquine prevented GILT maturation (Fig.4 D). However, addition of two cysteinyl protease inhibitors, leupeptin and E64d, and an aspartyl protease inhibitor, pepstatin A, failed to arrest maturation (Fig. 4 D). Nor did any of these inhibitors affect GILT maturation when used individually (data not shown). This suggests that other proteases besides the cysteine proteases inhibited by leupeptin and E64d and aspartyl proteases inhibited by pepstatin A can cleave precursor GILT. Overall, the data argue that multiple lysosomal proteases contribute to GILT maturation. Physiological reductants, which have been proposed to contribute to the reducing activity in lysosomes, include cysteine and cysteinyl glycine. Pisoni et al. (22Pisoni R. Acker T.L. Lisowski K.M. Lemons R.M. Thoene J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that cysteine is efficiently delivered to the lysosomes by a cysteine-specific transport system. The role of cysteinyl glycine, however, is more ambiguous. Cysteinyl glycine is a by-product of the extracellular cleavage of glutathione by the ectoenzyme, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (23Mego J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 841: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this dipeptide is then transported across the plasma membrane and into lysosomes. Although the evidence that cysteinyl glycine is a physiological lysosomal reductant is circumstantial, its potential role cannot be excluded. The in vitro thiol reductase assay with iodinated F(ab′)2 was performed with purified GILT (1 μg) at pH 4.5 as described above, substituting 25 μm DTT withl-cysteine and cysteinyl glycine at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm (Fig. 5). Fig.5 A shows reduction of F(ab′)2 by the two reductants alone or with GILT. Inclusion of l-cysteine or cysteinyl glycine at 1 mm with GILT resulted in a significant increase in reduction of F(ab′)2 relative to reduction driven by the reductants alone. The concentration of cysteine or cysteinyl glycine required to activate GILT was 1 mm, 40-fold greater than for DTT (25 μm). The same concentration of both reductants was also able to activate precursor GILT immunoisolated from COS-7 cell supernatants (Fig. 5 C). Estimates of the cysteine concentration in endosomes and lysosomes range from several hundred μm to several tens mm (24Krepela E. Prochazaka J. Karova B. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that physiological cysteine concentrations can serve to mediate reduction by GILT. We are unaware of any quantitation of the level of cysteinyl glycine in lysosomes. In addition to l-cysteine and cysteinyl glycine, we also examined glutathione for its ability to activate GILT in vitro. Inclusion of 1 mm glutathione in the assay with either form of GILT did not increase reduction of F(ab′)2relative to reduction by glutathione alone (data not shown). The reaction mechanism of the active-site motif (CXXC) in thioredoxin and protein disulfide isomerase has been well characterized (reviewed in Refs. 11Chivers P.T. Laboissiere C.A. Raines R.T. Guzman N.A. Prolyl Hydroxylase, Protein Disulfide Isomerase, and Other Structurally Related Proteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 487-505Google Scholar and 25Mustachich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the reaction, the N-terminal cysteine is believed to initiate nucleophilic attack on a disulfide bond, generating an enzyme-substrate mixed disulfide intermediate. Subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the second active-site cysteine releases the intermediate, generating an oxidized enzyme and a reduced substrate. By mutating the second cysteine to a structural analogue such as serine or alanine, the mixed disulfide enzyme-substrate complex can be stabilized and trapped, both in vitro and in vivo (26Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows a schematic of the predicted reaction mechanism for wild-type and C49S GILT, and given that C49S GILT is able to trap substrates, predicted intermediates formed with F(ab′)2 derivatives. For in vitro trapping experiments with F(ab′)2, mature wild-type or mutant (C46S, C49S, and C46S/C49S) GILT was immunoisolated from transfected COS-7 cells and incubated on ice in 0.1% TX-100, in TS containing 0.5 mm DTT, while still bound to MAP.IP30-A15m beads. The beads were then washed, and the various GILT species eluted at pH 3.5. The eluates were incubated for 1 h with 200,000 cpm of denatured125I-F(ab′)2 at pH 4.5, 37 °C, without any added reducing agents. After adding IAA to 5 mm, the samples were either precipitated with MAP.IP30-A15m beads or, for a negative control, with IG12-A15m beads. IG12 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the human transferrin receptor. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and analyzed by autoradiography (Fig. 7, left panel). In addition, 2 μl of each eluate were separated on the same gel and immunoblotted with R.GILT (Fig. 7, right panel) to confirm that similar quantities of mature GILT and GILT mutants were isolated. Covalently linked trapped species were only detected with the C49S GILT mutant. The estimated molecular masses of these species are 55, 80, and 105 kDa. Based on the predicted intermediates (Fig. 6 C), the 55-kDa band is likely to correspond to heavy chain fragment (H′)-GILT and light chain (L)-GILT, the 80-kDa band to F(ab′)-GILT, and the 105-kDa band to F(ab′)-H′-GILT. No bound species were observed using the IG12-A15m beads (data not shown). Following synthesis, lysosomal enzymes undergo posttranslational glycosylation, which occurs in the ER and Golgi, and limited proteolysis. The nature and site of intracellular proteolysis is variable, even within a family of lysosomal enzymes. For example, cleavage can be internal, or N- and C-terminal, and can occur in the lysosomes themselves or prior to delivery to lysosomes, in compartments such as the ER and post-Golgi organelles. Proteolysis can involve multiple steps and may be essential for enzyme activation. Lysosomal proteases such as cathepsins B, D, and L are synthesized as inactive zymogens (reviewed in Ref. 28McGrath M.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 181-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Following transport to lysosomes, the acidic pH induces autocatalytic proteolysis, generating the mature, active cathepsins. Examples where lysosomal proteolysis does not appear to regulate enzymatic activity include β-galactosidase and aspartylglucosaminidase. β-Galactosidase is synthesized as a 86-kDa precursor and is processed to a 64-kDa mature form by removal of a 20-kDa C-terminal propeptide (29Yamamoto Y. Hake C.A. Martin B.M. Kretz K.A. Ahern-Rindell A.J. Naylor S.L. Mudd M. O'Brien J.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The precursor form associates in the lysosome in a multienzyme complex, which also includes α-neuraminidase and cathepsin A (30D'Azzo A. Hoogeveen A. Reuser A.J. Robinson D. Galjaard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4535-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 31Hoogeveen A.T. Verheijen F.W. Galjaard H. J. Biol.

Commun. 1990; 168: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). From expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it was shown that the secreted precursor β-galactosidase was functionally identical to the mature form, demonstrating that the C-terminal propeptide is not enzymatically inhibitory (34Zhang S. McCarter J.D. Okamura-Oho Y. Yaghi F. Hinek A. Withers S.G. Callahan J.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Aspartylglucosaminidase is also synthesized as a precursor and becomes enzymatically active in the ER when the 42-kDa form is internally cleaved into two subunits, a 27-kDa pro-α chain and a 17-kDa chain (35Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O.-K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After delivery to the lysosome, the pro-α chain is further trimmed at the C terminus to the mature 24-kDa form with no effect on the enzymatic activity. Our previous study (5Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) only examined the thiol reductase activity of mature GILT. Here we have shown that the precursor form of GILT can also reduce disulfide bonds, indicating that neither the N- or C-terminal propeptides inhibit the reductase activity. In vitro cleavage of either or both the N- and C-terminal propeptides of precursor GILT can be mediated by the lysosomal proteases, cathepsins B, D, L, and S (Fig. 4). Although GILT maturation was arrested by chloroquine in vivo, a mixture of the cysteinyl protease inhibitors, E64d and leupeptin, and the aspartyl protease inhibitor, pepstatin A, failed to prevent maturation (Fig.4 D). These findings suggest that GILT processing is not mediated by any specific enzyme and argue that the N- and C-terminal prosequences are readily accessible to multiple lysosomal proteases. Precursor GILT was purified as a secreted product from overexpressing COS-7 cells. Fig. 1 shows that the isolated material contains four species of different apparent molecular weights.N-Glycosidase F treatment converted the upper three bands to the apparent M r of the lower band (Fig.1 B). This indicates that the lower, fainter band corresponds to unglycosylated precursor, and the upper three correspond to precursor GILT containing three, two, and one N-linked glycans, respectively. Notably, mature GILT isolated from detergent extracts of the same cells does not show evidence of variable glycosylation. This may be because at least one N-linked glycan must be converted to the mannose-6-phosphate-bearing form for proper targeting to the endocytic pathway. A second reason, not necessarily exclusive of the first, is that the absence of one or moreN-linked glycans renders GILT sensitive to proteolysis in the lysosome or MIIC. We also showed that cysteine and cysteinyl glycine were able to activate precursor and mature GILT (Fig. 5 C). Although the role of cysteinyl glycine as a physiological reductant is unclear, cysteine has clearly been implicated as a pertinent reductant. Pisoniet al. (22Pisoni R. Acker T.L. Lisowski K.M. Lemons R.M. Thoene J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that lysosomes in murine macrophages transported cysteine effectively from the cytosol into the lumen using a specific transport system. Gainey et al. (36Gainey D. Short S. McCoy K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) later reported that, although in a macrophage hybridoma cell line cysteine was only transported into lysosomes, in a murine B cell line cysteine was effectively transported into endosomes as well as lysosomes. They argued that the site of disulfide reduction of endocytosed proteins is not necessarily confined to lysosomes and is variable among the different types of antigen-presenting cells. The finding that precursor GILT exhibits enzymatic activity raises the possibility that it may be involved in disulfide bond reduction early in the endocytic pathway. As described previously, precursor GILT colocalizes with intact invariant chain, presumably associated with MHC class II αβ dimers, largely in early endosomes/early MIICs. The pH of these organelles is believed to be 5.5–6.0. We have shown that precursor GILT, as well as mature GILT, can still effectively reduce disulfide bonds in this pH range (Fig. 3). The presence of cysteine in compartments preceding lysosomes (36Gainey D. Short S. McCoy K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggests that precursor GILT may be sufficiently active in early endosomes/early MIICs to initiate the reduction of internalized protein antigens prior to proteolysis. This may be important in preserving class II binding epitopes by allowing class II molecules to bind to unfolded proteins or fragments of proteins, prior to their complete degradation. Interestingly, we showed previously that precursor GILT itself binds in vivo to HLA-DRw52 molecules (12Arunachalam B. Pan M. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5797-5806PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction was enhanced by chloroquine treatment, suggesting that invariant chain proteolysis and release of peptide-binding MHC class II αβ dimers may occur more readily in the endocytic pathway than proteolysis of other proteins. This again is consistent with unfolded proteins becoming available for MHC class II binding prior to significant proteolysis. Recently, Gingras et al. (37Gingras R. Richard C. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11742-11750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that GILT (referred to as IP30 in the report) could be purified from human placenta by affinity chromatography using an affinity column consisting of phenyl-leucine coupled to epoxy-activated agarose. Other proteins that were copurified included the carboxypeptidases cathepsin A and plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase and the endoprotease cathepsin D. The isolation of GILT could have resulted from either direct binding to the dipeptide Phe-Leu or binding to cathepsin A, cathepsin D, or plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase. Our own preliminary data suggest that GILT can bind Phe-Leu-agarose directly (data not shown). Because the other proteins copurified by Gingras et al. (37Gingras R. Richard C. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11742-11750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were proteases, we tested whether GILT could perhaps also be a peptidase or a protease using a variety of peptide and protein substrates. However, we were unable to demonstrate that GILT possessed either activity (data not shown). Whether the affinity of GILT for the hydrophobic dipeptide Phe-Leu reflects an additional function is unknown, but an intriguing possibility is that it represents a binding site for hydrophobic regions of proteins and that GILT may play a role in protein unfolding in addition to its thiol reductase activity. The demonstration that both the precursor and mature forms of GILT are enzymatically active begs the question of why GILT is synthesized as a precursor at all. The N- and C-terminal propeptides may simply be required for proper folding in the ER, or they may serve a different function. There are two cysteine residues in the C-terminal propeptide, one of which may play a role in dimerization of precursor GILT, although the role of dimerization is itself unclear. Conceivably these cysteine residues could regulate the activity of the enzyme in some way that is not readily apparent in the in vitro assay we have employed. The functions of the propeptides can be approached by mutagenesis experiments. The data presented in Fig. 7 show that mutagenesis of the second cysteine in the active site generates a “trapping” phenotype like that of analogous mutants of other members of the thioredoxin family. Thus, the mechanism of action of GILT is likely to be similar. Redox reactions involving cysteine residues require de-protonation of a thiol group, in the active site of the enzyme in the case of reduction, as indicated schematically in Fig. 6. The acidic pH optimum of GILT argues that the region surrounding the active site must have evolved to facilitate de-protonation of Cys-46 for the initiation of the nucleophilic attack on the target disulfide bond. Precisely how this occurs may become evident when the three dimensional structure of GILT is uncovered. We thank Drs. Tobias Dick, Maja Maric, Alexey V. Pshezhetsky, and David Karp for suggestions and stimulating discussions; Drs.

Carbonyl groups generated by hydrogen peroxide or menadione on proteins of aerobically respiring cells were detected by Western blotting, purified, and identified. Mitochondrial proteins such as E2 subunits of both pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, aconitase, heat-shock protein 60, and the cytosolic fatty acid synthase (α subunit) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were the major targets. In addition we also report the in vivomodification of lipoamide present in the above-mentioned E2 subunits under the stressing conditions tested and that this also occurs with the homologous enzymes present in Escherichia coli cells that were used for comparative analysis. Under fermentative conditions, the main protein targets in S. cerevisiae cells treated with hydrogen peroxide or menadione were pyruvate decarboxylase, enolase, fatty acid synthase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Under the stress conditions tested, fermenting cells exhibit a lower viability than aerobically respiring cells and, consistently, increased peroxide generation as well as higher content of protein carbonyls and lipid peroxides. Our results strongly suggest that the oxidative stress in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells shares common features."

Engelfriet C.P. Contreras M. Blood Transfusion in Clinical Medicine. Blackwell Science, Oxford, England1997Google Scholar). They are defined by two erythroid-specific transmembrane (TM) proteins, the Rh polypeptides and the Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG), which form a multisubunit complex and display exodomains as D or CcEe antigens (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Rh polypeptides are highly polymorphic and are distinguished from RhAG by two biochemical features, i.e. palmitoylation but no glycosylation. In contrast, RhAG is largely invariant at the population level and is thought to modulate the assembly of the Rh complex and its surface expression. Human Rh polypeptides and RhAG are encoded byRHCED and RHAG loci that reside on chromosomes 1 and 6, respectively (3Cherif-Zahar B. Mattei M.-G. Le Van Kim C. Bailly P. Cartron J.-P. Colin Y. Hum.

J. 1992; 287: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Despite this difference, theseRH genes have originated from a common ancestor during evolution in that they are homologous in coding sequence and are grossly similar in exon/intron organization (5Huang C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2207-2213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Matassi G. Chérif-Zahar B. Raynal V. Rouger P. Cartron J.-P. Genomics. 1998; 47: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Although their exact functions remain to be identified, Rh proteins (and their complex) are necessary for the maintenance of RBC morphology and plasma membrane integrity. The Rh deficiency syndrome, a rare inherited form of hemolytic anemia, is caused by mutations at theRHAG or RHCED locus (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this disorder, RBCs deficient in all Rh antigens exhibit spherostomatocytosis and multiple membrane abnormalities (7Agre P. Cartron J.-P. Blood. 1991; 78: 551-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that Rh proteins have some functional roles in membrane physiological processes. At the level of secondary structure, RhAG and RhCE/D bear a 12-TM topology resembling many transporters (8Henderson P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and thus are likely to possess a transporter activity across the lipid bilayer. Ammonium or amino group-containing compounds have been suggested as candidate ligands for erythroid Rh proteins, owing to their connective sequence similarity with the NH4+ transporters from bacteria, yeast, and plants (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Marini A.M. Urrestarazu A. Beauwens R. Andre B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 460-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).The Rh family of genes and proteins is rooted deeply in evolution, and the erythroid homologues of human RHAG and RHCEDgenes are coexpressed in RBC of all mammalian species. The closestRHAG and RHCED relatives are those from nonhuman primates, as they share not only high sequence identity but also some antigen reactivity (10Blancher A. Socha W.W. Blancher A. Klein J. Socha W.W. Molecular Biology and Evolution of Blood Group and MHC Antigens in Primates. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 147-218Crossref Google Scholar, 11Huang, C.-H., Liu, Z., Apoil, P.-A., and Blancher, A. (2000) J. Mol. Evol., in pressGoogle Scholar). We previously showed that the mouse erythroid Rhag and Rhced are identical to their human counterparts in the arrangement of exon/intron junctions, in the conservation of chromosome synteny, and in the pattern of coexpression (12Liu Z. Huang C.-H. Biochem. Genet. 1999; 37: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rh homologues have been identified in primitive organisms, e.g. the unicellular slime moldDictyostelium discoideum (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), marine sponge Geodia cydonium (13Seack J. Pancer Z. Muller I.M. Muller W.E. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and earthworm Caenorhabditis elegans(14Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, 15Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G.J. Chen Y. Blood. 1998; 92: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, these primitive Rh forms are more similar to RhAG than they are to RhCE/D, providing some important insights into the origin of erythroid members from nonerythroid ancestors. However, it is not known whether these Rh homologues in primitive organisms had branched out, giving rise to new family members expressed in nonerythroid tissues or organs of vertebrate species.To understand the structure-function relationships of Rh proteins, we have been using a homology approach to clone and identify new Rh genes from lower organisms and from nonerythroid tissues. We describe here the characterization of Rh type C glycoproteins, human RhCG and mouse Rhcg, two orthologous members of the Rh protein family expressed in nonerythroid tissues. We show that RhCG and Rhcg share with their erythroid counterparts the conserved 12-TM topology and cognate signature sequences. However, as the first vertebrate members recognized in the nonerythroid Rh subfamily, RhCG and Rhcg are distinct in primary structure, genomic organization, chromosomal location, tissue-specific expression, and biochemical properties. The studies detailed herein pinpoint RhCG and Rhcg as novel polytopic membrane glycoproteins that may function as epithelial transporters maintaining normal homeostatic conditions in the kidney and testis.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have isolated several new Rh genes and performed detailed characterization of the human RHCG and mouse Rhcg genes encoding a novel pair of polytopic plasma membrane glycoproteins. We showed that the RhCG and Rhcg cDNAs are highly conserved with regard to their nucleotide and derived protein sequences and membrane topologic organization. These results firmly establish the genuine orthologous relationship between the two homologues, suggesting that they possess the same functional role(s) in both human and mouse nonerythroid tissues. Clustal analyses of known Rh homologues define RhCG and Rhcg as the first new members of the nonerythroid Rh subfamily in vertebrate species, including all mammals. The detailed studies concerning the genetic and biochemical aspects of RhCG/Rhcg revealed common features as well as distinct differences between the erythroid and nonerythroid Rh homologues. Collectively these results provide novel insights into the molecular evolution, structural conservation, tissue-specific expression, and possible biological function of the Rh family of genes and proteins.The many homologous sequences assembled suggests the existence of a Rh superfamily, which to date consists of five and four discrete gene members in humans and mice, respectively. Based on their genomic synteny, sequence identity, and tissue specificity, the human and mouse homologues can be divided into four orthologous groups, i.e.two erythroid gene pairs (RHAG/Rhag andRHCED/Rhced) and two nonerythroid gene pairs (RHCG/Rhcg and RHBG/Rhbg). Notably, all theRH loci harbor single copy genes, except for humanRHCED (37Carritt B. Kemp T.J. Poulter M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and all have a different map location, although each orthologous group shows comparable chromosomal synteny. By contrast, there is only one Rh gene in the unicellular organism slime mold (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), two tightly linked copies in C. elegans (15Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G.J. Chen Y. Blood. 1998; 92: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and three discrete members in the zebrafish.2 These observations suggest that both the erythroid and nonerythroid branches came into existence before mammalian radiation and that their multiplicity occurred mainly via intergenic translocation events. This pattern of RH duplication is likely to have produced functional novelty in a different temporal and spatial context within the organism, given changes in both coding sequence and regulatory elements of the gene (5Huang C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2207-2213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Matassi G. Chérif-Zahar B. Raynal V. Rouger P. Cartron J.-P.

Kajii E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Compared with erythroid homologues, both primitive and nonerythroid members, including RhCG and Rhcg, are structurally much closer to RhAG/Rhag than they are to RhCED/Rhced. By excluding the more distant RhCED/Rhced group, a membrane fold has been identified, which is characterized by shared signatures conserved among human/mouse RhCG/Rhcg, RhBG/Rhbg, and RhAG/Rhag pairs. This relationship conforms to the approximate equidistance between the erythroid and nonerythroid branches and extends the observation that the RHCED series originated from an Rhag ancestor gene but evolved at a much increased rate (11Huang, C.-H., Liu, Z., Apoil, P.-A., and Blancher, A. (2000) J. Mol. Evol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 38Kitano T. Sumiyama K. Shiroishi T. Saitou N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The slower divergence of RHAG and the faster evolution of RHCED imply an adapted functional specification that pertains to Rh complex assembly in the RBC membrane through heteromeric interactions. These interactions are likely mediated by both N- and C-terminal domains and involve hydrophobic contacts between RhAG and RhCED (39Ridgwell K. Eyers S.A. Mawby W.J. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6410-6416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Huang C.-H. Cheng G.-J. Liu Z. Chen Y. Reid M.E. Halverson G. Okubo Y. Am. J.

Genet. 1996; 12: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Without RhAG expression, as observed in the regulator type of Rhnull disease (40Huang C.-H. Cheng G.-J. Liu Z. Chen Y. Reid M.E. Halverson G. Okubo Y. Am. J. Hematol. 1999; 62: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 41Cherif-Zahar B. Raynal V. Gane P. Mattei M.-G. Bailly P. Gibbs B. Colin Y. Cartron J.-P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the RhCE/D proteins and their associated antigens are not dispositioned at the cell surface. In sharp contrast, such heteromeric interaction is not a prerequisite for surface expression of RhCG, as RhCG could by itself reach the plasma membrane, whether transfected into homologous or heterologous cells. Most likely, nonerythroid Rh homologues possess intrinsic topogenic signal sequences that can direct their own intracellular transport and plasma membrane destination. Further studies are required to determine whether RhCG/Rhcg is on apical or basal membrane in the cells.Besides their capability of being expressed in heterologous cells, RhCG and Rhcg differ from erythroid members in the following features. 1) They each have a larger exoloop 6 and much longer cytoplasmic C-terminal sequence that is rich in Pro and Ser residues. This novel C-terminal domain may be involved in functional modulation of RhCG or Rhcg through interactions with some yet-to-be recognized intracellular proteins. 2) RHCG/Rhcg is unique, having a CpG island-rich promoter and an extra 3′-UTR exon, suggesting a different mode in controlling tissue-specific expression. 3) The humanRHCG gene is mapped at 15q25 and close to the type I tyrosinemia disease locus (42McKusick V.A. The Human Genome Database Project. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD1999Google Scholar), although its phenotypic relationship with the latter is unknown. 4) The onset of Rhcg expression occurs very late in development, contrary to the early coexpression ofRhag and Rhced that parallels erythroid differentiation at embryonic stages (12Liu Z. Huang C.-H. Biochem. Genet. 1999; 37: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 5) Compared with the erythroid restriction of Rhag/Rhced (12Liu Z. Huang C.-H. Biochem. Genet. 1999; 37: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), RHCG orRhcg is abundantly and broadly expressed in the kidney and in the testis. 6) Although residing in the plasma membrane, as erythroid Rh proteins, Rhcg is concentrated in the epithelial linings of the tubular structures, the kidney collecting tubules, and the testis seminiferous tubules. These features suggest new testable hypotheses as to the function of RhCG/Rhcg, possibly acting as a previously unrecognized transporter across the plasma membrane of epithelial cells.Rh proteins have long been thought to possess a transport activity due to their characteristic TM fold and associated morphological and physiological changes in Rhnull disease (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Agre P. Cartron J.-P. Blood. 1991; 78: 551-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, their ligand(s) has not been identified, and their functional dependence on the assembly of a heteromeric complex between RhAG and RhCED remains to be established. Prior studies suggested that Rh might function as an ATP-dependent phosphatidylserine transporter (phosphatidylserine flipase) of the RBC membrane (43Connor J. Schroit A.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 44Schroit A.J. Bloy C. Conner J. Cartron J.-P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10303-10306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, two lines of evidence disfavor this proposal: 1) Rh proteins lack the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Agre P. Cartron J.-P. Blood. 1991; 78: 551-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 2) Rhnull cells have a normal phosphatidylserine transport activity (45Smith R.E. Dalek D.L. Blood. 1990; 76: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, a relationship between erythroid Rh proteins and NH4+ transporters of the Mep/Amt family has been suggested based on marginal sequence identity (11.1–17.7%) (9Marini A.M. Urrestarazu A. Beauwens R. Andre B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 460-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). RhCG/Rhcg and other nonerythroid homologues lie in the same range of identity with these transporters. Although NH4+ transporters are found in all three domains of life (9Marini A.M. Urrestarazu A. Beauwens R. Andre B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 460-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), Rh family members occur only in Eucarya(2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In Eucarya, Mep/Amt members occur in yeast (46Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), plants (47Kaiser B.N. Finnegan P.M. Tyerman S.D. Whitehead L.F. Bergersen F.J. Day D.A. Udvardi M.K. Science. 1998; 281: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and nematodes (14Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar), but not other animals; in contrast, Rh homologues are present in animals (10Blancher A. Socha W.W. Blancher A. Klein J. Socha W.W. Molecular Biology and Evolution of Blood Group and MHC Antigens in Primates. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 147-218Crossref Google Scholar) and slime mold (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) but absent in yeast and plants, except algae.2 The sequence connection, along with the tissue specificity, raises the possibility that RhCG and Rhcg occur as potential NH4+transporters in kidney and testis. However, it should be noted that the homology between RhCG/Rhcg and Mep/Amt proteins is quite dispersed and only distantly related. This evolutionary distance could be large enough to endow RhCG/Rhcg with a pivotal structural difference in functional specification. Furthermore, evolution economy also argues against the coexistence of two Rh homologues and three Mep/Amt proteins as the same functional duplicates that all transport NH4+ in C. elegans (14Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Finally, the topology of RhCG/Rhcg resembles numerous 12-TM transporters lacking an ABC domain (8Henderson P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) but differs from that of Mep/Amt members, which generally contain 10 TM helical domains (46Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 47Kaiser B.N. Finnegan P.M. Tyerman S.D. Whitehead L.F. Bergersen F.J. Day D.A. Udvardi M.K.

Gocayne J.D. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). If the spatially conserved amino acids are to form a binding site for the amino group only, RhCG or Rhcg may serve to transport some novel amines rather than ammonium itself. The conserved structure and abundant expression suggest that RhCG and Rhcg play an essential role in maintaining normal homeostatic conditions in kidney and testis. In future work, it will thus be important to examine the above hypotheses using models amenable to biochemical and physiological manipulations. To this end, the transient and stable expression systems described here should serve as useful tools for the functional identification of both erythroid and nonerythroid Rh family proteins. The Rh antigens, originally identified in human red blood cells (RBCs),1 are potent immunogens and, when incompatible, cause hemolytic disease of the newborn and blood transfusion reaction (1Mollison P.L. Engelfriet C.P. Contreras M. Blood Transfusion in Clinical Medicine. Blackwell Science, Oxford, England1997Google Scholar). They are defined by two erythroid-specific transmembrane (TM) proteins, the Rh polypeptides and the Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG), which form a multisubunit complex and display exodomains as D or CcEe antigens (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Rh polypeptides are highly polymorphic and are distinguished from RhAG by two biochemical features, i.e. palmitoylation but no glycosylation. In contrast, RhAG is largely invariant at the population level and is thought to modulate the assembly of the Rh complex and its surface expression. Human Rh polypeptides and RhAG are encoded byRHCED and RHAG loci that reside on chromosomes 1 and 6, respectively (3Cherif-Zahar B. Mattei M.-G. Le Van Kim C. Bailly P. Cartron J.-P. Colin Y. Hum. Genet. 1991; 86: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 4Ridgwell K. Spurr N.K. Laguda B. MacGeoch C. Avent N.D. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Despite this difference, theseRH genes have originated from a common ancestor during evolution in that they are homologous in coding sequence and are grossly similar in exon/intron organization (5Huang C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2207-2213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Matassi G. Chérif-Zahar B. Raynal V. Rouger P. Cartron J.-P. Genomics. 1998; 47: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although their exact functions remain to be identified, Rh proteins (and their complex) are necessary for the maintenance of RBC morphology and plasma membrane integrity. The Rh deficiency syndrome, a rare inherited form of hemolytic anemia, is caused by mutations at theRHAG or RHCED locus (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this disorder, RBCs deficient in all Rh antigens exhibit spherostomatocytosis and multiple membrane abnormalities (7Agre P. Cartron J.-P. Blood. 1991; 78: 551-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that Rh proteins have some functional roles in membrane physiological processes. At the level of secondary structure, RhAG and RhCE/D bear a 12-TM topology resembling many transporters (8Henderson P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and thus are likely to possess a transporter activity across the lipid bilayer. Ammonium or amino group-containing compounds have been suggested as candidate ligands for erythroid Rh proteins, owing to their connective sequence similarity with the NH4+ transporters from bacteria, yeast, and plants (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Marini A.M. Urrestarazu A. Beauwens R. Andre B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 460-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The Rh family of genes and proteins is rooted deeply in evolution, and the erythroid homologues of human RHAG and RHCEDgenes are coexpressed in RBC of all mammalian species. The closestRHAG and RHCED relatives are those from nonhuman primates, as they share not only high sequence identity but also some antigen reactivity (10Blancher A. Socha W.W. Blancher A. Klein J. Socha W.W. Molecular Biology and Evolution of Blood Group and MHC Antigens in Primates. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 147-218Crossref Google Scholar, 11Huang, C.-H., Liu, Z., Apoil, P.-A., and Blancher, A. (2000) J. Mol. Evol., in pressGoogle Scholar). We previously showed that the mouse erythroid Rhag and Rhced are identical to their human counterparts in the arrangement of exon/intron junctions, in the conservation of chromosome synteny, and in the pattern of coexpression (12Liu Z. Huang C.-H. Biochem. Genet. 1999; 37: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rh homologues have been identified in primitive organisms, e.g. the unicellular slime moldDictyostelium discoideum (2Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 34: 150-165Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), marine sponge Geodia cydonium (13Seack J. Pancer Z. Muller I.M. Muller W.E. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and earthworm Caenorhabditis elegans(14Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, 15Huang C.-H. Liu Z. Cheng G.J. Chen Y. Blood. 1998; 92: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, these primitive Rh forms are more similar to RhAG than they are to RhCE/D, providing some important insights into the origin of erythroid members from nonerythroid ancestors. However, it is not known whether these Rh homologues in primitive organisms had branched out, giving rise to new family members expressed in nonerythroid tissues or organs of vertebrate species. To understand the structure-function relationships of Rh proteins, we have been using a homology approach to clone and identify new Rh genes from lower organisms and from nonerythroid tissues. We describe here the characterization of Rh type C glycoproteins, human RhCG and mouse Rhcg, two orthologous members of the Rh protein family expressed in nonerythroid tissues. We show that RhCG and Rhcg share with their erythroid counterparts the conserved 12-TM topology and cognate signature sequences. However, as the first vertebrate members recognized in the nonerythroid Rh subfamily, RhCG and Rhcg are distinct in primary structure, genomic organization, chromosomal location, tissue-specific expression, and biochemical properties. The studies detailed herein pinpoint RhCG and Rhcg as novel polytopic membrane glycoproteins that may function as epithelial transporters maintaining normal homeostatic conditions in the kidney and testis. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have isolated several new Rh genes and performed detailed characterization of the human RHCG and mouse Rhcg genes encoding a novel pair of polytopic plasma membrane glycoproteins. We showed that the RhCG and Rhcg cDNAs are highly conserved with regard to their nucleotide and derived protein sequences and membrane topologic organization. These results firmly establish the genuine orthologous relationship between the two homologues, suggesting that they possess the same functional role(s) in both human and mouse nonerythroid tissues.

VASP mutated (Ser/Thr to Ala) at all three of its established phosphorylation sites (vesicular stomatitis virus-tagged VASP-AAA mutant) was not phosphorylated by cGK I and was resistant to detaching from HUVEC focal adhesions in response to 8-pCPT-cGMP. Furthermore, activation of cGK I, but not of mutant cGK Iβ-K405A, caused a 1.5–2-fold inhibition of HUVEC migration, a dynamic process highly dependent on focal adhesion formation and disassembly. These results indicate that cGK I phosphorylation of VASP results in loss of VASP and zyxin from focal adhesions, a response that could contribute to cGK alteration of cytoskeleton-regulated processes such as cell migration. cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (cGK I), a major constituent of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)/nitric oxide/cGMP signal transduction pathway, phosphorylates the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

The cGMP produced by these cyclases has multiple effectors within the cell, including cGMP-gated channels, cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases, and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs). cGK I (including α- and β-splice variants) and cGK II have been identified in mammalian cells. The cGK I studied here is a major mediator of the nitric oxide/cGMP signal transduction pathway in several tissues (1Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar); and recently, the functional role of cGK I in relaxation of smooth muscle, inhibition of Ca2+ transients, and inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation was consolidated by data from cGK I knockout mice (2Pfeifer A.

Med. 1999; 189: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cGK I is present in only certain endothelial cells, and only these respond to cGMP with a reduction in thrombin-induced calcium transients and paracellular permeability (4Draijer R. Atsma D.E. van der Laarse A. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,5Draijer R. Vaandrager A.B. Nolte C. de Jonge H.R. Walter U. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The relationship between cGK I substrate phosphorylation and cellular function is still an emerging field and is the subject of this investigation. One extensively studied substrate of cGK I is the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), originally discovered in human platelets (6Halbrügge M. Friedrich C. Eigenthaler M. Schanzenbacher P. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3088-3093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but a substrate of cGK I in many cells, including endothelial cells (1Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B.

Walter U. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In platelets, both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP closely correlate with inhibition of agonist-induced aggregation and in particular with inhibition of fibrinogen receptor (integrin αIIbβ3) activation (7Horstrup K. Jablonka B. Hönig-Liedl P. Just M. Kochsiek K. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In knockout mice lacking endogenous VASP, cGMP-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation was reduced, and agonist-induced platelet activation was enhanced (8Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Ahmad M. Glauner M.

Similarly, knockout mice lacking endogenous cGK I also displayed defective cGMP-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation (3Massberg S. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Bauer M. Pfeifer A. Siess W. Fässler R. Ruth P. Krombach F. Hofmann F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP (only Ser157 was measurable at that time), but not cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP, disappeared from the platelets of cGK I knockout mice (3Massberg S. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Bauer M. Pfeifer A. Siess W. Fässler R. Ruth P. Krombach F. Hofmann F. J. Exp.

Vaandrager A.B. Nolte C. de Jonge H.R. Walter U. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), clear evidence that cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP is mediated by cGK and not by activation of cAK. In contrast, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP is mediated by cAK.In cells studied so far, VASP has been shown to be localized at highly dynamic membrane regions, focal adhesions, and cell-cell contacts and in a periodic pattern along stress fibers (11Reinhard M.

Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 168-171Google Scholar). Recently, VASP-related proteins (now designated as members of the Ena/VASP protein family), which share some structural and functional characteristics with VASP, were identified (13Gertler F.B.

Demonstration of VASP interaction with other proteins present at several intracellular sites suggested a role for VASP in cytoskeletal function. The N-terminal Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domain of the Ena/VASP protein family was shown to interact with a proline-rich FP4-containing motif present in the focal adhesion proteins zyxin and vinculin (15Niebuhr K.

The central VASP domain containing four copies of a GP5 motif binds profilin, an actin regulatory protein that has been shown to promote F-actin assembly (22Reinhard M. Giehl K. Abel K. Haffner C. Jarchau T. Hoppe V. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In addition, the VASP C-terminal EVH2 domain was shown to bind F-actin and to facilitate actin bundling (23Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and also to be responsible for tetramerization of VASP (23Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), which may stabilize interactions of the VASP EVH1 domain with the focal adhesion proteins vinculin and zyxin (26Reinhard M. Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).VASP is phosphorylated by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases on Ser157, located just distal to the EVH1 domain in the central proline-rich domain of VASP, and on Ser239and Thr278, located in the VASP C-terminal EVH2 domain (23Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar,25Haffner C. Jarchau T. Reinhard M. Hoppe J. Lohmann S.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So far, only phosphorylation of Ser157 and Ser239 has been demonstrated to be of major significance in intact cells (27Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of these sites can be distinguished using specific antibodies (28Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K.

The phosphorylation site containing Ser157 is preferred by cAK, whereas the site containing Ser239 is preferred by cGK in vitroand in intact cells; however, both kinases phosphorylate all three sites (27Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K. Hönig-Liedl P.

Information is, however, scarce concerning the influence of cGMP-mediated VASP phosphorylation on the described VASP interactions with other proteins or on cytoskeletal function. Furthermore, studies on many cell types, including endothelial cells, are hampered by the rapid decline in cGK levels in cell culturing and passaging (5Draijer R. Vaandrager A.B. Nolte C. de Jonge H.R. Walter U. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Chiche J.D. Schlutsmeyer S.M. Bloch D.B. de la Monte S.M.

Therefore, in this work, we present a system for studying the effect of VASP phosphorylation, using endothelial cells lacking endogenous cGK I, in the absence and presence of expressed cGK I. cGK I phosphorylation of VASP promoted detachment of VASP (but not a triple phosphorylation site mutant of VASP) and zyxin from focal adhesions, thus altering the composition and possible functional integrity of these structures. In support of this, cGK I also inhibited collagen-, fibronectin-, and fibrinogen-mediated endothelial cell migration, which is a highly dynamic process dependent on focal adhesion formation and destruction.DISCUSSIONExpression and activation of cGK Iβ (but not a catalytically inactive cGK Iβ-K405A mutant) in primary cultures of HUVECs resulted in depletion of several cytoskeletal proteins from focal adhesions, beginning with VASP and zyxin within 30 min and later vinculin, followed by microfilament disruption, thus causing a destabilization of motility structures that may contribute to the observed cGK I-dependent inhibition of HUVEC migration. Of the cytoskeletal proteins affected, only VASP is a known cGK I substrate, suggesting that perhaps VASP phosphorylation leads to the subsequent chain of events. In the past, few effects of VASP phosphorylation have been reported. The localization of the Ser157phosphorylation site in the central domain of VASP, in close proximity to the binding site for profilin, suggested an influence of VASP phosphorylation on VASP/profilin interaction; however, in vitro binding of VASP to matrix-bound profilin was not grossly altered by VASP phosphorylation (22Reinhard M. Giehl K. Abel K. Haffner C. Jarchau T. Hoppe V. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Recently, only VASP phosphorylation on Ser157 was analyzed and suggested to enhance VASP affinity for F-actin in vitro (20Laurent V. Loisel T.P. Harbeck B. Wehman A. Grobe L. Jockusch B.M. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar); however, the contribution of the other VASP phosphorylation sites was not investigated.In this study, all three VASP phosphorylation sites were investigated in intact cells using a combination of site-specific antibodies and site-specific mutation. In particular, VSV-tagged VASP mutants that could be expressed and distinguished from endogenous VASP were used to demonstrate that direct VASP phosphorylation was required for VASP detachment from focal adhesions since the VSV-tagged VASP-AAA triple phosphorylation mutant was highly resistant to 8-pCPT-cGMP-dependent detachment from focal adhesions in comparison with wild-type VASP. However, in the absence of 8-pCPT-cGMP, all phosphorylation site mutants of VASP were targeted to focal adhesions and showed a periodic distribution along stress fibers, suggesting that the mutations did not induce any major changes in the tertiary structure of VASP. VASP detachment from focal adhesions was inhibited only if all three phosphorylation sites were mutated, suggesting that all three sites are important for regulation of VASP interaction with cytoskeletal components. Ser157 is located just distal to the VASP EVH1 domain, and Ser239 and Thr278 are located in the VASP EVH2 domain (12Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Reinhard K. Walter U. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 168-171Google Scholar, 23Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Specific functions ascribed to these domains are consistent with our results that point mutations of phosphorylation sites close to and within these domains affect VASP localization at focal adhesions. VASP truncation and other experiments have shown that both the EVH1 and EVH2 domains are involved in VASP localization at focal adhesions and that the EVH2 domain affects the function and binding properties of the EVH1 domain (discussed in Ref. 23Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Additional data clearly demonstrated that both EVH1 and EVH2 domains of Ena/VASP family members are essential but alone not sufficient for the overall function of these proteins (43Ahern-Djamali S.M.

Furthermore, during the review process for our manuscript, another publication appeared demonstrating that expression of the EVH2 domain in keratinocytes inhibited VASP function in adhesion zipper and epithelial sheet formation; and in keratinocytes of transgenic mice overexpressing the EVH2 domain, abnormalities in intercellular adhesion were observed (44Vasioukhin V.

Thus, it is highly conceivable that Ser278 phosphorylation, in combination with Ser157 and Ser239 phosphorylation, could affect important VASP functions, ultimately resulting in a major effect like VASP displacement from focal adhesions.The exact role of each individual VASP phosphorylation site in either VASP loss from or recovery to focal adhesions is not clear. It was noted, however, that after 3 h of ANP treatment, VASP localization at focal adhesions began to recover concomitant with a relative loss of Ser157 phosphorylation. This was not observed after 3 h of 8-pCPT-cGMP treatment, most likely due to the greater metabolic stability of this cGMP analog in comparison with unmodified cGMP formed in response to ANP. It is possible that incomplete VASP phosphorylation is insufficient for initiating VASP removal from focal adhesions and perhaps sufficient for its recovery. All available data support the interpretation that all three VASP phosphorylation sites are critical for the interaction of VASP with focal adhesion components. This complexity is perhaps not surprising since VASP interacts via its EVH1 and EVH2 domains with at least two distinct components present in focal adhesions, FP4 motif-containing proteins (e.g. zyxin and vinculin) and F-actin, as discussed below.In comparison with VASP, VASP-related proteins show conservation of only Ser157 and Ser239 (Mena), only Ser157 (Evl), or no sites (Ena), suggesting that VASP homologs may display different regulation in response to phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of these sites has not been extensively studied, but a cAK-induced shift in Mena migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been shown (14Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), and our 16C2 antibody detects phosphorylation of Mena, probably at Ser376 homologous to VASP Ser239. 3A. Smolenski, unpublished data.Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of Ena on other sites by Abl tyrosine kinase attenuates Ena association with profilin or SH3 domain-containing proteins, and mutation of these phosphorylation sites partially impairs the in vivo function of Ena, indicating that phosphorylation is required for optimal Ena function (45Comer A.R. Ahern-Djamali S.M. Juang J.L. Jackson P.D. Hoffmann F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation state has also been shown to regulate focal adhesion localization of other proteins. Paxillin dephosphorylation on tyrosine resulted in its loss from focal adhesions in response to cAMP (46Han J.D. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29211-29215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas serine and threonine phosphorylation has been shown to accelerate fibronectin-induced localization of paxillin to focal adhesions (47Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, serine phosphorylation of talin in response to interleukin-1β decreased talin's focal adhesion localization (48Qwarnström E.E. MacFarlane S.A. Page R.C. Dower S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and phorbol ester stimulation of protein kinase C increased talin serine phosphorylation and talin removal from focal adhesions (49Turner C.E. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11938-11944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cGK I regulation of focal adhesion constituents exemplifies “inside-out” regulation of adhesion sites by yet a new signal transduction pathway.Our results in intact cells provide a physiological correlate to the previous demonstrations of in vitro interactions between VASP and either zyxin or vinculin (26Reinhard M. Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Reinhard M. Jouvenal K. Tripier D. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7956-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These interactions were demonstrated using one solid phase (nitrocellulose, column, or microtiter plate)-bound partner to bind another from solution. More recently, VASP and vinculin have also been shown to co-immunoprecipitate after in situ cross-linking experiments (50Hüttelmaier S. Mayboroda O. Harbeck B. Jarchau T. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The direct binding partner that attaches VASP to focal adhesions is unclear, although vinculin and zyxin are likely candidates since they have been shown to directly interact, via their FP4 motifs, with the N-terminal EVH1 domain of proteins of the Ena/VASP protein family (15Niebuhr K.

A. 1995; 92: 7956-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and injection of peptides containing the FP4 motif into human fibroblasts and HeLa cells caused a depletion of VASP from focal adhesions, resulting in a diffuse cytosolic distribution of VASP (15Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 17Pistor S. Chakraborty T. Walter U. Wehland J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 517-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the role of the Ena/VASP family EVH2 domain is not entirely clear, it does appear to regulate tetramerization, which is important for EVH1 domain interactions with other proteins, including ones present at focal adhesions (23Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Detachment of VASP and zyxin from focal adhesions may also have additional cellular consequences since zyxin has been shown to shuttle between focal contacts and the nucleus in fibroblasts (51Nix D.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Prolonged effects of 8-pCPT-cGMP treatment were also observed after VASP phosphorylation and disappearance from focal adhesions. A progressive reduction of the actin microfilament system and vinculin at focal adhesions was observed, which was complete after 3 h of 8-pCPT-cGMP treatment. VASP influence on the microfilament system may be related to the role shown for VASP in enhancing actin assembly required for Listeria motility (15Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E.

FP4domain-containing proteins were also implicated in bacterial motility since motility was blocked by peptides containing the FP4motif (52Southwick F.S. Purich D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5168-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In mammalian aortic smooth muscle and endothelial cells, disassembly of focal adhesions induced by thrombospondin and tenascin has recently been suggested to be mediated by cGK I, although GMP-dependent protein kinase I alone had no effect (53Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Pallero M.A. Boerth N. Greenwood J.A. Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, cGK I stimulation resulted in loss of proteins from focal adhesions, and this was not mimicked by a catalytically inactive cGK Iβ-K405A mutant. This mutant is not only itself inactive, but could also compete with wild-type cGK I for the cGMP analog. Although it was not clear whether mutant and wild-type cGKs I could form heterodimers, this did not seem to be the case since a large ratio of mutant to wild-type cGK I was required for inhibition of wild-type cGK I, and inhibition could be overcome by increasing the cGMP analog concentration. Furthermore, a heterodimer holoenyzme might still display activity since even cGK I monomers demonstrate catalytic activity (54Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4157-4162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).cGK I effects on focal adhesion integrity may also underlie the observation that cGK I and VASP have been implicated in inhibition of fibrinogen binding to its integrin receptor, αIIbβ3.

https://openalex.org/W2030883124,"Long chain curarimimetic toxins from snake venom bind with high affinities to both muscular type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) (Kd in the pm range) and neuronal α7-AChRs (Kd in the nmrange). To understand the molecular basis of this dual function, we submitted α-cobratoxin (α-Cbtx), a typical long chain curarimimetic toxin, to an extensive mutational analysis. By exploring 36 toxin mutants, we found that Trp-25, Asp-27, Phe-29, Arg-33, Arg-36, and Phe-65 are involved in binding to both neuronal and Torpedo(Antil, S., Servent, D., and Ménez, A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 34851–34858) AChRs and that some of them (Trp-25, Asp-27, and Arg-33) have similar binding energy contributions for the two receptors. In contrast, Ala-28, Lys-35, and Cys-26–Cys-30 selectively bind to the α7-AChR, whereas Lys-23 and Lys-49 bind solely to the Torpedo AChR. Therefore, α-Cbtx binds to two AChR subtypes using both common and specific residues. Double mutant cycle analyses suggested that Arg-33 in α-Cbtx is close to Tyr-187 and Pro-193 in the α7 receptor. Since Arg-33 of another curarimimetic toxin is close to the homologous αTyr-190 of the muscular receptor (Ackermann, E. J., Ang, E. T. H., Kanter, J. R., Tsigelny, I., and Taylor, P. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 10958–10964), toxin binding probably occurs in homologous regions of neuronal and muscular AChRs. However, no coupling was seen between α-Cbtx Arg-33 and α7 receptor Trp-54, Leu-118, and Asp-163, in contrast to what was observed in a homologous situation involving another toxin and a muscular receptor (Osaka, H., Malany, S., Molles, B. E., Sine, S. M., and Taylor, P. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 5478–5484). Therefore, although occurring in homologous regions, the detailed modes of toxin binding to α7 and muscular receptors are likely to be different.

Pergamon Press Inc., New York1991: 165-222Google Scholar). All these toxins adopt a leaf-like shape with three adjacent loops rich in β-sheet that emerge from a small globular core where four disulfide bonds are invariably located (3Basus V.J. Song G. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12290-12298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4Low B.W. Corfield P.W.R. Eur. J.

Notwithstanding their common fold and their similar biological function, α-neurotoxins are currently classified as short chain toxins with 60–62 residues and four disulfide bonds and long chain toxins with 66–74 residues and five disulfide bonds. In agreement with this old chemically based classification, we recently showed that the long chain toxins are also and uniquely capable of binding with high affinity to the neuronal α7 receptor (8Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These preliminary data also indicated that the neuron-specific binding capacity may be associated with the unique presence in the long chain toxins of a small cyclic loop at the tip of their central loop. The goal of this work was therefore to identify as precisely as possible the determinants by which long chain toxins bind to the neuronal α7-AChR and to compare them with those involved when toxins bind to the muscular AChR. The toxin used in this study is α-cobratoxin (α-Cbtx) (9Ménez A. Servent D. Rapuolli R. Montecucco C. Guidebook to Protein Toxins and Their Use in Cell Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 194-195Google Scholar) fromNaja naja siamensis (probably Naja kaouthia(10Wüster W. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)). It is a prototype of long chain curarimimetic toxins with a single polypeptide chain of 71 amino acids and five disulfide bonds. α-Cbtx binds with high affinity to the muscular type AChR fromTorpedo marmorata (Kd = 58 pm) and the neuronal α7-AChR (Kd = 9 nm). Its three-dimensional structure is known from both NMR (11Le Goas R. Laplante S.R. Mikou A. Delsuc M.A. Guittet E. Robin M. Charpentier I. Lallemand J.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4867-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallographic studies (12Betzel C. Lange G. Pal G.P. Wilson K.S. Maelicke A. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21530-21536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently submitted this toxin to an extensive site-directed mutagenesis and found that the residues by which it binds to the Torpedo AChR include a number of amino acids that are highly conserved throughout the family of curarimimetic toxins (13Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These are Lys-23, Trp-25, Asp-27, Phe-29, and Arg-33, which belong to the concave face of the toxin loop II, and Lys-49, which belongs to the same face of loop III. The same residues of a short chain curarimimetic toxin are involved in binding to the same AChR (14Pillet L. Tremeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Trémeau O. Lemaire C. Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Ducancel F. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, however, long and short chain curarimimetic toxins use specific residues for binding to theTorpedo AChR. These specific residues are located in the C-terminal tail and in loop I of long and short chain toxins, respectively (13Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was 3-fold. First, using a set of 36 toxin mutants, we identified the residues by which α-Cbtx most likely binds to the neuronal α7 receptor. Second, we compared these data with those that previously indicated the residues by which the same toxin binds to the Torpedo AChR (13Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Third, to identify the regions of the α7 receptor that are recognized by the toxin, we mutated different residues in various functional loops of the α7 receptor and studied the effect of these mutations on toxin binding. Using a double mutant cycle approach, we then studied the possible proximity between receptor Tyr-187 and toxin Arg-33. This choice was based on previous findings that the homologous Tyr-190 of the α subunit of the muscular receptor is close to Arg-33 of another curarimimetic toxin (16Ackermann E.J. Ang E.T.H. Kanter J.R. Tsigelny I. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10958-10964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We also investigated other possible interactions between toxin Arg-33 and other receptor residues, including Trp-54, Leu-118, and Asp-163, whose homologs in the muscular receptor were observed to be in proximity to Arg-33 of another toxin (17Osaka H. Malany S. Molles B.E. Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5478-5484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together, our data strongly suggest the following. (i) Toxin binding presumably occurs in homologous regions of the muscular type AChR and the neuronal α7-AChR; however, the detailed modes of binding to both receptor subtypes are likely to be different. (ii) The same core of six residues (Trp-25, Asp-27, Phe-29, Arg-33, Arg-36, and Phe-65) is involved in the binding to both subtypes of AChRs. (iii) Three of these common residues (Phe-29, Arg-36, and Phe-65) contribute differently to the binding energy for the two AChRs. (iv) A number of additional residues are associated with the specific recognition of each receptor subtype. These are Ala-28, Lys-35, and Cys-26–Cys-30, which bind selectively to the neuronal AChR, and Lys-23 and Lys-49, which bind solely to the muscular type receptor. These results offer an explanation as to how a toxic protein recognizes two members of a receptor family and provide a molecular basis for the design of new toxins that may be more specific to these and other subtypes of the AChR family. Wild-type and mutant recombinant α-cobratoxins were obtained as described previously (13Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding Cbtx was cloned into the pCP vector (18Drevet P. Lemaire C. Gasparini S. ZinnJustin S. Lajeunesse E. Ducancel F. Pinkasfeld S. Courcon M. Tremeau O. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The fused toxin was purified on an IgG-Sepharose column, cleaved by CNBr, refolded with 4 mm GSH and 2 mm GSSG, and purified on a reverse-phase C4 column. The α-Cbtx mutants described here were prepared using the QuickChangeTM kit (Stratagene), and the sequence of the entire gene was checked by automatic sequencing (ABI PRISMTM 310 genetic analyses, (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Biochemical and biophysical characterization of each mutant was assessed by (i) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining, (ii) analytical reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac C45-μm column, 0.46 × 25 cm), and (iii) electrospray mass spectroscopy and circular dichroic analysis as described previously (13Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified Cbtx was determined by measuring the absorbance at 278 nm of a given solution of toxin and by amino acid analysis. A chimeric cDNA of a neuronal type nicotinic receptor (α7/5-HT3) was transfected into HEK-293 cells by calcium precipitation as described previously (8Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y.

Two days after the transfection, the cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA, washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, and finally resuspended in 3 ml of this buffer/plate for the binding experiments. The receptor mutants were obtained using the QuickChangeTMkit according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and their sequences were checked by sequencing. The affinities of the toxins for the α7/5-HT3 receptor were determined as described previously (8Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol.

Competition experiments showed the effect of wild-type and mutant recombinant α-cobratoxins on the initial rate of 125I-bungarotoxin (Bgtx) binding. Different concentrations of α-Cbtx were preincubated for 4.5 h with cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and filtered 6 min after the addition of 5 nm125I-Bgtx. This preincubation time was checked to be sufficient to reach equilibrium binding between wild-type or mutant toxins and the receptor (no change after overnight preincubation). Furthermore, the association and dissociation kinetics of 125I-Bgtx for the Y187F receptor mutant were determined and showed that no significant dissociation of the tracer occurred during the 6-min time of the assay and that, after this time, the rate of association of 125I-Bgtx was still linear. The protection constant (Kp) calculated by fitting the competition data to the empirical Hill equation was shown to correspond to the dissociation constants (20Corringer P.J. Galzi J.L. Eiselé J.L.

Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 15-34PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant α-Cbtx was produced as a fusion protein in E. coli as described previously (13Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The final yield of toxin after purification, cleavage, and refolding reached ∼1.5 mg/liter of culture. To identify the residues by which α-Cbtx binds with high affinity to the neuronal α7 receptor, we produced 36 mutants and hence probed the role of 34 of its 71 residues. The explored positions included all the residues of the toxin loop I, from Phe-4 to Asp-13. They also included all residues (Tyr-21, Lys-23, Trp-25, Arg-36, and Asp-38) of the concave face of loop II, the two faces being defined by the large β-sheet that encompasses the three toxin loops. We also explored Lys-35 in loop II, which points toward the other direction, and all residues at the tip of loop II, from Asp-27 to Arg-33, including the disulfide bond Cys-26–Cys-30. Three residues of loop III (Thr-47, Lys-49, and Asp-53) and two residues of the C-terminal tail (Phe-65 and Pro-66) were also investigated. Finally, the role of the C-terminal fragment was further explored by deleting the five last residues (mutant Δ66). The final yield of toxin after purification, cleavage, and refolding varied between 0.5 and 1.5 mg/liter of culture. The far-UV CD spectra of all mutants were virtually superimposable with that of the venom-purified or wild-type recombinant α-Cbtx (data not shown). Also, the mass of each mutant, as determined by electrospray mass analyses, was identical, within experimental error, to the theoretical calculated mass (data not shown). Therefore, the wild-type and mutant recombinant toxins displayed all the expected physicochemical characteristics. We investigated the capacity of wild-type and mutant toxins to inhibit the binding of 125I-Bgtx to a recombinant form of a chimeric version of the chicken α7 receptor. In this version, the extracellular part of the neuronal α7-type receptor was fused to the membrane and cytoplasmic regions of the 5-HT3receptor (19Eiselé J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This chimeric construction allowed efficient expression in HEK-293 cells and behaved like the wild-type α7 receptor in many respects (19Eiselé J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), including its capacity to be selectively blocked by various long chain curarimimetic toxins (8Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V.

A number of typical inhibition binding curves obtained with different α-Cbtx mutants are shown in Fig. 1. Binding affinities of α-Cbtx for neuronal α7 receptors were deduced from the inhibition binding curves and were fitted to the Hill equation. We commonly found Hill coefficients equal to 1.15 ± 0.25, which suggests a homogeneous class of toxin-binding sites, in agreement with the homopentameric nature of the α7 receptor. The protection constants (Table I) derived from these curves have been suggested to correspond to apparentKd values (22Weber M. Changeux J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 15-34PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, wild-type recombinant α-Cbtx and the venom toxin are characterized by virtually identicalKd values of 9 ± 3 and 7.5 ± 1.5 nm, respectively. This result further confirms the identity of the recombinant and venom toxins.Table IDissociation constants of wild-type and mutant α-cobratoxins for the α7/5-HT3 receptorKpKp′/KpΔΔGnmkcal/molVenom Cbtx7.5 ± 1.50.83−0.11Cbtx rec9.0 ± 310.00Loop I F4A19.4 ± 42.10.43 I5A20.1 ± 22.20.46 T6A17.4 ± 31.90.38 P7A9.0 ± 110.00 D8A11.5 ± 0.51.30.17 D8R12.2 ± 1.81.40.19 I9A18.1 ± 220.41 T10A9.5 ± 0.51.10.05 S11A14.2 ± 11.60.27 K12E22.3 ± 92.50.53 D13A8.3 ± 0.50.9−0.08Loop II Y21F12.5 ± 11.40.19 K23E24.5 ± 2.52.70.57 W25F9.1 ± 0.610.00 W25H36 ± 440.81 W25A53.5 ± 761.1 D27N27.2 ± 2.530.64 D27R450 ± 85502.28 A28G48 ± 75.41 A28R9.5 ± 21.10.05 F29L24.5 ± 4.52.70.57 F29W6.1 ± 0.20.7−0.21 F29A667 ± 128742.51 C26S/C30S125 ± 2713.91.54 S31A16 ± 61.80.34 I32A18 ± 220.40 R33E3055 ± 4003393.40 K35A99 ± 6111.40 R36A145 ± 15161.62 D38L4.1 ± 0.50.45−0.46Loop III T47A9.5 ± 0.61.10.05 K49E29 ± 33.20.68 D53K7.2 ± 0.40.8−0.13C-terminal F65A139 ± 2615.51.60 P66A24 ± 12.70.57 Δ6630 ± 43.30.70Protection constants (means ± S.E.) were obtained from at least three different competition experiments in duplicate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ΔΔG is the difference in free energy of binding between wild-type and mutant α-cobratoxins.

Cbtx rec, recombinant wild-type toxin. All residues of loop I were mutated, but none of the introduced mutations caused more than a 3-fold affinity decrease, which corresponds to a change in free energy of binding of 0.5 kcal/mol. Clearly, none of the residues of loop I individually plays a key binding role with the neuronal α7 receptor (Table I). In contrast, as many as nine residues from loop II (Trp-25, Asp-27, Ala-28, Phe-29, Cys-26–Cys-30, Arg-33, Lys-35, and Arg-36) were sensitive to mutations, with affinity decreases ranging from 5- to 340-fold (Fig. 1 and Table I). Six of these residues (Trp-25, Asp-27, Ala-28, Phe-29, Arg-33, and Arg-36) have their side chain essentially accessible from the concave face of loop II, this face being defined by the large β-sheet displayed by the three fingers (see Fig. 4). Mutation R33E caused the greatest effect, with a decrease of 340-fold in the α-Cbtx binding affinity (Table I). Arg-33 may therefore be the toxin residue that contributes the most to the α-Cbtx-receptor recognition process. Although perhaps less critical, the other arginine of the toxin loop II (Arg-36) may also be functionally important since its mutation to alanine caused a 16-fold affinity decrease. Mutation of Trp-25 to alanine caused a weak affinity decrease, suggesting the moderate functional contribution of the indole ring. However, replacement of Trp-25 by phenylalanine or histidine had virtually no effect on toxin affinity, indicating that an aromatic side chain of variable size can be accommodated at this position (Table I). A 50-fold decrease in binding affinity was observed in mutation D27R, indicating that the presence of the bulky and positively charged arginine is unfavorable at this position. This does not mean that the presence of a negative charge at position 27 is an important element since mutation D27N caused no significant effect. More mutants are needed to understand better how Asp-27 contributes to binding. Mutation of Ala-28 to glycine caused a 5-fold affinity decrease, suggesting that a methyl group at this position may be involved in binding. Surprisingly, however, mutation of Ala-28 to arginine did not affect toxin affinity. This result suggests that position 28 can accommodate any residue whose side chain possesses some hydrophobic character. Of the three mutations introduced at Phe-29, only F29A caused an affinity decrease. This decrease was quite severe since it was associated with a binding energy change of 2.5 kcal/mol (Table I). In contrast, F29W had no effect, indicating that position 29 can accept the bulkier aromatic indole ring. It can also accommodate the hydrophobic, although not aromatic, leucine residue since mutant F29L has only a 3-fold lower affinity. Therefore, a strong hydrophobicity may be an important functional character at position 29, irrespective of whether it is brought by an aromatic or aliphatic side chain. The other mutation-sensitive residues in loop II (Cys-26–Cys-30 and Lys-35) have their side chain accessible from the convex face of the β-sheet. This result could indicate that mutation at any residue of the toxin loop II is followed by an affinity decrease and that our general approach may not reflect the actual binding contribution of the mutated residues. This is clearly not the case since various residues of loop II could be mutated without affecting toxin affinity. This is the case for the relatively close Asp-38, Ser-31, and Ile-32 and for the more remote Tyr-21. Therefore, the effect observed with mutations at Cys-26–Cys-30 and Lys-35 most likely indicates the involvement of these residues in binding to the receptor. The result obtained upon mutation of the two half-cystines Cys-26 and Cys-30 agrees with previous data based on reduction and chemical modification of this bond (8Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the affinity decrease observed upon mutation is substantially less than that found upon chemical modification. That the double mutation C26S/C30S caused an affinity decrease can be interpreted in at least two nonexclusive ways. First, the deletion of the bond between residues 26 and 30 modifies the local structural constraints of the small loop, which in turn may affect the spatial positioning and hence the functional contribution of one or more of the important residues (see above) Asp-27, Ala-28, and Phe-29. However, we previously observed that mutation C26S/C30S (13Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or reduction and carboxymethylation of the bond (8Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) caused virtually no effect on toxin binding to the Torpedo AChR, although this binding involved various residues in proximity to the disulfide bond, including Trp-25, Asp-27, and Phe-29. Therefore, we suspect that no major structural change occurred around the disulfide bond between residues 26 and 30. Second, the other explanation is that one or both of half-cystines 26 and 30 are involved in the binding to the neuronal receptor. This conclusion implies that the convex face of loop II may be functionally important. In agreement with this view, we found that Lys-35, whose side chain is accessible from the convex face of the toxin, is also functionally important, as judged from the 11-fold affinity decrease associated with its mutation to alanine. Therefore and in contrast to what was found upon binding to muscular type AChRs (13Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Pillet L. Tremeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7847-7855Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), binding to the neuronal AChR seems to involve residues located on both the concave and convex faces of the curarimimetic toxin. Previous mutational analyses indicated the functional importance of the highly conserved Lys-23 or Lys-49 in binding to muscular receptors (13Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It was not inconceivable that these residues could also be involved in binding to the neuronal receptor. However, this is not the case since inversion of their charge caused no effect on toxin affinity. Also, the two other residues (Thr-47 and Asp-53) of loop III seem to be excluded from the binding surface of the toxin, with mutations T47A and D53K causing no affinity decrease. The hydroxyl function of the invariant Tyr-21 is also unimportant since mutation Y21F had no effect on toxin affinity (Table I). Exploration of the toxin C-terminal tail provided a rather precise answer. Mutation F65A caused a 16-fold affinity decrease, whereas mutation of the adjacent proline to alanine had no effect. Furthermore, deletion of the whole 67–71 stretch (mutant Δ66) had no substantial effect on toxin binding affinity (Table I). Therefore, only Phe-65 seems to have a binding function. In conclusion, the work described above reveals that 10 residues (Trp-25, Asp-27, Ala-28, Phe-29, Cys-26–Cys-30, Arg-33, Lys-35, Arg-36, and Phe-65) are mutation-sensitive and may be involved in the surface by which α-Cbtx binds to the neuronal α7 receptor, whereas a large number of surrounding residues are mutation-insensitive and hence probably excluded from the binding surface. It was previously shown that the ligand-binding sites of the muscular AChR included, on one hand, three segments of the α subunit surrounding Tyr-93 (loop A), Trp-149 (loop B), and between residues 180 and 200 (loop C) and, on the other hand, four regions on the γ and δ subunits centered around Lys-34 (loop 1), Trp-55 (loop 2), Leu-119 (loop 3), and Asp-174 (loop 4) (reviewed in Ref. 25Tsigelny I.

To effect repair bothin vivo and in vitro, NER requires that these proteins function as complexes. In contrast to NER, BER requires fewer proteins to complete repair, and the BER enzymes can accomplishin vitro repair reactions in the absence of protein-protein interactions (5Lindahl T. Karran P. Wood R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T.

One way to expedite repair is to increase the velocity of a rate-limiting reaction in the pathway. An example of this for BER is the acceleration of the rate of deoxyribose phosphate removal by DNA polymerase β in the presence of human AP-endonuclease (HAP1 of APE1) (8Bennett R.A.O. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Another example is XPG protein functioning in the BER pathway (9Nouspikel T. Lalle P. Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Clarkson S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

XPG protein increases the reaction rate from 2–7-fold for in vitro excision of Tg by the hNTH protein (12Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D.

However, complex formation does not necessarily increase reaction rates.

In both pathways this coupling of repair to transcription occurs via complex formation. Nonetheless, not all adducts repaired by NER and BER are repaired using transcription-coupling. In NER, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and aminofluorene adducts are not repaired by a transcription coupled mechanism (25Tang M.-S. Bohr V.A. Zhang X.-S. Pierce J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol.

Similarly for BER, although transcription-coupled BER is observed for the repair of certain adducts, including Tg, not all BER occurs via such a mechanism. Repair ofN-methylpurines is not coupled to transcription, suggesting that the role of the XPG protein in BER is not universal (27Scicchitano D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18785-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Exposure of U2OS cells to ultraviolet light prevented the degradation of hHR23A, showing that ubiquination could be prevented in a situation that required hHR23 proteins to function in a repair complex. Previously the yeast homologue of the hHR23 proteins, Rad23, was linked to DNA repair and ubiquitination (44Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In a recent study, the hHR23 proteins were found to interact with the S5a subunit of the 26 S proteasome (45Hiyama H. Yokoi M.

Thus, the hHR23 proteins are associated with ubiquitin metabolic pathways in addition to NER.The MPG protein is a DNA glycosylase excising numerous modified DNA bases, including N-methylpurines (46Bouziane M.

Recently, the three-dimensional structure of DNA-MPG protein interaction was solved (51Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), showing that MPG protein binds to a DNA adduct without additional protein requirements. In addition to crystallographic data, in vitro and in vivo kinetic results showed that 7-meG excision by the MPG protein is not altered by complex formation (31Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, any complex formation of the MPG protein will not affect the relative rates of sequence context-dependent excision of 7-meG. Nonetheless, complex formation may have a role in accelerating the rate of the in vivo reaction.In this report, we demonstrate that the hHR23 proteins specifically interact with the MPG protein as DNA damage recognition accessory proteins (DDRAP). We also identify the binding domains of the MPG protein and hHR23 proteins critical for this interaction. Moreover, we show that the interaction of the MPG protein with hHR23 proteins stimulates the DNA glycosylase activity and is correlated to increased binding affinity of the MPG·hHR23 protein complex for the substrate. These data establish a link between the NER and BER pathways subject to regulation by the hHR23 proteins.DISCUSSIONUntil recently, general belief was that excision of damaged bases by BER glycosylases was independent of other proteins and that protein-protein interactions were more significant only after the initial removal of a damaged base during BER. We have now shown that two DDRAPs, hHR23A or -B, can increase the rate of excision of a damaged base by a DNA glycosylase.In BER, the rate-limiting step for repair is variable (31Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 59Srivastava D.K. Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Previous investigations show that the rate-limiting step for BER could occur at the DNA glycosylase, AP-endonuclease, or DNA polymerase β/AP lyase steps. hNTH protein-catalyzed BER of Tg is linked to transcription and depends on hXPG, since the two proteins interact and Tg excision in vitro is rate-limiting for BER (9Nouspikel T.

Excision of damaged bases by the MPG protein, however, is not coupled to transcription and is linked to hHR23 proteins (27Scicchitano D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Wang W. Sitaram A. Scicchitano D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, different protein-protein interactions can determine the rate of DNA glycosylase-mediated excision. Since DNA glycosylases were previously envisaged to act independently, their substrate ranges and kinetic parameters were defined in vitro using this assumption. The discovery of different DDRAPs requires that these substrate ranges and kinetic parameters be re-examined in light of protein-protein interactions.hHR23 proteins increase the affinity of DNA repair proteins for their substrates. An example of a complex with a similar role is the XPE complex of DDB1 and DDB2 (62Takao M. Abramic M. Moos Jr., M. Otrin V.R. Wootton J.C. McLenigan M. Levine A.S. Protic M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4111-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 63Abramic M. Levine A.S. Protic M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22493-22500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The XPE complex presumably increases the rate of 6-4 photoproduct recognition by the XPC·hHR23B complex (33Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The uniqueness of the hHR23 protein interaction with the MPG protein or the XPC protein is that these represent early steps in both BER and NER. Therefore, it is possible that the hHR23 protein interactions serve as a gate between BER and NER pathways. Fig. 7 is a scheme representing one-way hHR23 proteins could control excision repair. Adducts can be repaired by both BER and NER, and the recognition step could direct the pathway. If the MPG protein-hHR23 complex were more efficient at recognition, repair would proceed via BER, whereas efficient recognition by XPC-hHR23 would shift the equilibrium to NER. Therefore, the hHR23 proteins can connect both pathways. The model presented in Fig. 6suggests several hypotheses to test. In cells that are deficient in XPC protein, competition between BER and NER should be reduced, and the MPG protein-mediated repair of dimethyl sulfate damage should increase. This could be manifested as either an increased repair rate or an increased survival rate. On the other hand, if MPG is overexpressed and hHR23 proteins are bound, XPC-mediated repair of ultraviolet radiation should be decreased if there is a competition between XPC and MPG proteins for hHR23 binding. This could decrease survival, increase mutation rate, or reduce the repair rate of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Other questions also arise in light of these results. These include the generalization of DDRAPs for reactions of other DNA glycosylases. There is the possibility that DNA glycosylases and DNA glycosylase/AP lyases use different accessory proteins to effect repair. The hNTH protein, a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase is activated by the XPG protein, and MPG is activated by hHR23 proteins (12Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 13Bessho T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is possible that there are many accessory proteins or that only a few of these proteins function in damage recognition for excision repair. It is also necessary to examine the rate of excision of different lesions by these complexes. The hNTH protein excision of Tg is enhanced in the presence of the XPG, and the MPG protein excision of Hx is enhanced in the presence of the hHR23 proteins. The role of the accessory proteins in stimulating the excision of other substrates, for example dihydrothymine for hNTH protein or 3-methyladenine for MPG protein, however, is unknown. Future experiments will also include the investigation of substrates in longer DNA fragments to determine if there is a greater stimulation of the MPG protein activity compared with that observed in oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The results presented in this study provide a basis for pursuing such studies and provide a connection between the two separate branches of excision repair. Excision repair of DNA, which protects cells against numerous insults inflicted by both exogenous and endogenous agents, is subdivided into the NER1 and BER pathways. Extensive investigation of the NER pathway has revealed that more than 30 proteins are involved (1Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15915-15918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

To effect repair bothin vivo and in vitro, NER requires that these proteins function as complexes. In contrast to NER, BER requires fewer proteins to complete repair, and the BER enzymes can accomplishin vitro repair reactions in the absence of protein-protein interactions (5Lindahl T. Karran P. Wood R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T.

Despite the fact that BER enzymes generally do not require complex formation to catalyze in vitro reactions, such interplay can facilitate in vivo DNA repair. One way to expedite repair is to increase the velocity of a rate-limiting reaction in the pathway. An example of this for BER is the acceleration of the rate of deoxyribose phosphate removal by DNA polymerase β in the presence of human AP-endonuclease (HAP1 of APE1) (8Bennett R.A.O. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Another example is XPG protein functioning in the BER pathway (9Nouspikel T. Lalle P. Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Clarkson S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A.

XPG protein increases the reaction rate from 2–7-fold for in vitro excision of Tg by the hNTH protein (12Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D.

However, complex formation does not necessarily increase reaction rates. Examples of complex formation without activation of BER enzymatic activity in vitroinclude X-ray cross-complementing 1-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-DNA ligase III or uracil-DNA glycosylase-RPA protein (6Kubota Y.

In both pathways this coupling of repair to transcription occurs via complex formation. Nonetheless, not all adducts repaired by NER and BER are repaired using transcription-coupling. In NER, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and aminofluorene adducts are not repaired by a transcription coupled mechanism (25Tang M.-S. Bohr V.A. Zhang X.-S. Pierce J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol.

Similarly for BER, although transcription-coupled BER is observed for the repair of certain adducts, including Tg, not all BER occurs via such a mechanism. Repair ofN-methylpurines is not coupled to transcription, suggesting that the role of the XPG protein in BER is not universal (27Scicchitano D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Maekawa T. Tanaka K. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28019-28025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, the hHR23 proteins are associated with ubiquitin metabolic pathways in addition to NER. The MPG protein is a DNA glycosylase excising numerous modified DNA bases, including N-methylpurines (46Bouziane M. Miao F. Ye N. Holmquist G.P. Chyzak G. O'Connor T.R. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1998; 45: 191-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Singer B. Hang B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 713-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 48Chakravarti D. Ibeanu G.C. Tano K.

Recently, the three-dimensional structure of DNA-MPG protein interaction was solved (51Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), showing that MPG protein binds to a DNA adduct without additional protein requirements. In addition to crystallographic data, in vitro and in vivo kinetic results showed that 7-meG excision by the MPG protein is not altered by complex formation (31Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, any complex formation of the MPG protein will not affect the relative rates of sequence context-dependent excision of 7-meG. Nonetheless, complex formation may have a role in accelerating the rate of the in vivo reaction. In this report, we demonstrate that the hHR23 proteins specifically interact with the MPG protein as DNA damage recognition accessory proteins (DDRAP). We also identify the binding domains of the MPG protein and hHR23 proteins critical for this interaction. Moreover, we show that the interaction of the MPG protein with hHR23 proteins stimulates the DNA glycosylase activity and is correlated to increased binding affinity of the MPG·hHR23 protein complex for the substrate. These data establish a link between the NER and BER pathways subject to regulation by the hHR23 proteins. DISCUSSIONUntil recently, general belief was that excision of damaged bases by BER glycosylases was independent of other proteins and that protein-protein interactions were more significant only after the initial removal of a damaged base during BER. We have now shown that two DDRAPs, hHR23A or -B, can increase the rate of excision of a damaged base by a DNA glycosylase.In BER, the rate-limiting step for repair is variable (31Ye N. Holmquist G.P.

Previous investigations show that the rate-limiting step for BER could occur at the DNA glycosylase, AP-endonuclease, or DNA polymerase β/AP lyase steps. hNTH protein-catalyzed BER of Tg is linked to transcription and depends on hXPG, since the two proteins interact and Tg excision in vitro is rate-limiting for BER (9Nouspikel T.

Excision of damaged bases by the MPG protein, however, is not coupled to transcription and is linked to hHR23 proteins (27Scicchitano D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, different protein-protein interactions can determine the rate of DNA glycosylase-mediated excision. Since DNA glycosylases were previously envisaged to act independently, their substrate ranges and kinetic parameters were defined in vitro using this assumption. The discovery of different DDRAPs requires that these substrate ranges and kinetic parameters be re-examined in light of protein-protein interactions.hHR23 proteins increase the affinity of DNA repair proteins for their substrates. An example of a complex with a similar role is the XPE complex of DDB1 and DDB2 (62Takao M. Abramic M. Moos Jr., M. Otrin V.R. Wootton J.C. McLenigan M. Levine A.S. Protic M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4111-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 63Abramic M. Levine A.S. Protic M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22493-22500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The XPE complex presumably increases the rate of 6-4 photoproduct recognition by the XPC·hHR23B complex (33Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The uniqueness of the hHR23 protein interaction with the MPG protein or the XPC protein is that these represent early steps in both BER and NER. Therefore, it is possible that the hHR23 protein interactions serve as a gate between BER and NER pathways. Fig. 7 is a scheme representing one-way hHR23 proteins could control excision repair. Adducts can be repaired by both BER and NER, and the recognition step could direct the pathway. If the MPG protein-hHR23 complex were more efficient at recognition, repair would proceed via BER, whereas efficient recognition by XPC-hHR23 would shift the equilibrium to NER. Therefore, the hHR23 proteins can connect both pathways. The model presented in Fig. 6suggests several hypotheses to test. In cells that are deficient in XPC protein, competition between BER and NER should be reduced, and the MPG protein-mediated repair of dimethyl sulfate damage should increase. This could be manifested as either an increased repair rate or an increased survival rate. On the other hand, if MPG is overexpressed and hHR23 proteins are bound, XPC-mediated repair of ultraviolet radiation should be decreased if there is a competition between XPC and MPG proteins for hHR23 binding. This could decrease survival, increase mutation rate, or reduce the repair rate of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Other questions also arise in light of these results. These include the generalization of DDRAPs for reactions of other DNA glycosylases. There is the possibility that DNA glycosylases and DNA glycosylase/AP lyases use different accessory proteins to effect repair. The hNTH protein, a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase is activated by the XPG protein, and MPG is activated by hHR23 proteins (12Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is possible that there are many accessory proteins or that only a few of these proteins function in damage recognition for excision repair. It is also necessary to examine the rate of excision of different lesions by these complexes. The hNTH protein excision of Tg is enhanced in the presence of the XPG, and the MPG protein excision of Hx is enhanced in the presence of the hHR23 proteins. The role of the accessory proteins in stimulating the excision of other substrates, for example dihydrothymine for hNTH protein or 3-methyladenine for MPG protein, however, is unknown. Future experiments will also include the investigation of substrates in longer DNA fragments to determine if there is a greater stimulation of the MPG protein activity compared with that observed in oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The results presented in this study provide a basis for pursuing such studies and provide a connection between the two separate branches of excision repair.

https://openalex.org/W2082747505,"Studies in yeasts and mammals have identified many genes important for DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation, including Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1; however, the functions of these gene products are unknown. In this study we show by immunolocalization that human Rad9 (hRad9) is localized exclusively in the nucleus. However, hRad9 was readily released from the nucleus into the soluble extract upon biochemical fractionation of un-irradiated cells. In contrast, DNA damage promptly converted hRad9 to an extraction-resistant form that was retained at discrete sites within the nucleus. Conversion of hRad9 to the extraction-resistant nuclear form occurred in response to diverse DNA-damaging agents and the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea but not other cytotoxic stimuli. Additionally, extraction-resistant hRad9 interacted with its binding partners, hHus1 and an inducibly phosphorylated form of hRad1. Thus, these studies demonstrate that hRad9 is a nuclear protein that becomes more firmly anchored to nuclear components after DNA damage, consistent with a proximal function in DNA damage-activated checkpoint signaling pathways.

Many of the genes controlling checkpoint activation were identified by genetic studies in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae andSchizosaccharomyces pombe. Recently, homologs of the yeast checkpoint genes were identified in higher eukaryotes, suggesting that much of the checkpoint machinery is highly conserved (7–23). Detailed biochemical and genetic studies in both mammals and yeasts provide a working model for checkpoint activation. Central to this model are the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs)1 (1Dasika G.K. Lin S.-C.J. Zhao S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Lee E.Y.-H.P.

Epistasis experiments in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae indicate that spRad1 (scRad17) and spRad9 (scDdc1) function in the same pathway (5Lowndes N.F. Murguia J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Rad1 has homology with Ustilago maydisRec1 (40Long K.E. Sunnerhagen P. Subramani S. Gene. 1994; 148: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is a checkpoint protein and a 3′-5′ exonuclease, suggesting that Rad1 may participate in DNA metabolic events that are required for checkpoint activation. However, it is unclear whether human or S. pombe Rad1 also possesses nuclease activity (12Freire R. Murguia J.R. Tarsounas M. Lowndes N.F. Moens P.B. Jackson S.P.

In addition, recombinant hRad9 has recently been shown to possess 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (41Bessho T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rad1, hRad9, and hHus1 are all predicted to have structural homology with the sliding clamp protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (39Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G.

Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which encircles DNA and tethers DNA polymerase δ to the DNA. These predicted structural similarities raise the intriguing possibility that Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 may form clamp-like structures that localize to DNA in response to damage. Taken together, these observations have given rise to a tentative model in which Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 are early participants in a DNA damage-signaling pathway, with the proteins possibly acting as sensors that scan the genome for damage (5Lowndes N.F. Murguia J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 6Caspari T. Carr A.M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) This hypothesis, however, has not been experimentally validated, and the biochemical functions of hRad9 and its binding partners, hRad1 and hHus1, are unknown. In the present study we addressed the biochemical role of hRad9 by analyzing its cellular location, its interactions with DNA after damage, and its interactions with other checkpoint proteins. We show that in response to DNA damage the hRad9·hHus1·hRad1 checkpoint complex redistributes into a less extractable, chromatin-bound form, suggesting that these proteins have a proximal function in the DNA damage-signaling pathway. Rabbit antisera that recognize hRad9, hHus1, hRad1, and hRad17 have been described previously (38Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). hRad9 antibodies were affinity-purified using hexahistidine-tagged hRad9 as an affinity matrix. Insoluble, bacterially expressed His6-hRad9 was purified from bacterial lysates using standard techniques. The purified protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were stained with Ponceau S, and the His6-hRad9 band was excised. The strips were blocked for 1 h with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20. The strips were then incubated overnight with rabbit antiserum and washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 m NaCl. Anti-hRad9 antibodies were eluted by incubation in 100 mmglycine, pH 2.3, for 5 min. The eluate was then immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Monoclonal antibodies against hRad9 were generated by the Mayo monoclonal antibody core facility by immunizing BALB/c mice with His6-hRad9. Human K562 myeloid leukemia cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells, non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 cells, and apparently normal lymphoblasts (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To biochemically isolate cellular fractions that were enriched in nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, and microsomes, exponentially growing K562 cells (1 × 108/assay point) were treated with nothing or 50 gray (Gy) of ionizing radiation (IR). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffer saline and resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 nmmicrocystin-LR) and incubated on ice for 20 min. All the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were then Dounce-homogenized, checked for complete lysis by trypan blue staining, and adjusted to 250 mm sucrose with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 m sucrose. Cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to collect the nuclei-containing pellet. The supernatant was then serially centrifuged to collect the mitochondria-containing pellet (4000 × g, 15 min) and the remaining particulate fractions (lysosome and microsome) (105,000 × g, 2 h). Each pellet was solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The 105,000 × g supernatant (S100) was adjusted to 10% trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice for 20 min, and the protein was collected by centrifugation. The acetone-washed pellet was solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cell-equivalent volumes from each cell fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for hRad9 and the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase (Molecular Probes) and the nuclear marker B23 (43Fields A.P. Kaufmann S.H. Shaper J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 164: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing K562 cells (1 × 107/sample) were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in low salt permeabilization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml digitonin) containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Nuclei were washed with permeabilization buffer and then extracted with high salt nuclear extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 nmmicrocystin-LR, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate for 10 min at 4 °C. This buffer has a conductivity equivalent to a 250 mm NaCl solution. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 22,000 ×g for 10 min. Lysates were either immunoprecipitated as indicated or mixed with one-third volume 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Aliquots derived from equivalent cell numbers (unless otherwise specified) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and immunoblotted as described (38Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). Cells were irradiated with a 137Cs source at a dose rate of 10.8 Gy/min. 4-Nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO), etoposide, camptothecin, and paclitaxel were obtained from Sigma and dissolved in Me2SO and stored at −80 °C. Hydroxyurea (Sigma) and flavopiridol were prepared fresh in PBS. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, K562 cells were permeabilized and fractionated as described above; however, the nuclear extraction buffer was replaced with permeabilization buffer supplemented with 250 mm NaCl. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-hRad9 antibodies and protein G-Sepharose or with the indicated rabbit polyclonal antisera and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in permeabilization buffer supplemented with 250 mm NaCl, boiled for 5 min in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. For the λ-protein phosphatase experiments, hRad9 immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing 125 units of λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and 1 mm Na3VO4, as indicated. Reactions were stopped with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Washed nuclear pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of nuclease reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2). Varying amounts of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington Biochemical) were added to the nuclear suspensions and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 900 μl of nuclease buffer supplemented with 5 mm EDTA to inhibit further digestion. The nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 10 min, and the pellet was extracted with nuclear extraction buffer to release the remaining hRad9. The clarified supernatants and nuclear extracts were then immunoprecipitated with anti-hRad9 antisera followed by SDS-PAGE separation and immunoblotting. Intact and permeabilized cells were spun onto glass slides. Intact cells were fixed in 3.2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 23 °C. Permeabilized cells were fixed in 3.2% paraformaldehyde in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Fixed cells were then treated with buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm sucrose) for 5 min, washed twice with PBS, and blocked for 1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Cells were incubated overnight with affinity-purified hRad9 antibodies and washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Immune complexes were then stained with fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies. The DNA was counterstained with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 5 min. Stained cells were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Genetic studies in yeasts indicate that Rad9 functions early in a DNA damage-response pathway (5Lowndes N.F. Murguia J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 6Caspari T. Carr A.M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Such a proximal function suggests that Rad9 might reside in the nucleus. To assess this possibility, we examined the cellular location of hRad9 by indirect immunofluorescence. K562 myeloid leukemia cells were stained with affinity-purified anti-hRad9 polyclonal antibodies that recognize a single band of hRad9 in whole cell lysates (Fig.1 B). The cells were then counterstained with the DNA binding dye Hoechst to visualize the nucleus. Confocal microscopy revealed that hRad9 was distributed throughout the nucleus (Fig. 1 A). In agreement with this, hRad9 was also confined to the nucleus in 293 and A549 cells (data not shown). Next, we considered the possibility that DNA damage might affect the cellular localization of hRad9. After treatment with the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea or 50 Gy of ionizing γ-radiation (IR), cells were fixed and examined. Neither hydroxyurea nor IR altered hRad9 distribution after 1 (Fig. 1 A) or 8 h (data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate that hRad9 is a nuclear protein and suggest that DNA damage does not regulate the cellular localization of hRad9. To further analyze the cellular localization of hRad9, we permeabilized control, irradiated K562 cells, and separated the lysed cells by differential centrifugation into nuclei-, mitochondria-, and lysosome/microsome-enriched fractions as well as a soluble S100 fraction that contained the cytosolic contents. Surprisingly, in control cells, hRad9 was not associated with the nuclei or other particulate fractions (Fig. 2). Rather, hRad9 was released from the nuclei into the soluble fraction, suggesting that cell permeabilization readily extracted hRad9 from its normal nuclear location. In marked contrast, 1 h after irradiation, a significant fraction of hRad9 was retained in the nuclei. However, hRad9 was not found in any other particulate fraction up to 3 h after DNA damage. Taken together, these results indicate that hRad9 associates with nuclei but not other subcellular structures after DNA damage. Because DNA damage altered the association of hRad9 with the nuclear compartment, we further characterized this phenomenon. In Fig. 2, hRad9 was released from nuclei by denaturing and solubilizing proteins in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Thus, we asked whether we could recover nuclei-retained hRad9 by high salt extraction in a form suitable for additional biochemical analysis. Control and irradiated (50 Gy) K562 cells were first permeabilized in a digitonin-containing low salt buffer. The permeabilized cells were centrifuged to generate a pellet, which contained the nuclei, and a soluble low salt extract (Fig.3A, LS extract). The nuclei were washed with the low-salt buffer, and the wash was collected (Fig. 3, wash). The nuclear pellet was extracted with a high salt nuclear extraction buffer (conductivity equivalent to a 250 mm NaCl solution) to release a subset of nuclear proteins (Fig 3, high salt (HS) extract), and the insoluble nuclear remains were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Nuclear remnant). We then analyzed cell-equivalent volumes of the low salt extract, the nuclear wash, the high salt nuclear extract, and the solubilized nuclear remains for hRad9. hRad9 was released from control cell nuclei by low salt extraction. In contrast, however, a substantial amount of hRad9 was extracted from the particulate fraction of irradiated cells with the high salt extraction buffer. Quantitation of the immunoblot demonstrated that 1 h after irradiation (50 Gy), approximately 30% of the hRad9 pool accumulated within the extraction-resistant fraction. This fraction was stably bound to the nuclei (Fig. 3 A), as washing the nuclei with permeabilization buffer (wash) released little additional hRad9. Because no additional hRad9 was recovered when the nuclei were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, the nuclear extraction buffer quantitatively removed hRad9. Collectively, these results demonstrate that DNA damage converts a portion of the cellular hRad9 into a less extractable nuclear form that could then be recovered by high salt extraction. We then explored the dose of IR required to convert hRad9 into the extraction-resistant nuclear form. K562 cells and 293 cells were irradiated with the indicated doses, permeabilized, and extracted 1 h later (Fig. 3 B). hRad9 was converted into the less extractable form after a 5-Gy dose in both cell lines, and it was retained in greater amounts, proportional to dose, up to at least 50 Gy. Thus, these results indicate that DNA damage-inducible conversion of hRad9 to a less extractable form occurs in response to modest doses of γ-radiation. We also observed DNA damage-induced conversion of hRad9 to extraction-resistant complexes in human non-small lung carcinoma A549 cells and normal lymphoblasts (Fig. 3). Additionally, SV40-transformed GM847 fibroblasts, Jurkat T cells, and HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells also retained hRad9 in the nucleus after DNA damage (data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate that this DNA damage-inducible event occurs in numerous immortal and transformed epithelial, fibroblast, and hemopoietic human cell lines. To determine whether other nuclear proteins were also converted to less extractable forms after DNA damage, we examined three other checkpoint proteins and, as a control, the transcription factor CREB-1. When control cells were permeabilized, hHus1 and hRad1, the binding partners for hRad9 (37St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 38Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar), were found predominantly in the released extract (Fig. 4). However, after irradiation, hHus1 was also converted to a less extractable form with a similar time course. Similarly, a slower migrating, anti-hRad1-reactive band was also rapidly retained after DNA damage, suggesting that IR induces a post-translational modification of this checkpoint protein (see Fig.7). We also examined the nuclear checkpoint protein hRad17, which, like hRad9, also leaked out of the nuclei in permeabilized cells. However, unlike hRad9, hRad17 was not inducibly retained by DNA damage. As predicted for a nuclear transcription factor, CREB-1 remained associated with the nuclear pellet after cell permeabilization, and the protein was extracted in the high salt nuclear extraction buffer. Taken together, these results indicate that hRad9, along with its binding partners hHus1 and hRad1 is rapidly and selectively converted to a less extractable nuclear form after irradiation.Figure 7Nuclei-retained hRad9 is associated with hHus1 and phospho-hRad1. Control (−) and irradiated (50 Gy) K562 cells were cultured for 1 h. Cells were then permeabilized, and low (LS) and high salt (HS) nuclear extracts were prepared. A, hRad1 immunoprecipitates (IP) were immunoblotted (IB) with hRad1 (left panel) or hRad9 (right panel). hRad9 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with hRad1 (center panel). B, hHus1 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with hHus1 (left panel) or hRad9 (right panel). hRad9 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with hHus1 (center panel). C, control and irradiated (50 Gy) K562 cells were harvested 1 h later. High salt extracts were prepared, and hRad1 was immunoprecipitated. One set of parallel hRad1 immunoprecipitates was treated with 125 units of λ-protein phosphatase (λPPase), and another set was treated with λ-protein phosphatase and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (VO4). Immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted for hRad1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 suggested that extraction-resistant hRad9 might be localized within the nucleus. To demonstrate this directly, we treated K562 cells with IR and the DNA-damaging agent 4-NQO, which also potently converts hRad9 to a less extractable form (see Fig. 8). However, before staining for hRad9, we permeabilized cells to extract the non-bound pool of hRad9. The permeabilized cells were then stained for hRad9 (Fig.5). In agreement with the biochemical fractionation studies, hRad9 was lost from the nuclei of cells that had not been treated with DNA-damaging agents. In contrast, in cells treated with 50 Gy of IR or 4-NQO 1 h before permeabilization, hRad9 was retained in extraction-resistant foci. Taken together, these results suggest that hRad9 is loosely tethered and readily extracted from the nucleus by permeabilization in cells not treated with DNA-damaging agents. Upon DNA damage, extraction-resistant hRad9 complexes assemble in discrete foci that require increased ionic strength to disrupt.Figure 5DNA damage triggers formation of discrete nuclear foci. K562 cells were treated with diluent, 50 Gy of IR, or 2 μg/ml 4-NQO. One hour later cells were permeabilized, immobilized on glass microscope slides, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and stained with affinity-purified hRad9. Washed slides were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody, and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Images were visualized with a confocal laser-scanning microscope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The conversion of hRad9 into less-extractable forms might represent DNA damage-inducible hRad9 association with DNA or chromatin. To address this question, we tested whether nucleases could detach extraction-resistant hRad9 from nuclei that were isolated from irradiated cells. Results of this analysis revealed that micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 6) and DNase I (data not shown) released hRad9 from the nuclei. The nuclease susceptibility of nuclei-retained hRad9 suggests that hRad9 associates with DNA, either directly or indirectly, after DNA damage. Results in Fig. 3 showed that hRad9, hHus1, and modified hRad1 were all retained in K562 cell nuclei after irradiation. In view of the data that hRad9 interacted with hRad1 and hHus1 (37St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 38Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we asked whether retained hRad9 also interacted with hRad1 and hHus1. One hour after irradiation, K562 cells were permeabilized and fractionated. hRad9 was immunoprecipitated from the low and high salt extracts, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for hHus1 and hRad1. Figs.7, A and B, show that hRad9 extracted by the low and high salt extraction buffers was associated with hHus1 and hRad1. Interestingly, nuclei-bound hRad9 associated with a slower migrating form of hRad1, which resembled the slower migrating form of hRad1 that was retained in the nucleus after DNA damage (Fig. 4). To assess the possibility that the hRad9-associated hRad1 represented phosphorylated hRad1, hRad9 immunoprecipitates were treated with λ-protein phosphatase. Immunoblotting revealed that the phosphatase converted the slower migrating form of hRad1 to a form that exhibited mobility identical to that of unmodified hRad1 (Fig. 7 C). This demonstrates that, like hRad9, hRad1 is inducibly phosphorylated following DNA damage. Additionally, phospho-hRad1 is significantly enriched in the less extractable hRad1 nuclear fraction. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the hRad9·hHus1·hRad1 checkpoint complex is converted to an extraction-resistant nuclear aggregate by DNA damage. Even 24 h after irradiation of K562 cells with 50 Gy of IR the cells were not morphologically apoptotic nor had they activated caspases (data not shown), suggesting that conversion of hRad9 to the extraction-resistant form was not an apoptotic response. To further test this possibility, we assessed hRad9 nuclear retention in cells treated with drugs that are cytotoxic but do not directly damage DNA. Cells were irradiated or treated with the microtubule disrupter paclitaxel and the Cdk inhibitor flavopiridol for 1 and 24 h using drug concentrations that reduce clonogenicity of K562 cells by more than 95 percent (data not shown). In contrast to IR, which transformed hRad9 into a less extractable form that persisted even 24 h later (Fig.8 A), a 1-h exposure to flavopiridol did not elicit nuclear association. Even at 24 h, when cells were morphologically apoptotic, hRad9 was not retained in nuclei. Likewise, paclitaxel did not stimulate hRad9 nuclear retention after 1 or 24 h of drug exposure. Therefore, these results demonstrate that the increased association of hRad9 with nuclei requires DNA damage and does not occur in response to other non-DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents. Ionizing radiation generates a variety of DNA lesions including large numbers of DNA strand breaks and oxidatively damaged bases. To address whether other DNA lesions might trigger nuclear retention, we treated K562 cells with a panel of DNA-damaging agents for 2 h (Fig. 8 B). hRad9 was strongly retained after treatment with 4-NQO, which generates bulky base adducts and single-strand DNA breaks. The topoisomerase II poison etoposide (VP-16) and the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin, which trap their target enzymes in covalent complexes with DNA and create double-strand breaks when adjacent replication or transcription complexes collide with these covalent complexes, induced potent hRad9 nuclear retention. Hydoxyurea, which inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and causes nucleotide depletion, thereby stalling replication forks on the DNA, also provoked nuclear retention. Collectively, these results suggest that diverse types of DNA damage convert hRad9 to a less extractable nuclear complex. Although genetically identified as key components of the checkpoint response in S. pombe, the biochemical functions of Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 are not understood. Moreover, the subcellular localization of hRad9 is currently under debate. Our data as well as the data of St. Onge et al. (37St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrate that endogenous hRad9 is a nuclear protein. In contrast, however, Komatsu et al. (44Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) report that transiently expressed, epitope-tagged hRad9 is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This group also demonstrates that transiently expressed hRad9 exited the nucleus after DNA damage and redistributed to the mitochondria, where it interacted with Bcl-2 and promoted apoptosis. In the present study we found no evidence for extranuclear hRad9 after DNA damage when staining intact K562 or other cells. Also, we did not detect Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Mcl-1 in anti-hRad9 immunoprecipitates nor could we detect hRad9 in Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Mcl-1 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear but they may relate to the differential behavior of endogenous and transiently expressed, epitope-tagged hRad9. Alternatively, based on genetic and biochemical analyses, several models have proposed that Rad9 complex members are part of a surveillance mechanism that scans the genome for DNA damage. The data presented here expand upon and support such a model. First, hRad9 is a nuclear protein that is readily extracted from control cells, suggesting that it interacts only weakly with DNA. Second, after DNA damage, the hRad9 complex rapidly acquires new interactions, anchoring the complex to DNA. Given that Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 have been proposed to structurally resemble PCNA-like clamps (39Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M.

Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that conversion of the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex to the less extractable form may reflect the loading of this clamp-containing complex onto sites of DNA damage. Once loaded, the checkpoint protein clamp may anchor DNA-processing proteins and other checkpoint proteins that activate the DNA damage-signaling pathway in mammalian cells. Because DNA damage converted the hRad9 complex to a less extractable form in numerous cell lines, this might be an event that occurs in all human cells after DNA damage. However, such a conclusion awaits further study.

In the past two decades calmodulin participation in gating has been suggested, but compelling evidence for it has been lacking. Here we show that calmodulin indeed is associated with gap junctions and plays a direct role in chemical gating. Expression of a calmodulin mutant with the N-terminal EF hand pair replaced by a copy of the C-terminal pair dramatically increases the chemical gating sensitivity of gap junction channels composed of connexin 32 and decreases their sensitivity to transjunctional voltage. The increased chemical gating sensitivity, most likely because of the higher overall Ca2+ binding affinity of this mutant as compared with native calmodulin, and the decreased voltage sensitivity are only observed when the mutant is expressed before connexin 32. This indicates that the mutant, and by extension native calmodulin, must interact with connexin 32 before gap junctions are formed. Immunofluorescence data suggest further that this interaction leads to incorporation of native or mutant calmodulin into the connexon as an integral regulatory subunit.

(ed) (2000) in Current Topics in Membranes, Vol. 49, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar). As channels close, cells uncouple from each other electrically and metabolically.

Two decades ago, evidence for the ability of a nonspecific calmodulin (CaM)1 antagonist (trifluoperazine) to prevent CO2-induced uncoupling ofXenopus embryonic cells suggested that CaM may participate in channel gating (19Peracchia C. Bernardini G. Peracchia L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91 (abstr.): 124Google Scholar, 20Peracchia C. Bernardini G. Peracchia L.L. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1983; 399: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was strengthened by evidence for CaM binding to connexin 32 (Cx32) in gel overlays (21Hertzberg E.L. Gilula N.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1981; 46: 639-645Crossref Google Scholar,22Van Eldik L.J. Hertzberg E.L. Berdan R.C. Gilula N.B. Biochem. Biophys. Residues Commun. 1985; 126: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Subsequently, more specific CaM blockers (calmidazolium and W7) were observed to prevented uncoupling in various cell types (23Peracchia C. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 81: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Peracchia C. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1987; 408: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, CaM participation in gap junction channel gating has also been suggested by evidence that inhibition of CaM expression eliminates CO2-induced gating (12Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Li L. Peracchia L.L. Pflügers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and by the demonstration that a fluorescent CaM derivative binds to Cx32 and Cx32 fragments in vitro (25Török K. Stauffer K. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view are also data from Cx32 mutants expressed heterotypically with Cx32wt in oocytes and tested in the presence and absence of CaM (26Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1361-C1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The behavior of these mutants demonstrated the function of a slow gate sensitive to both CO2 and transjunctional voltage (V j) and suggested that the chemical gate and the slow gate are the same, and likely to be a sizable negatively charged particle (2Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.L. Peracchia C. Current Topics in Membranes. 49. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 271-295Google Scholar, 26Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1361-C1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The slow kinetics of the chemical gate was demonstrated in single channel records (27Bukauskas F.F. Peracchia C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2137-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). With inhibition of CaM expression, slow gating and CO2-sensitive gating virtually disappeared (2Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.L. Peracchia C. Current Topics in Membranes. 49. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 271-295Google Scholar), suggesting CaM participation in this mechanism. To question more directly whether CaM participates in chemical gating, we have monitored the effects of expressed CaM mutants on chemical andV j gating of homotypic Cx32 channels and have investigated whether CaM is localized at gap junctions using immunofluorescence microscopy. Cx32 is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, and Cx32 mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of the X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth demyelinating disease (3Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 28Bergoffen J. Scherer S.S. Wang S. Scott M.O. Bone L.J. Paul D.L. Chen K. Lensch M.W. Chance P.F. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 1993; 262: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Two CaM mutants (29Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were used in this study: CaMCC and CaMNN. In CaMCC, the N-terminal EF hand pair (residues 9–75) is replaced by a duplication of the C-terminal pair (residues 82–148), whereas in CaMNN the C-terminal pair is replaced with the N-terminal pair. These CaM mutants were selected based on the fact that the two lobes exhibit considerable functional specialization. Because the Ca2+affinity constant of the C-terminal EF hand pair is almost 1 order of magnitude greater than that of the N-terminal pair (29Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we felt that at the very least the greater overall Ca2+ binding affinity of CaMCC might translate into significantly increased chemical gating sensitivity of gap junction channels. Oocytes were prepared as described previously (12Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Li L. Peracchia L.L. Pflügers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult female Xenopuslaevis frogs were anesthetized with 0.3% tricaine (MS-222), and the oocytes were surgically removed from the abdominal incision. The oocytes were placed in ND96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6 with NaOH). Oocytes at stage V or VI were subsequently defolliculated for 80 min at room temperature in 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) in a nominally calcium-free solution (OR2) containing 82.5 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6 with NaOH). Defolliculated oocytes were first injected with antisense oligonucleotide complementary to endogenous Xenopus Cx38 (26Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1361-C1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antisense oligonucleotide blocks completely the endogenous junctional communication. On the next day, the oocytes were injected at the vegetal pole with cRNA of CaM mutants, CaMCC, or CaMNN and incubated overnight at 18 °C. They were reinjected 24 h later with Cx32 cRNA, homotypically paired 7–24 h later, following mechanical stripping of their vitelline layer in a hypertonic medium and superfused at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min by a peristaltic pump (Rainin Instrument Co. Inc., Woburn, MA) with either ND96 or OR2 containing 180 μm BAPTA. Oocyte pairs were studied electrophysiologically 0.5–2 h after pairing using the standard double voltage clamp procedure for measuringG j (8Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V. Science. 1981; 211: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Following the insertion of a current and a voltage microelectrode in each oocyte, both oocytes were initially voltage clamped individually with two oocyte clamp amplifiers (OC-725C, Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) to the same holding potential,V m1 = V m2 (usually −20 mV), so that no junctional current would flow at rest (I j = 0). A V j gradient was created by imposing a +20 mV voltage step (V 1) of 2-s duration every 10 or 30 s to oocyte 1 while maintaining V 2 at V m , thus V j = V 1. The negative feedback current (I 2), injected by the clamp amplifier in oocyte 2 for maintaining V 2constant at V m, was used for calculatingG j, as it is identical in magnitude to the junctional current (I j), but of opposite sign (I j = −I 2);G j =I j/V j. Pulse generation and data acquisition were performed by means Clampex 8.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) and DigiData 1200 interface (Axon).I j and V j were measured with Clampfit 8.0 (Axon), and the data were plotted with SigmaPlot version 5.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). For studying voltage dependence of G j, each oocyte of the pair was first voltage clamped at −20 mV. Voltage steps of 20 mV (± 120 mV maximum) and 25-s duration were then applied every 45 s to either oocyte of the pair while maintaining the other at −20 mV. To illustrate the relationship between steady-stateG j (G j ss) andV j, the normalized G j(G j ss/G j max) was plotted with respect to V j. The curve was fitted to a two-state Boltzmann's distribution of the form: (G j ss −G j min)/(G j max −G j ss) = exp[−A(V j −V 0)], where V 0 is theV j value at which the voltage-sensitive conductance is one half the maximal value, andG j min is the theoretical minimum normalizedG j. A = ηq/kT is a constant expressing voltage sensitivity in terms of number of equivalent gating charges, η, moving through the entire applied field, where q is the electron charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, andT is the temperature (K). For monitoring changes in cytosolic Ca2+, oocytes were injected with a solution of Calcium Green-1 (C-3010, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) to reach a calculated intra-oocyte concentration of ∼100 μm. The oocytes were viewed 1–3 h later with a Nikon inverted microscope coupled to a Ca2+ imaging apparatus (InCyt ImTM, Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH), focusing on the bottom oocyte surface. Immunofluorescence labeling of CaM and Cx32 was performed on cultured HeLa cells transfected with Cx32 wild type. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature or with 100% methanol for 5 min at 4 °C. Coverslips with dried cells were permeabilized for 2 h in 0.1 mphosphate buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum (PBTGS). Between steps involving antibodies, the preparations were washed three times for 5 min each with PBTGS. The cells were double-labeled, and all the antibodies were diluted in PBTGS. The preparations were first incubated overnight with polyclonal primary antibody to CaM (1:100– 1:1000, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), followed by 1 h of incubation with a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Alexa488 (1:500, Molecular Probes Inc.). The cells were then incubated overnight with monoclonal primary antibody to Cx32 (1:100–1:1000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by 1 h of incubation with a secondary anti-mouse antibody coupled to Cy-3 (1:500, Accurate Inc., Westbury, NY). The preparations were allowed to air-dry and were mounted on slides using an anti-fade mounting medium. Cells were observed under a Nikon Microphot fluorescence microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu C4742–95 cooled CCD video camera. Images were collected in a laboratory computer using Image-pro (Meyer Instruments, Inc, Houston, TX). In oocytes expressing CaMCC, the initialG j, measured 0.5–2 h after pairing, is very low (G j = 0.08 ± 0.1 μS,n = 21) compared with controls (homotypic Cx32 channels without CaMCC; G j = 5.44 ± 4.9 μS,n = 43), because most channels are in closed state. Indeed, G j increases to 0.85 ± 0.8 μS (n = 21) when [Ca2+] i , monitored with Calcium Green-1, is lowered by superfusing the oocytes with 180 μm BAPTA in nominally calcium-free solutions (Fig.1 A). With return to normal external saline, G j drops rapidly at first and then very slowly, remaining at higher than initial values for long periods of time (Fig. 1 A), presumably because the oocytes are still depleted in Ca2+. Superfusion with nominally calcium-free solutions with a lower BAPTA concentration (90 μm) are significantly less effective (Fig.1 B). This suggests that CaMCC drastically increases the sensitivity of the chemical gate, such that the cell-cell channels are closed even at resting [Ca2+] i while they are normally observed to be open. The increase in chemical gating sensitivity associated with expression of CaMCC was further confirmed by testing the effects of CO2 in normal saline solutions several minutes after the BAPTA superfusion. We have previously shown that exposure to CO2 increases both [H+] i and [Ca2+] i , but G j correlates more closely with the latter, suggesting that Ca2+ mediates the effect of lowered pHi (9Peracchia C. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 75-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Peracchia C. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 117: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Lazrak A. Peracchia C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2002-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Li L. Peracchia L.L. Pflügers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). With 3 min of superfusion of normal saline gassed with 100% CO2,G j rapidly drops to 0 (Fig. 1 C), whereas in control experiments (Fig. 1 C) it decreases only by 15 ± 5% (n = 7). After CO2washout, the channels remain closed for a long time but readily reopen with superfusion of 180 μm BAPTA in nominally calcium-free solutions (Fig. 1 C). Significantly, the effect of CaMCC on gating is only observed when CaMCC is expressed before Cx32. Expression of Cx32 before CaMCC (Fig. 1 D) or coexpression of CaMCC and Cx32 (data not shown) has no appreciable effect on gating sensitivity. No effect is also observed with expression of CaMNN (Fig. 1 D) or overexpression of CaM (data not shown). These results suggest that CaMCC, and by extension native CaM, must be associated with Cx32 before it is assembled in the connexon. The simplest interpretation is that CaM is an integral, regulatory subunit of the connexon. An intimate relationship between CaMCC and Cx32 is also suggested by the significant effect of CaMCC on V j-gating sensitivity. Fig. 2 (A andB) presents a comparison of junctional currents (I j) generated by subjecting oocyte pairs to families of 20 mV V j steps (± 120 mV maximum, 25-s duration). In controls, Cx32 channels demonstrate a typicalV j sensitivity, characterized by drastic, exponential, I j decay with time forV js > ± 40 mV (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, when CaMCC is expressed before Cx32, the channels show a significantly decreased V j sensitivity, characterized by a reduction of I j decay rate for V j values of more than ±40 mV (Fig.2 B). Significantly, expression of CaMCC after Cx32 does not affect V j sensitivity (Fig. 2 C). The effect of CaMCC is readily demonstrated by plotting the relationship between normalized G j(G j ss/G j max) andV j, and fitting control and CaMCC data to a two-state Boltzmann's distribution (Fig. 2 D). The Boltzmann values show that expression of CaMCC before Cx32 drastically decreasesV j sensitivity. G j drops only by ∼40% with V j as high as ±120 mV, and the number of equivalent gating charges (η) moving through the applied field is halved (Fig. 2 D). These data suggest that CaM must be closely associated with Cx32 channels, becauseV j gating is an inherent property of the connexin. A close association between CaM and Cx32 is further demonstrated by immunofluorescence data from cultured HeLa cells expressing Cx32 (Fig.3). Cells were fixed with formaldehyde or methanol, permeabilized with Triton X-100, sequentially exposed to monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to Cx32 and CaM, and stained with anti-IgG antibodies tagged with two different fluorescent dyes. This procedure results in loss of soluble CaM, hence the lack of nuclear staining (Fig. 3). The immunofluorescence labeling shows that Cx32 and CaM colocalize in punctated or linear areas of cell-cell contact (Fig.3), indicating a close spatial relationship between CaM and Cx32 gap junctions. Localization of fluorescent label at junctional sites is also observed in cells exposed to CaM antibodies alone (data not shown). Altogether these data indicate that CaM is intimately associated with connexin channels and participates as a regulatory subunit in channel gating. The drastic increase in chemical gating sensitivity of Cx32 channels containing CaMCC may be explained by the higher overall Ca2+ binding affinity of CaMCC, when compared with native CaM (29Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Potential CaM binding sites have been identified in Cx32 (30Peracchia C. Hertzberg E.L. Johnson R.G. Gap Junctions. y. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 267-282Google Scholar): one at the N terminus (residues 15–32) and the other at the base of the C terminus (residues 209–221). However, mutation of basic residues to neutral or acidic residues at the C-terminal site, which should inhibit CaM binding, paradoxically resulted in increased chemical gating sensitivity (26Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1361-C1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang X.G. Peracchia C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 798-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Wang X.G. Peracchia C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 44: C1384-C1390Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal, rather than C-terminal, domain of Cx32 is likely to contain the CaM binding site. Significantly, the sequence of the N-terminal CaM-binding site is highly conserved among connexins and contains the binding motif identified in a class of CaM-dependent proteins that include CaM kinases I and II, MARCKS protein, synapsin, and the heat shock 84-kDa protein (reviewed in Ref. 33Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). With an increase in [Ca2+] i , CaM may physically block the channel (cork gating; Ref. 2Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.L. Peracchia C. Current Topics in Membranes. 49. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 271-295Google Scholar) or close the channel via conformational changes in Cx32. CaM and the cytoplasmic mouth of the connexon have opposite charge characteristics, and both channel mouth and CaM lobes are ∼25 Å in diameter (2Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.L. Peracchia C. Current Topics in Membranes. 49. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 271-295Google Scholar); thus, if CaM were gating by obstructing the channel, a CaM lobe would fit in the channel mouth. Localization of CaM at the N terminus (residues 15–32) would place it in a strategic position for gating, because substituted cysteine accessibility method data suggest that the next two residues (Ile33 and Met34) are within the cytoplasmic mouth of the channel (34Zhou X.W.

Kasperek E Nicholson B.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 22Google Scholar). It is now becoming apparent that CaM regulates the activities of a number of channel functions. The presence of CaM binding sites and/or the direct CaM participation in channel mechanisms have been reported for Ca2+-activated Na+ and K+channels of Paramecium, the transient receptor potential like nonspecific Ca2+ channel of Drosophila melanogaster, the ryanodine receptor, the small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel, the calcium-dependent K+ channel, thel-type calcium channel, the P/Q-type calcium channel, and the voltage-dependent Na+ channel (36Levitan I.B.

In conclusion, the data we have presented indicate that CaM is involved in chemical gating of gap junction channels made of Cx32 through a direct interaction with the connexin. The evidence includes the drastic increase in chemical gating sensitivity that is observed when the CaM mutant CaMCC is expressed before, but not after, Cx32, the effect of expressed CaMCC on transjunctional voltage gating, and the colocalization of CaM and Cx32 at junctional contacts. We are indebted to Drs. Peter Shrager and Katie Kazarinova Noyes for help with the immunofluorescence technique and for making available their fluorescence equipment."

It has been hypothesized that these mutations cause COMP to misfold and to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, this hypothesis is not supported by previous reports that COMP, when purified in the presence of EDTA, shows no obvious difference in electron microscopic appearance in the presence or absence of calcium ions. Since this discrepancy may be due to the removal of calcium during purification, we have expressed wild-type COMP and the most common mutant form found in pseudoachondroplasia, MUT3, using a mammalian expression system and have purified both proteins in the presence of calcium. Both proteins are expressed as pentamers. Direct calcium binding experiments demonstrate that wild-type COMP, when purified in the presence of calcium, is a calcium-binding protein. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy and limited trypsin digestion at various calcium concentrations show that there are conformational changes associated with calcium binding to COMP. Whereas COMP exists in a more compact conformation in the presence of calcium, it shows a more extended conformation when calcium is removed. MUT3, with a single aspartic acid deletion in the type 3 repeats, binds less calcium and presents an intermediate conformation between the calcium-replete and calcium-depleted forms of COMP. In conclusion, we show that a single mutation in the type 3 repeats of COMP causes the mutant protein to misfold. Our data demonstrate the importance of calcium binding to the structure of COMP and provide a plausible explanation for the observation that mutations in the type 3 repeats and COOH-terminal globular region lead to pseudoachondroplasia.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is unclear how these mutations affect COMP and why mutations in COMP lead to the intracellular retention of various proteins and the disease phenotype. The large number of consecutive calcium-binding consensus repeats is unique to TSPs. The aspartate-rich sequences are similar to sequences in calcium-binding sites of a class of calcium-binding proteins including calmodulin, parvalbumin, and fibrinogen (23Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Variations of the calcium-binding consensus sequence DXDXDGXXDXXDXoccur 13 times in a TSP subunit and have been proposed to form calcium-binding loops (23Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 24Sun X. Skorstengaard K. Mosher D.F. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1729-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dialysis, circular dichroism, and limited trypsin digestion studies on TSP1 suggest that each TSP1 subunit binds 11–12 calcium ions in a cooperative fashion. Most of the calcium-binding activity can be attributed to the type 3 repeats. These studies also suggest that there is a conformational change when TSP1 binds calcium (25Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1729-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12098-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The type 3 repeats are highly conserved in all TSP family members. According to the presence of the type 3 repeats in COMP (see Fig. 1) and studies on TSP1, COMP is predicted to bind calcium and to display different conformations in the presence and absence of calcium. However, in all previous reports, COMP, originally purified in the presence of EDTA, failed to show a significant conformational difference as a function of calcium (27Hauser N. Paulsson M. Kale A.A. DiCesare P.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 223: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), therefore casting doubt on whether COMP itself is a calcium-binding protein. It has been hypothesized that mutations in the type 3 repeats of COMP result in the incorrect folding of the protein, which leads to the retention of the protein in the ER. However, previous results question why mutations in the calcium-binding repeats should lead to such significant disease phenotypes if the presence and absence of calcium in the molecule are not associated with any conformational differences. Therefore, in this study, we set out to reexamine the effect of calcium on the structure and function of COMP. To preserve possible calcium-sensitive structures that might be perturbed by treatment with EDTA as in previous purification methods, we chose not to study COMP or MUT3 purified from natural sources. Instead, we have expressed human COMP and MUT3 and purified them from conditioned media in the presence of calcium. We show that COMP, when purified in the presence of calcium, is a calcium-binding protein. COMP also displays different conformations as a function of calcium concentration. In addition, we demonstrate that the most common mutation found in PSACH, MUT3, a single amino acid deletion, is sufficient to cause the mutant protein to bind less calcium and to perturb the structure. These results are contrary to all previously published studies, which have not detected any effect of calcium on COMP conformation using COMP purified in the presence of EDTA (27Hauser N. Paulsson M. Kale A.A. DiCesare P.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Our results argue for the importance of the type 3 calcium-binding repeats of COMP and serve as a basis for comprehending the mechanisms of mutations in this region leading to PSACH and EDM1. The typical PSACH mutation, MUT3, was previously identified in patient P303 from family P300F (9Hecht J.T. Nelson L.D. Crowder E. Wang Y. Elder F.F.B. Harrison W.R. Francomano C.A. Prange C.K. Lennon G.G. Deere M. Lawler J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). MUT3 has a 3-base pair GAC deletion in nucleotides 1430–1444, resulting in a single aspartate deletion in the five aspartate residues in the tenth and eleventh calcium-binding loops (Fig.1). It is the most common mutation, accounting for 30% of the PSACH cases (9Hecht J.T. Nelson L.D. Crowder E. Wang Y. Elder F.F.B. Harrison W.R. Francomano C.A. Prange C.K. Lennon G.G. Deere M. Lawler J.

Genet. 1998; 80: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from patient lymphocytes, and cDNA was transcribed using the Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA sample was amplified following standard procedures using primers L6F (5′-TGGAGACGGACATCAGGACT-3′) and L4R (5′-CTCGGCCACAGCACGGAAGG-3′). The 580-base pair product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Clones were screened for the deletion by polymerase chain reaction amplification with primers L6F and L6R (9Hecht J.T. Nelson L.D. Crowder E. Wang Y. Elder F.F.B. Harrison W.R. Francomano C.A. Prange C.K. Lennon G.G. Deere M. Lawler J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Clone 5 contains the deletion. The full-length COMP cDNA was cloned previously and sequenced (7Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lawler J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The BalI/StuI fragment of COMP was replaced with the mutant fragment from clone 5. The resulting clone, MUT3, was confirmed by sequence analysis with primers L6F and L4R using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. Full-length COMP and MUT3 sequences were cloned into pcDNA3.1+ vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting respective clones were transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Single colonies of stable transfectants were isolated under the selection of G418 and expanded. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum until nearly confluent. Cells were then washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2 mml-glutamine for 48 h. Conditioned media were collected for purification. To purify COMP or MUT3, conditioned media were precipitated by 30% ammonium sulfate at 4 °C overnight. Precipitates were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm CaCl2, loaded onto linear 10–20% sucrose gradients in TBS with 2 mm CaCl2, and separated by centrifugation in a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor at 38,000 rpm for 20–24 h. Fractions containing COMP or MUT3 were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis and pooled. Fractions were stored at −80 °C until further use. Purified COMP or MUT3 in buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 was diluted 1:5 with 70% glycerol and 0.15 m ammonium acetate containing 0.2 or 1 mm CaCl2 prior to spraying. The final calcium concentration in the samples was therefore either 0.56 or 1.2 mm. An equivalent sample of protein was adjusted to 5 mm EDTA prior to mixing with 70% glycerol and 0.15 m ammonium acetate prepared without CaCl2. The samples were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica and rotary-shadowed with platinum from an angle of 6° to the horizontal. A shadow thickness of ∼12 Å was used, and the replicas were coated with a 100-Å thick supporting carbon film from an angle of 90°. Replicas of COMP and MUT3 were observed with a transmission electron microscope, and their pictures were taken for further examination. Purified recombinant COMP or MUT3 was dialyzed against TBS containing either 2 or 0.5 mmCaCl2. EDTA was added to samples of each protein to achieve the desired final free Ca2+ concentrations. Trypsin digestion was carried out at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 for 20 h at 0 °C. Digestion was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer to the samples, followed by boiling of the samples and SDS-PAGE. Digestion was also performed in the presence of 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide. To sequence limited tryptic fragments, proteins with specific free Ca2+ concentrations were digested with trypsin, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to a piece of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Protein bands were visualized by brief Ponceau S staining and cut out. After extensive washing with deionized distilled water, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane strips with the tryptic bands were sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA) for amino acid analysis and NH2-terminal sequencing. Calcium binding to COMP and MUT3 at 0.3 and 1.2 mm free calcium was measured. For binding at 0.3 mm CaCl2, COMP and MUT3 were purified as described above, except that all solutions contained 0.3 instead of 2 mm CaCl2. All glassware was soaked in deionized distilled water before use. COMP and MUT3 (100 μl each), purified in the presence of either 0.3 or 2 mmCaCl2, along with 100 μl of TSP1, were dialyzed in Slide-A-Lyzer mini-dialysis units (Pierce) against 9.7 ml of dialysis buffer for 24 h at 4 °C. The dialysis buffer contained 140 mm NaCl, 17% sucrose, 0.3 or 1.2 mmCaCl2, and 10 μCi/ml 45CaCl2 (NEN Life Science Products). At the end of dialysis, four 10-μl samples of each protein and dialysis buffer were taken out for scintillation counting, and four 10-μl samples for protein determination using Bio-Rad protein assays. COMP, reduced by 5 mmdithiothreitol, was sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. An average molecular weight of 84.8 × 103/monomeric subunit was obtained and was used for calcium-binding calculation with COMP and MUT3. A molecular weight of 150 × 103/subunit was used for the TSP1 calculation. When human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with full-length COMP or MUT3 DNA, they were able to process and secrete both proteins. The purification procedure produced 2.8 ± 2.1 μg of purified COMP and 1.5 ± 0.9 μg of purified MUT3 per ml of serum-free conditioned medium (mean ± S.D. from >10 purification procedures). Untransfected 293 cells did not synthesize any endogenous COMP as judged by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody (F8) against COMP (22Hecht J.T. Deere M. Putnam E. Cole W. Vetel B. Chen H. Lawler J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The two purified proteins migrated with equivalent molecular sizes when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig.2). The purified proteins also comigrated in SDS-PAGE with COMP that was expressed by human cartilage and tendon (data not shown). Although COMP and MUT3 appeared to have the same molecular weight in SDS-PAGE, differences became apparent during purification. When COMP and MUT3 were subjected to sedimentation through linear 10–20% sucrose gradients in the presence of 2 mmCaCl2, the peak of COMP appeared in earlier fractions from the gradient than that of MUT3 (Fig. 3). This suggests that although COMP and MUT3 have almost the same molecular mass, their structures, as reflected in their sedimentation, are different. The rotary shadowing EM images, in which both COMP and MUT3 were visualized as pentamers (Fig. 4), suggested that mutations in the type 3 repeat region did not affect the subunit assembly. This conclusion was consistent with the observation that COMP and MUT3 comigrated in the absence of reducing agent in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). In the presence of calcium, COMP had a compact appearance that made it difficult to resolve the five subunits. In the presence of EDTA, COMP adopted an extended conformation (Fig. 4). The uncorrected lengths of the arms of COMP from the interchain disulfides to the end of the C-globe were 30.4 ± 3.3 nm in the presence of EDTA, 19.9 ± 2.6 nm in the presence of 0.56 mmcalcium, and 19.3 ± 4.8 nm in the presence of 1.2 mmcalcium (mean ± S.D. of 20 measurements each). These results suggested that COMP, when purified in a calcium-replete form, will undergo conformational changes when calcium is chelated from the molecules. This observation differs from previously published reports on COMP purified in the presence of EDTA (28Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Mann K. Paulsson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the conformational change we observed was consistent with previous findings on TSP1, TSP3, and TSP4 and with the presence of the highly homologous type 3 calcium-binding repeats in COMP (6Oldberg A.

Under EM, MUT3 appeared indistinguishable from COMP in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 4), with an arm length of 31.9 ± 4.4 nm. However, in the presence of calcium, MUT3 adopted an intermediate conformation between the calcium-replete and calcium-depleted forms of COMP, with arm lengths of 25.6 ± 3.8 and 25.5 ± 3.9 nm in the presence of 0.56 and 1.2 mm calcium, respectively. MUT3 was not as tightly folded as COMP in the calcium-replete form, whereas it was more compact than the calcium-depleted form (Fig. 4). To further probe the conformational differences between COMP and MUT3, we employed limited trypsin digestion of COMP and MUT3 under various calcium concentrations (Fig. 5). Five tryptic fragments with molecular masses of 27, 36, 50, 55, and 63 kDa under reducing conditions were observed in the digestion of both COMP and MUT3. Trypsin digestion of COMP generated one additional fragment of 67 kDa that was not present in the MUT3 digestion at the enzyme/substrate ratio employed. At low calcium concentrations (in the range of 1–25 μm), both COMP and MUT3 were readily cleaved by trypsin into two small fragments of 27 and 36 kDa (Fig. 5). When the calcium concentration was increased to the range of 50–100 μm, COMP was digested into intermediate bands of 50 and 55 kDa. When the calcium concentration was higher than 150 μm, with increasing calcium concentration, the 63- and 67-kDa bands of COMP started to appear. The 67-kDa band became the prevalent band at calcium concentrations in the millimolar range. With MUT3, the intermediate bands of 50 and 55 kDa started to appear at 50 μm Ca2+. However, these bands persisted in a much wider range of calcium concentrations (up to ∼500 μm) compared with COMP. The 63-kDa band was apparent only when the calcium concentrations were higher than 500 μm, and the 67-kDa band was not present even at the highest calcium concentration of 2 mm. Similar digestion patterns were observed in the presence or absence of 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide. A similar sequence of appearance of the fragments was observed with SDS-PAGE performed in the absence of reducing agent. These data demonstrate that COMP and MUT3 have different susceptibilities to trypsin digestion that are dependent on calcium concentrations and suggest that conformational differences related to the type 3 calcium-binding repeats are present. The relative quantity of the 27- and 63-kDa fragments of COMP and MUT3 was determined by densitometry scanning of the gels (Fig.6). The sigmoidal shape of these curves indicates that the binding of calcium to these proteins is cooperative (25Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1729-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12098-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For TSP1, the midpoint of these curves has been shown to be equivalent to the average binding constant determined by equilibrium dialysis (25Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1729-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12098-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast to equilibrium dialysis that measures total calcium binding to the intact molecule, limited trypsin digestion is able to detect localized conformational changes in the immediate environment of the cleavage site. For both COMP and MUT3, calcium ions appear to bind initially with an apparent affinity of ∼20 μm. By contrast, the calcium-binding sites that protect the cleavage sites that produce the 63-kDa fragment bind with average apparent affinity of ∼ 100 μm for wild-type COMP and ∼ 500 μm for MUT3.Figure 6Quantitative graphical representation of limited trypsin digestion. Limited trypsin digestions of COMP and MUT3 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described in the legend to Fig. 5. The gels were then scanned by a densitometer, and bands at 27 and 63 kDa were quantified. The relative density of the heaviest band at a specific molecular mass was set as 1. The relative density of each sample was plotted against the free calcium concentration during digestion. The calcium concentrations given were not corrected for calcium bound to COMP or MUT3.View Large"

To identify mAChR-inducible genes, we used a differential display approach and found that mAChRs rapidly induced transcription of the immediate early geneCYR61 in HEK 293 cells with a maximum expression after 1 h of receptor stimulation. CYR61 is a member of the emerging CCN gene family that includes CYR61/CEF10, CTGF/FISP-12, and NOV; these encode secretory growth regulatory proteins with distinct functions in cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and survival. We found thatCYR61, CTGF, and NOV were expressed throughout the human central nervous system. Stimulation of mAChRs induced CYR61 expression in primary neurons and rat brain where CYR61 mRNA was detected in cortical layers V and VI and in thalamic nuclei. In contrast, CTGF andNOV expression was not altered by mAChRs neither in neuronal tissue culture nor rat brain. Receptor subtype analyses demonstrated that m1 and m3 mAChR subtypes strongly inducedCYR61 expression, whereas m2 and m4 mAChRs had only subtle effects. Increased CYR61 expression was coupled to mAChRs by both protein kinase C and elevations of intracellular Ca2+. Our results establish that CYR61expression in mammalian brain is under the control of cholinergic neurotransmission; it may thus be involved in cholinergic regulation of synaptic plasticity.

To identify mAChR-inducible genes, we established a differential display screen of genes activated in response to mAChR stimulation with the acetylcholine analog carbachol. We identified the immediate early gene CYR61 that encodes an extracellular signaling molecule to be differentially regulated by mAChRs. CYR61 belongs to the emerging CCN gene family (CYR61/CEF10,CTGF/FISP-12, NOV, ELM-1,COP-1, and WISP-3) of secreted growth regulatory proteins that bind to components of the extracellular matrix and the cell surface (31Bork P.

We provide evidence that CYR61 and its family membersCTGF and NOV are expressed throughout the mammalian brain and that transcription of CYR61, but not that of CTGF and NOV, is under the control of mAChR signaling in primary cortical neurons and in mammalian brain. Wild type HEK 293 cells and 293 cells stably transfected with muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes m1, m2, m3, or m4 (13Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J.

Unstimulated cells, cultured in parallel from the same passages, were used as controls. Effective receptor stimulation and transduction responses were verified by measuring carbachol-induced β-amyloid precursor protein ectodomains released into the conditioned media as described (46Nitsch R.M. Slack B.E. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Science. 1992; 258: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Primary cell cultures from embryonic day 18 rat brains were prepared according to the protocol from Segal and Manor (47Segal M. Manor D. J. Physiol.

In brief, cerebral cortices were dissected in chilled Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and mechanically dissociated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette in small volumes of Hanks' balanced salt solution. Dissociated cells were suspended in 10% horse serum and minimal essential medium enriched with 0.6% glucose and were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 6-well plates, at a density of about 106 cells per well. After 3 h, plating media were replaced by minimal essential medium enriched with Earle's salts, 0.6% glucose, and Bottenstein's N2supplements. In order to block the proliferation of glial cells, 3–4 days after plating media were exchanged for growth media supplemented with 0.5 μm cytosin-β-arabinofuranoside HCl (AracC). Thereafter, growth media were exchanged once a week. After 9 days in culture, subconfluent layers of primary cells were subjected to drug treatments, followed by RNA preparation or measurements of phosphoinositide turnover (48Nitsch R.M. Deng M.

The content of glial cells was estimated by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein and compared with neuronal staining with an antibody against tau, and it revealed that consistently more than 70% of the cultured cells had a neuronal phenotype. Total RNA was prepared by using either the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) or Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was stored at −80 °C. The RNA preparations from fetal rat lung (P1), adult rat thyroid, spleen, and brain were treated with DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) together with RNasin (Promega) for 30 min, followed by phenol protein extraction, and ethanol precipitation. 0.2 μg of RNA preparation was transcribed to cDNA by using the SuperScriptTMII ReverseTranscriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with equal amounts of one base anchor primers HT11A (5′TGCCGAAGCTTTTTTTTTTTA3′), HT11C (5′TGCCGAAGCTTTTTTTTTTTC3′), and HT11G (5′TGCCGAAGCTTTTTTTTTTTG3′). The differential display approaches were performed as described in detail by von der Kammer et al. (49Von der Kammer H. Albrecht C. Mayhaus M. Hoffmann B. Stanke G. Nitsch R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). h-CYR61 was identified as a differentially expressed gene by using the random primer DD20 (5′TGCCGAAGCTTTGGTCAT3′) or DD32 (5′TGCCGAAGCTTGGAGCTT3′) together with the anchor primer HT11A (5′TGCCGAAGCTTTTTTTTTTTA3′). 5–10 μg of total RNA were separated in 1% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels, and the RNA was blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products)-labeled cDNA probes that were generated by using the Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were washed under high stringency conditions, and x-ray films were exposed for 1–72 h. To control for equal loading of RNA, the identical membranes were probed with a 700-bp cDNA fragment of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), or with a β-actin cDNA fragment (CLONTECH). HEK 293 m1 mAChR cells were stimulated with carbachol for 1 h, and poly(A+) mRNA was prepared from total RNA by using the Poly(A)TTract IV kit (Promega). cDNA synthesis from poly(A+) mRNA was performed following a modified ZAP-cDNA synthesis protocol (Stratagene), and cDNA cloning into λZAP Express vector arms as well as preparation of the cDNA library were done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). A library screen of 4 × 104 clones was performed with a radiolabeled human CYR61 cDNA probe following the ZAP Express protocol (Stratagene). We amplified a 1403-bp h-CYR61cDNA fragment by using cDNA from carbachol-stimulated (1 h) HEK 293 m1 mAChRs cells. The forward primer EMHF (5′CCAAAACGGGGAAAGTTTCCAGCC3′) derived from the partial human sequence A33210 (EMBL accession number Z50168) that showed homology to the 5′ end of murine cyr61. The reverse primer EMHR (5′TTCCAGTATTACATTTCCCCTCCC3′) was homolog to the 3′ end ofh-CYR61 identified by our differential display experiment. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and cloned into the SmaI restriction site of pBluescript KS (Stratagene). The cloned PCR product was sequenced, and a PstI/BamHI restriction fragment that contained 1403 bp was used as a probe both for screening a λZAP Express cDNA library and for probing Northern blots. Human cDNA clones of CTGF (h-CTGF) and NOV(NOVH) were obtained as expressed sequence tag from the Research Center of the German Genome Project at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin, Germany (RZPD) (50Lehrach H. Drmanac R. Hoheisel R. Larin J. Lennon Z. Monaco G. Nizetic A.P. Zehetner D. Poustka A. Davis K.E. Tilghman S.M. Genome Analysis. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 39-81Google Scholar). A 1678-bp EcoRI/XhoI fragment from humanCTGF clone (IMAGp998P101426), and a 1735-bpHindIIIINotI fragment from human NOVclone (IMAGp998J07280) were used to generate radioactive probes for hybridization. A 1266-bp r-CYR61 cDNA fragment and a 881-bp r-CTGF cDNA fragment were amplified by PCR using fetal rat lung cDNA as template together with the primer combinations rCYR61Ef (5′TCTGAAAGGGATCTGCAGAGCTCA3′) and rCYR61Er (5′GGCTTTCACTTGACCCAA CTAATC3′) or rCTGF1f (5′TGACTGCCCCTTCCCGAGAAGGGT3′) and rCTGF4r (5′CCTTAGTGTGCGTTCTGTCACTGT3′). A 947-bp NOVR cDNA fragment was amplified by using adult rat brain cDNA as template together with the forward primer NOVM1f (5′TCGATGGGGTCATTTACCGCAACG3′) and reverse primer NOVM4r (5′CATATCCTGAGCTTACCTTGATTC3′). All PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, cloned into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. A complete r-CYR61 cDNA sequence was identified by sequence analysis of overlapping cDNAs from different tissues. Rat lung and placenta cDNA libraries (numbers 614 and 618) obtained from the Research Center of the German Genome Project at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin (RZPD) (50Lehrach H. Drmanac R. Hoheisel R. Larin J. Lennon Z. Monaco G. Nizetic A.P. Zehetner D. Poustka A. Davis K.E. Tilghman S.M. Genome Analysis. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 39-81Google Scholar) were screened with a 1266-bp r-CYR61cDNA fragment following RZPD instructions. Two lung cDNA clones (p614K0171Q2 and p614O2448Q2) were identified that displayedr-CYR61 5′ end (nt 1–534) as well as one placenta cDNA clone p618K0827Q2 corresponding to 3′ end (nt 1016–1987). PCR products that included the missing region from nt 443–1088 were generated from rat lung, thyroid, and spleen cDNAs of two different animals by using the primers rCYR61Ef (5′TCTGAAAGGGATCTGCAGAGCTCA3′) and rCYR61R1 (5′GCATCCTGCATAAGTAAATCGGAC3′). Adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with the mAChR agonist pilocarpine (25 mg/kg; Sigma) or with the vehicle PBS as an injection control. Animal behavior was monitored until the animals were decaptured 75 min after drug application. Brains were rapidly dissected and frozen on dry ice. Rat CYR61 (nt 928–1523), r-CTGF (nt 644–1524), or NOVR (nt 224–1280) cDNA fragments were subcloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was digested by restriction enzymesBamHI or XhoI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and subjected to phenol protein extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linearized plasmid DNA was used as template to generate radiolabeled sense and antisense cRNA probes by using either T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) together with [α-35S]UTP (NEN Life Science Products), GTP, ATP, and CTP, dithiothreitol, and RNase Out (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 37 °C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by ProbeQuant G50 gel filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rat brains were cut on a Leica cryostat microtome in 16-μm slices, thawed on glass slides, and stored at −80 °C before use. The slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, acetylated, and prehybridized for 3 h at 55 °C with prehybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× hybridization salts, 5× Denhardt's, 0.2% SDS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene), 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) in a humidified chamber. Hybridization was performed for 18 h at 55 °C with radiolabeled cRNA probes (5000 cpm/μl) in prehybridization buffer containing 10% dextran sulfate. The slices were dehydrated, washed under non-stringent conditions in 4× SSC at room temperature, followed by RNase A treatment. Two stringent wash steps were performed in 2× SSC for 10 min at 55 °C. The slices were dehydrated, and a x-ray film (Kodak Biomax MR) was exposed for 3–14 days. Emulsion dips were prepared with NTB-2 photoemulsion (Kodak), exposed for 1–4 weeks, developed, and fixed. Sections were counterstained with Mayers Hämalaun (Merck) (51Hartmann D. Fehr S. Meyerhof W. Richter D. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By using a differential display screen of mRNAs expressed in response to stimulation of m1 mAChR expressing HEK 293 cells, we identified two redundant bands of 450 and 540 bp in length, which were absent in parallel fractions of unstimulated cells (data not shown). Either band contained cDNA corresponding to human CYR61(h-CYR61), a homolog of the murine growth factor-inducible immediate early gene cyr61 (33O′Brian T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To verify that mAChRs are coupled to the transcriptional activation of the h-CYR61gene, we compared RNA from m1 mAChR-expressing cells that were stimulated with carbachol for different incubation times with unstimulated m1 mAChR-expressing cells. Northern blot analysis showed no detectable levels of h-CYR61 mRNA in unstimulated cells; h-CYR61 signal increased 15 min after stimulation, attained a maximum within 50–60 min, and decreased to lower but higher than control levels until 240 min after stimulation (Fig.1 A). An increase ofh-CYR61 expression was also detectable in HEK 293 m1 cells that were treated with carbachol in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cylcoheximide (Fig. 1 B). We identified a humanCYR61 full-length cDNA clone by screening a λ ZAP Express cDNA library prepared from carbachol-stimulated m1 mAChR-expressing HEK 293 cells. By using a 1403-bp h-CYR61cDNA probe that was obtained by PCR with cDNA from carbachol-stimulated HEK 293 m1 mAChR cells, we found that 7 out of 40,000 clones were human homologues of the murine cyr61gene. The sequence of a 2021-bp human CYR61 clone encoding a complete open reading frame predicted a 381-amino acid protein. The sequence data of our h-CYR61 full-length clone were submitted to GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank (accession number Y12084), and they confirm the h-CYR61 sequence that was recently published by Jay et al. (52Jay P. Berge′-Lefranc J.L. Marsollier C. Méjean C. Tavioux S. Berta P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1753-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Three different types of cDNA sources were used to identify the complete rat CYR61 (r-CYR61) cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF218568). By screening a rat lung cDNA library offered by the Research Center of the German Genome Project (50Lehrach H. Drmanac R. Hoheisel R. Larin J. Lennon Z. Monaco G. Nizetic A.P. Zehetner D. Poustka A. Davis K.E. Tilghman S.M. Genome Analysis. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 39-81Google Scholar) with a 1266-bp r-CYR61 cDNA probe generated by PCR from fetal rat lung, two lung cDNA clones (p614K0171Q2 and p614O2448Q2) were obtained that contained the 5′ end of r-CYR61 (nt 1–534). PCR products that were generated from rat lung, thyroid, and spleen cDNA corresponded to nt 443–1088. Finally, a cDNA clone (p618K0827Q2) corresponding to the 3′ end of r-CYR61 (nt 1016–1987) was identified by screening a rat placenta cDNA library from RZPD. The consensus sequence of 1987-bp includes one open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 379 amino acids. The human and rat CYR61 protein sequences were 93% identical. Characteristic features of the predicted human and rat CYR61 proteins included N-terminal signal peptides, high content of conserved cysteines, and several domains that are typical for members of the CCN (CYR61/ CEF10, CTGF/FISP-12/, NOV, ELM-1, WISP-3 and COP-1) family (31Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 32Lau L.F. Lam S.C.-T. Exper. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) as follows: an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein domain, a von Willebrand factor type C motif for possible oligomerization, a thrombospondin-1 domain that can bind both soluble and extracellular matrix molecules, and a C-terminal domain for putative dimerization. CYR61 and its relatives CTGF andNOV were the first genes that were identified to be members of the CCN gene family (31Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Even though these genes are characterized in peripheral tissues, less is known about their function in brain. In order to demonstrate the expression of CYR61,CTGF, and NOV in human brain, we probed Northern blots of poly(A+) RNA from several regions of adult human brains with cDNA probes of these three family members and found all of them to be expressed throughout human brain (Fig.2). The strongest expression ofh-CYR61 occurred in spinal cord, frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, as well as in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. In addition to the expected message of 2.4 kilobase pairs we detected a 3.8-kilobase pair message that may represent a splice var"
https://openalex.org/W2057347731,"Members of the SNF2/SWI2 family, characterized with sequence motifs similar to those found in DNA and RNA helicases, play roles in various aspects of cellular fundamental processes such as transcriptional regulation, chromosome stability, nucleotide excision repair, and recombination. We have isolated a novel member of the human SNF2/SWI2 family, RAD54B, which is highly homologous to mammalian RAD54. The RAD54 gene is a member of the RAD52 epistasis group which is involved in the recombinational repair of DNA damage. Here we demonstrate that human Rad54B (hRad54B), like human Rad54 (hRad54), associates with human Rad51 (hRad51). Both hRad54B and hRad54 associate with hRad51 through their NH(2)-terminal domains, but there are differences in their ways of association with hRad51. In contrast to Rad54, whose association with Rad51 is induced by ionizing radiation, Rad54B associates with Rad51 constitutively in immunoprecipitation experiments. Also, the failure to detect the interaction between hRad54B and hRad51 in the yeast two-hybrid assay suggests that their interaction, unlike that between hRad54 and hRad51, may be indirect. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that hRad54B formed nuclear foci that colocalized with hRad51, hRad54, and BRCA1. These findings suggest that Rad54B may be functionally distinct from Rad54, although it may play an active role in recombination processes in concert with other members of the RAD52 epistasis group."
https://openalex.org/W1548348246,"Polarization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel to the apical plasma membrane in epithelial cells is critical for vectorial chloride transport. Previously, we reported that the C terminus of CFTR constitutes a PDZ-interacting domain that is required for CFTR polarization to the apical plasma membrane and interaction with the PDZ domain-containing protein EBP50 (NHERF). PDZ-interacting domains are typically composed of the C-terminal three to five amino acids, which in CFTR are QDTRL. Our goal was to identify the key amino acid(s) in the PDZ-interacting domain of CFTR with regard to its apical polarization, interaction with EBP50, and ability to mediate transepithelial chloride secretion. Point substitution of the C-terminal leucine (Leu at position 0) with alanine abrogated apical polarization of CFTR, interaction between CFTR and EBP50, efficient expression of CFTR in the apical membrane, and chloride secretion. Point substitution of the threonine (Thr at position −2) with alanine or valine had no effect on the apical polarization of CFTR, but reduced interaction between CFTR and EBP50, efficient expression of CFTR in the apical membrane as well as chloride secretion. By contrast, individual point substitution of the other C-terminal amino acids (Gln at position −4, Asp at position −3 and Arg at position −1) with alanine had no effect on measured parameters. We conclude that the PDZ-interacting domain, in particular the leucine (position 0) and threonine (position −2) residues, are required for the efficient, polarized expression of CFTR in the apical plasma membrane, interaction of CFTR with EBP50, and for the ability of CFTR to mediate chloride secretion. Mutations that delete the C terminus of CFTR may cause cystic fibrosis because CFTR is not polarized, complexed with EBP50, or efficiently expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells."

Each complex includes the common signal-transducing subunit gp130. OSM and LIF also recruit the signaling competent, but structurally distinct OSMRβ and LIFRα subunits, respectively. To test the hypothesis that the particularly prominent cell regulation by OSM is due to signals contributed by OSMRβ, we introduced stable expression of human or mouse OSMRβ in rat hepatoma cells which have endogenous receptors for IL-6 and LIF, but not OSM. Both mouse and human OSM engaged gp130 with their respective OSMRβ subunits, but only human OSM also acted through LIFR. Signaling by OSMRβ-containing receptors was characterized by highest activation of STAT5 and ERK, recruitment of the insulin receptor substrate and Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways, and induction of a characteristic pattern of acute phase proteins. Since LIF together with LIFRα appear to form a more stable complex with gp130 than OSM with gp130 and OSMRβ, co-activation of LIFR and OSMR resulted in a predominant LIF-like response.

Stromal cells in turn respond prominently by enhanced production of IL-6 and LIF (14Okamoto H. Yamamura M. Morita Y. Harada S. Makino H. Ota Z. Arthritis Rheumatism. 1997; 40: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). IL-6 and LIF enter into circulation and participate in the recruitment of the systemic inflammatory response that includes the acute phase reaction of the liver (1Gabay C. Kushner I. N. Engl. J.

These cytokine receptor complexes cooperate with a second, signal-transducing subunit to form a signaling-competent receptor unit (abbreviated as follows: IL-6R consisting of IL-6Rα-gp130; LIFR consisting of LIFRα-gp130; and OSMR (also defined as type II OSMR) consisting of gp130-OSMRβ (17Taga T.

Ligand-induced receptor subunit interaction results in trans- and autophosphorylation of Janus protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) that are associated with the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor subunits.

Hence, we predict that the OSMRβ subunits are particularly effective in signal transduction, accounting for the high level of OSM effects. It has not previously been possible to precisely compare the regulatory action of the key IL-6 cytokine receptors, IL6R, OSMR, and LIFR, and to specifically define the cell response as a function of OSMRβ expression since appropriate cell lines were not available.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3357-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Tanaka M. Hara T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Miyajima A. Blood. 1999; 93: 804-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) now make it possible to define OSMR-specific action. The amino acid sequence of mOSMRβ shows 55% identity to the hOSMRβ sequence. Furthermore, mOSMRβ appears to form a type II OSMR complex only with rodent OSM (31Lindberg R.A. Juan T.S. Welcher A.A. Sun Y. Cupples R. Guthrie B. Fletcher F.A. Mol. Cell.

To assess the function of OSMRβ-dependent receptor systems and distinguish between the activity of type I and II OSMR, we reconstituted OSMR in a clonal line of rat H-35 hepatoma (22Baumann H.

These cells have active IL-6R, IL-11R, and LIFR systems, but are deficient in the expression of OSMRβ. The present studies demonstrate that 1) OSMRβ subunit assists in recruitment of a broader spectrum of signaling pathways than achieved by gp130 activation alone, 2) the particularly prominent activation of STAT5 and ERK pathways by OSMR accounts in part for the OSM specific gene regulatory pattern, and 3) the OSM response is influenced by coactivation of the LIFR.

Cells used for analyzing signaling were maintained for 18–24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.

The OSMRβ-FLAG constructs were transferred as NotI fragments into the retroviral vector MINV (36Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Goldman S.J. Leonard J.P. Hawley T.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

From the primary cultures of transduced cells (which normally contain 100 to 10000 separate clones), 24 to 48 clones were picked, expanded, and subcloned. Subclonal lines were characterized for relative expression of OSMRβ by FLAG immunoblotting, ligand-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and induction of APPs. The remaining cells on the primary culture plates were maintained and classified as a pool of stably transduced H-35 cells (termed hOSMRβ-H-35 cell or mOSMRβ-H-35 cells). The following expression vectors have been described previously: human LIFRα with deleted cytoplasmic domain (LIFRαΔcyto) in pDC302 (27Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D.

DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with a total of 20 μg of DNA/ml, including 0.25 μg of pEGFP(N1) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) as internal transfection marker, 15 μg of CAT-reporter construct, 0.5–2 μg/ml expression vector for receptor, and the balance with empty vector. H-35 cell lines were transfected with FuGene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendation using a ratio of 6 μl of FuGene6 to 4 μg of DNA. Cell cultures were subdivided immediately after transfection, and 24 h later these cultures were treated for 24 h with serum-free medium containing the inducing factors. To inhibit gp130 function in HepG2 cells during cytokine treatment, the cells were maintained in the presence of activity neutralyzing monoclonal antibodies against human gp130 (“144,” Ref. 44Chevalier S. Clement C. Robledo O. Klein B Gascan H. Wijdenes H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 762: 482-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Prior to cell extraction, expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was visualized under a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope. A digitized image of GFP positive culture at × 40 magnification was taken by a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) and GFP fluorescence signal above background quantitated in the NIH Image program version 1.62. The integrated net pixel values relative to a constant view area were used as a measure for transfection efficiency. CAT activity in serially diluted cell extract was determined, normalized to the GFP signal for each culture, and expressed in relative CAT activity. To obtain enriched cultures of H-35 cells transfected with expression vectors for STAT5 isoforms, 24 h after transfection, GFP negative (served as controls) and GFP positive cells were selected by sterile fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described (45Wang Y. Ripperger J. Fey G.H. Samols D. Kordula T. Wetzler M. Van Etten R.A. Baumann H. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 682-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This approach yielded 0.5 to 1 × 106 GFP positive cells representing a 50% recovery of the original 5% transfected cells in the culture. The cells were plated into 24-well culture plates (2.5 × 105 cells per well). Following 24 h recovery, the cells were treated for an additional 24 h with cytokines in the presence of dexamethasone. Conditioned medium was used to measure the amounts of plasma proteins. Cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of STAT5 proteins. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (0.5 ml/10-cm2 cell monolayers). Lysate containing ∼2 mg of protein were diluted to 1 ml of RIPA buffer, precleared, and incubated for 2 h with specific antibodies to gp130, LIFR, SHC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SHP-2 (Up-State Biotechnology Inc.), FLAG (M2 antibody; Eastman Kodak Co.), phosphotyrosine (Py20; Transduction Laboratories, combined with 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), extracellular domain of hOSMR (Immunex; Ref. 46Buday L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with 50 μl (50% slurry in RIPA buffer) of protein G-conjugated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and boiled in SDS sample loading buffer. The immunoprecipitates or aliquots of whole cell lysates were separated on a 6–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and proteins transferred to protean membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Wherever possible, separation of replicate sample aliquots was preferred over sequential probing of the same membranes in order to circumvent antigen loss. Where separate antigens of different sizes were analyzed, the membrane was cut into horizontal sections containing the specific size categories of antigens. The membranes were reacted with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Cappel, West Chester, PA) in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% milk or 3% albumin. Results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL) according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To perform additional immunoreactions, membranes were treated for 30 min with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Total cellular RNA was extracted by the Trizol method (Life Technology, Grand Island, NY). Aliquots of 5–20 μg were separated on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred onto nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and reacted with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for rat α2-MG, HP, or TST. Ethidium bromide staining pattern of separated RNA was used as a marker for sample loading. Synthesis and secretion of APP into the culture medium of cytokine-treated H-35 cells were quantitated by immunoelectrophoresis, using equal aliquots of cell-free conditioned medium (47Baumann H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 566-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The area under the precipitation peaks (proportional to amount of antigen) was integrated, using the NIH image program and expressed in arbitrary immunoelectrophoretic units normalized to the amount of cell protein. H-35 cells were subcultured in 96-well plates (2.5 × 104 cells/well). After 24 h, the cells were treated first for 8 h with serum-free medium, then switched to fresh serum-free medium with or without cytokines (8 wells per treatment). Following 16 h incubation, 0.4 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well and incubation continued for an additional 8 h. The cells were washed, released by trypsin, and collected onto filter paper with a cell harvester. Incorporation of 3H was measured by scintillation counting (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Statistical evaluation of the data was performed by Student's t test. To assess whether the cloned mOSMRβ formed a signaling-competent complex with gp130 and whether this complex is functional, the expression vector for mOSMRβ, together with the OSM-responsive HRRE-CAT reporter gene construct, was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells (Fig.1). HepG2 cells have an endogenous OSMR system, comprised of type I and II OSMR, that effectively mediated a prominent CAT gene induction in response to human, but not mOSM (Fig.1, left panel). Expression of transfected mOSMRβ by itself did not detectably modify the activity of the other IL-6 cytokine receptors, but introduced an mOSM-specific gene induction comparable to the endogenous hOSMR (Fig. 1, second panel). That mOSM did not promote interaction with LIFRα was confirmed by overexpression of a membrane form of hLIFRα that lacks the cytoplasmic domain (LIFRαΔcyto). This form acted as a competitive inhibitor of both full-length LIFRα and hOSMRβ of HepG2 cells by generating an hOSM-dependent, but signaling-incompetent complexes with gp130. LIFRαΔcyto eliminated the cell response to hOSM but did not affect mOSM action (Fig. 1, third panel). However, a functional, ligand-dependent cooperation of transfected mOSMRβ with the endogenous gp130 was identified by its inhibition with anti-gp130 antibodies (Fig. 1, right panel). These results established functionality of the mOSMRβ construct and indicated that human gp130 was capable of cooperating similarly with mouse and human OSM and OSMRβ in forming a signal-transducing complex. To characterize the regulatory activity of OSMR on endogenous genes as function of OSMRβ expression, we employed H-35 cells. These cells showed an approximately equal expression of gp130 and LIFRα and responded to IL-6 or LIF by a similar level of tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 (Fig. 2). As described below, the cytokine treatment also resulted in a comparable activation of STAT3 (Fig. 4 A) and induction of type 2 APPs (Fig.7 B). In H-35 cells, expression of OSMRβ mRNA was undetectable by hybridization analysis (data not shown) and mOSM treatment did not produce an appreciable regulatory effect. The LIF-like response to hOSM treatment had been attributed to the hOSM-mediated engagement of LIFRα into a type I OSMR complex, an activity not exerted by mOSM (Fig. 2 A). An unexpected finding, and convenient tool for subsequent functional analysis of receptor subunit-associated proteins, was that under the conditions selected for immunoprecipitation, the hOSM-directed interaction of LIFRα and gp130 was less stable than that directed by LIF. This is demonstrated by the absence of gp130 from the LIFRα-containing complex immunoprecipitated from hOSM-treated cells (Fig. 2 A). Identical immunoprecipitation of the LIF-induced complex yielded equal immunoblot signals for the tyrosine-phosphorylated LIFRα and gp130 subunits.Figure 4Signal transduction by IL-6 cytokine receptors. Subcultures of parental H-35 (A),mOSMRβ-H-35 cells (B and D, left three panels) and hOSMRβ-H-35 cells (C and D,right panel) were either treated with 100 ng/ml cytokines for 0 to 120 min (A and C) or with increasing concentrations of the cytokines for 15 min (D). Whole cell extracts were Western blotted for the proteins indicated to theright of each panel. Representative extracts in Aand D were used to demonstrate that cellular amounts of STATs and ERK remained constant during the treatments. The film exposures to the ECL reaction in B and C occurred simultaneously for all corresponding panels, and the films showing optimal quantitative signal differences among the samples (avoiding overexposure of most reactive bands) were used to generate the composite picture. In D, the blots for phosphorylated ERK were exposed longer to ECL reaction for demonstrating ERK activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Specific cell responses activated by cytokine receptors.

Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1992; 210: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The common characteristic that defines an aspartic protease is the presence of catalytic aspartic acid amino acid residues located in the active site of the enzyme. These aspartic acid amino acids are located in evolutionary conserved consensus sequences; (F/I/L)-D-T-G-S and D-(T/S)-G-(S/T), in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the eukaryotic enzymes, respectively (1Szecsi P.B.

A thorough understanding of aspartic protease biology in this organism may aid in the future development of anthelminthic drugs.

Here we report the discovery and characterization of a C. elegans gene, designated asp-1, which encodes an aspartic protease whose expression is developmentally regulated and limited to a subset of intestinal cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis of asp-1 leads to the subsequent identification of five other C. elegans aspartic protease genes, designatedasp-2 through asp-6. A previous report indicated that all C. elegans aspartic protease activity was derived from a single gene, which encoded the C. elegans homologue of cathepsin D, cad-1 (27Jacobson L.A. Jen-Jacobson L. Hawdon J.M. Owens G.P. Bolanowski M.A. Emmons S.W. Shah M.V. Pollock R.A. Conklin D.S. Genetics. 1988; 119: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar). Nematodes that carry homozygous, null mutations of cad-1 have ∼10% of the aspartic protease activity that is present in wild-type nematodes. Based on the results presented in the current report, we believe thatcad-1 does not encode a structural gene for a C. elegans aspartic protease; rather, the cad-1 gene product is involved in the processing of aspartic proteases. The Bristol N2 strain of C. elegans was grown at 20 °C as described previously (28Liao V.H. Freedman J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31962-31970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Purified populations of embryos were obtained by alkaline hypochlorite treatment of gravid C. elegans and synchronous populations of C. elegans for developmental studies prepared as described (29Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 603-605Google Scholar, 30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homozygous strain of C. elegans containing the mutation whose phenotype includes reduced levels of aspartic protease activity,cad-1 (j1) II (27Jacobson L.A. Jen-Jacobson L. Hawdon J.M. Owens G.P. Bolanowski M.A. Emmons S.W. Shah M.V. Pollock R.A. Conklin D.S. Genetics. 1988; 119: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from the C. elegans Genetics Center (Madison, WI). A library that is enriched in stress-induced cDNAs, as well as cDNAs that are expressed in embryos and early larvae, was constructed in the bacteriophage λZAPII (Stratagene) using mRNA from CdCl2-treated nematodes as a template (31Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Groups of recombinant phage clones that contain stress-induced cDNAs were obtained by a subtractive screening procedure (32Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the cDNAs encoded a partial protein that was related to the aspartic acid family of proteases from mammals and invertebrates. This protein was named ASP-1. A fragment of ASP-1 cDNA was used as a probe to screen a more complete C. elegans cDNA library in the phage λgt11 (CLONTECH). Six positive recombinant phage clones were plaque-purified, and the cDNAs were subsequently subcloned in pGEM3zf(+) and sequenced. A 32P-labeled, 850-bpEcoRV/SphI ASP-1 cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen an λEMBL4 C. elegans genomic library, as described previously (33Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 6.5-kbp EcoRI fragment of genomic DNA, which includes the asp-1 structural gene and 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, was identified by Southern blot analysis. This fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM3zf(+) and sequenced (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar). Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequence data, including assembly of continuous cDNA sequences, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using PCGENE-IntelliGenetics software (IntelliGenetics, Mountainview, CA) and BLAST programs (35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar, 36Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Genomic and cDNA sequence data were obtained from the C. elegans Genome Project (available through the Sanger Center) and the C. elegans EST Database (available through the DNA Data Bank of Japan), respectively. The locations within theC. elegans genome of the six-aspartic protease genes were identified using A C . e legans Database (ACeDb) (37Eeckman F.H. Durbin R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 583-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Total C. elegans RNA was prepared as described previously (38Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was purified with a “Fast Track” kit (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (33Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a 32P-labeled, full-length ASP-1 cDNA (∼1.2 kbp) as a probe. Complementary DNA was synthesized, and the cDNA was tailed with ∼20 dA residues according to the procedure of Frohman, and as described previously (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). Subsequently, ∼10% of the tailed cDNA was mixed with 10 pmol of 5′-primer 1 (5′-CGTCTAGAGATGCATGCATC(T)19-3′), 25 pmol of 5′-primer 2 (5′-CGTCTAGAGATGCATGCATC-3′), 25 pmol of 3′-primer 3 (5′-AGCCAAGAAGGCGGTGTACTTGCCC-3′), and 5 μg of yeast tRNA. The 3′-primer is the inverse complement of nucleotides 105–129 (relative to the translation start site) in the cDNA encoding ASP-1. ASP-1 cDNA was amplified by 30 cycles of the PCR as described previously (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently 2% of the product was subjected to a second round of the PCR. In this reaction 5′-primer 1 was omitted, the annealing temperature was raised from 50 to 55 °C, the magnesium concentration was increased from 1.5 to 3 mm, and an alternative 3′-primer was used. The alternative 3′-primer (5′-CTTGTGCGTTGGCACCTGGATGAC-3′) is the inverse complement of nucleotides 49–72 in the ASP-1 cDNA. The products of the reaction, ∼150-bp fragments, were digested with SphI and subsequently inserted into pGEM5zf(+). Two SphI sites are predicted to be in the amplified cDNA, one provided by 5′-primers 1 and 2, and the second in the ASP-1 cDNA at position 38. ASP-1 protein was expressed in both bacteria and cultured insect cells. A fragment of ASP-1 cDNA encoding the entire protein (396 amino acid residues) was synthesized by PCR. The 5′-primer (5′-ACCTGCAGCATATGCAGACCTTCGTTTT-3′) was identical to nucleotides 1–17 and included the translation start codon, preceded by PstI and NdeI restriction sites (underlined). The 3′-primer (5′-GAAAAACAAGCTTCTTACAATCCCTTGTGG-3′) consisted of the inverse complement of nucleotides 1175–1195 in ASP-1 cDNA, which contains the translation stop codon and included aHindIII restriction site (underlined). The amplified cDNA was digested with PstI andHindIII and cloned into identical sites in pRSET-C (Invitrogen). This placed the entire coding region of ASP-1 cDNA downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and the 45 codons that constitute an N-terminal polyhistidine fusion peptide.Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with this plasmid, designated pEX1.2, and protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C. Following this incubation, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 μg/ml lysozyme and protease inhibitors: 10 mm benzamidine and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Following 30-min incubation at 25 °C, cells were disrupted using a French press and separated into soluble and particulate fractions as described (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The particulate fraction contained the ASP-1 fusion protein. The protein pellet was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1.0 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Following centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 8 m urea and 50 mmDTT. The solubilized protein was dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 8 murea, and 5 mm imidazole and then purified to near homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography in the presence of 8m urea, as described previously (40Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 mg of highly purified ASP-1 fusion protein was obtained from a 200-ml culture of E. coli. Removal of urea by dialysis causes the purified ASP-1 fusion protein to precipitate from solution. ASP-1 fusion protein was solubilized following reduction with DTT and carboxyamidomethylation with iodoacetamide, as described previously (31Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An ASP-1 cDNA fragment that contains the entire coding region was prepared with 5′-PstI and 3′-blunt termini. This fragment was generated by first digesting pEX1.2 with HindIII and making the ends blunt. The blunt-ended product was then digested withPstI, and a 1.2-kbp fragment corresponding to the full-length ASP-1 cDNA was purified. The fragment was inserted into the baculovirus transfer plasmid pVL1392 (41O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. W. H. Freeman, New York, NY1992Google Scholar), previously digested withPstI and SmaI, to create the recombinant transfer vector pVL1392-CEP. Recombinant baculovirus were generated by co-transfecting SF9Spodoptera fugiperda ovarian cells with BaculoGold-linearized baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen) and pVL1392-CEP by calcium phosphate precipitation. The vial titer, after plaque purification and three rounds of viral amplification, was >108 plaque-forming units/ml. Recombinant ASP-1 was prepared by first infecting a 175-ml suspension culture of SF9 cells (6 × 105 cells/ml), maintained in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 28 °C, with recombinant baculovirus (2.5 × 109plaque-forming units). After a 4-day incubation, cells were collected following centrifugation at 1500 × g for 15 min. Approximately 0.5 ml of packed cells was suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). This mixture was homogenized for 45 s using a Polytron homogenizer. The lysate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 27,000 × g. The pellet was twice suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer followed by a homogenization and centrifugation. The final pellet was dissolved in 2 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 7 m urea and 0.1 m DTT, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 27,000 × g. Recombinant ASP-1 was purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Bio-Rad Preparative SDS-PAGE system. Briefly, 2 ml of solubilized ASP-1 was mixed with 0.4 ml of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and then heated to 100 °C for 10 min (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were then applied to a 10-cm, 10% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at a constant power of 10 watts following the manufacturer's instructions. ASP-1-containing fractions were identified by Western immunoblot analysis, using anti-ASP-1 antiserum. The ASP-1-containing fractions were pooled, frozen, and lyophilized. The lyophilized protein was dissolved in 10 ml of distilled deionized water and then sequentially dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, then 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 7m urea. To remove residual SDS, the dialysate was applied to a column containing Extracti-Gel D (Pierce) and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, containing 7 murea. The eluted fractions were then dialyzed against 25 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. This yielded 6.5 mg of soluble ASP-1 protein. Samples that contained a mixture of carboxyamidomethylated and insoluble ASP-1 fusion protein were injected into rabbits (0.2-mg initial injection; 0.2 mg for each of three booster injections) at Covance Laboratories (Vienna, VA) for the generation of antiserum. Purified, soluble recombinant ASP-1 was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield a final concentration of 1.5 mg of protein bound per ml of resin (43Islas-Trejo A. Land M. Tcherepanova I. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6629-6640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Antiserum was then incubated with ASP-1-Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 20 °C, and the anti-ASP-1 IgGs were isolated as described previously (43Islas-Trejo A. Land M. Tcherepanova I. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6629-6640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and particulate fractions of C. eleganshomogenates were prepared (30Land M.

Samples of proteins were denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots ofC. elegans proteins and purified ASP-1 were incubated with antiserum (1:2000), and the ASP-1 was visualized by indirect chemiluminescence, as previously reported (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Islas-Trejo A. Land M. Tcherepanova I. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6629-6640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). C. elegans were fixed, washed, and incubated sequentially with affinity-purified rabbit anti-ASP-1 antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgGs, as described by Land et al. (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence signals corresponding to ASP-1·IgG complexes were obtained with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope. C. elegans were isolated and fixed, and the external collagenous cuticle was permeabilized and prehybridized as described previously (45Ross L.H. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22066-22075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To generate a digoxigenin-labeled probe, the pEX1.2 expression plasmid was digested with HindIII andPstI and a cDNA fragment that contains the full-length ASP-1 cDNA was isolated. An antisense DNA probe containing digoxigenin-11-dUMP was generated by anchored PCR (45Ross L.H. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22066-22075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The labeled probe was then added to a suspension of fixed, permeabilized nematodes in 40% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 50 μg/ml heparin, and 0.1% Tween 20. Hybridization was carried out at 48 °C for 16 h. Subsequently, C. elegans were washed and then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with a 1:2500 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-digoxigenin antibody. Following several washes, antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by incubating the nematodes with 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. A fragment (∼1.5 kbp) of genomic DNA was isolated from the 6.5-kbp EcoRI fragment previously cloned into pGEM3zf(+) by first digesting the recombinant plasmid with SphI. The termini were made blunt by incubating the linearized plasmid with T4 DNA polymerase, and then the DNA was collected by precipitation (46Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology on CD-ROM. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). The DNA was subsequently digested with PstI, and a 1.5-kbp genomic fragment was isolated. The DNA fragment was inserted into theC. elegans β-galactosidase expression vector pPD16.51 that was cut with SmaI and PstI (47Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The DNA insert from asp-1 contains 1487 bp of 5′-flanking DNA followed by the first 11 codons of asp-1 fused in-frame with DNA encoding a nuclear localization signal and the E. coli lacZreporter gene (47Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). C. elegans were transformed by microinjecting recombinant reporter plasmid DNA (20 μg/ml) and a plasmid containing the dominant selectable marker gene rol-6 into the gonadal syncytium of young adult C. elegans as described previously (33Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Transgenic C. elegans were selected and maintained as indicated in previous studies (33Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic C. eleganswere fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity as described previously by Freedman et al. (33Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA library was prepared in the bacteriophage λZAPII, using template mRNA isolated from nematodes that were exposed to 2 mm cadmium (31Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Linder B. Jin Z. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30158-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A recombinant phage was identified that contained a cDNA insert encoding a partial polypeptide that was homologous to the aspartic acid family of proteases. A screen of a second C. elegans library, using a32P-labeled probe generated from this cDNA, yielded six clones designated P1, P4, P5, P11, P12, and P16. The average size of the cDNA inserts was ∼2 kbp. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that they correspond to overlapping cDNAs, and the cDNAs were assembled into a single, continuous sequence (Fig.1). This cDNA is predicted to encode a polypeptide that is composed of 396 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 42,692. An initiator ATG codon (nucleotides 26–28) lies within the context of the consensus C. eleganstranslation start site: (A/G)NNATG. A 3′-untranslated region of 93 bp follows the translation stop codon (nucleotides 1204–1206) and terminates with a poly(A) tail. The 5′-untranslated regions of many C. elegans mRNAs are covalently modified by the incorporation of an ∼22-nt, non-translated “leader” sequence that is donated from distinct, 100-nt spliced leader RNA transcripts (45Ross L.H.

https://openalex.org/W2045346592,"Previously, we reported the isolation of a heparan sulfate-binding collagenous protein, p200, that is expressed by Schwann cells in developing peripheral nerves ((1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 13844–13853; (1999) J. Neurosci. Res. 56, 284–294). Here, we report the cloning of p200 cDNA from a Schwann cell cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence identifies p200 as a novel member of the collagen type V gene family. This polypeptide, which we have named α4 type V (α4(V)) collagen, contains an uninterrupted Gly-X-Xcollagen domain of 1011 amino acids that shows 82% sequence identity to human α3(V) collagen and 71% identity to rat α1(V) collagen. α4(V) is secreted by Schwann cells as a collagen heterotrimer that also contains α1(V) chains. α4(V)-containing collagen molecules synthesized by Schwann cells retain their amino-terminal non-collagenous domains. α4(V) mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction amplification in neonatal and adult brain and neonatal peripheral nerve. α4(V) mRNA and protein were not detected in most other tissues, including the placenta and heart, which are known to contain α3(V). This pattern of α4(V) expression contrasted with that of α1(V) mRNA and protein, which were ubiquitously expressed. The isolated α4(V) chain demonstrated an unusually high affinity for heparin. The restricted expression and unusual properties of α4(V)-containing collagen type V molecules suggest a unique and important role for these molecules in peripheral nerve development.

Cell-ECM interactions strongly influence cell shape and cell migration, which play major roles in determining tissue structure and cellular organization, as well as cellular terminal differentiation. Studies carried out with primary cultures of embryonic peripheral nerve cells have revealed that Schwann cells are major producers of the peripheral nerve ECM (1Bunge M.B. Williams A.K. Wood P.M. Uitto U. Jeffrey J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 84: 184-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2763-2777PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we identified an ECM protein secreted by Schwann cells that binds with high affinity to heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This 200-kDa protein, which we called p200, is expressed in developing peripheral nerves and appears in the late embryonic period before the onset of myelination (3Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). p200 is not expressed in adult nerves, but its expression is induced by axotomy. This pattern of expression is distinct from that exhibited by proteins of the Schwann cell basal lamina, such as laminin and collagen type IV, which are major components of the mature endoneurial ECM. Expression of p200 is restricted. The protein is readily detected by immunoblot analysis in extracts of developing peripheral nerve tissue or Schwann cells but not in most other neonatal or adult tissues (4Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). p200 was originally isolated from conditioned medium of cultured Schwann cells on the basis of its high affinity binding to the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-3 (4Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C.

This interaction is of sufficient affinity to mediate adhesion of cultured Schwann cells to immobilized p200 by a mechanism that is inhibited by soluble heparin. Biochemical and partial amino acid sequence analysis revealed p200 to be a collagen-like protein. Schwann cells cultured in medium containing ascorbate secrete p200 as pepsin-resistant, non-covalent trimers. p200 is incorporated into fibrillar ECM produced by Schwann cells, where it co-localizes with collagen type I (3Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 2R. Stahl, M. Chernousov, and D. Carey, unpublished observations. In addition to a large collagen domain, p200 contains a glycosylated non-collagen domain with an apparent M r ∼ 80,000. This domain appears to contain the main heparin-binding site of p200 (4Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We now report the molecular cloning from a neonatal rat Schwann cell library of cDNA that encodes p200. The cDNA sequence reveals p200 to be a collagen polypeptide with a high degree of sequence homology to type V/type XI collagen α chains. Ascorbate-treated Schwann cells secrete p200 as a non-covalent heterotrimer that also contains α1(V) collagen. p200 appears to be the rat homologue of a mouse cDNA that was cloned recently (5Imamura Y. Scott I.C. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8749-8759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The authors of this report concluded that the mouse cDNA encoded the α3(V) collagen chain. Our analysis of the available data leads us to conclude, however, that p200 and the mouse cDNA actually encode a novel member of the type V/type XI collagen family, which we propose to name α4 type V collagen. The rat and mouse α4(V) collagen chains show significant homology to human α3(V). The abundant and transient expression of p200 by Schwann cells and its unique biochemical properties suggest that p200-containing collagen molecules play an important role in the development of the peripheral nervous system. Schwann cells were cultured from neonatal rat sciatic nerves as described previously (6Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-10% fetal bovine serum. 293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE-Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Native p200-containing trimer was purified from conditioned medium of ascorbate-treated Schwann cells, as described previously (3Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with several modifications. Briefly, the conditioned medium was supplemented with protease inhibitors and acidified with acetic acid to pH 3.0. p200-containing collagen was precipitated by adding crystalline NaCl to a final concentration of 1.2 m. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 m acetic acid, and dialyzed against 2 m urea, 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, plus protease inhibitors. The dialyzed material was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in 2 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Elution of p200 was monitored by immunoblot analysis. p200-containing fractions (eluted at approximately 0.55–0.75 m NaCl) were pooled, diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, to a urea concentration of 0.7m, and applied to a heparin-agarose column. The column was washed with 0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–1m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Aliquots of column fractions were analyzed on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels followed by silver staining and immunoblotting with anti-p200 or anti-α1(V) collagen antibodies. Aliquots were also analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the heparan sulfate proteoglycans syndecan-3 (7Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and glypican-1 (8Asundi V.K. Keister B.F. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Anti-proteoglycan immunoreactivity was not detected in the purified collagen preparation (data not shown). Poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated from cultured Schwann cells (Micro-FastTrack, Invitrogen) and used to synthesize cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Superscript Choice System, Life Technologies. Inc.) and a mixture of oligo(dT) and random hexamers as primers. The cDNA products were ligated to EcoRI-NotI-SalI adapters, size-fractionated, and ligated to dephosphorylated λGT11arms (Promega). Library DNA was packaged into phage using Gigapack III Gold packaging extracts (Stratagene) and amplified in Escherichia coli Y1090r−. 86,000 recombinant phage were screened with affinity-purified anti-p200 antibodies (1:500 dilution). Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:7500 dilution) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 with 2% bovine serum albumin. Positive plaques were visualized colorimetrically using 0.33 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.165 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. Phage cDNA inserts from positive plaques were obtained by PCR amplification using λforward (CCT GGA GCC CGT CAG TAT CG) and λreverse (CAA CTG GTA ATG GTA GCG AC) primers and rTth DNA polymerase XL (PE-Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were subcloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced using Big DyeTM terminators and a 377 Automated Sequencer (PE-Applied Biosystems). Full-length rat α1(V) collagen cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase-linked PCR using oligonucleotide primers based on the hamster α1(V) sequence (9Greenspan D.S. Cheng W. Hoffman G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24727-24733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of rat α1(V) was 98% identical to the mouse and hamster sequences and 94% identical to human α1(V). The non-collagenous domain of rat α1(XI) collagen cDNA was cloned by a similar method using oligonucleotide primers based on the partial rat sequence (10Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Schwann cells expressed the “acidic” form of α1(XI) mRNA. Preparation and characterization of polyclonal anti-p200 antibodies have been described previously (4Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For library screening, the antibodies were affinity-purified as follows. p200 monomer partially purified from Schwann cell conditioned medium was subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon. The p200-containing portion of the membrane was excised and incubated with anti-p200 antibodies. The membrane was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 11.5, neutralized with HCL, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Polyclonal anti-α1(V) antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with the recombinant amino-terminal non-collagenous domain expressed as a GST-fusion protein. BL21-DE3-pLysS transformants were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and lysed by sonication. The GST-fusion protein was purified by chromatography on glutatione-Sepharose and heparin-agarose. The purified protein was mixed with RIBI adjuvant and used to immunize rabbits as described previously (7Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-α1(XI) antibodies were prepared by a similar method, except the insoluble GST-fusion protein was solubilized in 8m urea and purified by preparative SDS-gel electrophoresis. The region of the gel containing the GST-fusion protein was excised and emulsified by passing through a 25-gauge syringe needle before being used for immunization. The preparation and characterization of affinity-purified anti-syndecan-3 and anti-glypican-1 antibodies have been described previously (7Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Specificity and titer of antibodies were determined by immunoblot analysis using purified recombinant proteins and Schwann cell conditioned medium and cell lysates. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described previously (11Carey D.J. Conner K. Asundi V.K. O'Mahony D.J. Stahl R.C. Showalter L.J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Hartman J. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2873-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Signals were detected and quantitated with a Lumi-Imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Schwann cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, Inc.) for 24 h in low-methionine medium. The medium was supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture, precleared with protein A-Sepharose, and mixed with an equal volume of 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Anti-p200 antibody was added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h on a rotator. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose, rinsed twice with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and dissolved in SDS-gel sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon-P, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-collagen antibodies. For these experiments, bound antibodies were detected colorimetrically using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The membrane was then air-dried and exposed to Kodak x-ray film to detect35S-labeled polypeptides. Internal peptides derived from p200 monomer were obtained by in-gel digestion of the protein as described previously (4Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except Lysyl Endopeptidase (Wako BioProducts) was used instead of trypsin, and the digestion was carried out in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.1. Amino-terminal sequencing of p200 was carried out as described previously (12Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after transfer of the protein from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel onto Immobilon-P membranes. Hind limbs from 18-day gestation rat embryos were mounted in Tissue-Tek and frozen immediately. Ten-μm thick cryosections were applied to clean glass slides and fixed for 30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with primary antibodies (diluted in 5% nonfat milk, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were rinsed and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies for 30 min. The sections were rinsed, overlaid with coverslips, and viewed with a fluorescence microscope (6Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Texas Red-X was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mouse monoclonal anti-neurofilament antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate were obtained from Sigma. Reverse transcriptase-linked PCR amplification was carried out as follows. One μg of total RNA isolated from the tissues indicated under “Results” was used as the template for synthesis of cDNA using SuperScriptTM II RNase− Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies. Inc.). Oligonucleotide primer pairs based on the rat p200 and α1(V) sequences were used in PCR amplification reactions. Sequences of the primers were: p200 sense, 5′-CCC GGG AAG ACC AGT CCA CAT C-3′; p200 antisense, 5′-GAG AGC AGC CTG AGG GTC TGG-3′); α1(V) sense, 5′-GGA TGT TGC CTA CCG AGT CTC TAA-3′; α1(V) antisense, 5′-TCA TAG GCA GCT CGG TGG TC′). 100 pmol of each primer was used per reaction withTaq DNA polymerase (Fisher). The predicted sizes of the p200 and α-1 type V PCR products were 700 and 493 base pairs, respectively. Rat tissues were minced and homogenized in 0.5 m acetic acid on ice. Pepsin (Worthington) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and digestion was carried out for 6 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Affinity-purified anti-p200 antibodies were used to screen a neonatal rat Schwann cell cDNA expression library. Nine antibody-positive clones were sequenced and found to contain overlapping cDNA inserts that encoded a collagen-like protein with a high degree of homology to collagen type V. Two overlapping clones yielded the full-length sequence of 6111 nucleotides, not including a terminal poly(A) stretch. A consensus polyadenylation and splice recognition motif (AATAAA) is present 13 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence is shown in Fig.1. The amino acid sequence begins at the 5′-most ATG of the cDNA, which initiates an open reading frame of 1373 amino acids, producing a polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 171,574. The p200 amino acid sequence is homologous to rat α1(V) collagen and α1(XI) collagen, as well as to the mouse and human cDNAs that were recently cloned (5Imamura Y. Scott I.C. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8749-8759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and reported as α3(V) collagen. The p200 amino acid sequence is 95% identical to the putative mouse α3(V) sequence but only 82% identical to the human α3(V) sequence (Fig.2). A comparison of the mouse and human amino acid sequences also revealed a sequence identity of 82%, which is significantly lower than the cross-species sequence conservation typically observed for homologous collagen α chains. A comparison of the full-length human α1(V) sequence with the rat, mouse, and hamster sequences, for example, revealed 94% amino acid identity (Fig. 2). Collagen domain sequences are even more highly conserved. The collagen domains of rat and human α1(V) collagen show more than 98% amino acid sequence identity. In contrast to this high degree of sequence homology, the collagen domains of p200 and human α3(V) show only 88% sequence identity. Similarly, a comparison of the deduced p200 sequence with sequences of peptides derived from the collagen domain of human placental α3(V) collagen revealed an overall sequence identity of 86% in 363 amino acids from eight noncontiguous peptides. In contrast, the human α3(V) amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence was 97% identical to the peptide sequences. The sequence data, plus information on the expression and biochemical properties of p200 presented below, lead us to conclude that p200 is a novel member of the collagen type V/type XI family. The putative mouse α3(V) reported recently (5Imamura Y. Scott I.C. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8749-8759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) appears to be the mouse homologue of p200. We propose the name α4 type V for this collagen chain. Inspection of the p200 protein sequence reveals several distinct structural domains. The collagen domain is the largest, and is made up of 1011 amino acids of uninterrupted Gly-X-X collagen repeats. This region is 71% homologous to the collagen domain of rat collagen α1(V) and 88% identical to the corresponding domain of human α3(V) (Fig. 2). The non-collagenous amino-terminal domain of 369 amino acids can be divided into several subdomains (Figs. 1 and 2). There is an amino-terminal signal sequence of 29 amino acids, followed by a region of 196 amino acids that shows 76 and 40% identity to the corresponding regions of collagens α3(V) and α1(V), respectively (Fig. 2). Following this region is a region of 144 amino acids in which the sequence identities drop to 50 and 14%. This unique region contains a highly basic segment in which 16 of 23 residues are either arginine or lysine, flanked by proline-rich sequences. The basic segment contains four nearly perfect concatameric repeats of the consensus heparin-binding motif XBBXB (where B is a basic amino acid). Thus, this region might account for the high affinity binding of the polypeptide to heparan sulfate (4Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Separating the amino-terminal non-collagenous domain and the collagen domain is a region of 106 amino acids that contains Gly-X-Xrepeats interrupted by non-collagenous sequences of 10 and 36 amino acids. The deduced sequence contains 5 consensus sites forN-linked glycosylation, three of which are located in the unique non-collagenous region. The conserved region of the non-collagenous domain contains four cysteine residues that are also present in similar positions in collagens α1(V) and α1(XI). Residues 30–44 of the deduced sequence match the amino-terminal amino acid sequence determined for p200 (Fig. 1), identifying the alanine at position 30 as the amino terminus of the mature polypeptide. The deduced sequence is also identical to the amino acid sequences of six internal peptides derived from the collagen domain of p200. These results confirm the identification of the cDNA as p200. Transfection of 293 cells with an expression plasmid that contained the putative coding sequence resulted in the secretion of a polypeptide that reacted strongly with anti-p200 antibodies but not α1(V) antibodies and co-migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with p200 obtained from Schwann cell conditioned medium (Fig.3). These results confirm that the cDNA contains the full-length coding sequence of p200. Ascorbate-treated Schwann cells secrete p200 as non-covalently-linked, pepsin-resistant trimers (3Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis and silver staining of p200 purified from the medium of ascorbate-treated Schwann cells revealed the presence of three polypeptide chains of 205, 200, and 190 kDa. Of these polypeptides, only the 200-kDa chain reacted on immunoblots with antibodies made against p200 (Fig. 4 A). All three polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium of ascorbate-treated Schwann cells with anti-p200 antibodies, however, demonstrating their tight association (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, only the 200-kDa chain was immunoprecipitated with anti-p200 antibodies when medium from Schwann cells not treated with ascorbate was used (not shown). These results are consistent with ascorbate-dependent assembly of p200 into a collagen heterotrimer. It has been shown that other members of the type V/type XI family form heteromeric collagen trimers. We hypothesized that p200-containing collagen heterotrimers were produced by co-assembly of p200 with other type V/XI collagen α chains. As shown in Fig. 4 B, anti-α1(V) antibodies stained on immunoblots the 205-kDa polypeptide that was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-p200 antibodies. The anti-α1(V) antibodies also stained the 205-kDa band in the purified p200-containing heterotrimer (Fig. 4 C). When conditioned medium from ascorbate-treated Schwann cells was fractionated on an anion exchange column, the α1(V) and p200 polypeptides bound to the column and co-eluted in precisely the same fractions (Fig.5). The two polypeptides were not co-eluted, however, when medium from Schwann cells that were not treated with ascorbate was used. Together, these findings demonstrate the ascorbate-dependent co-assembly of α1(V) and p200 into collagen heterotrimers in Schwann cells. In contrast to these results, anti-α1(XI) antibodies failed to stain any bands in the purified p200-containing collagen preparation. The anti-α1(XI) antibodies did react strongly with an approximately 200-kDa band in detergent extracts of Schwann cells (Fig.4 C). These results demonstrate that despite the fact that Schwann cells synthesize α1(XI), this α chain does not co-assemble with α1(V) and p200 chains in collagen trimers. p200 was identified originally on the basis of its high affinity binding to the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-3 (4Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Syndecan-3 and p200 also exhibit similar patterns of expression during embryonic and postnatal development (3Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2873-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, B and C, immunofluorescent staining of the hind limbs of embryonic day 18 rats revealed a co-localization of syndecan-3 and p200. The regions of intense syndecan-3/p200 staining corresponded to bundles of peripheral nerve fibers that course through the tissue, as revealed by staining with anti-neurofilament antibodies (Fig. 6 A). These nerve fiber bundles were also stained with anti-α1(V) antibodies (Fig.6 D), consistent with the presence of α1(V)/p200-containing collagen trimers in the nerves. However, in contrast to the syndecan-3 and p200 staining, the α1(V) staining was not restricted to the nerve. Expression of α1(V) collagen is fairly widespread, whereas our previous biochemical analyses indicated a more restricted pattern of p200 expression. α3(V) has also been reported to be widely expressed but at low levels. Expression of α1(V) and p200 mRNAs was analyzed in a panel of neonatal and adult rat tissues by reverse transcriptase-linked PCR amplification. As shown in Fig.7, an amplified product derived from α1(V) mRNA was detected in every sample tested. In contrast, p200 mRNA-derived product was detected at high levels only in neonatal brain and peripheral nerve, cultured Schwann cells, and adult brain. Lesser but detectable amounts were seen in neonatal heart and skeletal muscle and adult heart. p200 mRNA-derived product was not detected in neonatal lung, spleen, kidney, or placenta. We also compared the steady state levels of p200 and α1(V) polypeptide chains in a panel of newborn rat tissues by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 8, p200 was detected in extracts of newborn rat peripheral nerve and Schwann cells. Expression of p200 mRNA (Fig. 7) and protein (Fig. 8) in Schwann cells strongly suggests that these cells are the major producers of this protein in peripheral nerves. p200 was detected at a low level in skeletal muscle but was undetectable in extracts of the other neonatal tissues examined. These results are consistent with our previously reported findings on p200 expression (3Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol.

In contrast to this result, expression of α1(V) collagen was detected in all of the tissue extracts examined, albeit at varying levels. Two major forms of the collagen chain were detected, which displayed different apparent molecular weights on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The larger form, which appeared as a closely spaced doublet of approximately 205 kDa, was present at the highest levels in extracts of Schwann cells and newborn rat peripheral nerve where it was the predominant α1(V) form detected.

A vascular lesion stimulates the production of thrombin by initiating both a tissue factor and an intrinsic activation pathway of Factor Xa, one of the final proteinases of the blood coagulation cascade. Clinically, the specific inhibition of Factor Xa would minimize the risk of hemorrhage. Thus, the direct use of Factor Xa inhibitors is a most promising route for clinical anticoagulant therapy, because it does not present any anti-homeostatic risk. The first Factor Xa inhibitor found in leeches was antistasin, a 15-kDa protein isolated from the salivary glands of the Mexican leeches,Hementeria officinalis (1Tuszynski G.P. Gasic T. Gasic G.J. J.

Of the nine C-terminal amino acids (residues 111–119, domain III), four are positively charged (3Nutt E. Gasic T. Rodkey J. Gasic G.J. Jacobs J.W. Friedman P.A. Simpson E. J. Biol.

Gene. 1989; 75: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the recombinant protein has been produced in an insect baculovirus host-vector system (5Han J.G. Law S.W. Keller P.M.

Pharmaceutical studies on dogs have been performed, and the data show that the protein is still active 30 h after injection. Moreover, when tested in different thrombosis models, antistasin was found superior to heparin. However, its clinical development was stopped because of its strong immunogenicity. Instead, as the active site is in domain I, chimeric peptides with only domain I have been tested (5Han J.G. Law S.W. Keller P.M. Kniskern P.J. Silberklang M. Tung J.S. Gasic G.J. Fiedman P.A. Ellis R.W. Gene. 1989; 75: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that neither domain II nor III contains any intrinsic Factor Xa inhibitory activity, nor do they contribute to the activity of domain I. The most potent synthetic peptide derived from antistasin corresponded to amino acids 27–49, with a disulfide bridge linking acids 29–47. This peptide inhibited Factor Xa with aK i of 35 μm and increased plasma clotting time more than 4-fold, at a concentration of 33 μm (6Ohta N. Brush M. Jacobs J.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 72: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The shortest peptide displaying anticoagulant activity was D-RCRVHCP, which increased clotting times by 50% at micromolar concentrations (6Ohta N. Brush M. Jacobs J.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 72: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Based on these results and the understanding of the molecular mechanisms implicated in Factor Xa inhibition, new anticoagulants such as DX-9065a have been produced (6Ohta N. Brush M. Jacobs J.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 72: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of these novel molecules are currently being evaluated (7Whitlow M. Arnaiz D.O. Buckman B.O. Davey D.D. Griedel B. Guilford W.J. Koovakkat S.K. Liang A. Mohan R. Phillips G.B. Seto M. Shaw K.J. Xu W. Zhao Z. Light D.R. Morrissey M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

We report here the biochemical characterization and cDNA cloning of a novel Factor Xa inhibitor isolated from the rhynchobdellid leechTheromyzon tessulatum. Its biological activity toward several serine proteases has also been investigated. This molecule is the most potent Factor Xa inhibitor found to date in leeches. Starved T. tessulatum leeches were maintained in our laboratory as described elsewhere in detail (8Malecha J. Verger-Bocquet M. Tramu G. Can. J. Zool. 1989; 67: 636-640Crossref Google Scholar). Chromogenic substrates S-2765 for chymotrypsin, S-2238 for trypsin and Factor Xa, and S-2586 for thrombin were purchased from Kabi Diagnostica (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was obtained from J. T. Baker Inc. Trifluoroacetic acid, porcine pancreatic elastase (EC 3.4.21.11), chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1), trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4), cathepsin G (EC 3.4.21.20), thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5), and chromogenic substrates (benzoyl-arginine p-nitroanilide,N-succinyl Ala-Ala-Ala p-nitroanilide,N-succinyl Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe) were obtained from Sigma. Molecular weight calibration markers for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of analytical grade. After anesthetizing the animals using 0.01% chloretone, the anterior parts of starved T. tessulatum stage 2 were excised (8Malecha J. Verger-Bocquet M. Tramu G. Can. J. Zool. 1989; 67: 636-640Crossref Google Scholar). They were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Eight-gram aliquots were thawed and placed in 25 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4 (200 mm NaCl), and homogenized at 4 °C with a Polytron (Bioblock Scientific, Villeneuve d'ascq, France) (five 15-s bursts on setting 9). After centrifugation (30 min at 10,000 × g on a Beckman JA-20 rotor at 4 °C), the pellet was re-extracted twice with Tris/NaCl. Supernatants were combined, concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge (Savant), and filtered on nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm pore size, Millipore). The extract was applied onto a fast protein liquid chromatography column (Superdex G75, 16/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; equilibrated with Tris/NaCl) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and eluted with the same buffer. The column effluent was monitored by UV absorbance (Beckman) at 280 nm. All column fractions (1 ml) were assayed for protease inhibitor activity against Factor Xa. Pooled active fractions were loaded onto a Mono Q column (fast protein liquid chromatography, HR 5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a discontinuous linear gradient of 0.2 to 1.5 m NaCl over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Active fractions were applied to a C8 Lichrosphere RP100 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Merck) with a linear gradient of 1% acetonitrile/min in water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. All HPLC purifications were performed with a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with a Beckman 168 photodiode array detector. To follow the purification, chromogenic assays were used. Enzyme assays were carried out at room temperature in 96-well microtiter plates (Dynatec). The color developed from the hydrolysis of peptide-nitroanilide (pNA) substrates was monitored at 405 nm on a Dynatec MR-5000 microtiter reader. The concentration of the purified Factor Xa inhibitor was estimated by the Bradford procedure using γ-globulin as a standard (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211784) Google Scholar). Typically, the assay included 3 μm proteolytic enzyme in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4 (0.2 m NaCl), and an aliquot of selected column fractions in a total volume of 100 μl. After 15 min of incubation, substrate was added for 5 min and then stopped with 50% acetic acid, and the residual activity was determined. At different stages of purification, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of reduced and denatured proteins was performed in 10–25% polyacrylamide gradient gels in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, as described by Laemmli (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205478) Google Scholar). Finally, before microsequencing, the purity of the peptide was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis. Samples were injected for 5 s under vacuum into a 270A-HT capillary electrophoresis system (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 72-cm long fused silica capillary. Separation from the anode to the cathode was carried out in 20 mm citrate buffer (pH 2.5) using a voltage of 20 kV at 30 °C. Capillary effluent was monitored by its absorption at 200 nm. Purified peptide (1 μl) was then deposited on a thin layer of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid crystals made by fast evaporation of a saturated solution in acetone. The droplet was allowed to air-dry before being introduced into the mass spectrometer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) measurement was performed in a Bruker BIFLEXTM system (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) operating in the positive linear mode. Before microsequencing, 50 pm inhibitor was dissolved in 40 μl of reduction solution containing 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and 0.1m dithiothreitol. The sample was flushed with nitrogen and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h in the dark. Freshly distilled 4-vinylpyridine (2 μl) was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. The pyridylethylated peptide was then separated by reversed-phase HPLC. Automated Edman degradation of the purified peptide and detection of phenylthiohydantoin (PTH-Xaa) derivatives were performed on a pulsed liquid automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 473A). A combination of enzymic digestion, separation, and Edman degradation finally allowed us to obtain the complete sequence of therostasin. In this case, an aliquot of the s-β-pyridylethylated peptide was digested with endoproteinase Glu-C (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) or endoproteinase Arg-C (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Digestions were carried out at 37 °C in the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The digestion was stopped with acidified water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The peptide mixture resulting from the enzymatic digestion was applied to a RP100 C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Merck) equilibrated with acidified water as above. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in acidified water over 80 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Emerging peaks were concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge (Savant) before sequencing. To determine the specificity of therostasin, its inhibitory activity toward different serine-proteases was compared using established chromogenic assay methods. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K i) for the complexes of therostasin with individual proteases were determined essentially as described by the method of Henderson (12Henderson P. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and simplified by Bieth (13Bieth J.G. Bull. Eur. Physiopathol. Respir. 1980; 16: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing amounts of therostasin were incubated with a constant amount of protease in Tris/NaCl (pH 8.4) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the remaining protease activity was measured by the addition of the chromogenic substrate. The remaining protease activity was monitored by UV absorbance at 405 nm. Graphical analysis yielded an apparent K i using the equation: [I]/(1 − a) =K iapp(1/a) + [P], where [I] and [P] are the initial concentrations of inhibitor and protease, respectively, and a is the remaining fractional protease activity (100% control activity = fractional activity of 1.0). Total RNA was extracted from anterior parts of T. tessulatum using the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride centrifugation method (11Maniatis T. Frisch E.F. Sambrook J. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.19-7.23Google Scholar). First-strand cDNAs were prepared from these total RNAs using standard procedures (11Maniatis T. Frisch E.F. Sambrook J. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.19-7.23Google Scholar). A probe homologue used for screening a λgt11 library, synthesized from anterior parts of T. tessulatum at stage 2, was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with first-strand cDNA as a template. The standard PCR condition involves initial heating at 94 °C for 5 min followed thereafter by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 48 °C for 2 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The cycles were followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The final PCR mixtures (10 μl) were analyzed on 2% (w/v) agarose gel. The PCR products were ligated into the PCR-II vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Dideoxy sequencing reactions of the recombinant plasmids were analyzed with the T7 sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The homologous probe was then used to clone the complete cDNA from the λgt11 library. The nucleotide sequences were analyzed by the dideoxy chain termination method. A HindIII/BamHI fragment of approximately 900 bp, containing the entire coding region of therostasin, was used to prepare cRNA probes. Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled antisense and sense riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription using the DIG RNA labeling kit and T3 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).BamHI plus T3 polymerase gave a sense probe, andHindIII with T7 polymerase produced the antisense probe. The synthesis was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C followed by a 15-min incubation with 20 units of RNase-free DNase I to remove the template. The transcript was lithium chloride-precipitated and pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in RNase-free water. The probe concentration was evaluated on a 0.8% agarose gel. Animals were anesthetized with 0.01% chloretone. They were fixed overnight at 4 °C by immersion in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, embedded in paraffin wax, and serially sectioned at 8 μm. Sections were collected onto polylysine-coated slides and stored at 4 °C until used for in situ hybridization. After removal of paraffin with toluene, sections were placed into 0.1 m glycine (0.2 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4), for 10 min prior to treatment with proteinase K (1 μg/ml in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA) for 15 min at 37 °C. Slides were then rinsed in water followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 15 min at 20 °C. Slides were treated with 0.1 mtriethanolamine (pH 8.0) for 10 min followed with 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min. The sections were rinsed again in water, dehydrated by graded alcohols, and allowed to air dry. The digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were diluted in hybridization buffer (approximately 20–50 ng RNA/section). The hybridization buffer contained 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 10× Denhardt's solution, 0.5 mg/ml Escherichia coli tRNA, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Tissue sections were apposed to the diluted probe with coverslips and placed in a hybridization chamber containing Whatman filter paper moistened with 4× SSC (sodium saline citrate buffer) and 50% formamide. The hybridization boxes were then sealed and placed in a 55 °C oven overnight. The slides were then washed twice (2 × 30 min) with 2× SSC. After treatment with RNase A (20 μg/ml in 2× SSC) for 30 min at 37 °C, sections were subsequently rinsed in 1× SSC containing 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol, in 0.5× SSC, 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol, and in 0.1× SSC 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol (10 min each). Sections were then immersed in 0.1× SSC containing 2-mercaptoethanol (2 × 30 min) at 55 °C and rinsed in 0.1× SSC at room temperature. Sections were washed in DIG buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated in the same buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 2% normal sheep serum for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes with DIG buffer for 10 min, the slides were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:1000, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This was carried out in DIG buffer containing 1% normal sheep serum and 0.05% Triton X-100 in a humid chamber for 16 h at 20 °C. The slides were washed sequentially with DIG buffer (3 × 10 min) and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mmMgCl2 (1 × 10 min). Bound antibody was visualized by incubation with a chromogen solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 375 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 188 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 1 mmlevamisole, and 1.3% dimethyl sulfoxide for 6 h in the dark at room temperature. The chromogen reaction was halted by rinsing the slides in DIG buffer (2 × 15 min). The slides were then rapidly dehydrated, rinsed in toluene, and covered with coverslips using XAM (Merck) mounting medium. Replacing the antisense riboprobe with the sense riboprobe carried out control for in situ hybridization. T. tessulatum takes three blood meals during its life. After the third blood meal, apoptosis of the salivary gland occurs (8Malecha J. Verger-Bocquet M. Tramu G. Can. J. Zool. 1989; 67: 636-640Crossref Google Scholar, 15Sawyer R.T. Leech Biology and Behavior. I. Oxford Science Publications, Clarendon Press, Oxford1986Google Scholar). To obtain the maximum amount of Factor Xa inhibitor present in T. tessulatum, an extract of the anterior part of hungry leeches was prepared from animals at stage 2 of their life cycle (TableI). The crude extract was then fractionated on a gel filtration column (Superdex G75, 16/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In the collected fractions, inhibitory activity toward Factor Xa was found for proteins with a molecular size of less than 30 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig.1 C, lane b). The inhibitor was then purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column using a stepwise gradient of NaCl from 0.2 to 1.5 m. The Factor Xa inhibitor was eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration ranging between 0.5 and 0.75 m (Fig. 1 A). SDS-PAGE controls revealed several protein bands at a molecular mass of around 15 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane c). Finally, this peptide was purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC on a C8 Lichrosphere column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water (Fig.1 B). Most of the inhibitory activity eluted in one peak at 31% acetonitrile with a molecular mass of 14 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 C, lane d). Mass measurement in MALDI-TOF MS of the purified fraction confirmed a single protein with a mass of 8991 kDa (data not shown). Comparison of the mass of this native molecule and that of s-β-pyridylethylated (8991 versus 10698.7 Da) demonstrated the presence of 16 cysteine residues in the molecule.Table IPurification of therostasinStepInhibitorSpecific activityProteinPurification factorμgIU/mgmgLeech extract800.0153001Superdex G750.860.833.255Mono Q0.415.81.6387Reversed phase0.00082780.015200Eight grams of leech extract was used as starting material.

Open table in a new tab Eight grams of leech extract was used as starting material. One inhibition unit (IU) was defined as the amount (μg) of protease inhibited at 100% (see “Experimental Procedures”). The primary structure of the T. tessulatum Factor Xa inhibitor was established by N-terminal sequencing followed by enzymatic cleavages (Endoproteinase Arg C and Glu C) (Fig.2). The peptide contains 82 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 8990 Da, which is in perfect agreement with the molecular mass measured by MALDI-TOF MS (8991 Da). This Factor Xa inhibitor, designated therostasin, is a cysteine-rich peptide without post-translational modifications. Compared with other inhibitors characterized from T. tessulatum (16Salzet M. Chopin V. Baert J. Matias I. Malecha J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30774-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), therostasin shows 70 and 47% sequence identity with theromin, a thrombin inhibitor (16Salzet M. Chopin V. Baert J. Matias I. Malecha J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30774-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and tessulin (17Chopin V. Stefano G.B. Salzet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 662-668Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor, respectively. A comparison of therostasin with other leech Factor Xa inhibitors revealed about 20% sequence identity with the inhibitory potency domain of ghilanten (domain I) (2Brankamp R.G. Blankenship D.T. Sunkara P.S. Cardin A.D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1990; 115: 89-97PubMed Google Scholar) and antistasin (domain I) (1Tuszynski G.P. Gasic T. Gasic G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9718-9723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, therostasin shows 31% sequence identity with the internal repeats 4 and 5 of Hydra antistasin, a Factor Xa inhibitor isolated from Hydra (18Holstein T.W. Mala C. Kur E. Bauer K. Greber M. David C.N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, therostasin shows 26- 37% sequence identity with antistasin-type proteins isolated from leeches including guamerin (19Jung H.I. Kim S.I. Ha K.-S. Joe C.O. Kang K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13879-13884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), hirustasin (20Söllner C. Mentele R. Eckerskorn C. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and piguamerin (21Kim D.R. Kang K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of therostasin with these peptides revealed that identity is observed mainly in the C terminus of these inhibitors (Fig. 3). By sequence similarity with antistasin, the putative active site (P1-P1′) of therostasin is expected to be at position 36–37 and would be RI versusRV for antistasin. Therostasin is highly specific for Factor Xa (K i: 34 pm). As antistasin, it also inhibits trypsin in a weaker manner (K i: 7 nm) but does not inhibit other serine proteases such as chymotrypsin, elastase, cathepsin G, or thrombin (TableII). This is in contrast to Kunitz inhibitors, which do inhibit these proteases (22Laskowski M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar).Table IIBiological activity of therostasin and antistasinEnzymesTherostasinAntistasinChymotrypsinφφTrypsin7.0 nm5 nmCathepsin GφN.D.PlasminφN.D.ElastaseφφUrokinaseφN.D.ThrombinφN.D.Factor Xa34 pm0.62 nmφ, no inhibition; N.D., not determined. Open table in a new tab φ, no inhibition; N.D., not determined. Based on the first 33 amino acids of the therostasin N-terminal sequence, two degenerated oligonucleotide primers, (5′-TCTAGACCCGGGCA(A/G)GA(C/T)TG (C/T)GA(A/G)GA(A/G)AA(C/T)AC3-′ and 5′-GAATTCGAGCTC(C/T)TGCT(T/G)(A/C/G/T)GC(A/G)TC(A/G)TTC(A/G)CA-3′), were used in PCR, with first-strand cDNA generated by reverse transcription. A PCR-amplified oligonucleotide of 132 bp was obtained. Its sequence analysis showed an open reading frame following oligonucleotide 1 that extends through the known therostasin sequence (data not shown). Two positive clones (T1α and T12) of approximately 2 × 106 phage lysates from the T. tessulatum λgt11 library were identified using the 132-bp oligo probe. After EcoRI digestion of the purified recombinant phage T1α or T12, a single band (approximately 900 bp) with a similar size was identified. After subcloning in pBluescript II KS vector, the nucleotide sequence of T12 cDNA insert was determined. This finding revealed that this clone contains an uninterrupted open reading frame of 303 nucleotides preceded by a 180- nucleotide 5′-untranslated sequence and followed by a 342-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region (Fig.4). The first hexanucleotide AATAAA consensus signal for polyadenylation was found at position 740 (Fig.4). Translation of the open reading frame gives a 101-amino acid residue sequence that matches the sequence of the mature protein (Fig.4). A 19-amino acid pre-peptide beginning with the Met residue precedes the N-terminal Asp residue of mature therostasin. This 19-amino acid sequence contains a hydrophobic core of 17 amino acids. cDNA sequence comparison revealed no homology with any cDNA known, demonstrating that the therostasin cDNA sequence is also completely new. In situhybridization with DIG-labeled riboprobes was used to detect the therostasin messages in leech paraffin sections. A relatively intense signal was detected in the salivary glands (Fig.5 A). Not all cells were stained. No signal was observed in sections hybridized with the therostasin sense strand (Fig. 5 B). Using an antibody performed against the N-terminal part of synthetic therostasin on serial sections of T. tessulatum, a relatively weak, but specific, immunolabeling was found in salivary glands (data not shown), confirming that the protein is stored in these cells. We have purified a novel Factor Xa inhibitor from the rhynchobdellid leech T. tessulatum, designated therostasin. This consists of an 82-amino acid residue peptide preceded by 19 residues, representing a signal peptide sequence, localized in the salivary glands of the leech. Therostasin is a novel and highly specific Factor Xa inhibitor (K i: 34 pm) isolated from leeches. For the Factor Xa “family” inhibitors isolated from leeches, two molecules consisting of 119 amino acid residues with anti-metastasic activity, antistasin and ghilianten, have been isolated in the Glossiphoniidae leeches Hementeria officinalis (1Tuszynski G.P. Gasic T. Gasic G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9718-9723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hementeria ghilianii, respectively (2Brankamp R.G. Blankenship D.T. Sunkara P.S. Cardin A.D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1990; 115: 89-97PubMed Google Scholar). These native molecules are slow, tight-binding inhibitors with estimated dissociation constants ranging between 0.31 and 0.62 nm (2Brankamp R.G. Blankenship D.T. Sunkara P.S. Cardin A.D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1990; 115: 89-97PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Xa inhibitor has been isolated from other invertebrates. For example, in the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum, a small molecule with a molecular mass of 8.7 kDa, and a high intrinsicK i (323.5 pm), has been found (23Capello M. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Huang S. Hotez P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6152-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the insect Ornithodoros moubata, a tick anticoagulant peptide with a reversible and potent Factor Xa inhibition (K i: 0.18–0.59 nm) has been also reported (24Waxman L. Smith D.E. Arcuri K.E. Vlasuk G.P. Science. 1990; 248: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, the sequence of therostasin revealed no homology with the hookworm or the tick molecule. Factor Xa inhibitor has also been found in prokaryotes. Ecotin has been characterized as a periplasmatic protein in Escherichia coli (25Seymour J.L"

We have previously demonstrated that a polypeptide corresponding to the first 191 amino acids of troponin T (TnT-(1–191)) activates the actomyosin Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase in the presence of tropomyosin. In order to further characterize this activation domain, we constructed troponin T fragments corresponding to residues 1–157 (TnT-(1–157)), 1–76 (TnT-(1–76)), 77–157 (TnT-(77–157)), 77–191 (TnT-(77–191)), and 158–191 (TnT-(158–191)). Assays using these fragments demonstrated the following: (<i>a</i>) residues 1–76 do not bind to tropomyosin or actin; (<i>b</i>) residues 158–191 bind to actin cooperatively but not to tropomyosin; (<i>c</i>) the sequence 77–157 is necessary for troponin interaction with residue 263 of tropomyosin; (<i>d</i>) TnT-(77–191) on its own activates the actomyosin ATPase activity as described previously for TnT-(1–191). TnT-(1–157), TnT-(1–76), TnT-(77–157), TnT-(158–191), and combinations of TnT-(158–191) with TnT-(1–157) or TnT-(77–157) showed no effect on the ATPase activity. We conclude that the activation of actomyosin ATPase activity is mediated by a direct interaction between amino acids 77 and 191 of troponin T, tropomyosin, and actin."

In this investigation, 22 species from 12 families of tropical sponges collected in Los Roques National Park (Venezuela) were screened for the presence of lectins. Nine saline extracts exhibited strong hemagglutinating activity against pronase-treated hamster red blood cells; five of these reacted against rabbit red blood cells, four with trypsin-treated bovine red blood cells, and five with human red blood cells regardless of the blood group type. Extracts from the three species studied from genusAplysina (archeri, lawnosa, andcauliformis) were highly reactive and panagglutinating against the panel of red blood cells tested. The lectins from A. archeri and A. lawnosa were purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation, affinity chromatography onp-aminobenzyl-β-1-thiogalactopyranoside-agarose, and gel filtration chromatography. Both lectins exhibited a native molecular mass of 63 kDa and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions have an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa, thus suggesting they occur as homotetramers. The purified lectins contain 3–4 mol of divalent cation per molecule, which are essential for their biological activity. Hapten inhibition of hemagglutination was carried out to define the sugar binding specificity of the purifiedA. archeri lectin. The results indicate a preference of the lectin for nonreducing β-linked d-Gal residues being the best inhibitors of red blood cells binding methyl-β-d-Gal and thiodigalactoside (Galβ1–4-thiogalactopyranoside). The behavior of several glycans on immobilized lectin affinity chromatography confirmed and extended the specificity data obtained by hapten inhibition.

Aplysina archeri lectin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In animals, only a few phyla have been screened for the presence and distribution of lectins. In particular, the number of lectins that have isolated from invertebrate organisms is quite small as compared with the great variety of lectins isolated from plant origin and have been limited to those partially characterized from mollusks and crustaceans. Since the discovery of hemagglutinins in sponges by Doddet al. (1Dodd R.Y. MacLennan A.P. Hawkins D.C. Vox Sang. 1968; 15: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), there have been some reports on the partial characterization (serological and immunoelectrophoretic properties) of lectins from the oldest multicellular animals (2Müller W.E.

However, their properties and specificities have not been clearly defined. In this report, we present data on an investigation undertaken to search for novel lectins in marine organisms, which could show unique properties. In addition, we describe the purification and characterization of the lectins present in two species of tropical sponges, Aplysina lawnosaand Aplysina archeri. We present information on the nature and specificity of their combining site as examined by hapten inhibition experiments and affinity chromatography. The sponges were collected in the Los Roques National Park (Venezuela), in the Caribbean Sea. The sponge tissue was dried at room temperature (about 20 °C for 3 days). The dry material was reduced to powder in a mortar and stored at −70 °C until used. The dry tissue was extracted by stirring 50 g with 1 liter of 0.9% NaCl (containing 1 mm each CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2 plus 0.02% NaN3) overnight at 4 °C. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 15000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, filtered through 0.2-μm filters, is referred to as crude extract. All glycoproteins were from Sigma. Monosaccharides and disaccharides were from Sigma and/or Dextra Laboratories. Oligosaccharides other than specified were from Dextra Laboratories. Terminal residues of neuraminic acid were removed by mild acid hydrolysis (10 mm HCl, 70 °C, 1 h) or digestion with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (Oxford Glycosystems, Oxford, UK). Oligosaccharides were reductively labeled with NaB3H4 or for oligosaccharides 18, 21, and 23 by galactose oxidase followed by NaB3H4reduction. Oligosaccharide 6 was obtained from oligosaccharide 4 by digestion with jack bean β-galactosidase (Oxford Glycosystems). Oligosaccharides 14 and 15 were obtained from mutant Ric21 of BHK (baby hamster kidney) cells as described previously (12Sato S. Anmasahum T. Hughes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11485-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and treated with α-fucosidase (bovine epididymis, Oxford Glycosystems, UK). Oligosaccharide 17 was obtained from Oxford Glycosystems. Oligosaccharide 18 was obtained from human transferrin by Pronase digestion as described (9Bayard G.S.B. Fournet B. Strecker G. Bouquelet S. Montreuil J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 50: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar); in some instances, we obtained oligosaccharide 16 by hydrazinolisis of oligosaccharide 18. Oligosaccharides 19 and 20 were purified from bovine prothrombin (10Mizuochi T. Yamashita K. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6419-6425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), oligosaccharide 21 from BHK cells, and oligosaccharides 22 and 23 from bovine fetuin (11Takasaki S. Kobata A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5706-5715Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) as described (12Sato S. Anmasahum T. Hughes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11485-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide 24 was prepared from the tetrasialylated fraction of human α1-acid glycoprotein after hydrazinolisis (13Yoshima H. Matsumoto A. Mizuochi T. Kawasaki T. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8476-8484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Red blood cells from the following species were used: bovine, rat, hamster, rabbit and human blood group A, B, and O. The blood was collected in 3.8% sodium citrate and washed three times with 0.9% NaCl by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 5 min. the final pellet was resuspended with 0.9% NaCl to give a 4% cell suspension. The hemagglutination was performed at room temperature by serial dilution (1:2 with 0.9% NaCl) with a Takatsy microtitrator (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA) using 0.025-ml loops and 4% suspension of erythrocytes. A Coulter counter was used to count the remaining cells in suspension after a 1-h incubation; 1 hemagglutinating unit is defined as the amount of lectin able to agglutinate and hence precipitate 75% of the red blood cells in suspension after 60 min. For semiquantitative results (as during the purification), the hemagglutinating activity was defined as the reciprocal of the end point dilution giving a clear macroscopic agglutination at 60 min. Where indicated, the 4% red blood cell suspension was treated with Pronase (1 mg/ml; Sigma) or trypsin (250 μg/ml; Sigma) in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 150 mm NaCl containing 10 mm CaCl2 or in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, respectively, for 1 h at 37 °C. The red blood cells were washed three times before being resuspended at 4% in phosphate-buffered saline. The clear, dialyzed 15–30% ammonium sulfate fraction (250 ml) was passed through ap-aminobenzyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside-agarose (Sigma) column (2 × 8 cm) equilibrated in Buffer A (Hepes 50 mm, NaCl 100 mm, pH 7.6, containing CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2, each at 1 mm) and washed with the same buffer until the optical density at 280 nm was below 0.020. Specific elution of the lectins was effected by 0.2 m thiodigalactoside in Buffer A. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and analyzed for protein content by the BCA method and for hemagglutinating activity against pronase-treated hamster erythrocytes. This purification scheme was used for bothA. archeri and A. lawnosa extracts. This was done by quantitative hapten inhibition using immobilized asialo α1-acid glycoprotein as a model glycoprotein. Briefly, asialo α1-acid glycoprotein dissolved in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, containing 0.02% sodium azide (Buffer A) at 4 μg/ml was applied (50 μl) to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C. The plate was then rinsed three times with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Buffer B). The remaining sites on the plate were coated by incubation with 350 μl of Buffer A containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 25 °C for 1 h. A 50-μl aliquot of biotinylated purified A. archeri lectin at about 50 pmol/ml in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl was mixed with aliquots of the different glycans at 4 °C for 2 h and then applied to each well and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The plate was washed three times with Buffer A and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added to each well. Finally, the plate was washed four times with Buffer B, and 100 μl of the substrate solution (ABTS, 0.3 mg/ml, dissolved in 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.012% H2O2) was added and incubated at 25 °C for 10–20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 5% SDS and the absorbance read at 405 nm. The carbohydrate content was measured by the phenol-H2SO4 method with glucose as the standard. Samples of purified lectins were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy, either directly or after dialysis against 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, followed by dialysis against 150 mm NaCl in the presence of Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad). The metal-free lectins were tested for hemagglutinating activity as described above before incubation for 1 h in the absence or presence of different divalent cations. Solutions of purified A. archeri or A. lawnosa lectins (2.8 mg/ml) and lactose containing [14C]lactose were made in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8. Each chamber of the dialysis cells received 100 μl of the protein or monosaccharide solution. After equilibration for 50 h at 4 °C, aliquots (80 μl) were removed from each chamber and counted on a Beckman scintillation counter after being mixed with 10 ml of aqueous scintillation fluid. Purified Aplysina archeri lectin (AAL)1was coupled to AffiGel 10 (Bio-Rad) as suggested by the manufacturer in the presence of 100 mm lactose. The resin containing 4.5 mg of lectin/ml of resin was packed into a column (3-ml bed volume). The packed column was washed with 25 ml of Buffer A (50 mmHepes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, and CaCl2 and MgCl2, each at 10 mm). Labeled glycopeptides were applied to the column in volumes of 100 μl or less and allowed to interact for at least 1 h at ∼22 °C. The columns were eluted with Buffer A followed by 10 mm and 100 mm thiodigalactose in Buffer A. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and assayed for radioactivity. The recovery of labeled material was always higher than 92% of the amount applied to the column. In an effort to identify lectins with novel affinity properties, we studied 22 species from 12 families of tropical sponges for the presence of hemagglutinating activity against a panel of normal or protease-treated red blood cells from different species. The results are summarized in Table I. A total of 10 species from 8 families showed some sort of agglutinating activity against some of the red blood cells tested. Three of those species also showed lytic activity against some of the red blood cells used in this system. The remaining 12 sponge species analyzed showed only lytic activity against all or some of the red blood cells tested. No species selectivity was noticed with the exception of Niphates erecta extract that showed hemagglutinating activity only against red blood cells from rat. In addition, there was no evidence of red blood cells susceptible to hemagglutination that could be used as a model system in the search for lectin activities.Table ICharacterization of hemagglutinating or lytic activity from crude saline sponge extracts against different red blood cellsSpecies testedTiter againstaNR, normal rabbit red blood cells; TR, trypsin-treated rabbit red blood cells; NH, normal hamster red blood cells; PH, pronase-treated hamster red blood cells; TB, trypsin-treated bovine red blood cells; Nrat, normal rat red blood cells; O, A, B, refer to human red blood cells from blood groups O, A, and B, respectively; AT, trypsin-treated human blood group A red blood cells; L, lysis of the red blood cells was observed.

Open table in a new tab Interestingly, all the members of the Aplysina sp. showed the highest titers of hemagglutinating activities in addition to being able to agglutinate red blood cells from all of the species tested. This finding prompted us to purify and characterize the lectin activity(ies) of A. archeri and A. lawnosa, from which a sufficient amount of biological material could be collected. The dark brown-violet crude saline extract from A. archeriwas first fractionated by precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 with more than 75% of the total hemagglutinating activity found in the cut between 15 and 30% saturation (NH4)2SO4 that contains less than 20% of the total protein (Fig.1 A), giving a purification of almost 4-fold above the crude extract. The clear, dialyzed solution (15–30% cut) was then applied to the affinity chromatography as described under ”Experimental Procedures.“ After extensively washing the nonadsorbed proteins, the hemagglutinating activity was specifically eluted with 200 mm thiodigalactose. Eluting the column with 1m NaCl or 1m MgCl2did not release more hemagglutinating activity or material absorbing at 280 nm (Fig. 1 B). In another experiment, the column was eluted with 500 mm EDTA releasing a sharp peak containing the hemagglutinating activity; further elution with thiodigalactose did not release any more hemagglutinating activity from the column (data not shown). It is important to mention that the specific activity of the material eluted with EDTA was consistently lower than the material eluted specifically with thiodigalactose. When A. lawnosaextracts where applied to the affinity column, the pattern of elution was identical (data not shown) to that of A. archeri. Further purification of the lectins was accomplished by gel filtration on a calibrated Sephacryl S200 column (1.5 × 90 cm). The hemagglutinating activity from either species eluted from the column as a sharp symmetric peak at a volume corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 63,000 Da (Fig. 2), with no additional peaks exhibiting hemagglutinating activity. The fractions with the highest specific activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The purified lectins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig.3. Each purified lectin appeared as a single band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 16,000 Da, regardless of the presence or absence of reducing agents, which according to the native molecular mass, suggests that the lectins are organized in the native state as homotetramers. By chromatofocusing of the purified lectins, both of them eluted as sharp bands at pH 4.1 and 4.5 for A. archeri and A. lawnosa, respectively (Fig. 4) The carbohydrate content of the purified lectins amounted to 3.5 and 5% for A. archeri and A. lawnosa agglutinins, respectively. The hemagglutinating activity of both lectins was abolished by demetalization; this effect was reversible, as addition of CaCl2, MgCl2 to the metal-free lectins fully restored the activity. By contrast, manganese was less effective in restoring the hemagglutinating activity (about 45%), and zinc was without effect. Analysis by atomic spectroscopy of the metal content of the purified native lectins revealed that they contain significant amounts of calcium and magnesium. The contents were as follows: 0.5–0.8 atoms of Ca2+ and 0.3–0.4 atoms of Mg2+/subunit. As the total of calcium and magnesium is close to 1 mol/mol subunit of molecular mass 16 kDa, it suggests that these metals may be in the same site. These metal contents were diminished by 80–90% by prior dialysis against EDTA. The number of carbohydrate binding sites on the purified lectins was determined by equilibrium dialysis, using [14C]lactose (which is also able to displace the lectins from the affinity support used for the purification). The data are shown in Fig.5, plotted according to Scatchard. The number of binding sites obtained from that curve was found to be 3.8 ± 0.4 and 3.6 ± 0.3 for A. archeri andA. lawnosa lectins, respectively. As both lectins are likely to be tetramers under those conditions of ionic strength and pH, our data indicate one binding site per subunit of 16 kDa. To characterize the carbohydrate binding specificity of purifiedA. archeri lectin, hapten inhibition experiments were performed. An examination of the results shown in Fig.6 and summarized in TableII reveals that d-galactose and d-fucose were almost equal inhibitors on a molar basis;d-glucose and d-mannose were inactive up to 5000 nmol. d-GalNAc and d-GalNH2 inhibited 50% at 2500 and 1200, nmol, respectively, being 3.2 and 6.7 times less active than d-Gal. 2-Deoxy-d-Gal was three times more potent than d-Gal. Thus the site is specific for a terminal nonreducing d-Gal with the modifications at C-2 being important and that the OH at C-6 not essential. Introduction of a nonpolar substituent (methyl,p-nitrophenyl or 4-methylumbelliferyl) in either anomeric configuration proved a significant modification in increasing the affinity for the lectin. However, in all cases, the β-configuration was preferred. Thus, the most potent monosaccharide, methyl-β-d-Gal is 37 times more potent thand-Gal compared with only 3.7 times for methyl-α-d-Gal; andp-nitrophenyl-β-d-Gal is almost 7 times more effective than d-Gal compared with only 2 times for the α conformer. Methyl-β-d-thiogalactose was the second best inhibitor (50% inhibition at 12 nmol, 30 times more potent thand-Gal). With the more bulky substituent 4-methylumbelliferyl aglycon, the differences were less significant, as shown in Table II.Table IIInhibition by monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and glycoproteins of red blood cell hemagglutination by purified A. archeri lectinnmolaMinimal quantities required for 50% inhibition of binding of AAL to asialo α1-acid glycoprotein-coated plate.

NI, not indicated. Open table in a new tab Those results indicate a preference for β-linked d-Gal. Of the disaccharides, those with terminal nonreducing β-linkedd-Gal were more active than those with terminal nonreducing α-linked d-Gal. Melibiose, raffinose, stachiose, Galα1–3Gal, and 3-fucosyllactose were about 2 times less active thand-Gal. Lactose and other disaccharides with Galβ1–3 and β1–4 linked were slightly more active than d-Gal. There appears to be a significant preference for a GlcNAc subterminal to galactose, because lactose is a somewhat weaker inhibitor than lactosamine. Confirming the requirement for a terminal nonreducing β-linked d-Gal was the fact that Glc-β1–4Gal and Glc-α1–2Gal were inactive. However 3-fucosyllactose was just 2 times less effective than lactose as inhibitor. The best disaccharide inhibitor was thiodigalactose, 180 times more potent thand-Gal. To gain further insight into the carbohydrate binding specificity of AAL we studied the behavior of diverse oligosaccharides and glycopeptides during affinity chromatography on immobilized AAL. Typical profiles are shown in Fig. 7, and the structures examined are given in TableIII. A non-inhibitory sugar such as sialyllactitol (oligosaccharide 11) eluted in the void volume, indicating no interaction at all with the immobilized lectin. Under the conditions used, lactitol (Galβ1–4Glcot) weakly bound to the column and eluted at fraction 7–8 of the buffer wash. By contrast,N-acetyllactosaminitol (Galβ1–4GlcNAcot) was bound to the column and eluted with the 10 mm thiodigalactoside wash, confirming the preference for a subterminal GlcNAc to the terminal β-linked galactose. Galβ1–3GalNAcot was retarded in a manner similar to lactose. Similarly, lacto-N-tetraose (oligosaccharide 4) was only retarded in the column eluting at fraction 7–8, whereas lacto-N-neotetraose (oligosaccharide 3), with a terminal Galβ1–4GlcNAc sequence, was eluted with 10 mmthiodigalactoside. Oligosaccharides lacking the terminal β-linked galactose residue did not bind to the column. Substitution of the subterminal GlcNAc with a fucose residue (oligosaccharides 7–8) or a sialic acid residue (oligosaccharide 10) did not affect the differential recognition but reduced the overall affinity as observed by comparing to the binding profile of compounds 3 and 4. Substitution of the reduced glucitol end group with Fucα1–3 (structure 9) did not affect the binding affinity compared with lacto-N-tetraose.Table IIIStructures of oligosaccharides and their behavior on AAL affinity-chromatography Open table in a new tab When analyzing the binding profile of branched oligosaccharides, it was noticed that they bind to the column more tightly than linear oligosaccharides, as shown for oligosaccharides 12 and 13 containing two Galβ1–4GlcNAc branches that were required to elute 100 mm thiodigalactose. In comparison, the mono-antennary hybrid-type oligosaccharide 14 was eluted with 10 mmthiodigalactoside. The bi-antennary hybrid oligosaccharide 15 required 100 mm thiodigalactose to elute from the column. Similarly, the bi-antennary complex oligosaccharide 16 also required 100 mm thiodigalactose to elute from the column. Introduction of a bisecting GlcNAcβ1–4 in a bi-antennary complex oligosaccharide (structure 17) reduces its binding affinity, as it was eluted from the column with 10 mm thiodigalactose. Cleavage of the linkage of the glycan to the asparagine does not have any effect on the binding, as shown by the profile exhibited by structures 16 and 18. The presence of a fucose in position α1–6 in the core sequence does not alter the binding profile, as seen with oligosaccharides 18 and 21. Interestingly, oligosaccharides 18, 19, and 20, containing different proportions of Galβ1–3GlcNAc and Galα1–4GlcNAc, which are distinguished on linear oligosaccharides (compounds 3 and 4) were also distinguished by the binding profile to the immobilized lectin column; this suggests that the exact linkage pattern determines the binding, contrary to what has been found for Tetracarpidium conophorum lectin (12Sato S.

Yamawaki M. Isobe S. Usui T. Kimura A. Chiba S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1375-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycopeptides bearing three terminal Galβ1–4GlcNAc sequences (structures 22 and 23) showed high affinity for binding to AAL. By contrast, the tetra-antennary structure 24 was eluted from the column with 10 mm thiodigalactoside. Regarding the inhibition by glycoproteins, it was found that consistent with the specificity against terminal nonreducing β-linkedd-gal residues, the best inhibitors of all the glycoproteins tested were the asialo forms, as shown in Table II. No inhibitory effect was shown by the sialylated glycoproteins, confirming an absolute requirement for terminal β-galactosyl residues for interaction with AAL. Porcine thyroglobulin, which contains complex-type glycans terminated predominantly with exposed β-galactosyl residues (15Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Itimura T. Osawa T. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), was a very effective inhibitor. The poor activity of asialofetuin could be related to the poor accessibility of its oligosaccharide chains. Further confirmation of the specificity is shown by the fact that treatment with β-galactosidase of the asialo form of thyroglobulin and α1acid glycoprotein almost abolished the inhibitory activity to the native form of the glycoproteins. The results presented in this report show that the presence of lectins in marine sponges is not as widespread as in other marine organisms (mollusks and crustaceans) or in plants. Interest in marine sponges as sources of novel reagents for cell biology has flourished due to the recent report on the isolation and characterization of the anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) compound niphatevirin fromN. erecta (16O'Keefe B.R.

Recent studies in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae have served to characterize genetically the exchange factor. However, enzyme kinetic studies of the yeast enzyme have been hindered by the lack of sufficient quantities of protein suitable for biochemical analysis. We have purified yeast eIF2B and characterized its catalytic properties in vitro. Values for K m and V max were determined to be 12.2 nm and 250.7 fmol/min, respectively, at 0 °C. The calculated turnover number (K cat) of 43.2 pmol of GDP released per min/pmol of eIF2B at 30 °C is approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than values previously reported for the mammalian factor. Reciprocal plots at varying fixed concentrations of the second substrate were linear and intersected to the left of the yaxis. This is consistent with a sequential catalytic mechanism and argues against a ping-pong mechanism similar to that proposed for EF-Tu/EF-Ts.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Joining of this complex, along with eIF1A and eIF3, with the 40 S ribosomal subunit generates a 43 S preinitiation complex. In cap-dependent translation, this 43 S complex binds at or near the 5′ end of capped mRNAs and “scans” the mRNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction until an AUG initiation codon in proper context is encountered (4Kozak M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Initiation codon recognition is accompanied by hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP, which releases an eIF2·GDP binary complex and leaves Met-tRNAiMet bound at the ribosomal peptidyl site. The 60 S ribosomal subunit then joins, leading to the elongation phase of protein synthesis. The eIF2·GDP binary complex is inactive in initiating protein synthesis and must be converted to the GTP-bound form in order to bind charged initiator tRNA and participate in subsequent cycles of initiation. This recycling process is facilitated in both yeast and mammals by the nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B (5Price N. Proud C.

Furthermore, phosphorylated eIF2 acts as a potent competitive inhibitor of the exchange reaction due to its estimated 150-fold higher affinity for eIF2B (27Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dever T.E. Yang W. Astrom S. Bystrom A.S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6351-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These combined effects lead to an overall reduction of initiation rates in vitro and in vivo. Regulation of the exchange reaction is crucial for maintaining normal homeostasis, as transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with dominant negative PKR isoforms leads to malignant transformation (31Donze O.

This suggests further that regulation of the exchange reaction is required for maintenance of the cell cycle. Other conditions that affect initiation rates appear to be independent of changes in the state of eIF2 phosphorylation and have been suggested to involve a more direct regulation of eIF2B function in vivo. These conditions include treatment of cells in tissue culture with growth factors (33Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S.

Mutations in eIF2B subunit genes have been isolated and characterized in the yeast S. cerevisiae(7Bushman J.L. Asuru A.I. Matts R.L. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

However, insufficient amounts of purified protein were obtained for detailed kinetic analysis. In this report, we describe a procedure for purification of yeast eIF2B from an overexpressing yeast strain. We define basic kinetic parameters for the yeast enzyme using standard Michaelis-Menton analysis, and we have applied these analyses to address the mechanism of the exchange reaction in vitro. The latter is a subject of controversy as a result of two recent studies of mammalian eIF2B (27Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 546-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conclusions based upon these studies have been called into question by Manchester (46Manchester K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in a recent theoretical discussion, thus inviting a renewed study of the kinetic mechanism for the eIF2B-catalyzed reaction. In agreement with Dholakia and Wahba (42Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 546-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our kinetic analysis of the yeast enzyme supports a sequential (ternary complex) mechanism and appears to exclude a substituted enzyme (“ping pong”) mechanism. Biochemical characterization of yeast eIF2B provides a framework for studies that, combined with genetic analysis, will provide for a more complete understanding of the function of eIF2B proteins in eukaryotic organisms. [3H]GDP (10–15 Ci/mmol) andl-[methyl-3H]methionine (70–85 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products; [γ-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals. Protease inhibitors and GDP were purchased from Sigma. Bulk yeast tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was aminoacylated using radiolabeled methionine under conditions that preferentially charge the initiator methionyl-tRNA as described previously (47Erickson F.L.

A Leu− segregant lacking p1305 was obtained after growth on minimal medium supplemented with leucine and then transformed with p2337, a high copyLEU2 plasmid bearing GCD6 andGCD1–6xHis (29Pavitt G.D.

Yeast eIF2 was purified from an overproducing yeast strain as described previously (47Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Strain H2649 was grown in 12 liters of rich medium (YEPD) (51Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 163-167Google Scholar) at 30 °C to anA 600 of 4–8. (It is not necessary to maintain selection based on the nutritional markers present on each plasmid, since each plasmid contains one essential gene that is deleted from the chromosome of the host strain.) All subsequent manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 1 liter of ice-cold distilled de-ionized water (Millipore Corp.), and resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (75 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmNa2EDTA, 12.5 mm 2-ME, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was combined with 175 ml of 0.5-mm acid-washed glass beads in a 350-ml stainless steel chamber (Biospec Products), and cells were lysed in a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products) for 4 cycles of 1 min breaking/1 min rest (chamber continuously cooled in ice/water bath). The lysate was removed, and beads were washed twice with 50 ml of lysis buffer. The pooled lysate was clarified via centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C to pellet ribosomes. The supernatant was discarded, and ribosomes were resuspended in 100 ml of high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 25 μm GDP, 10% v/v glycerol, 6.25 mm 2-ME, and protease inhibitors as described above) and stirred for 30 min on ice. High salt-washed ribosomes were pelleted as above, and the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of P-11/150 Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 25 μm GDP, 6.25 mm 2-ME 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors as described above). Insoluble material was cleared from the dialysate by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a 1.5 × 23-cm phosphocellulose column (40-ml bed volume; P-11, Whatman) that had been pre-cycled as per the manufacturer's specifications. The column was washed with 10 volumes of P-11/150 buffer and eluted using a 500-ml 150 mmto 1 m linear KCl gradient in P-11 buffer. eIF2B eluted between 300 and 720 mm KCl. Fractions containing eIF2B activity were pooled, and imidazole concentration was adjusted to 10 mm. A 15-ml bed volume of pre-washed nickel NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) was added to the pooled fractions, mixed for 1 h on ice, and transferred to a 1.5-cm ID column. Beads were packed by gravity flow (open column) and washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GDP, 10 mm imidazole, 6.25 mm 2-ME, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors as above). Bound protein was eluted with wash buffer containing 200 mm imidazole, and protein-containing fractions were pooled (33 ml) and dialyzed against 2 liters of heparin/150 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 25 μm GDP, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (1 × 12 cm; 10-ml bed volume; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been pre-cycled as per the manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of heparin/300 buffer (heparin buffer with 300 mm KCl), and protein was eluted with a 50-ml linear 300–600 mm KCl gradient in heparin buffer. eIF2B eluted between approximately 460 and 530 mm KCl. Fractions containing eIF2B were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, pooled, and concentrated to a volume of 0.5 ml using a spin concentrator (Centri-Plus 100; Amicon). The protein was applied to a Superdex 200 HR10/30 FPLC gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was pre-cycled as per the manufacturer's instructions. The column was developed with 2 column volumes of sizing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 600 mm KCl, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 25 μm GDP, 1 mm DTT). Fractions containing eIF2B, identified by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol). Protein was stored in small aliquots at −70 °C. All antibodies were polyclonal and were raised in female New Zealand White rabbits. Gcn3p (10Hannig E.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

Purified GST-Gcd2p fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli was used as antigen to raise Gcd2p antibodies. The GST-Gcd2p expression plasmid Ep1059 contained a 1.3-kilobase pairHindIII/EcoRV restriction fragment encoding residues 254–651 at the carboxyl terminus of Gcd2p. TheHindIII site was flush-ended with Klenow enzyme, and the resulting fragment was ligated to SmaI-cleaved pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The insoluble fusion protein was harvested as described previously (53Dieckmann C.L. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1513-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by preparative SDS-PAGE (54Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Rabbits were immunized using 0.5-mg aliquots of protein as described previously (43Hannig E.M. Williams N.P. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Genetics. 1990; 126: 549-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis (29.8:0.2 acrylamide/methylene-bisacrylamide) was as described (43Hannig E.M. Williams N.P. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Genetics. 1990; 126: 549-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as described previously (55Hannig E.M. Cigan A.M. Freeman B.A. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 506-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and developed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Exchange reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mg/ml creatine kinase (as carrier), 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol (exchange buffer), indicated concentrations of eIF2B, eIF2, [3H]GDP, and GDP in a total volume of 120 μl. eIF2 was preincubated with [3H]GDP in a total volume of 96 μl of exchange buffer for 5 min at room temperature, transferred to a 0 °C water bath, and incubated for 15 min. In a second mixture, eIF2B was preincubated (in exchange buffer) with unlabeled GDP as above in a total volume of 20 μl. After the 15-min incubation in ice water, 16 μl of the eIF2 mixture was removed, transferred to 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (exchange buffer with no GDP), and vacuum-filtered through a pre-wetted nitrocellulose filter (0.45 micron; MSI, Westboro, MA; catalogue number E04WP02500). The filter was washed with 5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer, dried, and counted in 5-ml Econofluor2 (Packard Instruments). This was used as the zero time point. Twenty microliters of the eIF2B mixture was added to the remaining eIF2 mixture, and 20-μl aliquots (to correct for the dilution due to addition of eIF2B and GDP) were withdrawn and filtered at various time points and counted as above. All measurements were performed in triplicate; [3H]GDP retained (picomoles) on the filters at each time point varied by less than 5%. Velocities are reported femtomoles of [3H]GDP released per min. All velocities were determined at time points at which no more than 10% of the eIF2·[3H]GDP substrate had been consumed. Nitrocellulose filter-binding assays to determine nucleotide binding by eIF2B were performed as described previously (42Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 546-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We purified yeast eIF2B from a protease-deficient yeast strain that contained the five eIF2B subunit genes on two high copy plasmids. Typical yields from 12 liters of late log phase culture were 500–800 μg of eIF2B protein of approximately 85% purity, as judged by densitometric analysis of stained gels (Fig.1). A supernatant from high salt-washed ribosomes was considered as starting material in the purification table (Table I), since crude extract induced an off-rate from eIF2·[3H]GDP at 0 °C independent of the addition of unlabeled GDP (data not shown). The supernatant was fractionated successively on phosphocellulose, nickel-NTA-agarose, heparin-Sepharose, and Superdex 200, resulting in a 1600-fold enrichment in eIF2B activity. The entire fractionation procedure was completed in 3 days. The purification shown in Table I is typical for three independent purifications. The presence of each of the eIF2B subunits in the final preparation was confirmed by Western blot analysis using subunit-specific antisera (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2–6). The final material was assayed for exchange factor activity using eIF2·[3H]GDP as substrate. Fig. 1 Bdemonstrates that exchange activity required the presence of both eIF2B and unlabeled GDP; no activity was detected in the absence of added unlabeled nucleotide.Table IPurification of eIF2BFraction volumeTotal proteinSpecific activityTotal activityPurification factormlmgHSW ribosome supernatant125733.80.5366.91Phosphocellulose fractions 10–34, 10 ml each, pooled250149.922.53372.845NTA-agarose fractions 4–14, 3 ml each, pooled and dialyzed337.987685.7174Heparin-Sepharose fractions 8–13, 3 ml each, pooled183.2218697.7436Superdex 200 HR 10/30 fractions 15–20, 0.5 ml each, pooled30.79833658.11666Exchange assays were carried out at 0 °C, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in the presence of 400 μmunlabeled GDP. 1 μg of total protein was assayed at each step except for the heparin and Superdex eluates, where 0.5 μg of total protein was assayed.

https://openalex.org/W1993441783,"Abstract Four members of collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are thought to be involved in the semaphorin-induced growth cone collapse during neural development. Here we report the identification of a novel CRMP3-associated protein, designated CRAM forCRMP3-associated molecule, that belongs to the unc-33 gene family. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals that the CRAM gene encodes a protein of 563 amino acids, shows 57% identity with dihydropyrimidinase, and shows 50–51% identity with CRMPs. CRAM appears to form a large complex composed of CRMP3 and other unidentified proteins in vivo. Indeed, CRAM physically associates with CRMP3 when co-expressed in COS-7 cells. The expression of CRAM is brain-specific, is high in fetal and neonatal rat brain, and decreases to very low levels in adult brain. Moreover, CRAM expression is up-regulated during neuronal differentiation of embryonal carcinoma P19 and PC12 cells. Finally, immunoprecipitation analysis of rat brain extracts shows that CRAM is co-immunoprecipitated with proteins that contain protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Taken together, our results suggest that CRAM, which interacts with CRMP3 and protein-tyrosine kinase(s), is a new member of an emerging family of molecules that potentially mediate signals involved in the guidance and outgrowth of axons."
https://openalex.org/W2024125528,"Although crystallographic information is available on several nucleotide-induced states in myosin, little is known about the corresponding structural changes in kinesin, since a crystallographic model is only available for the kinesin:ADP complex. This makes it difficult to characterize at a molecular level the structural changes that occur in this motor through the course of its ATPase cycle. In this study, we report on the production of a series of single tryptophan mutants of a monomeric human kinesin motor domain, which demonstrate nucleotide-dependent changes in microtubule affinity that are similar to wild type. We have used these mutations to measure intramolecular distances in both strong and weak binding states, using florescence resonance energy transfer. This work provides direct evidence that movement of the switch II loop and helix are essential to mediate communication between the catalytic and microtubule binding sites, evidence that is supported as well by molecular modeling. Kinetic studies of fluorescent nucleotide binding to these mutants are consistent with these distance changes, and demonstrate as well that binding of ADP produces two structural transitions, neither of which are identical to that produced by the binding of ATP. This study provides a basis for understanding current structural models of the kinesin mechanochemical cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1498189195,"Abstract Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α(HNF1α)-null mice have enlarged fatty livers and alterations in the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis, catabolism, and transport of fatty acids. Elevations in the expression of genes encoding fatty acid synthetic enzymes (fatty acid synthase and acyl-CoA carboxylase) and peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes (CYP4A3, bifunctional enzyme, and thiolase) were observed in the livers of HNF1α-null mice, whereas hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation gene (medium and short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) expression levels remain unchanged relative to HNF1α-heterozygous controls. An elevation in the levels of fatty acid transporter gene expression was also observed. In contrast, there was a marked reduction of liver fatty acid-binding protein (l-FABP) gene expression in the livers of HNF1α-null mice. Isolation and sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse l-FABP gene revealed the presence of two HNF1α regulatory elements. The results of transient transfection studies indicate that HNF1α is required to trans-activate the expression of the l-FABP promoter. Taken together, these data define a critical role for HNF1α in the pathogenesis of a phenotype marked by fatty infiltration of the liver and in the regulation of the l-FABP gene, the expression of which may have a direct impact on the maintenance of fatty acid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2056909865,"The Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/glucose transporter (vSGLT) is a bacterial member of the SGLT gene family. Wild-type and mutant vSGLT proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and transport activity was measured in intact cells and plasma membrane vesicles. Two cysteine-less vSGLT proteins exhibited sugar transport rates comparable with that of the wild-type protein. Six residues in two regions of vSGLT known to be of functional importance in SGLT1 were replaced individually with cysteine in the cysteine-less protein. Characterization of these single cysteine-substituted vSGLTs showed that two residues (Gly-151 and Gln-428) are essential for transport function, whereas the other four residues (Leu-147, Leu-149, Ala-423, and Gln-425) are not. 2-Aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) blocked Na(+)/glucose transport by only the transporter bearing a cysteine at position 425 (Q425C). MTSEA inhibition was reversed by dithiothreitol and blocked by the presence of both Na(+) and d-glucose, indicating that conformational changes of the vSGLT protein are involved in Na(+)/glucose transport. A split version of vSGLT was generated by co-expression of the N-terminal (N(7)) and C-terminal (C(7)) halves of the transporter. The split vSGLT maintained Na(+)-dependent glucose transport activity. Chemical cross-linking of split vSGLT, with a cysteine in each N(7) and C(7) fragment, suggested that hydrophilic loops between helices 4 and 5 and between helices 10 and 11 are within 8 A of each other. We conclude that the mechanism of Na(+)/glucose transport by vSGLT is similar to mammalian SGLTs and that further studies on vSGLT will provide novel insight to the structure and function of this class of cotransporters."

NO modifies Ca2+ i homeostasis in many types of nonendothelial cells. However, its effect on endothelial Ca2+ i homeostasis at basal and excited states remains unclear. In the present study, to elucidate the effect of NO on basal Ca2+ i, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ i release (IICR) was blocked by expressing an antisense against type-1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors or by microinjecting heparin to individual ECs, and the effects of NO that was released by and diffused from adjacent IICR-intact ECs were recorded. After ATP or bradykinin stimulation, IICR-inhibited ECs showed a marked reduction of basal Ca2+ i, which was abolished byN G-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate pretreatment. The reduction disappeared in sparsely seeded ECs. Exogenous NO gas mimicked the effect of ATP or bradykinin to reduce basal Ca2+ i . Blocking plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), but not Na+-Ca2+ exchange or sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, suppressed the reduction, indicating that the reduction resulted from a NO-dependent potentiation of PMCA. To elucidate the effect of NO on elevated Ca2+ i, ATP-, bradykinin-, or thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ i response in the presence and absence of NO production was compared in adjacent IICR-intact ECs. NO was found to potentiate PMCA, which, in turn, greatly attenuated agonist-evoked Ca2+ i elevation. NO also potentiated Ca2+ influx, which markedly increased the sustained phase of Ca2+ i elevation and possibly NO production. NO did not affect other Ca2+ i -elevating and Ca2+ i -sequestrating components. Thus, NO-dependent potentiation of PMCA is crucial for Ca2+ i homeostasis over a wide Ca2+ i range.

However, in ECs, the effect of NO on Ca2+ i homeostasis including Ca2+ i -elevating and Ca2+ i -sequestrating components remains unclear. On the other hand, most of the published results so far have been obtained by using exogenous NO. The effects on Ca2+ i homeostasis varied among NO donor, NO gas, and endogenous NO, even in the same cell type (19Clementi E. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 266-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Clementi E. Biochem.

In the present study, endogenous NO released from bovine aortic ECs was used to clarify its effects on Ca2+ i homeostasis by a two-step protocol. First, to observe the effect of NO on basal Ca2+ i, IICR response was inhibited in individual ECs by expressing antisense against type 1 IP3 receptor (IP3R1) or by microinjecting heparin. Then the effect of NO that was released by and diffused from adjacent cells on basal Ca2+ i of IICR-inhibited ECs was recorded after ATP or bradykinin (BK) stimulation. As a result, NO caused a marked reduction in basal Ca2+ i . The reduction was a result of a NO-dependent potentiation of Ca2+ i extrusion by PMCA, indicating that this action is crucial for Ca2+ i homeostasis at the resting state. Second, to observe the effect of NO on Ca2+ i dynamics, ATP- or BK-evoked Ca2+ i response in the presence and absence of NO production was compared in adjacent IICR-intact cells. It was found that endogenous NO potentiated PMCA and CCE but did not affect IP3 production, NCX, and SERCA. The potentiation of PMCA greatly attenuated agonist-evoked Ca2+ i elevation, while the potentiation of CCE markedly increased the sustained phase of Ca2+ i elevation and possibly NO production. ECs were enzymatically isolated from bovine aorta, cultured, and identified as described previously (8Wang Y.P. Shin W.S. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Miyamoto M. Shimamoto N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5647-5655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To avoid fluctuation of results due to differences in cell number and growth cycles, cells that reached confluence were subjected to starvation of fetal bovine serum (1%) for 24 h before experiments. Cells of 4–12 passages were used in this study. Three peptides were synthesized according to the amino acid sequence of the cytosolic C-terminal domain of human type 1 (GHPPHMNVNPQQ(C)), type 2 ((C)LGSNTPHVNHHMPPH), and type 3 ((C)RQRLGFVDVQNCISR) IP3 receptors. All of them were synthesized with an additional cysteine at their N- or C-terminal to facilitate coupling reaction. The sequence for IP3R1 is preserved in most species including mouse and Xenopus (40Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The sequences of the corresponding domain in rats are identical except for substitutions of the underlined residues. Antibodies to each of the peptides were purified from rabbit serum by affinity chromatography, and specificities were determined by immunoblotting. After solubilizing the crude homogenate of cultured ECs, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in 6% gel. Samples were then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry blotter. Membranes were incubated with antibodies (× 200) against type 1, 2, or 3 IP3 receptor. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antigens recognized by antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from cultured bovine aortic ECs was used as a template to generate first stand cDNA using an oligo(dT)18 primer. A two-strand DNA fragment of the bovine IP3R1gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cDNA using primers (upper, 5′-catcctaacggaacgagctc-3′; lower, 5′-catagcttaaagaggcagtct-3′). The single fragment obtained was inserted into the pCRTMII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced (Hitachi-5500). The fragment spanned 379 bases (−197 to +182) shared 94% homology with human and 93% homology with mouse in the corresponding domain of the IP3R1 gene. The fragment was then subcloned into pEGFPC1 (CLONTECH), and antisense (pG.IP3R1-AS) or sense (pG.IP3R1-S) orientation of the insert was confirmed by sequencing. To reduce the intercellular distance between transfectants and adjacent untransfected cells and to decrease the transfection rate, we used 100% confluent ECs. Transfection was done in a serum-free medium using a mixture of 1.33 μg of pG.IP3R1-AS and 3.3 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) per 1.2-mm diameter dish. This method resulted in a low transfection rate of 4–6%.pG.IP3R1-S was used as the control. 12–24 h after transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used for experiments 24 h after the medium was changed. HEPES buffer solution, which contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), was utilized as the extracellular medium. The Ca2+-free medium consisted of HEPES buffer solution in which CaCl2 was replaced with EGTA (1 mm). To block PMCA, we employed a buffer consisting of 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.8) (33Furukawa K. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8058-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For blockade of NCX, NaCl in the HEPES buffer was totally replaced with 145 mm choline chloride. For blockade of both PMCA and NCX, La3+ (125 μm) was added to the Na+-free HEPES buffer. After loading fura-2/AM (4 μm, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 40 min, ECs were rinsed and incubated in the Ca2+-free medium. Heparin (M r = 5000; Wako) dissolved in the vehicle (48 mm K2HPO4, 14 mmNa2HPO4, 4.5 mmKH2PO4, and 400 μm unesterified fura-2, pH 6.9) was injected into the perinuclear cytoplasm (Eppendorf 5171 micromanipulator and 5246 transjector, Hamburg). The injection volume into a cell was controlled by varying heparin concentration and injecting pressure (5–80 mmH2O). Within 5 min after the injection, the medium was changed to HEPES buffer solution containing 1 mm Ca2+ and incubated further for 10 min to stabilize the injected cells. ECs were stimulated by ATP, BK, ionomycin (IM), or thapsigargin (TG). All of the four agonists were obtained from Sigma. Ca2+ i responses of transfected and untransfected cells as well as heparin-injected and -uninjected cells in the same observation field were individually analyzed by a two-dimensional Ca2+ i imaging system, as reported previously (8Wang Y.P. Shin W.S. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Miyamoto M. Shimamoto N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20377-20382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absolute Ca2+ i was calculated by comparing the fluorescence ratios at both wavelengths obtained at maximum Ca2+ i (achieved by lysing the cells and saturating fura-2 with Ca2+) and minimum Ca2+ i (achieved by chelating all free Ca2+ with EGTA) using the following equation: Ca2+ i = K d × (R −R min)/(R max −R) × Sf2/Sb2. K d is the dissociation constant (224 nm for fura-2), andR min and R max are theF 340/F 380 ratios of the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms. Sf2/Sb2 is the ratio of the fluorescence values at 380-nm excitation determined at R min and R max, respectively. Mn2+ (0.5 mm)-induced quenching of fura-2 fluorescence was recorded at the excitation wavelength of 360 nm (F 360) for measurement of the cation influx rate. The percentage Mn2+ quenching was obtained from the dynamic F 360 divided by the basalF 360. ECs grown on CELLocatecoverslips (Eppendorf) were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (8Wang Y.P. Shin W.S. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Miyamoto M. Shimamoto N.

All subsequent steps were performed in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline; cells were washed once for 2 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and washed three times (5 min/wash). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by MetoH containing 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min. Nonspecific staining was reduced by incubating with 2% skim milk for 15 min before cells were subjected to the antibody against IP3R1 (× 200) in the presence of 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Then cells were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and peroxidase labeling was carried out with an avidin-biotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories) and visualized by 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine with 0.01% H2O2(42Kawaguchi H. Shin W.S. Wang Y.P. Inukai M. Kato M. Matsuo Y.O. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Kaneda Y. Toyo-oka T. Circulation. 1997; 95: 2441-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ECs were rinsed, and 0.2 ml of each medium was sampled before and 3 min after the administration of BK (500 nm) or 8 min after the addition of TG (1 μm). The amount of NO2−produced was assayed as NO2−, which was determined by colorimetry after the Griess reaction, as reported previously (8Wang Y.P. Shin W.S. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A.

NO gas solution was prepared according to the method described by Shikano (44Shikano K. Long C.J. Ohlstein E.H. Berkowitz B.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 247: 873-881PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 50 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, was placed in a rubber-stoppered glass tube (300 ml). The tube was evacuated under vacuum for 20 min at 25 °C and then flushed with O2-free N2 for 20 min on ice; NO gas (99.99%) was flushed through the tube to saturate the atmosphere, and then the tube was vortexed and placed on ice. After 20 min, atmospheric NO was removed by flushing with N2 for 20 min. Saturated NO in buffer (about 3.3 mm) was diluted into degassed buffer and was freshly prepared immediately before use. ECs were incubated for 1 h in serum-free HEPES buffer solution and then stimulated with 10 μm ATP or 500 nm BK for 15 and 120 s. Then the medium was removed, and an equal volume of ice-cold 15% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid was added. The lysate was collected and centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were extracted three times with 10 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether and neutralized to pH 7.5 with NaHCO3. The remaining IP3 was quantified according to the protocol of the IP3[3H]assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblotting revealed that the antibody against IP3R1 reacted with a single 260-kDa band in the crude homogenate of cultured bovine aortic ECs (Fig.1 A). In contrast, neither type 2 nor type 3 IP3 receptor was detected. A pharmacological study of Ca2+ i dynamics revealed that ECs responded weakly (ΔCa2+ i rise = 11 nm) to caffeine (3–60 mm), with or without ryanodine pretreatment (10–60 μm; data not shown). These results suggest that IICR mediated by IP3R1, but not Ca2+-induced Ca2+ i release, could be the major mechanism involved in Ca2+ i release in ECs. Of the 4–6% of cells that were successfully transfected withpG.IP3R1-AS, 16% showed reduced IP3R1 expression (data not shown), and 12% showed almost complete inhibition of IP3R1expression by immunocytostaining (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, the surrounding untransfected cells and cells transfected withpG.IP3R1-S demonstrated normal staining, indicating that the reduction or complete inhibition of IP3R1 expression was a specific effect ofpG.IP3R1-AS (Fig. 1, Band C). Individual transfectants surrounded by untransfected cells were selected to measure Ca2+ i handling. Of all of thepG.IP3R1-AS transfectants, about 15 and about 12% demonstrated attenuated and complete inhibition of Ca2+ i response to ATP or BK, respectively. The incompletely (data not shown) or completely (Fig. 1 B) inhibited Ca2+ i response is consistent with immunocytostaining results. Ca2+ i dynamics in cells with incomplete IICR inhibition exhibited a delayed and shortened initial Ca2+ i spike, with subsequent Ca2+ i reduction below the basal level after ATP (ΔCa2+ i = 74 ± 5 nm, Fig.2 A) or BK (ΔCa2+ i = 70 ± 7 nm) stimulation. Ca2+ i dynamics in cells with complete IICR inhibition demonstrated not only no initial Ca2+ i spike but also marked Ca2+ i reduction immediately after ATP (ΔCa2+ i = 84 ± 5 nm; Figs.1 B and 2 C) or BK (ΔCa2+ i = 73 ± 4 nm; Fig. 1 B) stimulation. After a wash-out of the first ATP solution followed by a 30-min equilibration period, these Ca2+ i reductions were reproducible by secondary ATP stimulation (Fig. 2, A and C). On the other hand, in pG.IP3R1-S transfectants, ATP and BK induced a normal Ca2+ i response (Fig. 1 C). Our previous study has shown that NO is produced upon stimulation with ATP or BK, and ATP-induced NO production is reproducible and can be blocked by l-NMMA in bovine aortic ECs (8Wang Y.P. Shin W.S. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Miyamoto M. Shimamoto N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5647-5655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ca2+ i reduction with or without NO production was compared in the same cell. Cells that exhibited marked Ca2+ i reduction after the first ATP stimulation were pretreated with l-NMMA (1 mm; Calbiochem) for 30 min. This procedure dramatically attenuated Ca2+ i reduction (ΔCa2+ i = 16 ± 4 nm) at the second ATP stimulation (Figs. 2,B and D), suggesting that Ca2+ i reduction was caused by endogenous NO. However, Ca2+ i reduction was unchanged by pretreatment with indomethacin (25 μm) for 30 min (data not shown). Since IICR inhibition induced bypG.IP3R1-AS is a relatively slow process, the effects of NO were further investigated in ECs where IICR was directly inhibited by heparin. As shown in Fig.3, cell 1, injected with 50 mg/ml of heparin at 10 mm H2O, exhibited an incomplete inhibition of the initial Ca2+ i spike, with a subsequent Ca2+ i reduction below the basal level in response to ATP stimulation. Cell 2 and cell 3, injected with 200 mg/ml of heparin at 20 mm H2O, exhibited a complete inhibition of the initial Ca2+ i spike and, moreover, marked Ca2+ i reduction (ΔCa2+ i = 103 ± 4 nm), similar to that occurring inpG.IP3R1-AS transfectants. The reduction of Ca2+ i in cells with complete IICR inhibition was reproducible in the second ATP stimulation (ΔCa2+ i = 102 ± 4 nm, Fig. 3,B and D). BK also induced Ca2+ i reduction in IICR-inhibited cells (ΔCa2+ i = 98 ± 4 nm). As shown in Fig. 4 A, microinjection of vehicle or heparin (200 mg/ml) had no effect on basal Ca2+ i during a 60-min follow up period. Ca2+ i reduction was induced only by the application of an agonist, and it was unlikely that the nonspecific effects of heparin were involved in the process. Cells that exhibited complete IICR inhibition after the first ATP stimulation were pretreated withl-NMMA for 30 min. This procedure completely abolished the marked Ca2+ i reduction and led to nearly no Ca2+ i rise at the second ATP stimulation (ΔCa2+ i = 2 ± 4 nm; Fig.4 B). When heparin was injected into ECs that were plated at a low density, no Ca2+ i reduction was observed after ATP (Fig. 4 C) stimulation. Furthermore, in sparsely seeded ECs, treatment with NO gas solution (3 μm) induced Ca2+ i reduction in cells injected with heparin (ΔCa2+ i = 38 ± 7 nm) as well as the adjacent IICR-intact cells (ΔCa2+ i = 19 ± 5 nm; Fig. 4 D). These findings demonstrated that the reduction of basal Ca2+ i caused by NO also occurred in heparin-injected cells.Figure 4Basal Ca2+ i level and ATP- and NO gas solution-induced Ca2+ i response in confluent or sparse ECs injected with heparin (200 mg/ml).

https://openalex.org/W1510394141,"Lipopolysacharide (LPS) induced acute phase response (APR) in mouse liver leads to elevation of the low molecular weight CCAAT/Enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) beta isoform, liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein (LIP). In this paper, we investigate the pathway for LIP induction during APR and the role of LIP in regulation of the C/EBPalpha promoter. The 5' region of C/EBPbeta mRNA has been shown to be involved in the regulation of LIP translation. Our data demonstrate that binding of cytoplasmic proteins to the 5' region of C/EBPbeta mRNA is altered in response to LPS administration. One of the major changes is induced binding of a cytoplasmic protein that is immunologically identical to the previously characterized RNA-binding protein CUGBP1. Induction of CUGBP1 binding activity in liver cytoplasm during APR is accompanied by the elevation of CUGBP1 binding activity on polysomes. CUGBP1 immunoprecipitated from livers of LPS-treated mice, but not from normal animals, is capable of inducing LIP translation in a cell-free translation system. The ability of CUGBP1 to induce LIP translation during APR depends on phosphorylation of CUGBP1. We show that elevation of LIP during APR and after partial hepatectomy leads to increased binding of LIP to the C/EBP consensus site found within the mouse C/EBPalpha promoter. This binding correlates with reduction of C/EBPalpha mRNA levels in both biological situations. Co-transfection experiments showed that full-length C/EBPbeta activates the C/EBPalpha promoter, while LIP blocks this activation. Our data suggest that the dominant negative isoform of C/EBPbeta, LIP, down-regulates the C/EBPalpha promoter in liver and in cultured hepatocytes. Because full-length C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta proteins regulate liver proliferation, this function of LIP may be important in liver growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1513581975,"Abstract Endothelialmonocyte-activating polypeptideII (EMAP II) is a novel pro-apoptotic cytokine that shares sequence homology with the C-terminal regions of several tRNA synthetases. Pro-EMAP II, the precursor of EMAP II, is associated with the multi-tRNA synthetase complex and facilitates aminoacylation activity. The structure of human EMAP II, solved at 1.8 A resolution, revealed the oligomer-binding fold for binding different tRNAs and a domain that is structurally homologous to other chemokines. The similar structures to the RNA binding motif of EMAP II was previously observed in the anticodon binding domain of yeast Asp-tRNA synthetase (AspRSSC) and the B2 domain ofThermus thermophilus Phe-tRNA synthetase. The RNA binding pattern of EMAP II is likely to be nonspecific, in contrast to the AspRSSC. The peptide sequence that is responsible for cytokine activity is located, for the most part, in the β1 strand. It is divided into two regions by a neighboring loop."

https://openalex.org/W2017229143,"Adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP, is regulated by its stimulatory and inhibitory GTP-binding proteins, Gs and Gi, respectively. Recently, we demonstrated that besides catalyzing the synthesis of cAMP, type V adenylyl cyclase (ACV) can act as a GTPase-activating protein for Gαs and also enhance the ability of activated receptors to stimulate GTP-GDP exchange on heterotrimeric Gs (Scholich, K., Mullenix, J. B., Wittpoth, C., Poppleton, H. M., Pierre, S. C., Lindorfer, M. A., Garrison, J. C., and Patel, T. B. (1999) Science 283, 1328–1331). This latter action of ACV would facilitate the rapid onset of signaling via Gs. Because the C1 region of ACV interacts with the inhibitory GTP-binding protein Gαi, we investigated whether the receptor-mediated activation of heterotrimeric Gi was also regulated by ACV and its subdomains. Our data show that ACV and its C1 domain increased the ability of a muscarinic receptor mimetic peptide (MIII-4) to enhance activation of heterotrimeric Gi such that the amount of peptide required to stimulate Gi in steady-state GTPase activity assays was 3–4 orders of magnitude less than without the C1 domain. Additionally, the MIII-4-mediated binding of guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) to Gi was also markedly increased in the presence of ACV or its C1 domain. In contrast, the C2 domain of ACV was not able to alter either the GTPase activity or the GTPγS binding to Gi in the presence of MIII-4. Furthermore, in adenylyl cyclase assays employing S49 cyc− cell membranes, the C1 (but not the C2) domain of ACV enhanced the ability of peptide MIII-4 as well as endogenous somatostatin receptors to activate endogenous Gi and to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. These data demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase and its C1 domain facilitate receptor-mediated activation of Gi. Adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP, is regulated by its stimulatory and inhibitory GTP-binding proteins, Gs and Gi, respectively.

Additionally, the MIII-4-mediated binding of guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) to Gi was also markedly increased in the presence of ACV or its C1 domain. In contrast, the C2 domain of ACV was not able to alter either the GTPase activity or the GTPγS binding to Gi in the presence of MIII-4. Furthermore, in adenylyl cyclase assays employing S49 cyc− cell membranes, the C1 (but not the C2) domain of ACV enhanced the ability of peptide MIII-4 as well as endogenous somatostatin receptors to activate endogenous Gi and to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. These data demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase and its C1 domain facilitate receptor-mediated activation of Gi. adenylyl cyclase type V adenylyl cyclase dithiothreitol guanosine 5′-(γ- thio)triphosphate Adenylyl cyclase (AC)1, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP, is regulated by its stimulatory and inhibitory GTP-binding proteins, Gsand Gi, respectively. The binding of hormones or neurotransmitters to their respective receptors that couple to either Gs or Gi results in the activation of these G proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar and 2Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Essentially, receptor-mediated activation of the heterotrimeric G proteins involves the exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit, and this results in the dissociation of the α from βγ subunits (reviewed in Refs. 1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar and 2Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although the activated Gαs subunit can stimulate the activity of all nine forms of membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases that have been cloned and characterized to date (reviewed in Ref. 1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), activated Gαi inhibits only type V, VI, and I adenylyl cyclases (1Sunahara R.K.

Recently, we demonstrated that besides catalyzing the synthesis of cAMP, type V adenylyl cyclase (ACV) has two other functions. First, the enzyme can act as a GTPase-activating protein for Gαs and thereby expedite the termination of signaling via activated monomeric Gαs (5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B. Wittpoth C. Poppleton H.M. Pierre S.C. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Patel T.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Second, adenylyl cyclase enhances the ability of activated β-adrenergic receptor mimetic peptide to stimulate GTP-GDP exchange on heterotrimeric Gs (5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B. Wittpoth C. Poppleton H.M. Pierre S.C. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Patel T.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This latter action of adenylyl cyclase would facilitate the rapid onset of signaling. Interestingly, the regions on adenylyl cyclase that interact with Gαs (6Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) are sufficient to exert the GTPase-activating protein- and guanine nucleotide exchange-enhancing actions of the enzyme (5Scholich K.

Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Our data demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase and its C1 domain increased the ability of an activated muscarinic receptor mimetic peptide to enhance activation of heterotrimeric Gi. These data and our previous results (5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B. Wittpoth C. Poppleton H.M. Pierre S.C. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Patel T.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase regulates receptor-mediated activation of both G proteins that modulate its activity. The recombinant soluble C1-C2 ACV and its subdomains C1 and C2 were expressed in the TP2000 strain of Escherichia coli, which does not contain endogenous AC (7Roy A. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 188: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Beauve A. Boesten B. Crasnier M. Danchin A. O'Gara F. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2614-2621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of protein and cell lysis were performed as described previously (9Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2916-2920Google Scholar), except that the induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) was performed at 23 °C for 15 h. The hexahistidyl-tagged proteins were then purified as described for C1-C2 ACV. Briefly, after cell lysis, the supernatant was batch-bound for 1 h at 4 °C to metal-chelating resin (Talon, CLONTECH), which was equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The resin was then poured into a column and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, followed by a second wash with 10 column volumes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were eluted with 3 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmNaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 125 mmimidazole. The eluted proteins were then applied to a Mono Q 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column and eluted with a 30-ml gradient of NaCl (100–450 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the proteins were pooled and concentrated in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, and 5% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. All of the G protein α subunits were expressed in the JM109(DE3) strain ofE. coli as described by Lee et al. (10Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Gαi1 was coexpressed with yeast proteinN-myristoyltransferase to ensure synthesis of myristoylated G protein as described by Linder et al. (11Linder M.E. Pang I.-H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the recombinant myristoylated Gαi1 protein was achieved by the method of Mumby and Linder (12Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For the purification of the hexahistidyl-tagged, constitutively active Q213L mutant of Gαs (Gαs*) (13Masters S.B. Tyler Miller R. Chi M.-H. Chang F.-H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the harvested cells were lysed as described by Lee et al. (10Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The supernatant was than batch-bound to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After pouring the resin into a column, it was first washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then with 10 column volumes of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm imidazole. Gαs* was eluted with a 50-ml gradient of imidazole (5–250 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The fractions containing Gαs* were pooled, concentrated, exchanged with buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 2.0 mm DTT, and 10 mm potassium phosphate), and applied to a hydroxylapatite HPHT column (Bio-Rad). This column was washed with 2 column volumes of the same buffer and eluted over a 40-ml gradient of increasing potassium phosphate concentration (10–300 mm) in the same buffer. The fractions containing Gαs* were pooled, concentrated, and stored in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT at −80 °C. Bovine brain βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins were purified to homogeneity as described by Mumby et al. (14Mumby S. Pang I.-H. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2020-2026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modifications of Neer et al. (15Neer E.J. Lok J.M. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric Gi was reconstituted by mixing recombinant myristoylated Gαi1 with purified bovine brain βγ subunits (Gαi/βγ molar ratio of 1:5) for 45 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm GDP, and 0.1% Lubrol. Reconstitution was confirmed by a significant decrease in the steady-state GTPase activity of heterotrimeric Gi versus monomeric Gαi under identical experimental conditions. The reconstituted G protein (24.4 nm active Gαi) was than incubated with or without the peptides of interest at 25 °C in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing 100 nm [γ-32P]GTP, 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 μm EDTA, 120 μm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP, which was linear for >30 min, was measured as described previously (16Sun H. Seyer J.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2229-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Essentially, reactions were stopped after 20 min by transferring the assay mixture into tubes containing 0.75 ml of ice-cold 5% (w/v) Norit A in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. After centrifugation, aliquots (500 μl) of the supernatant were decanted for determination of [32P]phosphate content by scintillation counting. Reconstituted Gi protein (12.2 nm active Gαi) was first mixed with 100 nm GTPγS in 25 mmHepes, pH 8.0, for 20 min at room temperature to bind GTPγS to the α subunits that were not bound to Gβγ subunits. Aliquots of this mixture were then incubated with or without the peptides of interest for 60 min at room temperature in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing 100 nm [35S]GTPγS, 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 μm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 150 μm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. In parallel incubations, the binding of 1 μm[35S]GTPγS to the same amount of Gi in the presence of 25 mm MgCl2 was also monitored. The latter provided a measure of the total amount of active Gαi in the heterotrimer. Reactions were stopped, and bound and free [35S]GTPγS were separated as described previously (16Sun H. Seyer J.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2229-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding of [35S]GTPγS was also performed in the presence of excess unlabeled GTPγS as described (16Sun H. Seyer J.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2229-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). S49 cyc− cell membranes were prepared as described by Kassis and Fishman (17Kassis S. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were treated with pertussis toxin (10 μg/ml) for 24 h prior to the isolation of cell membranes. In experiments with MIII-4, membranes (15 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of the proteins of interest and with or without the muscarinic receptor mimetic peptide (MIII-4, Alpha Diagnostics). This incubation (50 μl final volume) also contained 100 nmGTPγS, 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 μm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 150 μm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and a protease inhibitor mixture (5 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). The preincubated S49 cyc− cell membranes were than transferred into the AC activity reactions (100 μl total volume). Assays were performed for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 mmMgCl2 and 10 μm GDPβS as described previously (16Sun H. Seyer J.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2229-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Gαs* (50 nm) or forskolin (33 μm) was used to stimulate enzyme activity. To ensure maximal activation of Gαs*, the G protein was incubated with 100 nm GTPγS at room temperature for 30 min. For adenylyl cyclase activity assays with somatostatin, S49 cyc− cell membranes (10 μg) were preincubated for 2 min at room temperature with or without ACV subdomains in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of somatostatin in a medium (75 μl final volume) containing 3.3 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.13 mm DTT, 0.13 mm EDTA, 13.3 μm GTP, 1.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and a protease inhibitor mixture (6.7 mm benzamidine, 26.6 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 26.6 μg/ml leupeptin, and 26.6 μg/ml aprotinin). The Hepes, DTT, and EDTA were components in the membrane preparations. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 25 μl of 4× AC assay mixture containing forskolin at a final concentration of 100 μm. Assays were performed as described above in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2. Several studies have shown that peptides corresponding to cytosolic domains of receptors can mimic the actions of activated receptors and can stimulate G proteins and subsequently the G protein effectors (5Scholich K.

In this respect, these peptides can be regarded as constitutively active receptors. Okamoto and Nishimoto (19Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 382–400 (RNQVRKKRQMAARERKVTR) in the third cytosolic loop of the M4 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (MIII-4) can efficiently activate Gi. Therefore, in our studies, we employed peptide MIII-4 to activate heterotrimeric Gi. The activation of heterotrimeric G proteins involves exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit. This GTP-GDP exchange is the rate-limiting step in the activation of G proteins and can be conveniently monitored by measuring the steady-state rate of GTP hydrolysis (5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B.

A. 1999; 96: 9551-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and others (4Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Gαi interacts with the C1 domain of ACV and inhibits enzyme activity. Therefore, in initial experiments, we investigated the ability of the C1 and C2 domains of ACV to modulate the steady-state GTPase activity of Gi in the presence of varying concentrations of peptide MIII-4. As demonstrated in Fig.1 A, increasing concentrations of peptide MIII-4 increased the steady-state GTPase activity of Gi. However, in the presence of the C1 domain of ACV, the ability of the peptide to increase steady-state GTPase activity was markedly augmented such that the concentration-response curve was shifted to the left by ∼3–4 log units. In control experiments, in the absence of peptide MIII-4, the C1 domain did not alter the steady-state GTPase activity of Gi (zero peptide concentration in Fig. 1 A), and the C1 domain by itself also did not demonstrate any significant GTPase activity over background levels (data not shown). Moreover, the C2 domain of adenylyl cyclase did not alter the ability of peptide MIII-4 to modulate the steady-state GTPase activity of Gi (Fig. 1 A). Similar to the C1 region, the C2 domain by itself also did not demonstrate any GTPase activity (data not shown). Therefore, these data show that the C1 domain of ACV, but not the C2 region of the enzyme, can augment the ability of the muscarinic receptor mimetic peptide MIII-4 to increase GTP-GDP exchange on Gαi. It is now well established that interactions between the C1 and C2 domains of AC are required to reconstitute enzyme activity, which can be regulated by its modulators (3Wittpoth C. Scholich K.

A. 1997; 94: 2916-2920Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the C1 domain in the context of the adenylyl cyclase molecule can modulate the ability of MIII-4 to increase the steady-state GTPase activity of Gαi, the previously described (3Wittpoth C. Scholich K. Yigzaw Y. Stringfield T.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9551-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B. Wittpoth C. Poppleton H.M.

U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2916-2920Google Scholar), engineered, soluble form of ACV (C1-C2 ACV) was used. The data in Fig.1 B demonstrate that like the C1 domain, in the absence of MIII-4, C1-C2 ACV by itself did not alter the steady-state GTPase activity of Gi. C1-C2 ACV by itself also did not demonstrate any significant GTPase activity over background levels (data not shown). However, similar to the data with the C1 domain, C1-C2 ACV markedly augmented the ability of peptide MIII-4 to stimulate GTPase activity (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the GTP-GDP exchange-enhancing actions of the C1 domain of ACV are also observed when the C2 domain is present to interact with the C1 region. Because the ability of threshold concentrations (0.1 μm) of MIII-4 to activate Gi could be markedly enhanced by the C1 domain and C1-C2 ACV (Fig. 1, A and B), in subsequent experiments, we employed MIII-4 at a concentration (0.1 μm) that by itself does not markedly stimulate the steady-state GTPase activity. Using this concentration of the peptide, we determined that the effects of C1-C2 ACV and its C1 domain to increase the GTPase activity of Gi was concentration-dependent and saturable (Fig. 1 C). On the other hand, in control experiments, the C2 domain of ACV at concentrations up to 2.0 μm did not alter the ability of MIII-4 to activate Gi (Fig. 1 C). Activation of heterotrimeric G proteins also results in increased GTP binding to the Gα subunit (5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B. Wittpoth C. Poppleton H.M. Pierre S.C. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C.

Cell. 1991; 67: 723-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a second approach to monitoring Gi activation, we measured the binding of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS to Gi. These experiments were conducted under conditions (low Mg2+and 100 nm GTPγS) that are optimized to observe peptide-induced increases in the ability of G proteins to bind GTPγS (5Scholich K.

As demonstrated by the data in Fig.2, neither the threshold concentrations of MIII-4 (0.1 μm) nor the addition of C1-C2 ACV or its subdomains (C1 and C2) in the absence of MIII-4 altered GTPγS binding to Gi. However, the presence of both MIII-4 and C1 or C1-C2 ACV increased GTPγS binding to the G protein (Fig. 2). Notably, the C2 domain of ACV, which did not modulate the ability of MIII-4 to stimulate the steady-state GTPase activity of Gi (Fig.1 A), also failed to increase GTPγS binding to Gi (Fig. 2). These data (Fig. 2) demonstrate that C1-C2 ACV and its C1 domain enhance the ability of MIII-4 to activate Gi and to increase GTPγS binding to the G protein. To determine the functional significance of the ability of the C1 domain of ACV to augment the actions of MIII-4 for Giactivation, the experiments depicted in Fig.3 were performed. Essentially, we monitored the ability of the C1 domain of ACV to modulate adenylyl cyclase activity via MIII-4-mediated activation of endogenous Gi in S49 cyc− membranes. S49 cyc− cells do not express Gαs (22Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3333-3340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore provide a convenient model to study Gi activation without interference from Gs activity. Moreover, S49 cyc− cells express predominantly type VI AC (23Premont R.T. Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is inhibited by Gαi (1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 2Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the cyc− membranes were incubated with or without peptide MIII-4 (0.1 μm) in the presence and absence of the C1 or C2 domain of ACV (each at 1.5 μm). AC activity assays were then performed in the presence of forskolin (33 μm). As demonstrated by the data in Fig. 3 A, neither peptide MIII-4 (0.1 μm) nor the C1 domain of ACV altered AC activity in cyc− membranes. However, when both MIII-4 and C1 were present together, the AC activity was inhibited by 50%. To determine if the inhibition of AC activity observed in the presence of MIII-4 and the C1 domain of ACV was due to activation of endogenous Gi, similar experiments were performed in membranes of S49 cyc− cells treated with pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates Gαi, and this modification of the G protein precludes its activation by receptors (24Katada T. Bokoch G.M. Smigel M.D. Ui M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3586-3595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, in membranes from pertussis toxin-treated cells, the inhibition of AC activity in the presence of MIII-4 and the C1 domain was abolished. These data demonstrate that the inhibition of AC activity in the presence of MIII-4 and the C1 domain observed in membranes of S49 cyc− cells not exposed to pertussis toxin is indeed due to activation of endogenous Gi. Furthermore, in experiments with the C2 domain of ACV, AC activity was not affected even when the C2 domain was present along with MIII-4 (Fig.3 B). These data show that the C1 (but not the C2) domain of ACV enhances the ability of MIII-4 to activate endogenous Gi in cyc− cell membranes and to inhibit AC activity. The conclusion noted above was further substantiated by experiments in which AC activity in cyc− cell membranes was stimulated with the constitutively active, GTPase-deficient mutant of Gαs (Q203L, Gαs*) (Fig.4, A and B). Gα2 was bound to the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS prior to experimentation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Therefore, changes in AC activity in cyc− membranes cannot be attributed to alterations in the active form of Gαs*. As shown in Fig. 4 A, basal AC activity in cyc−cells was very low and markedly stimulated by Gαs*. Similar to the findings with forskolin (Fig. 3 A), neither C1 nor threshold concentrations of peptide MIII-4 (0.1 μm) by themselves significantly altered AC activity that was stimulated by Gαs* (Fig. 4 A). However, the combination of MIII-4 and C1 inhibited AC activity by 60% (Fig. 4 A). This effect was specific for the C1 domain of ACV since the C2 domain of ACV by itself or in combination with MIII-4 failed to alter AC activity in cyc− cells (Fig. 4 B). That the inhibition observed in Fig. 4 A was due to activation of endogenous Gi was demonstrated by the findings that when GTPγS was omitted from the preincubations of S49 cyc− membranes with or without MIII-4 and/or the C1 domain, the inhibition shown in Fig.4 A was not observed (data not shown). To determine if the C1 region of ACV could augment inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity mediated by activation of endogenous receptors, experiments were performed with S49 cyc− cell membranes. To complement the experiments with the muscarinic receptor mimetic peptide MIII-4, the ability of the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol to inhibit the activity of adenylyl cyclase in cyc− membranes was assessed. However, carbachol at concentrations up to 1 mm did not inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cyc−cells (data not shown). Therefore, it would appear that cyc− cells do not express muscarinic receptors. Because Katada et al. (24Katada T. Bokoch G.M. Smigel M.D. Ui M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3586-3595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that somatostatin via Gi activation inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity in cyc− cell membranes, further experiments were performed with somatostatin. As shown in Fig. 5, in the absence of ACV subdomains, somatostatin inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Addition of the C2 domain of ACV did not alter the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by somatostatin (Fig. 5). However, the C1 domain of ACV shifted the somatostatin concentration-response curve to the left so that the inhibition of enzyme activity at lower concentrations of somatostatin was enhanced in the presence of the C1 domain (Fig. 5). In control experiments, the C1 domain alone, in the absence of somatostatin, did not inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity (Figs. 5; also see Figs. 3 and 4). Moreover, in membranes of cyc− cells treated with pertussis toxin, neither somatostatin nor the combination of somatostatin and C1 domain altered adenylyl cyclase activity (data not shown). These data (Fig. 5) demonstrate that the paradigm that we have described employing a reconstituted Gi protein and a muscarinic receptor mimetic peptide (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) is applicable to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by endogenous Gi-coupled receptors. Thus, in the presence of the C1 region of ACV, lower amounts of agonist and therefore lower amounts of active receptors are required to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Taken together, the data in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 demonstrate that ACV and its C1 subdomain, which interacts with Gαi (3Wittpoth C. Scholich K. Yigzaw Y. Stringfield T.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9551-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

These findings, along with our previous demonstration that the C2 domain of AC, which interacts with Gαs, enhances the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of the β2-adrenergic receptor mimetic peptide (βIII-2) for Gs (5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B. Wittpoth C. Poppleton H.M. Pierre S.C. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Patel T.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), indicate that the novel concept of AC modulating the ability of receptors to increase GTP-GDP exchange on G proteins is applicable to both G proteins that regulate its activity. In this context, it should be noted that Mukhopadhyay and Ross (25Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have shown that phospholipase Cβ does not alter receptor-mediated GTP-GDP exchange on Gq. Because our experiments in cyc− membranes with MIII-4 and activation of endogenous somatostatin receptors are consistent with the in vitro reconstitution data experiments, it is unlikely that the differences between phospholipase Cβ (25Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and AC (Ref. 5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B. Wittpoth C. Poppleton H.M. Pierre S.C. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Patel T.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and this study) are related to the use of lipid vesicles and/or full-length receptor (25Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) versus the use of receptor mimetic peptides and reconstitution without lipid vesicles (Ref. 5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B. Wittpoth C. Poppleton H.M. Pierre S.C. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Patel T.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and this study). More likely, it is possible that different effectors modulate the activity of their respective G proteins in different manners. Additional studies in the future with various effectors of heterotrimeric G proteins should help resolve this possibility. One of the most interesting aspects of our studies is that the C1 domain of ACV, which interacts with Gαi, increases the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of a receptor mimetic peptide that activates Gi, whereas the C2 region of ACV, which interacts with Gαs, increases the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of receptors that couple Gs (5Scholich K. Mullenix J.B. Wittpoth C. Poppleton H.M. Pierre S.C. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Patel T.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would appear that the interaction of the ACV domains with their respective Gα subunits in the context of the heterotrimer is important for augmenting the signals transduced from receptors to the G proteins that they are coupled with. We are deeply indebted to the following individuals who supplied several of the reagents: Dr. Alfred G. Gilman for the Gαs cDNA, Dr. Randall Reed for the Gαi1 cDNA, Dr. Wei-Jen Tang for the TP2000 strain ofE. coli; Dr. Jeffrey I. Gordon for providing the plasmid pBB131 encoding S. cerevisiae N-myristoyltransferase, and Dr. Yoshihiro Ishikawa for the canine ACV cDNA."

This effect was not mimicked by 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, another phorbol ester, which is inactive with respect to protein kinase C activation, and was prevented by the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide. TPA also caused a rise of [Ca2+] i in Fura-2-loaded PC12 cells, and again this was not mimicked by 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate and could be blocked by bisindolylmaleimide. TPA-evoked secretion was entirely dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and was fully abolished by nifedipine, as were TPA-induced rises of [Ca2+] i . Resting membrane potential, monitored using perforated patch recordings, was unaffected by TPA. However, a small (6–8 mV) hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of Ca2+ channel currents (determined using whole-cell patch clamp recordings) was induced by TPA, and this could be fully prevented by nifedipine. In contrast to results with depolarizing stimuli, which evoke exocytosis because of Ca2+ influx throughN-type channels in these cells, the present results indicate that protein kinase C activation leads directly to quantal catecholamine secretion in the absence of depolarizing stimuli via a selective shift in the activation of L-type Ca2+channels."
https://openalex.org/W2056096825,"To understand the cell signaling of protein kinases, it is essential to monitor their activity in each of the subcellular compartments. Here we developed a method to visualize the activities of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and nucleus, separately, by utilizing targeted phosphorylation motifs and phosphorylation-specific antibodies. This approach was used to monitor the activities of post-synaptic CaMKII in cultured hippocampal neurons. Strong stimulation of the neurons by N-methyl-d-aspartate led to global activations of CaMKII in the cell bodies and dendrites. On the other hand, weak stimulation by removal of Mg(2+) block of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors induced CaMKII signaling localized within single dendritic spines. Post-synaptic CaMKII is thought to modify synaptic efficiency. The present data for the first time demonstrate the activation of CaMKII localized within single dendritic spines and are consistent with the notion that synaptic efficiency is modified by CaMKII in single or multiple spine level depending on the strength of receptor activation."

In this paper, we characterized the Ca(2+) binding property of p26olf, examined the precise localization in the frog olfactory epithelium, and searched for the possible target proteins of p26olf. By flow dialysis experiments using (45)Ca, p26olf was suggested to bind approximately 4 Ca(2+). Circular dichroism measurement showed that binding of Ca(2+) to p26olf induces an increase in the apparent content of both alpha-helix and beta-sheet with an apparent K(d) value of 2.4 micrometer. Electron microscopic observation disclosed p26olf immunoreactivity in the cilia, dendritic knob, and dendrite of olfactory receptor cells. Blot overlay analysis and affinity purification of p26olf-binding proteins showed that p26olf binds to a frog beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-like protein in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These results suggested that p26olf has some roles in the olfactory transduction or adaptation."

The level of PP-1G was depleted by transfection with an inducible antisense-oriented PP-1G gene. Western blot analysis of the PP-1G-depleted cell line revealed a >90% depletion of PP-1G protein and a 45% reduction in cellular PP-1 activity and abolished the ability of L6 myoblasts to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes. PP-1G-depleted cells also exhibited a marked reduction in the expression of the differentiation marker myogenin as well as creatine kinase. After 7 days in culture, PP-1G-depleted cells sustained myoblast levels of inhibitor of differentiation-2, whereas control L6 cells had a severely lower inhibitor of differentiation-2 level and progressed into myotubes. Myoblasts were unable to exit the cell cycle, as measured by the impaired induction of p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a >2-fold increase in DNA synthesis, and elevated levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb).

Cell. 1994; 78: 15-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 2Edmundston D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this family of proteins, including MyoD, myogenin, myf-5, MRF-4, and the myocyte enhancer binding factor 2, share highly conserved domains that have the ability to both bind DNA and to form heterodimers (3Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Binding of these basic helix-loop-helix proteins to E2a gene products promotes myogenic activity by increasing their affinity for specific DNA sequences located in control regions of muscle-specific genes (4Chakraborty T. Brennan T.J. Li L. Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3633-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Id2,1 a member of the helix-loop-helix family present in proliferating cells, appears to preferentially bind E2a and thereby prevent myogenic activity (5Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Myogenic activity is also blocked by other agents such as high concentrations of mitogens, fetal bovine serum, basic fibroblast growth factor 2, transforming growth factor-β, and wortmannin, a PI3-kinase inhibitor (6Brennan T.J.

Furthermore, recent studies with constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of PI3-kinase, as well as Akt (protein kinase B), one of the downstream targets of PI3-kinase, suggest that PI3-kinase directed myogenic signaling requires Akt (9Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14179-14183Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fujiki H. Weintraub H. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15140-15145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as other studies using microinjection of affinity purified PP-1 catalytic subunit (PP-1C) antibodies (13Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggested an essential role for PP-1 in the regulation of mammalian cell division and mitotic exit. Moreover, PP-1Cassociates with retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and therefore has been implicated in the regulation of its activation status (14Puntoni F. Villa-Moruzzi E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Rubin E. Tamrakar S. Ludlow J.W. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nelson D.A. Krucher N.A.

PP-1 holoenzyme exists in vivo as a complex with the catalytic subunit PP-1C attached to regulatory subunits that target the enzyme to particular subcellular locations, modify its substrate specificity, and regulate enzymatic activity (17Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Thus, PP-1C is found associated with glycogen particles (PP-1G), sarcoplasmic reticulum (PP-1SR), myofibrils (PP-1M), the cytosolic inhibitor-2 protein (PP-1I), and the nucleus (PP-1N) through a set of nuclear inhibitor proteins (18Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the intracellular distribution of PP-1 activity, via its regulatory subunits, may be an important aspect of its regulation. Although PP-1 has long been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and myogenesis in mammalian cells, the form of PP-1 that participates in these processes and the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies from this laboratory have shown that the PP-1G subunit is expressed in L6 cells upon fusion and is absent in proliferating L6 myoblasts (19Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of insulin on PP-1 activity parallels the gradual appearance of the PP-1G subunit in cells at fusion. Modulation of PP-1G plays an important role in insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and glucose transport (20Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whether PP-1G subunit expression is essential for terminal differentiation of L6 cells is unknown. These results, together with the above studies indicating a potential role for PP-1 in cell cycle arrest and myogenesis, prompted us to further explore the role of PP-1G, a known regulator of PP-1 in myogenesis.

All other reagents including those for creatine kinase activity were purchased from Sigma. Porcine insulin was a kind gift from the Eli Lilly Co. (Indianapolis, IN). Antibody against PP-1G was generated as described previously (19Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spontaneously fusing rat skeletal muscle cell line L6, a kind gift from Dr. Amira Klip (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), was used as the parent strain for all transfection experiments. The LacSwitchTM mammalian expression system vector p3′SS was initially transfected into L6 myoblasts with LipofectAMINETM and selected with 1.0 mg/ml hygromycin B to confer lac repressor expression in the parent strain used for the antisense construct (20Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that a single clone expressing the highest level of lac repressor protein was used for subsequent construction to minimize clonal variability. PP-1G depletion was accomplished by inserting thePP-1 G gene in the antisense orientation within the expression vector pOPI3 and selected with 2.0 mg/ml G418. All transfections were performed as described previously (20Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Independent clones were picked up with cloning discs and screened for the absence of PP-1G protein expression by immunoblot analysis of cell extracts prepared from 10–14-day-old cells using PP-1Gantibody as described under “Immunoblot Analysis,” below. Screening with PP-1G antibody led to the identification of three clones out of 200 G418 resistant clones that lacked PP-1Gprotein upon induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Clone R14, which exhibited a >95% depletion of PP-1G protein, was used for all of the experiments. Control cells (referred to herein as L6) were transfected with the empty expression vector. Transfectionper se did not affect the extent of differentiation of L6 cells. In order to further ensure that the observed effects were due to the depletion of PP-1G protein, the PP-1 G gene was restored to PP-1G-depleted cells. Because our depletion strategy was based upon inducible antisense technology, restoration of PP-1G into this strain was not possible. Therefore, we created a PP-1 G knockout strain by homologous recombination with positive-negative selection and restored PP-1G into these cells by a method of transfection similar to that described above. Briefly, PP-1Gdeletions were constructed in L6 cells by inserting the gene for hygromycin resistance within the PP-1 G gene and adding a thymidine kinase gene at the 3′ end of the PP-1Gto yield plasmid pKO/PP-1G′-Hygro-′PP-1G-thymidine kinase. Clones resistant to 1 mg/ml hygromycin B and able to grow in 2 μm ganciclovir were screened for the lack of PP-1G protein expression by immunoblot analysis of cell extracts using PP-1G antibody. The PP-1 G gene was restored in this knockout cell line by transfection with vector pcDNA3/FLAG/PP-1G, which contains thePP-1 G gene in the sense orientation, and the screening for stable clones was based upon the appearance of the epitope-tagged FLAG/PP-1G fusion protein (21Ragolia L. Duddy N. Begum N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1773-1783PubMed Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope was attached in-frame to the amino-terminal end ofPP-1 G gene to ensure novel PP-1Gexpression. All constructions were confirmed by a combination of restriction analysis, polymerase chain reaction, Southern analysis, and automated sequencing analysis using BigDye® in an ABI PrismTM model 373 sequencing apparatus. Wild-type L6 cells were grown and maintained in α-MEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotics in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfected cells were maintained as above with the addition of 150 μg/ml hygromycin B and 400 μg/ml G418. Transfected cells carrying the PP-1 G antisense construct were induced with 1.0 mm IPTG from day 3 of culture to induce the expression of PP-1G antisense mRNA. Unless otherwise stated, cells were serum-starved for 15 h in serum-free α-MEM for all experiments and used after 3, 5, and 7 days in culture. Serum-starved cells were fed with serum-free medium containing 5 mm glucose and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Identical dishes in triplicate were incubated in the absence and presence of insulin (10 nm) for 10 min. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by extraction with PP-1 extraction buffer as detailed in our earlier publications (19Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PP-1 activity was determined using 32P-labeled glycogen phosphorylase a as a substrate in the presence of 2.0 nmokadaic acid. At this concentration, okadaic acid inhibits only PP-2A, and the remaining activity represents the contribution of PP-1 (19Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Nikon inverted microscope fitted with a Sony DXC-9000 video camera at × 10 magnification was used to document all morphological studies. Cells were generally photographed at days 3, 5, and 7 and digitally imported into Adobe® Photoshop® 5.0. Creatine kinase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically using a diagnostic kit available from Sigma. Briefly, day 3, 5, and 7 cultures grown in 60-mm dishes were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times and extracted in 100 μl of muscle creatine kinase buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and pepstatin A. The cell suspension was sonicated twice at 4 °C and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 4 min. Typically, 50 μl of extract was assayed as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the activity was expressed as units/mg. A unit of creatine kinase activity was defined as (ΔA 340 units/min · 1000)/6.22 (extinction coefficient). L6 wild-type andPP-1 G antisense R14 cells were grown for 3, 5, and 7 days in six-well plates and were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm glucose, antibiotics, and IPTG (1.0 mm) for 24 h followed by treatment with and without medium containing 2% FBS for 15 h. The cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) for 3 h. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was removed, and the cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times followed by one wash with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were solubilized by the addition of 200 μl of a 0.1% SDS/0.1 n NaOH solution. After a 10-min incubation, 100 μl of cell lysate was added to 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Instagel, Packard), and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (22Begum N. Song Y. Reinzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation was expressed as dpm/mg of protein/h. Culture plates (100 mm) were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of 200 μl of cell lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2.0 mm EDTA, 2.0 mm EGTA, 1.0% SDS, 1.0 mm benzamidine, 2.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and pepstatin A. The plates were scraped, and the cell lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. Typically, 20–30 μg of protein was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.1% bromphenol blue, 1.0 m NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 50% glycerol, and 10% SDS; boiled for 5 min; and loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 1280-1285Crossref Scopus (207218) Google Scholar, 24Begum N.

The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with the proper antibody followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and subsequent autoradiography. The intensity of the signal was quantitated by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms. Protein content of cell extracts was determined with bicinchoninic acid (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fugimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18645) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as means ±S.E., and the Student's t test or analysis of variance was used to evaluate significance. In this study, we examined the effects of PP-1Gdepletion on the process of myogenesis using PP-1 G antisense mRNA expression. PP-1G protein was depleted from the insulin-sensitive rat skeletal muscle cell line L6 by transfection with an IPTG inducible vector carrying thePP-1G gene in the antisense orientation as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” As demonstrated in our earlier publications (19Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PP-1Gimmunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts isolated from L6 cells revealed no expression of the 160-kDa PP-1G protein at day 3 (Fig. 1). At day 5, however, extracts isolated from L6 began to express PP-1G protein, with maximal expression observed at day 7. PP-1 G antisense cells (clone R14), however, had virtually no PP-1G expression in IPTG-induced cells after day 5 and only about 5% of the PP-1G found in L6 cells after day 7 (Fig.1). Noninduced R14 cells also exhibited reduced PP-1Glevels due to leaky expression from the LacSwitchTM system occasionally observed (20Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Gossen M. Bonin A.L. Bujard H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 471-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). R14 was used as a representative clone throughout this study, but similar results were observed with two otherPP-1 G antisense clones. In order to examine the impact of PP-1G depletion on cellular PP-1 enzymatic activity, extracts isolated from 7-day-old cells were assayed for PP-1 enzymatic activity. IPTG-induced R14 cells exhibited a 32% decrease in cellular PP-1 activity in the basal state when compared with wild-type L6 cells (Fig.2). In addition, PP-1G-depleted cells exhibited a complete lack of insulin-stimulated PP-1 enzymatic activity when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2). Wild-type L6 myoblasts grown in α-MEM containing 2% FBS formed multinucleated myotubes after 7 days in culture (Fig.3). In contrast, PP-1G-depleted cells lined up but failed to differentiate into myotubes even after 7 days in culture (Fig. 3). This lack of differentiation was observed until the cells eventually fall apart after approximately 18 days. Because PP-1G-depleted cells did not appear to be fusing into myotubes, the rate of cell growth and proliferation was compared between wild-type and PP-1G-depleted cells by measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. As seen in Fig. 4, R14 cells exhibit a >2-fold increase in DNA synthesis when compared with L6 cells over all seven days in the basal as well as serum-induced conditions. In wild-type L6 cells, differentiation was accompanied by a progressive decrease in the DNA synthesis rate in both basal and serum-induced cells from day 3 through day 7 of growth. However, the difference in growth rate persisted over the entire 7-day period studied in R14 cells even though these cells exhibited a considerable reduction in DNA synthesis in 7-day-old cells when compared with day 3 cells, but the rate of serum-induced DNA synthesis in 7-day-old cells was as high as 3-day-old proliferating L6 cells. In conjunction with differences observed in the growth rate of R14 cells the activity of the myotube-specific marker, creatine kinase, was assayed and observed to be markedly reduced. As shown in Fig.5, L6 cells exhibit an approximately 10-fold increase in creatine kinase activity during the transition from a fusing myoblasts at day 5 to fully differentiated myotubes at day 7. In contrast, R14 cells exhibit very little creatine kinase activity in day 5, with no increase in activity up to the 7 days of culture studied (Fig. 5). We next examined the effect of PP-1G depletion on the expression of the muscle-specific differentiation markers myogenin, Id2, and p27Cdk inhibitor. Myogenin expression, although absent at day 3 of growth, was observed in wild-type L6 cells after 5 days of growth, with comparable levels observed after day 7 (Fig.6 A). Although myogenin also begins to appear after day 5 in R14 cells, the level is approximately 10-fold less than L6 levels. This decreased myogenin level is maintained in IPTG-induced PP-1 G antisense R14 cells, even after 7 days in culture (Fig. 6 A). The level of Id2, an inhibitor of differentiation, although similar in both cell types at day 3, remained expressed in PP-1G-depleted cells (IPTG-induced R14) even after day 7 and dropped to nearly 30% of day 3 levels in wild-type L6 cells (Fig. 6 B). The levels of Id1 did not change during myogenesis in L6 cell line (data not shown). The p27Cdk inhibitor, which appears in L6 during myogenesis, was approximately 25% of wild-type in PP-1G-depleted cells studied at days 5 and 7 (Fig. 6 C). The levels of p21 did not change during myogenesis in L6 cells (data not shown). The retinoblastoma gene (Rb) encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that functions as a critical negative regulator of mammalian cell cycle progression (27Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Kim P.S. Cheung W.L. Lasar A.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The function of phospho-Rb appears to be controlled by the phosphorylation status of the protein, and dephosphorylation via PP-1 appears to activate the protein causing cell cycle arrest (15Rubin E. Tamrakar S. Ludlow J.W. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nelson D.A. Krucher N.A. Ludlow J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4528-4535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the level of Rb and phospho-Rb in both L6 and R14 cells. In proliferating L6 and antisense R14 cells at day 3 of growth, the level of phospho-Rb is comparable both in the basal state and after stimulation by FBS (Fig.7). Whereas L6 cells show responsiveness to FBS in terms of Rb phosphorylation at day 3, they gradually lose the susceptibility to phosphorylation at days 5 and 7, despite an increase in the content of Rb protein. This is in contrast to R14 cells, which maintain elevated basal and serum-induced phospho-Rb levels at days 5 and 7. Induction of R14 cells with IPTG did result in a considerable increase in basal phospho-Rb levels at days 5 and 7 (Fig. 7, compare lane 8 versus lane 7 and lane 14 versus lane 13). It should be noted that L6 cells exhibited a gradual increase in Rb protein levels at day 5, with the highest expression observed at day 7. R14 cells exhibited an increase in Rb protein levels only at day 7. However, the content of Rb protein was lower than that of L6 cells (Fig. 7). To further confirm that PP-1G indeed has a regulatory function in myogenesis, PP-1G expression was restored in a PP-1G knockout cell line created by homologous recombination (see under “Experimental Procedures”) by transfection with a recombinant PP-1 G gene carrying a FLAG epitope attached to the 5′-end of the PP-1G gene in order to ensure novel PP-1G expressionversus a return of endogenous PP-1G expression. The resulting strain, FLAG/PP-1G, had its cellular morphology and fusion patterns restored to normal, as shown in Fig.8 A and expressed PP-1G protein and myogenin at levels comparable to wild-type L6 myotubes at day 7, as well as diminished Id2 protein expression when compared with PP-1G knockout cells (Fig.8 B). This was accompanied by up-regulation of creatine kinase activity (Fig. 8 C). Furthermore, up-regulation of endogenous PP-1G levels by induced stable PP-1Goverexpression also resulted in 5-fold higher myogenin levels (Fig.8 D) and accelerated myotube formation (data not shown) when compared with control wild-type cells. Earlier studies by Kim et al. (12Kim S.J. Kim K.Y. Tapscott S.J. Winokur T.S. Park K. Fujiki H. Weintraub H. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15140-15145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the activities of MyoD and myogenin are inhibited by phosphorylation. To examine whether PP-1G depletion is accompanied by excessive myogenin phosphorylation, we performed immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from 32P-labeled 7-day-old cells using myogenin antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 9, both clone R14 and PP-1G knockout cells exhibit a marked increase in myogenin phosphorylation when compared with wild-type L6 and FLAG-PP-1G-expressing cells, which exhibit very little myogenin phosphorylation despite an increase in myogenin content. To further understand the nature of PP-1G control of myogenesis, we examined the subcellular localization of PP-1C by Western blot analyses of cytosolic and purified nuclear fractions prepared from 7-day-old FLAG-PP-1G andPP-1 G knockout cells. As shown in Fig.10, PP-1G was absent in the cytosolic fractions of FLAG-PP-1G expressing cells but was present both in the cell extracts as well as in the nuclear fraction. Knockout cells were negative for PP-1G protein expression in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. The contents of the β isoform of PP-1C in the extracts and the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were not different between the knockout and FLAG-PP-1G expressing cells. However, it should be noted that the nuclear fractions obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation are not pure due to cross-contamination, thereby making it very difficult to observe subtle changes in PP-1Ccontent in the nuclei of knockout cells. In this study, we have demonstrated a unique role for PP-1G, one of the major regulatory subunits of PP-1, in the regulation of terminal differentiation in L6 cells, using a transfected cell line expressing PP-1 G antisense mRNA, as well as a recombinant PP-1 G knockout cell line with very low levels of expression of this targeting subunit. Reinsertion of an epitope-tagged recombinant PP-1G into the knockout cell line restores PP-1 enzymatic activity, the expression of myogenic markers, terminal differentiation, and cell morphology. This relationship between PP-1G and myogenesis is in addition to the well established roles of this targeting subunit in glycogen synthesis and glucose transport (19Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Ragolia L. Duddy N. Begum N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1773-1783PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dent, P., Lavoinne, A., Nakielny, S., Caudwell, F. B., Watt, P., and Cohen, P. Nature348, 302–308Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the coincidence of PP-1G protein expression and the entrance of L6 myoblasts into differentiation (19Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Appearance of the PP-1G subunit begins at approximately day 5 of growth, when cell fusion begins, and levels off after 7 days. These observations, together with the present findings, suggest that PP-1Gexpression, together with the activation of PP-1Gholoenzyme, may play an important role in coupling the irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle with phenotypic terminal differentiation. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a role for one of the regulatory subunits of PP-1 in the control of myogenesis. Earlier studies have indicated that okadaic acid a potent inhibitor of PP-1 and PP-2A inhibited myogenesis in C2C12 cells by blocking the expression of the myogenic determination genes MyoD1and myogenin but inducing the expression of Id1, the inhibitor of differentiation (9Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14179-14183Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, PP-1G appears to promote myogenesis by augmenting the expression of the myogenic determination gene, myogenin, which in turn induces the expression of p27Cdk inhibitor leading to inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases as depletion of the PP-1 G gene blocked the expression of myogenin and p27 cdk inhibitor. PP-1G depletion also results in an increase in the phosphorylation status of myogenin, and this may decrease its activity, as suggested by earlier studies by Kim et al. (12Kim S.J. Kim K.Y. Tapscott S.J. Winokur T.S. Park K. Fujiki H. Weintraub H. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15140-15145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, PP-1G depletion may lead to the posttranslational modification of other transcription factors, such as c-Jun or Id, which in turn inhibits the activity of myogenin by direct binding leading to the disruption of the positive myogenin/MyoD autoregulatory feedback loop. Further in-depth studies are needed to establish the role of the other myogenic transcription factors in this model system. Additionally, in another pathway of myogenic signaling, PP-1G also appears to regulate the phosphorylation and thus activation status of Rb protein, as depletion of this PP-1Gsubunit is accompanied by elevated levels of phospho-Rb, leading to its inactivation. Our results indicate that PP-1G depletion increased cell growth by activating PI3-kinase and its downstream target Akt; therefore, any myogenic defects observed in PP-1G-depleted cells may not be due to defective PI3-kinase/Akt signaling. Additional determinant factors must come into play that modulate signaling pathways involved in terminal differentiation. PP-1G and/or holoenzyme complex may be one of the determining factors for myogenic signaling for several reasons. First, PP-1G depletion severely impaired the induction of myogenin expression, the marker for L6 skeletal muscle cell differentiation, and completely inhibited terminal differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. This defect is accompanied by (i) persistent levels of Id2, which is normally down-regulated as the cells start to form myotubes, and (ii) impaired induction of the p27Cdk inhibitor. Additionally, the somewhat elevated Id2 protein levels observed in PP-1G-depleted cells may cause further inactivation of the limited amount of myogenin by forming heterodimers and thereby silence its transcriptional activity. It is known that Id proteins bind E2a with greater affinity than myogenin, resulting in the inhibition of DNA binding and biological activities of E2a. In addition, PP-1G-depleted cells exhibit an increase in myogenin phosphorylation status, causing inactivation of myogenin. A second consequence of myogenin depletion and inactivation is that the expression of p27Cdk inhibitor is blocked. This may cause the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases and inactivation of Rb protein, due to increased phosphorylation, and therefore may impair cells from exiting from mitosis. Finally, replacement of the FLAG-epitope-tagged PP-1G subunit into knockout cells restored basal PP-1 catalytic activity, its stimulation by insulin, expression of myogenin, down-regulation of Id2, expression of p27Cdk inhibitor, reduction in the levels of phospho-Rb, and the ability to form myotubes along with concomitant restoration of creatine kinase activity. These results confirm that the defects observed in terminal differentiation in PP-1G knockout cells were due to the lack of an active PP-1 holoenzyme and not to nonspecific events. Previous studies by Fernandez et al. (13Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have shown that PP-1 catalytic subunit gets localized to the nucleus as cells progress from G1 to G2/M phase in rat 1 fibroblasts. No evidence, however, exists on the processes regulating this increase in the nuclear localization of PP-1. The present study adds a new dimension to the role of PP-1 in muscle cell differentiation via its glycogen/SR associated regulatory subunit in L6 cells. It is known from several studies that withdrawal from the cell cycle during myogenesis is accompanied by a decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase activity that is correlated with marked induction of the p21/p27Cdk inhibitors (29Guo K. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A reduction in PP-1 catalytic activity resulting from depleted PP-1G may lead to impaired dephosphorylation and inactivation of Cdc25 phosphatase. As a consequence, Cdc2 kinase remains active. It is tempting to speculate that PP-1G may carry the catalytic subunit of PP-1 to the nucleus during the cell cycle and allow dephosphorylation of proteins involved in cell growth. Possible targets include Cdc2 kinase, its substrates or kinases downstream of p34Cdc2. Studies on Schizosaccharomyces pombeindicate that a protein termed sds22 is required in late mitosis to bind dis2 and sds21, two PP-1 isoforms, which activates enzymatic activity and alters substrate specificity (30Stone E.M. Yamano H. Kinoshita N. Yanagida M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 13-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), thereby supporting the notion of a binding protein involved in PP-1 activation and localization. Also, an association between the tumor suppressor protein RB and PP-1 have been observed in cells from mid-mitosis to early G1 (14Puntoni F. Villa-Moruzzi E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Rubin E. Tamrakar S. Ludlow J.W. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nelson D.A. Krucher N.A. Ludlow J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4528-4535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have observed elevated levels of phospho-Rb in cells lacking the PP-1G subunit. Given the knowledge that PP-1 dephosphorylates Rb protein, leading to its activation, it is plausible that impaired activation of PP-1, due to the absence of PP-1G, may result in increased phosphorylation of Rb protein, leading to its inactivation. However, Western blot analyses of nuclear fractions for the presence of PP-1CB, one of the isoforms of PP-1C subunit, revealed no differences in PP-1CB contents between wild-type L6 and PP-1GKO cells. This observation is not unexpected, given that PP-1C binds to nuclear inhibitor proteins NIPP-1 and NIPP-2, leading to inactivation of PP-1 enzymatic activity. We observed a decrease in cellular PP-1 enzymatic activity in PP-1G-depleted cells. Clearly, further studies are needed to understand the exact role of PP-1G subunit in the nuclear localization of PP-1 and its relationship to terminal differentiation of muscle cells. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the glycogen/SR-associated regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase-1, PP-1G, may play a vital role in coupling initial events of myogenesis to terminal differentiation, thereby facilitating the exit of cells from mitosis via increased dephosphorylation of proteins involved in mitosis."
