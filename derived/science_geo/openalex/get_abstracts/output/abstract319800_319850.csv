https://openalex.org/W2111752301,"Evidence obtained by means of rubber strip tests and an ozone recorder indicates the presence of abnormal concentrations of ozone in the atmosphere at times. Excellent correlation was obtained between appearance of ""weather fleck"" in tobacco and high values for ozone. The great similarity between lesions occurring naturally and those produced by ozone in chambers also indicates that ozone is the probable inciting agent of weather fleck. Varietal differences exist. Study of stomatal action helped to explain variation in leaf injury."

The following were without marked effect: glycine, thiamine, pyrodoxine, niacin, indoleacetic acid, gibberellic acid, kinetin, adenine, adenosinetriphosphate, biotin, riboflavin, calcium pantothenate, and folic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1999437627,"The possibility that the intricate ""organized elements"" found in some carbonaceous chondrites are to be interpreted, not as microfossils of once-living cells, but as organic-chemical analogues of similarly intricate snow crystals is raised; tests and implications are discussed."

Since this work is still going on, no definitive conclusions can be reached in regard to the many special studies which our raw data have made possible."
https://openalex.org/W2073517598,"The crystalline style of Saxidomus giganteus supports a large population of Cristispira spp. which swim freely in it except near the functional end which impinges on the gastric shield. Here the style is frayed and mixed with ground food material, while amylolytic enzymes and an oxidase are released. Glucosone appears to result from oxidase activity. This proved toxic to cristispira in fairly high dilution. Several tests of the toxicity of extracts of plankton, which forms the food of Saxidomus, were made. In every case such extracts proved toxic."
https://openalex.org/W1994950794,Five areas of outcrop were examined along 120 miles of the coast of the Bellingshausen Sea east of the Thurston Peninsula. Hornblende quartz diorite is the principal rock in the area and occurs in a body of batholithic dimensions. The quartz diorite contains inclusions of older granulitic rock and is cut by mafic dikes. An island in Paradise Harbor on the Palmer Peninsula was also examined briefly.
https://openalex.org/W2037192124,"Spores of race 2 but not of race 1 of Colletotrichum lagenarium are ingested by myxamoebas of strain NE-30 of the slime mold Acrasis rosea. Sporulating colonies of three heterocaryons of C. lagenarium involving auxotrophic strains with different color markers of races 1 and 2 were inoculated with myxamoebas. Although spores of race 1 produced on homocaryons were not ingested by the myxamoebas, they were ingested when produced on heterocaryons involving race 2. Spores from sectors of the heterocaryons yielded colonies of race 1; spores from these colonies were not ingested by the myxamoebas."

The inlet tube A should be inserted at a slight angle so that its lower end lies in the center of the round-bottomed tube within half an inch of the bottom. This end is covered with a piece of fine bolting-silk fastened with a rubber band. The bolting-silk breaks the force of the inflowing water, but more especially prevents the entrance of any foreign substance which might close the outlet. The upper end of tube A is connected by a rubber tube to the distilled water reservoir or faucet. The flow of water is regulated by screw compressor C. The outlet tube B has its inner arm a trifle longer than the outer arm, so that the U does The stopper and small tubes must fit tightly to maintain an air chamber between the stopper and the lower end of tube B. not act as a syphon. The inner arm of this tube is covered with bolting-silk also, to prevent the escape of any material which may float.2"
