https://openalex.org/W2074402500,"Although it is known that Parkinson's disease results from a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the resulting alterations in activity in the basal ganglia responsible for parkinsonian motor deficits are still poorly characterized. Recently, increased activity in the subthalamic nucleus has been implicated in the motor abnormalities. To test this hypothesis, the effects of lesions of the subthalamic nucleus were evaluated in monkeys rendered parkinsonian by treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The lesions reduced all of the major motor disturbances in the contralateral limbs, including akinesia, rigidity, and tremor. This result supports the postulated role of excessive activity in the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2006630070,"The S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase III (pol III) transcription factor TFIIIB binds to DNA upstream of the transcription start site of the SUP4 tRNA(Tyr) gene in a TFIIIC-dependent reaction and to the major 5S rRNA gene in a reaction requiring TFIIIC and TFIIIA. It is shown here that TFIIIB alone correctly positions pol III for repeated cycles of transcription on both genes, with the same efficiency as fully assembled transcription complexes. Thus, TFIIIB is the sole transcription initiation factor of S. cerevisiae pol III; TFIIIC and TFIIIA are assembly factors for TFIIIB. The TFIIIB-dependent binding of pol III to the SUP4 tRNA and 5S rRNA genes has been analyzed in binary (protein and DNA only) and precisely arrested ternary (protein, DNA, and RNA) transcription complexes. Pol III unwinds at least 14 bp of DNA at the SUP4 transcription start in a temperature-dependent process. The unwound DNA segment moves downstream with nascent RNA as a transcription bubble of approximately the same size."

https://openalex.org/W2004718349,Variation in internal minisatellite structure can be analyzed by mapping variant repeat units within amplified alleles. A system capable of distinguishing greater than 10(70) allelic states at the human hypervariable locus D1S8 has been developed. Population surveys of internal allelic structure indicate that D1S8 alleles evolve rapidly along haploid chromosome lineages. Internal mapping of deletion mutant alleles physically selected from genomic DNA provides further evidence that germline and somatic mutations altering the number of allelic repeat units seldom if ever arise by unequal exchange between alleles. The existence of low level germline mosaicism for new mutants further indicates that many germline mutation events are premeiotic. Physical selection of new mutants also allows minisatellite mutation rates to be estimated directly in human DNA.
https://openalex.org/W2055679500,"Endothelin (ET), originally characterized as a 21-residue vasoconstrictor peptide from endothelial cells, is present in the porcine spinal cord and may act as a neuropeptide. Endothelin-like immunoreactivity has now been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclear neurons and their terminals in the posterior pituitary of the pig and the rat. The presence of ET in the porcine hypothalamus was confirmed by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Moreover, in situ hybridization demonstrated ET messenger RNA in porcine paraventricular nuclear neurons. Endothelin-like immunoreactive products in the posterior pituitary of the rat were depleted by water deprivation, suggesting a release of ET under physiological conditions. These findings indicate that ET is synthesized in the posterior pituitary system and may be involved in neurosecretory functions."

https://openalex.org/W1490783082,"The abilities of various divalent cations to enter the cytoplasm of mouse lacrimal acinar cells was examined under resting and agonist-stimulated conditions, by monitoring their effects on the fluorescence of cytosolic fura-2. In vitro, Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ quenched the fura-2 fluorescence, whereas Sr2+, Ba2+, and La3+ produced an excitation spectrum and maximum brightness similar to Ca2+. Stimulation of mouse lacrimal acinar cells with methacholine (MeCh) caused a biphasic elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) resulting from a release of Ca2+ from intracellular pools followed by a sustained entry of extracellular Ca2+. Neither La3+ nor Ni2+ entered the cells under resting or stimulated conditions, but both blocked Ca2+ entry. Although both Co2+ and Mn2+ entered unstimulated cells, this process was not increased by MeCh. Both Sr2+ and Ba2+ were capable of supporting a sustained increase in fura-2 fluorescence in response to MeCh, indicating that these cations can enter the cells through the agonist-regulated channels. However, Sr2+, but not Ba2+, was capable of refilling the agonist-sensitive intracellular stores. These findings demonstrate dissociation of agonist-induced Ca2+ entry from intracellular Ca2+ pool refilling and thereby provide strong support for the recently modified version of the capacitative Ca2+ entry model according to which influx into the cytoplasm occurs directly across the plasma membrane and does not require a specialized cation channel directly linking the extracellular space and the intracellular Ca2+ stores."
https://openalex.org/W2037612112,"Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is used as a model system for the study of how a localized conformational change in a protein structure is produced and related to enzyme reactivity. An 11-residue loop region moves more than 7 angstroms and closes over the active site when substrate binds. The loop acts like a ""lid"" in that it moves rigidly and is attached by two hinges to the remainder of the protein. The nature of the motion appears to be built into the loop by conserved residues; the hinge regions, in contrast, are not conserved. Results of molecular dynamics calculations confirm the structural analysis and suggest a possible ligand-induced mechanism for loop closure."
https://openalex.org/W2165123145,"Three polypeptide chains, A, B1, and B2, have been described for mouse laminin, a basement membrane protein. We studied expression of laminin A, B1, and B2 mRNA in the developing mouse kidney. Induction of kidney mesenchyme differentiation in vitro led to an increased expression of B1 and B2 chain mRNA on day 1 of development. In contrast, expression of A chain mRNA increased on day 2, when epithelial cell polarization begins. Laminin A mRNA and polypeptide were expressed only by epithelia during in vivo development as well. Some polarized cell types producing basement membrane (endothelium, some adult epithelia) lacked the A chain mRNA and polypeptide, although thoy did express B chains. Laminin with the 400 kd A chain is therefore a transient form appearing at specific sites of kidney morphogenesis, whereas isoforms with a different A chain or without it have a more widespread distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2005432945,"Several pathways of transmembrane signaling in lymphocytes involve protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. With the exception of p56lck, a tyrosine kinase specific to T lymphoid cells that associates with the T cell transmembrane proteins CD4 and CD8, the kinases that function in these pathways are unknown. A murine lymphocyte complementary DNA that represents a new member of the src family has now been isolated and characterized. This complementary DNA, termed blk (for B lymphoid kinase), specifies a polypeptide of 55 kilodaltons that is related to, but distinct from, previously identified retroviral or cellular tyrosine kinases. The protein encoded by blk exhibits tyrosine kinase activity when expressed in bacterial cells. In the mouse and among cell lines, blk is specifically expressed in the B cell lineage. The tyrosine kinase encoded by blk may function in a signal transduction pathway that is restricted to B lymphoid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1532492916,"Tubulin, the major constituent protein of microtubules, is a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits. Both alpha and beta exist in multiple isotypic forms. It is not clear if different isotypes perform different functions. In order to approach this question, we have made a monoclonal antibody specific for the beta III isotype of tubulin. This particular isotype is neuron-specific and appears to be phosphorylated near the C terminus. We have used immunoaffinity depletion chromatography to prepare tubulin lacking the beta III subunit. We find that removal of the beta III isotype results in a tubulin mixture able to assemble much more rapidly than is unfractionated tubulin when reconstituted with either of the two microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), tau or MAP 2. Our results suggest that the different isotypes of tubulin differ from each other in their ability to polymerize into microtubules. We have also found that the anti-beta III antibody can stimulate microtubule assembly when reconstituted with tubulin and either tau or MAP 2. When reconstituted with tubulin lacking the beta III isotype, the antibody causes the tubulin to polymerize into a polymer that is a microtubule in the presence of MAP 2 and a ribbon in the presence of tau."
https://openalex.org/W1506049383,"The regulation of monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF)/interleukin 8 (IL 8) receptor expression by the MDNCF/IL 8 ligand was examined using freshly isolated human peripheral blood neutrophils. MDNCF/IL 8 down-regulated greater than 90% of its own receptor expression within 10 min at 37 degrees C. This down-regulation was associated with internalization of the ligand. The radiolabeled MDNCF/IL 8 molecules after internalization were proteolytically degraded, and trichloroacetic acid-soluble molecules were released into the culture medium starting at 60 min. Lysosomotropic agents could inhibit this degradation of ligand suggesting the involvement of lysosomal enzymes in this proteolytic digestion. MDNCF/IL 8 receptors reappeared on the cell surface within 10 min after removal of free ligands from the culture medium. Cycloheximide did not alter the reappearance of the receptor suggesting that de novo protein synthesis of MDNCF/Il 8 receptors is not involved in this event and that receptors probably recycled. The addition of lysosomotropic agents partially inhibited the reappearance/recycling of the receptors, although none of these agents inhibited the binding of ligand to the surface receptors or ligand internalization. Ammonium chloride reduced the MDNCF/IL 8-induced neutrophil chemotactic response in a dose-dependent fashion. These data suggest that MDNCF/IL 8 receptor expression is dynamically regulated by MDNCF/IL 8 and that the rapid recycling of MDNCF/IL 8 receptors may be essential for the chemotactic response of neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2061147475,"In order to investigate the potential for Borrelia burgdorferi infection before the recognition of Lyme disease as a clinical entity, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine museum specimens of Ixodes dammini (deer ticks) for the presence of spirochete-specific DNA sequences. One hundred and thirty-six archival tick specimens were obtained representing various continental U.S. locations; DNA sequences characteristic of modern day isolates of B. burgdorferi were detected in 13 1940s specimens from Montauk Point and Hither Hills, Long Island, New York. Five archival specimens of Dermacentor variabilis (dog tick) from the same collection and 118 Ixodes specimens from other endemic and nonendemic sites were negative. These data suggest that the appearance of the Lyme disease spirochete in suitable arthropod vectors preceded, by at least a generation, the formal recognition of this disease as a clinical entity in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W1992306463,"Novel, approximately 90 bp intervening sequences (IVs) were discovered within the 23S rRNA genes of S. typhimurium and S. arizonae. These non-rRNA sequences are transcribed and then excised during rRNA maturation. The rRNA fragments that result from the excision of the extra sequences are not religated. This results in fragmented 23S rRNAs. The excision of one IVS was shown to be catalyzed in vivo and in vitro by ribonuclease III. These IVSs are highly volatile evolutionarily, sometimes occurring in only some of the multiple rRNA operons of a particular cell. The sporadic nature of the occurrence of fragmented rRNAs among closely related organisms argues that such fragmentation is a derived state, not a primitive one. Possible sources of these IVSs, their parallels with internal transcribed spacers and introns in eukaryotes, and their possible roles in the evolutionary process are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1495275626,"Human alpha 1-antichymotrypsin has been cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli and recombinant protein as well as point-specific mutants have been purified and characterized. The corrected gene-deduced amino acid sequence has 45% overall identity with alpha 1-protease inhibitor, which is higher than the 42% previously reported (Chandra, T., Stackhouse, R., Kidd, V. J., Robson, J. H., and Woo, S. L. C. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5055-5060). Recombinant antichymotrypsin (rACT) is similar to natural antichymotrypsin with respect to the specificity of its interactions with proteases. Its second-order rate constant for association with bovine chymotrypsin is 6-8 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, which is identical to that of the serum-derived inhibitor. Site-specific mutagenesis has been used to produce two variants of rACT in which the P1 position has been changed from leucine to either methionine (L358M-rACT) or arginine (L358R-rACT). L358M-rACT has a specificity of inhibitory activity toward serine proteases closely similar to that of native rACT. By contrast, the specificity of L358R-rACT is quite different from that of native rACT, most notably in efficiently inhibiting trypsin and human thrombin while showing a decreased ability to inhibit chymotrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1674764723,"Characterization of the domain structure of DNA polymerase beta is reported. Large scale overproduction of the rat protein in Escherichia coli was achieved, and the purified recombinant protein was verified by sequencing tryptic peptides. This protein is both a single-stranded DNA binding protein and a DNA polymerase consisting of one polypeptide chain of 334 amino acids. As revealed by controlled proteolysis experiments, the protein is organized in two relatively protease-resistant segments linked by a short protease-sensitive region. One of these protease-resistant segments represents the NH2-terminal 20% of the protein. This NH2-terminal domain (of about 75 residues) has strong affinity for single-stranded nucleic acids. The other protease-resistant segment, representing the COOH-terminal domain of approximately 250 residues, does not bind to nucleic acids. Neither domain, tested as purified proteins, has substantial DNA polymerase activity. The results suggest that the NH2-terminal domain is principally responsible for the template binding activity of the intact protein."
https://openalex.org/W2005038253,"We have examined the effects of elevating the intracellular levels of p34cdc2 kinase by microinjection into living mammalian cells. These studies reveal rapid and dramatic changes in cell shape with cells becoming round and losing the bulk of their cell-substratum contact. Such effects were induced at all times in the cell cycle except at S phase and were fully reversible at S phase or mitosis. Similar results were obtained with the homogeneous catalytic subunit of p34cdc2 kinase or p34cdc2 kinase associated with cyclin B. These alterations were accompanied by a marked reduction in interphase microtubules without the spindle formation, actin microfilament redistribution, and premature chromatin condensation. Although these changes closely mimic the events occurring during early phases of mitosis, p34cdc2 kinase-injected cells were not induced to pass further into division. These data provide detailed evidence that p34cdc2 kinase plays a major prerequisite role in the rearrangement of cellular structures associated with mammalian cell mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1985596446,"Transcription of a typical eukaryotic gene by RNA polymerase II is activated by proteins bound to sites found near the beginning of the gene as well as to sites, called enhancers, located a great distance from the gene. According to one view, the primary difference between an activator that can work at a large distance and one that cannot is that the former bears a particularly strong activating region; the stronger the activating region, the more readily the activator interacts with its target bound near the transcriptional start site, with the intervening DNA looping out to accommodate the reaction. One alternative view is that the effect of proteins bound to enhancers might require some special aspect of cellular or chromosome structure. Consistent with the first view, an activator bearing an unusually potent activating region can stimulate transcription of a mammalian gene in a HeLa nuclear extract when bound as far as 1.3 kilobase pairs upstream or 320 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site."
https://openalex.org/W2146191130,"The function of the CD44 glycoprotein as an adhesion molecule was directly tested by transformation of a CD44 cDNA into mouse fibroblasts. This cDNA was expressed as a heavily modified cell surface protein reactive with monoclonal antibodies that recognize glycoproteins now identified in primates as CD44. Independent transfectants exhibited a new self-adhesive phenotype, forming large aggregates when placed in suspension. In variants derived from a clone of cells, aggregation competence segregated with expression of the transfected gene. This CD44-mediated adhesion was blocked specifically by monoclonal antibodies binding one immunologically defined region of CD44. Nontransfected L cells did not self-aggregate but were capable of adhering to the transfectants, indicating that at least one ligand for this adhesion molecule is expressed by mouse fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2034718650,"We have assessed the mechanism of intermediate filament assembly by assaying the sites of incorporation of chicken vimentin subunits expressed under the control of an inducible promoter in transfected mouse fibroblasts. The localization of newly synthesized vimentin was determined by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy at short time periods of induced synthesis, using antibodies specific for chicken vimentin. Under conditions where neither the soluble subunit pools nor the steady-state distribution of endogenous filaments are affected, newly synthesized vimentin incorporates into the vimentin filament network at numerous and discrete sites throughout the cell. Over time, the pattern of newly assembled vimentin converts to a continuous array coincident with preexisting vimentin filaments. These results are consistent with a novel mechanism of intermediate filament assembly, whereby growth of intermediate filaments occurs by topographically restricted and localized subunit addition, necessitating a transient disruption of filament integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1998407663,"The interaction between RAS proteins and adenylyl cyclase was studied by using dominant interfering mutations of adenylyl cyclase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RAS proteins activate adenylyl cyclase in this organism. A plasmid expressing a catalytically inactive adenylyl cyclase was found to interfere dominantly with this activation. The interfering region mapped to the leucine-rich repeat region of adenylyl cyclase, which is homologous to domains present in several other proteins and is thought to participate in protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1520653386,"A monomeric actin bundling protein with a native molecular weight of approximately 50,000 (ABP-50) has been isolated from amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum. ABP-50 cross-links F-actin to form tightly packed bundles, some of which are highly ordered. It exhibits a Kd of 2.1 microM and a molar ratio to actin of 1:1 in bundles. Calcium and ATP at physiological concentrations have no effect on these activities. ABP-50 is immunologically unrelated to 30-kDa protein, a previously described bundling protein from Dictyostelium. Immunofluorescence with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies indicates that ABP-50 is localized in regions of the amoeboid cell cortex containing actin bundles. The molar ratio of ABP-50 to actin is approximately 1:5 in vivo. Therefore, the abundance of ABP-50 suggests that it may be responsible for the majority of the bundling activity in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1491506353,"Phosphorylation of the insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (IRGT) is increased by incubating rat adipocytes with isoproterenol or by incubating microsomal membranes with cAMP-dependent protein kinase. To attempt to locate the sites of phosphorylation, the IRGT (apparent Mr = 46,000) was immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled adipocytes and cleaved with CNBr or trypsin. Essentially all of the 32P could be recovered in a single CNBr fragment, denoted CB-T (Mr = 8,000), which bound a polyclonal antibody (R820) against a peptide having the sequence of the last 12 amino acids in the COOH terminus of the IRGT. 32P-Labeling of the IRGT was also confined to CB-T when membranes were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Isoproterenol increased phosphorylation of CB-T, but insulin was without effect. To resolve phosphorylation sites further, IRGT from 32P-labeled cells was subjected to exhaustive proteolysis with trypsin. Samples were applied to a C-18 column, and 32P-labeled fragments were resolved into three peak fractions by elution with an increasing gradient of acetonitrile. [32P]Phosphoserine was the only phosphoamino acid detected in any of the peaks. Peak III contained approximately 80% of the 32P and was increased by isoproterenol. Almost all of the 32P introduced by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro eluted in Peak III. In all cases, the 32P-labeled species in Peak III were quantitatively immunoprecipitated by R820. Digesting the peptide(s) in Peak III with V8 protease generated a single peak of 32P which eluted at lower acetonitrile than Peak III and contained 32P-labeled species that did not interact with R820. Automated Edman degradation indicated that the serine residue in Peak III phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase was the 3rd or 4th residue from the NH2 terminus of the peptide. These findings indicate that phosphorylation of the IRGT is restricted to the presumed intracellular domain at the COOH terminus and that Ser488 is a major site phosphorylated both by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro and in response to isoproterenol in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1871951699,"Chronic (24 h) insulin treatment and/or glucose deprivation of differentiated rat L6 skeletal muscle cells resulted in an increase in glucose transport activity and a 2-3-fold increase in the number of plasma membrane-associated cytochalasin B binding sites and immunoreactive glucose transporters. In contrast to the acute effect of insulin, chronic treatment did not decrease the number of cytochalasin B binding sites or immunoreactive glucose transporter proteins present in intracellular low density microsomes. Although acute insulin stimulation of glucose transport activity was not affected by cycloheximide, chronic insulin stimulation of glucose transport activity and glucose transporter protein were decreased. In contrast, the stimulation of glucose transport activity by both acute and chronic glucose deprivation were cycloheximide-insensitive. Previously we have reported that chronic insulin treatment transiently induces the rat brain/HepG2 glucose transporter subtype (GLUT-1) mRNA, whereas glucose deprivation induces a substained increase (Walker, P. S., Ramlal, T., Donovan, J. A., Doering, T. P., Sandra, A., Klip, A., and Pessin, J. E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6587-6595). Consistent with these data, nuclear run-on analysis demonstrated a transient 3-fold increase in the rate of GLUT-1 glucose transporter mRNA transcription induced by either chronic insulin treatment or glucose deprivation. The combination of chronic insulin treatment with glucose deprivation resulted in a more persistent 3-4-fold increase in transcription rate than either treatment alone. These data demonstrate that prolonged insulin- and glucose-dependent regulation of glucose transporter function occurs by a complex mechanism which includes enhanced GLUT-1 mRNA transcription and glucose transporter synthesis, as well as changes in the subcellular distribution of glucose transporter proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1492751534,"DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme) is the 10-subunit replicase of the Escherichia coli chromosome. In this report, pure preparations of delta, delta', and a gamma chi psi complex are resolved from the five protein gamma complex subassembly. Using these subunits and other holoenzyme subunits isolated from overproducing plasmid strains of E. coli, the rapid and highly processive holoenzyme has been reconstituted from only five pure single subunits: alpha, epsilon, gamma, delta, and beta. The preceding report showed that of the three subunits in the core polymerase, only a complex of alpha (DNA polymerase) and epsilon (3'-5' exonuclease) are required to assemble a processive holoenzyme on a template containing a preinitiation complex (Studwell, P.S., and O'Donnell, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1171-1178). This report shows that of the five proteins in the gamma complex only a heterodimer of gamma and delta is required with the beta subunit to form the ATP-activated preinitiation complex with a primed template. Surprisingly, the delta' subunit does not form an active complex with gamma but forms a fully active heterodimer complex with the tau subunit (as does delta). Hence, the tau delta' and gamma delta heterodimers are fully active in the preinitiation complex reaction with beta and primed DNA. Holoenzymes reconstituted using the alpha epsilon complex, beta subunit, and either gamma delta or tau delta' are fully processive in DNA synthesis, and upon completing the template they rapidly cycle to a new primed template endowed with a preinitiation complex clamp. Since the holoenzyme molecule contains all of these accessory subunits (gamma, delta, tau, delta', and beta) in all likelihood it has the capacity to form two preinitiation complex clamps simultaneously at two primer termini. Two primer binding components within one holoenzyme may mediate its rapid cycling to multiple primers on the lagging strand and also provides functional evidence for the hypothesis of holoenzyme as a dimeric polymerase capable of simultaneous replication of both leading and lagging strands of a replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W1576996961,"Much of the tissue damage associated with emphysema and other inflammatory diseases has been attributed to the proteolytic activity of neutrophil elastase, a major component of the azurophil granule. Recently, two additional azurophil granule proteins with NH2-terminal sequence homology to elastase were isolated (Gabay, J. E., Scott, R. W., Campanelli, D., Griffith, J., Wilde, C., Marra, M. N., Seeger, M., and Nathan, C. F. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 5610-5614) and designated azurophil granule protein 7 (AGP7) and azurocidin. Azurocidin and AGP7 represent significant protein components of the azurophil granule, together comprising approximately 15% of the acid-extractable protein as judged by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis. AGP7 migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as four distinct glycoforms of molecular mass 28-34 kDa, whereas azurocidin exhibits three predominant bands with molecular mass of 28-30 kDa. Treatment of intact azurophil granules with [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate resulted in labeling of elastase, cathepsin G, and AGP7, whereas azurocidin was not labeled. Tryptic mapping of 3H-labeled AGP7 allowed us to identify and sequence the active-site polypeptide that has 70% identity to elastase over 20 residues. The active site peptide of azurocidin was also identified by sequence analysis of tryptic fragments and showed 65% identity to the active site of elastase. Surprisingly, the catalytic serine of azurocidin is replaced by glycine, explaining its inability to label with [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Thus, we have identified two azurophil proteins closely related to neutrophil elastase, one of which has apparently lost its proteolytic activity due to mutation of the catalytic serine."
https://openalex.org/W1524059637,"We have purified extensively the transcriptional activator, GAL4, from a yeast strain overexpressing the gene product from the ADH1 promoter. Our purification followed GAL4 activity by its binding to a specific DNA target sequence, using filter binding assays. No specific binding activity was detected in extracts from a strain containing a disrupted copy of the GAL4 gene. The purification protocol included fractionation of a whole cell extract by ion-exchange and DNA-affinity chromatography on a column containing a 17-base pair oligomer encoding a near consensus GAL4 binding site. Two polypeptides co-eluted with the GAL4 DNA binding activity from the DNA-affinity column. One had an apparent molecular mass of 99 kDa (the predicted size of the GAL4 protein) and cross-reacted with antibodies raised against GAL4 epitopes from fusion proteins expressed in bacterial cells. The second polypeptide did not cross-react with the anti-GAL4 antibody and is presumed to be the GAL80 transcriptional repressor based on its size (48 kDa) and known physical association with the GAL4 protein. GAL4 binding activity elutes from a gel filtration column as a 155-kDa species suggesting that it exists in solution in a heterodimer complex of one GAL4 and one GAL80 molecule. The dissociation constant of the DNA-affinity-purified GAL4-GAL80 complex for a 900-base pair DNA fragment containing the UASGAL element from the GAL1-GAL10 divergent promoter was, Kd(effective) (0.15 M KCl) = 2.4 x 10(-9) M."
https://openalex.org/W1973547505,"An essential part of the chromosome replication origin of E. coli K-12 and B/r was replaced by the plasmid pOU71. The average initiation mass of replication for pOU71 decreases with increasing temperature. The constructed strains were grown exponentially at different temperatures, and cell sizes and DNA content were measured by flow cytometry. The average DNA content increased with increasing temperature, but the cell size distribution was largely unaffected. Furthermore, cells in which DNA replication had not yet initiated (cells in the B period) became less abundant with increasing temperature. The increased DNA content could not be explained by an increase in the length of the C period. It is concluded that chromosome replication does not trigger cell division in E. coli, but that the chromosome replication and cell division cycles of E. coli run in parallel independently of each other."
https://openalex.org/W1602775041,"12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) activated the c-fos gene enhancer linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase reporter gene in the wild type PC-12 cells but not in the variant PC-12 cells that originated from the wild type cells. Transfection of the c-Ha-rasval12 complementary DNA (cDNA) or addition of dibutyryl cAMP to the wild type PC-12 cells as well as to the variant PC-12 cells activated the c-fos gene enhancer. Prolonged treatment of the wild type PC-12 cells with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate caused down-regulation of protein kinase C. In these cells, TPA did not stimulate the c-fos gene enhancer any more, but transfection of the c-Ha-rasval12 cDNA still stimulated the c-fos gene enhancer to the same extent as induced in the control cells. Transfection of the c-Ha-rasval12 cDNA or addition of TPA to the wild type PC-12 cells stimulated the serum-response element but not the cAMP-response element. Dibutyryl cAMP stimulated both the serum-response element and the cAMP-response element in the wild type PC-12 cells. These results indicate that the c-Ha-rasval12 protein activates the serum-response element, but not the cAMP-response element in the c-fos gene enhancer, and that the signal pathway from the c-Ha-rasval12 protein to the c-fos serum-response element is independent of protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1534923027,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ornithine transcarbamoylase and arginase form a regulatory multienzyme complex (Hensley, P. (1988) Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 29, 35-75). In this complex, arginase acts as a negative allosteric effector for ornithine transcarbamoylase. Before an analysis of the factors which promote and stabilize complex formation, arginase was purified in milligram quantities from a plasmid-containing, enzyme-overproducing, protease-deficient yeast strain and its physical characterization undertaken. The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 885 mumol urea min-1 mg-1 and a Km for arginine of 15.7 mM. The ultraviolet spectrum has a maximum absorbance at 279 nm, and the steady-state fluorescence emission spectrum has a maximum intensity at 337 nm, suggesting that the 3 tryptophans/polypeptide chain are in a relatively hydrophobic environment. Arginase has a weakly bound manganese responsible for the maintenance of the catalytic activity and is known to be heat activated in the presence of manganese. This effect is half-maximal at 12.1 microM manganese. In addition to a catalytic requirement for manganese, the presence of a more tightly bound metal is suggested from sedimentation studies. The native trimeric enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 5.95 S. Removal of the weakly associated metal results in no change in the sedimentation coefficient. However, dialysis with EDTA causes the s-value to decrease to 4.65 S, suggesting that under these conditions, the trimeric enzyme may partially dissociate. An analysis of CD spectra shows that significant spectral changes result from the removal of both the weakly bound metal and dialysis against EDTA."

The glycoconjugates produced by the cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine and extracted with 4 M guanidine HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The radiolabeled glycoconjugates were separated on DEAE-Sephacel and compared with those synthesized by glomeruli labeled in the same conditions. Of the three major sulfated glycoconjugates, sulfated glycoprotein (17% of the total 35S-labeled macromolecules), heparan sulfate proteoglycan (35%), and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (30%) synthesized by glomeruli, the cultured mesangial cells synthesized mainly chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (more than 90%). After purification by CsCl density-gradient centrifugation, the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan from the cell layer was separated on Bio-Gel A-5m into three molecular species with estimated Mr values of 230,000, 150,000, and 40,000-10,000, whereas that released into the medium consisted of a single species with an Mr of 135,000. In the beta-elimination reaction, the former two larger proteoglycans released chondroitin sulfate chains with Mr of an apparent 30,000 and the latter from the medium released the glycosaminoglycan chains with an Mr of 36,000. The Mr of the smallest proteoglycan from the cell layer was not significantly changed after beta-elimination, indicating that this species had only a small peptide, if any. Analysis with chondroitinase AC-II and ABC demonstrated that all the chondroitin sulfates were copolymers consisting of glucuronosyl-N-acetylgalactosamine (65-74%) having sulfate groups at position 4 (53-57%) or positions 4 and 6 (10-14%) of hexosamine moieties and iduronosyl-N-acetylgalactosamine (21-26%) having sulfate groups at position 4 (17-23%) or positions 4 and 6 (about 3%) of hexosamine moieties; namely chondroitin sulfate H type. These characteristics of the chondroitin sulfate H proteoglycans synthesized by the cultured mesangial cells were very similar to those of the proteoglycans synthesized by glomeruli. Thus, we conclude that most, if not all, of the glomerular chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are synthesized by mesangial cells. The cultured mesangial cells were also found to synthesize hyaluronic acid at a similar level to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Based on the characteristics of this glycosaminoglycan, we discuss the possible role of hyaluronic acid produced by mesangial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1568487852,"We have investigated the oligosaccharides in the human transferrin receptor from three different cell lines. During our studies on the structures of the N-linked oligosaccharides of the receptor, we discovered that the receptor contains O-linked oligosaccharides. This report describes the isolation and characterization of these O-linked oligosaccharides. Three different human cell lines--K562, A431, and BeWo--were grown in media containing either [2-3H] mannose or [6-3H]glucosamine. The newly synthesized and radiolabeled transferrin receptors were purified by immunoprecipitation from cell extracts and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The receptor was proteolytically digested or treated directly with mild base/borohydride. The released radiolabeled glycopeptides and oligosaccharides were separated by a variety of chromatographic techniques, and their structures were analyzed. The transferrin receptor from all three cell types contains O-linked oligosaccharides that are released from peptide by mild base/borohydride treatment. The receptor from K562 cells contains at least one O-linked oligosaccharide having two sialic acid residues and a core structure of the disaccharide galactose-N-acetyl-galactosamine. In contrast, the O-linked oligosaccharides in the transferring receptors from both A431 and BeWo cell lines are not as highly sialylated and were identified as both the neutral disaccharide galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine and the neutral monosaccharide N-acetylgalactosamine. In addition, the receptors from all three cell lines contain both complex-type and high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides. The complex-type chains in the receptor from A431 cells have properties of blood group A antigens, whereas oligosaccharides in receptors from both BeWo and K562 cells lack these properties. These results are interesting since both A431 and BeWo cells, but not K562 cells, are positive for blood group A antigens. Thus, our results demonstrate that the human transferrin receptor contains O-linked oligosaccharides and that there are differences in the structures of both the O-linked and complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides on the receptors synthesized by different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1495462148,"The rat liver asialoglycoprotein receptor or rat hepatic lectin (RHL) consists of two polypeptide species, a major one designated RHL-1 and a minor one designated RHL-2/3, which exists in two differentially glycosylated forms. We have studied the biosynthesis, targeting, and function of the different forms after transfection of their cDNAs into the polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line. In cells expressing only RHL-1, newly synthesized protein undergoes rapid intracellular degradation and is not detected at the cell surface. In contrast, RHL-2/3 when transfected alone is much more stable and is expressed at the basolateral surface of fiber-grown cells. When both forms are expressed together, newly synthesized RHL-1 escapes rapid degradation and is detected at the basolateral surface. In double transfectants a functional receptor is formed that specifically endocytoses and degrades ligand at the basolateral side."
https://openalex.org/W1545107851,"The nature of endogenous acceptor molecules implicated in the membrane-directed synthesis of the polysialic acid (polySia) capsule in Escherichia coli K1 serotypes is not known. The capsule contains at least 200 sialic acid (Sia) residues that are elongated by the addition of new Sia residues to the nonreducing termini of growing nascent chains (Rohr, T. E., and Troy, F. A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2332-2342). Presumably, chain growth starts when activated Sia residues are transferred to acceptors that are not already sialylated. In the present study, we used an acapsular mutant defective in synthesis of CMP-NeuAc to label acceptors with [14C]NeuAc and an anti-polySia-specific antibody (H.46) to identify the molecules to which the polySia was attached. [14C]Sia-labeled acceptors were solubilized with 2% Triton X-100, immunoprecipitated with H.46, and partially depolymerized with poly-alpha-2,8-endo-N-acetylneuraminidase. Approximately 5% of the [14C]Sia incorporated remained attached to endogenous acceptors. Double-labeling experiments were used to show that the non-Sia moiety of the acceptor was labeled in vivo with [14C]leucine and elongated in vitro with CMP-[3H]NeuAc. Concomitant with desialylation of the [3H]polySia-[14C]Leu acceptor was the appearance of a new [14C]Leu-labeled protein at 20 kDa. After strong acid hydrolysis, the 20-kDa labeled protein was shown to contain [14C]Leu. The acceptor molecules were not labeled metabolically with D-[3H]GlcN, 35SO4, or 32PO4, indicating that they do not appear to contain lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, phosphatidic acid, or phospholipid. Based on these results, we conclude that the endogenous acceptor molecule is a membrane protein of about 20 kDa. The nature of attachment of polySia to acceptor is unknown. There are only 400-500 acceptor molecules/cell, which is about 100-fold fewer than the 50,000 polySia chains/cell. This suggests that each acceptor molecule may participate in the shuttling of about 100 polySia chains/cell. We hypothesize that the acceptor protein may function to translocate polySia chains from their site of synthesis on the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane to the periplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1624935306,"12-Lipoxygenases oxygenate arachidonic acid producing its 12S-hydroperoxy derivative and are well known as platelet and leukocyte enzymes. When a peroxidase-linked immunoassay of the enzyme according to the avidin-biotin method was applied to the cytosol fractions from various parts of porcine brain, a considerable amount of the enzyme was found in the anterior pituitary. The enzyme level (about 200 ng/mg cytosol protein) corresponded to about 6% of the enzyme content in porcine peripheral leukocytes. Posterior and intermediate lobes showed about one-tenth of the enzyme level of anterior pituitary. Other parts of porcine brain contained the 12-lipoxygenase in amounts below 7 ng/mg cytosol protein. The cytosol fraction (0.7 mg of protein) of anterior pituitary produced 12S-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid from 25 microM arachidonic acid in about 34% conversion at 24 degrees C for 5 min, giving a specific enzyme activity about 3 nmol/min/mg protein. Furthermore, various octadecapolyenoic acids were oxygenated almost as fast as the arachidonate 12-oxygenation. When anterior pituitary was investigated immunohistochemically with anti-12-lipoxygenase antibody, most of the immunostained cells were certain parenchymal cells with granules, which were not blood cells. These biochemical and immunohistochemical results provide a good reason for considering that 12-lipoxygenase does play an important role in pituitary function."
https://openalex.org/W1914953853,"Antibodies to an Mr 64,000 protein from human or rat islets have been detected at high frequency in newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetic patients. In this study, we show that the antigenic and amphiphilic properties of the rat islet Mr 64,000 protein resemble that of the human protein. We have analyzed the expression of the Mr 64,000 protein in populations of pancreatic beta and non-beta cells and in selected rat tissues by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-radiolabeled proteins with sera from diabetic patients or from healthy control individuals. When islet cell populations enriched in beta or non-beta cells were tested for the expression of the Mr 64,000 antigen, the protein was primarily observed in the beta cells. On analyzing preparations of islets, liver, kidney, thyroid, adrenal, pituitary, spleen, and thymus, the protein could only be detected in islets. The protein was also characterized in terms of its subcellular localization by Percoll density gradient centrifugation and was recovered in a fraction enriched in the plasma membrane marker, 5'-nucleotidase. These results are consistent with a beta cell-restricted plasma membrane expression of the protein and support the hypothesis that this protein is a target antigen of beta cell-specific autoimmunity in insulin-dependent diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W1502068855,"In higher plants and algae, the transduction of captured light energy is highly regulated as excess excitation of photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers can be redirected to photosystem I (PSI) reaction centers. Models that attempt to explain this phenomenon involve light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complexes (LHCII) that capture light energy and migrate between PSII and PSI. This report shows that in pea chloroplasts, the major protein component of LHCII, light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein (LHCP), can indeed migrate within the thylakoid membrane. We show, however, that although newly imported LHCP inserts into both stacked and unstacked thylakoid membranes, it then moves only from the unstacked, PSI-rich membranes to the stacked, PSII-rich membranes. The observed migration is not affected by light treatment that induces a redistribution of captured light energy (state I-state II transition) that previously was thought to induce LHCP to migrate in the opposite direction, from stacked to unstacked membranes. A mutation that removes the site of LHCP phosphorylation, the proposed trigger of state transitions, also has no effect on the integration and movement of LHCP, but does render LHCP more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. These results are not consistent with current models that deal with the short-term change in the distribution of light energy."
https://openalex.org/W2121150436,"Glycyl-tRNA synthetase is one of two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in Escherichia coli that is comprised of heterologous subunits which are organized in an alpha 2 beta 2 quaternary structure. The two subunits are encoded by a single mRNA with the region for alpha (303 codons) subunit followed by that for beta (689 codons) subunit. Five COOH-terminal deletions in the beta subunit coding region have been created. Each deletion protein has been investigated for its synthesis and stability in vivo, adenylate synthesis activity in vitro, and aminoacylation activity in vivo and in vitro. This has been done in the presence of free alpha subunit and, additionally, with alpha subunit that is fused by its carboxyl terminus to the amino terminus of each of the beta subunit deletion proteins. With a fused or unfused alpha chain, over 100 amino acids can be deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the beta chain without loss of in vivo complementation of a delta glyS (deletion) strain. Further analysis shows that the alpha subunit and approximately the amino-terminal half of the beta subunit are sufficient for the adenylate synthesis activity. In particular, a deletion of 306 amino acids from the COOH terminus of the beta subunit has little effect on the Km parameter for ATP or glycine in the pyrophosphate exchange reaction. The tRNA-dependent step in aminoacylation requires additional beta subunit sequences on the COOH-terminal side of those needed for adenylate synthesis. In these respects, the functional organization of the beta chain parallels that of several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases which have only homologous subunits. In the case of the glycine enzyme, however, the heterologous alpha subunit is required for the elucidation of activities encoded by functional determinants of the beta chain."
https://openalex.org/W1557900013,"We previously described a novel insulin-stimulated protein kinase activity that phosphorylates Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) in cytosolic extracts of adipocytes (Yu, K-T., Khalaf, N., and Czech, M. P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16677-16685). In the present experiments, cytosolic extracts of livers from insulin-treated rats also exhibited a 30-100% increase in this Kemptide kinase activity and served as an abundant source for purification. The Kemptide kinase was purified in parallel from liver extracts of insulin-treated or control rats through five chromatographic steps and one polyethylene glycol precipitation. The chromatographic behavior of the insulin-stimulated Kemptide kinase differed significantly from the control kinase on Mono Q and heparin-Sepharose resins. The purified kinase preparations retain insulin stimulations of 2-10-fold. Analysis of the purified control and insulin-stimulated kinases by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed single bands with similar silver staining intensity and apparent molecular masses of 52 kDa. The insulin-stimulated Kemptide phosphorylating activity also coincided with the major silver-stained band following isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels. The stimulation of kinase activity in response to administration of insulin is due to an increase in Vmax, whereas the Km for Kemptide (0.3 mM) is unchanged. The apparent molecular mass of the native kinase determined by gel filtration is approximately 50 kDa, suggesting that it exists as a monomer. Either Mg2+ or Mn2+ serve as cofactors for the kinase which phosphorylates a variety of basic substrates including a number of peptides and histones. The activity of the Kemptide kinase is not changed by several compounds that have been shown to modulate other kinases. Based on these data, we conclude 1) a novel insulin-sensitive Kemptide kinase in liver cytosol has been purified to near homogeneity, and 2) insulin administration acutely modulates the specific activity of this Kemptide kinase in livers of intact rats."
https://openalex.org/W1521389007,"The nature of the primary biochemical lesions in genetically obese mice, which might prove to be useful models for human obesity, remains totally obscure. The recent finding that the expression of adipsin was virtually suppressed in both db/db and ob/ob adult mice has opened new perspectives, suggesting a potential role for this defect in the pathogenesis of obesity. To be of etiological significance, adipsin deficiency must be present very early in life when excess fat storage starts to develop. We show here that at 10 days of age db/db pups exhibit significantly overdeveloped adipose tissue as compared with lean (+/db) pups but similar levels of both adipose tissue adipsin mRNA and serum adipsin. Adipsin expression was still normal in obese mice 15 days old but frankly deficient at 30 days of age when hyperinsulinemia has developed. Thus the defect in adipsin expression in db/db mice is a secondary feature which cannot be ascribed a role in the onset of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1608162799,"Enzyme I is the first protein of the phospho transfer sequence in the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. This protein exhibits a temperature-dependent monomer/dimer equilibrium. The nucleotide sequence of Escherichia coli ptsI indicates four -SH residues per subunit (Saffen, D. W., Presper, K. A., Doering, T. L., and Roseman, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16241-16253). In the present experiments, the sulfhydryl groups of the E. coli enzyme were studied with various -SH-specific reagents. Titration of Enzyme I with 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid also revealed four reacting -SH groups. The kinetics of the 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid reaction with Enzyme I exhibit biphasic character, with pseudo-first order rate constants of 2.3 x 10(-2)/s and 2.3 x 10(-3)/s at pH 7.5, at room temperature. Fractional amplitudes associated with the rate constants were 25 +/- 5% for the and 75 +/- 5% for the rate. The slow rate was influenced by ligands that react with Enzyme I (the protein HPr, Mg2+, Mg2+ plus P-enolpyruvate), and also by temperature (at the temperature range where the monomer/dimer association occurs). The fractional ratio of the two rates remained at 1:3 under these conditions. Thus, under all conditions tested, two classes of -SH groups were detected, one reacting more rapidly than the other three -SH groups. Modification of the fast -SH group results in an active enzyme capable of forming dimer, whereas modification of the -SH groups results in inactive and monomeric Enzyme I. The enzyme was labeled with pyrene maleimide under conditions where only the more reactive sulfhydryl group was derivatized. Hydrolysis by trypsin followed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the peptide mixture resulted in only one fluorescent peak. This peak was not observed when the more reactive sulfhydryl residue was protected prior to pyrene maleimide labeling. Amino acid sequencing of the fluorescent peak indicated that the more reactive residue is the C-terminal amino acid residue, cysteine 575. The results provide a means for selectively labeling Enzyme I with a fluorophore at a single site while retaining full catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1562405700,"We have examined the interaction of thrombin with fibrinogen A alpha chain residues 7-16. Using genetically engineered constructions, we have synthesized in Escherichia coli a fibrinogen A alpha 1-50 fusion protein and seven mutant proteins with single amino acid substitutions. These are: Asp7----Ala, Phe8----Tyr, Glu11----Ala, Gly12----Val, Gly13----Val, Gly14----Val, and Arg16----Leu. Competitive immunoassay of cell lysates showed that all the mutations but one, Arg16----Leu, altered the structure of the protein such that cross-reactivity with the A alpha-specific monoclonal antibody, Y18, was significantly reduced. The fusion proteins were purified and analyzed as thrombin inhibitors and substrates. All the fusion proteins are competitive inhibitors of the amidolytic hydrolysis of Spectrozyme TH, a thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate, with inhibition constants corresponding to that for fibrinogen. We conclude that these 7 amino acid substitutions do not alter thrombin binding to the fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were tested as substrates by monitoring thrombin-dependent peptide release. The natural sequence and three mutants, Asp7----Ala, Glu11----Ala, and Gly14----Val, are good substrates. The other mutants are either poor substrates or are not cleaved by thrombin within A alpha 1-50. These results indicate that residues between Asp7 and Arg16 are critical to efficient peptide hydrolysis, whereas residues outside this region are critical to thrombin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1603166580,"The mitogenic effect of human fibrinogen on the hemopoietic cell lines Raji and JM is mediated by a specific receptor with biochemical and functional properties different from those of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, the glycoprotein complex IIb-IIIa (Levesque, J.P., Hatzfeld, A., and Hatzfeld, J. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 83, 6494-6498; Levesque, J.P., Hatzfeld, A., Hudry-Clergeon, G., Wilner, G.D., and Hatzfeld, J. (1987) J. Cell. Physiol. 232, 303-310). This work describes the identification of the mitogenic fibrinogen receptor (MFR) by two independent methods, affinity chromatography and covalent cross-linking. Affinity chromatography of surface-labeled cell extracts on fibrinogen-Sepharose revealed a 94 +/- 2-kDa membrane protein that bound specifically to fibrinogen-Sepharose only on cells that expressed the MFR. Its molecular mass was not modified after reduction. This was confirmed by cross-linking fibrinogen to surface-labeled Raji cells using the cleavable cross-linkers, ethyleneglycobis(succinimidyl succinate) and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). Complexes between fibrinogen and iodinated cell membrane proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-fibrinogen antibodies. The biochemical cleavage of these immunoprecipitated conjugates gave rise to a 92 +/- 3-kDa membrane protein whose molecular mass was not modified after reduction. We conclude that fibrinogen binds specifically to a 92-94-kDa MFR which does not belong to the integrin family."
https://openalex.org/W1578922669,"Enzyme I of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) exhibits a temperature-dependent monomer/dimer equilibrium. The accompanying paper (Han, M. K., Roseman, S., and Brand, L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1985-1995) shows that the C-terminal -SH residue (Cys-575) can be modified specifically with fluorescent probes such as pyrene maleimide. The derivative retains full enzyme activity, and is capable of forming dimers at room temperature. In the present studies, Enzyme I labeled in this way is found to exhibit a temperature-, concentration-, and pH-dependent monomer/dimer association. The kinetics of dimer formation of Enzyme I is measured in the following way. A derivatized Enzyme I sample is prepared with a pyrene moiety irreversibly attached to the C-terminal -SH residue and 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid reversibly attached to the other 3 -SH residues. This modified enzyme does not form dimers at room temperature. Addition of dithiothreitol results in total release of the thionitrobenzoate anion within 2 min. After the three -SH groups are unblocked, steady-state and nanosecond time-resolved emission anisotropy measurements indicate the dimer is formed over a period of 30 min. In a similar experiment, little dimer formation is observed at 3 degrees C, at temperature at which the native enzyme also does not form dimers. Tryptophan fluorescence is also examined during the release of the thionitrobenzoate. After the completion of thionitrobenzoate release, additional slow steady-state tryptophan fluorescence changes are observed. These results suggest that dimer formation may be preceded by a conformational change following thionitrobenzoate release."
https://openalex.org/W1599991389,"When a derivatized oligosaccharide isolated from ovalbumin and containing 6 mannose residues was incubated with yeast membranes and GDP-mannose, two sets of products were obtained, a high molecular weight one containing about 25 mannose residues and a low molecular weight one consisting of compounds with 7, 8, and 9 mannose residues, respectively. When the low molecular weight products were reincubated with the yeast membranes and GDP-mannose, no further mannose incorporation was observed, showing that these compounds must be of the wrong structure as substrates for yeast glycan processing enzymes. The structures were investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The high molecular weight products contained an outer chain of an average length of 18 1----6-linked mannose residues attached to a core structure made up of the original 6 mannose residues with one additional 1----2-linked mannose added. The low molecular weight product with 8 mannose residues was deduced to contain a terminal 1----6-linked mannose (on the 1----6 arm) substituted by mannose at the 2-position, and the ones with 7 and 9 mannose residues were identified as having an additional 1----3-linked mannose on the starting Man6 substrate and on the Man8 product, respectively. The results lend further support to the picture that the processing steps must occur in proper sequence for specific products to form."

https://openalex.org/W1927624315,"The structure of microtubule assembly inhibitor protein (MIP) was studied by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and limited proteolysis. Spin-diffusion experiments revealed that MIP has a tightly folded structure, a This globule was irreversibly denatured by heat treatment at 80 degrees C, and the denatured MIP showed little ability to inhibit microtubule assembly. This indicates that the native globular structure is essential for the activity. By spin-diffusion and spin-echo experiments, the other part of the molecule was found to be mobile. We termed the region highly mobile Most of the acidic residues appeared to be clustered in the mobile coils. By limited proteolysis using subtilisin, the mobile region was digested into shorter pieces, and a single 17-kDa fragment remained. Proton NMR spectrum of this fragment was much the same as the spin-diffusion subspectra of the rigid globule in the intact MIP molecule. Furthermore, the 17-kDa fragment was found to retain the activity to inhibit the microtubule assembly. These results indicate that MIP consists of two moieties; one domain forms a rigid globule which is essential for its activity to inhibit microtubule assembly, and the other acidic one is mobile and tails from the globule. The tertiary structures of these two domains appear to be independent from each other. These domains may be responsible for two different functions of MIP, the interaction with the cytoskeleton and the interaction with, for example, nuclear components."
